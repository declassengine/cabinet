GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs have been taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending .15th March : General Survey of Hie Labour Situation for the Week. The most important development in the general industrial situation which has taken place in the course of the week is the formal invitation of the national federation of building trades operatives to the triple alliance, requesting the latter body to take into immediate consideration the question of convening a conference of the principal trade unions, affected, to formulate a common policy to meet the attack alleged to be contemplated by employers on wages and conditions of work. The trade unions which the federation wish to take part in the conference are the miners&apos; federation of Great Britain, the national union of railwaymen, the national transport workers&apos; federation, the federation, of engineering and shipbuilding trades and the national federation of building trades operatives. The proposal of the building trades federation was apparently put forward at a meeting of the emergency committee on the 8th March, and will be discussed on the 17th by the sub-committee of the triple alliance, which consists of the presidents and secretaries of the constituent bodies. It will be remembered that the sub-committee of the alliance also met on the 8th March to consider the advisability of calling a full conference of the alliance to - discuss the position created in the coal mining industry by the Governments proposals for decontrol, and decided not to convene such a conference at the present time. The proposal of the building trades federation is in consonance with recently expressed opinions of prominent officials in the national transport workers&apos; federation, the miners&apos; federation,&apos; and also the national union of railwaymeu. It appears very probable, however, that the triple alliance will pass on the request of the building-trades to the parliamentary committee of the trades union congress.The conferences between employers and employed which have taken place in the course of the week have not led to any conclusive results. The principal conferences have been concerned with the mining, shipbuilding and engineering industries, and in each case reductions in wages are definitely proposed. The meeting of the national maritime board on the 17th March will bring the seafaring industry into the list of trades in which wages reductions are imminent. The national union of railwaymen have now formulated a declaration hostile to decontrol, and in favour of the national-ization of railways, and the three unions concerned with the railway industry are now at one on these questions. It would appear that in many industries it is not necessarily plain wages reductions that will cause serious trouble. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the adoption of a cost-of-living sliding scale, at the time when such a scale will probably mean a series of reductions in wages, is the declared policy of the unions in the building, hosiery, ancl vehicle building trades, and in the latter two cases has been, definitely put forward in response to employers&apos; demands for immediately reduced wages. What is very much feared, however, is that attempts will be made to alter the standard of conditions of work, the achievement of which by the trade unions concerned was so prominent a feature of the year 191.9. The builders fear payment by results, and the railwaymen an attack upon their guaranteed 48-hour week : while the miners are sore at the action of the owners in deciding to terminate contracts of employment on the 31st March before the national negotiations with the miners&apos; federation have definitely proved abortive. This would appear to be the strongest force behind the proposals to raise special unemployment funds which are now being-canvassed not only within the miners&apos; federation, but also within the national union of railwaymen and the boilermakers&apos; society. In the case of the national union of railwaymen, the avowed purpose of raising the fund is to provide unemployed members with a more substantial maintenance allowance in order to lessen the temptation to accept employment under worse conditions.        -
EGYPT.Neio Ministry. On 16th March Lord Allenby reported [No. 175] the formation of .-a ministry by Adly Pasha :  ,Adly Yeghen Pasha        ... President.Hussein Itushdi Pasha    ... Vice-President.Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha      -        - Interior.Ismail Sidki Pasha        ... Finance.Gaafer Waly Pasha        - .       -        - Education.Ahmed Ziwer Pasha      - Communications.Midhat Yeghen Pasha     -        -        - Wakfs.Mohammed Shell Is. Pasha - Public Works.Neguib [?] Ghali Pasha   - &apos; Agriculture.Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha -        - Justice.The Sultan and Adly Pasha.- On 18th March Lord Alleuby telegraphed [No. 180] -us follows :--A rescript dated 16th March has been addressed by the Sultan to Adly Pasha -calling on him, in view of His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision relative to the --abolition ot the protectorate and to the appointment by his Highness of an official -delegation, to form a new Cabinet to undertake the political action demanded by the present circumstances.In his reply, Adly Pasha indicates that the new Ministry will make an appeal to Saad Zaghloul and his associates to collaborate in arriving at an accord with Great Britain which will put out of doubt the independence of Egypt, and will inaugurate -a new era of friendship and mutual confidence. He mentions the necessity of any -accord reached, being submitted to a national assembly, freely elected and represeu-tative of the people, and expresses a pious hope that, with this end in view, it may be possible to suppress martial law and censorship. He states that though conscious that great reforms are needed, the Ministry will make no radical changes in anticipa-tion of the new parliamentary regime, but will administer the country in the best Interests of the people, keeping particularly in view the economic situation.GERMAN EAST AFRICA.Administration of certain Districts assumed. ReuteFs .agent telegraphed as follows from Dar-es-Salaam on 25th March:-On the 22nd instant, the British Government assumed the administration of the German administrative district of Ujiji and those portions of Tabora, Bukoba and Bismarckburg hitherto under Belgian administration. The final boundaries have not been defined. The same -currency has been adopted as in Tanganyika, but Belgian franc notes are accepted. Meanwhile, the exchange rate is five and a half francs to the florin or rupee. The handing over ceremony at Kigoma was attended by the administrator of&apos; Tanganyika Territory.INDIA.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xxxix, p. 3].-On 14th March the Viceroy reported .[36.1. S.] the receipt of a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, dated 12th.March, in which he said lie had proposed an official meeting for that date, but that Tarsi had asked him to explain the position first at a private meeting, which was to take place that -afternoon.   He announced an addition which he proposed to the draft in.case he found himself obliged to propound the whole of it.   This was an agreement to grant to the Afghan Government, on the ratification of the treaty, a sum of 31 lakhs, as -an additional token of the British Governments goodwill towards Afghanistan.  This amount represented the&apos;arrears of subsidy from the date of the signature of the Rawal Pindi treaty to the 12th February .1921.   Ills reasons were that such payment would bear the impress of being spontaneous rather than an admission of Afghan right to arrears, and would hasten ratification.
Sir Henry Vobbs sent a further telegram the.following day, transmitted [369 S.]&apos;-&quot;by the Viceroy on 15th March, giving an account of the private conversation with Tarsi. He had stated that the revelations regarding Bolshevik motives had convinced the British Government that their sole motive in making an agreement with Afghanistan was to create trouble in India. Therefore, without the certainty that the Bolshevik treaty contained nothing that would be injurious to them, the British Government would find it impossible to sign an agreement with Afghanistan. Notwithstanding the assurances of the Amir as to the fulfilment of the condition that he would, accept nothing harmful to us, there might be many provisions which Afghanistan might consider innocuous which wc might consider harmful. This made it imperative that we should see the Bolshevik draft treaty before signing our own; After some argument Sir Henry Dobbs agreed to hand Tarsi our draft agreement in its entirety on the-understanding that it must be amended to provide against anything contrary to our -interests in the Bolshevik agreement before it could be signed.Telegraphing [372 S.J on 15th March, the Viceroy referred to the telegram [1343] from the Secretary of State and subsequent-correspondence, and strongly urged that His Majesty&apos;s Government would reconsider  their attitude towards the Afghan problem.   This included insistence on the disclosure of the Bolshevik agreement;, stipulations against a subsidy or money grant; and against the gift of arms.   The first point had been met to a certain extent by the private negotiations with Tarsi,. but as regarded the other two, the Indian Government were emphatically of opinion that it would be inexpedient to make such stipulations, and that, if made, they would be powerless to enforce.   The determination of Afghanistan to assert her independence,..    i from which nothing short of war would drive her, made any attempt based, on politics . which were no longer practical, to secure a treaty, certain to be a failure.   This would be playing into the hands of the Bolsheviks, and would leave them an open field to-work their schemes against us, and, indeed, might lead, to war.   India, on -whom the brunt would fall, could not face an Afghan war.   In brief, then, India required the-good ncighbourliness of an united Afghanistan in order to stabilize her frontier, and. to provide a barrier against. Bolshevism.The Viceroy concluded, by quoting the success of the policy of keeping-Afghanistan out of the great war,&apos;and begged His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept the present policy of concluding a treaty with Afghanistan on the best terms that could be secured, standing finally on the prohibition of Bolshevik designs against ourselves.The Secretary of State acknowledged [1682] the receipt of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram on 22nd March.   He had awaited, the continuation of Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; telegram of -.13th March, as the next move-on the part of the Afghans would give a clearer-indication of their real attitude.    In the meantime he wished  to remove the-possibility of any misunderstanding.   Referring to the three points raised by the -Viceroy, as it was agreed the question of the disclosure of the Bolshevik agreement need not be re-opened at present, the Secretary of State only reiterated the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the disclosure was a necessary test of Afghan good faith.   On the questions of subsidy and supply of arms, he pointed out that the -Government had not said that the receipt of them, whatever the circumstances might be, would make a treaty impossible.   The questions must be considered in relation to--the whole situation.    But until the position at Kabul was clearer, he could not ask the Cabinet to reconsider the question.On 20th March the Viceroy transmitted [415 S.] a report sent by Sir Henry Dobbs on 13th March to the effect that he had authentic information that a preliminary treaty had been signed at Moscow between the Afghan and Anatolian Governments.: The draft of this treaty, together with that of the Bolshevik treaty, might be expected to reach Kabul about the end of April.Regarding Jamals schemes in Afghanistan, his representative in Moscow, Badrii Bey, had been told by the Soviet Government that some part of the assistance -proposed for Afghanistan would be given periodically, which was taken, to mean that in addition to the amount of arms and munitions named in the draft treaty, an annual fixed amount would be given.   The verbal assurances of the Bolsheviks, that they would not object to a treaty of neutrality between the British and the Afghans, on the understanding that Afghanistan would not be brought -under Bril isli influence,., had beeu repeated.   The Afghan delegation to Berlin had arrived at, Riga.   Baclri Bey had gone to Berlin to meet Muhammad Wali, the head of the legation there, And, lastly, that considerable impression was being made in Kabul by the information.
concerning Russian troubles which was being transmitted by -Afghan agents in Russia.The following day the Viceroy sent [416 S.] the contents of Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; telegram supplementary to the above. The latter reported that he had sent Nawab to interview Tarsi on the subject of the treaty with Anatolia, and had requested information on the.subject. Tarsi had admitted the possibility of such a.treaty, but had said that it could not be even considered until Kamafs representative, Abdur Rahman Beg, had arrived in Kabul. Tarsi had appeared impressed by the hint conveyed that the information concerning the Afghan delegation had been received from Berlin. He also revealed that Von Hentig, who was in Afghanistan during the war, and was now in the German Foreign Office, had written to him indicating the advantages of a treaty between Germany and Afghanistan. Tarsi had said that the * British draft treaty had been considered by the Afghans, who were preparing a draft treaty which would set&apos;forth their requirements,. The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following telegrams were sent on 17th and March :-I. (17th March).-Section 1. The United Provinces state that the general situation has to some extent deteriorated. No act of disorder has occurred, but the agitation is more intense, and the challenge to the Government is becoming more pronounced. Indications point to a period of difficulty in the hot weather when the crops are cut and the agricultural population enjoys a period of idleness before the rains. The result is a mass of combustible material ready to hand for the efforts of political incendiaries. The district executive authorities are taking action on the lines laid down by the local Government, ancl more uniform ancl co-ordinated efforts.are being made to counteract the non-co-operation movement. Reports show that the orders are welcomed by both officials and non-officials, but sufficient time has not yet elapsed to show the full effect of this&apos;policy.Section 2. A notorious local agitator and seven accomplices have been prosecuted, under section 143 of the Indian Penal Code, summarily, for preventing candidates from attending an examination at the Sanskrit College, Benares, ancl sentenced to short terms of imprisonment. The excise sales have been a complete failure- in three districts, and only a modified sirccess in some other places.Section 3. The caliphate conference early in the month attracted prominent agitators to Lucknow. The speeches made by Mohamed Ali and Shaukat Ali were very violent. The new Legislative Council is finding its feet. An early tendency to irresponsible prolixity is correcting itself, and there are signs that parties will come into existence with. (? settled) lines of intelligent and rational programmes.Section 4. A resolution in Council, advocating a mixed enquiry into the Rae Bareli disturbances, was lost. The district magistrate, Naini Tal, has issued orders under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, prohibiting all public meetings, except in places of worship, without written sanction from the authorities. The deputy commissioner of Aligarh has prohibited the holding of non-co-operation meetings within the municipal limits of Sikandra Rao.Section 5. Central Provinces. The Nagpur disturbances have been reported.; there has been no further trouble&apos;. - The non-co-operation campaign continues with unabated vigour, ancl the most disquieting feature is the continuous spread of the movement to the smaller towns ancl villages.Section 6. During a recent tour of the commissioner of Berar to a typical town in the interior; there was a hartal in consequence of his arrival. Arbitration courts have been set up ancl national schools opened. Collections of cotton are made from each cart entering the market, to provide funds for the so-called national work. The political leaders have employed a number of volunteers to enforce their orders in. the towns ancl neighbouring villages. The commissioner took vigorous action to deal with the situation.Section 7. The temperance campaign has intensified. The formation of volunteer organizations is spreading.   Arbitration courts have started at several places.Section 8. Punjab. The home member visited Lahore on the 6th March, and discussed with the Punjab Government the measures to be taken in regard to the Nankana affair. The Punjab Government subsequently announced that they con-templated legislation on the lines of the Charity Commissioners in England, and a Press telegram of the 15th instant.states that, the resolution regarding the introduction 26-5 B
of such legislation and its promulgation, as a temporary measure or ordinance, was carried on a motion made by the Education Minister, Eazli Hussain, by 30 votes, to 1, the Sikh members abstaining. The exact form of the resolution has not yet been reported.Section 9. In the meantime the local Government has instructed the district magistrates that if a dispute exists regarding any (? shrine), action should be taken under section. 145 (4), second proviso. Troops are being moved to Anandpur and Mnktsar with a view to the prevention of possible disturbances.Section 10. Meetings have been held at Lahore between certain leading Sikhs, two members of tbe Executive Council, ministers and the commissioner and deputy . commissioner, at which the following conclusions were reached : (1) As to property -belonging to the shrine, the committee appointed by the commissioner to manage the shrine is to remain in adverse possession. AVhether it is actually in possession, and how far such possession is lawful, are matters for the decision of the courts of law. (2) Persons interested are at liberty to go to the courts, criminal or civil, and the Government is not to take possession, or oust the committee from possession, until the courts pass orders. (.3) As to the shrine itself, the Government are prepared to protect it against attack. Jathas in Nankana or in neighbourhood to be removed within five days; and tbe committee and all concerned are to use all their influence to prevent any other organized armed bodies from coming to Nankana or to any of the villages in which a shrine is situated. Subsequently, the Keara shrine at Nankana was seized by Kartar Singh, a member of the committee, at the head of a band of. armed men. The commissioner proceeded to Nankana. Kartar Singh and 10 others were arrested, and the shrine attached by tbe district magistrate. The disarmament of armed Sikhs at Nankana is stated to be proceeding quietly. A communique issued on the 12th states that a small shrine in Lahore was entered by an armed band, who subjected Mahant to a form of penance. The shrine was attached by the district magistrate; but the order of attachment was disregarded on the removal of the police. Subsequently, the shrine was taken over by the police and a number of persons were arrested. The circulation of the vernacular papers Bandc Nalaram and Prcdap is said to have increased enormously. Gandhi and his party, on tour, tried to impress upon the Sikhs that the British Government was to blame for the loss of lives. Gandhi has issued an open letter to the Sikhs, advising them not to seek redress for crimes in the courts of law, which are established by the Civil Government he especially deprecates; and stated that there are two alternatives, either the establishment of arbitration courts for the settlement of disputes regarding the possession of all shrines or the postponement of the question till the attainment of swaraj.Section 11, There are no signs that the Sikhs will be willing to forego punish-ment of Mohant and his followers, but the uon-co-operationists are urging that there should be another prosecution of Government officials for conspiracy, and their propaganda is not without effect on the feeling amongst the Sikhs, wdio are still in a highly excited condition.Section 11a. Bihar and Orissa.-A few policemen are reported to have gone on strike in two districts. Generally, a lull is reported in the non-co-operation campaign, but in some districts the movement is active. There was complete hartal when the Governor visited Monghyr. In. Chota Nagpur the movement is losing strength in spite of violent speeches, -Proceedings have been taken in a good many cases in the province under sections 108 anil 144 of tbe Criminal Procedure Code. It is reported unofficially that  agrarian unrest is developing in the district north of the Ganges.Section 12. Madras. In the hartal on 27th February, reported last week, nothing untoward occurred. The temperance movement has now appeared in most districts of the presidency except in the extreme south.Section 13. The sale of Arrack in shops has been boycotted in many places, and the decrease in the excise revenue is likely to be&quot;considerable. Opinion is divided as to whether this is entirely a political movement. There is no doubt that it has the active support of many who are not non-co-operators. The boycott of schools has made no headway.   The non-co-operation movement has extended to Coorg.Section .1-1.   Bombay.-Students are returning in small numbers to the schools in Bombay.   The mofia-ssil situation continues temporarily to fluctuate in any locality , where a national school is opened.   The labour situation is easier.
Section 15. General.-The general situation has not apparently.altered since our last telegram, but we are now approaching the most critical months of the year when, if ever, non-co-operationists may be expected to put forth all their efforts to bring about widespread disturbances, It is impossible to forecast the measure of success which these efforts are likely to attain, more particularly in the Punjab and the United Provinces, where the elements of danger are the greatest. At the same time there is no sufficient reason at present to assume that the disturbances, if they occur,, will be on such a scale and so well co-ordinated as to make the task of dealing with them extremely difficult, nor do we coulemplate at present any general change of the policy hitherto pursued. The local Governments are now taking more vigorous action under the ordinary law, and, in particular, are using section 114 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for the prevention, of meetings likely to influence feeling amongst the masses; and the loud protests of extremists indicate that the action of the authorities is hampering their seditious activities. The situation, however, is liable to change with great rapidity, and cannot therefore be forecasted with any confidence.The Turkish Peace. The following telegrams were sent by the Viceroy on 12th and 14th March respectively : (I.) The following resolution was moved by Sir Zulfiqar Ali Khan in the Council of State on 3rd March :  &quot; This Council recommends to the Governor-General in Council that he will be pleased to address the Secretary of State for India with the object of securing that full consideration is given to public opinion in this country before any matter is decided in which the religious susceptibilities of any class of His Majesty&apos;s subjects in India are concerned.&quot;An amendment to the above was moved by Saiyid Raza Ali, wdio suggested that the words &quot;by His Majesty s Government&quot; on the caliphate question, be substituted for the words beginning, &quot; Before any matter,&quot; to the end. Raza Ali said that the resolution, as thus amended, would embody the Indian point of view, especially of the moslems, in a better form perhaps than Zulfiqar Ali&apos;s, and gratefully acknowledged the sympathy extended to mohamedan feeling, both by his countrymen, and by the European community in India, official and non-official. He had no quarrel with &apos;the Government of India, his criticisms were directed against the Homo Department of the Government, of India. He had laid the views .of the Indian moslems before Parliament, but had completely failed to influence its policy. The Cabinet&apos;s failure adequately to appreciate moslem sentiment he attributed to the non-inclusion of a Moslem representative in London.2. The Conferences of 1917 and 1918, having regard to the momentous issues at stake, and to the religious nature of the problems involved, maintained that it was the plain duty of the Government of India and the Home Government to have insisted on a moslem representative at those meetings. This error was responsible for the prevailing discontent among mohamedans. The Cabinet had also all along treated Indian moslem sentiment in a manner that was bound to create unrest. He welcomed the despatch of a mohamedan deputation to England, including i wo Sunnis. He felt that some regard should be paid to the unanimous demands of moslems, as with the cases of citizens of a self-governing Dominion. The Foreign Secretary doubted the wisdom of the mover&apos;s tactics, and thought that there was no need to discuss a topic on which the House had already passed its full opinion during the debate on the Bhurgris resolution, held on 21st February. Zulfiqar Ali Khan still thought; his resolution justified. A member said that it would be a work of superero-gation to ask yon now to secure that full consideration should be given to public opinion in India, but they were prepared to send you a copy of the debate, and an abstract of it by telegram. With this undertaking, the resolution and the amendment was withdrawn. We regret the delay in cabling the summary. It has been due to the late receipt of the Council proceedings. Even now we have only a proof before us.(II.) I have received a long letter from the Begum of Bhopal on the stibject of the Turkish peace terms. &quot; After dwelling on the unsatisfactory features of the treaty of Sevres, she says that it has wrought terrible mischief by creating two wide-spread impressions, (1) that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in contrast to the Govern merit of India, are absolutely hostile to Tnrkey&apos;s cause, and (2) that the view of the Govern-ment of India, and consequently the opinion of India itself, does not carry, in imperial councils, the weight to which it is entitled. The removal of these impressions, which are responsible for all agitation, will tend to restore normal conditions. After quoting 25-5 &apos; C
His/Royal Highness&apos;s farewell words,&quot;beginning &apos; the voice of India lias not carried the weight, and does not carry the weight, which India has a right to claim. To my mind, the outstanding merit of lndia&apos;s new constitution is, that the view of the Government of India must henceforth weigh more heavily in the scale, as more truly &quot;representing the Indian point, of. view, than it has done in the past.&apos; Her Highness pleads for a stroke of bold imaginative statesmanship in favour of Turkey&apos;s cause. Only by giving unmistakable proof of his Majesty&apos;s Governments regard for the unanimous wish of, the teeming millions of India, can the impression of British hostility to aboriginal countries be removed. Reuter. has emphasized the desire of France for revision, and consequently moslems regard His Majesty&apos;s Government as the only obstacle. This is extremely unfortunate, in view of the situation in Egypt, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Persia and Afghanistan. The world situation is so very abnormal that it calls for exceedingly bold statesmanship in the British Empire, and matters have reached such a stage in this country that it is important, to deal with the caliphate question in consonance with the wishes of the moslem community. Great Britain&apos;s reputation has always stood high for devotion to moslem interests, and a notable proof of her&apos; steadfastuess at this difficult time cannot fail to strike the imagination and capture the hearts of the Islamic world.&quot;THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.,Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been communicated by the department of External Affairs :  (1) The- Canadian Government Merchant Marine, Limited, is opening a service between Vancouver and Montreal. Thirty freight steamers will be operated to various points during the coming summer from the port of Montreal.(2) An Order in Council has been passed extending indefinitely the time during which immigrants of the mechanic, artisan, or labourer classes, skilled or unskilled, are required to possess $250 on landing in Canada, in addition to a ticket to destination. This does not apply to farmers and household workers, or wives or minor children of persons legally resident in Canada.&quot;&quot; AUSTRALIA.Reparation : Sanction B. The following telegram from the Prime Minister of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies was received on 18th March: It would appear that the assumption upon which the approval of the Common-wealth Government was based as set out in my telegram of 7th March, that the 50 per cent, collected would be paid into a pool to be distributed among the allies in proportions agreed to&apos;inter se, was unfounded and that it is intended that.each allied nation shall retain all moneys collected in this way for its own use. The Common-wealth Government is of opinion that, the principle is wrong and that its application is certainly calculated to prejudice Australian interests, I have explained already that the Commonwealth policy prohibits German imports; but, apart from this, a large proportion of German goods coming into Australia before the war were re-exported to Australia from Britain. It is gathered from your telegram that moneys collected in respect of these would be retained by Britain. And as, in any case, the. amount of money collected under&apos;sanction B would depend upon the volume of German imports, and as these must necessarily displace Australian goods or goods from other countries mainly from Britain--the Commonwealth Government cannot approve it.-Fruit.-Oa 19th March the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : My Prime Minister informs me that the position of the fruit export trade from Australia, particularly Western Australia, is in a very critical state, aud that great, loss will result unless immediate action be taken to facilitate exportation. In Western Australia alone there are 100,000.cases ready for packing for export and S0,000 cases in cool stores A7essels arriving before the 3rd April cau accommodate 30,000 cases only.   The provision of space towards the end of April will not help
materially. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be glad if -arrangements could be made for additional space to be made available for fruit. Urgent consideration and a reply as soon as possible would be appreciated.In reply to this telegram the Secretary of State sent the following message on .28th March:-    .The Food Controller states that the Sydney Overseas Shipping Committee was instructed to provide for the carriage of exportable Australian fruit, in consultation -with&apos;the shippers, in various states up to the maximum of ],2f)0,000 cases, and that provision was actually allocated by the Committee for 108,000 cases. In the case of Western Australia provision was made for 190,000 cases, of which .125,000 were from Fremantle and 65,000 from Albany. Unfortunately the Northumberland, allocated to carry 65,000 cases from Albany, was delayed in New Zealand, but instructions have been sent to the Sydney Committee to do everything possible to expedite Western Australian shipments. The Food Controller regrets it is impracticable to rearrange the programme from this end.&quot;NEW ZEALAND. .Parliament.-On 24th March the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that Parliament had been prorogued, that clay.SOUTH AFRICA. .German&apos; Reparation. On 17th March the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that he had been requested by General Smuts to inform him that his Ministers did not propose to &quot;introduce legislation in regard to sanction B. The Prime Minister had added that they had given their -most careful&apos; Consideration to the scheme, but found it impossible to agree to it as being in the interests of either the Empire as a whole or the Union.Wool [B.E.R., xxxviii, p. 13]. On 22nd March the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General.: The offer in my telegram of 19th January was made on the assumption that the --amounts of the various qualities- of which particulars were given by Messrs. Reynolds and Chapped were contained in the 100,000 bales (approximately) to be purchased. These were based on the telegram from your Palme Minister to the High Commissioner -of 30th November.It is assumed that the assortment of qualities, now remaining, does not differ too widely from the particulars given previously, i.e., that the proportion of short natives -coarse and coloured has not been greatly increased, and the proportion of combing wool has not been correspondingly diminished.On this understanding His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to their offer in spite of the 20 per cent, fall in market prices of wool since my telegram of 19th January. Clean scoured prices for coarse ancl coloured should not exceed twice those in - grease. The Ministry of Munitions desire to know -what the Union Government consider a reasonable charge for scouring. Wool already shipped is not included in the offer. The wool of season 19.19-20 means wool shorn between 1st August 1919 and 1st August 1920. An inclusive charge must be fixed to cover handling, appraisement, insurance and storage, which should not exceed -f-cZ. per lb. Expenses of this character in Australia have, been less than hd. per lb. We regret that it is quite impossible to -contemplate extending the purchase to the wool clip of the current- season or to mohair. It is suggested that holders of last seasoiPs wool should register their clips within a short term, not exceeding ] 5.clays, and that the Union Government should retain the option of refusing or accepting according to the quantities registered of the various qualities. This precaution is necessary because the 1913-14 schedule is far above the present value of the lower qualities of wool, most of which are at present virtually unsaleable in England. As to -the staff and advisory committees, we agree to your proposals. All.other arrangements would be agreed in detail between your wool committee and the Director of Raw Materials; but until the main conditions are -accepted it is premature to consider such details. Unless the Union Government see their way to arrange first-rate storage, available for 12 months, it is useless proceeding further with the business. The European wool market is so bad that a long period of storage is essential, otherwise a hurried resale might result in ruinous losses.
