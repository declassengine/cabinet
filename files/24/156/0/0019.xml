The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 2nd June 1920 :  The General Labour Situation. Attention may be drawn to two features in the situation at the end of thft week. The strike of steam service men employed in the Sheffield trade, members of the National Union of Enginemen, &amp;c, is a good illustra-tion of the difficulties caused by different unions catering for the same classes of workers; and the movement throughout the country for increased wages for the employees of co-operative societies.With regard to the more general situation more particularly the whole problem of the cost of living, and the attitude of the trade union movement to Ireland and Poland very little development has taken place since last week, but the resumption of the parliamentary session which may mean discussions on the Unemployment Insurance Bill and the Hours of Employment Bill, the Rent Restrictions Bill ancl other Bills affecting Labour, together, with the near approach of the annual conference of the Labour Party, promise important developments in the near future.Labour and Russia. The hesitation of the N.U.R; Executive in dealing with the conveyance of military stores to Ireland may be contrasted with the instruction which has been issued by authority of the same body to members of the N.U.R. to refuse to handle any material intended to assist Poland against the Russian people. The questions of Irish and Russian self-determination are closely connected with each other in the mind of British Trade Unionism, and this difference in action, towards the two matters on the part of the N.U.R. Executive must not be taken to represent any fundamental difference of policy on the two-questions. This difference in action results from the obvious facts that the amounts of munitions of war proceeding to Poland from this country are strictly limited, and refusals to deal with them will not lead to any serious practical consequences on foreign trade: while similar conduct with regard to Ireland would not only lead to an interruption in goods traffic with Ireland, but would bring about a direct conflict between the trade union movement ancl the Government. Apart from this decision of the N.U.R. Executive, the action taken with regard to Polish munitions has been limited in extent and entirely unofficial in character. This unofficial action, however, has met with enthusiastic approval at the conferences of trade unions recently held, and from these resolutions it may be judged that the whole of the transport workers will support action taken by any of their members in this matter.The Cost of Living.--Th.ere is nothing further to report with regard to the setting-up of a special committee of inquiry, representative of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party ancl the co-operative movement to consider the cause of high prices, and to discuss ways ancl means of bringing down the cost of living. It may be noted that &quot;the Independent Labour Party is to hold a special national conference to formulate proposals on this question on 12th June. Resolutions adopted by the Executive Committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters ancl Joiners may be taken as giving some guide as to the policy which will be propounded on behalf of Labour. The resolutions call for a levy on wealth, the abandonment of all militarist ancl imperialistic schemes, ancl the drastic reduction of expenditure on armaments, the acquisition for the community of labour, railways, coal mines and shipping, and the immediate revision of the peace treaty. Such proposals as these, together with the scheme adopted by the. miuers last December for a continuance of subsidies on articfes of necessity and a reduction of taxation upon articles of food, may therefore well be taken as the basis of the specific proposals to be put forward.International Labour Conference. The International Labour Conference is to hold its second session at Genoa on the 15th June. The agenda of this Conference was given in this Report, 19th May, p. 234. The Conference will have before it the result of investigations already made by the International Labour Office and a programme drawn up at Antwerp last year at the International Seamen&apos;s Conference. Delegates are actually expected at the Conference from the following 23 countries :--Great Britain,  Australia,   Belgium,   Canada, China,   Czecho-Slovakia,  Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Siam, Spain, Sweden and Venezuela, The delegation of Great Britain,.including technical advisers and staff, will number about 22. The British official delegates will be: Sir Montague Barlow, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, and Mr. Hipwood, Assistant Secretary, Marine Department of the Board of Trade. The British employers&apos; delegate will be Sir Alfred Booth, of the Cunard Steamship Company, and Mr. Havelock Wilson, M. P., Merchant Seamen&apos;s League, will represent British seamen. It is reported that the questionnaire sent out hy the International Labour Office has beeu answered by 14 States ; an important statement from New Zealand has been received on the operation of the 8-hour clay for seamen which may serve as.a guide for some of the difficulties. Before the Conference an unofficial meeting of international seamen&apos;s unions will be held in the same place, and there is a possibility that the American representative, Mr. E. T. H. Feruseth, will attend the Conference. Although America cannot attend this Conference officially, on account of the non-ratification of the Peace Treaty, the Conference has complete power to arrange for the representation of American labour or maritime employers if the Americans wish it.International Federation of Trade Unions. The Bureau of the International Federation of Trade Unions meeting in London on the 11th ultimo, decided to take steps towards putting into effect the resolution to boycott Hungary passed in March last. The official statement announces that information has been received showing that the present Hungarian Government has been vindictively persecuting Com-munists and conniving at the unofficial murder of men who did not belong to the dominant race or who were suspected of holding opposing political views. The signatories to the communication are Messrs. AV. A. Appleton, President; L. Jouhaux and C. Mertens, Vice-Presidents ; and J. Oudegeest and E. Fimmen, Secretaries. A circular letter has now been issued to all national centres to call the international boycott. It is expected that a definite date for the beginning of the boycott will be fixed next week.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Prime Ministers Conditions. On 27th May, Lord Allenby reported [No. 516] that Nessim Pasha, on taking office, had asked for an assurance that no question touching the political status of Egypt should be decided before the settlement of that status. He said that the Prime Minister at the time of their conversation had the question of the judicature law and the capitulations in his mind; but the actual effect of the assurance was that until the political status of the country had been decided he should not ask the Ministry to deal with labour legislation, the Air, Liquor, and Arms Traffic Conventions, or questions of nationality in addition to the two matters mentioned above.EAST AFRICA.British and Belgians. ReuteFs agency is informed that M. cle la Bascompierre of the Belgian. Foreign Office, and M. Louwers of the Belgian Colonial Department, are in London conducting negotiations with Lord Milner in regard to the ex-German territory in East Africa, now known as the Tanganyika territory. It has been arranged that the former German provinces of Ruanda and Urundi shall come under the Belgian mandate. But there are certain transit problems in connexion with the ex-German territory still to be settled ; among them the arrangements for transport along that section of the former German railway between Tabora and the coast at Dar-es-Salaam, now in British territory.
INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xviii., p. 4].-The Viceroy telegraphed [693] on 5th June that he had received a message from Mr. Dobbs saying that Tarsi had -written to him agreeing without further demur to resume conversations on 7th June.Telegraphing on 6th June [697 S.], the Viceroy gave a brief summary of the correspondence which had passed between Mr. Dobbs and Tarsi on the subject of the Afghan request for cessation of operations in Waziristan during conversations. Mr. Dobbs wrote - to Tarsi on 23rd May saying that he was ready to resume conversations as the Afghan forces had been withdrawn from Tandisar and Lambabat. Tarsi replied the following day by a request for a definite promise that Waziristan operations should cease, Mr. Dobbs answered that he could not believe that the inability of the British Government to accede to this request would force the delegation to, abandon conversations, and pointed out that British troops had not in fact recently taken part in operations in Waziristan. In any case, however, he could not bind the British Government not to undertake further operations,.should they be found necessary. He was prepared to reply to enquiries about the British frontier policy generally and Waziristan in particular. On 31st May Tarsi sent a long letter in reply, which concluded as follows:  &quot; I infer that on the part of Wazir tribe nothing in the nature of collective attacks and. general fighting occurred (? and that) your Government will in future also suspend military operations during our discussions. In conclusion, you have said that you will be glad to answer in the course of our discussions enquiries which I may wish to make regarding British frontier policy. I, too, will certainly be very glad and thankful to hear just intentions of your Government regarding the various Afghan frontier tribesmen who have always been cause of trouble to British Govern-ment and of disturbing their friendly relations with Afghan Government. As matter has been satisfactorily settled, members of my delegation are Avith great pleasure ready to come for official discussions on any day and at any time which may be fixed by you.&quot;Mr. Dobbs replied to this on 2nd June expressing his satisfaction at the decision to wdiich Tarsi had come, and added : &quot; You will, of course, understand that I have not given, and cannot give, any undertaking regarding operations in Waziristan.&quot;The Viceroy&apos;a Weekly Reports,-The following reports were sent .on 20th and 28th May respectively : I. (20th May). 1. We telegraphed yesterday His Excellency&apos;s message to the Moslems of India and a summary of our explanatory statement on the terms. It is still too early to say what line the Caliphate agitators will take; but no information .of any disturbances has been received up to now. A Bombay telegram, repeated to you yesterday, shows that they have matured their plans and have formed a sub-committee to work out details. Chotaui, who has hitherto belonged to the more moderate faction, has now joined the extremists, having apparently been persuaded to that, course by Mushir Husain Qidwai, who has been making attempts to put more vitality into the Central Caliphate Committee, as may be inferred from the following-summary of a letter from him to Chotani: (i) He threatens secession from the Central Caliphate Committee if there shouldbe any watering clown of the policy of non-co-operation, and complains of hesitation and timidity on the part of that body.(ii) He emphasizes the necessity of calling a conference of the chief leaders atplaces like Delhi and Lucknow with a view to securing eleventh-hour concessions.(iii) The strongest possible efforts must be made to prove to the Governmentthat Indian Mohamedans mean business. The time is not ripe for putting into practice the decision to withhold co-operation, but fiery resolutions are needed to keep the pot boiling, and preparations for the threatened action must be accelerated.   No violence must take place at this stage.(iv) If possible, the Aga Khan must be prevailed upon to lead a deputation toEngland.(v) For the next 10 or 15 days it is essential that the leaders (Chotani, Abdul Bari. Shaukat Ali, Abul Kalam, flasrat Mohani and Qidwai) should meet and remain in personal conclave as close as possible to the Aga Khan.
2. The Bombay Government in view of this are now considering their general line of action, but will of course consult the Government of India before any definite policy is adopted. The Central Committee is by no means unanimous : Mr. Badruddin Abdullah Koojal is understood to have resigned the joint secretaryship. Interviewed by the Advocate of India he said that when he joined the Caliphate Committee he understood that its programme would be carried out on strictly constitutional lines, but the Committee had passed resolutions calling on Moslem employees in civil and military circles to resign their posts as protests ; the Committee would be responsible for bringing sorrow and misery into the homes of happy Mohamedan families : those who made suggestions of this nature were idiots.3. There has been suppressed excitement during the last fortnight, which has been marked by fewer meetings ; though even on the 14th very violent speeches were delivered at a conference at Agra, when it was resolved to try and raise funds to enable Mohamedans in the Government service to resign their posts as a protest. The extremist leaders seem to desire to pause awhile before embarking on a more violent agitation on the announcement of the peace terms. An- interesting indication of this comes from Delhi, where Shaukat Ali made a flying visit and roundly abused the extremist agitators for premature activities which had afforded the Government an opening for a counter-stroke in the shape of a proclamation of Delhi under the Seditious Meetings Act by which, as late reports from Delhi show, the more restrained elements of the public have been frankly gratified. The Turkish cpiestion continues to be keenly discussed, and the writings in not a few Mohamedan newspapers are conceived in a most objectionable vein. The Zemindar published a communicated article, the writer of which contended that Mohamedans owed loyalty only to rulers professing Islam. It also published a poem urging them to unsheath their swords for a Jehad. The migration, question is claiming increasing attention, and the Government is being asked to place no,obstacle in the way of intending emigrants. The enforcement in Delhi of the Seditious Meetings Act in connexion with the Caliphate agitation has been criticized by several papers, both Hindu and Mohamedan.4. Mahmud Tarsbs Mussoorie speech has been applauded in the Moslem Press, some of which have also reprinted pro-Turkish articles from the Afghan papers, Aman-i-Afghanistah and Ittih.ad-i-Mashriki. Interception of correspondence between a Mohamedan lance-daik in Mesopotamia and the president of the Central Caliphate Committee indicates that the former has been in communication with the latter to obtain Caliphate literature to help the collection of funds among the Mohamedan troops in Mesopotamia. Another intercepted letter from a military employe in Baghdad suggests that he is engaged in propaganda among the troops with the connivance of Shaukat Ali.5. An informal gathering of Sardars Matahis (PMaulvis) and leading citizens of Quetta was summoned by the agent of the Governor-General of Baluchistan, who explained the present situation and referred to the claims alleged, to have been made that the Amir of Afghanistan should be regarded as the Caliph. &apos; The speech made a very good impression; and the Khan of Khelat and many other Sardars and representatives of tribes and. communities in Baluchistan assured the agent of their continued loyalty and offered their services and the services of their tribes and communities whenever required by the Government. The Chief OonnuissioneF-of the North-West Frontier Province addressed a similar audience at Kohat and explained the situation vis-a-vis Afghanistan ; similar expressions of continued loyalty were manifested.6. At present we are waiting to see the effect of the announcement of the Turkish peace terms on Moslems and the measure of their response to His Excellency&apos;s message. For the moment we can only observe our present attitude of vigilance and preparedness at any moment to deal with the leader of the movement, should serious trouble arise. Gandhi&apos;s manifesto on the peace terms we have already telegraphed to you. So far, we have had but little indication of their reception either by the people or in the Press, but the Bombay Chronicle says that a more ruthless scheme for the effacement of the Ottoman Empire could not have been devised. Turkey has been made into a thing of shreds and patches, and all chances of a revived Moslem civilization under the Sultan-Caliph seem to have been destroyed. No words of barren comfort will reconcile Moslems to a treaty which reduces the Caliph to impotent Princeship and deprives him of the wardenship of the Holy Places and Jazi-rat-ul-Arab. Moslems cannot accept the decision as final. While counselling patience, the paper characterizes the memorandum of the Government of India on the treaty as puff. The Amrita Bazar Oujka says that Turkey has no strength left and 17-2 B
therefore has nothing to hope for. But it expects a great result from the fall of Turkey : out of her ashes will rise a greater, a stronger Asia, able to check her people and her liberty against external aggression, and Turkey will not only then be a pillar of the Islamic faith, but the seed of Asiatic greatness. We expect to see indications of the plans of the sub-committee referred to above, and of the reception of the peace terms and the effect of&quot; His Excellency&apos;s message very shortly, and will keep you informed of the developments of the situation.7. The strike at Lahore continues. Employees of the railway have not yet returned to work and have been joined by certain sections of the [rathe branch. &apos; A great reduction of the train services has resulted, and consequent inconvenience to the general public, whose attitude, however, is said to be favourable to the strikers. The behaviour of the strikers throughout has been good ; though one instance of attempted assault on one of the men still working has been reported. The strikers rely largely on Miller, who has them well under control and is said to be against importing politics into the strike. At the same time Lajpat Rai has keenly interested himself and has been taking an active part in the negotiations. The Lieutenant-Governor&apos;s intervention has been suggested by Satyapal and another municipal commissioner of Amritsar. The strike is receiving the direct attention of the Punjab Government. The Chamber of Commerce has visited Lahore to confer with the agent ancl the strike representatives, but so far work has not been resumed.II. (28th May).--1. The announcement of the Turkish peace terms has so far been quietly received. There have, of course, been violent articles in the extremist Press, but the United Provinces paper, Independent, in its issue of I9th May, had an appreciative article on the Viceroy&apos;s message, and, though it regarded the break up of the Turkish Empire as a calamity, it supported his appeal to Moslems to bear their present trials with patience. Messages from the extremists indicate their intention to try and translate their policy into action. The following telegram, addressed by Abdul Bari ancl Mushir Husaiu Kidwai to the Mohamedans of India, is a brief index of their attitude :-The Turkish peace terms are outrageous. The situation is desperate. Mussulmans should be patient until the Ulemas and the Central Caliphate Committee decide on action.Shaukat Ali, in a similar message, has. begged the Moslems to brace themselves for a life-long struggle, to eschew hasty or violent action,, and to organize a non-co-operation movement, working strenuously with Gandhi and the Hindu leaders. Some resignations have also taken place as a protest; for example, the Honourable Mr. Bhugri has resigned his seat as a member of the Bombay Legislative Council, and Mr. Yaknb Husain has written &quot;to Lord Willingclon a violent letter resigning his membership of the Madras Council, the Corporation and Port Trust, and the Reception Gommittee for the Prince of Wales.2. In general, however, the news has been received quietly. There have been no disturbances, and a firman issued by the Nizam of Hyderabad on the 23rd May will probably have a sobering effect on the more excitable element. The purport of the firman is as follows : The public of Hyderabad and Mohamedans generally may not be aware of the strong representations I made to His Excellency the Viceroy in favour of recognizing the religious sentiments of Mqhamedans and fulfilling pledges. During the war the situation was acute, and those representations could not be made publicly. With &quot;His Excellency the Viceroy I fully share the regrets expressed in his message in this our hour of trial, ancl feel the decision includes terms painful to all Moslems. Any further agitation, however, in my dominions over the Caliphate question will be of &quot;no avail: it may create unrest prejudicial to the best interests of my subjects. 1 therefore now prohibit the holding of such meetings in my dominions, and exhort my people to abstain from participating in a movement that, may develop dangerous proportions. Whoever takes any action in contravention of the orders now passed will be held responsible for the same.3. Reports from all the provinces show a decreasing interest in the Caliphate agitation. The opinion that non-co-operation is unworkable is gaining ground. Papers like the Independent have pointed out its risks, and Shastri has written in the Madras Citizen questioning the policy. In Bengal the supremacy of the critical faculty, even among the more advanced, is asserting itself, and the question is asked what particular practical step it is a duty to take. In a telegram to the president of the Central Caliphate Committee resigning his membership Mr. Bhugri has stated his emphatic view that the non-co-operation policy is suicidal to the interests of Moslems nnd of the country, and he was unable to associate himself with it.
This message, though somewhat inconsistent with his resignation of the Bombay Legislative Council, is significant of the growing opposition to the non-co-operation propaganda. On the other hand, an unpleasant form of non-co-operation has been put forward at an extremist conference in Fyzabad, where a resolution was passed to the effect that it was impossible for Indian Moslems to accord a hearty welcome to the -Prince of Wales. Speakers held out a warning that Hartal would be arranged at every place visited by the Prince. But there is no reason to believe that-this feeling-is-shared by any but the irreconcilable element, or that it will persist after the Turkish settlement becomes final. In spite of pressure, few titles have been resigned. The possibility of Hijrat is accepted by very&apos; few, though- the North-West Frontier Province reports some infinitesimal signs of its development. An account appeared in the Punjab Zamindar giving details of an extensive Hijrat organization at Madras, but this appears to be a hoax : the facts were that about twenty &quot; emigrants &quot; left Marxian with a caravan, but nearly half of them returned. The article has had the beneficial effect of calling a further public protest from some of the leading men of the district, The political unity of Hindus and Moslems is likely to be put to a severe test at the coming Bakr-id, in some quarters especially of Bihar and Orissa, on account of the differences regarding cow-sacrifice. The Amritsar compact is not likely to be accepted by the rank aud file of Mohamedans, and Abdul Bari has accepted a series of written statements on the subject; that cow-sacrifice is enjoined by religion and that Hindus should not take exception to it during Bakr-id, but that the sacrifice should be made in such a manner as not to give offence to or hurt the feelings of Hindus.4. The policy of non-intervention arid action under ordinary law when necessary -has been maintained. Madras has decided to take no action against Shaukat Ali. In the Punjab the permission given to the Lieutenant-Governor to proclaim certain areas under the Seditions Meetings Act has not been used ; but a warning has been issued that unless violent language was restrained he would be compelled to have recourse to action under the Act. His communique- on. the subject has been well received by the Indian Press. In the case of Stud, very violent language was used at the Jacobabad conference on 2nd and. 3rd May ; and since then the Maulvis have openly preached in the mosques lies about -pretended British atrocities in Mecca, Medina, and other holy cities of Islam. The Bombay Government requested us to vest the Commissioner of Sind with powers under the Defence of India Consolidation Rules with a view to speedy action being taken in clear cases. We have told. Bombay we prefer prosecution under the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Penal Code; but recognizing that this alternative may not meet the requirements of the situation in Sind, which appears to be an especial danger point, we have empowered the Commissioner to act, under the Defence of India Rules. Action taken under it will, however, be judicial and not executive. The United Provinces reports that two prosecutions under the Code of Criminal Procedure have had excellent effect.5. The association of the Amir of Afghanistan with the Caliphate has led the president of the Afghan delegation to send the following message!) the Press: -Since the Allahabad Pioneer has recently published . some articles which may probably cause misunderstanding among the public about the case of the Caliphate, staling that His Imperial Majesty Amir Amanullah Khan Al-Ghazi-ul-Islam, King of Afghanistan (may his Kingdom last for ever), also claims to be a Caliph of Islam, it is to be openly contradicted that such rumours are fanatical, misleading, and unfounded, and articles mean nothing but to sow seeds of dissension and disunion in the Moslem world.In connexion with the Afghan delegation an. order has been issued by the United Provinces Government forbidding Pandet Jawahir Lai Nehru, suspected of intriguing with the members of the delegation at Mussoorie, to enter, reside or remain in any area within the limits of the district of Dehra Dun.6. In the above appreciation of the Caliphate agitation, we do not leave out of consideration the possibility of a movement below the calm surface. It may be that a later date coinciding with the Turkish reply to the peace terms has been adopted-ior overt demonstrations, but evidences of such arrangement are practically nil. It might on the contrary have been anticipated that the period between the aunouacement of the terms and the date fixed for the Turkish reply would haye been seized upon for violent demonstrations. The fact appears to be that even extremist Moharnedans are-reluctant to translate words into deeds. Each looks for a lead from his neighbour, and that lead is not given.   A curious illustration of this was the case of Mazhir-ul-
Haque (Bihar), who was selected to do an act which would have involved executive action by the Local Government: he merely counselled intensive agitation for six months&apos;.7. Apart from the cleavage between the moderates and the extremists on the Caliphate question of non-co-operation, the extremists are showiug themselves capable electioneers for the forthcoming election campaign, in the direction of rousing tenant against landlord; the organization known as &quot; Kisau sabha&quot; is now at work on these lines both in the United Provinces and in Bihar and Orissa. It is interesting to note also that there are signs of a rapprochement between Gandhi and Tilak through the medium of Kelkar. Tilak is anxious for Gandhi&apos;s help in securing the adherence, of Mohamedans to one or other of the Home Rule Leagues, and ior both of these with Baptista and Khaparde to tour India after the Indian Home Rule League Conference with the object of collecting funds for propaganda abroad. Nothing is settled, but it seems likely that Gandhi will try and wrest from Tilak active support in the non-co-operation movement as the price of his assistance.8. There has been little change during the week in regard to the railway strike at Lahore. Efforts have been made to induce men in out stations to join the movement by Miller and his associates, but they have not met with much success. The leaders are doing all they can to maintain the strike and secure recognition of the Union; but though the men for the moment remain out, their enthusiasm is waning and their funds are running low.Miller visited Amritsar, where he was received as an extremist political leader, but respectable people even of the middle-class were conspicuous by their absence from the meeting which he addressed. He also visited Rawalpindi and brought out some of the railway staff. The Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province has just asked to be allowed.to take action against (?group omitted) under the Defence of India Rules to prevent his intended visit to Peshawar with the object of extending the scope of the strike on the ground that the visit would be highly dangerous at the present juncture. We have not sanctioned this proposal, but have authorized the Chief Commissioner to take action if, on MilleFs arrival at Peshawar, tremble occurs or appears to be imminent.9. A recrudescence-&apos;of strikes is reported by a Press telegram from Bombay. Nearly 10,000 employees of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company working at the Parel and Matunga railway workshops have gone on strike demanding the restoration of the gratuity stopped since 1917, and a 20 per cent, increase in addition to that already sanctioned. The behaviour of the strikers has been disorderly, trains being stoned and damage done to workshops ; the small police force present could do nothing. At Matunga station the strikers forced the Poona-Delhi train to stop for an hour and pelted it with stones.10. The following is a fuller report of the firing by the police on members of the Kallar tribe in the village of Perungamanallur, Taluk Tiramangalam, district Madura.The Kallar inhabitants of the village notified for registration on 29th March under the Criminal Tribes Act, failed to appear. A special magistrate went to a village and warned the Kallars of the consequences of resistance, but without effect. Warrants were issued and a reserve of police sent for to prevent, any breach of the peace in making arrests. The reserve police, numbering 50, reached the village on 3rd April, and finding a crowd of between 600 and 1,000 Kallars armed with spears, swords, sticks, &amp;c, tried to persuade them to give up those named in the warrants peacefully. The sub-magistrate and the special deputy-magistrate urged them to surrender the men, the police being removed to some distance and arms piled. The Kallars, however, remained obstinate. One was arrested by a sub-inspector and head constable but immediately rescued. The crowd increased in numbers and became dangerous, throwing stones, brandishing weapons, &amp;c. When the magistrate and police were enveloped on three sides, orders to fire were issued by the sub-magistrate on the advice of the special deputy-magistrate. The police formed square and fired two rounds of buckshot. The mob continued to advance and firing with ball was ordered. About one round per constable was fired; II persons were killed and 8 injured, and the mob was dispersed.The district magistrate visited the village on the morning of 4th April and arrested eight of the rioters. On enquiry he found that the Kallars had even before the arrival of the police collected and armed with intent to resist the authorities by force and that a determined attack was made on the magistrates. He considers the firing.fully justified and that it did not exceed what was necessary.   At the inquest a
verdict of justifiable homicide was returned. No previous concerted.attempt to evade registration had occurred. The judicial trial of the rioters is being proceeded with without delay.The trouble has been made the occasion for addresses to mass meetings of Kallars by George Joseph, a barrister, who has urged them to agitate against the Criminal Tribes Act, and has formed the subject of grossly exaggerated reports in the Hindu.11. The Bombay Government report a collision between four British officers and the villagers of Bhagur,&quot; near Nasik, Bombay. The officers were chased ancl stoned. Enquiries are proceeding ancl a fuller report will be sent.12. The Hunter Committee Report with despatches, was published, on 20th May. It is impossible to foretell the probable nature of its reception by either the European or the Indian public, or the. possible reaction on the Caliphate agitation.Emigrants to Afghanistan. In a message [195] dated 4th June the Viceroy reported that the number of Indian Moslems who had emigrated to Afghanistan did not exceed 50. Most of these were bad characters from the North-West Frontier Province who had been unable to gain an honest, living in India. They were not welcomed by the Afghans, who found them a source of embarrassment.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Imperial News Service. The Governor-General, in reply to an offer made by telegram on 2nd June, telegraphed on 5th June that his Ministers represented that the annual meeting of the Press Association had decided against accepting any assistance from the Imperial Government. The Government of Canada was not sure that the hew proposal would provide anything like as extensive an imperial news service as that contemplated in the proposals under consideration, but it was the best that could be arranged under the present conditions, ancl they appreciated the generous offer of the Imperial Government.Franco-Canadian Commercial Conventions. On 7th June Lord Derby reported from Paris [No, 080] that a memorandum received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that the French Government were anxious that there should not be a serious disturbance of the economic relations between trance and. Canada, and desired that the clauses of these Conventions which related to the Customs should be continued to be applied by a tacit understanding until the signature of a new arrange-ment for the conclusion of which the French Government were ready to enter at once into negotiations. Canadian goods would therefore continue, after the .19th instant, to enjoy the benefit on entry into France of the conventional regime which had been abolished, if the Canadian Government accepted, this proposal and consented to adopt a similar policy with regard to French goods imported into Canada.Miscellaneous. Telegraphing on 2nd ancl 9th June the Director of Information reported : (1) That the Canadian West Indian Trade Conference was in session with a large representation ; Lieutenant-Colonel Amery, M.P., and Captain. Edwards representing the Imperial Government. .(2) That the Council of the Canadian Navy League had endorsed the Jellicoe naval defence plan for Canada.(3) That business conditions in Canada were generally satisfactory, ancl that the bank clearings for the week ending 3rd June had been 18 per cent, in excess of those for the corresponding period last year.(4) That the Soldiers&apos; Settlement Board of Canada had received over 62,000 applications from veterans, who desired to take advantage of the &quot;scheme, while loans amounting to over $05,000,000 had been approved.AUSTRALIA.Meat.--The Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State on 21st May transmitting the following message from his Prime Minister : A large conference representing the whole meat industry waited on me to-day with reference to the alarming effect on the meat industry of Australia of the 17-2 C
congestion of meat stocks in Britain and desired me to urge on the British Govern-ment the necessity for clearing up the accumulated stocks of meat in Great Britain at the earliest possible date, to prevent irreparable damage being done to the producers of the Commonwealth and to the reputation of Australian meat.At the time of the despatch of my telegram, 19th April [B.E.R., xvi., p. 10], the. producers were not aware of the vast accumulation of stocks.   In view of the fact that this accumulation has practically closed the market for further supplies, the Conference strongly urges the British Government to continue the present meat contracts until, say, the end of the year.This will be acceptable to the producers and will ensure, the stability of the industry until such time as normal conditions of trade prevail, particularly with regard to shipping and general market conditions. It will also obviate the possibility of competition in the British market, with the large stocks already in the hands of the British Government, which must be cleared off before the normal avenues of trade can be resumed. This is most essential from the point of view of the British Government and the Australian producers. I therefore urge the continuance of the contracts until the end of the year.In reply, the Secretary of State, telegraphing on 26th May, said : Referring to your telegram of 21st May as to meat, His Majesty&apos;s Government, provided that the assent of the various States caii be obtained, would &quot;naive no objection to, and would indeed prefer, the substitution of a definite date for the termination of the meat contracts in place of the uncertainty of the date under the existing contracts. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that, while such date should be fixed to permit the inclusion of the current season&apos;s output in the contracts, any portion of the output of next season should be excluded. It is assumed that the 30th September 1920 would permit a sufficient margin of time to all the Southern States for this purpose. In the case of Queensland, His Majesty&apos;s Government, in view of the special circumstances, suggest 30th November.Proposed Re-establishment of German Consulates [B.E.R., xvi., p. 10], On 1st June the Secretaiy of State for the Colonies informed the Governor-General by telegram that, so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were disposed not to object in principle to the appointment of German consular representatives, while reserving full right to object on personal grounds to any individual appointment, whether of an honorary consul or a consul de earriere, and the Canadian Government and the Union Government concurred in this attitude. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had enquired whether the Government of the Commonwealth would be prepared to agree to the appointment in Australia of honorary German consular officers who were not German subjects or of German origin. Such appointments, if filled by persons acceptable to that Government, might prove of convenience, e.g., if a visa were desired for the purpose of proceeding from, Australia to Germany.The Secretary of State desired to learn the Commonwealth Ministers&apos; views with regard to this suggestion.   -NEW ZEALAND.Meat, On 20th May the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State as follows :  fThe Prime Minister feels considerable anxiety regarding the prospects of the New Zealand frozen meat trade, and has asked me to make further urgent representa-tions to vou on the matter, as no reply has yet been received to my telegrams of 22nd March [B.E.R. xiv., p: 9], 9th April, and 5th May [B.E.R. xvii., p. 8]. Since the despatch of the first-mentioned telegram it has become increasingly evident that great financial difficulty must arise when the new season opens, unless fully adequate arrangements are made for relief. Owing to serious delays in the arrival of refrigerated steamers the New Zealand stores are now filled to their utmost capacity, in consequence of which a large quantity of stock, which under ordinary conditions would have been slaughtered before 30th June, would have to be dealt with after that date. It will thus be seen that an extension of the Imperial purchase to December, at least,.is a.matter of vital necessity to this country. Emphasis is also laid on the fact that, even under the best shipping arrangements that could be hoped for, heavy stocks of meat owned by the Imperial Government must necessarily remain in store in the Dominion and in the United Kingdom when &quot;the new season opens, and in
due course&apos; be marketed in conjunction with such free meat as can be shipped. This, combined with the delay which must arise in shipping the new season&apos;s free meat, will depreciate market values for live stock in the Dominion, and for frozen meat to such an extent as to create serious financial difficulties for producers. It is evident that only the provision of the greatest amount of refrigerated tonnage possibly available and an extension of Government purchase can enable the position to be met. A representative meeting of producers is to be held on 27th May, and a reply before that date is greatly desired. It is earnestly hoped that you will do all you can to impress His Majesty&apos;s Government with the seriousness of the position with which the Dominion is faced and of the necessity of affording the relief indicated.In reply the Secretary of State telegraphed on 26th May, saying :  Referring to your telegrams of 10th March, 22nd March, 9th April, 5th May and 20th May as &quot;to meat, His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that the answer has been delayed, but they felt bound carefully to re-examine the whole situation in view of the further representations of the New Zealand Government.The amount of mutton and lamb under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government is already excessive, so that disposal presents a great difficulty. Every effort is being made to deal with the abnormal situation. There are no ships waiting discharge here through lack of storage accommodation, and a substantial reduction in prices has effected an increase in consumption ; while every effort is being made to reduce the congestion by sales on the Continent, even if they have to be made on credit, There is in spite of all this no reasonable prospect that consumption here can overtake supply, and every probability that until well into 1921 the United Kingdom market will continue to be over supplied. His Majesty&apos;s Government are reluctant, therefore, - to increase their commitments by any purchases in respect of the 1920-21 season which would only increase their difficulties in dealing with existing supplies.It is further doubtful whether it would assist in the direction desired if His Majesty&apos;s Government purchased the remainder of the current seasohs production in New Zealand which has not passed through the works by 30th June 1920; the purchase would only increase the difficulty likely to be experienced in conducting the new season&apos;s operations by increasing the quantity which would have to be transported from New Zealand and disposed of on the United Kingdom market before there was a clear field for normal trading operations.His Majesty&apos;s Government, for these reasons, do not see their way to depart from the decision in my telegram of 13th March [B.E.R., xiii., p. 10].Question of Trading with certain Territories formerly Austro-Eungarian .[B.E.R., xvi., p. 10]. In reply to the telegram quoted in the above reference the Governor-General telegraphed on 2nd June to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the following terms : An Order in Council will be issued immediately revoking the Order in Council of 17th November 191.9, and providing that the prohibition of the importation of German, Austrian, and Hungarian goods shall still continue, but that such prohibition shall not apply to goods manufactured or produced in territory which now forms part of the Republic of Czecho-Slovakia, or of the kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, or of the kingdom of Italy, or to goods manufactured or produced in Bulgaria or Turkey.SOUTH AFRICA.Property Rights of German Nationals.-Qa 4th June the Governor-General . telegraphed to the Secretary of State at the request of his Ministers, to represent to His Majesty&apos;s Government the position in connexion with the property rights and interests of German nationals, who were resident or domiciled in the Union of South Africa, or the South West Africa Protectorate, and.have been permitted re-entrance, and to carry on their previous business. In certain instances portions of the properties of such German nationals, being within the jurisdiction of the Board, of Trade, have been vested in the Public Trustee of the United Kingdom, or are being dealt with by the Imperial authorities in terms of the Treaty of Peace. The Ministers are of opinion that where any German national is permitted to,continue to reside in the &apos;Union, or the South West Africa Protectorate, his property should be restored to him, and&apos;they would be glad to learn whether His Majesty&apos;s Government concurs.Native Affairs. On 26th May, ReuteFs Capetown agent reported that General Smuts had that day moved in the Union House of Assembly that the Bill relating to native affairs should be read a second time.   He adhered to the policy already
formulated by the Government of segregating the natives, but said that the Govern-inent recognized that they could only proceed if they carried the natives with them. The present Bill was therefore the first step in the shaping of a correct native policy. General Smuts said he feared the consequences of allowing matters to drift because the attitude of the natives towards. Europeans was becoming&apos;increasingly antagonistic as the result of industrial conditions.Telegraphing again oh 2nd June, he said that the Bill providing for the estab-lishment of a commission under the Minister of Native Affairs to consider matters of administration and legislation affecting the natives, and further empowering the aforesaid Minister to summon a congress to ascertain the views of the natives, had been read a second time in the Union House of Assembly, and referred to a select committee.Some criticisms had been passed in the course of the debate, one section contending that the Government should introduce a more comprehensive measure, while others had argued that the Bill was unnecessary.In reply, General Smuts had rebutted both views, maintaining that there need be no fear if Parliament took the natives into their confidence. The Premier once more emphasized his adherence to the segregation policy, which was the law of the land, While Parliament must remain the sovereign authority, he saw no clanger in allowing the natives to manage their own domestic affairs. He finally appealed to the House to assume responsibility towards the natives in. a spirit of justice and tolerance.South Africa and Europe&apos;. Telegraphing on 3rd June, Reuter&apos;s Capetown agent said that General Smuts, in au interview, had emphasized South Africa&apos;s desire to keep clear of European entanglements, mentioning France&apos;s recent independent adoption of the most drastic measures against Germany, which, he thought, were, calculated to destroy the last vestige of Government, and to reduce her condition to that of Jtussia. He also condemned the Polish offensive which the League of Nations ought to have prohibited; he feared that the Polish operations would tend to rally Russia, and to revive the apparently diminishing forces of Bolshevism. He also pointed out that the old empires which had disappeared had, at any rate, kept the smaller nations in order. Nothing was replacing them because the great Powers would see to it that the League had no vital force behind it, He asked whether the statesmen of Europe wrere really deeply in earnest about the chaos in the direction of which the old world was drifting.The Asiatic Question [B.E.R., xviii., p. 11].--According to a telegram sent from Capetown by Reuter&apos;s agent, on 27th May, the commission appointed by the Govern-ment some months ago-to enquire into Asiatic labour in South Africa has issued an interim report, in which it recommends, in view of the considerable number of Indians desiring to return home, that if opportunity offers, and there are good prospects of employment in India, the Union Government should provide certain facilities for their return.Low Grade Mines [B.E.R., xyii., p. 9].-Telegraphing from Capetown on 28th May, ReuteFs agent said that in its final report, the Commission on Low Grade Mines opposed the payment of State subsidies, unless it should be considered necessary in the single case of the East Rand proprietary mines where a stoppage of pumping would cause the flooding of the adjoining low grade mines. It was considered proper that a full enquiry should be held before any. mine was allowed to close clown. In reference to the &quot;colour bar,&quot; the majority of the commissioners rrrged the extension of the piece-work system, thus enabling natives to earn higher wages, as well as securing more efficient utilization of native labour.The commissioners also suggested that inducements should be offered to 1 natives to remain in the mines for longer periods.
