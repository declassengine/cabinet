INDIA.Policy of the Indian Government in regard to the Amir. Ori 9tli December the Amir wrote a letter to His Majesty the King. The Indian Government asked for instructions with regard to the sending of a reply, and submitted reasons why, in view of existing circumstances, this should be held up for the present; and on 7th January the Secretary of State informed the Viceroy that he concurred in this view.The Amir also addressed a letter to the Viceroy; and, after some discussion of the situation, on 15th January the Secretary of State telegraphed his approval of a draft reply, of which what follows is a summary :  &quot;No suggestion regarding the management of our tribes can be permitted, we must deal with them at our own time and in our own way. This was announced by Mr. Grant at Rawalpindi, and the request for a.cessation of hostilities against our tribes went to show that v\li Ahmad had failed to explain to him the purport of that announcement. The. present operations against the Waziristan tribes (who had persisted in rebellious conduct) would continue until they had not only received punishment, but had given guarantees. As to the desired minor frontier readjustments, the discussion of them could not take place until the time had come for the negotiation of a friendship treaty. -The Amir is then asked to reflect on his position in regard to Mr. Grants stipulations regarding his conduct of foreign relations. The first use Afghanistan had made of its freedom in the matter of those relations was to send Missions to and admit Missions from the Bolsheviks, whose bitter hostility towards all forms of civilized government in Europe or Asia was such that no civilized country would admit their representatives. The Afghan Consul-General at Tashkend had published violent articles against Great Britain; whilst the Afghan Mission to Moscow had proclaimed its hatred for the British and its admiration for the Bolsheviks, who were assembling trained agitators in Central Asia, with the object of making trouble in India, and who constantly proclaimed that the condition of their friendship was hostility to Britain. The Viceroy asked whether the demonstrative friendship of Afghanistan for these people must not make it very difficult for Great Britain to believe that her friendship was really desired. In addition to this marked friendship for the Bolsheviks, Indian seditionists for example, Obeidulla--had been allowed to remain in Afghanistan.- Further the Amir was reported not only to have received and interviewed a large number of.our tribesmen, but to have praised and rewarded them for having fought against us. Certainly the intrigues with the tribes had continued ; the presence and activity of Shah Daula at Wano was evidence of this, and from the sending of rations and money from Afghanistan it seemed that he had official support. Keports too had been scattered about the border to the effect that there was only a six months&apos; truce, at the end of which the Amir would demand that the British should retire to the Indus.The Viceroy goes on to say that he is sure ,the Amir must &quot;recognize that he has not carried out his engagements, and so has made it difficult for the British Govern-ment at the present moment to contemplate negotiations for a permanent treaty of friendship. Recognizing, however, that misunderstandings may have arisen, the best means of discovering and clearing them away would be a full and frank discussion by word of mouth. Such a discussion would aim at a real examination of any existing obstacle to a good understanding, and the preparation of a firm foundation for a treaty of friendship at some future date.Another Letter from the Amir. On 6th January the Viceroy reported [No. 26 S.] that he had received a very friendly letter from the Amir. This letter was dated 27th December, and in it the Amir again expressed his hope for a durable friendship,, and thanked him for the good treatment of the Afghan envoy.Mahmud Tarsi and the Ordinance regarding Rouble Notes. The Viceroy also-reported [No. 26 S.] that on 27th December Mahmud Tarsi, the Afghan Foreign Minister, had written to the Foreign Secretary, in regard .to.the^Or.dinance prohibiting the possession of rouble.notes.. He expatiated on the loss which would thereby be entailed on Afghan merchants, and suggested the devising of some better arrange-ment, so that the minds of merchants and capitalists might be set.at rest.
The Kings Proclamation. On 30th December a telegram was received from the&apos; &quot;Viceroy reporting that His Majesty&apos;s Proclamation had been hailed with joy in Bengal by all sections of the people, Europeans and Indians, Moderates and Extremists. The morning papers had received it with enthusiasm, and expressed the united feeling of -common devotion to the Throne. The Madras New India described the Proclamation .as a political document of the highest value which would take precedence of every other in their history. The Bombay Chronicle and the Times of India both pleaded fdr the widest possible amnesty. The Leader in the United Provinces considered the Proclamation the most momentous document in British Indian history. The Independent described it as a message of hope and endeavour to the people of India, and as a link in the golden chain that connected India and England. The Tribune of Lahore applauded the Proclamation as not only carrying the charter of Indian liberties further than the Proclamation of 1858 and all. subsequent Proolama-tions. but as representing the substantial fulfilment of what was contained in them. The Press almost unanimously .welcomed the terms, and urged all Extremists, Moderates and officials, Indians and Europeans, to co-operate loyally for the success of the new era. Pandit Moti Lai Nehru, when opening the Congress at Amritsar, gratefully referred to the Royal Proclamation, urged the Congress to convey to His Majesty its sincere homage and humble appreciation of the Royal benevolence in a befitting manner, and to give a hearty welcome to the Prince of Wales. It is under-stood that the Committee of Congress has, after a prolonged discussion, decided to accord the grateful thanks of the Congress to His Majesty for his gracious message. The clauses of the Proclamation are still being discussed. Disappointment is felt at the omission of an expression of sympathy with the Punjab sufferers, and a resolution enumerating points of omission is being framed for approval. B. G-. Tilak, president of the Indian Dome Rule League, wires : &quot; Please convey to His Majesty the grateful and loyal thanks of the Indian Home Ride League and the people of India for the Proclamation and amnesty, and assure him of its responsible co-operation.&quot;At the conclusion of the presidential address of the Moslem League a resolution conveying grateful thanks to His Majesty for his gracious Proclamation was put from the chair and carried.A telegram was received from the Viceroy on Sth January reporting as follows : Hunter Committee. This has not been sitting during the Christmas holidays. In the Press, interest has centred on the Royal Proclamation.Congress at Amritsar. No detailed reports have been received. When it reassembled resolutions were passed (1) endorsing the action of the Congress Sub-Committee for non-participation in the Committee; and (2) while recognizing the great provocation which led to the sudden outbursts of mob frenzy, regretting and condemning the excesses committed in Punjab and Gujurat. The prominent speakers were Chakravarti Ghancli, B. 0. Pal and Swami Shardanaiid.All-India Moderate Congress at Calcutta. Sir Siraswamy Aiyar, in his presidential address, said that profound gratitude was due to all who had laboured to place the Reforms Act on the Statute Book. - The country was deeply moved by the gracious Proclamation, and India was profoundly grateful to His Majesty for this exercise of Royal clemency and his desire, to inaugurate reforms in an atmosphere of general goodwill and harmony. The Reforms Scheme, was a decided advance, and there was. no justification or need for belittling what had been granted. If they turned their attention to the constructive task lying before them and worked for the success of. reforms, they need have no fear that the next instalment would be delayed by the British nation. He strongly condemned the Punjab occurrences in view of recent-evidence before the Committee, and hoped that reparation would be made and the officials who had acted unreasonably be brought to justice. He claimed that Indians should be freely admitted to employment in all arms for the defence of the country (including the artillery, the Navy and the Air Force), with an immediate organization, of a territorial army. . .Moslem League-Ainritsar.-Hakim Ajmal Khan, President, reviewed the unrest and the repression of the Delhi-Punjab disturbances, lie severely, criticised .0&apos;Dwyef. As to reforms, he urged the continuance of the-constitutional struggle and united -efforts to make&apos;the reforms a success. He pleaded for the consolidation of Hindu-Moslem unity, and, citing religious authorities who&apos; supported snbstitutive sacrifices
of&apos; other ianimals for cows, urged the immediate -contraction of. the cow killing areas, particularly the holy cities of the Hindus, and advised propaganda work by the-League and the Caliphate Committee. In regard to the Ottoman Empire, the Caliphate and the Holy Places, he said fhat Moslems could not forget that over the-lands in which the Holy Places were situated, none but a Moslem, could have.any semblance. of right to mandatory or other rule. Trampling on Moslem sentiments, would mean the permanent unrest of the entire Moslem world and the awakening of unfriendly feelings in unobtrusive people. He criticized the Anglo-Persian Agreement as the last straw on the load of Indian Moslem anxiety, and described Persia as the Egypt of Asia, which would cease to have any conception of political liberty.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Participation in a Scheme of;Belief for Austria. On 7th January the Secretary &apos;of . State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Govern or-General as follows:-It is considered that any assistance from Canada in the financing of supplies procurable there, for Austria and possibly other countries in need of relief, would be of the utmost value, and accordingly it is suggested that the Canadian Government should join -with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the United States of America in any considered scheme for the joint provision of credits, which may eventuate as the result of representations made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the United States Government, and of proposals recently laid before Congress by the Secretary of - the United States Treasury. As regards the latter proposals, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is asking His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington to communicate to you all relevant telegrams already exchanged on the subject, and to keep the Dominion Government fully informed of subsequent developments.In continuation of the foregoing, the Secretary of State telegraphed on the following day that Sir William Goode, Director of Relief, who had personal acquaintance with the state of affairs in Austria, suggested that, as an emergency palliative and as supplementary to Canadian participation in any comprehensive scheme of credits, the Canadian Government might send a cargo of wheat or flour to Trieste to relieve the very serious distress at present existing in Austria. The suggestion was that the cost of both cargo and freight should be borne by Canadian funds.On 12th January the Secretary of State telegraphed that the Director of Relief furnished the following further information. The Allied Governments had given Austria permission to raise a loan on the tobacco monopoly, by which it was hoped she would obtain some 3,000.000L for the purchase of foodstuffs. The loan, however, had not yet been negotiated. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government in consultation with the United States Government were also proposing that Austrian pictures should be substituted for foreign securities and the salt mines, in connexion with the 48 million dollars borrowed from the United States by the three Powers and advanced to Austria for the purchase of foodstuffs. The proposal was that the pictures should not be sold, but should be held by the Powers for, say, ten years. This was suggested with the object of freeing liquid assets and of facilitating purchases of further food supplies, but so far the Italian Government had not consented. His Majesty&apos;s Government were shipping, out of their relief appropriation, .260,000L Worth of lard for Vienna, and also were sending two cargoes of.coal; and 11,500 tons of flour were being shipped early that month from United States ports. The latter represented the British unexpended balance of the 48 million dollar loan. His Majesty&apos;s Government were also bringing all possible pressure to bear on the, -Governments of Czecho-Slovakia and Yugo-Slavia to induce them to fulfil contracts with Austria for deliveiy of coal and foodstuffs. Generous contributions were being anade by the public-in the United Ivingdomto unofficial funds for the relief of -Vienna, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were contributing 11. for. every 1/. subscribed. The abovevmeasures were only palliative, as the minimum requirements monthly of. Austria in-imported cereals were at least 45,000 tons. . The Italian authorities were removing children from Vienna and providing for their feeding. ^ .
Changes in the Gabinet.-The following changes&apos; in the Cabinet have been announced:- -;- - -:&apos; , .: ,,The Hon. James A. Calder becomes Minister of Militia, and; Defence, vice Major-General S. 0. Mewbum, retired ; the Right Hon. Arthur.L. Sifton has left the Public Works Department to become Secretary of State, his place as Minister of Public Works being taken by the Hon. J. D. Reid ; the Hon.. M. Burrell was transferred from the Secretaryship of State to the Customs and Inland Revenue Department; and the Hon. Arthur Meighen has become Minister of Mines.Sir Robert Borden has left Canada for several months; during his absence the Right Bon. Sir George Poster will be Acting Premier, and the Right Hon. N. W. Rowell will be in charge of the Department of External Affairs.AUSTRALIA.Harvest Conditions. Under date of 10th January, the Governor-General of the Commonwealth transmitted the following message from the Prime Minister: Wheat. The severe drought has most seriously affected the harvest all Over the Commonwealth. In some States there is an almost total failure. New South Wales, for example, is short of 16 million bushels for her local requirements. The position now is, that if the next harvest should be poor the Commonwealth will have to import wheat for local consumption, and will, of course, also lose its trade with the Eastern, South African, and Egyptian markets.We are naturally very anxious to retain this trade, and the present financial circumstances of the Commonwealth make it imperative that we should do so, but until we have positive assurance that the next harvest will be at least fair average we dare not deplete our local stocks, which at present are only sufficient for about 15 months&apos; local consumption. This means that we cannot even fill orders in the present season for oversea markets, and that our wheat growers, who during the war had been compelled to take much less thanworlchs price, will thus not be able to take advantage of present prices, and the Commonwealth, financially and otherwise, will be seriously prejudiced. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia therefore suggest that the Royal Wheat Commission be requested to favourably consider the following three alternative methods by which the Commonwealth can be materially helped : (1) The Royal Commission to allow us to ship their wheat to fill up our South African orders. The Commonwealth to replace any wheat thus loaned from the Royal Commission from the next Australian harvest. (2) In order to allow us (a) to retain our oversea markets, (b) to assure local requirements in case of partial or total failure of the next harvest, the Royal Commission to give us an option up to September 1920 over, say, 10,000,000 bushels of their wheat; or (3) the Royal Commission to resell to the Commonwealth 10,000,000 bushels of wheat recently sold by us. What we really want to guard against is the shortage of wheat for local require-ments, and at the same time not to lose our oversea trade. As a matter of fact the probabilities are greatly against next harvest being a total failure, and if, we had assurance from the Royal Commission that if the necessity arose they would lend us 10,000,000 bushels it would relieve the situation very greatly.Queensland.Appointment of Lieutenant-Governor. On 8th January the Governor of Queens-land telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the following resolution, passed by the State Parliamentary opposition in the Legislative Assembly, had been forwarded to him. He was requested to transmit it by telegram, in the hope that the Secretary of State would consent to withhold the commission of the new Lieutenant-Governor pending further consideration of his appointment: That the appointment as Lieutenant-Governor of this State of the Hon. William Lennon, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, until recently a member&apos;of the Queensland Labour Government, is objectionable to this Party, and to a very large section of the public of this State, for the following reasons : -The very extreme partisan nature of the appointment; the danger consequent thereon of improper interference in the Queensland constitution, through the abolition of the Legislative Council, contrary to the expressed desire of the electors by the &apos;      7-4. B &apos;    &apos; ,: &apos;. &apos; i--&apos;    - &apos;
referendum of 5th May 1917, or by the appointment of additional partisan members to destroy the Councils usefulness and independence, at the instance of a Government already discredited by the recent Commonwealth election vote;&apos; tlie nature of the views publicly expressed by Mr. Lennon in conjunction with the present Minister for hallways, and otherwise countenanced by him during the war period, and while holding office;of Minister under the. Crown. In forwarding this resolution Sir Hamilton Goold Adams desired-to-say that..he would never have recommended the appointment unless he had felt quite certain that Mr. Lehridn would, when called upon, perform his duties without partisanship, and with a full sense of the responsibility resting.on him as a representative of the Crown.Pursuing the same subject, Sir Hamilton telegraphed on 9th January that he had that day received a protest from a majority of the Legislative Council against the appointment of the new Lieutenant-Governor; for the following reasons : That&apos;as a member- of the Legislative Assembly he had- signed a pledge to carry out the programme of a political party, which withheld support to Australia and the Empire during&apos; the- war, had. many leaders of separatist tendencies, and avowedly was--determined to abolish the,State Governor and the Legislative Council, and therefore lie-was-not free to exercise independent judgment. Consequently the existence of the Legislative Council was threatened, as well as the constitution and peace and  order, of the State. In forwarding this protest Sir Hamilton only desired to comment that it presupposed that the person named could not and was not prepared to. sever his connexion with the Parliamentary party, which Sir Hamilton felt sure he intendedNEW ZEALAND:Wvol, Meat and Dairy Produce.-The following telegram was received from the Governor-General of New Zealand on 21st January : I have been asked by my Prime Minister to represent that there is, on the part of producers in New Zealand, serious anxiety as to Whether His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to: continue after 30th June next the requisition of wool, meat, and dairy produce. They are particularly anxious with regard to meat, because, judging by present, appearances, it will be impossible to ship the whole of the Imperial meat until after 12 months from now; Mr. Massey woidd be grateful if you would do all you can to get [an early] decision on the matter.--. .       SOUTH AFRICA.Election Speech by General Smuts. On 13th January Reuter&apos;s Pretoria agent telegraphed as follows : With the intensifying interest over the approaching general election, which is-likely to be the most exciting ever contested in South Africa in modern times, great attention is being paid to the vehement statement of General Smuts in reply to a criticism of his policy by Colonel Greene, of Natal. The Premier protests against the incoherent old note of flagwagging and senseless fault finding, and affirms that, but for the strong patriotic line of the Union Government during the war, South Africa to-day -would be in even a worse position than Ireland, instead of which she is perhaps the most. peaceful and prosperous country in the wide world. General Smuts says that Colonel Greene objects to his speaking about a South African flag, though he does not object to Australia having its own flag, and South Africa was&apos;going to have it with, he- felt sure, the complete goodwill of both English and Dutch.His second offence was to have explained the altered status of the British Empire ; he had said that the Empire was now a new Commonwealth and all its members were free and equally joined together by the single constitutional bond of kingship, as well as- by common ideals&apos; of a political government. Here extremes met and a jingo Colonel was found embracing the secessionist General, saying that General Smuts&apos; constitutional position was quite wrong. What, however, he repeatedly said had been, said by the Ministers of Canada and Australia, and had never once1 been challenged&apos;by England. . He happened to see a leader in the London Times of 19th December 1919, with reference to the Prince of Wales&apos; &quot; great and
truly historic speech at the Mansion; House. General Smuts q noted the following passage from it:- &quot;&apos; -  &apos; &quot;&quot;.&apos;,/-&quot;.&apos;-;;&quot;,&apos;-   .Never before has there been, such a partnership of great nations, united in one political system, yet with a single tie the Throne to, which each-gives allegiance.   In this the Prince was fortunate in the moment of Ins visit. &quot; The principle of equality of/nationhood within the British Empire, was slowly attaining recognition before the war -superseding that other conception of the. Empire as a &quot; Mother Country &quot; with a number of&quot; daughter States. The. war: revealed it as the bond which holds the Empire together -a bond so intangible that it seems negligible to foreign observers,&apos;yet potent as no&apos;.other bond: could be.   We doubt, as we have said often since the Armistice, whether the&apos;, principle of Dominion equality with Great Britain is yet- thoroughly understood here. The Prince yesterday warned Great Britain against failure to understand it. The.Prince&apos;s: warning, said General&apos; Smuts, should; not pass unheeded, even jn. Natal.   The British Empire was far grander than an empire in the older sense;of&apos; the; term, as-its younger members were now universally recognized as nations by their signing of the Peace Treaty.   General Smuts also-quoted Mr. Lloyd George on the same occasion at the Mansion House, as confirming all he had said:, and remarked that he (General Smuts) in a modest way was perhaps the first to point out the new. status of the&apos; Empire at a complimentary dinner given him at the House of,Lords in-&apos; May 1917, when lie said &quot;that the true ideal of the future was a league of free, and equal States, bound together by a common kingship.&quot; %   ... -The Prime Minister denied the various allegations on the disbandment of the Natal militia. He defended blue-grey as the new colour of the South African uniform in preference to khaki, instancing the light blue of the Air Force and emphasizing that there was absolutely nothing racial or political about- the new colour.In concluding, General Smuts referred to the biting terms of Colonel Greeims prediction of the coalition of the South African Party and the Nationalists, and asked if that was intended as a racial appeal to Natal to vote against the South African Party. The poor old South African Party, having clone their work during the war, might now be relegated to the scrap heap; was that going to be Natabs attitude? He had too much faith in his British fellow citizens to think them capable of such behaviour; the Dutch had shown themselves worthy of the friendship of the British, and only on the solid basis of that friendship and trust ought the future structure of South African politics to be built.Appeal by General Smuts for Central Europe. On 15th January ReuteFs Cape-town agent reported that, in view of the terrible distress existing and growing in many parts of Central Europe, General Smuts had issued a fervent appeal to the people of South Africa to help to relieve that distress, especially in the case of children. He stated that it was his sincerest desire &quot; to see South Africa associated with this great and urgent work of humanity.&quot;General Smuts, describing his own impressions during his visit to Central Europe, declared in eloquent and feeling terms that, unless relief were organized on the largest scale, millions of men and women must die soon, while the remainder would survive only as a crippled race. Starvation and disease were producing terrible mental and moral conditions; the blackness of night was closing over the ruins and devastated lands, and the darkness of a great doom seemed to be settling down over large parts of Christendom. The victory of the Allies might be over-shadowed by the clanger of an immeasurable defeat for humanity, and the people of South Africa, who were richly blessed despite the increased cost of living, dare not sit still as Christians while millions were stricken down with starvation and disease. Those who lived in a land of plenty and whose lot was a happy one might not look with cold unconcern on all that world of human misery.Their common humanity, religion, and the ideals forming the common indissoluble framework of civilization bound the white races together. If white civilization were to suffer a setback, our own mere outpost on the Black Continent would soon feel its dire effects. Consequently the appeal was made to all South Africans; &quot; but,&quot; General Smuts proceeded, &quot;I would add a special prayer to the Boer people not to forget the generosity extended to them after the Boer war, not only by those who had been their enemies, but also by some of the very countries who were now crying for help.&quot; The appeal concluded with a heartfelt hope that the &quot;Save the Children Fund&quot; might find wholehearted co-operation in all churche3 and parties and among the whole population of the Union.
- Aerial Communications. In response to the enquiry [B.E.R. viii,, p. 7] as to -what would he a fair amount for the prize that General Smuts is prepared to grant for a flight from London or Cairo to the Cape, the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed on 13th January that General Sykes suggested 10,OOOZ. as a fair amount to offer as a prize for a Cairo to the Cape flight if the flight were completed &quot;before 29th February.. Competitors would have to make their own arrangements as to how they reached Egypt from England, whether by sea or air. In view of meteorological conditions becoming unfavourable after the end of February, the Secretary of State asked for a reply by telegraph at the earliest possible moment.Durban Municipal Employees&apos; Strike. On 9th January .Reuter&apos;s Durban agent reported that the preliminary negotiations for .the settlement of the strike of the municipal employees there had failed owing to the refusal of the Council to delegate its powers to a committee of strikers pending the settlement of the dispute. That afternoon the employees, following the precedent of the Johannesburg municipal strike, had appointed a Board of Control, which had immediately brought about the resumption of the borough services. The strikers had agreed to the proposal of the Council for a joint board to negotiate with a view to the settlement of the dispute. Telegraphing again on the following clay he further reported that the strike of the municipal employees as a protest against the dismissal of the assistant town clerk had ended. The terms of settlement stipulated, that there should be no victimization ;. that the services of the assistant town clerk should be retained pending the decision of the public committee of enquiry into the complaint of the town clerk, who was responsible for the dismissal of his assistant; and that full pay should be given for the period of the strike.
