MESOPOTAMIA.Suggestion for the Appointment, of an American Military Attache. On 3rd November tbe following telegram [No. 925] was sent to Mr. Scott in Cairo : Please explain to the American.agent that the present military operations in Mesopotamia are carried on by a small column with a strictly limited transport, which would render the presence of a foreign military attache unsuitable and involve practical inconvenience. Moreover, the High Commissioner in Mesopotamia considers that if negotiations pursue their present course they are likely to terminate before the foreign office]- could arrive.In these circumstances we hope that the proposal to send a military attache will not be pressed.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xxix, p. 4]. The Alceroy reported [1246 S.] on 26th October that the two officials referred to in his telegram of 15th. October, whose release had been stipulated as one of the conditions of acceptance of the AnuYs invitation, had been handed back at Chaman on that date.On the subject of the previous correspondence which had passed between the Viceroy and the Amir, the Secretary of State telegraphed [2921] on 29th October to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed with. the proposition that a clear statement of the Amir&apos;s attitude towards the Bolsheviks must be a preliminary to the resumption of negotiations. Without reliable information on this point it would be impossible to decide finally as.to the future policy. Tbe existence of mere friendly relations between the Afghans and the Bolsheviks need not impose a barrier against our coming to terms wdth the former; but if it were proved that the Afghans had actually come to an agreement with the Bolsheviks, which they did not repudiate, on the terms which the evidence in our possession indicated, it woidd be impossible to consider a treaty of friendship, which would involve the renewal, of a subsidy to the Amir, and a grant of material assistance to the Afghan Government.With a view of inducing tbe Amir to declare himself, the Secretary of State suggested that the Viceroy should observe the following procedure. The Amir to be informed by letter that His Majesty&apos;s Government were quite prepared to negotiate a treaty with him and to send their representative to Kabul for the purpose. At the same time the Amir should be told of the astonishment with which His Majesty&apos;s Government had heard that he had recently concluded a treaty with the Bolsheviks which could not be considered other than inimical to Great Britain. The terms of this treaty, as known from secret sources, were to be enumerated in the letter, and the Viceroy was to add that certain stipulations arising from these terms seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government so incredible, that they judged it only fair to give the Amir an opportunity of repudiating them. This was to be followed by a request that, if the Amir had concluded any agreement with the Bolsheviks, he would communicate the exact terms to the Viceroy, so as to observe perfect- loyalty between tbe two Governments. The letter was to conclude with an intimation that, pending-a clearing up of the matter, no useful purpose would be served by sending an envoy to Kabul.The Viceroy was authorized to address the Amir on the above lines immediately,, subject to any further comments he might wish to make.On 1st November the Viceroy acknowledged [1266 S.] this telegram, and expressed the general concurrence of the Council with the lines laid down by the Secretary of State. Owing to uncertainty as to the latest -form of draft agreement, however, they were not in a position to confront the Amir with specific clauses. Further, in view of the fact that friction between the Afghans and Bolsheviks had developed in consequence of the fall of Bokhara, it seemed probable that the Amir would not ratify
the agreement before farther negotiations with us. In these circumstances the Viceroy reported that he had made slight modifications in his letter to the Amir. After addressing the. Amir in friendly terms, he explained that a wireless message from Hopner, the Bolshevik head in Tashkend, to Suritz, the Bolshevik representative in Kabul,-had been received by our installation in Peshawar, in which Suritz was congratulated on the establishment of final and mighty relations between the Russian. Soviet and the Amir of Afghanistan. The Viceroy added that there was reason to believe that certain stipulations had been made by the Bolsheviks, such as the location of their consulates at Ghazni and Kandahar, in return for a subsidy. In expressing his difficulty to believe that such Bolshevik claims could be founded on fact, the Viceroy pointed out that any agreement, designed by the Bolsheviks against Great Britain, made between them and Afghanistan, could only be looked on as an unfriendly act, which would render impossible the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between Great Britain and Afghanistan. Having pointed out the difficulty and uncertainty attending the position in which he was then placed, the Viceroy asked his friend the Amir to deal with him with reciprocal candour and to tell him whether or no such an agreement had been arrived at, and if it had, what were its precise terms.The viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The conclusion of the report for 24th October is here given, followed by the weekly report for 30th October : I. (2ith October). Para. 8. The Punjab non-co-operation meeting had little success in practice, due rather to reluctance on the part of the people to make a personal sacrifice than to any want of hostility to the Government, which is increasing and being more openly expressed.Meetings were held on Jullundur to prevent Europeans from being entertained at the Dussehra horse fair. The trial in Lahore of Zafar Ali Khan caused considerable excitement, and witnesses were freely abused ; but on the whole the prosecution had a sobering effect.Panipat Man (? his), charged under sections 124a and 153a Indian Penal Code, was convicted and sentenced to five years&apos; rigorous imprisonment. One of the accused threatened the magistrate to look to his own safety.The active participation of the dissatisfied section of the Sikh community in the extremist political agitation is now a serious feature of the situation; the wearing of large kirpans is becoming general; at the Sikh league yesterday at Lahore, the non-co-operation resolution was carried as the only means to attain swaraj ; Gandhi was present and also held a long conference with the students of Lahore College. Local members of the general council of Anjumani Himayati Islam accepted non-co-operation, and resolved to move the Anjuman council to refuse the Government grant, and to disaffiliate Islamia College. The Tribune, a Lahore newspaper, condemns the boycott of schools and colleges; referring to the failure of a similar movement in connexion with the partition of Bengal.Malaviya, addressing a mass meeting at Lahore last week, advocated complete swaraj as the only remedy, and disagreed with the non-co-operation programme only on two points, the boycott of councils and the withdrawal of children from the schools. In keeping, however, with his temperamental absence of backbone he has announced his intention of not seeking election to the councils on the grouud that he intends to devote his full time and energy towards the attainment of swaraj, endeavouring to formulate a programme in full accord with the wishes of the people.9. Assam. Leading Hindus and Mohamedans in Sylhet now express regret that the conferences reported last week should have been held, and especially deplore the fact that B. C. Pal was allowed to speak. Title-holders agreed to be guided by the Government pleader as to whether titles should be renounced ; he has taken a strong stand against non-co-operation. In the Assam valley non-co-operation was adopted at various, meetings, from which the older leaders were absent, and in- which little enthusiasm was aroused. There is no lack of candidates for the councils, only one constituency not having nominated one. The tea gardens in Dumduma resumed their normal aspect, though the district is still garrisoned by the Assam Rifles.10. Central Provinces. A stormy meeting of the provincial Congress committee was held on 3rd October at Nagpur, when the formation of a non-co-operation board to introduce a complete scheme of non-co-operation in the province was discussed. Threats of resignation wrere (? made) if anything beyond a boycott of councils were approved. At a subsequent meeting on 1.1th October it was resolved that the non-co-operation board should be divided into-two sub-committees, one to arrange
Immediate boycott of councils and the other to deal with the remaining stages of non-co-operation after the Nagpur congress. A number of meetings at various places in the province were held in support of non-co-operation. There were some inflammatory anti-British speeches and considerable outbursts of violent talk. The prosecution of a few individuals is under consideration. The opponents of non-co-operation were generally shouted clown; the practical manifestations of non-co-operation are one resignation from the provincial council, two resignations of titles, and three of honorary magistracies. The arbitration court is said to have-decided one suitable criminal and one civil case at Jubbulpur.11. North-West Frontier Province. The attempted revival of hijrat in Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan districts is showing signs of collapse, 200 already having returned of 600 re-sent muhajarin. Non-co-operation is being preached in places, but has not hitherto received any practical support.12. A general appreciation of the industrial situation lias been reported in our recent telegrams. The Bombay post office and telegraph &apos;strike continues, no . progress having been made towards a settlement. Baptista states that the only remedy is for the Government to depute the presidency postmaster and himself to enquire into the cost of living in Bombay, and to report on the sufficiency of the increase of pay already granted. The Bombay gasworkers&apos; strike is unsettled, and the tramway strike continues. The Eastern Bengal State Railway employees demanded the appointment of a committee to investigate grievances. The Budge-Budge Oil Depbts have struck work. The Calcutta gasworkers are still out, though a certain number of men have returned. The situation in the tea gardens in Northern Bengal is serious, and it is feared that a large number of small private gardens will have to close clown. There is a partial strike in the locomotive workshops of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company at Jhansi, but the railwaymen&apos;s association is not in sympathy with the strikers. There are indications that the extremist Press, hitherto strongly pro-labour, is alarmed by the strike epidemic, and it is more guarded in comment, e.g., the Independent suggests that workers should always threaten to strike but never strike. - The Press reports serious trouble in Buckingham mills, Perambur, Madras. The European weaving master was assaulted, and pulled out a revolver in self defence; this was snatched from him by the workers, but the weaving master escaped. The police were called in and a search for the revolver made ; it was given up by Wadia, to whom it had been sent. It is understood that a lock-out has been enforced at the mill; 700 men are out of work. There have been no further signs of violence. There have been two attempts at the derailment of trains, one, on the main Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Company&apos;s line, being almost certainly made by a dismissed gang of men ; one resulted in a serious accident, 13 being killed and 22 injured,&apos;all Indians. A force of police has been drafted to the section to assist in guarding the line, and villages have been warned.II. (30l7i October). Gandhi continued his tour in Punjab, where he has tried to kindle excitement among the Sikhs and has attempted Mohamecl Ali&apos;s tactics in Islamia College, Lahore, and Khalsa College, Amritsar. In a speech at Lahore he said that it was the duty of his supporters to annihilate the tyrannical Government and that such a fearful Government had better be wiped out of existence. He referred to the bravery of the Sikhs who had shed their blood in different battle-fields for the British Government and were requited by the horrors of martial law. lie urged them to adopt non-co-operation with the Government, especially in the matter of supplying recruits for the army. As already reported, non-co-operation has been accepted by the Sikh League, and the attitude of the Sikhs is distinctly disquieting, but, so far as the propaganda of non-co-operation goes, it has had no effect on recruitment for the army or police or on the loyalty of the civil officers of the Government. To the students of Lahore and Amritsar, Gandhi made seditious speeches urging non-violent non-co-operation as the only means of securmg real independence for those who were not able to use swords. Great temporary excitement was caused among the students.. His action in tampering with them is viewed by the parents and elders with disavowal and disfavour. The students were encouraged to form a Non-co-operation League and to defy the authority of their [parents, on the analogy that they would not obey their parents if ordered by them to eat beef and pork. But the latest reports from the papers indicate that the excitement among the students is dying. The situation in Islamia College is hopeful, and in the D.A.V. College out of 1,024- students only 24 have- so far withdrawn their names. Shaffs presence at Lahore had a calming influence.   About 350 students of Islamia College have signed a protest against non-
-co-operation. The college has been closed for 10 clays. From a confidential report we learn that great pressure was brought to hear on Lala Harkishon Lai to withdraw his candidature for the elections at a private meeting held in Lahore. To the Sikhs present Gandhi said he would insist on non-violent methods, but if in spite of his -advice the Sikhs intended to take risks they might do so. Lala flarkishen Lai said that Gandhi was taking a great risk upon himself in preaching non-co-operation -among the inflammable masses of the Punjab, ancl he himself would not support the programme; but he would not oppose it unless he foresaw mischief resulting. He feared the Sikhs might have recourse to violence, and if he saw a likelihood of this he should oppose Gandhi.The Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab has declared the districts of Lahore, Amritsar ancl Sheikhpura as proclaimed districts under the Seditious Meetings Act, as a continuance of public speaking on the present lines in the central areas of the Province must lead at no distant date to outbreaks of violence and disorder. A communique issued by the Local,Government gives a full and adequate explanation of the necessity for this step, which has only been taken after repeated warnings, and will be withdrawn as soon as the present violence of speech is abandoned. Public meetings held within the municipalities of Lahore and Amritsar will for the present be exempted from the provisions of the Act. Religious and election meetings may he held without permission. Zafar Ali Khan has been convicted by the district magistrate, Lahore, to five years&apos; transportation-; the news created some local sensation, the city observing partial hartal. Gandhi left Punjab for Bombay to meet Wedgwood, but is still fomenting trouble at Aligarh by writing to the trustees. He hopes for a peaceful evolution, of the struggle and that the Government will not restrict liberty ; but if the Government wish to suppress peaceful action, he hopes they will issue no internment orders as it will not be possible for him to respect any such orders unless his personal movements are physically restrained. The letter was written ostensibly -on account of the report that the police had been called in to aid the trustees. Gandhi offered to attend the meeting to advise the trustees. The honorary secretary at once replied denying that any special or Government aid was being invoked, declining to invite Gandhi to meet the trustees, and stating their adherence to the old established policy. During the week there was great excitement in both camps, parents, trustees ancl old boys arriving at Aligarh. The establishment of a national educational institution with Mahomed Ali as principal ancl Abul Kalam Azad head of the religious instruction has been put forward by Mahomed Ali&apos;s party. The trustees held a meeting on 27th October; 62 trustees, including those of Hyderabad -and the Punjab, were present. The traditional policy of the college was strongly supported by an overwhelming majority. The proposal of Shaukat Ali and eight other trustees to renounce the Government grant ancl the University charter and to disaffiliate the college from the University of Allahabad was rejected. The action of Shaukat Ali interfering with the college discipline by inducing the students to adopt non-co-operation was disapproved: the measures taken by the principal ancl and syndicate were approved. A message of support and encouragement was received from many trustees unable to attend and from old boys, parents and other well-wishers of the college. It remains to be seen what action the students will take on the decision of the trustees, but the Local Government has considerable hopes that the majority will settle down, their first enthusiasm being dispelled. We think it is possible that Gandhi&apos;s efforts to influence the students will bring great discredit on. the wdrole of his mischievous campaign.In Bombay Gandhi is now urging the students to form a Students&apos; Non-Oo-operatlon Association and to witbdrawr from Government-owned or aided institutions.At a meeting of the Western Iudia Liberal Association, Sir Narayan Chandavarkar, Mr. K. Natarajan, and Sir Dinshaw Wacha condemned the non-co-operation movement, the last speaker calling it political suicide. In Madras, the district conference at Vizagapatam rejected the non-co-operation resolution by a large majority.Last week&apos;s telegram contained no detailed report from Bihar and Orissa. It is as follows: The non-co-operation movement agitation is being vigorously prosecuted in some districts, but so far with little success. Sporadic attempts have been made to found arbitrationtribunals and induce people to bring grievances before them, but without success. The efforts which have been made to induce villagers to refrain from voting may have some success owing to the ignorance of the villagers. Attempts are being made to enlist the support of students in colleges and schools ancl to -organize bands of volunteer workers, but with little success. Political activity has 22-2 B
increased somewhat. Counter manifestoes have been published by the moderates; and both in Gya and Patna respectable men are strongly opposing non-co-operation in all forms. The Congress sub-committee, consisting of Gandhi, Patel, Kelkar, Rangasirami, Iyengar, have published a report on the draft constitution of Congress for public criticism. The main change in Article 1, stating that the object of the Congress is the attainment of self-government by the people of India by all peaceful and legitimate means, omitting constitutional. To make the Congress representative and deliberative, they propose that the district should be the unit for returning delegates in proportion to the number of inhabitants, one lakh of population being entitled to one delegate. Congress provinces are being re-arranged on a linguistic basis, numbering 15. Each provincial committee may elect as many delegates to Congress as the number of the All-India Congress committee members allotted to it. The&apos; abolition of the subject committee is proposed and the reduction of the members of the All-India Congress committee to 100 as a sub-committee for the session. The chairman of the reception committee is not to speak for more than 15 minutes, and the president not more than 45.There are no developments of importance to report as regards industrial unrest, the chief interest in this connexion being centred in the All-India Trade Union Congress, at which Lajpat Rai will preside.We have no fresh news from Bombay, but that Presidency and the Punjab are the two areas which cause the chief anxiety. In Delhi, the volunteer movement is developing. In Bengal, the financial proposals of the (? Jail-Joint) Committee are exercising moderates, ..and extremists also, bnt the export of wheat continues to be a,subject of some comment.THE DOMINIONS.Proposed Meeting of the Imperial Cabinet. The following replies to the telegram sent to the Dominion Governments by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on .13th October [B.E.R., xxix, p. 8] have been received :  1. From the Governor-General of Canada : With reference to your telegram of 13th October I quite agree with you that it is desirable that a meeting of what has been called the Imperial War Cabinet should be held during the coming1 year. The most suitable time for the meeting would probably be the month of June. It is.my purpose to attend if the meeting is called. I would urge that the agenda should be prepared with such precision and in such time that not more than two weeks or thereabouts, should be required for our discussions. It is considered here that thtflA&amp;n^uI^ results during the coming year.2. From the Governor-General of New Zealand:  With reference to your cypher telegram of I3th October, I am asked, by my Prime Minister to say for the information of Mr. Lloyd George that, owing to the fear that at any time an industrial upheaval may occur, Mr. Massey thinks at present that it will be almost impossible for him to leave New Zealand during next year. The Attorney-General (Sir Francis Bell) proposes to visit England early next year, and it could no doubt be arranged for him to act. The Prime Minister considers that he is well qualified capably to represent New Zealand either at the Imperial Conference, if held, or at meetings of the Imperial Cabinet. Sir James Allen is also fully qualified in this respect; there should therefore be no difficulty so far as tbe representation of this Dominion is concerned. The Prime Minister will be better able to judge later on of the position and will definitely advise me then.3. From the Officer Administering the Government of South Africa:  With reference to your telegram of 13th October, General Smuts requests that Mr. Lloyd George may be informed that if the Prime MinisteFs conference is held in the latter part of June 1921 he hopes to be able to attend. The^Union Parliament will - sit probabiy until the end of. May, and if the conference should be held before the middle of June it would be difficult for him to attend.
On 2nd November the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of Newfoundland : Please inform your Prime Minister that a meeting of the Imperial Cabinet is being arranged by Mr. Lloyd George for about the middle of June 1921, and that he hopes that it will be convenient for your Prime Minister to attend.Postal Congress [B.E.R., xxix, p. 9].-On 27th October the Officer administering the Government of South Africa reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Union Delegation had been instructed by the Government to support the United Kingdotu Delegation when the Committee&apos;s recommendation came before the Congress for a final decision.On 29th October the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and to the Officer administering the Government of South Africa, informing each that similar instructions to those of his own Government had been sent to the delegates of the other Dominions, and that the Committee had agreed on 22nd October that the Swiss proposal should be withdrawn in Committee. This had been done; but it was possible that the matter might be brought up again in plenary congress by the South American delegates.CANADA.Bacon [B.E.R., xxix, p.. 10]. On 26th October the following message from his Acting Prime Minister was sent by the Governor-General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies for Mr. Lloyd George : My cypher telegram of 17th October has not yet been acknowledged. Navigation closes at Montreal in about three weeks. It is important to have the bacon shipped before that date, otherwise there will be a \o^ArMB^MJMfkTiQ&apos;ce\i&amp;i any offer at all for the October and September bacon, although they have been informed that an offer has been made. An urgent reply is desired in order to avoid further depression on the live stock market, and a heavy loss to packers.On the same day, but before the receipt of the above telegram, the Secretary of State telegraphed the following message to the Governor-General for transmission to his Prime Minister, being a reply to the latter&apos;s telegram of 17th October : My telegram of 25th September [B.E.R., xxvii, p. S] stated that the general decontrol of Canadian bacon was thought quite impossible at the present time. &apos; At the original conference between the Food Controller and myself the Canadian packers&apos;agents suggested the decontrol of distribution and importation subject to a maximum price. They definitely stated that the Canadian packers were quite satisfied with the prices hitherto paid and then existing. I requested the Food Controller to try to make arrangements on&apos; the lines suggested by the agents. The Rood Controller, after further conferences with the agents, offered to accept the distribution scheme subject to some alterations and supervision by the Ministry, provided that the agents would import and sell at the then existing maximum prices, with which they had previously expressed satisfaction. The Food Controller would only consent to the agents&apos; distribution scheme provided that importation at the existing maximum prices could be undertaken by the agents. So long as the Ministry is paying a subsidised price the Food Controller is bound to maintain the existing system of distribution, which is entirely a domestic concern of this country and is supported by the whole trade. The agents then stated for the first time that tlie)^ must have a higher maximum price. The Food Controller could not concede this owing to the general levelling up of prices which would be involved. Conse-quently the compromise&apos;broke down, but as an alternative the Food Controller made on 9th September, through the Canadian representatives, Messrs Mills and Thomson, the offer set out in my cable of 25th September to pay for the September putdown 35 cents per lb. f.a.s. ordinary stowage, 31 cents per lb. refrigerated stowage. It is therefore quite incorrect to say that no offer has been made by the Ministry to purchase the September putdown. Owing to the labour situation in this country the Government cannot make any present statement as to the cessation of control. The statement that the Ministry have always paid a higher price for Canadian than for American bacon is absolutely correct. The net average price for Canadian bacon per cwt. throughout the entire period of the Ministry&apos;s purchases sine
August 1919 has been 3 cents per lb. over American Wiltshire after allowing for all premiums on exchange, which is 6s. per cwt. more than the maximum differential (10s. per cwt.) ever obtained under free trade. As regards Danish, the Ministry last winter paid for one small lot of 200 tons of Danish bacon more than it was paying at the same time for Canadian in order to restore export from Denmark, which had entirely ceased during the war. As soon as the Danish factories started, the working-price was at once reduced, and has since always been below the price paid for Canadian, although the former is a superior article purchased on more favourable terms. The price fixed by the Ministry for Canadian bacon last autumn was not arbitrary, but was agreed with the producers on the basis of a differential over price of American hogs. As previously stated, the Food Controller is extremely anxious to keep up the supply of Canadian bacon. He realizes, however, that merely paying a large sum for one month&apos;s putdown of bacon already made will not help the hog industry. He is therefore prepared to co-operate with the Canadian Government in making arrangements which will secure a future supply both of hogs and bacon. In these circumstances the Food Controller will pay immediately 35 cents per lb. f.a.s. for the September putdown, and will agree to pay such further amount up to 37 cents as is proved by independent costings investigation into the September workings. Further; the Food Controller will pay for the October and succeeding months&apos; putdown so long as the Ministry controls the prices of Canadian bacon on the original sliding scale already established with the Canadian packers based on a 5 cents differential above the average price of Chicago hogs. Both these offers are conditional on the Canadian Government, who are also interested in the bacon industry, or the packers guaranteeing farmers the same differential for at least 12 months from the present date, should the Ministry cease buying in the meantime, so that they will be able to breed hogs now with an assurance of favourable prices when they are marketed. As the Canadian Government contend that the Ministry&apos;s buying induces a lower price for Canadian bacon and hogs, the guarantee should be purely formal when the control ceases. If the Canadian Government are not prepared to co-operate, the Ministry can only regard the question as a purely trading&apos; matter, and will continue to, offer monthly what they consider a reasonable price having regard to world conditions. This price for the September putdown, as already stated, would be 35 cents. In the meantime, on the assumption that the Canadian Govern-rnent will co-operate, the Ministry are approaching the Treasury for authority for the necessary subsidy and are increasing bacon prices to the highest figure which they can j ustify in the interests of the consumer. The quality of Canadian bacon has recently been so unsatisfactory that in any event the Ministry must insist that any-future, contract shall contain terms that the packers will pay all claims assessed by an impartial trading body in this country for depreciation of standard cut, trim, and cure, and that all sides under 45 lbs. or over 90 lbs. must be shipped as seconds.In reply to this, the Governor-General, on 1st November, telegraphed to the Secretary of State that his Ministers stated that, in. regard particularly to that portion of the telegram relating to the proposed plan in which the Government of Canada would be financially interested, his suggestion would be fully considered, but that some time must elapse before a definite answer could he given. In the meantime, and in order to. relieve pressure, they agreed to accept 35 cents for the September production with a, further amount up to 37 cents if they could prove higher cost, and they would accept 35: cents^ for the October production both f.a.s. Montreal. The Minister of Trade and Commerce suggested that the British. New York office should be authorized without delay to give effect to these arrangements for September and October, and to open negotiations for the purchase of production during November and the following months.On 5th November the Secretary of State telegraphed1 as follows to the Governor-General in regard to his telegram of 1st November :--The Food Controller made it quite clear that his revised offers for September and October and the. succeeding months&apos; bacon were both conditional on the Canadian Government continuing the guarantee therein set out, and that unless the Canadian Government, was prepared to co-operate he could only regard the question as a purely trading matter, and would continue to offer monthly what he considered a reasonable price having regard to world conditions. No variation in these terms can be made. If. the Canadian Government agree to the Food Controller^ suggestions payment will be made accordingly, otherwise the price to be paid for the September jmtdown will be 35. cents per lb.   The Ministry consider 35 cents for the October putdown too high
having regard to hog prices that month. Unless, therefore, the Canadian Government agree/ the Food Controller^ scheme,price offered for the October putdown is 34 cents. In any event the October bacon will only be accepted subject to compliance with the technical conditions cabled by the Ministry to the New York Mission, who will, on application, supply all concerned with details. The conditions applicable to September bacon are the same as in the case of the July and August shipment. The Ministry have informed the Mission that the Canadian.. packers are at liberty to ship the September putdown, subject to the settlement of price, on the clear understanding that the price will be only 35cents per lb. unless the Canadian Government accepts the Food Controller^ scheme. They are cabling New York that the October bacon also may be shipped on the clear understanding that the price-will be only 34 cents per lb. in similar circumstances. If the scheme should be subsequently accepted, prices can be adjusted in accordance with the offer contained in my telegram of 26th October.Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs :-(1) &quot;Prohibition&quot; has been maintained by large majorities in Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and an Order in Council will be,passed by the Dominion authorities forbidding the importation of intoxicating liquors into these provinces. British Columbia declared against &quot;Prohibition&quot; and in favour of Government control and sale by a majority of 30,000.(2) Mr. F. W. Gray, a mining expert, states that Canada has enough coal for all present and prospective future needs.NEW ZEALAND.Butter [B.E.R., xxix, p. 11]. On 5th November the Governor-General of New Zealand reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Prime Minister advised him that he had now received from all the butter producers of New Zealand an acceptance of the Imperial Governments conditions of purchase for creamery milled dairy and whey butter manufactured by them. Mr. Massey stated that the rate of storage charged by the owners of the cool stores were, owing to well-known conditions regarding the cost of coal, labour, &amp;c, higher than those current under the previous- butter contracts, and he suggested that the producers should, after the expiry of the six weeks&apos; free storage allowed, for, be reimbursed the actual storage incurred provided the rates did not exceed those current on 1st August 1920. It was also desired that the small trade for butter existing between New Zealand and Honolulu, the West Indies, Caledonia, &amp;o, should be continued, and the Prime Minister requested that permission should be given for free shipment up to a total of 100 tons for the season.Wool [B.E.R., xxix, p. 11]. The Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of New Zealand on 5th November as follows : Your telegram of 21st October has had the most careful and sympathetic consideration from the Minister of Munitions. The Ministry has up to the present held stocks of New Zealand wool very firmly, recognizing that the current prices, especially of coarse crossbred wool, must be very near the cost of production and that a very grave consequence might result if any further serious decline took place. It is the intention of the Minister of Munitions so far as possible to handle the Govern-ment&apos;s stocks of wool in such a manner as not to cause injury to the legitimate interests of wool growers. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot, however, give an unconditional assurance that tbe selling prices of the stock held by them will be permanently maintained at about tbe present level. The possibility of this must depend to some extent upon the action of the New Zealand woolgrowers, and the movement of prices of similar wool in foreign countries could not be altogether disregarded.SOUTH AFRICA.Enemy Tonnage [B.E.R., xxix, p. 11].-On 2nd November the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Officer administering the Government of South Africa with reference to his telegram of 15th October, instructing him to inform his Prime Minister that the Shipping Controller, whom Lord Milner had consulted, stated that he had communicated further with the High Commissioner, and that in the case of the Union the proposed partition of enemy tonnage, surrendered in accordance with 22-2 C
the provisions of the Armistice or of the Peace Treaties, would he regarded as entirely without prejudice to the final disposal of tonnage captured, seized or detained during the war by constituent parts of the Empire, and that the acceptance of the proposed principle would not be construed as affecting any claim upon ex-enemy vessels which were-not subject to the authority of the Reparation Commission which the Union, might wish to make.A United South African Party. ReutePs agent telegraphed as follows from Bloemfontein on 27th October: A great speech by General Smuts, the Prime Minister, marked the opening of the congress of the South African, party, which assembled here to-day to consider one big question, viz., the formation of a new party out of all sections of the South African people in. support of the constitution and against the Nationalist policy of secession.General Smuts, who was given an ovation, said the country must either move forward or backward. The position was, that the Nationalists had become a republican party, whose chief aim was to secede from the British Commonwealth. They still talked of acting constitutionally, but how long would they be satisfied in their headlong course with that position ? Their ideas of what was constitutional were very elastic.Plereeniging reunion had failed, continued the speaker, because the Nationalists insisted upon independence; hence to-day the Nationalists&apos; motto is &quot; South Africa a republic,&quot; while our motto is &quot; South Africa a&apos; nation.&quot; We are really the national party of South Africa, and they have become a republican party. The Prime Minister proceeded to quote from speeches by Generals Botha, Steyn and Hertzog showing the great common spirit there was at the time of the union. Who had wandered away since then? he asked. He emphasized that there had been no interference by England, and that South Africa had grown to a higher status which secession must destroy, quite apart from separating the white races. The tendency of the Nationalists was to create a new and more dangerous &quot; uitlander &quot; question. A house divided against itself could not stand.General Smuts made a vehement, earnest appeal urging the necessity of a strong government party on non-racial lines to guide South Africa through the present critical times; South Africa was threatened on the one hand by a strong party working deliberately for political revolution, and on the other by a smaller but growing party straining for a social and economic revolution, and behind them was the spectre of Bolshevism, which made even1 Labourites nervous. And the natives meantime, observing all this, had begun to talk of their African republic. Consequently, looking to the great future within&apos;;South Africa&apos;s reach, she was now making a last attempt to form a new united party of all moderate citizens, of whatever race or party, to form a strong government. He did not demand too much from anyone, no dissolution or extinction of the South African party, but reorganization and expansion, the opening of the door for others. The details could be threshed out later. Thousands of moderate people, General Smuts continued, were waiting to join such a party, and so were thousands of other parties,.and he doubted whether the moderate Nationalists would long remain aloof. In the meanwhile, he anticipated that many Unionists would join it, No, he declared, the coalition bogey will not frighten us. He would bid all welcome.In a brilliant peroration the Prime Minister said the narrower reunion had failed in order to make way for a larger reunion. This larger reunion was based, firstly, on the principles of co-operation of the South African party ; secondly, along the lines of his own appeal, to all parties sitting in Parliament; and lastly on Mr. Malan&apos;s resolutions at the Plereeniging congress.By the path of peace, peaceful development and co-operation, ancl not by the path of division and violence, he concluded, we seek to create a true South African nation.The Prime Minister resumed his seat amid loud applause, and his speech was frequently punctuated by cheers.The Prime Minister later moved a resolution embodying the principles of his speech and asking the congress to appeal to all agreeing with such principles to join in such an expanded South African party.The ex-Nationalist leader, Professor Eremantle, sent the following telegram, which was greeted with loud cheers :  Hearty greetings.   Thousands of Nationalists who desire to respect bothsections of the population and maintain complete freedom without secession and build up a great nation extend to you the hand of friendship.
Mr. Burton, the Minister of Finance, iu an eloquent speech in English, strongly supported General Smuts and revealed the fact that only the state of his health had prevented, the late General Botha from making the same appeal as General Smuts had just made. Amid great cheering he affirmed that if they must fall let them fall in this cause with honour. But he declared they would not fall. Mr. Malan, Minister of Agriculture, aroused loud cheering by a speech denouncing the purely racialist policy of the nationalists. Delegates from the body of the hall welcomed the speeches of the Ministers and made helpful suggestions for the success of the proposed new party. Others emphasized the fact that General Botha&apos;s co-operation policy of 1914 still held sway. There were appeals for better organization, and Mr. Nicolas de Wet, father of the Minister of Justice, in paying a tribute to the British, said they had as good men as their Dutch brothers, and there were portfolios which must be filled (laughter and applause).Sir Thomas Waft, Minister of the Interior, quoted the late Cecil Rhodes as saying that the English could not govern the country without the Dutch. Sir Thomas said to the Nationalists : You cannot govern the country without the goodwill and interest of the English (loud cheers). There was a dramatic moment when Commandant Opperman displayed a hat he wore in the Boer war which had been riddled with British bullets, and appealed to all to keep their word of honour given to the Constitution.Mr. C. F. Stallard enthusiastically supported General Smuts, pointing out that after the recent happenings in connexion with the natives, the white races should stand together and not haggle over the question of a republic.Throughout the afternoon other speakers supported General Smuts&apos; resolution in enthusiastic addresses. The resolution was carried unanimously amid great cheering.Telegraphing again on 2nd November, ReuteFs Bloemfontein agent reported as follows: At the momentous congress of the Unionist-party which is being held to consider General Smuts&apos; appeal for the formation of a moderate party on non-racial lines, the leaders made a strong appeal to the delegates to support General Smuts. Sir Thomas Smartt moved the following resolution : Recognizing that the disruptive influences in South Africa have become a growing menace to the maintenance of the Constitution and to the peace, progress and development of the country, this congress welcomes the Prime-MinisteFs appeal to unite to combat these influences ; and, recognizing the necessity for a strong party to maintain the fundamental principles of the Act of Union, this congress authorizes the leader, with the party executive, after full consideration of the situation, to take the steps best calculated to secure this end.Sir Thomas Smartt was strongly supported by Sir Percy Fitzpatrick and by Messrs. J. W. Jagger and Patrick Duncan, members of the Legislative Assembly. Sir Thomas Smartt&apos;s speech is regarded as being probably the best in the Unionist leadeFs long and distinguished career. He emphasized the fact that there had been no arrangement whatsoever in advance with the South African Party. Amid loud cheers the speaker paid a tribute to the splendid stand made by the South African party at the Hereeniging congress. A new situation, he proceeded, had developed, and the Nationalist party&apos;s menace to the Constitution outweighed all minor con-sideration. (Cheers.) Unionists would be prepared to sacrifice mere party interests for the real interests of the State. They had been justified in trusting General Botha implicitly. (Loud cheers.) When the interests of the State were endangered it was the duty of all to rally, together, irrespective of the old political sortings, and maintain the Constitution. (Cheers.) Therefore, he cordially commended General Smuts&apos; appeal.   (Loud and prolonged cheering.)Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, with his old fire and vigour, vehemently declared that General Ilertzog&apos;s latest attitude was that, if the people who supported the Constitution were in a minority of one, then they should have no say and no rights. That attitude was a declaration of civil war. (Loud Cheers.) The speaker did not call General Hertzog&apos;s followers Nationalists or even the Republican party, but the Civil War party. (Loud and prolonged cheers.) To-day they had to get a clear statement from the country as to whether the people would resist civil war or not. (Applause.) He -concluded by strongly advocating union with the Sotith African party.Sir Percy was given a splendid reception.
Mr. Patrick Duncan was warmly cheered when he made an eloquent plea to his hearers to support the adoption of General Smuts&apos; appeal and so work for the maintenance of the Constitution and the preservation of racial unity. Such a policy,, he said, would make for the fullest development of South Africa,&quot; for the benefit of both races. (Applause.) In conclusion, Mr. Duncan urged the congress not to desert the Constitution for a chimerical independence.   (Loud cheers.)Mr. J. W. Jagger, in an intensely practical speech, urged all to go into the new party wholeheartedly so that they would make their weight felt and get the maximum voting power.Many speakers from the body of the hall enthusiastically supported the resolution on the ground that if the Unionist party were to be broken up, as was most likely, then they should turn their hearts to their South African party friends.The vast body of popular opinion in the congress may be summed up in the following phrase of Mr, Blackwell, a former member of the House of Assembly : We are breaking up the Unionist party to-day to save the country from civil war to-morrow. Mr. R. W. Close, a well-known advocate, hit another general sentiment when, he said that they were not considering any question of party, but the great interests of the country.Finally, the congress unanimously adopted a resolution in favour of uniting with, the South African party.General Hertzog on the Future of the South African Party. Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed as follows from Smithfield on 30th October: General Hertzog, the Nationalist leader, was warmly welcomed here to-day on the occasiomof his visit to his constituency.Addressing a crowded meeting, he affirmed that the Nationalists were acting within their constitutional rights, while the South African party might be described as the &quot;slaap on sus &quot; or &quot;sloop and soothe&quot; party. The Nationalists took up the standpoint of independence and therefore also of secession from Great Britain, if required, as a worthy popular ideal.Referring to the South African party congress, General Hertzog predicted that it meant coalition with the Unionists and that the South African party would only remain in name. Indeed, in a few years time, in his opinion, it would mean unification.NEWFOUNDLAND.Wireless.Communications [B.E.R.:, xxxix, p. 12]. The following telegram from the Governor of Newfoundland was received by the Secretary of State on 31st October: With reference to your telegram of 18th October a long letter from my Ministers and a somewhat blunt letter from Mr. Coaker have been received by me, in which they ask to be informed in what way the Imperial Governments policy could be affected by the proposed agreement with Marconi, the main point of which is given in my telegram of 12th October and in a despatchwhich I sent you on 26th October. The letter explains that Ministers desire to secure additional means of communication with the United Kingdom and the neighbouring continent and the benefit which should accrue from Government control of such services. At the present time there is but one channel of cable communication, viz., by the Anglo-American Telegraph Company, from which practically no revenue is got by this Government.My Ministers have kept in mind the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to retaining as far as possible freedom of action in making wireless agreements, and they urge that the proposed contract, limited in scope, is merely intended to meet present conditions.My Ministers further ask whether it is true that His Majesty&apos;s Government have purchased the cable of the Direct Cable Company, and, if so, what privileges, and on what terms, His Majesty&apos;s Government could offer to the Government of Newfoundland in respect of commercial business with the United Kingdom and the neighbouring continent in relation to the use of the said cable.I suggest that there is no objection, provided that I obtain a promise of delay in the other matters, to arranging at once for the new direction finding a station at Signal Hill.
