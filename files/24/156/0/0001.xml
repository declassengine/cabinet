The Dominion Government consider that the support of the present Danish proposals for the recognition by the Great Powers of Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland should be conditional on an undertaking being given as to saleIndustrial Conference: Capital and Labour. The Director of Information at Ottawa reported on &quot;September 26th that the Industrial Conference held at Ottawa was a decided success, for while agreement was not reached on collective bargaining and the eight-hour day, the basis was laid for a good understanding that will do much to improve the relations between capital and labour (vide No. 138 of &quot; British Empire and Africa Report &quot;).Railway Employees and One Big Union. At the Annual Convention of the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employees, a Resolution was adopted declaring the One Big Union movement to be detrimental to the interests of the working people and particularly of the railway workers.Unionist Members and Coalition Government. Unionist members of the Dominion House of Commons, meeting in caucus, have expressed their unqualified approval of the war policy of the Coalition Government, which they will continue to support, trusting that the Government will shortly evolve a progressive policy, satisfactory to the country, to meet post-war conditions.Increase of Exports and Imports.  Canadian exports during August exceeded those for the corresponding month last year by $26,000,000. In other words, they have increased 30 per cent. Imports increased by $1,000,000, or 2 per cent. Agricultural products are chiefly responsible for the large increase in exports.Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment. A Committee of the House of Commons is now sitting to consider all matters relating to further gratuities for soldiers&apos; civil re-establishment.Government Mercantile Marine. Another Canadian Government Mercantile Marine vessel, the Canadian Settler, was launched at Three Rivers, Quebec, on Saturday, September 20th. v   .AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTH.Amendment of Commonwealth Constitution.

The Minister for the Royal Australian Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) is urging the necessity of a quicker steamship service to Europe, and he states that, if necessary, there should be a subsidy for an Imperial route as recommended by Generals Botha and Smuts.NEW ZEALAND.Chinese Labour for Samoa.  With regard to labour for Samoa (vide No. 133 of &quot; British Empire and Africa Report&quot;), the British Government have informed the Dominion Government that His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking has telegraphed that coolies would have to be recruited in the South as the Northern Chinese are quite unsuited to the climate of Samoa, but that the South is still outside the control of the Peking Government. The only means he can suggest is to come to an agreement with the local authorities at Canton, and it is thought that the Dominion Government should approach the Consul with an explanation of the terms offered. The British Government point out that a new recruiting organisation will be necessary, as the coolies at present in Samoa were recruited by a German firm in China under an agreement between the German. Consul at Canton and the authorities of the Province,In reply, the Dominion Government telegraphed on September 29th that the Administrator of Samoa has been instructed to inform the Chinese Consul there of the terms to be offered for coolie labour.SOUTH AFRICA.Prime Minister on South African Potentialities : Flag for the Union: and Republicanism-licanism. The Prime Minister (General Smuts), in starting his tour of the north-western district of the Cape Province, met with an enthusiastic reception at his inaugural meeting at Victoria West. After exhorting South Africa to make a new start and the white races to come together, the Premier gave a description of South Africans immense potentialities as undoubtedly the greatest mining country in the world. &quot; There is one continuous coalfield here and in Rhodesia,&quot; he said, &quot;which will not be exhausted in a thousand years and in the long run will be far more valuable than gold or diamonds.&quot;The proceedings of the meeting terminated with the large crowd singing the National Anthem.Speaking later, General Smuts urged the Union to follow the example of the United States by putting its house in order and thereby prepare for the influx of population and its great future. A number of matters, he said, still required settlement uocler the League of Nations, including the position of the Dominions, which would be determined at the forthcoming Conference.In reply to a question, General Smuts said that he felt convinced that the time would come when the Union would have its own flag.Speaking at Carnarvon on September 25th, General Smuts made a strong appeal for the abandonment of the Republican movement. Be pointed out that he had fought to the bitter end for-a Transvaal Republic, but at Vereeniging he and the other Boer leaders recognised that the course of a Republic was not Gpd&apos;s course for South Africa and must result in tearing asunder the various sections of the white population. He was deeply convinced that a Republic in future, however glorious it so 2-1 A 2
might appear to be, would be as fatal as ia the past, when no single nation put out a hand to help the Boer Republics. His view of the British Empire was an alliance, of which the King was the bond. &quot;Under this alliance,&quot; he said, &quot;we keep together to protect and help each other financially, with advice, and otherwise, each according to his own light. That is the right conception which triumphed in the Councils at Paris. You do not need to have a Republic to be free. You are free in the British Empire.&quot; It had been said that if South Africans were a free people they were allowed to secede, but he maintained that the Constitution, which had been framed by their wisest leaders, did not allow them to sece.de. Moreover, he felt that they could not change the Constitution without blood and tears. They could only change a King for a Republic by revolution. South Africa would then be a ruined country and the Afrikander people would again come off worst. &quot; Do not,&quot; he said, &quot;let us run after delusions.&quot; It seemed to him, General Sinuts concluded, that the Nationalist leaders were still animated by a spirit which he deplored, but that would not deter him from doing his utmost to revive the spirit which brought about the Union.Imperial Neios Service-In reply to the telegram from the British Government relating to arrangements for an Imperial News Service (vide &quot; British Empire and Africa Report,&quot; No. 133, under &quot;Imperial Affairs&quot;), the Union Ministers have telegraphed that they are prepared to avail themselves of the special news service for one year commencing October 1st, 1919.International Labour Conference: Union Representatives.

The chief subjects of discussion in Egypt at present are the anticipated arrival of Lord M.milner&apos;s Mission and the situation arising out of the labour unrest. With regard to the former the extremists are undertaking a campaign to induce people to boycott the Mission and are expected to attempt to engineer hostile demonstrations to impress the Mission and create an atmosphere of alarm and insecurity which would prejudice their work.A number of tramway employees are still on strike and efforts are being made to extend the Syndicalist movement, which has been prominent for some time past. The leading spirits in this agitation are foreigners. Two were recently deported, one of them being a demobilised Italian soldier who had been a prisoner of war in Hungary and had there become imbued with Bolshevist ideas through having met Bela Kun. The extremists are naturally doing all they can to -foment disorder and to utilise the economic causes of unrest for political ends.The Egyptian Government have under consideration a law for regulating the position of Labour Organisations in the country which is at present undefined.
