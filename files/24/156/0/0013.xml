EGYPT.Finance Policy. The High Commissioner telegraphed [No. 192] on 1st March that the policy of covering  E.65,000,000 and Egyptian Bank Notes almost entirely by British Treasury Bills, was the subject of much criticism in the native and French, local Press, where it was contended that the result was to bind the Egyptian pound to the fluctuations of the pound sterling. The argument that a stable exchange between Egypt and her chief customer was advantageous carried little weight. In view of the possible effect of this criticism, the Egyptian Government and the Governor of the National Bank considered it very important that a substantial sum of yold should be deposited in Egypt. Lord Allenby pointed out that the Bank&apos;s holding of gold in Cairo, to the amount of  E.3,500,000, had been commandeered by the military authorities, and that since the refusal of the Bank of England in 1910 to. earmark more gold for the National Bank, the note issue of Egypt had suffered from want of a partial gold backing. These facts were, happily, not widely known, but the suggestion that gold, the actual property of Egypt, had been taken for British purposes would provide a particularly damaging form of attack at the present moment. In April 1915 the Command Paymaster in Cairo had been informed that a payment would be made to the Bank of England, equivalent to the amount of gold withdrawn from the National Bank, for replacement in Egypt up to one month after the conclusion of peace. The Egyptian Government were now requesting that gold, to the amount commandeered, be forthwith transferred to the National Bank in Cairo. Lord Allenby supported this request.Communication of Conventions to the Egyptian Government. Lord Allenby explained in a telegram [No. 203], dated 4th March, that the Arms Traffic and Air Conventions had not been communicated to the Egyptian Government pending-consideration by Lord MilnePs Mission as to the form they should take. The pro-cedure now approved by Lord Milner was as follows: The Conventions to be officially communicated to the Egyptian Government with an invitation to accept them. It was to be explained at the same time that if the Government could show cause for thinking it. would be contrary to Egyptian interests to accept them, the wording of the British, ratification should be such as to exclude Egypt. The hope was to be expressed, however, that the Egyptian Government would accept the Con-ventions. A. similar procedure would be carried out with regard to the Liquor Traffic Convention. Lord Allenby asked to be notified of approval of the proposed procedure.Censorship of the Press.-Lord Allenby reported on 10th March by telegram [No. 223] that, in view of the violent tone of the native Press and of the pernicious influence which it was exercising in the country, he had decided to re-establish preventive censorship, which came into force on 6th March. It had been explained to proprietors of newspapers that the censorship would not affect the temperate dis-cussion in the Press of matters of public interest, but would be directed against the publication of objectionable matter, which was classified under certain headings as follows : (1) Matter to discredit the British. Government, the British Army, Allied Governments, and the Government of His Highness the Sultan ; (2) matter calculated to excite racial or religious animosities ; (3) reports, alarmist or false, which were liable to upset public tranquillity ; (4) any matter the publication of which might engender suspicions, or lead to the neglect of their duties for political reasons by public servants. With a few notable exceptions the native Press had suspended publication for three days, by way of protest. The High Commissioner had insti-tuted the simultaneous censorship of incoming telegrams addressed to news agencies-in Cairo and Alexandria.Deputies&apos; Anti-British Resolution. Reuters agent in Cairo reported on 10th. March that 52 members of the Legislative Assembly had met at the house of Zaghloul Pasha on the previous evening aud had passed a resolution protesting, amongst other things, against the British Protectorate, and proclaiming the independence of Egypt and the Sudan.A Food Department to be created. On 6th March, Reuter&apos;s Cairo agent telegraphed that the Government was creating a special Food Department with an advisory committee.
INDIA.. -&apos;, The Caliphate Question.-On 25th February the Viceroy telegraphed as follows :  At the session of the 18th instant it was resolved by the All-India Caliphate Conference to issue an appeal for funds up to Rs. 30.00,000 for deputations to Europe .and for Caliphate propaganda. Rs. 11,00,000 were promised by Bombay at the meeting. It,is expected that Rs. 4,00,000 will be raised in the United Provinces, and. Rs. 5,00,000 have been promised by both Bengal and Sind. The need for taking a pledge to secure stability in the work for the Caliphate was emphasized by the speakers, but actual subscriptions are not quick in coming in. A most bitter attitude is still adopted by some extremists in their public speeches, though a less violent tone has marked those of Shaukat Ali. The bitter attitude is to be noticed particularly in Sind speeches, and a situation calling for great vigilance is indicated by the Sind reports. There has been a broadcast distribution of violent notices, urging a Jehad. The notice, which purports to be the work of a sinful [sic] Mohamedan, gives in detail Moslems&apos; many misfortunes, expresses sorrow for the help given to the British by Indian troops against their fellow Moslems, and urges every Moslem to persuade other Moslems not to fight on any side but the Moslem. Reports from the United Provinces represent the Hind.u-Mohame.dan entente as hollow ; great bitterness, which is increasing, being in evidence between the two parties. Steadily increased tension is reported from Bihar and Orissa, where the Local Government, in order to discover .a modus vivendi, are considering calling the leading Mohamedans and Hindus together in conference. It is a matter of significance that the old bitterness of feeling revives at oiice whenever there is any concrete occasion for difference, e.g., the communal representation proposed iir the Dacca University Bill.Telegraphing-again on 3rd March, he said Mohamedan feeling has been greatly perturbed by the- utterances of dignitaries of various churches in England on Constantinople. The Bengal Caliphate Conference held on 28th February was attended by leading. Hindus and Mohamedans under the presidency of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad ; the following resolution was passed : This conference of Hindus and Mussulmans, representing all shades of opinion, most strongly and indignantly denounces the attitude of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other Christian prelates and statesmen as regards the Moslem Empire of Turkey, and states in clear and emphatic language before, all responsible authorities that if the settlement of peace with Turkey is in any way against the religious injunctions and demands of Islam, that is if the dominions of the Caliphate are not kept intact as they were before the war, then Moslems in obedience to the laws of Isiam will be compelled to cease all relations of loyalty with Great Britain and will be in duty bound to assist the (? Constantinople) Caliph against all his enemies by all possible means.The President said that any Moslems who should refuse to act according to the order of the Caliph were not Moslems. If Moslems followed tins principle they would never suffer defeat at the hands of any nation. The duty of every Moslem was to urge forcibly and repeatedly that the Moslem holy places coidd never be placed in the hands of non-Moslems, and there was every likelihood of their succeeding in their wishes. If they did not succeed, the Moslems of India should prepare themselves, and if a conflict arose between the British Government and the Moslem faith, Moslems, should stand by their faith.Although the above represents the views of Caliphate extremists, moderate Mohamedans are also greatly perturbed, and the Caliphate agitation, which was less to the front in Punjab and elsewhere during the past week, is likely to be much stimulated. A Renter report received to-day of the Premiers speech in the Commons, adhering to the pledges of January 1918, is most opportune, and will doubtless have a. reassuring effect.Labour Unrest. In his telegram of 3rd March the Viceroy reported as follows: With reference to our telegram ohjted the 19th February, settlement endeavours at Sholapur mills have hitherto failed, and attempts are being, made to carry on with one-third of the usual complement. The owners agreed in a slightly modified form to the demands prepared on the workmen&apos;s behalf by a committee of elected representatives, but these were rejected by the men, who appointed a new committee, by whom an uncompromising attitude was taken Up. The owners refuse at present to go to Sholapur, and their absence impedes any prospect of an early settlement. There is an unfavourable reaction everywhere owing to the continued high prices.
And in his weakly report of. 3rd March he said : There has been a large strike at the Tata mills, Jamshedpur ; 30,000 hands are said to have struck work.   Miller, a dismissed railway guard, has. been holding meetings almost daily in Lahore with the-object of forming an association on the lines of the National Union of Railwayman in Englaffd, and some 1,500 railwaymen are said to have joined already.   He hopes to-(corrupt group) an increase in pay by the threat of a general strike, in which the posts and telegraphs, employees would join hands, in April next.   His followers are numerous and enthusiastic, but uneducated. Eurasians and Europeans are holding-aloof.   Miller is in with the Indian extremists, who exploit the economic unrest to-keep the country in an unsettled state.The Amritsar Case. In his letter of 3rd March the Viceroy also reported that the result of the Privy Council appeals in the Annitsar National Bank case had created a sensation in Lahore. The preparations for a great public reception to-Lajpat Rai had been abandoned. Punjab had reported that the rejection of the appeals, which would presumably govern other cases, increased the value of the executive action taken under the Iving&apos;s Proclamation, which should now be recognized as a genuine refrain of clemency.Yiceroxfs Letter to the Amir [B.E.R., xii., p. 2].-Commenting on the ArniFs reply which the Viceroy had summarized in his telegram [202 S.J, the Secretary of State, in a telegram [P. 143S] to the Viceroy, dated 2nd March, remarked that knowledge of the AmiPs previous negotiations with the Bolsheviks, coupled with Afghan activities on the frontier, made the reply appear very unsatisfactory, and afforded little hope of any useful result from a conference. Consideration of military strength governed the policy to be adopted, and any action leading to a premature rupture was to be avoided. Unless the Amir were unexpectedly to give some proof of his genuine desire for peace, the proposed conference would seem the best means of keeping the Amir in play for a time. The Secretary of State-accordingly approved the Viceroy&apos;s proposed reply.Proposed Afghan Deputation to England. On 3rd March the Viceroy telegraphed [252 S.] that with reference to the Amirs letter to the King [B.E.R., x, p. 3] he had received afresh letter from the Amir dated 23rd February on the-subject of the Caliphate. The letter was couched in most friendly and temperate language, and again pointed out that by tradition the Holy Places should remain under the undisturbed control of the Caliph. The Amir said that consternation prevailed in Moslem centres, from which representatives had come to him to express their grief at the reported intentions of the Powers. To allay excitement, he proposed to send a deputation&apos; to wait on the King-Emperor, and represent their feelings, while acquainting themselves with the real intentions of the Powers.The Viceroy was of opinion that the amir&apos;s motives were to pose as champion of Islam, to head the combination of Central Asian. Moslem Communities, and to get into direct diplomatic touch with London with a view, perhaps, to the discussion of British and Afghan relations. Having in mind the extreme importance of keeping-Afghanistan cpiiet during the coming hot weather and autumn, the Viceroy advocated measures of delay which would tide us over that period, and considered, therefore, that it would be expedient to accept the proposed deputation.The Secretary of State acknowledged the above by telegram [P. 1G92] on 8th March. He recognized the advantage of the course recommended by the Viceroy with regard to the military position, but expressed apprehension as to the consequence of deviating from the policy of the Peace Treaty. The Secretaiy of State attributed the action of the Amir to the furtherance of his own political ambitions, and drew attention to the similarity of his claims on behalf of the Turks to those of the Indian Caliphate deputation now in London [B.E.R., xii., p. 4].The serious desire of the Amir to come to a good understanding was open to grave -doubt in view of the extravagant character of his demands. As Afghanistan was a non-belligerent, it had no voice in peace negotiations. Moreover, the Turkish question would have been settled, at least in&apos;principle, before the Afghan delegates could arrive in England. This might give rise to an impossible situation, and in the circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government considered that the amir&apos;s proposal must be resisted. The reply to the Amir should be to the effect that as his delegates would be unable to reach England before the Turkish settlement was concluded, the giving of facilities for their journey would serve no useful purpose.
THE DOMINIONS.Mandates. Ou 4th March the Governor-General of South Africa telegraphed, at the request of his Prime Minister, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, informing him that the delay in the issue of a- mandate for :South-West Africa was raising suspicion, and asking when the mandate might be expected ; and on the 6th. March a telegram was sent by the Governor-General of New Zealand, urging the necessity for immediate action in regard to Samoa. In consequence the Secretary of State, on 12th March, sent the following telegram to the Governors-General, of South Africa and Australia for their Prime Ministers :: His Majesty&apos;s Government greatly regret the delay which lias occurred. The following is the position. When the matter came before the Supreme Council at the end of December the Japanese representative maintained the reservation made when &apos; the terms of the mandate were discussed last summer by the Commission under Lord Milner. The necessity of inducing his Government to withdraw their reservation was urged upon the Japanese representative by the other plenipotentiaries, who pointed out that it could not be maintained in view of the terms of the German Treaty. The Japanese representative agreed finally to refer the matter again to his Government, but all endeavours to expedite their decision have so far failed. Efforts will, of course, be continued, but we fear that it is not possible to fix any probable date for the issue of the mandate. The uncertainty of the position of the United States of America in the matter further complicates the position. Meanwhile the New Zealand Government is very anxious for the establishment of civil government in Samoa, where the delay has been causing unrest, and presses strongly for the issue of an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. An Order in Council has, therefore, been prepared in accordance with their wishes, and passed on 11th March.The United States Senate Reservations.-On 13th March the following&apos;telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa : The Canadian Government have made further representations as to the combined effect of the first part of the Lenroot reservation and the resolving clause, i.e., preamble.The latest version of the first part of the Lenroot reservation is as follows: Until the Covenant of the League of Nations is so amended as to provide that the United States shall be entitled to cast a number of votes equal to that which any member of the League and its self-governing Dominions, Colonies, or parts of Empire in the aggregate shall be entitled to cast, the United States assumes no obligation to be bound, except in cases where Congress has previously given this consent, by any decision, &amp;c, of the Council or Assembly in which any member of the League and its self-governing Dominions, Colonies, or parts of. Empire in the aggregate have cast more than one vote.The resolving clause in its amended, form, requires the acceptance by the Allied and Associated Powers of all reservations adopted by the Senate and states that failure on the part of such Powers to object to reservations prior to the deposit of the ratification by the United States will be taken as acceptance.The Canadian Government point out that the first part of the Lenroot reservation, whether in its original or modified form, cannot be read, as other than a direct challenge of the status of the Dominions in the League of Nations and the denial of their right to vote. They do not understand on what ground the United States could, be given additional votes in the Assembly without changing the whole basis of repre-sentation and voting. If population is chosen, then the proportionate voting strength of the British Empire in the League would be more than double what it is at. present, and the voting strength of the United States would be reduced correspondingly. If the United States is entitled to additional votes, then other Powers are equally entitled, and voting ceases to be on the basis of membership in the League, and some other, rule equally applicable to all nations must be adopted.The Canadian Government state that they are opposed unalterably to any assent, either by positive declaration or by silence, which could be deemed acquiescence to the first part of the Lenroot reservation, and that if any reservation is finally adopted by the United States as part of its ratification -which challenges the position or status of Canada iu the League, Canada will. dissent therefrom, and a protest against its acceptance will be filed, and they, wilLreserve full freedom of action under such&apos; conditions.13-3 B
The Canadian Government are advised that ^whichever,form of the resolving clause is adopted, it would be necessary to have the assent of His Majesty on behalf of all the member nations of the British Empire, and that the dissent of His Majesty on behalf of any one of these members would prevent both the resolving clause from taking effect and ratification.by the United States. The Canadian Government enquire whether His Majesty&apos;s Government share this view.The Canadian Government&apos; have asked also that it should be made perfectly clear to the United States Government that no such reservation, either in its original or modified form, as is contained in the first portion of the Lenroot reservation could be acceded to by the British Empire.A reply was sent to the Canadian Government on 8th March as follows: His Majesty&apos;s Government recognize that the Lenroot reservation involves a-departure from the agreement arrived at in Paris, and entirely accept the view that the dissent of any Dominions Government will prevent the Empire from accepting the ] eservation. So far no official representations with regard;-to the reservation have been made to the United States Government, but in view ;df the representations of the Canadian Government and the objection of Australia and. South Africa to the second part of the reservation, His Majesty&apos;s Government are-quite prepared to make it clear to the Government of the United States that we cannot accept the reservation if and when it and the resolving clause are actually adopted, and before ratification as contemplated in the latter. The fate of the reservation, and of the whole Treaty, is apparently still doubtful, and it is worth consideration whether any public declaration now would not be used to consolidate American opinion in support of the policy expressed in the reservation.His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to have the opinion of the Canadian Government on this point, as, if they are-disposed to agree, it would seem wiser-, to see whether the reservation is finally adopted, and, if so, in wdiat form., before making any public announcement as to our position.No reply has yet been received from the Canadian Government. I will keep your Ministers informed as to developments, and as His Majesty&apos;s Government may have to take action, as indicated in the above telegram to Canada, at very short notice, I should be glad to have their observations as quickly as possible.The Admiralty Naval Staff. The following telegram was sent, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada and Australia on 15th March : . The Admiralty are anxious to arrange for the representation of the naval forces of the Dominions on the Naval Staff at the Admiralty with a view to creating, as early as possible, machinery which will facilitate the consideration in common of the naval aspects of Imperial policy. The Admiralty think that the first practical steps are (a) The training of naval officers from the Dominions in staff work ; and(b) The attachment to the Naval Staff of officers from the Dominions.The Admiralty accordingly propose that one or two officers of CommandeFs rank or below should be nominated by the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Government of the Commonwealth to join the next course for staff officers, which commences at Greenwich in September. They also suggest that one officer from Canada and one from Australia of CommandeFs rank or below should be. attached to the Naval Staff as early as practicable, so that these officers may become familiarized with Admiralty procedure and the plans for future naval development. Such officers would be responsible to their own Chiefs of Staff.The Admiralty suggest that officers appointed to the staff course and those attached to the Naval Staff should receive their pay and allowances from their respective Services. The duration of the staff course would be about 12 months. The period of attachment to the Naval Staff would be during your Governments pleasure, subject to any representations which the Admiralty might make with the object of adjusting the work of the Naval Staff in the most effective way. Please telegraph, the views of your Government.CANADA.Representation at- Washington.  On 5th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies received a telegram from the Governor-General of Canada transmitting the following statement which the Canadian Government wished to be made in the
Canadian and British Parliaments simultaneously as soon as the United States Government should have formally agreed to the new arrangement: As the result of recent discussions, an arrangement has been concluded between the British and Canadian Governments to provide Canadian diplomatic representa-tion at Washington. The need for this important step has been fully realized on both hands for some time. For a good many years there has been direct Communication-cation. between Ottawa and Washington, but the constantly increasing importance of Canadian interests in the United States have made it apparent that, in addition, Canada should be represented there in some distinctive manner, for this would doubtless tend to expedite negotiations, and naturally first-hand acquaintance with Canadian conditions would promote a good understanding. Id view of the peculiarly close relations that have always existed between the people of Canada .and those of the United States, it is also confidently expected that this new step will have the very desirable result of maintaining and strengthening the friendly relations and co-operation between the British Empire and the United States.Accordingly it has been agreed that His Majesty, on the advice of his Canadian Ministers, shall appoint a Minister Plenipotentiary who will have charge of Canadian affairs and conduct them direct with the United States Government, acting on instructions from, and reporting direct to, the Canadian Government. He will be accredited by His Majesty to the President with the necessary powers for the purpose. In order to preserve the closest connexion between him and the Ambassador, the Canadian representative will be part of the establishment of the Embassy, so that there may be constant interchange of views on matters of common concern. To this end also the Canadian Minister will reside and have his office within the precincts of the Embassy, and his Canadian staff, appointed like himself on the advice of the Canadian Ministry, will have diplomatic status and be regarded as part of the diplomatic staff of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, with rank equivalent to that of their British colleagues of corresponding rank. In the absence of the Ambassador the Canadian Alinister will take charge of the whole of the Embassy and of the representation of Imperial as well as of Canadian interests.As the present Embassy is not adequate for the purpose, it will be necessary to find another site on which suitable buildings can be raised.It is understood that this arrangement will be regarded as open to review if experience should disclose any necessity for alteration.It need only be added, that in accordance with the usual rule in such matters, the United States Government has been consulted, and that it has given the proposal a cordial welcome.League of Nations. On 6th March the Governor-General of Canada informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that, owing to the difficulty of discussing the matter of the League of Nations by telegraphic correspondence, it had been decided to send an official of the Department of External Affairs to London to confer on the spot. Accordingly Mr. L. C. Christie, legal adviser to the Department, was sailing on 6th March from New York, and it was hoped that he would be put in touch with the appropriate authorities so that he might report to Ottawa as soon as possible.The Treaty with Turkey. On 5th March the Governor-General of Canada telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows: A great deal of interest in the Turkish treaty negotiations is being manifested in Canada, and since the treaty must be submitted to Parliament for approval my Ministers feel they should, be kept advised on the general outline of the proposed conditions of peace, especially those relating to territorial readjustments for the Armenians and to the control of the-Straits. At present they have little knowledge beyond what appears in the Press, and they would be glad to have a full report of the present position and of the proposals now under consideration.Sir Robert Borden. The Acting Prime Minister of the Dominion (Sir George Foster) announced in the House of Commons that if Sir Robert Borden continued to improve in health at the rate he had done up to the present, he would be in his place in Parliament within two months.Immigration.--The Director of Information announced on 10th March that during the month of January 2,089 immigrants had entered Canada from the British Isles.
* iReciprocitijwith British Honduras [B.E.R., xii., p. 6]. In regard to this matter the Governor-General of Canada reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 4th March that his Ministers had represented that on 25th January 1913 an Order in Council had been passed on the recommendation of the Minister of Trade and Commerce admitting British Honduras to the advantages of the Canadian preferential tariff, that a copy of this Order in Council had been furnished to the Administrator of the Government of British Honduras, together with a copy of the Canadian Customs tariff, and, that the Governor had also been: communicated, with in reference to the possibility, of a regular steamship communication between Canada and British Hond uras.International Telegraphic Uonferencc-^-Oa 9th March the following telegram was sent by the Governor-General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies :  The Government of Canada has been informed by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington that it is proposed to hold an international telegraphic conference at AVashington in May next; and my Ministers represent that inasmuch as at present proposed this conference is to include only representatives&quot; of the Allies and Associated Powers, Canada would not be entitled to direct representation. In the -wireless field.Canada occupies a prominent position, arid took a very important part in the last international radio conference, The importance of radio communication is -increasing and its international aspect is widening as its uses are extended. It would therefore appear desirable that representatives of Canada conversant with the radio situation should be included in the British Empire delegation to that conference ; and. my Ministers desire that the steps necessary to that end should be taken by His -Majesty&apos;s Government at an early date.-  : - AUSTRALIA.Emigration of ex-Serviee Men. On 10th March the Governor-General of Australia informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that it was understood that a large number of ex-service men were desirous of proceeding to Australia under the -Imperial oversea emigration scheme, but that the greatest difficulty was experienced in obtaining passages ; and added that he would be glad if the Secretary of State would make representations^ the Ministry of Shipping with a view to expediting the allotment of berths for these men.NEW ZEALAND.-League of Nations. On 5th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies received a telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand informing him that the Prime Minister of that Dominion had stated that, after careful consideration, the New Zealand Government had decided not to take any action at the present time in the direction of appointing a representative in London for League of Nations purposes.&apos;Meat On 10th March, the Governor-General of New Zealand sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : New Zealand producers are becoming increasingly anxious regarding the outlook for the Dominions frozen meat trade after the termination of the existing contract on 30th June next. This anxiety is accentuated by the delays occurring in the arrival of refrigerated shipping, the continued congestion of storage here, and the consequent apparent impossibility of having the New Zealand stores cleared to a reasonable extent before the next season opens. The Prime Minister has already asked the Board of Trade whether the Imperial Government woidd be &quot;willing to continue the purchase of export meat for another year, or failing that, at least to continue it until 31st December in order to enable the stocks of meat stored in New Zealand to be reduced as low as possible. No reply to this has been received, and in view of the growing urgency of the situation definite information on the points stated is requested at the earliest possible date. To this the Secretary of State replied on 13th March, saying that after careful consideration it had been decided that the meat contract could not be extended beyond 30th June next.
