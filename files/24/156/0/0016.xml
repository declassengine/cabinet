GREAT BRITAIN.The Labour Situation.-r-The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 21 st April 1920 : The question of wages continues to be the element of outstanding importance in the labour situation. Negotiations have been taking place with regard to the wage demands of miners, building trades operatives, railwaymen, tramwaymen, omnibus workers, clock workers, bakers, textile operatives, teachers, postal employees and many other classes of workers. In some instances, notably in the case of the miners,, a settlement has been reached. In other cases, negotiations are following a normal course, but the issues in such industries as, the railways and the cotton textile trade are of a serious and far-reaching nature. &apos;A revival of interest is being shown in various matters of importance apart from demands for increased wages. The question of the international affiliation of labour and Socialist bodies continues to arouse controversy, the necessity for a general staff for Labour.is again being emphasized, and the whole question of trade union organization is exciting discussion at labour meetings and in the Labour and Socialist Press. , &apos;COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.WEST INDIES.Trade Conference with Canada.-A trade conference will be held at Ottawa during May between delegates from the British West Indies and. others representing the Dominion of Canada.EAST AFRICA.Visit of the Belgian Colonial Minister. Telegraphing from Nairobi on 21st April, ReuteFs agent reported that the Belgian Colonial Minister had left for the Congo after having made a tour through East Africa and Uganda. Before leaving he expressed, his admiration for the progress which had been made in the development of the protectorates, both of which, he was fully convinced had a great future.UGANDA.   .Visit of the Belgian Colonial Minister.See above under &quot; East Africa.&quot;INDIA.Afghan Delegation-Oii I8th April the &quot;Viceroy reported [459 S.] the receipt-of. a telegram from Mr. Dobbs, Foreign Secretary, and head of the British Delegation, announcing that the first meeting of the conference had been held on 17th April. Mr. Dobbs went on to say that after certain formalities in which the mode of proceeding was decided, a discussion took place with the object of defining the matters regarding which either side desired explanations. It was agreed that the following were the main preliminary points : On the side of the British Government: (1) The anti-British sentiment and unrest among our tribes provoked by the &apos;\ Afghans.(2) The apparent willingness of Afghanistan to assist the Bolsheviks by allowing . them a passage among our tribes, -and into India for the dissemination of anti-British propaganda. *
On the side of the Afghan Government:  &apos;&apos;(I) The attitude of the British Government concerning the Caliphate question and Turkey, which the Afghan delegates assert are matters of the deepestinterest to them and to neighbouring Mohamedan nations. (2) The action contemplated by the British Government as regards the Pathantribes on the British side of the frontier, (3) The actual views of the British Government as to the independent status d Afghanistan.An important statement was made by the Afghan Foreign Minister, Mahmud Tarsi, to the effect that the desire of Afghanistan \yas to depart from her policy of isolation, and to permit freedom of intercourse between other nations and herself.[468 S.] Mr. Dobbs reported on 19th April that at the meeting held that clay the-main subject of discussion had been the views of the British Government as to the national status of Afghanistan, which the Afghans considered fundamental for the successful clearance of misunderstandings. Their first point was whether Grant&apos;s letter conceding freedom of foreign relations was held to be as binding as the actual peace treaty. To this Mr. Dobbs assented. The second point was their desire for Afghan representation at the Court of St. James&apos;. To this Mr. Dobbs replied that the question could not even be discussed until the British Government were satisfied of the sincerity of Afghanistan&apos;s desire for our friendship. The third point was whether Afghanistan was free to send her representatives to other States. To this Mr. Dobbs said there was no objection if other States liked to receive them.[474 8.] At the following day&apos;s sitting, 20th April, Mr. Dobbs reported the presentation by the Afghan delegates of a statement of the points on which they felt concerned under the subject discussed the previous day.   Briefly these were (a) Absence of a reply to the AmiPs letters to the King. (6) The non-publication of Grant&apos;s letter.(e) Tlie intimation that the function of the Afghan envoy was unaltered, leading to the surmise that no change of status was admitted.(d) Afghan expectation that by permitting the sending of a Minister to London,and Consuls and Vice-Consuls to other places, the change of status would be marked.(e) Two of the conditions named by Grant were not consistent with the complete independence of Afghanistan. (/) Failure to accord to the Amir the title of &quot; His Majesty.&quot;Mr. Dobbs explained, that for our own interest and for the defence&quot; of India the root principle of our policy for a hundred years must have been to. maintain a strong and independent Afghanistan with friendly feelings towards Great Britain. This statement appeared to convey a great impression, and Mr. Dobbs proceeded to meet the first two points put forward by the Afghans. He reported that the Afghan-delegates were most friendly and temperate in their attitude.[482 S.] Mr. Dobbs reported that the discussion of the remaining points was resumed the next clay, 22nd April, in which the points (e) and (d) referred to above were disposed of.On 23rd April the Viceroy telegraphed [485 S.] the text of messages which had been exchanged between himself and Mr. Dobbs. In the first the Viceroy expressed his concern at the reported incidents of Afghan raiding on the frontier, at Chaman and Tandisar, especially at that particular juncture. He requested Mr. Dobbs to discuss the matter with Mahmud Tarsi, and to point out the difficulty of removing misunderstandings when such things were allowed to occur. The Tandisar incident looked as if the parry in Afghanistan, which was opposed to British friendship, was trying to hamper friendly proceedings, and Tarsi was to be asked to request the Amir to issue such orders as would prevent a recurrence of these disturbing incidents.In reply, Mr. Dobbs reported that he had acted on the Viceroy&apos;s instructions,, and that Tarsi had undertaken to communicate with the Amir in the required sense.Following on the above, the Viceroy reported [493 S.] on 26th April, that a further unprovoked attack by a force of 500 regular and irregular Afghan troops, with two guns, had been made on 23rd April on Lambabat, a place in the Chitral territory well within our frontier. Mr. Dobbs had sent Sir Abdul Qajyum, of the British delegation, to remonstrate with Tarsi, and to tell him that such unprovoked aggression
prohibited the continuance of friendly discussion. Tarsi had expressed his surprise and ignorance of all these incidents, but Sir Abdul discovered the Afghan delegates in the act of signing a letter to Mr. Dobbs, stating that unless satisfactory assurances regarding the future were forthcoming, with a cessation of punishment of the tribes, they on their part must discontinue the present conversations. In consequence of this, the Conference had been temporarily suspended, and while Tarsi had telegraphed to the Amir to ascertain what explanation he could give, Mr. Dobbs had gone to Simla to consult the Government. as to the future course of action. The Viceroy awaited&quot; information as to the Amir&apos;s reply, and details as to the Afghan incursion into Chitral, for a further communication.The Caliphate Question [B:E.R., xy., p. 3]. Under date of 16th April the Viceroy in his weekly telegram continued the reports from various districts of the Caliphate agitation and its consequences. On the one hand the violence of the agitation and of the language used in speeches delivered at protest meetings appeared to have increased, and the younger men of the extreme party were calling for deeds instead of the passive policy adopted under Gandhi&apos;s scheme. On the other hand there were not wanting indications that some of the moderate leaders were becoming alarmed at the lengths to which the violence of the language might be carrying them.The National Week from 6th April to 13th April had passed off without untoward incident. Reports for .13th had not then been received, but, so far as was known, Hartal had been little observed. Local Governments had been asked for a full appreciation of the situation as affected by the demonstrations of the past week, and a report of the result was promised in the following week&apos;s telegram. It was interesting to note the lead given by the rulers of States in connexion with the Caliphate agitation. Roar Sahib of Benares protested strongly against the continued observance of Hartals, which caused loss and suffering to the poorer classes of the population, and urged that the continuance of this method of expressing disapproval should be abandoned. Similarly, the Nizam of Hyderabad, while not prohibiting meetings in connexion with the Caliphate agitation, had published orders to the effect that permission should be obtained beforehand to hold meetings, and that copies of the resolutions proposed to be passed should be forwarded to his Government, and a record of proceedings should be deposited afterwards. On a smaller scale the Nawab of Rampur had taken similar steps. As far as could be gathered, the week fell flat.It was reported that the second batch of the Caliphate deputation, consisting of Hindu and Moslem leaders and representative members of Council, was shortly sailing for Europe. The original intention was to send Gandhi also, but the latest Press report stated that he would not go. He had cabled to the Viceroy personally on the 13th for permission and approval to undertake the mission of explaining to British statesmen and the public the dire consequences of an unfair settlement of the Turkish question. Shadi Lal&apos;s appointment as Chief Justice of the Punjab had been hailed with approval in the Press, and had had an excellent political effect. Lord Sinha had. given a powerful lead to the moderates in a speech he had addressed at the farewell dinner at Calcutta on 7th April. After paying tribute to the unicpie services rendered by leaders of the moderate party in England, he had pointed out the fundamental difference between the- moderate and extremist parties, and had indicated the impossibility of co-operation of the moderates with the extremists.The Yiceroy&apos;s telegram of the following week, dated 23rd April, supplied the following report: In last week&apos;s telegram we stated that we would send a full report of the situation as to the effect of Hartal and other demonstrations of the week of 6th to 13th April. We asked Local Governments in particular to inform us as to the extent to which the preaching of the contingent boycott of service has been successful, whether any serious trouble was anticipated in this respect on the announcement of the Turkish peace terms as recently outlined by the Prime Minister in reply to the Caliphate deputation, whether Local Governments advised taking active measures to stop the further progress of the agitation where exceeding constitutional limits to a dangerous extent, and lastly, whether agitators &quot;have attempted to disseminate seditious literature among Indian troops or to shake the loyalty of the police. We give a summary of the replies from Local Govern-meiits together with our general appreciation of the situation :--
. Punjab. Numerous meetings were held during the week and resolutions were passed according to Gandhi&apos;s programme. A noticeable feature was the participation of women and the rural classes. Funds were collected for the Jallianwala memorial, but, there were no Hartal and no disturbances. The Calcutta resolutions of con-tingent disloyalty were not taken seriously and met with a certain amount of active opposition from the Hindus. There was no attempt on the part of the Mohamedan Government servants to absent themselves from duty, and except in two instances no case of men leaving the Government service on account of the Caliphate question. No direct attempts have been made to tamper with the troops. The Prime MinisteFs reply to the Moslem deputation was received with more equanimity than had been expected. There was much soreness in Moslem circles naturally, and it was impossible to forecast the attitude&apos; of the people as regards the ultimate peace terms, but at present an outburst of violence was not expected. The agitation since the Royal Proclamation has been characterized by great vituperative violence instead of the previous attitude of sullen silence, and this license of speech may have a dangerous reaction on the rural areas, but the Press has not, as a rule, supported the more violent eccentricities of the platform, and. the general feeling, even in towns like Amritsar, is reported to be better than in. March 1919. Remarkably small attention is paid to the Congress report. At present nothing-can be gained by fresh declarations or a change of policy. The people at large are reaping an excellent harvest and are contented.Bombay. There was no Hartal anywhere during the National Week. The meetings held were purely of a formal nature to pass the resolutions framed by Gandhi. The preaching of contingent non-co-operation, and the circulation of seditious Caliphate literature in the Presidency, had no effect on Government servants, including the police. The private Caliphate. Conference recently held at Bombay advocated agitation for a further two months, to be followed after the publication of the peace terms by a policy of non-co-operation in gradual stages, namely :   (1) the relinquish--merit of titles ; (2) the resignation of membership of the Council ; (3) the resignation of service (a) private, (I)) subordinate official, (c) superior official, (d) military ; (4) the refusal to pay taxes. This is according to the plan of Gandhi, who has, however, made the absence of violence an essential condition. The boycott has been dropped, and there are decided indications of a movement towards more constitutional methods of agitation. The publication of the terms of peace is not likely to cause violent outbursts, but a chorus of disapproval may be expected. No general measures of a repressive nature are recommended. The Governor of Bombay recommends the publication of a full explanatory statement along, with the peace terms when announced.United Provinces.The week attracted little attention among any class of people, and no attention among the mass of people. The Hindus are afraid of the policy of withdrawing co-operation from the Government in the event of the Turkish peace terms not satisfying Mohamedan opinion ; e.g., in Cawnpore, they would go no further than saying that an adverse decision would cause unrest, and at Benares that, it would enfeeble the sentiment of co-operation with the British Government. In other places there is a similar reluctance among the Hindus to commit themselves. At a meeting of Ulema held at Cawnpore on 4th and f)th April, the resolutions passed exceeded in violence those adopted in Calcutta, but with certain exceptions, which the Local Government is considering with a view to action, the speeches were more moderate than the resolutions. Despite the active propaganda and the excitable language used, the course of events during the last few weeks is on the whole milder than previously. There is bitter criticism by the Press of the occupation of Constantinople, but little stir is caused among the people by this news. Interest in reforms is increasing.Bihar and Orissa. The National Week in Bihar and Orissa was a complete failure, and a great disappointment to its organizers. Practically no public interest was aroused, and the people generally are growing weary of demonstrations with no tangible results. The contingent boycott of Government service was not preached, and there is no reason to apprehend serious trouble in this respect on the publication of the peace terms.. Violent speaking and objectionable resolutions prevail, but the agitation shows signs of dying out if left alone. No active measures are necessary to stop its progress. There is no trace of the dissemination of seditious literature among the troops or the police, and no attempts are known to have been made to shake the loyalty of the police. If made, they were entirely unsuccessful. There is a growing 15-4 B
feeling that the past violence of speeches has done more harm than good, and attempts are being made to explain away the resolutions and to assert the underlying loyally of the participators.Delhi. The National Week evoked little interest, and the idea of holding further Hartals was rejected promptly by the shopkeepers. The agitation appears to have lost ground by the attempt to sustain interest in these subjects for so long a period as a week. The violence of Press and platform utterances, however, has increased, and no counsels of moderation are heeded. -There is considerable enthusiasm for the Swadeshi doctrine, and Ajmal Khans action in asking to be relieved of his titles is: praised by the extremists, although it is deplored by more reasonable people. The-contingent boycott of service has not been preached or discussed so far. The danger of. individual (corrupt group) being carried away by the excitement of the agitation remains, but any chance of a general upheaval appears remote. The meeting of so-called workers organized for the 1.9th April by minor Caliphate agitators, for those who prefer deeds to words, will show whether further measures are necessary. (Note. We have just received a brief C.I.D. report that this meeting was attended by 2,000 persons including delegates from the United Provinces and the Punjab ; that no prominent leaders, such as Ajmal Khan or Ansari, were present; that a Jehad and a Hijrat were openly advocated, and that very violent speeches were made. Fuller reports are awaited.)Bengal. The week from 6th to 13th was not observed in any way except for a few minor meetings in Calcutta on the 6th and 13th. To all outward appearances the excitement engendered.by the violent campaign at the end of February has died down. The announcement of the Turkish peace terms will certainly cause a recrudescence of the excitement, but unless religious fanaticism is fanned from outside Bengal there is no reason to anticipate serious disorder. Passive resistance, in the forms advocated by Gandhi is not likely to secure any hold in this province it&apos; left to itself. The clanger lies in attempts to kindle Mobamedan fanaticism by a succession of violent speeches by delegates from other provinces, or by village propaganda carried on by religious emissaries from elsewhere. Without a fuller knowledge of the plans of the inner ring of All-India agitators, it is difficult to forecast the future line of action, but the Government propose to watch carefully the Mohamedan Press, which has already been warned, and to take action under the Press Act if necessary. In the event of a further campaign of violent speeches by agitators coming from outside, including Abul Kalam Azad, it will be necessary to consider their externment from Bengal and the internment of Bengal leaders. Minor fanatics are being dealt with under section 108a, Code of Criminal Procedure.&apos; High prices continue to cause general discontent, but no attempts have been made to embarrass the Government&apos; by threats of a strike among Government servants, or Indian students, of a non-co-operative policy. There are no attempts to agitate among the troops. The extremists have also failed to get at the police, whose grievances in the matter of pay are receiving the sympathetic consideration of the Local Government.Assam. The Caliphate agitation has been kept within reasonable bounds in the Surma Valley, and in the Assam Valley is fainthearted throughout. Attempts to instigate the contingent boycott of Government service have met with no success, and all classes of Government servants, including the police, are believed to be loyal and unaffected by the agitation.   No active measures are at present called for.Burma. The Hartal, and similar demonstrations, are entirely confined to Rangoon and Mandalay, and to all appearances the artificial public sentiment is not being stirred. There is no indication of the boycott of Government service, and no likelihood of serious trouble on the announcement of the Turkish peace terms,mnless the news of disturbances in India produces a similar effect in Burma. No active measures of repression are considered necessary. The loyalty of the Indian police  military and civil is reported to be unshaken, and there is no reason to believe that the dissemination of seditious literature among the Indian troops has taken place.Central Provinces-^ few poorly attended meetings were held at Nagpur, but the interest in the Turkish question is waning.- The Prime Minister&apos;s reply to the deputation has had a sobering effect. There are no attempts to tamper with the loyalty of the police or the Indian troops, The doctrine of contingent disloyalty has made little impression on Government servants. The announcement of the peace terms may cause excitement in a few Mohamedan centres, but no serious trouble is
-anticipated. No special measures are needed at present to stop the further progress of the agitation.Madras. The Report has not yet been received, but a Press message shows a violent speecli to have been made by Shaukat Ali at the Caliphate Conference of 17thApril.&quot;        &apos; . .     ,On the whole our appreciation of the general situation may be summarized asfollows : The situation is more reassuring, and violent language is defeating itself, especially as regards the sympathy of Hindus, who are openly dissociating themselves from the movement. Moderate Mohammedans hold similar views, but are afraid to express them. The National Week has been a failure on the whole, and there is little evidence that the policy of non-co-operation, will be generally accepted, but we are carefully watching developments, as there is an underground movement regarding which we have little information as yet, and we do net know how far associations of workers, like that held at Delhi, may find favour with the fanatically minded. Reports from particular places, especially Sind, are disquieting, ancl we have made special -enquiries from the Local Government. Another clanger which we have just had brought to notice is that the Afghan delegation, now sitting at Mussoorie, may attempt to get into relations with the Caliphate agitators, and serve as a connecting link with the pan-Islam movement outside India. On. the whole, our policy of abstention from interference has so far been justified, and will be continued as far as possible, in order to avoid making martyrs or precipitating disorder which certain of the extremists want. Should action be necessary we should prefer recourse to the ordinary law rather than executive action, but preventive measures may, of course, be necessary to prevent outbursts of local disorder. Local Governments will be asked to maintain lists of the principal agitators against whom steps should be taken in case of emergency. We do not anticipate organized disorder on the announcement of the Turkish peace terms, but local outbreaks, and also individual acts of fanaticism. Expedition and decisive action in that contingency would be imperative.Tilak issued a manifesto of 20th April outlining the programme of the Congress of the democratic party emphasizing unswerving loyalty to the Congress ancl faith in democratic principles. Striving, with the help of the Labour Party in Parliament, to establish, an early responsible government, co-operating or obstructing, whichever might be expedient, strongly supporting the Caliphate question, trying for the repeal -of repressive legislation, promoting the Swadeshi movement, assisting the development of Indian industries, urging the nationalization of railways, the retrenchment of military expenditure, the creation of a citizen army, the establishment of a national -lingua franca, the promotion of Hindu Mohamedau unity, the readjustment of the province on a linguistic basis. In the provincial domain the party pledged itself to many useful reforms, as the extension of franchise without severe disability, a permanent ryotwari settlement. On this programme- the extremist party will appeal to the electorates in the coming elections. The manifesto, as thus outlined in the Press telegram, is a clever document with its appeal in the last sentence to rural populations.There is considerable discontent among the Sikhs regarding their representation as to new Councils. We believe their claims are unreasonable, and cannot be supported, but regard it as unfortunate that a bitter feeling should be provoked against the Government over such a question at this juncture. The non-Brahmins are also very sore over Mestou&apos;s award.Lord Sinha&apos;s speech continues to be bitterly attacked by the extremist Press, but he is defended by the moderate papers.THE DOMINIONS.International Financial Conference. The Secretary of State for the Colonies transmitted the following message from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to the Officer Administering the Government of Canada, ancl to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, on 17th April: -
sGovernment should forward to the  Secretary-The Council of the League of Nations begs to inform  (1) The Canadian &quot;A(2) The Commonwealth of Australia ln , ,     . ,, , ,.      ,(3) The New Zealand ( Government of the following resolution adopted(4) The Union of South Africa        ) ,during the meetings of the Council held in London llth-13th February 1920: Article 1. The League of Nations shall convene an International Conference-with a view to studying the financial crisis and look for means remedying it and mitigating the dangerous consequences arising from it.Article 2. A commission composed of members of the Council nominated by the President, shall be instructed to summon the States chiefly concerned to this Conference and to convene it at the earliest possible date.This Conference will be held at Brussels about the end of May 1920.The Council therefore has the honour to invite  the Canadian 7)the Commonwealth of Australia (,-, , ,        .-,     ri   .xt    r?  i    i rGovernment   to send   to   the  Conference  notthe New Zealand Ithe Union of South Africa        )more than three delegates conversant with public finance and banking, as well as with general economic questions. The Council requests that the names of these delegates may be notified to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations., The Council will nominate the President of the Conference and will supply the necessary personnel for the secretariat. The exact date of the meeting will be announced by the Secretary-General.The Council suggests that, in order to facilitate preparations for the Conference,, the Canadianthe Commonwealth of Australia the New Zealand the Union of South Africa General as soon as possible any suggestions for dealing with present financial difficulties which it may desire to submit to. the Conference, together with a statement indicating any steps it may have taken for dealing with the situation.It is suggested that the general expenses in connexion, with the organization of the Financial Conference should be met by the League of Nations, and the expenses and salaries of the delegations by their respective Governments.In reply to this the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 24th April, asking him to communicate the following to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations : The -Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is pleased to accept- the invitation of the Council of the League of Nations to be represented at an International Conference at-Brussels, for the study of the financial crisis. The Right Honourable AY. A. Watt, Commonwealth Treasurer, now en route to England, will represent Australia at the Conference. Steps are being taken to meet the Councils desire that in order to facilitate preparation for the Conference any suggestions for dealing with the present financial difficulties be communicated to the Secretary-General without delay.Arms Traffic Convention. On 9th April the Secretary of State for the Colonies, telegraphed to the Officer Administering the Government of Canada, to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand and -South Africa, and to the Governor of Newfoundland, saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been informed by the United States Government that, pending the ratification of the Arms Traffic Convention, they had no power to prevent private firms in the United States from shipping arms, &amp;c, to non-signatory States. Also that, with the sole exception of Venezuela,, no neutral Government had given a guarantee to sign when the opportunity was afforded. Consequently, exporters in the United Kingdom and other principal signatory States were placed at a serious disadvantage as compared with traders in the United States.Li these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government had suggested to the -Governments of France, Italy, Belgium, and Japan, that for the present the Arms Convention should be held to apply only to small-bore arms and. ammunition, and to bombs, as was originally proposed. The chief obstacles to legitimate trade with civilized countries would be thus removed, while the most important feature of the
Convention would be retained, namely, tbe prohibition of export to prohibited zones of arms, &amp;c, likely to be used by turbulent tribes.Officers and Men of the Royal Navy serving in the Dominions [B.E.R., xy., p. 4].  On 15th April the Officer Administering&apos; the Government of Canada informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Government, concurred in the pro-posed Bill dealing with - the legal position of officers and men of the Royal Navy serving in Dominion Navies.On 20th April the Governor-General of New Zealand reported that his Ministers concurred in the suggestions contained in the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 1st April. They, however, wished to point out that it was understood that the telegram referred principally to matters of discipline and service and would not affect financial questions, such as pensions or compensation to officers and men lent to or taking passage in Dominion vessels who might be incapacitated during such service as the result of hurts&apos;or sickness.And on 16th April the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies saying that his Ministers had no objection to the provisions of the Bill regarding the relations of the Royal Navy and the Naval Forces of the Dominions. They pointed out that, under the provisions of the South Africa Defence Act, 1913, officers and other ranks of the Royal Navy employed with the South African division of the Royal Navy Reserve remained subject to the&apos;Naval Discipline Acts.Trade Conference with the West Indies. See above under &quot; Colonies, &amp;o.&quot;Treaty with Bulgaria. The Director of Information announced, on 14th April, that an Order in Council had been passed requesting his Majesty the King td ratify the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria on behalf of the Dominion of Canada.Business Conditions.- According to a telegram sent by the Director of Information on 21st April, business generally continued good throughout Canada. The bank clearings during the second week in April were 33 per cent, in excess of those for the corresponding period last year.Canadian Jews and &apos;Palestine.-On 22nd April the Officer Administering the Government of Canada reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that repre-seutatives of the Canadian Jewish Congress, which represented the Jewish people in Canada, had approached the Government of Canada and expressed a desire to associate themselves with their co-religionists in. other parts of the world in urging that, in the settlement of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be made mandatory for Palestine; and had expressed their complete confidence that His Majesty&apos;s Government, if made mandatory, would give full effect to the declaration made by Mr. Balfour on 2nd November 1917 to the effect that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government viewed with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and would use every endeavour to facilitate the achieve-ment of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing would be clone which might, prejudice the civil or religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&quot; The Government of Canada shared their hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be appointed mandatory for Palestine.Proposed Meetings of Flag Officers. On 22nd April the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in reply to a despatch dated 18th February regarding an Admiralty proposal that Mag Officers should meet at Singapore occasionally, saying that his Ministers concurred in the suggestion that those of the East Indies and China Squadrons, together with the Flag Officer in Australia, should meet yearly or biennially.Proposed German Consulate in Sydney. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governor-General on 3rd April that a note had been received from the 15-4 CCANADA.AUSTRALIA.
German Charge d&apos;Affaires stating that the German Government intended shortly to establish consular representatives at Sydney, Capetown and Montreal, and that it was proposed to reply that there was no objection in principle to the re-establishment of. these consulates, and to ask to whom the German Government proposed to entrust the appointments.Lord Milner asked whether the Australian Ministers saw any objection, adding that they would of course be consulted before any individual was accepted, and that, in the event of the German Government selecting officers who were not acceptable, they would be asked to nominate other persons for approval.To this Sir Ronald Munro-Ferguson replied on 3rd April that the Commonwealth Government considered that no good purpose would be served by German Consuls in Australia, as it was not proposed to buy goods from Germany, and a German Consul would be only a German spy. His Ministers would be glad to learn the attitude of the Government of France in regard to this question.Resumption of Trade with Germany. On 15th April the Secretary of State for the Colonies replied to the telegram in regard to the selling of horses to Germany [B.E.R., xiv., p. 9] sent by the Governor-General on 23rd March, saying that in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it was not desirable in the interest of the Allies to place any obstacles in the way of resumption of trade with Germany, the revival of which was considered essential to enable her to discharge her reparation obliga-tious, and that, in these circumstances, His Majesty:s Government saw no objection to the exportation in question.In answer to this Sir Ronald Munro-Ferguson informed the Secretary of State on 24th April that the Commonwealth Government wouldv permit exports to Germany after specific approval, but that importation from Germany was prohibited.Meat. On 19th April the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies transmitting the following message from his Prime Minister : The inability to indicate even approximately the actual date of the termination of the Australian meat contracts is causing the gravest anxiety and concern here, and is seriously prejudicing the prospects of the Australian meat industry. Producers are daily pressing for relief from the unfair position in which they now find themselves. The uncertainty as to when open market conditions are likely to be reverted to prevents their entering into arrangements for the disposal of their products. In this respect Australia is placed at a serious disadvantage as compared with the Argentine and New Zealand. During the&apos;-war, Australia supplied her meat and other great stable products below the world&apos;s prices, and while war conditions lasted was willing to continue to do so, but is now entitled to at least equal treatment with the other Dominions and with foreign countries.
