The Special Heater Service. On 24th June the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Governors of the Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, and Nyasaland, the Officers Administering the Governments of Ceylon, Malta, the East Africa. Protectorate and Uganda, and the Acting Resident at Zanzibar, saying, with reference to his telegram of 25th March, that it was proposed to continue the special Reuter service for a further three months from 1st July on the existing conditions, and that it was presumed that this arrangement would be acceptable. By 30th September the contributions to the service on the part of the Dominions and the Colonies would have been in operation for a year, ancl with a view to considering the question of continuance after that date, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to be furnished by telegraph, if possible by the middle of August, with the views of their Governments, first, as to the extent to which the service had been utilized by newspapers ancl the degree of prominence given; secondly, as to its value from the Imperial point of view; and thirdly, as to their willingness or otherwise to continue to contribute.RHODESIA.Native Policy. ReutePs agent telegraphed from Salisbury (Rhodesia) on 22nd J une as follows: With reference to the reply of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society in the Times of 16th June to a letter from the Bishop of Rhodesia of 11th June, in which the Bishop defends the policy of the British Government towards the natives in his diocese, it is pointed out here, that there are no differences between the Administration and the elected members of the Legislature on questions of native policy. As a matter of fact, members generally in the discussion of the vote for the Native Affairs Department recognized the satisfactory character of native administration,EGYPT.The Wheat Situation and the Cotton Supply [B.E.R., xx., p. 2]. Telegraphing on 29th June Lord Curzon replied to Lord AUenby&apos;s message of 20th June [No. 605] as follows [No. 583]: The Wheat Commission cannot give any undertaking to provide Egypt with 300,000 tons of wheat during the year ending May 1922 ; but the Commis-sion state that they have gpod reason to hope that supplies will be forthcoming, and as long as they continue to function they will do their best to help Webb to obtain his requirements.In view of these assurances it is hoped that the reduction of the cotton area will not be such as to preclude the possibility of obtaining at least a f) .-million kantar crop. The Board of Trade regard any reduction with the gravest misgiving as the British cotton industry is absolutely dependent on the Egyptian crop for the finer grades of cotton, and, whilst recognizing that some reduction is inevitable, urge that it should be kept as small as possible.The Bomb Outrages. On 27th June Lord Allenby reported [No. 622] that, as the result, of investigations ordered by himself, he had now been advised by competent authorities that the bomb attacks on Ministers were the outcome of an organized conspiracy, of which Abdul Rahman Fahmi was the ringleader. He had ordered his arrest, ancl, unless he were instructed to the contrary, should perquisition his house. The evidence to hand showed that Zaghloul and the local Zaghloulist Committee- had strongly opposed the methods adopted by the &quot; Revenge Society &quot; with which Abdul. Rahman had identified himself.In another telegram [No. 659], sent on 5th July, Lord Allenby said that at least. 50 other persons would be tried with Abdul Rahman on a charge of attempting to overthrow the Government by various methods, such as incitements to murder the Sultan and his Ministers, actual attempts to murder the latter, and the distribution of firearms.
PALESTINE.Message for Emir Feisal.  On 24th June Lord Curzon instructed [No. 568] Lord Allenby to communicate the following message [No. 569] to Emir Eeisal if he - saw no objection :  .His Majesty&apos;s Government have the honour to inform your Highness that His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to appoint Sir Herbert Samuel to be High Commissioner and commander-ih-Ohief in Palestine, for the purpose of setting-up a civil administration to replace the existing military administration in that country. Sir Herbert Samuel is authorized to communicate with your Highness on all questions affecting his duties, and has been instructed to refer to His Majesty&apos;s GoVernment such local questions as your Highness may desire to raise. In view, however, of the close connexion between your Highness and Field-Marshal Lord Allenby, which dates from the time when your gallant troops co-operated with, him in freeing Syria and Palestine from Turkish rule, His Majesty&apos;s Government will always be ready to communicate with your Highness through him, when the occasion -arises.Protest against the Appointment of Sir Herbert Samuel. On 24th June General Hols reported&apos; from Jerusalem [No. 104] that a protest had been delivered by the Moslem-Christian Society protesting against the appointment of Sir Herbert Samuel -and saying that neither could the inhabitants recognize him, nor the Society accept any responsibility for disturbances of the peace. The appointment was regarded as the first step towards the formation of a national home for Zionists in the midst of the .Arab people.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xx., p. 3].--The Viceroy transmitted [759 S.] on 19th June a long telegram from Mr. Dobbs, in which the latter represented that, seeing that six months had gone by since the first proposals for the conference had been put forward, the primary objects of staving off possible hostilities during the hot weather, and of counteracting the ill effects of the Caliphate agitation on Afghan minds, had been attained. He was strongly of opinion that the time had come, under the changed conditions, to define clearly what we expected from Afghanistan, and what we were prepared to do for Afghanistan, including an explicit statement regarding subsidy. He begged, therefore, that the policy of the conference might be reconsidered.The Viceroy called attention to the amir&apos;s evident and desperate need of ready money. He gave general support to Mr. Dobbs&apos; belief that if we were prepared to state definitely to the Aghans what help we were ready to give, they would undertake -on their side to refrain from intrigues with our frontier tribes, to prevent Kabul being used as a centre of activity by Indian revolutionaries, and to block the passage of Bolshevik propaganda to India. The view of the Government of India was that in the changed circumstances it would be unwise to insist on a further period of probation, and. that they should be authorized to make a clear statement of what they were prepared to give the Afghans in the shape of a subsidy in return for the action required of them.   The Viceroy asked for instructions.A further telegram from Mr. Dobbs was transmitted [773 SJ by the Viceroy on 24th June, in which it was stated that, after a long discussion on Afghan instigation of our frontier tribes, the Afghan delegates had assured Mr. Dobbs that if the outcome of the conference was friendship there would be no further cause for complaint in that respect. Mr. Dobbs added that Tarsi had evinced considerable impatience to return to Kabul in order to regain his personal influence there, and he feared it would be difficult to retain him at Mussoorie much longer.On the following day the Viceroy transmitted [783 S.] the information received from Mr. Dobbs, that he had announced to the Afghan delegates what were our intentions regarding the Mahsud country. The announcement evidently perturbed them, but Mr. Dobbs did not anticipate any protest while they were in India, as they were impatiently awaiting a detailed statement of the benefits which we were prepared -to offer.
Before the receipt of the last two messages the Secretary of State telegraphed&apos; [P. 4838] on 24th June to the Viceroy, in reply to his request contained in his-telegram [759 S.]. - lie understood that authority was required for the payment of a -subsidy of 18 lakhs in return for satisfactory assurances regarding the cessation of incitation of the tribes, the denial of shelter for hostile influences, and the-non-encouragement of Indian agitators. The Secretary of State recognized the change in the situation, and, on the understanding that the treaty would contain a provision making the continued payment of the subsidy conditional on the &quot;fulfilment -of the undertakings indicated above, he sanctioned the proposal put forward by the Viceroy, subject to being satisfied on two points. These were (.1) the situation that would arise if our bid for Afghan friendship were not large enough, and the Amir should make it an occasion for bargaining with the Bolsheviks, and then raising &quot;his terms to us ; and (2) the desirability of obtaining control of foreign, relations in return for the subsidy, with the possibility of a loan and treaty on the lines of the Anglo-Persian agreement.In his reply [788 S.] despatched on 27th June the Viceroy was able to satisfy the Secretary of State that point&apos;(1) was unlikely to arise, and that if it did, the situation would be no worse than it would be if we refused to state our terms now; and on point (2) that there was no prospect of the Afghans consenting formally to our control of their foreign relations, although if friendship were established, it was not unlikely that in practice they would consult us freely; and that a loan would he-unacceptable to the Afghans, for fear that their inability to pay might be made a pretext for our interference in their internal affairs. The Viceroy transmitted also-Mr. Dobbs&apos; report that the Afghan delegates were being pressed from Kabul to return without delay, and were showing great impatience.On 29th June the Secretary of State informed the Viceroy that his views had been,accepted, and authorized him to act accordingly.The Vicerot/s Weekly Reports. The Viceroy&apos;s weekly reports for 19th and 2 6th-June were as follows :-I. (19th June.) -The Hunter Report is still the main topic of discussion, and the-publications of the extremists, both European and Indian, exacerbate racial feeling and are calculated to prejudice the position of the moderates, though the latter condemn the Report too. At the Council meeting of the National Liberal Federation, of India, under the presidency of Surandranath Banerji, resolutions were passed expressing disappointment at the conclusions of the Majority Report, urging the-punishment of officers who gravely abused power, expressing disappointment at the wholly inadequate punishment of General Dyer, condemning the encomium paid to-Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer, and pressing for a stronger mark of disapprobation. It is reported from the Punjab that the educated classes in general disapprove of the findings of the Majority Report, though the effect of its publication is said to have been good on the more sober minded, and that of your&apos; despatch has already been beneficial. But the Tribune and other Punjab papers favour the idea of further agitation to secure justice for the people in connexion with the disturbances. Dissatisfaction is expressed at Mr. Thompsons returning as Chief Secretary.2. Further reports of proceedings at Allahabad show that: (i) The public meeting was of no importance and was only held to gratify local curiosity, (ii) The conference of Ulema declared hijrat to be optional and not obligatory, (iii) At the first meeting-of the Central Caliphate Committee high feeling was displayed at the views of the Congress Committee in regard to non-co-operation, Abdul Bari accusing the Hindus of playing with the Mohamedans. (iv) At the first meeting of the Hindu-Moslem leaders, Moti Lai Nehru and Malaviya made it clear that they were not convinced of the practicability of non-co-operation or of the need of the whole programme outlined,, and that they wanted to consider the question more fully. Shaukat Ah demanded an immediate decision, (v) At the second joint meeting, Sind and Madras were declared to be ripe for action, but not Bengal. The extremist Moslem leaders advocated the joining any Afghan army that might invade India to drive out the British. The Hindu leaders demanded an explanation and made it clear that at the first sign of such a danger the Hindus would cease to co-operate and would actively oppose. Lajpat Rai emphasized the point that the question to Hindus was political,, not religious, and that Hindu help would be offered to Moslems only so far as the political betterment of the Indian nation was concerned:. and Gandhi assured his support as long as the Mohamedans did not adopt violent or other &quot; insane methods.&quot;&apos;
-On the subject of non-co-operation no linal decision was arrived at; the consideration of the special congress which should be held in Calcutta in August was awaited, (vi) The special features of the second meeting of the Central Caliphate Committee, apart from the resolutions reported last week, were Gandhi&apos;s assumption of a dictator-:ship and the Moslem leaders&apos; acquiescence ; Gandhi explained that if the Mobamedans wished to go beyond the four stages, he would stand aside and watch in silence. In the course of the proceedings the extremist policy was outlined thus : the main idea was never to give the British any rest, and to foster hatred of them among Mohamedans iu India and. throughout the world-to take full advantage of their preoccupations in Ireland, Mesopotamia and Afghanistan with the view of ultimately overthrowing- their power in the interests of Islam. The methods of achieving this to be (a) in India the winning over of the servants of the Government who are already discontented promoting discontent among the labouring classes and encouraging-unions ; (b) abroad to utilize Muhajiken to stir up trouble against Great Britain. -Only men useless in India to perform hijrat real workers to remain in India and no hijrat en masse.3.&apos; There are no signs &quot;that the extremist programme is being more favourably received -sober opinion, in spite of the very general bitter feelings excited by the iull text of the Turkish peace terms, now received in India, is against the policy outlined in the preceding paragraph, and the Hindu extremists will not accept it, -except as a political bargain on certain conditions. B. C. Pal&apos;s dream of the possibility of driving the British out of India in five years through Hindu-Moslem unity, is improbable of realization, as the extremist Mohamedans work for Islam and not for India. There are no fresh developments of the Caliphate agitation and non-co-operation movement.Proposals made seriatim were adopted, to the effect that Id should not be -celebrated this year, and the money spent on Id should be saved and contributed to the Caliphate fund, now running rather low. In some quarters Mohamedans complain that they are tired of subscriptions, and ignorant of the use to which they -are put, as no accounts are kept. Delhi is reported to have been more than ordinarily quiet during the past fortnight. The proceedings of the Allahabad, Conference are -almost untouched. The arrival of Maulana Mahhaj Hasan in Delhi caused no excitement,Punjab reports that more emigrants have proceeded to Afghanistan, ancl one Mohaniedan D.C. of that province writes: -&quot; Whatever may be the fate of the emigration movement, hijrat of men&apos;s minds towards Kabul has commenced.&quot; The movement itself received but little support. The National Liberal Federation has passed resolutions urging alteration of the peace terms with Turkey with a view -to the conciliation of Moslem sentiment, but at the same time strongly disapproving the &quot;mischievous movement&quot; of non-co-operation. The Nizam of Hyderabad has discontinued grants to the editor of Zamindar (Lahore) and his son for having taken part in politics and neglected the work entrusted to them by the Hyderabad Darbar -of the translation of the history of (? England).4. Generally speaking, the situation is not disquieting, but the efforts of fanatical Maulvis may cause trouble, and attempts to seduce the troops may meet with success, as there are signs of dissatisfaction in accordance with the spirit of the times, spreading somewhat in the Indian Army, and being encouraged by similar-dissatisfaction in the British regiments now stationed in India, which may react unfavourably on the Indian units. Reports have been received to the effect that some sepoys of the 53rd Sikhs and sowars of the 1.1th Lancers recently refused to receive pay on the ground of its inadequacy but they were eventually persuaded to take it. In another instance,. Pathan sepoys frequent the house of a Hindu who lectures on the Caliphate and. preaches that success depends on the efforts of the Mohamedan sepoys. We are-considering what measures are possible to counteract these influences. The grievances of certain British regiments, e.g., the Welch Fusiliers and the 8th Essex Regiment, which are due to the rate of exchange at which pay is drawn, are receiving the close -attention of the military authorities. The disturbance at Ranikhet was due to, the same dissatisfaction.5. Election activity continues unabated.   (? Bihar) reports that in. some consti-tueiicies even rival Congress men are seeking election, and that iu all constituencies where there is at present no Congress candidate, one will be rim.   In Bengal the -anti-landlord agitation continues, and rural seats will be fought against the repre-.sentatives of the Zamindars.18-115
6. The termination of the North-Western Railway strike is much appreciated ;: the public were gravely inconvenienced and much damage was done to trade, especially in Amritsar. But we have just received news that the strike has been renewed in the carriage and wagon department. The Railway Board is wiring-details of this to you. The employees of the railway workshops at Bibrugarh (Assam) struck work for a substantial increase in wages, but the strike was settled the same day by a promise of 25 per cent, rise, though some of the staff were out for 50 per cent.   There was no outside interference.7. The extremists in some parts of India intend to combine the discontent arising out. of the Hunter. Committee Report and the Caliphate to embarrass the Government.II. (26th June.) The Hunter Report still looms large in the Press. Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer&apos;s letter to The Times is severely criticized, and has evoked further bitter-ness. An Upper India report indicates that the feeling against the Majority Report is increasing ancl that it meets with general disapproval on account of the reported excesses of martial law officers and the recent action of the European Association and., the planters of Bihar. From Assam, however, we learn that there has so far been little or no comment on. the Report and despatches, ancl from the United Provinces-that the publication of the Report has caused no stir in the districts. There has been some criticism also of the Minority Report for its findings as to the Satyagraha move-ment. The resolutions of the Liberal Association, condemning the Majority Report, have been taken to indicate that there is little real difference between the Extremists-and the Moderates. We have in previous telegrams explained why the Moderates find, it necessary to take this line.2. The political situation generally has been quieter otherwise.From Madras it is reported that the Mohamedans in the districts are not in the-least interested in the political situation, One municipal councillor in a small town ancl an honorary magistrate in another have resigned office, but they are men of no-education and the action has gone unnoticed. Yakub Hassan&apos;s lead is not being followed. Many who promised douations to the Central Caliphate Committee under the spell of Shaukat AIi&apos;s eloquence now decline to pay, and dissensions are reported in the Committee itself. The Prince of Arcot, the leading Mohamedan in Madras, has kept aloof from the movement.-Bombay. The sub-committee appointed at Allahabad to work out the non-co-operation programme having assembled at Bombay, Gandhi was authorized to draft two letters to the Viceroy on. the subject of non-co-operation. The first of these,, signed by Moslems alone, gives notice that non-co-operation is to begin and calls-upon the Viceroy to join the movement; the second is a personal letter from Gandhi.These two documents were sent under the following covering letter from Gandhi:-I enclose herewith a representation signed by Moslem representatives and another by me, for submission to his Excellency. The Moslem representation does not bear the original signatures as it was circulated in different parts of India and the signatures were authorized by telegraph. Some of the signatures, are on soiled paper, but the authority in every case is in the possession of the Central Caliphate Committee.I do not wish to say anything about the representations, but will only express the hope that they will receive clue weight from his Excellency. The gist of the documents themselves is as follows : I. The Moslem representation : Para. 1. The signatories claim to represent the largest body of Moslem opinion. The Turkish peace terms have wounded the religious susceptibilities of all Moslems and are a violation of the obligations of the Sunnis as well as contrary to the pledges of British Ministers which secured the recruitment of Indian Moslems during the war.Para. 2. The Turkish Empire representing the Caliphate is &quot; treated by the British Empire in the same manner as a defeated enemy &quot; ; the just and reasonable sentiment of Indian Moslems should be taken into account: -(a) The idea of the punishment of the Sultan by curtailment of (?) temporalpower is intolerable.(b) The misrule of Turkey has not been proved, ancl a commission of enquiry is asked for.(c) The principle of self-determination is accepted.
Para. 3. The British Government should therefore be asked to secure a revision of the Turkish peace terms, and should be told that in the event of failing to do so the Viceroy will make common cause with the people of India even to the point of resignation, a course Avhich would have been adopted in similar circumstances by the Ministers of any self-governing Colony.Para. 4. Otherwise from 1st August next the policy of non-co-operation will be enforced, and both their co-religionists and the Hindus will be asked to join in the movement.Para. 5. This is not a threat. A claim to be loyal subjects of the Crown is put forward, but that is subservient to loyalty to Islam, and this enjoins resistance to those who would reduce the status of the Caliphate. &apos;Para. 6. They hope non-co-operation will not be necessary, but should it be, ever,&apos; effort will be made to avoid violence. Non-co-operation will be in progressive stages to ensure (a) the least possible dislike to Government, (b) the control of popular feeling.Of the 82 signatories, two are from the delegation, 12 from the United Provinces (representing six districts), 12 from Bombaj&apos;&apos;, 3 from. Bengal, 10 from. Bihar and Orissa (representing four districts), 3 from the Punjab, 45 from Madras, of whom 22 are from Trichinopoly; they consist mainly of lawyers and merchants, with seven honorary magistrates, of whom one is a retired deputy-collector. No one is a member of the Imperial or any Legislative Council, but there are four ex-members. With the exception of the extremists Abdul Bari, Hazrat Mohani, Shaukat Ali, Chotani, Yakub Hasan, Mazhayul Haq and Kitchlew, there is a noteworthy absence of well-known, names or names which carry weight in the provinces, but further signatures may be sent later.2. Gandhi&apos;s letter: (1) Explains his reason for associating himself with the Caliphate question. Early in the war, seeing how deeply the Mohamedans in India were moved by Turkey&apos;s entry into the war, he urged them to express their fears and hopes in a disciplined manner. During the war they behaved with restraint, and the turbulent sections were kept by the leaders under complete control.(2) The peace terms and the Government of India&apos;s defence were equally a shock to Mohameclan opinion ; and it is incumbent on staunch Hindus wishing to live on terms of close established friendship with Moslem countrymen to stand by them now. Both Hindus and Moslems have lost faith in British justice, and this feeling is aggravated by the Hunter Report and despatches.(3) The alternatives are either to sever connexion with British rule or to restore confidence by rectifying wrong. He, still retaining belief in the British constitution, accepts the latter course, and enjoins as a means of securing this end, the with-drawal of co-operation from the Government unless the Turkish terms are revised. The other possibility, violence or hijral, which at one time found favour with Mohamedans is deprecated on utilitarian grounds. The necessity of direct action is recognized, and the only Signified and constitutional form is non-co-operation, i.e., the right of the subject to refuse to assist a ruler who misrules. Grave risks are admitted, but the fear of risks now means graver risks to come involving the destruction of law or order.(4) Escape from non-co-operation is still possible by the Viceroy himself leading the Caliphate movement.The Bombay Chronicle advises the new committee to take no action pending the decision of the special congress which will probably be held in August. The occasion of Maulana Mahmud Hasan&apos;s arrival in Bombay was attempted to be utilized by Shaukat Ali and the Caliphate Committee for political purposes, but met with no particular success. He was presented with, an address urging him to lead the Caliphate agitation, and was given the title of Shaikh-ul-Hind, but reports from elsewhere show that he is likely to hold aloof from politics.Sind. A lull in the campaign of misrepresentation is reported, though two Mohamedans of the Upper Sind Frontier refused to pajr the land revenue on pro-Turkish grounds; recovery of the money by legal process was ordered. Similar refusals will be experienced elsewhere in Sincl, but the movement is not likely to be dangerous.Bengal. General uncertainty as to the desirability of continuing the propaganda prevails in Mofussil, and the leaders returned from the Allahabad conference have as yet given no useful lead.   There is no present sign that the conference has given any
impetus to the movement in Bengal or dissipated the general scepticism with which it is viewed- Bg- 25,000 were allotted to the Central Caliphate Committee, and the question of sending a secret mission to the Amir to extract a promise that Indian Moslems leaving India would he given various concessions facilitating their settlement in Afghanistan was discussed.but with no practical result. The efforts made to give the hijrat movement a footing in Bengal have so far been fruitless.The United Provinces report that all local Caliphate organizations in the-province were looking to the joint meeting for a. lead which it has failed to give.. The meeting is described as a complete fiasco.The majority of the Moslems present are reported to have favoured a cautious policy, though the extreme party by taunts and violence carried the day. In the result the meeting handed the lead wholly over to Gandhi, aided by a small committee on which the majority of the principal Moslems are not included. The general feeling in the province as the result of the meeting appears to be that the Caliphate meeting will effect little; but the surrender of Thrace to Greece, and the alleged broken pledges of the British Minister will rankle long with Moslems. The feeling of bitterness among the Moslems is increasing and the position of loyalists in some places is made difficult. There is no readiness yet on the part of the Moslems to surrender titles and honorary offices. Maulana Abul Khair of Ghazipur has been served with a notice that if he does not renounce his title of Shams-ul-ulama at once they will not pray behind him at Id. The attack is largely due to old enmities with Abdul Bail. It is understood that this has been met by the substitution of Maulana&apos;s son as leader of prayers.The Central Provinces report that Shaukat Ali, passing through Nagpur recently, declared that since the Allahabad Caliphate Conference, a further meeting at Bombay had decided to abandon non-co-operation in four stages and to introduce full non-co-operation immediately on the expiry of the month&apos;s notice to the Viceroy. This, however, is not in accordance with Ganclhi&apos;s statement. The local Caliphate&quot; agitation is likely to die out as the local leaders are lukewarm and neither Mohamedans nor Hindus are prepared to resign their posts unless assured of financial support.Assam. The leading Mohamedans of Sylhet do not countenance the disloyal propaganda, and the success obtained by local agitation is inconsiderable.From the North-West Frontier Province it is reported that the policy of. non-co-operation adopted by the Allahabad Conference has hitherto found no sympathy. There are indications that the fictitious agitation is gradually becoming discredited and that the saner element is rallying to the side of the Government. The Hindus have definitely dropped out of the agitation. The hijrat figures available to date are 133. Emigrants come chiefly from .the central Punjab districts, Delhi, and Peshawar city. In the majority of cases they are impecunious people of the lower class influenced by the hope of material betterment by emigration to Afghanistan. A comprehensive scheme has been drawn up for the -hijrat propaganda in rural tracts and a list of volunteers to collect funds from villagers prepared. So far, however, no action has been taken in this direction, though the danger of the scheme if materialized is obvious.3. The general result of the Allahabad meeting is of little political consequence, and the situation so far has not changed for the worse thereby. We must now await the effect of Gandhi&apos;s next move and of the special Congress meeting. At the Tinnevelly meeting, Srinavasa Iyengar declared that the Caliphate question was primarily the concern of Mohamedans, and that Hindus should not side with one section or the other. The Moslem League must decide this, and also what measure of help they desire from Hindus : non-co-operation was controversial, and he would give no opinion till after the special Congress. -Non-co-operation continues to be criticized by the moderate Press. Subscriptions to the Caliphate movement are slackening, and the opinion is gaining ground that expenditure on deputations is useless, and that Mohamed Ali must be spending large sums of money to no purpose in Europe. Proposals have been made that no Moslems should leave India on pilgrimage to Mecca. this year, but, should instead give money to the Caliphate movement, but the scheme has not materialized. Our provision of facilities for intending pilgrims has been a. source of satisfaction.At the same time the endeavours to seduce the loyalty of the troops are believed&apos; to. be increasing, and this subject is receiving our careful attention. We have addressed the Local Governments, requesting them to take vigorous steps to detect
--and punish seditious propagandists of this type, and we have to-day conferred with the Punjab and the United Provinces and the military authorities on the whole-question with a view to considering on what lines concerted action can best be taken. Special steps will be taken to track seditious propagandists who attempt to tamper with soldiers or recruiting, and to collect evidence against them with a view to prosecution. We are also consulting the law officers as to the legal position should it be found necessary to prosecute Gandhi or Shaukat Ali in the event of the non-co-operation movement securing substantial support.4. Election activity continues, much of the violence of speech-making being campaigning tactics to catch voters. Organized propaganda among tenants is proceeding in the United Provinces through the agency of Kisan Sabha.At Pabna, at a district conference under the presidency of Sir Ashutosh Choudhury, a retired High Court judge, resolutions were passed declaring the reforms inadequate, unsatisfactory and disappointing, ancl urging that only those who -accepted the Congress resolutions should be returned members of the new Council. Resolutions urging the Bill of Rights, the revision of the Turkish peace terms, and the retention of the Bengal Regiment were passed. There has also beeir some -criticism in the Press on the proposed disbandment of the battalion. In the closing conference Sir A. Choudhury declared he would join the Congress, and try to reconcile moderates and extremists.The provincial conference at Tinnevelly passed a resolution confirming that of the Arnritsar Congress with only four dissentients. In spite of protests from Mrs. Besant ancl Shastri a further resolution was carried urging the electorate to return at the coming elections only those who accepted the Arnritsar Congress resolutions. Lajput Rai has published an announcement sajdng he will not stand for the Legislative &quot;Council, ancl will advise others to boycott the reforms owing to dissatisfaction over the Hunter Report.He proposes the organization of a Defence Committee to make the boycott effective against any person who does stand for election.5. There is. considerable labour and economic unrest. Madras reports several strikes in progress. A meeting of employers ancl labour requested the Government to appoint a committee to enquire into the causes of the present unrest and the remedies to be applied. The question is being considered by the Madras Government. In Bengal, the economic situation is generally unsatisfactory. The demand for Government action with regard to high prices is growing, and notice has been given of a private bill to deal with profiteering. The labour situation on railways is somewhat improving, though the possibility of agitators causing trouble on the East Indian Railway &quot;must be borne in mind. From the United Provinces it is reported that the Lahore strike was beginning to react unfavourably on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, whose employees held a meeting and drew up demands. The movement, however, is not gaining strength. The strike situation at Lahore is stationary; the men are returning and there are indications of a desire to resume work. The strike is at present of far less consequence than it was three weeks ago. -Signs of labour unrest are reported from Jamshedpur. The deputation of representa-tives of labour wished to proceed to Bombay to interview the directors, but the Labour Association has since informed the committee that the directors will visit Jamshedpur by the end of the month to meet the labour representatives ancl announce what, further concessions they propose to make.THE DOMINIONS.Mandates for former German Colonies. The following telegram from the &quot;Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was sent on 30th June : It is hoped to get mandates, for all former German Colonies settled at Brussels, with a view to signature at Spa. In order to avoid the necessity for the ratification the draft conventions prepared for this purposehave been turned into declarations containing the following provision: The present declaration shall be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations -for confirmation.   It will come into force on such confirmation.18-1C
It is also provided that: On ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, the United. States will have full power to adhere to the present declaration.It is proposed that all declarations, including those relating to Central Africa,, should be signed on behalf of all the Dominions.

They are asking the Dominion Governments by telegraph whom they wish to appoint as their representatives to-sign the instruments, but in any case the Dominion representatives cannot be certain, of attending in Paris on 2nd July, and there must therefore be a provision inserted, enabling the treaty to be signed by the named plenipotentiaries at any period within, a month from the date borne by the treaty. Unless the names of the Dominion plenipotentiaries are received before the final draft for signature is prepared, the-names of the High Commissioners who have signed recent treaties should be inserted in the preamble, and the formula employed in the Air Convention, enabling other-plenipotentiaries to sign the instrument, must be inserted.In response to the above Lord Derby reported [No. 783] from Paris on 1st July that he had secured the postponement of signature until the morning of 5th.

two countries, is not entirely consistent with the letter of that Covenant which both Governments earnestly desire to respect. Accordingly they have the honour jointly to inform the League that they recognize the principle that if the said agreement be continued after Jrdy 1921 it must be in a form which is not inconsistent with that Covenant. .Lord Milner continued as follows : This declaration, your Ministers will observe, does not commit us to a renewal of the alliance in this or any other form.

Up to the beginning of May last the amount at the credit of the wool accounts was insufficient to pay the interest due to the Treasury, but since then a credit balance has accrued which will steadily increase in proportion to the sales effected month by month.

SOUTH AFRICA,Proposed Re-establishment of German Gonsidatcs [B.E.R., xvii., p. 9]. Referring to the Govemor-Generabs telegram, of 30th April, which stated that his Ministers had no objection to the re-establishment of German Consulates in South Africa provided they were consulted as to individual appointments, the Secretary of State sent the following message on the 2nd July : The German Government desire to appoint as consul-General at Cape Town Hang, who before the war was Consul at Johannesburg. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to learn whether your Ministers have any reason for objecting to this nomination; In this connexion your Ministers may like to know that the French Government propose to postpone consideration of the question of the-establishment of German Consuls in,France until an agreement has been reached with regard to economic relations between the two countries, but it is not proposed to adopt a similar policy so far as the United Kingdom is concerned. 18-1 DMeat. On 30th June the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in regard to tlm latterV telegram of 26th May [B.E.R., xix, p. 11], saying that he was desired by his Prime Minister to convey the following urgent representations : On behalf of the producers of the Dominion the Prime Minister again respectfully urges the necessity for at least one month&apos;s extension of the requi-sitiou, for two reasons : firstly, the i season in New Zealand has been very late, and meat is still coming in and likely to come in for some weeks ; and secondly, a very considerable delay arose from the congestion of stores-in England, and, in&apos; conse--quence, the freezing stores in New Zealand became blocked. The Prime Minister desires to point out that what is happening now is not only a matter of inconvenience but a serious loss to producers in different parts of New Zealand. His Govern-ment, therefore, hope that in the special circumstances the Imperial authorities will -agree to extend the period of requisition, at any rate to 31st July next.Consular Records of Samoa.-On 29th June the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State as follows : The Government of New Zealand desires the permission of the Imperial -Government to take possession of the consular records of Samoa, which are now stored in the old British consulate at Apia. These records date back to about 1847, and it is understood that most of them are preserved in the Colonial Office either in the original or in duplicate. The collection generally at the present time is in a bad state, owing to ravages of insects, and it is essential that some better provision should be made for their custody if they are to be saved from total destruction. The collection includes - statistical records which should form part of the records of the new civil administration of Western Samoa, and many other documents of the very greatest interest to New Zealand and of some historical value. The Government will be very glad to take charge of the records which are not required for the, purposes of the Samoan administration, and after bringing them to the Dominion would have them properly classified, catalogued and preserved for the benefit of students and -others interested in the history of the Western Pacific. If you assent to this course the Government will be glad to be advised of your decision by telegraph in order that prompt steps may be taken to save these records from further deterioration.Proposed Re-establishment of German Consulates. The following telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies was sent to the Governor-General of New Zealand on 2nd July:-In the event of the German Government reporting the intention to re-establish consular representation in iNew Zealand, it is proposed to reply that there is no objection in principle to the re-establishment, and to ask to whom the German Government propose to entrust appointments. Do your Ministers concur? Your Government would of course be consulted before any individual is -accepted, and in the event of the German Government selecting officers not acceptable, they would be asked to nominate other persons for approval. In this connexion, it is understood.that the French Government propose to postpone consideration of the question of the re-establishment of German. Consuls in France until an agreement has been reached with regard to economic relations between the two countries, but it is not proposed to adopt a similar policy so far as the United Kingdom is concerned.
The League of Nations : Extracts from General Smuts&apos; Important Review.  reuter&apos;s Capetown agent telegraphed.,as follows on 4th June: General Smuts, in. the House of Assembly to-day, replying in the debate on the League of Nations, admitted that so far, in its early days, the League of Nations had not responded to-the great hopes entertained of it, and he said so with the greatest sorrow. &quot; Let them not rejoice over its failure,&quot; he continued, &quot; but rather, in the words of Mr. Merriman, &apos; pray that it might be made a reality and a real power.&apos; Let them bend their energies and lend their, strength to make the institution a reality in the affairs-of the world.&quot; (Cheers.) Several circumstances militated against the success of the League, the greatest of all, perhaps, was what he might call the &quot; defection of&quot; America.&quot; There was no doubt that the League had been largely dependent on the strength and support of America for its initial success. America could have brought to the League influences and resources absolutely needed to-day, but she had not chosen the part of a moral leader of the world. He hoped that time was coming when America would understand and appreciate what the position was. Whatever the-reason was it did not become them to pass judgment on America. It might be that-after the Presidential election America would take up her true position and help to pull the League through its initial difficulties.The second difficulty was the apparent supersession of the League of Nations-by the Supreme Council which led to the impression that the Supreme Council was usurping the functions of the League and -that the latter was being pushed into the background. General Smuts hoped that the time was not far off when the Council would recognize that it was best the two bodies should, combine. Great Britain and France were left responsible for the state of affairs which had arisen in the world and had to be remedied. It was hopeless to expect that two Powers could right the situation, which was daily becoming worse.If this situation continued he was afraid they were running very grave risks. The danger was that other Powers would combine and range themselves against these two and the world would again be drawn into dissensions on these grounds.The third blow was undoubtedly the Polish war, which had done more to-make people realize the apparent impotency of the League than anything else. It was only by focussing public opinion on these events that they would be able to right the situation. He believed public opinion was forming against the action.of Poland, which would have the result that the action of Poland might give the League its opportunity of making people recognize that, unless the League was---forced to arid did take action; the future of Europe would be very dark indeed.The situation was going from bad to worse, and unless they could mobilize a tremendous force of public opinion all over the world, he did not see what would happen in the old world, and that was why he felt their debate might have its little-&apos; share of -influence, in assisting the formation of that public opinion which would eventually force the Great Powers to support the League and bring about a better-state of affairs.Referring to the point raised in relation to the position of the British Empire,. General Smuts said the British Empire to-day consisted of a number of free nations-under a common sovereign, who had to conduct their affairs on a common basis, and the cpiestion was : How could that be done now that the old system had departed ? The problem that now arose was : How were they now-going to conduct the affairs of this Empire on a common basis where they had no longer one Great Power speaking for the whole, but six independent and equal free members of this great League ? -Referring to this new position of the Dominions, General Smuts said that the-time had come to clear up the situation which had arisen. . . . The only way was to call for this purpose a constitutional Conference, and he hoped the Conference,, if called together next year, would be able to go thoroughly into the whole position,, and, on the basis of the equality of the various parts of the British Empire, frame a scheme which would make it possible for them to be free and equal, but subject to-the retention of the affairs of the Empire, in which all are interested, on a common basis.The common ground that should be taken up, not otily by the Dominions but. also by the British Government, was that no resolution could.be taken which was-binding on any part of theJEmpire, without its free consent, and the only way to give-effect to this view would be the adoption of the Conference system.
Prince Arthur of Connaught. Reuter&apos;s Capetown agent telegraphed on 23rd June saying that the whole-hearted enthusiasm of Parliament on the appointment of Prince Arthur of Connaught was reflected throughout the country. The wisdom of His Majesty&apos;s decision was applauded, and undoubtedly the whole of South Africa regarded this direct link with the King as a great compliment.Lord and Lady Buxton. ReuteFs Durban agent reports that on 22nd June Lord and Lady Buxton paid a farewell visit to the Chief of the Zulu nation at Maritzburg, which proved am impressive and touching parting.From the body of the hall, he says, Manzolwandhli, the son of Cetewayo, rose up and as a Chief of the royal Zulu blood expressed his thanks for the beneficent British rule. Chief Mini said that Lord Buxton was &quot;the ears, eyes and mouthpiece of His Majesty, for whom they felt whole-hearted devotion.&quot; The Chief further appealed to Lord Buxton, if the occasion arose, to speak for the Zulu nation in the British Parliament. The Zulus, he continued, had given assistance in the great war and if assistance were again needed they were prepared to die for their King and country.The Governor-General thanked the Zulus for their exceUent behaviour during the war and for their active assistance, and assured them that the Native Bill was intended as a real step towards their advancement.NEWFOUNDLAND.Proposed Re-establishment of German Consulates. A telegram identical with that sent to the Governor-General of New Zealand was despatched to the Governor of Newfoundland on 2nd July.   (See under &quot;New Zealand,&quot; p. 13.)
