GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending 18th and 25th January : -The Unemployment Situation. (1) The unemployment situation becomes steadily worse, and the number of unemployed persons continues to increase. The opposition to the Governments short-time proposals does not diminish, the proposal to introduce short-time working into the Government dockyards having been strongly condemned by the employees concerned. The question of short-time working on the railways has also been discussed, and the executive committee of the National Union of Railwaymen issued a statement on the 13th January alleging that the introduction of this arrange-ment on the railways would result in,placing large numbers of members of the union below the poverty line, and would also be a violation of the principle of the &quot; guaranteed week.&quot; The Scottish trade union congress, at a special meeting held in Glasgow on the loth, also criticised the Governments proposals severely, and demanded full maintenance for unemployed workers, resumption of trade with Russia, and the distribution of food, through the local authorities,   (.18th January.)(2) The number of ELM Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 14th January was 299,505, comprising 298,963 for men and 542 for women. In addition, there were 15,198 policies lodged by short-time workers, 15,1.13 for men and 85 for women. On the 7th January there were 287,909 policies lodged, 287,380 by men and 529 by women. On the same date there were 10,870 policies lodged by short-time workers, 10,855 for men and 15 by women.On the 14th January in the United Kingdom 5-18,047 unemployment books, 303,665 for males and 244,382 for females, remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act. Compared with the previous week, when there were 280,084- lodged by males and 223,808 by females, the increase is 44,155. In addition there were 570,993 books lodged by short-time workers, 215,645 by males and 355,348 by females, an increase on the previous week of 111,038.The total on the live register of all employment exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 21st January was 998,000.The above are advance figures provided by the employment department and are subject to revision.The proposals for the working of short time in Government industrial establishments were put into operation&apos;on the 24th January. The attitude which the men concerned should adopt towards the proposals was considered at a meeting of workers&apos; representatives of the departmental joint industrial councils held at the Ministry of Labour on the 19th January. A resolution was passed reaffirming the former decision of the workers to have nothing to do with the official scheme, and rejecting its principle. The meeting expressed the opinion that such a proposal-should have been submitted by the Government, in the first instance, to the industrial councils, and that the procedure adopted by the Government violated the principles of the councils, and tended to destroy their usefulness and purpose. It further recommended the executives of all the unions to withdraw their representatives from the councils. Representatives of the official side of the councils were not present at the conference. The greatest opxiosition to the scheme conies from Woolwich, where an &quot;all grade&quot; committee, uniting skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers, has been formed to organize resistance. Nevertheless, it has apparently been considered expedient to accept the scheme for the present; and the advice of the unions in this sense has been adopted, pending the national decision on labour policy to be taken at the joint delegate conference of the Labour party and the trades union congress on the 27th January. The grievance of the men at the action of the Government in enforcing their proposals without regard to the opinion of the workers&apos; side of the departmental councils has been officially expressed in a letter from Mr. Arthur Henderson to the Minister of Labour. Mr. Henderson declares that the constitution of the councils has been flouted, and that no good purpose can be served by the workers continuing their representation upon them.   (25th January.)The terms of reference of. Lord St. David&apos;s committee have now been extended in two directions.   Firstly, the committee have been authorized to make grants towards
approved local schemes to cover GO per cent., instead of 30 per cent., of the wages bill -of the additional unemployed men taken on for work on these schemes ; and, secondly,: the committee may now make grants in respect of work on roads, other than those* within &quot;the Ministry of Transports scheme for construction or maintenance grants.   It is understood that, as a general rule, the committee will not assist road schemes where the expenditure on labour is less than 50 per cent, of the total cost. .:. The special committee on unemployment appointed by the London County -Council report that work already put in hand in relief of unemployment, in the area covered by the council, involves an expenditure of approximately 30O,00l)L When additional work, which has been sanctioned, is started, the expenditure will be increased to about 680.000Z.   (25th January.)Decline in Cue Cost of Living. (1) The Labour Gazelle cost-of-living index number for the 1st January was 165, as compared with 169 on the 1st December aud 176 on the 1st-November. The decline during the month was mainly,due to reductions in the prices of several of the principal articles of food, for example, flour and bread, bacon, margarine and butter, sugar, tea, eggs and potatoes, and in the price of clothing. It will be seen that the figure, after having risen steadily, except during the year 1919, since the end of 191-1, now appears to be on the decline, (.18th January.)(2) The decline in the cost of living will necessarily be reflected in a reduction of wages in those industries, such as the railway industry, where the payment of wages, is governed, partly at any rate, by cost-of-living sliding scales, while the weakening of prices will, similarly affect the wage earners in industries, as, for example, some :sectious of the iron and steel trades, which follow a sliding scale based on the selling price of the product.   (18th January,)COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.Question of Self-Government. Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed from Capetown as follows on 24th January : The elected members of the Rhodesian Legislative Council replying to the Imperial Government make the strongest request for immediate self-government. Sir Charles Coghlau, chairman of the elected members of the Council, has sent a reply to Lord Milner&apos;s memorandum in which he says the elected members contend that the uncertainty of the political position in South Africa constitutes an additional reason why the request of Rhodesia for self-government should be granted without delay. Secondly, the reply contends that new settlers would naturally share the desire of fellowr British subjects for self-government. The last election was on a new up-to-date register, therefore an immediate self-governmont claim should not be -defeated by a new and probably fractional element with a comparatively small knowledge of the conditions obtaining in Rhodesia. Thirdly, the reply says that the elected members are unable to agree to delaying the grant of self-government till 1923, and suggest that if the Secretary of State for the Colonies has any doubt as to the unanimous feeling of the country the question, could be simply and expeditiously settled by a referendum.Finance. The elected members express pleasure at the recognition by the Imperial Government of the necessity of a loan for capital expenditure and consequently.gladly accept the offer of the Imperial Government and are prepared to pass the necessary ordinance as quickly as possible.   They emphasize that this should not be dependant on the conclusion of other negotiations.   With reference to the Cave award-concerning public works, they are prepared to accept the principle of payment only for what the country has received and agrees to take over. On the question of land on which public works are erected, they do not consider it equitable that they should be expected to pay the present-day value for land which owes its present value largely to the enterprise of the people of the country. It is suggested that if the&apos; Imperial Government does not concur in this view, the matter should be referred to-arbitration.   The reply concludes by appealing for self-government at the earliest&apos;
possible moment so that the new administration may be aide to negotiate with tine-Imperial Government on questions affecting the country. The hope is expressed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies will accept these modifications and that it will not be necessary at present for a delegation to go to London for a personal discussion.. If, however, on further consideration, the reply says, the Secretary of State requires the attendance of a delegation, they will accept his hind invitation. The text of the reply was carried by 12 votes to 1, but Messrs. Stewart and Fletcher, members of the Legislative Council, considered that the reply should be submitted to the public before-being definitely sent to the Imperial Government.EGYPT.The Sultan. Lord Allenby reported [No. 63] on 26th January that there could be no doubt that the Sultan&apos;s prestige had risen considerably, and that great success-was attending his tour.The Cairo Tramioay Company. On 27th January Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 72] informing Lord Curzon that he had approved the promulgation of a decree,, providing that no sum payable by way of wages should be assigned to any trade union; the prohibition applying equally to appeals in favour of a union for the-encashment of wages. The decree (which would be made applicable to foreigners by proclamation under martial law) was preceded by a recital that it was contrary to-public policy to allow irrevocable assignment of wages to trades unions.The reason for this decree was the constitution, some two months ago, of an. association of employees of the Cairo Tramway Company, having for its object the irrevocable assignment to the union of the totality of the future wages of its members-who appeared to be in number about a half of the tramway employees. Should this be held to be legal, the tramway service would be at the mercy of an ambitious-lawyer who was fomenting the movement.The Returned Zaglovlists.-On 28th January Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 69] that the Zagloulists who had returned from Paris had made a declaration, of which the following was a translation, to the newspaper Nizam, on 26th January at Alexandria : We have come to serve the Egyptian cause which we undertook to serve-in 1918, ancl we are all determined up to the end to ask for the abolition of the protectorate (? immediately), ancl to abide by the reservations made by the nation which the delegation considers as a fundamental condition to entering into-negotiations.They arrived in Cairo, Lord Allenby went on to say, the same afternoon, ancl were met at the station by a crowd of some 6,000 persons. There was no disorder, and no great excitement or enthusiasm.The following summary of a written statement given by Ismail Sidky Pasha to Mr. Hooker, ReutePs correspondent, seemed to be an accurate description of the-present situation : The unexpected announcement of the impending arrival in Egypt of certain of the Zagloulist associates was interpreted variously in the country; it was-even rumoured that there had been a disagreement between them ancl Zagloul Pasha. Any disagreement there might have been was certainly not due to desaccord as to the object in view, but as to the means to its realises-zation; in fact the same disagreement as has existed here in Egypt since the cessation of conversations between Lord Milner and Zagloul. All still insist that they desire but one thing, &quot; independence,&quot; and detest but one thing,. &quot; the protectorate.&quot; A difference of opinion exists here. One party says, as Zagloul does, &quot;no official negotiations before a formal declaration from the British Government giving an assurance that the protectorate will be abolished&quot; : whilst the other party says &quot;as the British Government does not appear disposed to make a formal declaration let us negotiate on the basis of reservations, but with the firm intention of realizing them.&quot;Both parties were anxious to know what attitude the Zagloulists would adopt on their arrival; they immediately made their declaration (in the sense given above), and added that as their attitude has necessarily been one of expectation since Lord Milner presented his report, they prefer to wait for the result in Egypt so as to be on the spot when the moment comes to take a definite line of action.
There is no ground for the rumour emanating from London of the creation of --a party with Achy Pasha at its Jiead which the Zagloulists were supposed to be on their way to join. Adly Pasha, on whom rest the hopes of the country as far as future negotiations are concerned, is maintaining an attitude of awaiting the decision of the British Government. Be is abstaining from, all political action until the time when fie shall judge such action to lie necessary.INDIA.Mission to Kabul [IIP.IP, xxxv, p. 2].--On 15th January the Viceroy telegraphed [70 S.] that Sir Henry Dobbs had reported to him that he had held a five hours&apos; private -conversation with the Amir and Tarsi before the formal negotiations began.   The information concerning the amir&apos;s relations with the Bolsheviks and Jemal had made it a necessity to confront him with it before opening formal discussions.   The Amir -and Tarsi seemed upset at the communication of this information, and Sir Henry had naturally refused to disclose the source of information.   He explained, however, the -difficulty of carrying on negotiations until the matter was cleared up.   The Amir led -a somewhat one-sided discussion in which he dwelt on the failings of British, policy as compared to that of Russia, especially in the alienation of Islam.   By helping Afghanistan to become a big Mussulman power, he said Great Britain could prove that her quarrel with Turkey had been clue to political and not to religious considerations. Be enquired as to our policy in Persia and appeared surprised at the reply which probably did not tally with the information he had received from Russian sources. The conversation ended in perfect good humour.On 20th January, the Viceroy followed [98 S.] with Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; further report dated 18th January, in which he gave the substance of a long conference which lie and Muspratt had Held with Tarsi and Nadir Khan on the same day. The Afghan representatives had. given the assurance (1) that the treaty with Russia had not yet been ratified, and that it was still within the rights of Afghanistan to refuse to do so; (2) that Afghanistan would not ratify any clause hostile to the British -Governments interests on the borders, if she were satisfied, iu the course of the discussion, of our friendship; (3) that denials position, as far as Afghanistan was concerned, was that of adviser in the reorganization of the army, and that he would not be allowed to enter on propaganda or dealings with the frontier tribes. Nadir Khan enlarged, on the enmity of all the world, and of Islam especially, towards Great Britain, and declared that Afghanistan must receive an ample quid pro quo if she Was to risk the odium of Indian Moslems and the tribes by entering on a friendship with Great Britain ; (4) that the great obstacle to the way of friendship lay in the question ,-of the tribes.Sir Henry Dobbs gave no hope of any alteration, in the British attitude on this question, but expressed his willingness to discuss any proposals for bettering the mutual feelings aud eliminating difficulties.Continuing Sir Henry Dobbs&apos;reports, the Viceroy telegraphed [111 8.] on 24th January that the first official sitting had taken place on the morning,of :20th January,, The proceedings had been opened by Tarsi stating that, subject to certain modifications, Afghanistan agreed generally to the principles of the Mussoorie -aide-memoire [B.E.R., xxix, p. 3]. The Afghans produced a draft treaty containing live clauses, and intimated that a further six clauses, containing highly debatable matter, would be introduced at the next sitting. Briefly, the five clauses produced dealt with the following:-(.!) Affirmation of Afghan independence ; (2) the right of -each party to have legation capitals, London and Kabul; (3) Consulates, and details regarding restrictions on Ministers and Consuls and their status; (!) free right to Afghanistan of import of arms, military material, machinery and the like, wherever purchased; (5) commercial matters. Sir Henry declined to comment on any part of. the draft Until the whole scope of the proposals was before him.On 26th January the Viceroy transmitted [125 S.] the continuation of Sir Henry&apos;s report dated 25th January, which recorded the proceedings of the first part of the second official meeting at which the first three of the remaining six clauses were, put forward, which dealt with the following subjects: (6) postal convention, stipulating 25-1 &apos; - B
uthat neither side shall establish post offices in the other&apos;s territory ; (7) payment by-Great Britain to Afghanistan of 4 crores 36 lakhs of rupees on account of expenses-incurred by the late Amir in preserving neutrality during the late war; (8) the -intense desire for freedom of the -tribes on the south-east border, as having formerly &apos; been part of Afghanistan, affirming the right of self-determination of these &quot;tribes, and providing for a plebiscite of the tribesmen in the unadministered territories of the North-West Frontier P roviuce, with the object of determining the future form of government for each separate tribe.On 27th January the Viceroy telegraphed [129 S.] the remainder of Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; report giving the gist of the rest of the clauses to the following effect: (9) a mutual undertaking to cause no trouble in the othePs territory, after the re-arrange--nient under the preceding clause ; (10) an undertaking on the part of Great Britain to amend the Turkish treaty so as to provide for the well-being of Turkey, and to assure the freedom of Mesopotamia, Syria and the Hejaz ; (11) the cancellation of all previous treaties.Sir Henry Dobbs pointed out to the Afghan representatives that the draft articles-differed so radically from the aide-memoire which the Amir had accepted in principle, relying on which the mission had been sent, that it might result in his immediate recall.    Sir Henry obtained a postponement for consideration, and reported his intention of taking up especially the seventh, eighth, and tenth clauses, beginning-with the eighth.The Viceroy reported in this telegram that Sir Henry Dobbs had been informed on 27th January that the line he had taken met-with entire approval. Byway of&quot; strengthening his hands, a message was sent which he was authorized to deliver to the Amir znd Tarsi if he thought desirable. This was to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s (Government had only consented to send a mission to Kabul on the amir&apos;s pledge-regarding the acceptance of the aide-memoire as a basis, and Tarsi&apos;s pledge regarding Waziristan. As apparently it was proposed to scrap these pledges, Sir Henry Dobbs must be prepared for orders for instant recall.Telegraphing [186&apos;S.] on 29th January, the Viceroy gave Sir Henry Dobbs&apos;&apos; report of the sitting on the 27th.   He had opened by saying he would deal with clause 8 first, as the most serious, because it woidd be idle to discuss the remainder of the treaty if the Afghans adhered to the demands made in this clause.   Passages-from the AmiPs and Tarsi&apos;s letters, stating their acceptance of the principles of the Mussoorie conference, were then read, ancl Sir Henry declared his inability to depart from those principles.   The&apos;Afghans laid stress on our difficulties and the necessity of Afghan friendship.   It was evident also from certain expressions that the Persian situation was having a very mischievous effect.   Arguments were becoming somewhat heated, so Sir Henry suggested that the Afghans should take time to consider his-statements, ancl should propose a scheme which, in the light of these statements, would be likely to be acceptable.   Without such a scheme further meetings would be-useless.Sir Henry did not receive the Viceroy:&apos;s telegram of the 27th until after the-sitting, and was reserving it- for use on a future occasion if the Afghans still remained intractable.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent by the Viceroy on 23rd and 30th January : I. (23rd January). Section 1. Provincial reports as follows :-Bengal. C. R. Das&apos; abandonment of practice as a lawyer has given an impetus to the non-co-operation movement, and his example is likely to be followed by other lawyers. Expectation of a visit from Gandhi has also quickened enthusiasm. A movement is reported to be afoot by the caliphate ancl non-co-operation committees, and amongst the Marwari Bhatias, to boycott the Duke&apos;s visit; also a movement to utilize ex-detenus for carrying on the non-co-operation propaganda.Section 2. Chakravarti, C. R. Das, Abdul Kalam Azad, Bakr Siddiq and Khoja 4bdul Karim have issued a provisional village organization scheme, pending further action of a similar scheme by the provincial congress. The scheme includes the establishment of primary national schools in villages, village banks, inducing the authorities to reduce the area of jute cultivation, the boycott of foreign goods,, arbitration courts, the prevention of the consumption of liquor. The United Provinces gives the following details regarding the events at Munshiganj. On the afternoon of 6th January, information was received that the crowd was assembling to loot the-bazaar.   The civil police arrested some suspicious characters, ancl armed police were-
sent, -but the mob dispersed. On the morning of. the 7th, a crowd of 650 men assembled by the bridge near Munshiganj, and were proceeding towards the jail to release the prisoners. These men were rounded up and put in jail, but were sub-sequently released. Later a crowd of about 3,000 assembled on the road between Munshiganj and Rai Bareli, were addressed by the deputy-commissioner and others, and persuaded to go back along the road. On reaching the other side of the bridge, the numbers were largely augmented, and the crowd, numbering between 7,000 to 10,000 men, became unmanageable. It refused to retire, and the police and officers were subjected to volleys of stones and kankar, attacks also being made with lathis.; It became necessary to use fire-arms. Had firing not been resorted to, a large mob would have entered the city with disastrous results. The crowds included a number of pesis and other criminal characters. The independent newspaper AUaliabad has attempted to make capital out of the occurrences at Rai Bareli, describing them as the Rai Bareli tragedy.Section 3. The commissioners at Lueknow and Fyzabad, have been ordered to make proposals for dealing with the local difficulties, and a special officer has been put on duty under the Board of Revenue to work at proposals for the revision of the Oudh Rent Act.Section 4. A strike has started in Almora against cooly (? coolie) Ctar (Supply-coolie transport in hills) and is likely to spread.   No violence.Section 5. Punjab. The lull in political agitation continues, but the rural classes are being gradually inoculated and panchayats are being established in many places to dispose of petty cases without resort to the courts. Sikh political activities give some cause for anxiety.   The Kirpan question is becoming serious.Section 6. There were no unseemly demonstrations to disturb the harmony of the provincial durbar and the inauguration of the new councils on the 8th. The ceremonies were most successful. The selection of Ministers was well received, and of late there has been less talk of rendering the reforms nugatory. The Tribune (Lahore) has taken exception to the Moslem League&apos;s resolution, advising Afghan-istan to refuse an alliance with Great Britain. The question of the&apos; Amritsar indemnity has been made over for consideration in Council by the Governor, and his action on the whole has been well received. A section of the Sikh press welcomes the establishment of the Sikh Liberal League. The Lajpat Rai&apos;s Tilak school of politics has been inaugurated, but the lectures are poorly attended. Ctain Chand barber has been elected at a by-election to the local Legislative Council. Two-respectable candidates also stood.Section 7. The lull in the non-co-operation movement has disappeared-the-agitation is carried on vigorously in Patna, Bhagalpur and Tirhut. Local arbitration courts and Seva Samitis are being established. National schools are being got up,, but the attack on the Government schools is meeting with little success. The temperance movement is momentarily spreading, but likely to fade away. At the same time meetings are being held all over the three divisions, and a state 6f excitement and uneasiness is being produced. The non-co-operation movement has extended to Orissa, formerly unaffected. The Utkal union conference adopted non-co-operation, but this is reported to be due to.the preponderance of the Singhbhum delegates and the decision may be challenged. The Bihar and Orissa students also adopted non-co-operation, and there was a noisy demonstration by students at Cuttack,. at a meeting to congratulate Lord Sinha and Madhusunan Das on their appointments. The Bihar students&apos; conference (delegates attending, 157) resolved (1) that the-association should deal with political matters affecting the students&apos; community, provided that only students over 16 years of age participated, and should call on the &quot; students of Bihar and Orissa above 16 to withdraw immediately from the Government schools ; and (2) that the delegates should take steps next day to withdraw from such institutions.   It is unlikely that many students will withdraw.Section 8. Assam. The Assam association in a recent conference defined its object as the attainment of swaraj by all legitimate means, but there was no-resolution about non-co-operation, and the president, while supporting the movement generally, did not advocate the withdrawal of boys from the schools. One person elected to the local Council announced his intention of resigning his seat, but has not yet done so.Section 9. Central Provinces. Intensive propaganda prior to, during and after the congress familiarized the masses in the towns and some larger villages with the-idea of non-co-operation, and the political situation is deteriorating.   Mohamedans
have been aroused to a considerable state of excitement. There have been a few-incidents of defiant attitude towards the authority of Government servants. A wave of excitement is passing through the schools and colleges, but the position has not turned but as badly as was anticipated. The number of students who have left is small, but. there are numerous waverers, and the attendance at some institutions is poor. Every effort is being made to counteract the non-co-operation propaganda by the heads of various institutions, and an improvement, is hoped for if tile students are not continuously subjected to mischievous influence. Three national schools have beeu -established. With the departure of Gandhi and the Ali brothers, the Mahratta Brahmins, under the leadership of Dr. Munje, are raising their heads and are said to lie contemplating a counter-movement against the educational boycott. Apart from educational unrest and the suspension of practice by six lawyers, manifestations of non-co-operation are not so iar very serious; there has been only one resignation of an elected member of the Council. The social boycott, however, though repudiated by Gandhi, is encouraged by the Ali brothers, and is being practised, facilities for burial being refused to an elected Mohamedan member of the local Council who recently died.   This is clearly (? word omitted) anxiety about situation.Section 10. Delhi. Week comparatively quiet. The congress committee advertised in the press plans for marring success of the Dukes visit; namely, hartal, on the day of inauguration of the Council and Legislative Assembly, and on the evening of the fireworks at the fort.   .Section 11. It is understood that the merchants and shopkeepers resent interference, and the desire to witness tamasha is likely to prevail, as the proclamation parade on 1st January was witnessed by a large and appreciative crowd. The local national court (? has been handed) over to the congress committee. The institutions of suits in the ordinary law courts has not so far been affected. In the business outlook there has been no improvement. The congress resolution justifying the repudiation of contracts owing to the depreciation of the rupee was accepted at the meeting of the piece-goods merchants.Burma. The university and school boycott has beeu the main political feature. The senate made a considerable concession in regard to the university regulations and the local Government has agreed to a conference for discussing measures connected with the improvement of Anglo-vernacular education. The concessions had no effect, 5,000 students and schoolboys are engaged in the boycott; national schools are to be established in Rangoon and elsewhere. There are indications of the Burma extremists endeavouring to get into closer touch with the Indian extremists. &apos; A social boycott ol: the--mode rates may also be tried.Bombay. The Mahratta national school has at last been opeued with about a dozen scholars. Gandhi informed a deputation of non-co-operating students that their role in the political scheme would receive special attention at the provincial, conference at Ahmedabad. One-rupee, five-rupee, and ten-rupee caliphate receipts are believed to be ready for issue. The congress resolution is being explained at public meetings, but there has been only one meeting of any importance, The Umballa trades association, as a protest against the depreciation in exchange, decided to order no more goods from abroad until August next, and to refuse to pay for goods ordered and received till the rupee is again 2*.Section .12. Associations of the depressed classes in Bombay have written to Col. Wedgwood and Mr. Spoor complaining of the social ostracism to which untouchables are subjected, and pointing out that the non-co-operation movement is openly aiming at the destruction of constituted authority, and that the withdrawal of.the British augurs ill for these classes.Section 13. Genera]. As a result of the renewed activities of non-co-operation after the Nagpur congress, the situation has undoubtedly worsened in many parts of the country. The most dangerous manifestations of the movement are the attempts to get at the rural masses, as in the United. Provinces ; ami there is some reason to apprehend that efforts will also be made to capture the labour organizations, with a view to bring about extensive strikes at a favourable moment. At the same time, sporadic disturbances are more likely than a co-ordinated and. simultaneous move-ment; and that lack of funds is hampering the non-co-operationers. is indicated by the appeals of Gandhi for self-denial, by the people. We are about to address the local Governments on the whole question, but, are not at present disposed to think that a radical change in the policy hitherto pursued will be necessary, though developments may occur at any moment which would necessitate this.
II. (30th January). Section 1. Considerable excitement has been caused in the D.A.V. college by the students demanding that the principal should invite Lajput Rai to address them in the college hall on non-co-operation. The managing committee held an emergency meeting, and decided that this could not be done, because the Seditious Meetings Act was iii force : they were probably not desirous of having the meeting held. A number of students subsequently made hostile demonstrations in hartal, and decided to strike, and hold a meeting in Gujranwala to discuss the situation with Lajput Rai. The strike movement is rapidly spreading to the Form ah Christian college, and the Dayal Singh college, and is practically complete in the D.A.V. college.&quot;Section 2. With reference to italian KoVs election to the Council, reported last week, later information shows that the election was keenly (&apos;? contested); there was no rowdyism,.no attempt to interfere with the voters, not a word said about or against the Government; the object of the voters was to humiliate the rival candidate, who is personally very unpopular, not to annoy the Government.Section 3. Bengal. At a meeting of the European Association, the following resolution was moved : This meeting unreservedly condemns the attitude of supine acquiescence with lawlessness and incipient anarchy, the Government of India has seen fit to adopt towards non-co-operation; and calls upon it to carry out the duty of government, and to put in force the Indian Penal Code against all persons proposing, and promulgating the particular form of lawlessness and &quot;anarchy, called non-co-operation. Thirteen voted for and 13 against, and it was lost by the casting vote of the chairman.Section 4. -Police reports which we are asking the local Governments to verily, indicate attempts to organize revolutionary parties, especially in Faridpur, where the ex-detenu Bayna Das is endeavouring to form a secret organization in furtherance of the non-co-operation movement. Increased activity on the part of ex-detenus and released state prisoners is reported throughout the province. The encouraging-feature of the taxi driveFs strike is tbe response made by volunteers, European, Eurasian, and women of the Red Cross Society, to keep transport going.Section 5. An Indian news agency telegram just received, states that there is an indication that complete hartal will be observed in northern Calcutta during the Duke&apos;s arrival. Notices printed in Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu had been distributed broadcast, purporting to have been issued by the Bengal caliphate committee, the congress sub-committee, and. the non-co-operation committee, asking citizens not to participate iu any function or demonstration organized by the Government. , Arrange-ments are being made to keep shops, bazaars, hotels, and restaurants closed from Monday morning till three in the afternoon, and to stop vehicular traffic along the main streets. Attempts have also been made to prevent steamers and boats from plying on the river during those hours. We have asked for reports of the Duke&apos;s visit.. The latest press message is as follows:---As a result of the preachings of non-co-operators, complete hartal was observed to-day in north and central Calcutta till three in the afternoon. All shops and markets were closed ; and vehicular traffic of all descriptions was suspended. Practically, every Indian place of business throughout the city was closed; only a few taxis driven by Europeans and Indians were obtainable. Two taxis driven.by Punjabis were damaged by a crowd near Entally, and a man was arrested, at Lai&quot; Bazar for interfering with a taxi driver. No meat, of any description was offered for sale at the new market this morning. At the entrance of the roads leading..to the Duke&apos;s, route, non-co-operators were seen persuading tbe crowd not to go near that route. At places, the method of persuasion took a threatening turn. The result was, that excepting at important crossings, the crowd along Duke&apos;s route was not dense. While this was going on, GandhPs son drove through the city,, asked the people to disperse. Picketers left the crossings, and all persuasions ceased. After this, persons went towards the route to see the Duke,: and immediately large crowds of people collected at the principal crossings.Section 6. United Provinces. It is reported that the caliphate committee has issued letters to the district committees regarding the establishment of a regular volunteer corps, the uniform to consist of khaki coats, brown belts, evening (sic) (? Cambay) caps. The volunteers to parade twice a week, and retired officers to be appointed drill instructors. Students about 17 to be enrolled. If the movement develops, the local Governments have ample powers under Act 14, 1908, and have (? already) informed us, on the, general question of volunteers, that no action is immediately necessary, but that, if required, Act 14 should be applied. 25-1 &apos; C
Bombay-Shankat Ali, in supporting Yakub Hussan, lecturing on swaraj, acclaimed the agrarian disturbances in the United Provinces as the first indication of the ultimate success of non-co-operation.Section 7. At a public meeting, Gandhi presiding, Mohamed Alps exhortation to the students to boycott the schools and colleges and follow the lend given by the Calcutta students, which would win swaraj, had no immediate effect. &apos; Gandhi and the Ali brothers expressed great disappointment.A disturbance occurred in the Mandi quarter of Bombay city on the 23rd in consequence of two Anglo-Indian boys killing some pigeons ; a large crowd collected and stoned the police, who had to make a baton charge. Several arrests were effected, but the local police considered it inadvisable to press a prosecution iii view of the generally peaceable attitude of the inhabitants of the quarter. Abdul Rahman, editor of the local caliphate daily paper, has been sentenced at Karachi to one years rigorous imprisonment on a charge of sedition.Bihar ancl Orissa report a breach of the peace at Samastipur. A newly joined assistant struck a coolie for stealing sugarcane, and the latter at once lay down and complained of being seriously hurt. The coolies, believing him to be dying, made a dash at the assistant who saved himself from serious injury by climbing up the building. The coolie was picked up by two Europeans, taken to the hospital and examined by the assistant surgeon, who found nothing wrong. He was motored back by the Europeans to within two miles.of the village and walked home. The coolies were, however, greatly excited by this and by the fact that another boy by accident fell into a vat of boiling sugar, got out of hand. The superintendent of the engineer factory endeavouring to pacify them, was assaulted with lathis and had his nose fractured. Two other Europeans were also reported hurt, but not seriously. Twenty-five armed police were sent to Samastipur to protect the factory should any further attempt be made.   Work will not be resumed there until excitement subsides.Section 8.-General. The press has been mainly concerned with the strike of the Calcutta students, to whom. Gandhi wrote a message of encouragement. The cost of the reforms, especially the salary of ministers, is. being ventilated in the papers, and notice of a resolution was received in the Bihar Council that the salary of ministers should be Re. 1. The opinion generally is that Rs. 5,000 is excessive, that the salary should at most be Rs. 2,500. A letter is about to issue to the. local Governments regarding the non-co-operation movement. The view taken in the letter is that the success so far attained in the execution of the items of the programme towards which the efforts are ostensibly directed, has not, despite recent vigorous attacks on educational institutions, been very great. It is probable that the campaign will now be largely directed towards other and more dangerous objectives. Agri-cultural tenants and large industrial centres furnish,the most promising field for the propaganda of non-co-operationers. Efforts to spread discontent amongst the former have already been made in Oudh and the Central Provinces, and other provinces may also be exploited. There is reason, tqo, to apprehend that an attempt will be made to capture the labour organizations as a means of bringing about something in the nature of a general strike. It is now considered that a radical change in the policy hitherto pursued is necessary at present. It is preferable to rely on measures such as (1) a close watch on attempts to get at the rural areas and the labouring classes; (2) inchoation of remedial legislation wherever required; (3) counter propaganda; (4) vigorous, prosecution of non-co-operation agents guilty of making seditious speeches or inciting to violence ; (5) enforcement in general of respect for the law, e.c/., in the case of, clearly unlawful assemblies. The local Governments have been asked, however, whether they concur in the appreciation of the situation and the measures suggested, or have alternative proposals to put forward. There are.rumours that efforts will be made to induce the servants of Europeans to boycott them, but, so far, except in a few isolated cases in Bengal, these efforts have not materialized.Political Vurest and the Sevres Treaty. On 26th January the Viceroy sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for India:-.You will have gathered from our last weekly telegram [23rd January] our views as. to the political situation. We are examining the question of our general policy towards non-co-operatiou and in relation to the internal questions which are among the causes of discontent, ancl we hope shortly to be in a position, after consulting the local Governments on certain points, to formulate, in detaiP the measures we propose to take to deal with the situation.
One of the most dangerous factors in the problem which confronts us is, however, the Moslem unrest over the Turkish peace terms. Whatever may have been the origin of the caliphate movement, it is now pre-eminently a religious one which has secured very general support. Even loyal Mohamedans, feeling rightly or wrongly that the terms are not just or consistent with published pledges, are unable to oppose the movement or face the religious pressure that is brought to bear on them, more especially the accusation of being Kafirs. So far the movement has not resulted in violence, save in one or two places, because the policy of the leader of the campaign is, at any rate for the present, to avoid violence; but we have reason to know that the extreme Mohamedan leaders are quite prepared to advocate immediate recourse to violence, and are confident of securing support for such a move, both within and outside India, by an appeal to ignorant and fanatical Mohamedans that Islam is being crushed ; the clanger of disorder will also be greater when the non-violence programme fails. In these circumstances, we fear that the refusal substantially to modify the Turkish peace terms, more particularly-because of the general and deep-rooted conviction that England alone blocks the way, may have consequences of a very grave character on the peace and tranquillity of this country, and we feel it incumbent on us, in view of our responsibility to His Majesty&apos;s Government, to Parliament and to the people of India once more to place on official record, in the plainest language, our deep misgivings on this subjectIt is our considered opinion that the only way of eradicating or even allaying Moslem (? excitement) is by a real modification of the treaty. The difficulties which the Turkish peace terms have created in our foreign relations, more particularly in regard to the peace negotiations with Afghanistan and the Persian crisis; the facilities they afford for Pan-Islamic intrigue and Bolshevik propaganda, and the dangerous effect which the religious feeling created thereby must have on Indian Mohamedan soldiers, have already been placed before you, and the present telegram is intended to deal with the internal situation only. From this aspect we venture to urge once again that you should place before His Majesty&apos;s Government our reading of the situation here, and impress upon them the urgent need for a modification of the treaty, not merely in the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Indian Moslem subjects, but for the preservation of tranquillity in India. We are well (? aware) (? that the) extremist class of political agitators will not be appeased by any such modification ; but we feel that if you succeed in securing it, you will strengthen very greatly the hands of our friends; detach a most influential section of Mohamedan (r opinion), namely, the section actuated by religious motives, from the present anti-Government agitation ; and assist us in avoiding serious internal disorder.THE DOMINIONS.Conference on Electrical Communications. On 21st January the following-telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and the Governor of Newfoundland: The preliminary conference at Washington on electrical communications agreed that the requirements of the five Powers taking part in the conference in regard to wave-lengths above 5,000 metres should be formulated as soon as possible for submission to the proposed world conference. The needs of Great Britain and the imperial chain are being considered by a commission appointed to plan the chain. If your Government consider this body suitable for formulating the needs of the Empire generally, please communicate for their information the needs of your Government in this respect. The commission is obtaining from the various government departments and wireless companies in this country statements of their needs. If your Government prefer that its requirements should be discussed personally with the commission by one of their own experts no time should be lost in arranging for his attendance; as it is highly desirable that a complete scheme in respect of the Empire should be formulated by the beginning of March, when a technical committee, composed of representatives of the five principal Powers, is to meet at Paris to co-ordinate their needs with a view to the submission of a complete scheme for the allocation of wave-lengths at the forthcoming world conference. The date of the latter conference has not yet been fixed.
CANADA.Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been supplied bv the Department of External Affairs : (1) The total external trade of the Dominion during the, calendar year 1920 amounted to $2,639,716,000, out of which total exports accounted for $1 302 805 000 and imports $1,336,91.1,000.    J\. &apos;   &apos;&apos;    &apos;(2) The final report of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics gives the 1920 wheat crop as 263,100,000 bushels, as compared with 193,260,000 bushels for 1919. The final estimate of the crop of oats is 530,709,000 bushels, and the estimate of the value of all field crops for 1920 on the basis of prices paid to farmers is $1,455,244,000. Out of a total yield of 263,000,000 bushels of wheat there was raised in the prairie provinces 234,000,000 bushels.(3.) Canadian imports during the month of December amounted to $85,882,000, and total exports are valued at $150,949,000.(4) Imports into Canada from the United Kingdom during the month of December amounted to $11,496,000, and the total value of exports thereto was $39,380,000. The total imports from the United Kingdom during the 12 months ended 31st December was $231,479,000, as compared with total exports worth $343,220,000. Imports of textiles from the United Kingdom, during 1920 amounted to $133,580,000.(5) The total value of the exports of pulp and paper from Canada during 1920 was $163,000,000, out of which total shipments to the United Kingdom were&apos;worth $13,417,000, to the United. States $129,356,000, and to other countries $20,444,000.AUSTRALIA.Oil Prospecting in Papua. On 19th January the Governor-General telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies with reference to the agreement of 7th July 1919, between the British Government, the -Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for oil prospecting in Papua: -The company&apos;s geological staff having completed its examination of the Papuan coastal, country between Yule and Upoia report that the geological structure generally is unfavourable for the existence of oil in industrial quantities, but have located one sufficiently promising test bore site. There is an indication that the oil belt extends westward into the Fly river region, but the country is very difficult and less promising than in ex-German New Guinea, and they suggest proceeding next with the examina-tion of the oil country in the ex-German territory. The Government of the Commonwealth is strbngly of opinion that this course should lie followed aud would be glad to know whether the Admiralty is agreeable to extend the oil agreement with, the Commonwealth to cover boring in ex-German New Guinea.Immigration from America. Telegraphing on 21st January the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that it was urged in a despatch following by mail that the greatest possible vigilance should be exercised by the British authorities in America to prevent undesirables coming to Australia. If the shipping companies accepted passengers on the faith of their passports, and the Commonwealth Government subsequently showed it necessary to refuse the passengers&apos; admission, the position of the companies was very difficult. The case of Esmonde was in point. The Commonwealth Government asked that, in addition to the matter specially dealt with in his despatch, an endeavour should be made by the Foreign Office and all authorities issuing passports to prevent the issue of passports for Australia to persons known, or believed to be disaffected towards the Empire or any of its constituent parts, or towards established government.new ZEALAND.Visit of E.M.S. Chatham. On 27th January the Governor-General telegraphed expressing, on behalf of the Government and people of New Zealand, the pleasure with Avhich the arrival of POPS. Chatham, had been welcomed. The people of the Dominion felt that the presence of that ship in New Zealand waters created a fresh link of Empire ; and that it was a sign of future close co-operation between the Government of New Zealand and the Admiralty, as well as of the fact that the ships guarding the interests of the Umpire in all parts of the world, even if acting under local authorities, constituted one force under one flag.
SOUTH AFRICA.WaoL-On 19th J anuary the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows to the Governor-General:  For some time past negotiations have been going on here with a view to the British Government purchasing a quantity of South African wool of last year&apos;s clip still unsold. Mr. Reynolds, manager of the National Bank of South Africa, and Mr. Chapped of Pretoria have been dealing on behalf of the South African Government with this matter.We understand that your Prime Minister is very anxious to find an outlet for this wool. The British Government have already, as a matter of fact, more wool on their hands than they know what to do with. Nevertheless, if terms can be--arranged, they are prepared to come to the assistance of the Union Government in the matter.The following are the most favourable terms which I am authorized to offer on behalf of the British Government: (1) His Majesty!s Government offer to purchase through the Union Government approximately 100,1)00 bales of South African wool of the 191.9-20 clip at present unsold and lying principally at South African ports.(2) The schedule of 1913-14 prices referred to in the Colonial Office telegram of 7th September 1917 shall be adopted as the schedule of prices for the various types of wool, and the arrangements for valuation of and. payment for the wool and for -carrying out the scheme generally shall be the same as those adopted in 191.7, except that while in 1917 55 per cent, was added to the 1913-14 schedule, on this occasion the purchase prices for the 1913-14 schedule are without any addition(3; As in 1917 the South African Government shall be credited by the Imperial Government with. 50 per cent, of any net profit realized on the re-sale of the wool purchased. The Imperial. Government shall be at liberty to entrust the sale of the wool to any properly constituted selling organization, and the audited accounts of that organization shall be accepted as final,(4) The Imperial Government will make no cash payments for any of the wool purchased ; but there shall be deducted from the present indebtedness of the Union Government to the Imperial Government the sums due in payment for such wool.(5) In further consideration of the purchase, the Union Government shall agree to place indents up to the value of the wool for telephone, railway and other material with manufacturers in Great Britain ; always provided that the basis of price shall be fair ami reasonable having regard to existing conditions. Such indents to be placed in whole or in part at the earliest possible date.(6) In order to enable the wool to be held economically in South Africa until market conditions improve, storage facilities so far as available shall be placed at the disposal of the Imperial Government at the lowest possible rates.I should be glad to know whether your Government would desire to avail themselves of this offer as soon as possible.The Elections.   ReuteFs Capetown agent telegraphed as follows on 21st -January : The election campaign, is in full swing, many hundreds of meetings being held every day and even in the far backfeld there is no small electoral activity. There has been no landslide to the Nationalists &quot;and the fusion of the new South African party is remarkably thorough. Former members of the South. African and of the Unionist parties are working in the utmost cordiality. It might reasonably have been expected that there would be a number of independent candidates as the result of the fusion ; but only one independent is standing at present, and it is very unlikely that there will be even one on polling day. The South African party is confident of gaining seats in Natal and the Transvaal from the Labour party, while both the South African party ,and the nationalists are likely to have gains and losses in the Butch constituencies in the Transvaal, where the last election majorities were narrow ones. In the Orange Free State province the Nationalists should again secure all the country seats, but-the South African party onght to get two in Bloemfontein. The Cape Province presents the greatest riddle : a small swing to one side or the other or the participation -of those voters who failed to poll in the last election might make a big difference in -the situation.^      ,.-r--......-  -    -      ------ -   - -.;r;&quot;;-:
The Nationalists in the Cape province are not really safe in six or seven, constituencies, although on their part they expect to gain several seats. Cautious judges to-day consider that General Smuts will,secure a small majority over all other parties. So far the Labour party candidates have been extremely: quiet, but their campaign is becoming more vigorous with the approach of polling day on 8th February..The Prime Minister is carrying on a continuous, intense and strenuous campaign, speaking two and three times or even - more often daily. To-day he is in the middle of a tour in the Cape country districts. And an unusual feature for South Africa is. that for the last two days at Aliwal North and. in the Cradock constituency, General Smuts has been unable to hold meetings owing to the rowdy tactics, of the Nationalists. The Premier, at the village of Hofmeyr, although given a tremendous reception, by a large South African party, was refused a hearing. Numbers of Nationalists persisted in hooting, causing a deafening uproar and shouting offensive epithets. General Smuts waited quietly, but as neither the chairman nor the Nationalist candidate could restore order, he left the hall followed by hundreds of his supporters. Such treatment of a Prime Minister is most unusual and. contrary to the traditional ideas of the Dutch.Sir Thomas Smartt, who has been carrying on his campaign in the south-west of&apos; the Cape province, arrived here to-day and was given an ovation. He .is supporting whole-heartedly General Smuts&apos; policy. Ministers and other leaders are touring various other districts, while General Hertzog is addressing daily meetings in- the Transvaal, dealing more vigorously with the Governments administration and its economic programme than with the question of secession. The Premier wdll arrive in. Capetown on Monday, and a tremendous popular welcome is being prepared for him.
