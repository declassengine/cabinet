The first of the following paragraphs is taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for .16th October and the rest from the Report for 23rd October :  Unemployment. Attention is still widely drawn to the unemployment position, and London is again the centre of interest. Reports continue to be received of the proposals of local authorities to put into operation, in the coming winter, public works of varying magnitude, in order to relieve such distress as may occur amongst unskilled workers and ex-service men. Many unions are actively considering their position under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.The Goal Strike. The strike notices of members of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain were allowed to expire on the 1 Oth October, and the coal strike may therefore be said to have commenced on the 18th, on which day the suspension of work in the collieries of Great Britain was complete. The decision of the Miners&apos; Federation on the 23rd September that, in the event of a strike, such work should be allowed as is necessary for maintaining the mines in condition, so that no delay need take place in resuming coal-getting at the close of the strike, has been put into operation, though in Scotland and South Wales threats to withdraw the men at work under this arrangement are reported.The coal strike affects the labour situation in two broad ways. Firstly, there is the question now being discussed by the other national bodies of organized labour, of the policy that ought to be adopted in the circumstances. Three organizations, in particular, are concerned, namely, the National Union of Railwaymen, the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. By each of these bodies very definite issues of trade union policy have to be determined. For example, in the case of the National Union of Railwaymen, local branches in Wales and district councils in Scotland are urging a sympathetic strike. Turbulent spirits may wish to exploit the disaffection of those grades of railwaymen, particularly signalmen, whose permanent wages basis has yet to be settled, and may be urging that the union&apos;s officials should take this opportunity to force an agreement. Individual railwaymen all over the country may wish for guidance as to what attitude they should adopt, for example, towards the movement of coal trains. It is because of these problems that the general meeting, the all-powerful governing body of the National Union of Railwaymen, was summoned for the 20th. The following resolution was passed by the general meeting on the 21st October: &quot; This special general meeting having carefully considered the position created by the miners&apos; strike, ancl being satisfied that their claims are reasonable and just and .should be conceded forthwith, decides to instruct the general secretary to intimate to the Prime Minister than unless the miners&apos; claims are granted, or negotiations resumed, by Saturday, 23rd October, which result in a settlement, we shall be compelled to take the necessary steps to instruct our members in England, Scotland and Wales to cease work. In addition, a telegram is being despatched to ah members to be prepared to cease work at 12 midnight on Sunday next unless they hear to the contrary.&quot; The executive of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen have similarly been in session at Leeds. The council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation have also been in session, but are more immediately concerned with the threatened strike in the road transport industry.The second way in which the coal strike affects the labour situation lies in its effect upon the unemployment position. A special emergency out-of-work donation scheme is being brought into operation for ex-members of 11.M. forces and merchant seamen, who are entitled to out-of-work donation. Persons of the age of 17 ancl over, insured under the National Insurance (Unemployment) Acts, 1911 to 1919, may also be eligible to receive unemployment benefit. The rates of emergency donation are 20s. per week for men and 15s. for women. The rate of unemployment benefit is 1 Is. for men ancl women, and half that rate for boys ancl girls. Special arrangements may be made with the larger employers for their assistance in the administration of the scheme. The necessary preparations are, of course, being made by other Government departments to meet any emergencies that may arise in the supply and transport of food and other necessaries.
Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The sub-committee, representative of -employers and operatives in the Lancashire cotton industry, who have been considering the advisability of contracting out of the Act, held a meeting on the .19th of October, when it was stated that negotiations for a scheme which would meet the views of all parties concerned had. broken down. The representatives of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations and of the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association, in an official report of the meeting, stated that, in view of the many practical difficulties involved in the administration of a contraotino--out scheme, the employers had informed the operatives that they must recommend the adoption of the Government scheme. Some dissatisfaction at this decision has been expressed by the representatives of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association.International Conference of Commercial Employees. An international conference of unions representing commercial employees has recently been held at Amsterdam. Seven countries in all were represented, namely, Great Britain (by delegates from the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers), France, Germany, Holland, Austria, Hungary and Czecho-Slovakia. It was agreed by the conference that there should in future be one international trade union representing commercial employees and that it should be based on the princinles governing the constitution of the International Federation of Trade Unions, &quot;and affiliated to this Federation. A commission representative of six countries was accordingly appointed to draw up a draft constitution for the new body, the head-quarters of which will be in Amsterdam. It was decided that next year&apos;s  congress should be held in Vienna.-COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.PALESTINE.Tlie Assembly of Palestine Jews. -On 16th October Sir Herbert Samuel trans-mitted [No. 314] the following message for the Prime Minister: The first elected assembly of Palestine Jews, convened in Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine, unanimously resolved to express their gratitude to the British Govern-ment, who, in accepting a mandate over Palestine, assured their powerful support towards the realization of the historical task of the reconstruction of a national home for the Jewish people in Erez Israel. We feel certain that under Great Britain&apos;s experienced guidance the children of Israel will return to their boundaries and that the country will develop for the benefit of all its inhabitants. (Signed) Grand Rabbi Jacob Meir.5INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xxviii, p. 4]. Telegraphing [1201 S.] on 15th October, the Viceroy announced the receipt of a letter from the Amir, and another from Mahmud Tarsi, both dated. 6th October. The former, which was telegraphed by the Viceroy in exlensp, expressed the gratification of the Amir with the reception accorded to the Afghan delegation, and with the fact that mutual misunderstanding had been removed, and the way paved to the conclusion of a treaty of friendship. In acknowledging the written statement of the proceedings at Mussoorie, the letter pointed out that there were nevertheless certain items which were not free from the possibility of complaint and objection. These, however, might be considered to be of a trivial nature, and would not conflict with the basis of questions on which it was hoped to found a treaty of friendship. Referring to Mr. Dobbs&apos; suggestion that it might be necessary to send representatives of the Indian Government to Kabul, the Amir stated that Afghanistan considered it itself equally ready and prepared with the Government of India to negotiate a treaty. The letter ended by asking that if trustworthy representatives invested with power to conclude a treaty were sent to Kabul, the Amir might be informed of the numbers, not to exceed 20, and the date of departure, in order that feelings of amity might be promoted from the first moment.
The. Viceroy sent a summary of TarsFs letter, which, after acknowledging kindnesses received at Mussoprie, refers to the Amir&apos;s letter, and the suggestion by Mr. Dobbs that a. certain Indian Moslem should, be sent. to Kabul as British agent. This had not been found acceptable, and the view of the Amir was that the personality who was sent should be an Englishman with power to sign a treaty subject to ratification. .The Viceroy proceeded to discuss the considerations for and against the proposal at some length, and gave it as the opinion of the Indian Government that after weighing all the arguments the balance was decidedly in favour of accepting the Amir&apos;s invitation, in view of the paramount importance of detaching Afghanistan as soon as possible from hostile communications. The acceptance, however, would be subject to two conditions :- (i) The position of the British Mission in Kabul would be impossible unless theywere authorized from the beginning to address the Amir officially as His Majesty, a title which other missions on the spot would be, doubtless,. , according him.(ii) The British Mission could,not be allowed to start until the release of two of&quot;our officers, who had been kidnapped by raiders, and were still detained in Kandahar in spite of Tarsi&apos;s undertaking to make enquiry about them.On 19th October the Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 2665a] to the Viceroy calling attention to a reported agreement between the Afghans and the Bolsheviks, and to the effect that this might have on any existing proposals. This telegram was. crossed by one [1214 S.] despatched on the same date by the Viceroy. In this the Viceroy stated that, according to the latest news from authentic sources, an agreement between the Afghans and the Bolsheviks might be on the verge of ratification. If this were so, the prospect of any conflict between them over the Bokhara question would disappear, and it would be unnecessary to give any immediate decision regarding a possible Afghan request for a gift of arms. The Viceroy thought it probable that the agreement would promise a regular annual subsidy to Afghanistan, and other benefits much on the lines contemplated in the British-Afghan agreement. The attitude of Afghanistan appeared to be that of seeking to gain advantages on both sides without becoming involved in any obligations directed against either. Concerning the effect of this arrangement on ourselves, the Viceroy considered that the question resolved itself into the choice between aloofness from Afghanistan, and participation with the Bolsheviks in financing the Government and in the develop-ment of the country; unless, indeed, we went to war with Afghanistan to expel the Bolsheviks&apos; influence, which might eventuate in a war with the Bolsheviks also. Of the two courses, aloofness would lead to the complete domination of Afghanistan by Bolshevik influence, whereas participation in the development of the country would gradually attract her to our sphere, owing to our superior economic strength and facilities.Exclusive domination of Afghanistan, however preferable, was now impossible without war, and the Indian Government advocated the adoption of the second&apos;of the two courses indicated above, facing all it implied with their eyes open. The Afghan acceptance of help from the Bolsheviks was not thought to preclude the carrying out of the Mussoorie programme.Before the renewal of any discussion of the agreement with Afghanistan, the Government wished to satisfy themselves as to whether an agreement with the Bol-sheviks had been actually signed, and, if so, in what way it affected our interests. They proposed, therefore, to add to the conditions given in the telegram of 15th October, governing the acceptance of the Amir&apos;s invitation, a further condition that the Afghan Government should furnish full and accurate information regarding the terms of the agreement which it was believed had already been concluded between the Afghan and the Soviet Governments, on which would depend the utility or otherwise of continuing, negotiations for a treaty of friendship between Great Britain and Afghanistan.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on 16th and 24th October: -I.(16th October.)-Gandhi is now trying to use the Home Rule League and the local -Congress committees to enforce the decisions of the Special Congress. Attention is concentrated on inducing voters not to vote. One effect of the campaign has been to adow candidates with poor chances to retire with dignity.   The leaders-
are far from unanimous, Malaviya urging that the boycott of the Councils is a mistake ; and   the moderate Press emphasizes that the nationalists, by withdrawing, merely let in moderate candidates without the trouble and expense of an election. It is impossible to estimate with any exactness the probable result of the boycott of the Councils, but so far this has proved the most successful item in the non-co-operation propaganda. The movement is spreading in Bihar, where the local Caliphate Com-mittee is carrying on an active election propaganda, in the Punjab and Bengal, where B. C. Pal ancl others are working vigorously, though Das ancl Chakravarty are criticized for inaction. In the United Provinces the provincial political conference adopted the Congress resolution with a few dissentients. An attempt to establish nationalist schools is being made in Bombay, and in Delhi arbitration courts are being-talked of, with counsel and petition writers granted sanads on payment of Rs. 50 -and Rs. 5 respectively. It remains to be seen how the experiment will work, but, as-the courts would have no power to enforce their decrees,1 it is unlikely to be extensively patronized. The impracticability of the boycott of schools is emphasized generally in the Press, as the adoption of this item of non-co-operation would mean that the leaders of the movement would have to cope with the education of eight million scholars or leave them without education.Mohamed Ali&apos;s arrival in India is giving support to the movement and may lead to an intensification of the Caliphate agitation. The visit of the Ali Brothers ancl Gandhi to Aligarh is claimed by their supporters to have had a great success. It seems probable, however, that the success has been purposely exaggerated.2. Madras reports a few more resignations from the Council candidature and of honorary offices, but local interest is concentrated on the Brahmin or non-Brahmin controversy; Caliphate agitators are adopting a social boycott against the more prominent title holders and intimidation of respectable ancl moderate Mohamedans. The boycott of foreign goods is unpopular. Lord Willingdon, at the conclusion of the Madras Legislative Council, pointed out that non-co-operation was illegal and unconstitutional, and appealed to moderate opinion to co-operate with the Govern-ment in combating it. The speech was criticized in the extremist Press but welcomed by New India.3. Bombay reports that GandbPs attempt to override the decision of the Congress through the sub-committee appointed to frame rules will strengthen the nationalists in their determination to get even with Gandhi at the next Congress. The report of the Congress Sub-Committee was received with some disappointment, as it shows that the task of confronting non-co-operar,ors involves hard work, sacrifice and money. The All-India Caliphate Committee held a meeting with a view to establishing a national educational society at Mandvis, for which Chotani is said to have received five lakhs of rupees ; and attempts were made, with some success, in spite of lower pay, to induce Hindu and Moslem teachers in the municipal vernacular schools to co-operate in the establishment of national schools. As in Madras, intimidation has been adopted to secure resignation of titles. The moderates, however, stirred to action, are reported to be initiating a scheme of propaganda and to be holding a conference, over which Sir Chiman Lai Setalvad, who resigned from the High Court, will preside.-Many seats areuucontested in Bombay owing to the withdrawal, of Congress candidates. For two seats in the India Legislative Assembly allotted to the general electorate of Bombay citizens only Sir Chiman Lai Setalvad and Jainnados Dwarkadas have been nominated. We proscribed the Daily Herald and prohibited its entry into India under the Sea Customs Act, owing to its Bolshevik propaganda. The proscription was protested against in the extremist Press, and the Daily Herald Support Committee -constituted with Baptista as president.4. In the Punjab, wdiile the Caliphate agitation is quiescent, the agitation among the Sikhs is intensified ancl the non-co-operation movement is securing. a stronger hold. The Sikh agitators have been conducting a violent campaign in the urban and the rural areas. The concessions to Sikh sentiment made by the Government in the observance of the Sikh festivals as holidays, permission to wear kirpans, and reforms in the management of the golden temple at Amritsar, have only encouraged them to make further demands ; the dangerous features of the movement are the threats of violence and the incitement to the people to prepare for the defiance of authority. The prosecution of individuals under the ordinary law is considered by the Local Government Undesirable, because (1) such prosecutions arouse considerable excitement, necessitating in one case the pronouncement of judgment in jail, and in another holding the trial in jail; and (2) the appearance of initiating a crusade against 21-4 B   -
the Sikhs . should be avoided. At the request of the lieutenant-Govern or we have-authorized the application of the. Seditions Meetings Act to the districts of Lahore Amritsar and Sheikhpara, though the proclamation will only be made if considered absolutely necessary. In view of the liberty of speech enjoyed in the large towns, the cities of Lahore and Amritsar will be exempt, and steps will be taken not to interfere with ordinary meetings of a religious character, or electioneering meetings, provided that moderate language is used and that they are not held for the purpose of exciting hatred between communities and the Government. A circular has been issued in the Punjab with a view to counteracting the undesirable features of the early stages of the non-co-operation programme. District officers are encouraged to discuss political matters with the leaders of the rural classes and to take no action calculated to alienate their sympathy, and, as regards the educated classes, to encourage men (? of) reasonable opinions to influence the extreme politicians in pointing out the dangers of the non-co-operation movement.5. The latest report from Assam shows deterioration in the situation in that province, influenced probably by the judgement in the Kharial case. At the Surma Valley Conference great rancour and bitterness were shown, the coolie girl involved in the case being put on the platform. The non-co-operation resolution was passed unanimously, the majority being in favour of a concerted boycott of schools and courts ; resolutions were also passed advocating complete non-co-operation with and boycott of European merchants and planters, and that no welcome should be accorded to his Excellency the Viceroy during his visit. Twelve members of local boards and municipalities have announced resignation of their seats. The Kharial murder case attracted wide notice in the Press. Read was charged under section 326, Indian Penal Code. The jury returned a unanimous verdict of &quot;Not guilty.&quot; A petition was submitted to the Chief Commissioner praying him to appeal against the acquittal. The Chief Commissioner, in reviewing the evidence, found genuine room for doubt and declined to appeal. It has been turned into a racial question and taken up by the Amritsa Bazaar Patrika and similar papers. The riot in tea gardens, reported in a previous weekly telegram, seems to have involved some 10,000 persons. The movement was carefully planned with a view to making an effective demonstration at one garden after another. Though advantage was taken of the opportunity to molest unpopular members of the garden staff and even to loot traders&apos; shops, no special animosity was indicated against Europeans as such, or against the Government. The assault on S.P. was probably not premeditated. The trouble was clue to high prices, combined probably with the reduction in amount of overtime earnings clue to the slump in the tea market.6. The Bombay postal strike continues. The Calcutta tramway strike has ended,, but the Bombay gas workers and the Calcutta gas workers are both on strike. The cities are lighted by candles and acetylene flares. A lightning strike occurred among 10,000 employees of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway Company, disorganizing the train service temporarily. It was said to be due to the dismissal of certain employees. The strike was settled by the agent, the employees promising to return to work, receiving strike pay, and [putting their claims before the agent, who will consider them.II. (24th October). The. most important events of the week have been the visit of Gandhi and the Ali brothers to Ali gar h and Lucknow. The former visit has caused a serious situation in the Aligarh college ; the students, after some opposition, presented an ultimatum to the principal and trustees demanding the resignation of&quot; titles and the renunciation of Government grants. Shaukat Ali promised the support of one crore rupees from private sources. A reply was demanded by 29th October. The principal has called a meeting of the trustees for 27th October and has addressed, the parents, summoning them to Aligarh to control the students. The syndicate has been holding daily sittings and has announced its determination to uphold the principles on which Syed Ahmecl based the institution. The-syndicate notified that no-one should address the college students inside the college without the previous written permission of the principal, but two outside maulvis preached to the students, yesterday without permission. The United Provinces Government has been asked for a full appreciation of the situation. Meantime, we have private information that the students are beginning to regret the action taken, and parental influence is beginning to make itself felt. The latest report states that about 70 parents have taken boys home to await the decision of the trustees. Two hundred parents have--written disapproving of the action of Gandhi, the Ali-brothers and the students, and.
asking that their sons be sent home. The Bhopal State has temporarily withdrawn all the Bhopal students. Telegrams and letters have been received from old boys and friends from many quarters expressing strong disapproval of the incident. The parents passed a resolution urging the trustees to take immediate effective steps to exclude outsiders from visiting the college, and the honorary secretary and principal urge parents to take immediate charge of the boys to avoid unforeseen consequences.2. At Lucknow on 15th October Gandhi made a speech in Hindustani before ah audience of some forty to fifty thousand. He advised the organization of Hindustan into a large lashkar practising discipline. Islam was at stake, and Indians slaves under the present Government. But armed resistance was impossible because the Hindus, though the possession of swords was not forbidden, had been rendered cowards by the Government snatching away arms. Non-co-operation was the only means of ending the slavery. The Government was devilish; co-operation with it sinful. He condemned the Willoughby murder and said : &quot; When we shall use swords we shall warn Europeans, women and children.&quot; He denounced recruiting for the Army, compared the Government to dacoit, and promised, swaraj within a year if his policy were followed. The Local Government report that the masses are unaffected and that the meeting was conspicuous for the absence of many leading men. The agitators are reported to be worried at the reception of Gandhi in the United Provinces. The Lieutenant-Governor will telegraph further on the advisability of a prosecution later.3. Madras. Non-co-operation is reported as not making much headway. No further resignations of titles have been received. Meetings held in Madras to further the programme are not attracting large audiences, and the local leader in an intercepted letter to Shaukat Ali asks him to seud Mahomed Ali to help the cause. The Odinmittee&apos;s activities are in the direction of threatening opponents with social ostracism.4. Bombay.-We have received the following information regarding the proceed-ings of the All-India Congress Committee of 2nd October and the Home Rule League Meeting of 3rd October. The former was attended by 35 only out of 121 members, of whom 28 were from Bombay and Madras. The latter was attended by 61 members only out of the All-India total of 6,000.Although the All-India Congress Committee accepted Gandhi&apos;s interpretation and the scope of the Congress resolution passed in Calcutta, the statement issued to the Press merely contained instructions based on GanclbFs report, and the popular belief is that the matter is a magnificent triumph for him. The meeting of the All-India Home Rule League was a stormy one; the main item of discussion was its present constitution, which is clearly permissive of unconstitutional and illegal action against the creed of the Congress, to which the League is an affiliated body. A further clause mentions &quot; (? unlimited) complete&quot; swarajya in accordance with the wishes of the people, but restricted to the definition in Article 1 of the Congress constitution. A strong suspicion has manifested itself that mental reservation was behind this clause, permitting complete independence if necessary. Gandhi had a majority of 42 to 19, and declared the proposition carried in spite of a strong protest that the constitution required a three-quarters majority. Jinnah and 19 influential members have resigned, and more are expected to follow. The general belief was that Jinnah and his party were (? justly) (? over) suspicious, and that the feeling against Gandhi will probably be increased through confirmation of the suspicion of the opposition by the resolution passed by the Moradabad Provincial Congress, which Gandhi attended, recommending modification of Article I of the Congress constitution, that the goal of India is attainment of swaraj in accordance with the wishes of the people. All-Indian constituencies have nominated candidates, although many, especially in Gujarat, wobbled till the last moment; it is left to be seen how they will meet the final onslaught of Gandhi, and of the nationalists who are organising a final extensive campaign in Gujarat and the Deccan. It is not expected that the votes recorded will be large owing to ignorance and apatly. Gandhi is pushing the boycott of the schools zealously in Guj arat, and has met with certain degrees of success at Gujarat and Ahmadabad, but especially at Nadiad, where the local municipality has been induced to refuse a grant from Government and a private high school has been forced to refuse grant-in-aid..5. Bengal.-The non-co-operative movement has not made any appreciable progress. Gandhi&apos;s attempt to hedge on the question of the boycott of foreign goods is calculated to appeal to his Marwari supporters in Calcutta, but not to further the
cause among the extremist leaders. There are signs of a split among the latter. Malaviya&apos;s lead referred to in last week&apos;s telegram attracted a good deal of attention, and found some followers, foremost among whom is 1. B. Sen.This section of extremists have drawn up schemes for improving sanitation and industry in villages, hut the details and the exact nature of ihe policy and extent of the breach with non-co-operation is not yet clear. There have been a few fresh instances of practical non-co-operation such as one or two resignations from Provincial Councils, district boards, &amp;c. On the other hand, the Nawab of Dacca has issued a declaration condemning non-co-operation and withdrawing his support of the movement. The provincial Caliphate committee is organizing propaganda amongst the masses. An office has been opened, over 100 volunteers have offered themselves, including many released detenus, and Abul Kalam Ayad is to supervise at a salary of Rs. 800 a month. A more serious development is the formation of a body of 100 volunteers professing themselves ready to sacrifice their lives in the cause of the community, a scheme avowedly borrowed from Egypt and Ireland, with the object of committing overt acts such as cutting telegraph wires and upsetting railway trains. Canvassing by J. N. Roy led to the formation of the Raiyats Association, which is likely to develop on the economic side with&apos; a view to resisting illegal demands by landlords.6. United Provinces. For Gandhi&apos;s visit to Aligarh and his Lucknow speech see paragraph 1. The provincial conference which met at Moradabad passed a resolution in favour of non-co-operation, which is now loudly and almost unanimously advocated by the advanced section of the Press.The agitation is acute and shows no sign of abatement. A Caliphate lecturer has been convicted in PTardoi under sections 124a and 153a, and sentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment, and. a second agitator is being prosecuted in the same district. The prosecutions are reported to have had a good effect and to be likely to check the spread of the agitation in small towns and villages..7. Delhi. The national court referred to last week is now sitting, but is regarded as a jest: cognisable cases are not dealt with. Asaf Ali, a briefless barrister, is anxious to be appointed chief judge on 11s. 2,000, but fees will not run to this. The cause list shows five or six cases, the subject-matter of all being either divorce or the recovery of lost women. The defendant in a civil case appealed to the National Court, and a notice was issued to the decree holder, who laughed ancl tore it up.More serious is the National Volunteer movement. Recruiting for this is brisk and parades are held daily in. increasing numbers.One hundred cloth dealers of the city, alarmed and annoyed by the fall in the exchange, have resolved not to take up any British jorders except at a rate of not less than 2s. to the rupee. This movement is causing much dislocation and distress for European importing firms.THE DOMINIONS.Proposed Meeting of ihe Imperial Cabinet. On 13th October the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following message from Mr. Lloyd George to the Governors-General of Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, for transmission to their Prime Ministers : I have been anxious for some time that we should renew that personal consultation between Prime Ministers which was productive of such good results in the last two years of the war and at Paris. I fully realize that the British Government, in the absence of such consultation and of some machinery for giving it more continuity, must inevitably tend to take upon itself the responsibility for settling the many urgent questions of foreign policy which arise from day to day and which require immediate decision, but which yet often involve consequences by which the whole Empire is vitally affected. This I feel to be fair neither to the Dominions nor to the British Government. I know also that there are many other matters of common interest, which call for consultation and decision.I have received from the Prime Minister of Australia a telegram in which similar views are expressed, ancl he urges that a meeting of the Imperial Cabinet should be held next year.
I would therefore suggest that we should hold a. meeting of the Imperial Cabinet not later thafl June next year on the liines of the Imperial War Cabinet meetings in 1917-18. At such a meeting we&apos;could as far as possible clear the decks of the more, urgent problems which will have . accumulated, and we could try to devise Some practical working method for arriving at a common imperial policy in foreign affairs. The composition, agenda, and meeting place of the Constitutional Conference, which it was contemplated in 1917 should be held immediately after the war, but which I incline to think could hardly be held with advantage till public opinion in the Empire has had time to give somewhat more attention to the whole problem, could also be discussed.Will you please let me know whether you can attend such a meeting of the. Imperial Cabinet and whether the approximate date which. I have suggested would be. convenient to yon ?The Postal Congress. On 19th October the Secretary of State informed the Governors-General of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the Officer adminis-tering the Government of South Africa that the chief United Kingdom delegate at the Postal Congress at Madrid had reported that the following resolution had been proposed in committee by the Swiss delegate and carried by .17 votes to 16 : Correspondence d deeoiivert and closed mails in transit are inviolable either by sea or land.   Consequently no country belonging to the Union may subject them to censorship or sequestration even in the case of war.   The same applies to correspondence directly exchanged between two countries by sea ;: granting that in case of seizure of a ship having correspondence on hoard the captor must forward such correspondence with the least possible delay.   The regulations of maritime law as to the violation of blockade are reserved. Lord Milner went on to say that all ex-enemy and neutral States on the Committee voted for this, together with the United States of America, Portugal, Brazil and Jugo-Slavia.   Japan and Belgium did not. vote.   The United Kingdom and. the British Dominions, France and French Colonies, the Belgian Congo and the remaining allied countries voted against it.   The success of the resolution was unexpected, and it is understood that there is every chance of its being rejected when it comes&apos; before the full Congress.   The British representatives at Brussels, Tdkio, Belgrade and Lisbon have been instructed to inform&apos; the respective Governments of the opposition1 of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Swiss proposals and to express the hope that they will at once instruct their delegates to vote against them.   The United Kingdom delegates have been instructed? to get into touch with the representatives of the countries which have not yet voted and to endeavour to gain theiis-support.   If the&apos; above action proves inadequate and there should be- any likelihood of the Swiss, proposals being adopted, the United. Kingdom delegates have been instructed to make it clear that, although we should be loath to break up the Congress, we can under ho&apos; circumstances admit the right of such a body to decide questions affecting belligerents, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part will be compelled to regard any decision reached by the Congress on such matters as null and void.   It is earnestly hoped that the Dominion Governments will instruct their delegates in similar sense.In reply to the above the following telegrams have been received :  (1) From the Governor-General of&apos; Canada, dated 24th October :  My Ministers represent that the following telegraphic instructions were sent on. 22nd October through the&apos;Secretary for the Post Office, London, to the Canadian, delegates at the Conference: Please transmit to the Canadian delegates, Madrid Postal Conference, the following urgent message:   The Government of Canada, instructs you to vote against the- proposal made by Switzerland that mails, in . transit shall be inviolable in case of war, and to tafte the ground that the Postal Congress has no right to decide matters relating to belligerents, and that any decision arrived at by the Conference on such matters is null and void in as far as can be ascertained Canada is concerned! ...(2) From the Governor-General of Australia, dated 22nd October :-The Australian delegate has been instructed to oppose the resolution affirming, the inviolability on sea or land of correspondence a deebuvert and closed mails in transit, and also otherwise&apos; to adopt the same attitude as the &quot;United Kingdom delegates in this matter.21-4 .&apos;   0&apos; .. \:,y: -rjiii tj.V3.:i

(3) From the Governor-General of New Zealand,-, dated 21st October:-&apos; My..Government agree with the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards tbe resolution in question, and the New Zealand delegate has been instructed by telegraph to confer with the delegates [? of the United Kingdom] and to act strictly in concert with them. ,&apos;   CANADA.Baaon [B.E.R., xxvii, p. 8].-The following message from the Prime Minister of Canada, sent through the Governor-General, was received on 17th October :-I regret that my telegram of 18th September is not fully answered by your telegram of 25th September; also that the recommendations that Canadian bacon, should be decontrolled as to distribution, and that the selling price, should be agreed to month by month by representatives of the Canadian Government and the British Ministry of Food, have not been adopted or even dealt with. I also regret that no information is given as to when control will cease. The statement of the Ministry of Food that they have always paid higher price for Canadian than for American bacon is not correct, as prior to control Canadian bacou was selling on the English market at 10s. per cwt. over American. Nevertheless the British Ministry paid a less price during the winter 1920 for Canadian than for American bacon, taking into consideration the rate of exchange. Our information is that the Ministry of Food has. used Canadian bacon for the purpose of disposing of stale American, by selling it with American bacon to detract from the Canadian industry. The question of the Ministry paying less for Danish than Canadian is not relevant, as the Ministry paid last winter much less for Canadian than for Danish. During September deliveries of hogs have been very low, being 40 per cent, less than during the same month last year ; hence prices have been running high. The present shortage and high price are largely due to the action of the Ministry last autumn, whereas an arbitrary buying price was fixed regardless of the cost of production by the Ministry. Canadian packers advise that no offer has been received to buy September bacon and that they have not been asked to report their production to the Ministry&apos;s office (?) in New York. The cost of September production singed Wiltshire bacon is 37 cents at montreal. I believe that the Ministry of Food should pay this price and should authorize its New York representative immediately to take up the matter of price for October, November and December with the Canadian Government and packers. It is important that immediate attention should be given to the whole matter.Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs : (1) The grain yield this year is estimated to amount to approximately 1,000,000,0U0 bushels, and the probable aggregate value of the entire agricultural production some $3,000,000,000.(2) During the seven months ended 31st July, 1,000,000 tons more coal was-produced in Alberta than the output amounted to for the corresponding period last year.NEW ZEALAND.Freight Rales [B.E.R., xxvi, p. 9]. On 14th October the Secretary of State replied as follows to the Governor-general&apos;s telegram of 8th September :-The Food Controller states that, under the agreement made with the Australasian lines, the charter rate for refrigerated space was fixed at 132s. Qd. per 40 cubic feet, to hold good for 12 months from 1st March 1919, either party being entitled to review the rate on 1st March 1920 on giving three months&apos; previous notice. In December 1919 the Australasian lines gave notice to review and eventually claimed an increase to 150s., basing their case on the general increase in running and other expenses, and putting forward, among other figures, statements, duly certified by accountants, of the increased cost of operatingvessels on the Australasian route, which showed an average increase of 20,176L, or 38 per cent., for the round voyage, in the running expenses of a steamer which sailed January 1920 as. against the same steamer in 1919. After an exhaustive discussion between the Board of Trade, the Food Ministry, and the Australasian lines, a compromise was effected, and it was agreed that the charter rate should be raised to 144s. as from 1st March 1920.   As regards non-refrigerated space
SOUTH AFRICA.League of Nations Assembly. On 15th October the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General hoping that the South African Govem-ment could arrange to be represented at the Assembly of the League of Nations. The Australian delegate would, he said, arrive about 1st November, and it was hoped that the Canadian delegation would arrive about the same time. New Zealand would be represented by her High Commissioner.Enemy Tonnage. The Officer administering the Government transmitted to the . Secretary of State the following message from his Prime Minister on 15th October : The Ministry of Shipping has informed the High Commissioner for South Africa, that the Union of South Africa is not expected to make any claims upon enemy tonnage which has been handed over since the armistice, in view of the fact that the Reparation Commission accept losses in tonnage as the basis for distributing such tonnage and South Africa has suffered no such losses.   The application of the above principle the Shipping Controller has no control over the rates which are fixed by the liner conferences.Butter [B.E.R., xxviii, p. 10].-On 18th October the Secretary of State for the Colonies transmitted the following message from the Food Controller to the Governor-General in reply to the lattePs telegraphed on 9th October : The Ministry of Food is unable to grant an increase of price in New Zealand butter graded over 88 points ; the present offer is closely based on the retail price of 3s. 4d. per pound. The increase of la, Qd. per point to Australia for butter graded 91 to 94 points merely ensures for the best quality the price paid for first-grade New Zealand; namely, 141. (280s.). Premiums for butter graded over 90 points were paid -under the old contracts to Australia. The Ministry agrees that the free storage given by factories shall be six weeks only instead of two months aw before. The Ministry agrees that the price for whey, dairy ancl milled butter should be arrived at by deducting from the first grade creamery price the same amount per lb. as was deducted last season. Concerning a free market, the New Zealand Government will appreciate that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot give so far ahead the unqualified guarantee required (demanded), but the Food Controller repeats the assurances given in preceding telegrams and hopes to be able to make about the end of January a definite announcement of a free market in butter in Great Britain about May or June on the same terms for imported butter as for British and Irish. Similar treatment for home ancl overseas butter is impracticable at present as a business proposition. In the year 1918 an attempt to collect British butter for distribution by ,the Ministry failed, and the control of British butter was maintained by maximum prices only. The Anti-Profiteering Act, which is still in force, applies to British and Irish butter. All New Zealand butter offered on the Imperial Government terms will be accepted by the Ministry up to the end of December, but the Ministry will not guarantee the acceptance of deliveries after the end of December from any producers not formally accepting the Imperial Government terms now for deliveries up to the. end of March.In a telegram sent in reply to this on 23rd October, Lord Jellicoe reported that his Prime Minister had stated that the butter producers referred to in the last paragraph of his telegram of 9th October were now almost certain to accept the offer of the Imperial Government in conjunction with the remaining butter producers of New Zealand ; and the Prime Minister anticipated being able to intimate a definite generai acceptance of the purchase in the course of a few days.. Wool. The Governor-General telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State on 21st October: While the Government of New Zealand recognizes that the Imperial Government has shown no desire to unduly force its holdings of wool on the market, my Prime Minister would be pleased to receive an assurance that the Imperial Govern-ment will hold its stocks firmly and only place them on the market in such quantities as would enable them to be absorbed without seriously depressing prices. My Government believe that this would steady the position and restore confidence throughout the whole industry, and ultimately benefit both the Imperial Government ancl New Zealand, as any further serious decline in crossbred values would be likely to have grave and far-reaching consequences.
of distribution to the Dominions would be/manifestly unfair in view of their sacrifices, and the Union Government submit that the division of such tonnage amongst the nations of the British Empire should, in addition to (be principle of ton for ton lost, have regard also to other considerations such as the vessels captured off the shores of the Dominions and detained and interned in the Dominion ports. The Union would only waive her claims to the above tonnage if vessels so captured or detained were allotted to her. Otherwise she trusts that until it has been decided at the next Imperial Conference or earlier the question will remain open.The- Orange&quot; Free State &quot; Nationalist Congress. Renter&apos;s Bloemfontein corre-correspondent reported on 19th October that General Hertzog, addressing the Free State Nationalist Congress that clay, had protested strongly against the action of the Government in &quot; binding South Africa to its own detriment.&quot;&apos; He declared that the Ministers were not doing their duty by their people. They had refused to create a wool market with Germany and other countries, primarily because they had bound themselves to help England..General de Wet also complained of the lack of harmony between the Government and the nation. Referring to the question of &apos;South African independence, he declared, amid applause, if he died next day he should die with the belief that his nation would yet cross the Jordan.On 21st October, Reuter&apos;s Capetown correspondent telegraphed that the Orange Free State Nationalist Congress had that day vigorously protested against the policy of state-aided immigration ; and that General Hertzog had expressed his disagreement with the whole policy of the Government in connexion with the granting of preference for ex-servicemen.And on 22nd October the Capetown correspondent further reported that at the Free State Nationalist Congress that day General Hertzog had moved the following resolutions, which were adopted as a supplement to the principles of the Nationalist party: -That this Congress, in view of the fundamental principles of the Nationalist party, namely, South Africa first, decides to accept the following principles : (1) The Nationalists acknowledge and will safeguard the sovereign will of the people of the Union.(2) The Nationalists acknowledge the right of the people of the Union to self-determination, t(3) The Nationalists acknowledge the right of the people of the Union to secede from Great Britain and break any existing bond between, the Union and Great Britain..(4) The- Nationalists declare against and will oppose any attempt at a closer imperial union..(5) As regards republican propaganda the Congress opines that no one may be hindered, or prevented from a free expression of his convictions concerning the advisability of one form or other of government for the country.(6) The Republicans will not attempt to realize that ideal in any but a constitutional way.. This Congress considers that no decisive step as regards secession should be taken unless a majority of the people legally entitled to vote declare by means of a referendum or otherwise in favour of secession.NEWFOUNDLAND.Wireless Communications [B.E.R., xxviii. p. 12]. In reply to the Governors telegram of 12th. October, the Secretary of State informed him on 18th October that important questions in connexion with the erection of wireless stations throughout the Empire were under consideration, and that decisions were hoped for at an early date. He suggested that meantime the Newfoundland Government should not commit themselves to anything.
