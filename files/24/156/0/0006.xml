ADEN.Oolonel Jacob&apos;* Miss-ion. On 28th November the Resident at Aden reported [no number] that he had received a telegram, dated 20th November, from Major Meek, transmitting a message from Colonel Jacob in regard to the aeroplane demon-stration over Baji. Colonel Jacob stated that this had caused very great excitement and had led. to the surrounding of their house by hundreds of maddened tribesmen who were armed and had fired at them. They would, he said, certainly have been killed, but for the intervention of Syed Abdul Nadir, the Vali, and the Duhra Shayks. Colonel Jacob added that the sending of aircraft did not advance their cause one iota and he emphatically begged that no more might be sent.The Resident added that Major Meek was of opinion that the further use of aeroplanes would imperil the mission, and he was therefore giving instructions that they should not be again used for ten days, when there would&quot; be a further flight and bombs dropped for the purpose of demonstration only, the tribes being warned that no damage was intended and that they were responsible for the safety of the mission.Telegraphing again on 1st December [no number],he reported the receipt of another telegram, dated. 30th November, from Major Meek, saying that Colonel Jacob and Mr. Redly had reported that the aeroplane demonstration had produced excellent results and brought about a great advance towards a settlement. The Resident noted that this was in conflict with their previous report.On 4th December Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 1661] suggesting that the aerial demonstrations should be restricted to simple flights because of the risk of accidental casualties from a bomb-dropping display. Lord Ourzon approved this suggestion on 9th December [No. 1313].MALTA.German Prisoners of War. On 27th November [No. 717] Sir George Buchanan reported that the Italian Government had replied that they had no objection to repatriate the Austro-Hungarian prisoners now interned in. Malta, Egypt, and India through Italian territory. They agreed to their disembarkation at either Trieste or Venice provided that the conditions already made known were observed. They added that the authorities of Venice were taking the necessary steps for the disembarkation of the prisoners and for the continuation of their journey by rail.I.1 wo days later he reported [No. 727] that the Governor of Malta had telegraphed that the Government of Malta would have an opportunity of repatriating a certain number of German prisoners of war who were willing to pay their own expenses if allowed to proceed through Italy. The Governor considered it of great importance for them, to be repatriated, and had asked, film, to use his influence with the Italian Government to obtain the necessary permission. Sir George asked for an early reply to his telegram [No. 717] of 27th November.EGYPT.The American Recognition of the British Protectorate. On 1st December Lord Curzon telegraphed to Lord Grey [No. 2150],. sending him the following text of the American recognition of the British Lh-otectorato in Egypt, contained, in a letter sent by Mr. Lansing to Mi-. Balfour last April:-In answer to your enquiry, the President has authorized me to inform you that he&apos;recognizes the British Protectorate of Egypt, which was announced by His Majesty&apos;s Government on ISth December 191.4.
The President has no objection, to this decision being made public, as he under-stands that it may help in the restoration of order and in the prevention of further bloodshed in Egypt. You will no doubt realize, my dear Mr. Minister, that in accord with this recognition the President must necessarily reserve for further discussion the details of the formal recognition, together with the question of a modification of any right of the United States which this decision on his part may entail. Lord Curzon added that the above did not imply any modification oE recognition, or the possibility of a further discussion of the principle, and could only be inter-preted in connexion with the formula to be used modifying the rights of United States citizens in Egypt in consequence of such recognition.INDIA.The Caliphate Question. On 25th November the Viceroy reported that the Caliphate question was still arousing intense interest and with it frequent discussion of the propriety of holding peace celebrations. The Hindu extremists had taken up the Caliphate question, emphasizing the essential unity of Hindus and Mohammedans. The extremists of both communities in the United Provinces, Bombay, and Punjab opposed peace celebrations : the moderates everywhere were not enthusiastic, but would not abstain. High prices and the present inability to spend money were a contributory factor.The Hunter Committee. -The Viceroy also reported that the Hunter Committee had concluded its enquiry into the Ainritsar disturbances. The Congress was still boycotting the Committee, but moderate opinion inclined to think this was a mistake. Bengal had intimated this clearly. That day, 25th November, the enquiry was to begin into the Lahore disturbances.The Congress. In the same telegram the Viceroy further reported that Pandit Motilal Nehru had been elected President; the public generally, he said, was taking-less interest in the Congress than in the Caliphate and the Hunter Committee.General. The Viceroy also reported that Jinnah had arrived in India and had advised non-participation in the peace celebrations. Andrews had left India for a few months&apos; visit to Souih Africa.Reforms. The Viceroy also reported that the summary of the Joint Committee&apos;s recommendations had been published. They had been well received by Sapru, Jinnah and the Leader newspaper, Allahabad, and (? severely) criticized by the Calcutta European Press, but there had been no discussion as yet in the extremist Press.The Toehi Waziris. On 19th November the Viceroy reported [No. 274a] that on the 17th the terms offered had been accepted by a representative jirga of the Toehi Waziris ; part of the fine had been paid and some rifles handed over.Economic Conditions. On 21st November the Viceroy reported as follows:  Several relief camps were closed in Hyderabad, where number on relief decreasing. Numbers relieved: Bihar and Orissa : works, 70; gratuitous, 26,111. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 2,626; gratuitous, 602. Central India: works, 3,400; gratuitous, 4,700. Hyderabad : works, 12,000 ; gratuitous, 11,000. Madras (incomplete figures): works, 49,337 ; gratuitous 74,432.And again on 28th November as follows: Famine operations have been practically closed in Bihar and Orissa, and famine conditions are disappearing in Hyderabad, where village gratuitous relief has been stopped. In Madras the famine operations are closed in Udayagiri Taiuka and are being closed in other areas. Numbers on relief: Burma: works, 1,450; gratuitous, 100. Bihar and Orissa: gratuitous, 22,177. Feudatory States of Orissa, report not received. Central India :. works, 3,300 ; gratuitous, 4,700. Hyderabad: works, 10,000; gratuitous, 8,000. Madras : works, 32,97S ; gratuitous (incomplete figures), 56,894. 6-2 A 2
And. again.on 5th December as follows: All relief works have been closed in Bunclelkhand. Distress has considerably decreased in Hyderabad, where relief works continue in one district only. Numbers relieved:   Burma: works, 2,775; gratuitous, 10. Bihar and Orissa : gratuitous, 13,730. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 567 ; gratuitous, 33. Central India: gratuitous, 1,500. Hyderabad : &quot;works, 7,000; gratuitous, 5,000.   Madras: works, 27,349; gratuitous. 54,546.Afghan desire, to have a Consul-General at Peshawar. On 24th November the Viceroy reported. [No. 1592S.] that letters had been, received from Mahmud Tarsi intimating that it was considered necessary to appoint a Consul-General at PeshaAvar and that All Ahmad Khan had been appointed to the post. The Foreign Secretary had replied that the request could not be granted; the creation of consular posts required the sanction of the British Government, and therefore Ahmad Ah, who had reached India, could assume neither the title nor the office.North-Wast Frontier. Telegraphing on 7th December the Viceroy stated that the reports of Afghan activities on the frontier conflict so much that it is difficult to distinguish the truth from falsehood. He gave a summary of information to the effect that the Waziris were being encouraged by Shah Daula who had remained at Wana, and had promised them military assistance. Frequent reports had been received of the arrival of Afghan reinforcements in Khost, but it had been suggested-that these forces were intended only to bring the depleted Afghan frontier garrisons up to strength. It was probable that there had been some Afghan military activity on the frontier with the object of encouraging the tribes against us, but no overt action had taken place to which exception could be taken.THE DOMINIONS.Imperial Sea Covvmnnic.ations.-Oa 27th November Lord .Milfier telegraphed to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and to the Governor of Newfoundland, in regard to the completion of the arrangements for the establishment of a body to&apos;deal with the question of Imperial sea communications. To the regret of His &quot;Majesty&apos;s Government the urgent pressure of other public business had hitherto stood in the way of its establishment, but it was hoped to call it together in the immediate future. This body is to be called the Imperial Shipping Committee.   A similar communication had already been made to Canada.AUSTRALIA.Shipping Space for Rabbits. On 2nd December the Governor-General of Australia transmitted a message from his Prime Minister in regard to the insufficient refrigerated space for rabbits. He said that the Commonwealth Government was being severely condemned on account of it, and he strongly urged that the matter should receive immediate attention. As things stood thousands would be thrown out of work and large sums of money would be lost.Purchase of Meat by the British Government. On 26th November lord Milner informed the Governor-General of Australia that the Board of Trade, to whom the matter had been referred, were anxious that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth should understand that it was doubtful whether&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to enter into any fresh contract for the purchase of meat.from Australia.Rice Supply. A telegram from the Governor-General of the Commonwealth, dated 9th November, states that he has informed the Viceroy of India that the requirements of Australia and the adjacent Pacific Islands, where rice is an essential food for the natives, during the coining importing season, will be 46,000 tons of Burmah rice. On behalf of the rice-importing firms of Australia, he has asked that a licence for the exportation of tins,quantity be granted immediately. The Governor-General has pointed out that during the present year no rice from India was made available for Commonwealth requirements, and that the limited stocks obtained from
Coohin. China and elsewhere at considerably increased prices were rapidly rearing exhaustion. -He had. further urged that when Indian requirements had been met, preference should be given to Ithe Dominions, and particularly to those which had been precluded from sharing in the distribution of last seasons harvest. The Government of the ;Gommonwealth would .appreciate any assistance the Secretary&apos;of State for -the Colonies could, afford in obtaining ithe licence for the export of the quantity required.NEW ZEALAND..Purchase of Meat by British Gow-rnmenb. On 26th November Lord; -Milner informed the Governor-General of New Zealand that the Board of Trade were anxious that his Ministers should know that it was doubtful whether His Majesty&apos;s Goyern-ment would be prepared to enter into any now contract for the purchase of New Zealand meat.SOUTH AFRICA.The Asiatic Problem.  Reutets Agent reported from Ladysnhth on 23rd November that the Minister of Railways, Mr. Burton, referring to the Asiatic question in the course of a speech there, said he thought a good deal of misunderstanding had arisen regarding his speech at the Imperial War Conference in 1918. The Secretary of State for India had complained that what occurred in the Union Parliament was a departure from Mr. Burton&apos;? attitude, but the fact was, Mr. Burton said, that nothing in the Governments present attitude was inconsistent with what he then said. The Governments.policy was still to be just, fair and sympathetic in dealing with Asiatics, but, of course, they had also to remember their duty in dealing justly and fairly with the country&apos;s national future.The South African. Diamond Industry. - Renter&apos;s Agent reported on 23rd November, from Johannesburg, that at a banquet of the South African Institution of Engineers, the Minister of Mines, Mr. Malan, made an important announcement regarding the diamond, industry. He stated that a conference of four groups of producers, representatives of the Union Government and representatives of South-VV.est Africa, had unanimously decided to control the supply of diamonds, and had arrived at an agreement whereby the workVs markets would be supplied in the following percentages: De Beers, 51; Premier, 18; Jagersfontein, 10; South-West Protectorate, 21. The amount supplied would be based on the actual sales of the preceding three months. This agreement, Mr. Malau said, would give stability to the market and would lie to the best interest of everybody concerned. Furthermore, the conference was unanimously in favour of disposal through one channel, and, after prolonged negotiations, the offer of a London syndicate had been accepted.The arrangement was. that the basic price should be fixed every quarter and the syndicate would pay the producers 5 per cent, less than the average price obtained in the preceding quarter. Five per cent, above the basic price would go to the syndicate, while the additional proceeds were to be equally divided between producer and syndicate. Both contracts arc for five years, but are&apos; terminable at the end of two years. The producers expressed the opinion that the latter contract was the best they would ever be able to make. Mr. Malan explained the Governments attitude to the amalgamation, which lias been arranged between several diamond-mining companies operating in the South-West Protectorate, and pointed out that the arrangement had been, conducted secretly because it was carried out between two private parties. He emphasized, in this connexion, that the Union Government had not parted with any of its assets.Replying to questions whether the diamond fields of South-West Africa would be worked, Mr. Malan pointed out that the sales of diamonds from the South-West Protectorate at present amounted to two-and-a-half millions annually, of which the Government took 60 per cent. The Government had told the syndicate that, as a condition precedent to the-Governments approval; the&apos;: South-West mines must bo worked to the best advantage of the Union&apos; Government and the Protectorate. Moreover, those investing three-and-a-half million pounds in those fields would require, a return on their money.
General Hertzog in Johannesburg. On 20th November Renter&apos;s Agent reported from J ohannesburg that there were several unpleasant incidents there during the day and evening in connexion with the Nationalist celebrations to welcome General Hertzog on his return from Europe. In the evening a Nationalist meeting at the Town Hall occasioned considerable excitement, thousands gathering in the street outside, signing &quot; Rule Britannia&quot; and the National Anthem. Several fights occurred and the windows of the Nationalist Club were broken. A heavy shower of rain put an end to a threatening situation.General Hertzog, in his speech at the Town Hall claimed that the cause for which he was fighting was the same as that for which his English friends were fighting and sooner or later the English would recognize that their present attitude was damaging their cause.
