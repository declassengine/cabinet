The following paragraphs are taken from the Reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending 4th September and 11th September, and give a general survey of the situation for the respective weeks : The Labour Situation.  [4th September.] As far as industrial disputes are concerned the situation is becoming more serious. The Triple Alliance have given moral support to the miners&apos; demands. They have not, however, committed them-selves unconditionally to active support, hut at their meeting on the 1st September decided to authorize the sub-committee of the Alliance to remain in continuous session with power to add to their number. The Executive Council of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce have passed a resolution calling upon the Govern-ment to refuse entirely to entertain the miners&apos; demands, in view of the economic situation of the country. . The secretary cf the National Union of Manufacturers (Incorp.) has stated that a large number of firms intend to close down their works immediately on the declaration of a strike, in order to conserve their present stocks of coal.An interesting sidelight on the attitude of Labour towards the manufacture of war material, and the part which the National Council of Action are expected to play in any developments on the matter, is revealed by the resolutions passed at a meeting of officials of the Northamptonshire branches of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives. Inquiries had been made in view of the recent statements that boots were being manufactured in various parts of the country for Poland and other belligerent nations. The meeting passed a resolution recording the opinion that the army boots being made at certain factories were destined for the Polish Government, and asking the Union Executive Council to take immediate action in conjunction with the National Council of Action. A second resolution requested the National Council of Action to ask immediately for information as to the destination of the boots, and, in the event of this information not being forthcoming or satisfactory, asked the Council of Action to advise the Union Executive Council what line of action they should pursue.[11th September.] The principal event of the week has been the opening of the Trades Union Congress at Portsmouth on the 6th September. As compared with last year, when the Parliamentary Committee received a notable defeat, the proceedings have been quiet. Interest especially attaches to the discussion on the coal mines situation, which took place on the 8th. A resolution was adopted endorsing the miners&apos; claims, but offering no more than moral support. The attitude of the trade unions to the Unemployment Insurance Act was raised on the report of the Parliamentary Committee, but a decision Pas been postponed until the substantive resolutions on this subject are taken up.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.- Sweden and the British Protectorate. Mr. Ramsay telegraphed [No. 251] from Stockholm on 7th September as follows : Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General consider it would be incorrect to recognize our protectorate over Egypt before the ratification of the treaty agreeing thereto, and point out that no neutral Power has done so. They admit that recognition is a technicality and are prepared to discuss the proposed abolition of the consular courts in the meantime. They are awaiting a reply from the Swedish Minister in London before replying to our proposal.&apos; The Times pi 24th August arrived during the Inter-Scandinavian meeting of Ministers at Copenhagen, and the extent of the proposed concessions was read by them
-with astonishment.   The matter was discussed, and it is to be expected that the Scandinavian countries will adopt a common policy.   I gather that the Swedish - Government are making enquiries of other Powers with interests in Egypt.Return of the Delegates. Mr. Scott telegraphed [No. 878] from Alexandria on 7th September reporting that the four members of the Egyptian delegation had arrived at Alexandria that morning, and that they had been welcomed by a large number of friends and followers. Fairly large crowds were assembled in the streets when they drove to their hotel, and again in the afternoon when they were entertained to tea in the municipal gardens, and - considerable enthusiasm was shown. There were no symptoms of disorder. Mr. Scott added that he understood that the delegates were well satisfied with their reception in Alexandria, concerning which they had expressed apprehensions during the voyage.Manifesto by Four Princes. On 13th September Mr. Scott transmitted [No. 900] the following translation of a manifesto signed by Princes Omar Toussoun, Ismail Daoud, Said Daoud, and Mohammed Ibrahim, which had been published on the previous day in the Arabic newspapers : To our clear fellow countrymen.We issued our well-known message on 3rd January 1920, which was received with the highest approval by all classes of the nation. To-day we come at this critical period to make our opinion clear concerning the future of our country, which is to be decided, like other members of the nation to which we consider ourselves to belong, and whom we have the honour to serve.And this is: that our principles,, which we set forth in that message, are unchanged ; and that we do not cease to adhere to them with all our power, and that we do not see the way to conclude any agreement which is inconsistent with, or restricts (literally &quot; diminishes&apos;:) the independence of Egypt with her Sudan independence complete, real (? without) restrictive condition. This is our opinion upon this critical question. It is for the nation to give its noble opinion on the matter.   God guide us aright.Mr. Scott added that Princes Yusuf Kemal and Kamel-Ed-Din were abroad.PALESTINE.The Deraa-Semak Railway Section. Sir Herbert Samuel reported from Jerusalem [No. 236] on 2nd September that there had been a meeting between a French official and the Director of Railways that day at Haifa for the purpose of discussing- the handing over of this railway section. The French representative, however, declined to enter into any discussion when he found that Semak was not regarded by us as belonging to the section, he having been instructed to the contrary.Sir Herbert added that he wished to urge once again that for the proper working of the Palestine railway system the retention of the place in dispute was essential.INDIA.Situation on the Frontier [B.E.R., xxv, p. 6]. Telegraphing [No. 11531] on 1st September, the Viceroy reported that considerable effect had been produced in the cis-frontier district by the display of military force in support of the civil power, and that in consequence the internal situation was reported as much improved. The excitement had spread, however, to the trans-frontier Black Mountain tribes, who had attacked the military camp at Oghi on the night of 29th August, with considerable loss to themselves and none to us. Precautions were being taken to meet possible eventualities, but it was hoped by the civil authorities that the tribes would be brought to reason without resort to military operations across the border.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reporcs. The following reports were sent on 3rd September and 10th September : I. (3rd September). - The non-official Members of Council have issued a manifesto -emphatically disapproving the policy and principle of non-co-operation, and expressing
their deliberate conviction that the movement can do no good and is fraught with, harm to the best interests of the country. It would introduce elements of disorder, and the results would he fatal to the successful working of the Reforms Act, on which the future of the country largely depends. It was signed by the Raja of Mahmudabad, the Maharaja of Kasimbazar, Surendra Nath Banerjee, Sir Deva Prasad Sarvadhikarz, M. Srinavasca Sastri, Sunder Singh Majithia, Mir A sad Ali, R. D. Tata,. Col. Umar Hyat Khan, Khan Sahib Bhuttoo, Syed Mahomed Ali, ancl the following have since subscribed, to it: Sir Dinshaw Wacha, Sir Gangadhar Chitnavis, Sachidananda. Sinha ancl Abdur Rahim.In the provinces the non-co-operation movement is gaining nominal support but producing no appreciable results. The Central Provinces Congress Committee has passed a resolution in its favour. The special Congress meets this week and some members of the Legislative Council have gone to Calcutta for it, including Patel and Khaparde; some at least professedly to oppose the movement. An appeal was issued by Lajpat Rai to the moderates asking for unity and attendance at Calcutta, but few have made any response. Surendra Nath Banerjee issued a statement explaining the absolute uselessness of attending a congress packed with extremists.GandhPs tour in Madras was not successful; the most prominent of the-Nationalist leaders, though giving him an ovation on arrival, kept aloof from his meetings, deserting him, as one newspaper expressed it, like rats do a sinking ship. The Nationalists are now divided in Madras. Very few firm adherents to Gandhi ; others think the movement unconstitutional; others accept the principle but do not accept any programme so far put forward. Owing to the apparent failure of the-attempt to secure the practical support of lawyers, Gandhi has appealed to students. He also attacked the Viceroy, questioning, his sincerity over the Moslem question, and calling him a hypocrite.In the United Provinces an elaborate programme was accepted by the provincial committee, first stage, including (a) giving up titles and honorary distinctions ; (6) substitution of arbitration for recourse to Government courts; (c) promotion of national education by establishing national schools and colleges and gradually with-drawing students from Government institutions; (d) resignation from all honorary posts in public bodies other than those conferred by the people; (e) refusal to participate in any official or semi-official function or levee; (g) (sic) boycott of British goods. But the movement makes -but little progress in the United Provinces or the Punjab in spite of the activity bf the extremist leaders.The genuineness of the amir&apos;s proclamation regarding muhajarin was at first not believed in, and the extremist section of the vernacular Press continued to encourage the movement, but the return of the emigrants with stories of hardships undergone at last convinced even the most sceptical that the movement must for the present, at least, be abandoned. Anti-Government feeling in the Punjab is still very marked. The Local Government propose to prosecute ZafarAli of Zamindar for violent speeches delivered in the Attock district. In the North-West Frontier Province, except for the critical situation in Hazara, the amir&apos;s order has&apos; had a sobering effect in Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, ancl Hera Ismail Khan, with the result that the hijrat movement has become unpopular there. No sign of disorder anywhere except at Hazara. We have applied the Seditious Meetings Act to this district, and have-sanctioned the internment of two mullahs in British India. The last news from this district is more encouraging.In Bombay, prohibition was at first generally believed to be a device of the-British Government, but is now realized to be a fact. The chairman of the local hijrat committee claimed he had by reason of it dissuaded 200 prospective muhajarins from carrying out their intention of emigrating. Three Mohamedans were prosecuted in Bombay under section 103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, ancl convicted ; having refused to furnish security for good behaviour, they were sent to jail for one yeaPs rigorous imprisonment, unless security was furnished.Before the opening of the Council on 31st August, the Viceroy made a feeling reference to the assassination of Mr. Willoughby, Deputy Commissioner, Kheri, United Provinces. Surendra Nath Banerjee, voicing the opinion of the non-official members,, expressed deep sorrow and abhorrence at the dastardly outrage, sympathizing with the relatives of the deceased, and considered that the Government (? required) (? have not had) moral support in the maintenance of law ancl order. The murder Avas directly traceable to the Caliphate propaganda working on ignorant and fanatical minds, and loyal Mohamedans realize the danger of the movement spreading to the masses.   The leading assassin, who is a person with three or four previous convictions
for burglary arid one for assault on a Deputy Magistrate, and one accomplice have been arrested, but a secoud accomplice is not yet caught. There was general mourning in Kheri; all shops, schools, and other institutions were closed. Sir II. I3utler attended the funeral, at which large crowds were present, and afterwards addressed a general meeting of citizens called to express their abhorrence of the cowardly murder, a warning against itinerant agitation, and a call to loyal citizens to support the maintenance of law and order, and prevent agitation, kindling fanatical feeling and leading to very (? group omitted).  .Considerable interest was aroused by the announcement of the recommendations of the Commission on Egypt. In some quarters it is described as the first victory of Islam ; and in others, for example the Independent, of Allahabad, as a master stroke of policy certain to increase the menace to India&apos;s freedom and future, but while complicating the course of the evolution of national freedom in India likely to impart a new inspiration and strength to - the Nationalist movement, and call forth the determination of the people to win legitimate freedom without waiting upon the pleasure of British politicians, forcing their hands to do the same thing by India as by Egypt. jfcMuch indignation is expressed at the proposal to erect a slaughter house at Ratona, Central Provinces, in connexion with Davenport &amp; Co.&apos;s Central Provinces Tanning and Trading Company, brought in to replace the previous insanitary aud unscientific conditions by up-to-date methods. Meetings of protest have been held in Bombay, Calcutta, and elsewhere, and resolutions passed in the local council. The Chief Commissioner agreed to suspend the construction until a mixed committee of officials and non-officials had issued draft rules under the Slaughter of Animals Act.Jallianwala Bagh lias now been purchased for Its. 5,00,000 after the case had gone to court.&apos; An appeal has been issued to raise the balance from one to four lakhs for the erection of a memorial.II. (10th September.) The provincial reports show that attention is focussed on the Special Congress which met on the 4th. Prior to the meeting,, resolutions were adopted accepting non-co-operation in principle, but leaving details to the decision of the Congress. Press reports of the sessions show that 25,000 persons, including 5,000 delegates representing all the provinces, were present. Great, though not universal, enthusiasm was evinced. The Hunter Committee recommendations, the Turkish peace treaty and non-co-operation were the points for discussion. Prominent Moderate leaders were absent, but the rank and file were largely represented. The Chairman of the Reception Committee, Mr. B. Chakravarti, condemned the Hunter Committee Report, criticised tire House of Lords, the. attitude towards General Dyer, and claimed for India independence on the lines of Egypt, and emphasized that Hindus should stand by Moslems to the last in the Caliphate movement. President Lajpat Rai devoted the mam portion to Punjab events, concentrating on the attacks on Sir M. 0&apos;Dwyer ; urged that it was the duty of every Indian to press for his punish-ment and prosecution; that they owed it to themselves, their women and children, to seek for redress for the Amritsar atrocities ; pressed on the recall of the Viceroy, and unreserved moral and constitutional support to Moslems in the Caliphate agitation ; but gave no opinion or lead on non-co-operation, leaving it to the Congress. The opinion is held that Congress circles generally favour the principle of non-co-operation, but differ widely as to its practical application. A large body of leaders take the view that a boycott of Councils and professions is ill-advised. The &quot; Subjects Committee &quot; sat seven hours on the 5th discussing non-co-operation without coming to any definite decision.Press comments vary. The Civil and Military Gazette characterizes the presidents speech as indefinite and inaccurate. The Pioneer says that he rehashed old and stale diatribes against the Punjab with the object of exciting racial animosity and providing a stimulus to non-co-operation, already beginning to hang fire. The Leader considers the whole view of the position and prospect taken by the president more gloomy than is justified by facts. The Bengalee gives a warning that non-co-operation should not be discussed in a huff: Bengal, wise by experience, refuses to be caught by the glamour of a scheme destined to fail. The Tribune considers the address manly and outspoken, the outpouring of the Punjab&apos;s lacerated heart. The Bande-matram eulogizes the excellent handling of the Caliphate question. The Madras Mail criticizes the president for the want of clear directions as an impartial judge upon the expediency, advantage, or risk of non-co-operation. The Madras Times is surprised that no decided opinion for or against non-co-operation was indicated. The 20-3 B
(jHindu considers the address overwhelmingly judicial. The New India wants the president not to allow the Congress to be driven over to the non-co-operation principle by a feeling that the Caliphate and the Punjab have aroused the gospel of despair in any. Justice congratulates the president on making no definite pronouncement on non-co-operation.The Congress re-assembling on 8th September, Sir Ashutosh Chaudhuri moved its postponement with a view to gaining time to consider non-co-operation in all its details, but the motion was lost by a large majority, and after a whole day&apos;s sitting Gandhis programme was adopted by a majority. The debate was very exciting as well-known nationalist leaders were ranged against Gandhi. His programme includes renunciation of titles and honorary offices, boycott of foreign goods and the Legislative Councils, as well as the gradual withdrawal of children from schools, and lawyers from practice. The only weapon to be non-co-operation : non-violence should be their creed. Gandhi maintained that if the scheme were adopted, India would obtain complete responsible government in a year. Mrs. Besant strongly opposed it as impracticable, unwise, inexpedient and dangerous. B. C. Pal moved the exclusion of the boycott of Councils from the programme, and suggested the appointment of a Committee to examine the programme with a view to its eventual adoption. It may be noted, however, that in the article in the Democrat, Pal has denounced the non-co-operation in army and police as unconstitutional; Malaviya, C. R, Das, Jinnah and Baptista supported him. In the Congress Gandhbs motion was declared carried, but a division was demanded and a poll taken with the following result: total number of delegates registered 5,814, out. of whom 2,773 voted ; of these 1,826 voted for GandhTs proposal, and 88-1 for Pal&apos;s amendment. Gandhi had a majority in all the provinces except the Central Provinces and Berar.On 5th September a meeting of the All-India Moslem League was held under the presidency of Maulana (? groups omitted) a violent mullah from the United Provinces, who made a strong appeal to the audience to make every sacrifice for the Caliphate and to follow the dictates of Islam at this moment when soreness was going to be extinguished. Save for Mr. Willoughby&apos;s murder, Id passed oif without any violence or trouble anywhere. In some places there was a sacrifice of cows- on a smaller scale, but generally speaking no change in the attitude of the rank and file of Mohamedans towards cow sacrifice. Mr. Willoughby&apos;s murder aroused public indignation in the United. Provinces; also sympathetic references in the Press, both moderate and extremist, throughout India,1 save the Bombay Chronicle, in which a belated and lukewarm reference was made on 2nd September. In the United Provinces itself meetings were held to express indignation. Reports have been received that the extreme Pan-Islamists and Caliphate agitators do not conceal in private their delight at the murder, considering their work to have begun to bear fruit; at the same time they realize that in public they must condemn the murder, otherwise the work will suffer, and the Central Caliphate Committee have been asked from the United Provinces to do so.Yakub Beg has urged the Central Caliphate Committee, who promised to subscribe to the hijrat fund, to issue urgent circulars stopping hijrat, as the returning muhajarins, estimated at 10,000, complain of their pitiable condition. Their treatment is said to have excited an intensely bitter feeling against the Afghans and the promoters of the movement.   Nevertheless, the AU-Tnclia Hijrat Committee. passed a vote of thanks to the Amir for his reception of the muhajarins.Normal conditions have been re-established in the Hazara district. A deputation of Peshawar khans and&apos; maulvis visited Mansehra on 31st August. At a large meeting, general relief was expressed that the elements of disorder had been removed without violence. The sufferings of the muhajarins and the sympathetic efforts of the Government to assist were appreciated by the deputation. People are gladly returning to their usual occupations, and there is a growing atmosphere of confidence and goodwill. Tribesmen from the Black Mountain attacked the military at Oghi twice, but each time were repulsed.   The external situation is well in hand,: many tribal sections realizing the folly of the outbreak.In Delhi little attention is paid to non-co-operation, but an agitation is growing against the imposition of an indemnity paid for expenses arising out of the disturbance. Little money has been collected so far, and there are poor prospects of any large amount being got iu even by resort to distress warrants. The Chief Commissioner is giving the matter careful consideration, and will submit a full appreciation of the situation at the end of September.
Madras publishes a letter from one maulvi, Zahid Hussain, stating that he did not.surrender the title of Shamsul-Ulema of his own free will, but was forced- to do so by a threat that he would not be allowed burial in the Mohamedan burial ground. Similar letters have been received indicating the exercise of undue force to secure the renunciation of titles. The tone.of the Press everywhere continues to be violent; regret is expressed at Turkey&apos;s signature of the peace terms, and the view is frankly held, especially by the independents, that the independence of Egypt should lead to India&apos;s separation from the British Empire, the withdrawal of Egypt materially weakening India&apos;s position as a member of a Commonwealth of white nations. We have issued a circular to all the Local Governments explaining that, while our policy in regard to the non-co-operation movement remains unchanged, we hope that those guilty of incitement to violence will be prosecuted more vigorously than in the past. We are also instructing the Local Governments to collect material for the prosecution of the Executive Sub-Committee of the Caliphate movement in case such action becomes necessary.Overseas Garrisons and the Indian Army. The following telegram was sent by the Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India on 3rd September : Recent demands received by us for reinforcements for Mesopotamia on a large scale have forced us to consider the whole question regarding the supply of overseas garrisons from the Indian army.It would appear that His Majesty&apos;s Government is counting on India to provide a quota of the permanent garrisons of the mandatory territories in addition to certain colonial garrisons, including Aden, the Gulf ports and consular escorts in East Persia. We have received no direct intimation that His Majesty&apos;s Government desires us to undertake this liability; but have received an estimate which shows that, on the present figures, this force will include, among other details, four cavalry regiments, one cavalry troop, 10 Sappers and Miners companies, 39J Infantry and Pioneer battalions, one Signal troop and four Signal companies. It is possible this estimate is not final. We invite attention to the fact that we have not been consulted as to the probable political effect in India of accepting an engagement of this magnitude. It appears advisable to us, however, to warn you at once of our views on this aspect of the question.We have evidence to show that the great bulk of educated opinion in India is opposed to our undertaking extensive obligations in regard to overseas garrisons, and the subject has already attracted considerable attention in the Press and on the platform. The Turkish peace terms are universally unpopular, not only among Mohamedans, but among Hindus. Further, moderate opinion, including many Europeans, considers India is being exploited in being asked to provide, for service outside India, an unreasonably large proportion of the troops now employed for imperial purposes, since it is clear that no similar demand has been made on the Dominions, and that all British troops were demobilized as quickly as possible, with the inevitable result that, in case of trouble, the increased demands must be met from India and not from home.Attention is drawn to the fact that India is an original member of the League of Nations ; but it is Great Britain and not India which has received a mandate for the new territories, and the troops employed are largely Indian. The general feeling above referred to naturally reinforces the movement among advanced Mohamedans on grounds peculiar to themselves against the despatch of troops to Mesopotamia and Palestine, while it is of course seized upon by extremist agitators, who are glad of any opportunity to embarrass us. We apprehend that this will react seriously on the general political situation, and affect the moral of the army, and we do not think it will be possible to maintain the position that India is to provide troops from the Indian army for this purpose for any length of time. Again, it is difficult to convince India at large that charges for such troops are not borne by Indian revenues, and this adds to our difficulties in gaining acceptance for the greatly increased charges for military expenditure which forms part of our recent budget arrangements. Nor, indeed, are we ourselves able to contest the argument that the obligation for maintaining overseas troops leads to considerable additional expenditure, since, apart from temporary difficulties as to demobilization caused, by the knowledge that additional demands may be made on us at any moment, it is obvious not only that there are many items which we cannot definitely allocate, such as increased staff and inspection of (corrupt group) and accommodation, but the knowledge that a considerable portion of the Indian army may be called upon to spend long periods on overseas service will affect the general rates of pay at winch we can recruit the Indian army. 20-3 C
We do not wish, to represent that we have so far encountered any difficulty as regards reinforcements recently despatched to Mesopotamia ; though we are aware that many regiments which have been serving overseas are feeling the strain due to lack of furlough, and the dangers of political and religious influence affecting the army are considerable. Our main apprehensions are, however, for the future, and we look with grave concern on what we. hold to be the inevitable consequences, political and otherwise, (corrupt group) which will commit ourselves to supply overseas garrisons, for a prolonged.period.It must be realized that there are certain&apos; inherited traditions connected with peace service in the Indian army which have become to be regarded as a right; such as the grant of liberal leave and furlough for harvesting, for the purposes of marriage, or for other domestic reasons. Such considerations are incomparable with prolonged service overseas.Again, although the&apos;men themselves may raise no objection to overseas service, the women-folk are put to great inconvenience and frequently to hardship, through the absence of their men-kind, and consequently grow discontented, a state of things of which the agitator is not slow to take advantage, but one which we are practically powerless to remedy, and we trust you will impress on the Cabinet Council the importance of recognizing these factors.In our special Despatch No. 2, we stated definitely that the Government of India could not accept an obligation to supply permanent overseas garrisons to mandatory territories, and we now desire definitely to emphasize that position, and ask that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take our views on the subject, into consideration. His ; Majesty&apos;s Government can rely on our doing our best to endeavour to enlist men in India on their behalf for local forces maintained in Mesopotamia or elsewhere, but we do not consider that, the Indian army should be required to provide large overseas forces, ancl we shall be glad to receive some definite statement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter.In the present condition of affairs, particularly in Mesopotamia, we shall, of course, make every effort to do our best to meet emergent demands for reinforcements as they arise, though we recognize the danger of this course, but we look to His Majesty&apos;s Government to return Indian units to us as speedily as the situation permits. As regards the reinforcements now being sent, we propose, with your concurrence, to make a public announcement that, owing to the spread of serious disorder in Mesopo-tamia, the Government have been compelled to declare that a state of war exists in that area, and intends to use all resources at its disposal to put an end to this state, and,to protect British and Indian subjects on service in the&quot; country. This will constitute service in Mesopotamia as active, and give us the requisite power to deal with any inconvenient incidents which may arise.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Mistellaneous.-The following items of information have been reported from the Department of External Affairs : 1, Harvesting in Western Canada is progressing splendidly. Saskatchewan reports state that wheat cutting is nearly all completed, and that the yield secured exceeds early predictions. There has been hardly any damage to the crops from frost.2, The value of Canada&apos;s total external trade for the twelve months ended 31st July was $2,517,000,000.3. The Imperial Oil Company^ prospectors have struck oil in the Mackenzie river region on the edge of the Arctic Circle.4. Business conditions are excellent throughout Canada. Bank clearings for the Dominion during the week ended 26th August were 28 per cent, in excess of those for the corresponding week last year. Big crops will bring about heavy fall and winter business.5. The Hon. C. C. Ballantyne, M.P., Minister.of Marine and Fisheries, announces that the Dominion Government is prepared to make Vancouver one of the best ports on the Pacific coast.
6. Thirty-eight vessels have now been delivered to the Dominion authorities out of the fleet ordered for the Canadian Government Merchant Marine.7. Gold production in Northern Ontario during the first six months of this year amounted to $11,200,000.8. Harvesting operations continue throughout the West, the yields being larger than at first reported.NEW ZEALAND. , , .Freight Rates. On 8th September the Officer Administering the&apos; Government telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, saying that the Government of New Zealand viewed with grave concern the recent advance in the rates of freight for produce authorized to be charged on overseas liners, and would be glad of the fullest information as to the facts put forward by the shipping companies in support of their claims for the increased charges. As a Parliamentary Committee was sitting to consider shipping questions, the Prime Minister would be pleased to receive all avail-able information at the earliest possible date.Imperial Wireless Committee.   The following telegram from the Officer Administering the Government was received on 10th September: - Firstly, the New Zealand Government concurs in the general principles of the scheme outlined in the report. Secondly, the existing New Zealand and Australian wireless stations referred to in the Report (page 9) are designed largely to meet strategic emergencies - and are not adequately equipped for inter-colonial commercial work or tb compete with the submarine cable services operating between New Zealand and Australia even though such competition were desirable or necessary. Thirdly, from the Report it apparently follows that unless a New Zealand and an Australian station, say Awarua and Pennant Hills, be modernized, as valve stations of the class proposed for the Imperial chain, and be devoted by mutual consent to the conduct of inter-colonial wireless traffic, there is no indication that New Zealand has been considered as a possible link in the proposed chain. Even though the proposed scheme be modified to include New Zealand in this way, New Zealand would be the last link in the chain ; and traffic between New Zealand and European centres would, as a natural consequence, be subject to a maximum delay, and this it is feared to such an extent as to render the service unsatisfactory and unreliable from New Zealand&apos;s point of. view. Fourthly, apart from the foregoing it is not apparent from the Report that the proposed inclusion of New Zealand as a link in the Imperial chain of wireless communication is considered practicable or probable. Fifthly, it is suggested as a practical alternative that when sufficient experience of the working of the proposed valve stations has been obtained, the possibilities of a wireless route from New Zealand to Canada and the United Kingdom via Awanui ^New Zealand), Apia (Samoa), and Honolulu might well receive consideration as affording a more direct route and a greater probability of a satisfactory commercial service. The Awanui and Apia stations would, under such a scheme, require modernizing as already indicated For strategic purposes in time of war the existing wireless service between New Zealand and Australia would still remain.SOUTH AFRICA.Departure of Lord and Lady Buxton. Reuters Capetown agent telegraphed on 3rd September saying that the departure of Lord and Lady Buxton on that clay had been heralded by strikingly general and sincere appreciations of the services of their Excellencies to South Africa. The &quot;very real and personal feeling of regret&quot; in saying farewell had been voiced in leading articles throughout the country. After the departure of Lord Buxton, the Chief Justice, Sir James Rose-Innes, K.O.M.G., was. sworn in as Acting Governor-General, and Brigadier-General Carter as Acting High Commissioner until the arrival of Prince Arthur of Connaught.Lord Buxton&apos;s Farewell Address. ReutePs agent telegraphed as follows from Capetown on 23rd August: Lord Buxton was entertained at a farewell civic banquet in the City Hall to-ciay by the leading naval and military authorities, prominent civilians, and members of Parliament. His Excellency, wdio received a tremendous reception, thanked the citizens for the confidence shown him and said it was physically impossible for him to
continue his work longer : be bad been continuously in harness since December 1005.. But he left South Africa with the utmost regret, and it was a satisfaction to know that lie would be followed by a successor who would throw lustre on the position of Governor-General and High Commissioner. He expressed particular satisfaction that almost his last official action had been to sign the Native Affairs Act, which, he pointed out, marked a distinct advance in the attitude of Europeans towards the natives and in the position of the natives themselves. It showed confidence in them, gave them some voice in the management of. their own affairs, and brought them into touch and consultation in regard to questions affecting them.His Excellency declared that the people of the United Kingdom entertained the-warmest and friendliest sentiments towards the people of the Dominions. They felt that the ties binding them together had been greatly strengthened by the common defence of civilization and humanity in the war, and they were grateful to the Dominions for the prompt and generous way they had come to their assistance at a. time of emergency. They entertained the most ardent desire for a prosperous future-for every Dominion, and not least for the Union of South Africa.South African Banking Amalgamation,.-Th.&amp; following report was sent by Reuter&apos;s agent from Capetown on 1st September : -Commercial circles are highly critical of the amalgamation of the Standard Bank of South Africa and the African Banking Corporation. Mr. J. W. J agger, member of the Legislative Assembly, speaking at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, stated emphatically that no one would say the amalgamation was for the benefit of South. Africa. There was no question of cheaper working, he continued, and the sole object was to do away with certain competition. Here was trade involving over one hundred million pounds and monthly clearings amounting to over thirty millions now really in the hands of two banks (i.e., the Standard Bank of South Africa and the National Bank of South Africa).
