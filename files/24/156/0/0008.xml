GENERAL.[These two paragraphs are taken from the Report on the Labour Situation issued by the Ministry of Labour for the fortnight ending 31st December 1919.]Ireland, Egypt and India. Recent events in Ireland and Egypt, together with the reports of the evidence heard by Lord Hunter&apos;s enquiry into the Punjab riots arouse voluminous discussion. The general opinion is that these events have openly exposed the barbarity of Imperialism. The New Statesman argues that the British public cannot escape its responsibility in the matter of Amritsar by denouncing General Dyer as a criminal. The essential and governing fact is that the British administration in India is attempting to rule a number of nations against their will. Recourse to force is a necessary corollary of our failure to introduce democratic insti-tutions concurrently with the spread of democratic ideas. The Labour Leader and the Bradford Pioneer strongly emphasize the usual Independent Labour Party moral that the British people are themselves responsible in so far as they permit the men who pursue a criminal policy to remain in power; and Messrs. Ramsay Macdonald and William Stewart in Forward reason in the same strain, that the only solution is for the people to change their government and to change their own spirit by voting Independent Labour Party. The Call, on the other hand, calls upon the workers to repudiate all responsibility for Imperial policy, which&quot; represses their own freedom as much as that of subject races and believes that British capitalism itself is in too precarious a condition to endure the &quot; White man&apos;s burden.&quot; The Workers&apos; Dread-nought welcomes the report that an Indian Bolshevik Commission has reached Samara to enter into relations with Soviet Russia, and suggests that western capitalist militarism is the one obstacle to the spread of Soviet government in the East.The General Labour Situation. The general situation in the past two weeks, as is usual at this time of the year, has been on the whole uneventful. Labour propa-ganda has been interrupted by the holiday season, and though a few meetings have been held in connexion with the campaign for the nationalization of the mines, and with regard to the new scheme of railway control, nothing of note has been either said or done. A number of disputes have occurred, but these have been sectional in extent and minor in importance. As a result of the good offices of the Ministry of Labour and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, there is hope that the ironmoulders&apos; strike may be settled at an early date. The growing tendency, to which attention has previously been drawn in this Report, to negotiate rather than strike on important national matters, has received further confirmation in the decision of both parties to refer the national demands of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a 16s. per day minimum wage for dockers and waterside workers to a Court of Enquiry. Several demonstrations of unemployed, in various provincial towns have taken place, and there is evidence of increasing discontent among -ex-Service men, chiefly on the-ground of unemployment and the high cost of living.CROWN COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.SUDAN.The Wadai-Darfour Convention.  On 22nd December Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 1370] to Lord Allenby for information on the following point: -The French Ambassador states that the Sudanese Government have occupied Massalit before the ratification of the Waclai-Darfour Convention of 8th September. Please ascertain if this is the case.The Convention contains no&apos; provision for the exchange of ratifications, and presumably is already effective. This point is being taken up with the Ambassador, but in the meantime further advance had better be postponed.Lord Allenby sent [No. 1767] the following reply on 29th December:-No advance has been made into Massalit, although the Sultan has urgently requested that we should occupy it, which he has been informed we cannot do at present.   The only
(?. incident) which could have given colour to the French statement is that the British officer at Kereinik, which has been occupied for the last two years, went to die French post at Adre with 15 rank and file, to return, the visit paid him by the French Commandant Wurmser and, on his return, did not proceed (? via) the route taken in going, but made a detour northwards. On the other hand, the French have occupied part of the country claimed by Taaislia (? and have) (? hoisted) (? their) flag at Umdefog, presumably on the ground that it lies south of the eleventh parallel and west of the Nile (?) Share watershed, there being no Nile-Congo watershed north of the Bahr-el-Gazal Province boundary. As it is impossible to say whether this country will fall to the French or to us, until the frontier is delimited, 1 suggest that the French be asked not to occupy any country not already in their occupation until the boundary is settled. As my Despatch No. 68 of 4th December clearly shows, the Sudan Government has no intention of taking any action with regard to the Convention, until authorized to (-? do so).ADEN.The Imam. The Resident at Aden reported to Cairo on .1.9th, 22nd, 29th and 31st December [A.P. 276, 277, 279, and 281, repeated to -Foreign Office unnumbered] as follows : The Imam&apos;s Zaidi troops were steadily absorbing more territory inside our border, and so threatening the flank of our advance on Dhala. Some of our tribes were showing resistance and were being helped with ammunition; they expected, however, the fulfilment of our treaty promises, and in particular asked to be protected by troops. The Resident said that in a few days&apos; time he should move 300 men to Nobat Dakim to induce confidence and to act as a backing to the tribes, but the situation could not be restored until a column moved into the hills.A telegram had been received from Major Meek, urging the necessity of an early settlement of our policy in Tehama, and advocating the claims of the Idrisi ; the Resident quite agreed, but understood that nothing could be done until after the settlement of the peace terms with Turkey. He thought that the Imam hoped that when the settlement came possession would be regarded as a right.The Resident said that he had received letters from the Imam, who in one of them, couched in a friendly tone, repeated that Dhala continued to be occupied by his troops in virtue of his orders. He expressed a wish for a general discussion of affairs, and suggested that Colonel Jacob should pay him a visit, to which the Resident had replied that such a discussion could only take place after a complete evacuation of the Protectorate. .MESOPOTAMIA.Deir-ez-Zor. On l!)th December [No. 1318] Lord Curzon instructed Lord Derby to inform Emir Feisal without delay that the Deir-ez-Zor incident was regarded with the utmost seriousness, and to call upon him to issue immediate orders for the with-drawal of his forces. Otherwise His Majesty&apos;s Government could not be responsible, for the consequences, which might be very grave.INDIA.Telegraphing on the 19th December, the Viceroy reported as follows :   The Congress. The movement of the Moderates to hold a separate Congress is gaining strength. The invitation of Swami Snadanaud, the Chairman of the Reception Committee, to the Moderates to participate in the Amritsar Congress has not met with a favourable response.Re forms.  Public opinion is generally favourable and the Moderate papers are urging the necessity of co-operation, but the extremist organs are now definitely hostile.The Hunter Committee. The enquiry into the disturbances at Gujranwala has been completed. The Press has commented bitterly on the use of aeroplanes, but, except in the extremist organs, interest in the proceedings is flagging.
:&quot;.:,:Peace Gelebrations.-In spite of great efforts on the part of the;Publicity. Board, established by extreme opponents of celebration, and messages from-eminent extremists, the celebrations,passed off successfully as far as present information goes,; all through we relied on ,the .gpod,.seiise of, ,$ie -Moderates,official interference, with extremist opposition being everywhere carefully avoided.East Indian Railway Strike.&apos; -Employees of the East Indian Railway Company,, numbering 20,000, have been on strike, but there have been no untoward incidents.Rouble Notes. An Ordinance making the possession of rouble notes illegal, except for a period of grace of six weeks from the date of the Ordinance to protect innocent holders, has been promulgated. It has met with opposition from the Bombay Indian Chamber of Commerce and is criticized in Peshawar, but elsewhere it has not attracted, attention. . The object of the Ordinance is to check Bolshevik propaganda,-and this has been explained to the public.The Afghan desire for a Gonsul-General in Peshawar. [B.E.R. vi., 4]. On 24th December the Viceroy reported [No. 1752 S.] -that a reply to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s letter had been received from Mahmud Tarzi. In this he pointed out that the old custom was to appoint Afghan agents without the preliminary sanction of the Home Government, though he admitted the correctness of the statement that its prior sanction was necessary for the creation of consular posts. He agreed, too, that the matter must be postponed until after the discussion of the friendship treaty, at the same time, emphasizing the need of some Afghan agent at Peshawar, whence all necessaries of life from abroad went to Cabul.i Economic Conditions. Referring to his telegram dated 12th December (B.K.R. vii., page 4), the Viceroy reported on 19th December that relief works in the Thatoii district of Burma had been practically stopped, and that famiue operations in the Hutta Birioi and Palur estates of the Gap jam district in Madras Presidency had been closed.Numbers relieved : Burma : works, 2,700 ; gratuitous, 100. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 1,216; gratuitous, not reported. Hyderabad: works, 8,000; gratuitous, 3,000.   Madras&apos;: works, 297 ; gratuitous, 2,212.In a later telegram, dated 2nd Jannary, the Viceroy further reported that, in Hyderabad the situation was not yet satisfactory, although, famine distress was confined to a few Talukas only.Numbers relieved :-Bu.rma: works, 2;&apos;700 ; gratuitous, not reported. Hydera--bad: works, 7,000 j. gratuitous, 2,000. Madras: works, not reported; gratuitous, incomplete figures, 48.- In continuation of these reports, the Viceroy telegraphed on 26th December that there was marked abatement in the distress in Hyderabad where Takavi advances had been stopped.Numbers relieved: -Burma: works, 2,700; gratuitous, 100. Feudatory States of Orissa: report not received. . Hyderabad : works, 7,000; gratuitous, 3,000. -Madras : works, 197 ; gratuitous, 174.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.The Admiralty Offer of Warships-Oii the 23rd December, the Governor-General telegraphed as follows : Admiral Jellicoe has given my advisers to understand that the Admiralty are prepared to offer a number of various classes of warships to the Dominions as a &quot;gift. He states that application for vessels, which include a light cruiser of the &quot; Bristol&quot; type, a-flotilla leader, four &quot;M&quot; class destroyers, eight &quot; P.C.&quot; or &quot;P.&quot; boats,: and six &quot;0 &quot; class, submarines, must be -made before 31st. January 1920. -Is it possible-for the Admiralty to extend the date of application for these vessels until 15th March, as the-Canadian Parliament does not meet until 20th February and the approval of Parliament would be required for acquisition of the vessels named ?
Sir Robert Borden.- -[13. ICR. vii.,4.1. On 18th December the Director of Informa-&quot; tion reported that Sir Robert Borden would retain the Premiership of the Dominion and early in January would leave on a long holiday so that, relieved from the cares of office, he might recover bis health.   The political situation, which had; been iunch disturbed by the report of his retirement, had settled down.Revenue and Exchange. On 18th December the Director of Information reported that the revenue of the Dominion for. November was 131,600,000, which was $2,000,000 ahead of that for November 1918; and that:the total,Federal revenue to date for this year was $25,000,000 in excess of the amount received during the same period,of last year. Much comment and concern, however, was caused by the rate of exchange with the United States, which was 10 per cent, against the Dominion. In the previous week $20,000,000 in gold had been forwarded to the United States from Ottawa.AUSTRALIA.-Wool. On 30th December the Secretary of State for the..Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia the following message : The selling price of Australian wool has had the earnest attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is fully understood that the Commonwealth Government is entitled to half the profits realized on all wool taken over by His Majesty&apos;s Government under three successive contracts. It is also understood that it was part of the last contract, concluded June 1918, that the Bradford issue prices for civilian wool should be revised from time to time, in consultation with the Commonwealth Government. Frequent and full consultation regarding the method of disposing of Australian wool, has been carried on between the Director of Raw Materials, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the Central Wool Committee, appointed by the Commonwealth Government to administer the wool purchase account. Thus, it was agreed in March last that from 1st April until 30th November Australian wool should be disposed of for civilian purposes by a dual system of issues at Bradford issue prices, and through auction sales carried on simultaneously. The quantity since issued to British manufacturers, at the issue prices agreed upon with the Central Wool Committee, is about 450,000 bales. Wool sold by auction to the highest bidder is about 1,400,000 bales. Sales to Allied Governments at issue prices are about 250,000 bales. All issues of wool at fixed prices totally ceased 30th November, with the possible exception of a supply to the devastated provinces of France, discussed with the Commonwealth authorities by the special French Mission 12 months ago, the full position as to which is detailed in a letter to the Central Wool Committee dated 28th October. His Majesty&apos;s Government have every intention of complying with the spirit and the letter of the contract with the Commonwealth Government, which will work out very profitably for the sheep farmers, who will get their agreed share of the fullest auction value of practically the whole of the .1918-19 and 1919-20 clips. It is true that the issue prices fixed for the period between April and November have turned out considerably below the market value, but the difiiculty of appreciating the conditions beforehand is shown by the fact that two months after the revised issue prices were fixed with the consent of the Central Wool Committee the Common-wealth Government protested against the cancelment of the contract for wool with the United States, dated November 1918, at Bradford issue prices. The Commonwealth Government considered the cancelment disadvantageous, but on the contrary, owing to the unexpected rise in world values the United States merchants are now paying in some cases nearly double the price for wool thus released.The Admiralty Offer of Warships. On 25th December the Secretary of State for the Colonies received the following message, transmitted by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia : With reference to your telegram of 28th November, regarding the offer of surplus warships, the Commonwealth Government hopes to be able to communicate its decision early in the New Year.NEW ZEALAND.The Admiralty Offer of Warships.-0n 26th December the Governor-General of New Zealand telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,as follows : My Government, following the advice of Lord Jellicoe, wish to acquire eight, &quot; P.G.&quot; class torpedo craft, and six &quot; E &quot; class submarines from the Admiralty, of a date 7-2 B
later than 191.4. It is requested, as. New Zealand is not yet ready to take over these vessels, lhat. they may be retained at aiiy of .the IJonie dockyards or potts, with a maintenance: and;-carb-party of sufficient ratings and ranks to keep them in a state of efficiency until required; the-cost of their upkeep, wages of crew, being borne by the.Government of New Zealand; It is;understood that H.M.S. Chatham has;.been earmarked for New Zealand;&apos;and&apos;it is requested, if this is So, that a&apos;suitable date be suggested from which the vessel, should be taken over. The above is in reply to your telegram of 5th December, and, is based on the assumption that the vessels are intended as gifts to the Government of.New Zealand.In connection., with the foregoing the Governor-General telegraphed -on 29th December the following message : Please take no action, pending further consideration by my Government of your telegram of 1st December, with reference to H.M.S. Chatham. At their first meeting in the New Year the Cabinet expects to arrive at a definite decision in the matter.Liquor Laws. Telegraphing on 6th January the Governor-General reported that with regard to the elections, although the returns were not yet quite complete, it was now practically certain that prohibition would be defeated by a small majority, and that the present licensing system would remain unchanged.SOUTH AFRICA.Congress of the South African Party : Important Speeches by General Smuts.  ReuteFs agent reported from Bloemfontein, on 11th December, as follows : Addressing the Congress of the South African Party of the whole Union which was opened here to-day, General Smuts made an important speech. At the outset the South African Prime Minister affirmed that there were three reasons for his objecting to the Nationalist secession movement, namely: (I) General HertzogS treatment of the Constitution as a &quot; scrap of paper &quot; was bound to inflame the new population against the old ; (2) It was not for the Nationalists to break the grand pact upon which theConstitution rested;(3) The Nationalist movement was unnecessary, inasmuch as those conducting it were fighting against the British Empire which ceased to exist on 4th August 1914, and the South,Africans were now masters of their own fate, both internally and externally, in war time and in peace time.Proceeding to explain his programme, General Smuts announced the development of the Governments native policy, including the establishment of a permanent Council to advise the Prime Minister on native affairs. He declared himself in favour of the retention of the Provincial Council system which, taken all. in all, had been successful. He foreshadowed vast irrigation works, the electrification of the railways and great industrial development, and/reaffirmed that the South African Party would go to the elections standing on their own legs, for they could not join the Nationalists.The Unionist PartyS conditions for amalgamation were, he added, unacceptable, while between the South African and the Labour Parties there was a wide difference of principle. .General Smuts, in conclusion, appealed to all Moderates to support him. The times were critical, he declared, and he therefore appealed to the country on the strength of his own and the Governments record.Referring to the cost of living, General Smuts said that the Government were tackling the question, in all earnestness. Dealing with the influence of the currency question On. the cost of living, he declared that their position was most healthy. The paper circulation of 7,000,000/. was safeguarded by a reserve of 6,000,000/. in gold and approximately 1,000,000/. in silver.As regarded the Asiatic question, General Smuts declared, that a fresh invasion had been stopped, but a new danger had arisen especially in connexion with trade, and steps would have to be taken, but he deprecated any ill-considered action which might easily lead to worse difficulties. They should await tlie investigations of the Committee shortly, to be appointed in accordance with the promise of the Acting-Premier to the Anti-Asiatic League.General Smuts foreshadowed a general election in April or May next year.
.&apos; Telegraphing again on .12th December, ReuteFs agent reported as follows.;-.... At yesterdays closiiigsession, ol the . South African. Party, Conference, General -Smuts, speaking of the chances.of the South African Party at the forthcoming elections, said,he anticipated an.inipi-oyement in their, position in the Transvaal,,no change in the Free State and perhaps ah improvement in Natal, -while;-tie.regards the Gape.he thought it might prove to lie tile main battlefield. He hoped, however, that the people of the Cape would be true to their traditions of order and good government, and remember the lessons of the, great dan Hofmeyr. General Smuts mentioned, inter alia, that the new colour of the uniform of the South African Defence Force would not be khaki but one which would command the support of all sections of the community.Resolutions of the Congress. Renter&apos;s agent reported oil 12th December that the Congress of the South African. Party had that day adopted two important resolutions. The first resolution, which was carried by 76 votes to 56, was in. favour of woman suffrage, and the second, which was passed almost unanimously, was ill favour of election to the Senate by popular vote.Speech by Sir Thomas Smartt. ReuteFs agent telegraphed from Capetown on 22nd December as follows :  Speaking to-night at a most representative meeting of leading Unionists in Capetown, Sir Thomas Smartt delivered what he described as a trumpet-call to Unionists on the eve of the general election.Mr. Jagger, who presided, predicted that the election would be held in March or April. The proceedings were marked by much enthusiasm. Sir Thomas Smartt detailed the main points of the Unionist programme; and said now was the time for the Unionist Party to carry on as an opposition untrammelled in any way. Although he had believed in the advisability of amalgamation so as to give a fresh start to South Africa, he affirmed amid loud applause that no catch-vote in Parliament could ever sever the connexion between Great Britain and the Union. Sir Thomas made a fervent appeal to South Africa to take a fair share in the upkeep of the British Navy which.had protected the wdiole world.The Opposition IcadeFs speech was mainly devoted to domestic matters the Party&apos;s policy on the cost of living, the control of rents and housing accommodation.&apos; Regarding the last, he advocated a Government loan and urged the Government to do everything for the contentment of the people. In an eloquent peroration he asserted the absolute necessity of securing good settlers. Replying to criticisms of Lord Milner&apos;s scheme, he said that Lord MiluePs settlers started in drought. It was true that a few failed, but the others had revolutionized agricultural development in the Free State. The more they could place, on the land the better. Sir Thomas strongly claimed that the Union was the real democratic party in which the real working man should sit. .&apos;South African Labour Disputes. ReutePs agent reported from Capetown on 28th December that the dock strike, which began on the 17 th instant, as a protest against the exportation, of foodstuffs from South Africa, and which threatened at one time to develop into a general strike, had been called off by the Strike Committee on the ground of lack of support from the Railwaymen&apos;s Union and the Federation of Trades.In regard to this strike, Lord Buxton, telegraphing on 29th December, said, that at first the situation looked ugly, but the arrangements which had been made for dealing with the matter had proved satisfactory.South Africa to import Wheat Flour in its own Ships.- ReutePs agent telegraphed from Pretoria on 11th December as follows : The Union Government, as a result of representations, has decided in the event of freight space being unobtainable for the importation of wheat flour from Australia during the present shortage in South Africa, to use its own ships as far as is practicable on condition that the saving of freight thus effected is applied for the benefit of the public by the reduction of the price of commodities. The Government is also substantially reducing for the time being railway rates for imported wheat flour.Aerial Communications. The Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on. 5th January, that General Smuts was willing to grant a prize for immediate competition for a flight from London or Cairo to the Cape, but
wished to ascertain General Sykes&apos; view as to what would be a fair amount to-offer for a prize. South Africa was more interested in the Cairo to the Cape part of the flight.Indian Properly Oimership. On 6th January the Secretary of State for&apos; the-Colonies telegraphed the following message to the Governor-General of the Union of South. Africa: The Government of India has received a telegram from the Transvaal British Indian Association protesting against (1) the judgment of the magistrate, under Transvaal Ordinance 9 of 1912, sections 90 and 91, upholding the contention of the Municipality as to the undesirability of Indians, and (2) the judgment of the Provincial Court in the case of the Krugersdorp Municipality v. Naidoo, declaring the acquisition of land by Indian companies illegal. 1 If it is correct that rights, acquired by Indian controlled companies in the Transvaal, even before 1st May last,, have now been held to be illegal, the Indian Government hope that no further action adverse to Indian interests will be taken, at any rate until the report of the Com-mission to inquire into the holding of property and trading licences by Asiatics has been received. The Secretary of State for India associates himself with this hope, and represents the necessity of finding some means of protecting rights to property ownership acquired before 1st May .1919, by Indians, as companies acting in good faith, and as he understands, on the strength of rulings previously given by the Courts, to the effect that the provision of Law 3 of 1885, did not prohibit such ownership.NEWFOUNDLAND.Export of Iron Ore. On 3rd January the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor of Newfoundland, with reference to his confidential Despatch of 27th September 1918, as follows :  It appears from Press announcements that an increase of export duty on iron ore from Bell Island mines is contemplated by the Government of Newfoundland. In this connexion, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been considering suggesting to the Government of Newfoundland that it might be possible in view of the expiration of the agreements contained in Newfoundland Statutes, 10 Edward VII., Chapters 2(5 and 27, to discourage the diversion of this ore from Empire industries, by imposition of a differential duty on the export of this ore, if sent outside the Empire for smelting, either by lowering the duty on the exports to British destinations, or by raising the duty on the exports to foreign countries, or both. In the Federated Malay States and Nigeria, duty of this kind has been imposed on the exports of tin ore, and in West Africa on palm kernels. 1 should be glad of the views of your JVIinisters on the suggestion given above.
