The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 19th May 1920 : High Prices. Some discontent and unrest continue in consequence of the continued increase in the cost of living. Much attention has been paid to the retail prices index number, which at the 1st May showed an increase of 141 per cent, over pre-war standard. The Labour Party Executive and the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. will both take the question of high prices into consideration at their meetings on Wednesday and Thursday, the 19th ancl 20th instant. The- City of London branch of the I.L.P. is calling a. special emergency conference, defegates of trade councils, trade union branches, labour parties, socialist parties, co-operative committees, ex-Service men&apos;s organizations, &amp;c; to consider the Socialist remedy for high prices.International Association for Labour Legislation (British Section). The position of this body, in view of the inception of the International Labour Office, clearly required reconsideration, and a meeting for the purpose was held on Monday, the 17th instant, of the British Section of this Association. It was determined to re-organize the British Section and to send delegates to a meeting of the International Association which is to be held at Basle on the 7th July with instructions to support the reorganization of the International Association and the sale of the library at Basle to the International Labour Office. The amalgamation of the international Associa-tion on Labour Legislation with the International Association on Unemployment was also approved in principle. It was agreed that while the establishment of the International Labour Office under the Treaties of Peace has rendered the old work of the Association no longer necessary, there is still much work for the Association to do, for example, promoting the ratification of Conventions adopted by International Labour Conferences, by means of parliamentary and other methods, and the watching of the progress of legislation connected with those Conventions.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.New Ministry.-On 19th May Lord Allenby reported [No. 490] that Yusuf Wahba Pasha had that clay tendered his resignation of the office of Prime Minister on the ground of ill-health, and that his resignation had been accepted. Two clays later he further reported [No. 499] that all the members of the Wahba Ministry, with the exception of Yehya Ibrahim, had accepted office ; and on the 22nd May he gave [No. 500] a list of the new Ministers : Tewfik Nessim Pasha, Prime Minister ancl Minister of the Interior.Ahmed Ziwar Pasha, Minister of Communications.Ahmed Zuliikar Pasha, Minister of Justice.Mohammed Shafik Pasha, Minister of Public Works, War, and Marine. Hussein Darwish Pasha, Minister of Wakfs. Tewfik Rifaat Pasha, Minister of Education. Mahmud Fakhry Pasha, Minister of Finance. Yusuf Suleiman Bey, Minister of Agriculture.SUDAN.The Aliab Dinka Rising [B.E.R., vii., p. 2].-On 18th May Lord Allenby transmitted [No. 483] the following telegram received from Khartoum, dated 14th May :--I have much pleasure in reporting that the force under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Darwall, Royal Marines, detailed to carry out punitive measures, brought its operations to a successful conclusion on 4th May, by the complete surprise of the enemy&apos;s main force, who offered no resistance.   The principal chief implicated
surrendered unconditionally on. 6th May. The force has been iivthe field for just two months, during which period the country has been thoroughly patrolled and large -captures of stock made ; with the exception of a few skirmishes and night attacks, no serious opposition has been encountered. I will forward your Excellency in due -course a despatch giving details of the whole operations.PALESTINE.General Conditions. Telegraphing on 21st May [No. 502] Lord Allenby said that he had paid a three days&apos; visit to Palestine, had been warmly welcomed, and had found the country quiet. The harvest, he said, was in progress, and the crops were good.ADEN.. ^ The Quhra Sheikhs [B.E.R., v., p. 4,-and vii., p. 2].-The Resident, telegraphing [No. 326 A.P.] ou 19th May, reported that the Quhra Sheikhs were rapidly forgetting the agreement made with them by Colonel Jacob, and appeared to regard it as no longer binding. Any assurances that Colonel Meek had given them of protection against the Idrisi and the Imam had been discounted by the Quhra having voluntarily submitted to j the Idrisi. The Resident recommended that the question should not be further raised.WESTERN PACIFIC.Chinese and Polynesian Labour. -On 14th May the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific informed the Secretary of State that the following telegram, dated 7th April, had been received from Mr. Rowse at Nauru: The Chinese coolies understand that on their arrival the Chinese labourers will be permitted to enter into an agreement with the Company for two or three years. If there is no objection, I propose to act accordingly ; the agreement to be drawn up subject to the approval of the future administration.   Do you approve ?Sir Cecil Rodwell went on to say that he considered that the agreements should be for two years, with the right of renewing for one year, He asked whether the Secretary, of State agreed to this, and also whether there was any objection to.the recruitment of labourers in the Caroline and the Marshall Islands, an agreement to be drawn up as in the case of the Chinese.SOOTHERN RHODESIA.Petition for Responsible Government.  On 12th May the High Commissioner for South Africa telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, saying that the Resident Commissioner of Southern Rhodesia had reported on 10th May that Sir Charles Coghlan would that day move the following resolutions in the Legislative Council:-(1) That this absolute majority of the wdiole number of members of the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia humbly prays the King&apos;s * Most Excellent Majesty in Council to establish forthwith in Southern Rhodesia the form of Government known as responsible government, which this territory urgently requires for the proper development of its resources and the freedom and prosperity of its people.(2) The said absolute majority of the Legislative Council tenders the following-evidence in support of the above resolution: (1) As to the financial fitness, (a) the information contained in the administrative records and accounts of expenditure and of the revenues raised by taxation from the people of this territory during the past 12 years, and (6) the declared policy of the British South Africa Company that the people of this territory shall for the future be required to provide the cost of the public services. The above, it is humbly submitted, establish that the territory is fully self-supporting, and must for the future depend upon its own financial resources.. (2) As to fitness in other respects, that the record of the people of Southern Rhodesia establishes that they are capable of fulfilling in the interests of all the inhabitants thereof, irrespective of race, the duties of self-government, and are as able to bear the responsibilities thereof as other peoples of thelunpire to whom the right of self-government has been granted in the past. That should the references to the facts above stated be considered insufficient proof to justify His Majesty in Council acting in accordance with the prayer in this resolution contained, the people
of this territory are prepared to and hereby offer to adduce any further evidence required in such manner and method as the.King in Council may be graciously pleased to direct.Telegraphing again on 18th May, Lord Buxton said that the Resident Commissioner of Southern Rhodesia had further reported that after four days&apos; debate, in which all the members had participated, Sir Charles Coghlan&apos;s motion was adopted on 17th May by 12 votes to 5. The Postmaster-General had voted with the majority ; Fletcher with the minority; the Treasurer was absent unwell, as also, according to a Press telegram, was Leggate; the nominated members were-left free to vote as they pleased.ReuteFs agent, telegraphing from Salisbury on 17th May, said that the minority had only opposed the motion on the ground that it was premature, and that the desired regime wotdd have no potential sources of revenue.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xvi;., p. Sj.-During the suspension of official discussions, informal conversations have been held and communications have been exchanged which, although not recognized as being official, have resulted in a more satisfactory position. &apos; ..&apos; .The Viceroy transmitted [587 S.] on 10th May a telegram from Mr. Dobbs reporting the outcome of a conversation between himself and Tarsi with Ghulam Muhammed, Abdul Qayum also being present. In reiterating more fully the Afghan objects, Tarsi said that they were, firstly : their desire to form an offensive&apos; and defensive alliance with us against the Bolsheviks, and to relieve certain cities of Turkestan from Russian influence, provided we met them by frontier concessions, especially by the cession of Waziristan ; secondly, they were desirous of our help in the development of their country, especially as regarded mines, in the development of which they were willing to grant us a monopoly ; thirdly, they hoped for financial support from us to further their internal development. Mr. Dobbs, in reply, maintained the practical certainty that no frontier concessions would be made, which appeared to have a disconcerting effect on the Afghan delegates, who professed themselves unable to face either their own tribes or ours without some form of purdah on this point after what have happened in the war. Eventually Tarsi undertook to write privately giving the three Afghan desiderata; and pressed Mr. Dobbs to return to Cabul in order to deal direct with the Amir.On 14th May the Viceroy transmitted [610 S.] a further telegram from Mr. Dobbs, recounting another informal meeting at which Abdul Hadi attempted to explain and justify the frontier incidents, and asked for an undertaking on our part to abstain from operations in Waziristan during the Conference, wfiich, he said, the Amir had meant to be a condition of. the preliminary meeting. Mr. Dobbs refused . to give any such assurance, but while Tarsi did not seem disposed to insist on the Waziristan formula, Abdul Hadi made it apparent that he had distinct orders from Cabul on the point.The Viceroy transmitted [617 S.] a telegram from Mr. Dobbs on 15th May giving the contents of a letter from Tarsi, in which he stated the ability of the&apos; Afghans, to retire from Tandisar and to keep in check Abdul Rahman Khan,-the brother of the Mehtar of Chitral. The letter went on to say, &quot; but according to your own statement no aggression or interference should take place on the part cf opposite party until our discussions end in a settlement. You have no doubt up to this time obtained hint or permission from His Excellency the Viceroy in this matter.&quot;Mr. Dobbs submitted for. approval the following reply: -&quot; I am much gratified that Afghan Government at your instance has recognized and accepted the friendly wishes of the Government of India in the matter of the frontier incidents which had temporarily interrupted our conversations. My Government will arrange that during our conversations at Mussoorie our forces shall not occupy Tandisar, so that there shall be no action on our side which might give rise to local misunderstandings. I need not assure you that if the Tandisar and Chitral incidents are satisfactorily adjusted, the British authorities will, as always, do their best to prevent any appearance of aggression or hostility on their side and I trust we may then. be able to resume our discussions with good hope of mutual profit.&quot;
This proposed -reply was approved by: the. Government of India,, who drew attention, however, to the fact that in the correspondence no mention.had been&apos;made of Waziristan. The approval of the reply was therefore qualified by the condition that Tarsi should be left in no doubt that the&apos; understanding given &quot; to prevent any appearance of aggression or hostility &quot; referred solely to Afghan territory and not to Waziristan.A later telegram from Mr. Dobbs, transmitted [621 S.] by the Viceroy on 18th May, recorded the receipt by him of two letters fromTarsi. The first assumed that frontier incidents were satisfactorily settled, and intimated that a reply should now be sent to the request that operations in Waziristan should be suspended. The second commented on the Turkish settlement as the outcome, of religious bigotry directed against Islam, and asked for an explanation of our policy. Mr. Dobbs replied to the first letter that until all Afghan forces were withdrawn to the Afghan side, frontier incidents could not be held to be satisfactorily adjusted, he was unable therefore to give an official reply to Tarsi&apos;s questions. Mr. Dobbs did not propose to send any reply to the second letter other than a Persian translation of the official announcement regarding the Turkish terms. Mr. Dobbs had reason to believe that the Amir was insisting that Tarsi should get from him a written reply concerning the suspension of operations in Waziristan;The Viceroy telegraphed [657 S.] on, 25th May the news that the Afghans had evacuated both Tandisar and Lambabat, but no information had been received that official conversations had been resumed. Mr. Dobbs&apos; belief as to the Amirs instruc-tions regarding a written reply had been confirmed by information from a perfectly reliable source. Equally good information was to the effect that Nasrulla, who had beeu reported as murdered in Cabuf [F.O.R., xvii., p. 2], had died on 19th May, having been &quot; attended by his own doctor &quot; daring a month&apos;s illness.The Viceroy^ Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on 7th and 14th May respectively: . I. (7th May).-Last week&apos;s reports indicated that in Northern India the Caliphate agitation showed some signs of subsiding, though liable to respond to any fresh stimulus. This has been supplied by the speech of the Amir of Afghanistan in which he is reported to have expressed sympathy with the Indian Mohameclans, and to have offered to admit into his territory any -who wished to emigrate on account of their religion; by the publication of a fatwa emanating from Afghanistan discouraging the sacrifice of cattle ; and by the announcement of the head of the Afghan Mission .at Mussoorie that the chief object of that Mission is to secure just and honourable terms for Turkey. Various members of the extremist party have attributed their greater or less success to getting into touch with the deputation. In consequence, there has been excitement to a considerable degree in the North-West Frontier Province and the Punjab, though the publication yesterday of an authentic version of the latter speech shows the first reports of it to have been exaggerated. In the former province we thotight it necessary, on receipt of a report of a disquieting character, to give the Chief Commissioner power to increase the police force at his discretion in view of the possible effect of the agitation on the young Moslem sepoys, and of the ruraFclasses becoming adversely affected towards us; he has also been furnished with extra rifles to arm the police. In the Punjab, the agitation is said not to be spreading rapidly among the rural classes-but Caliphate agitators are making great efforts to win them over, arid in some, places they are becoming disaffected. Mission schools are being boycotted; and a number of boys in such schools in Rawalpindi, Amritsar, Julhmdur, and Ludhiana have been removed and sent to national educational institutions. Two Mohamedan holders of Kursi Nashim certifi-cates have returned them owing to their feeling on the Caliphate question. The depth of Mohamedan feeling- in general in the Punjab is not in doubt, but deputations, in spite of strongly worded resolutions, promise not to overstep bounds. The proposed fate of Syria, Smyrna and Thrace is inexplicable to Moslems.2. A reassuring report has been received on the situation in Sind. The violence -of the previous agitation has to some extent defeated itself, the mass of the people being-loyally disposed and disinclined for direct action, and only likely to be roused by appeals to protect their religion when it is represented as endangered. The extremists, as elsewhere, are, however, most active, coming more into the open, and adopting a bolder front. The powers taken to proclaim Sind under the Seditious Meetings Act have not been exercised, as it is thought that such action might force the hands of those who are now inclined to hold back the extreme forms of propa-ganda. Action has therefore beeu confined to warning individuals or papers 16-4 B
overstepping limits, and a more liberal resort to the District Police Act to control Caliphate meetings. Sincl will probably not act on its own initiative, but take its-colour from Bombay, Lucknow and Delhi.3. More moderate councils prevail in Bombay, where the Central Caliphate Com-mittee is considerably exercised over the resolutions passed by the Delhi Caliphate Workers&apos; Conference, and is proposing a further conference in Bombay on account of the practical difficulties in the way of non-co-operation. Lucknow is the centre of an influential clique headed by Abdul Bari, whose fanaticism has led him to address the Afghan Mission at Mussoorie with a view to Hijrat and to invoke their aid in regard to the Turkish peace terms and the dismemberment of the Turkish Empire, including Thrace; but in Lucknow a contrary influence is also at work-the Shiahs have definitely dissociated themselves from the Caliphate agitation and the Raja of Mahmudabad stands aloof. The United Provinces report shows generally that the Caliphate question has not been outwardly so prominent and that the Hindus are continuing to withdraw co-operation. Subterranean propaganda is, however, carried on by minor agitators, efforts being made by district workers to familiarize the masses with&apos; the ideas of a Jehad and Hijrat.   But neither idea is likely to take root.4. The Caliphate Workers&apos; Conference at Delhi was attended only by delegates of little importance and was marked at once by the absence of reputable extremists and the violence of language advocating a Jehad or Hijrat. A Hijrat office has now been opened in the city, and it is stated that some 50 names from Delhi have been enrolled. The Iman of the Jumma Masjid Mosque has been subjected to persecution by the extremists ; after a meeting lasting three hours ancl as a result of the pressure brought to bear on him by the extremist Maulvis of Delhi and the United Provinces to resign his societies, it is now reported that he has complied with the demand and will also resign the Iman ship. Be was a man of weight and moderation, but it is too early yet to say how far the resignation&apos;of titles begun by Hakim Ajmal Khan will spread in Delhi. The application of the Seditious Meetings Act, described in the extremist Press as a recrudescence of repression, may have a sobering effect, and is said to have pleased the Delhi moderates.5. Shaukat Ali continues his campaign of violence, having addressed meetings recently at Patna, Gaya, ancl Monghyr. The meetings were characterized by (a) language that, by reason of its violence and disloyalty, would justify criminal prosecution in that he said that Indian Mohamedans should, in the event of the invasion of India by Afghanistan, assist the invaders ; (It) the absence from the meetings of the from-nent leaders of opinion. Jn view of the want of real support from local people no-action is proposed against him on this occasion, but the legal aspect of the case is being examined with a view to specifying the exact offence committed by such violent speakers, and the expediency of warning the promoters of similar meetings in future that prompt action will be taken on the recurrence of such speech is being considered.The Bihar Government believe the agitation will die out unless external events inflame it. Bengal reports that Mohamedan feeling is quiet, but that the agitation continues. The Nawab of Dacca has issued a statement strongly dissociating himself from the violent speeches and demonstrations regarding the Caliph.6. The situation generally is on the whole reassuring. Although our police reports are alarming we think-that they are over-coloured; but at the same time the extremist section is becoming more violent than ever, and it is quite impossible to say with any certainty what the result of the publication.of the peace terms will be if Mohamedan feeling, particularly in northern India, is excited over it. Ancl there is always the danger that outbreaks occurring in a few local areas may precipitate disorder elsewhere.7. Gandhi has issued a further manifesto that the San Remo decision is discussed-quieting to Mohamedans and calls for the greatest self-restraint. Non-co-operation is urged as the only method, the slightest violence being strongly deprecated. He has been elected president of the -Home Rule League, and has stated that he will carry the members with him in activities such as the Swaclhesi Hindu-Moslem Unity with special reference to the Caliphate question, ancl the establishment of Hindustani as a lingua franca. Hitherto he has been alone among the Hindu leaders in countenancing the more violent extravagances of the Caliphate agitation, ancl is said to have felt his position of isolation. The new movement may render the situation more difficult, especially if he attempts to impress on the Home Rule League the policy of non-co-operation with its four steps. But-his election is obscure ancl does not appear to have been with the consent of the -provincial councils.   The National Home Rule League
also will find co-operation with, the Home Rule League impossible. Instead of increasing non-co-operation among the extremist leaders there is ample evidence that Gandhi&apos;s refusal to proceed homeward with a second Caliphate deputation has given rise to some misgiving among Mohamedans, especially Abdul Kalam Azad, as to the disinterestedness of his motives. Khaparde and Tilak do not see eye to eye with Gandhi, and Lajpat Rai attacks Tilak. B. P. Pal has written an article in the Allahabad Independent, on the necessity of the extremist party pursuing a policy-of non-co-operation in the Reforms Councils with a view to forcing Parliament to bring in a new Reform Bill, on the ground that this is what those who voted for the Amritsar resolutions really meant. This will conflict with Gandhi&apos;s offer of co-operation in regard to reforms made at Amritsar.8. An important strike has occurred on the North-Western Railway ; some 5,000 men employed in the railway carriage and wagon workshops in Moghulpura and Lahore went on strike at mid-day on 24th April, the ostensible cause being the dismissal of (? seven) fitters of the gas and vacuum shops for refusing to obey orders. The leaders of the North-Western Railway Union were surprised by the strike, but decided to proceed with it, with the probable intention of securing the recognition of the Union and testing its strength. On the 27th the railway power-house employes struck work, and those of the loco-workshops on the 29th. The latest development is that the traffic staff have also joined in the strike and the working of trains is very restricted. Demonstrations are orderly, but the political leaders Lajpat Rai and Zafar Ali have been interesting themselves in the strike, which is now being run by Miller. On the 30th there was a strike in the press of the Lahore Civil and Military Gazette, inspired by the railway strikers on account of an article piiblished in the issue of 29th entitled &quot; Playing with fire &quot; and commenting on the railway employees.9. There is a good deal of interest at present displayed in the Press on the publication of the Hunter Report, and some intelligent anticipations of the findings. The publication of the Report will undoubtedly result in some agitation in the Press and on the platform.II. (14th May). The Caliphate agitation has been less in evidence so far as outward manifestations go; meetings have decreased in number and the opinion is expressed that the agitation has been weakened by its own violence and is now largely sustained by the stimulus of the extremist Press. We -fear, however, this is only a lull due in part to the knowledge that people cannot be indefinitely kept at a high pitch of excitement, and we expect a revival of the agitation in a more virulent form after the publication of the peace terms with Turkey because (1) the extremists are no less violent; (2) the doctrine of Hijrat and the hopes centring in Afghanistan suggest the possibility of a refuge therefor the disaffected, who allege they are prepared to carry their professions into practice; (3) there is ample evidence of fanaticism among the illiterate, though it is by no means widespread.2. As to (1) we will refer only to two recent Caliphate conferences, one at Jacobabad in Sind, and the other at Shahjehanpur, in the United Provinces. At the former, the resolution moved :  In view of the increasing hostility and the total disregard shown by British statesmen towards the Caliphate and Moslem demands, this conference is strongly of opinion that there is no way left to Moslems except to inaugurate non-co-operation as enjoined by the Shariat. The mover said the talk of non-co-operation was a mockery without deeds and announced the resignation of his membership of the local board and the municipal council, his privileges as a 2nd class Sardar, and the profit of barristership, and expressed his readiness to refuse to pay all taxes should the Ulema so desire. Many Zamindars have expressed a determination to act in like manner and a number of Mullahs renounced the grants in aid of their schools. One Zamindar gave up a quarter of his land, valued at 25,000, for Caliphate work. The Shahjehanpur conference was attended by some 5,000 persons, including some military men, and was marked by characteristically lengthy sittings and violence of speech by Hazrat Mohani, who deprecated the conditional policy hitherto followed and urged Moslems to begin at once what they have to do. He condemned the Allies&apos; terms regarding Smyrna and Thrace and pointed out that the doctrines of Bolshevism and of Islam in their two great principles of liberty and equality are identical. The compact alleged to exist between the Russian Soviet Government and the Young Turk Party, if true, will strengthen the hands of the extremists.
. 3. As to (2) this attitude has been encouraged by the presence of the Afghan delegates at Mussoorie, whose early conduct, already reported, was provocative of hope to fanatical Moslems, who regard Afghanistan as a Moslem Power still able to treat on equal terms with Great Britain. Sane intellectual Indians know the futility of this and realize very clearly the grave clanger to themselves of any foolish coquetting with the Afghans, whom, in reality, they cordially detest; but an extremist, Azad Subhani, declared that one of their kings was thrice Caliph of Afghanistan and that they are bound to listen to any command of the Amir of Afghanistan. From the point of view of internal politics the continued presence of the delegates in India is undesirable. One of them indeed has had to:be sent back to Afghanistan on account of his behaviour towards an European girl as it is possible her relatives would have prosecuted him.4. As to (3) we have consistently referred in our weekly telegrams to subterranean propaganda. Two instances of the extravagances of illiterate Mussulmans will indicate the potential clangers of this, though at present we do not believe this policy is widespread,: (a) at Jaunpur (United Provinces) an extremist who had attended the Caliphate Workers&apos; Conference in Delhi told the people of Jaunpur, bigoted but simple Mohamedans, that the conference was.attended by six or seven hundred Mohamedans of the Punjab, who came armed with the sword, declaring that they were prepared to sacrifice their lives for Islam, and that if a leading Moslem declared a Jehad they would follow him ; (b) an (corrupt group) Maulvi was found at Iiowrah preaching to some illiterate persons, that the Bolshevists, Afghans, Persia, and Turkey would invade India if the Caliphate question were not settled to the satisfaction of Indian opinion.5. The mainlines of the Caliphate movement remain unchanged; there are at present no indications of any organized outbreaks, but there is - a possibility of individual (corrupt group) of (? local) fanaticism and of local disorder which, if it once breaks out, may spread rapidly. It is, as reported before, impossible to say with any certainty what the effect of the publication of the terms null be ; we do not, however, at present propose any change of policy, and are averse from action under any but the ordinary law if it can be avoided. The Provinces- for the mos-t part concur in this view, but Madras urges the externment of Shaukat Ali, and Punjab now asks for the application of the Seditious Meetings Act, and proposes action under the Defence of India Rules owing to the situation being complicated by the railway strike at Lahore, the organization of which has been captured by the extremist politicians. We have directed Madras to refrain from further action on the linos proposed until we see how the situation is affected by the publication of the peace terms and His Excellency&apos;s message to the Indian Moslems; We have sanctioned the notification of the proclama-tion of the Lahore and Amritsar districts under the Act with reluctance, instructing the Lieutenant-Covernor to defer action under it, if possible, until we see how the Turkish terms are received, as we prefer to associate such action with the Caliphate agitation rather than with the strike, and asking him only to use the powers when inevitable. As to.action under the Defence of India Rules, we have asked for a reference to us before any restrictions are imposed on individuals, as we are aware you are very averse from action of this kind, and we fear such action might precipitate trouble.   Delhi is reported to be quiet.6. The strike at Lahore spread to other departments of the line, the pointsmen, the interlocking signal staff, the clearers, the carriage washers, the sweepers and the coolies having joined MilleFs &quot; Army of Martyrs &quot; in their perambulations through the city. The train service is reduced, and Miller made attempts on the posts and telegraph employees and the domestic servants of Europeans. The situation, however, which was getting worse day by day, and of which there were no signs of immediate settlement up to the evening of 9th May, seems to be improving. The Fforth-Western Railway authorities have now issued a notice to their employees on strike which contains announcements to the following effect: In the first place arrangements are being made for the immediate payment to strikers of money due for work clone in March or April; secondly, the orders dismissing seven men who originated the strike are cancelled, and the men will be reappointed if ready to undertake the duties imposed on them ; further, the stipulation that the men should return to.work unconditionally is withdrawn,and all strikers who will at once return to work will be reappointed on the pay which they were drawing at the time of the strike, subject to the effect of the rules regarding break of service : they will be subjected to no fine or penalty whatever for having been on strike. Lastly, any representation regarding pay and conditions of service which may be put
forward after the men return to work will be carefully considered. The railway authorities hope that their announcement will remove all justifications for the men remaining longer on strike.But we cannot say that the situation is hopeful at present. The strikers are well disciplined and carry out the instructions of Miller implicitly. It is interesting to note that in the strike of employees of the Civil and Military Gazette in sympathy with the railway strike other presses of Lahore came to the help of the Civil and Military Gazette. We have just received a report that 25,000 strikers are now out at Ahmadabad, and the military have been asked to remain in readiness.7. It is reported that Lajpat Rai will shortly begin the issue of a daily Urdu paper to be called Bande Mataram. It will run as a joint stock company, and a limited liability corporation has been registered, with a capital of one lakh, Harkishen Lai having taken Rs. 5,000 worth of shares. Fifty per cent, of the capital has been subscribed already. Eventually an. English daily will also be started. The tone of these papers will be extremist.8. There continues to be speculation about the Hunter Report, and a belief that the delay in publication is due to a difference between the Government of India and. His Majesty&apos;s Government. Dyer&apos;s interview with the Daily Mail has excited con-siderable comment of varying character. Surprise is also expressed at the poor reception accorded in the English Press to the Congress Report. The scheme for purchasing Jallianwala Bagh for the nation is likely to fail, as two and a half lakhs are still required and payment had to be made on 7th May.9. The fracas between the police and some Hurs in Sind, which we briefly reported in our weekly telegram dated 7th May, has been fully investigated. It transpires that the shots were fired to save one of the Hurs from his fellows.10. The approaching visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has been acclaimed all over the country, and. arrangements ar-e in progress to accord him a loyal and enthusiastic reception. The extremists have hitherto kept quiet, but they are well aware that any jarring note would be bad tactics, and would increase their unpopularity.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA. sRepresentation of Canadian Interests at Wasldngton. On 10th May the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, saying that the following statement.would be made in Parliament ancl in Canada that day : As a result of recent discussions an arrangement has been concluded between the British and the Canadian Governments to provide more complete representation at Washington of Canadian interests than has hitherto existed. Accordingly, it has been agreed that His Majesty, on the advice of his Canadian Ministers, shall appoint a Minister Plenipotentiary, who will have charge of-Canadian affairs ancl will at all times be the ordinary channel of communication with the United States Government in matters of purely Canadian concern, acting upon instructions from, ancl reporting direct to, the Canadian Government. In the absence of the Ambassador the Canadian Minister will take charge of the whole Embassy and of the representation of Imperial as well as of Canadian interests. He will be accredited by His Majesty to the President with the necessary powers for the purpose.This new arrangement will not denote any departure, either on the part of the British Government or of the Canadian Government, from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the British Empire.The need for this important step has been fully realized by both Governments for some time. For a good many years there has been direct communication between Washington and Ottawa; but the constantly increasing importance of Canadian interests in the United States had made it apparent that Canada should be represented there in some distinctive manner, for this would doubtless tend to expedite negotiations and naturally first-hand acquaintance with Canadian conditions would promote good understanding. &apos; In view of the peculiarly close relations that have 16-1 C
always existed between the people of. Canada and those of the United States, it is confidently expected as well that this new step will have the very desirable result of maintaining and strengthening friendly relations and co-operation between the British Empire and the United States.International Financial Conference. The Dominion representatives at the International Financial Conference to be held at Brussels on 28th May will be Sir George Perley, High Commissioner in London, Mr. J. H. Gundy, of Toronto, and Mr. G. C. Cassells, London manager of the Bank of Montreal.International Labour Conference. Sir George Perley, Mr. G. J. Desbarats, Mr. Thomas Robb, and Mr. G. J. Gauthier will represent the Dominion at the International Labour Conference at Genoa.Agricultural Wealth of Canada. According to a telegram sent on 19th May by the Director of Information, Dr. Tolmie, Federal Minister of Agriculture, estimates the total agricultural wealth of Canada to be $7,000,380,000,000, the value of agricultural production last year being $1,000,975,000,000. The Dominion Govern-ment will spent $1,200,000 on experimental and demonstration farms this year.AUSTRALIA.Sugar. The following telegram from the Governor-General was sent to the Secretary of State, on 21st May :-It is estimated that from 100,000 to 130,000 tons of foreign sugar will have to be purchased for consumption in Australia during the months April to July 1921, and the Government would therefore be grateful if the British authorities would consider the feasibility of arranging for the purchase of an extra 100,000 tons of sugar for Australia when making their own large purchases. My Ministers hope that, by buying through His Majest3^&apos;s Government, competition will be avoided, and so the price will be much less than if Australia v-ent on the open market.NEW ZEALAND.Meat [B.E.R., xiv., p. 9, and xvii., p. 8]. On 20th May the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State as follows : -The Prime Minister feels considerable anxiety regarding the prospects of the New Zealand frozen meat trade, and has asked me to make further urgent representa-tions to you on the matter as no reply has yet been received to my telegrams of 22nd March, 9th April, and 5th May. Since the despatch of the first-mentioned telegram it has become increasingly evident that a great financial difficulty must arise when the new season opens, unless fully adequate arrangements are made for relief. Owing to the serious delays in the arrival of the refrigerated steamers, the New Zealand stores are now filled to their utmost capacity, in consequence of which a large quantity of stock, which under ordinary conditions would have been slaughtered before 30th June, would have to be dealt with after that date. It will thus be seen that an extension of the Imperial purchase to December at least is a matter of vital necessity to this-country. Emphasis is also laid on the fact that, even under the best shipping arrangements that could be hoped for, heavy stocks of meat owned by the Imperial Government must necessarily remain in store, in the Dominion and in the United Kingdom, when the new season opens, and in due course be marketed in conjunction, with such free meat as can be shipped. This, combined with the delay which must arise in shipping the new season&apos;s free meat, will depreciate ,market values for live-stock, in the Dominion, and for frozen meat, to such an extent as to create serious financial difficulties for producers. It is evident that only the provision of the greatest amount of refrigerated tonnage available and an extension of Government purchases can enable the position to be met. A representative meeting of producers-is to be held on 27th May, and a reply before that date is greatly desired. It is-earnestly hoped that you will do all you can to impress His Majesty&apos;s Government with the seriousness of the position with which the Dominion is faced and of the necessity of affording the relief indicated.Relief for Austria and Poland [B.E.R., xv., p. 4].-On 11th May the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State that the Government of New Zealand regretted that it did not see its way at present to participate in the scheme.
SOUTH AFRICA.Locomotives ordered from Germany. On 17th May the Governor-General sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State: My Ministers state that d tiring 1913 the Railways and Harbours Administration ordered through the High Commis-sioner for South Africa 10 locomotives from the firm J. A. Maffei of Munich, of which two only were delivered before the outbreak of war. They are now advised that the remaining eight engines have been completed and are now lying at Munich. In view of the fact that the Railways and Harbours Administration did not receive any engines during the war, my Ministers enquire whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could arrange for negotiations to be entered into with a view to ascertaining whether this stock could be secured, and if so, on.what terms delivery to the Railways and Harbours Administration could be made. As 40 large engines have recently been found defective and removed from traffic, the matter is one of great urgency, and my Ministers would be grateful if it could receive early attention.Finance. On 18th May the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State as follows : My Ministers enquire whether, in the event of the Union adopting the system of fully-backed but temporarily inconvertible gold certificates with the condition that part of the gold backing might be held outside the Union, it will be practicable for the Union Treasury to obtain from the Bank of England at par and hold in London gold coin representing such proportion of the reserve as it might be decided to hold in the United Kingdom, or alternatively for the Hank of England to retain but ear-mark such gold coin to the order of the Union Treasury. It is understood that such coin will have to remain in London until the embargo on gold coin from the United Kingdom is lifted. As the Bank of England note and the Imperial currency note are legally convertible, the Government of the Union of South Africa think such an arrangement feasible, and if so it would go a long way towards solving a difficulty of considerable magnitude.The Union Constitution. On 19th May, ReuteFs Capetown agent further reported that in the Union House of Assembly that clay there had been an expression of general dissatisfaction with the method laid down by the South Africa Act for the election of the Senate replacing the present body, whose term had been declared by statute to expire on 31st October next. Replying to criticisms, General Smuts proposed to convene, during the recess, a conference of all parties, similar to the SpeakeFs Conference of Great Britain, for the purpose of drafting a new constitution for the Senate.The Asiatic Question. ReuteFs agent reported from Capetown on 19th May that Sir Abe Bailey had that clay presented a monster petition to the Union House of Assembly praying Parliament to take steps to deal with the Asiatic menace ; 80,000 signatures were appended to the petition.&quot; Profiteering. The same agent also reported that on 19th May the Union House of Assembly had passed the second reading of the Bill for preventing speculation in foodstuffs, the third Government measure dealing with the cost of living.
