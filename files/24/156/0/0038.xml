The following paragraphs have been taken from the reports of the Ministry of -Labour issued on 19th and 26th February : Deputations to Ministers. Deputations from the British and Scottish trades union congresses have been received during the week [ending 15th February] at various Ministries, and have put forward certain subjects to which they wish the Government to direct their attention during the forthcoming parliamentary session. It is interesting to note that the trades union congress, held at Portsmouth in September last, passed a resolution which, in effect, deprecated this form of approaching the Government, but that, nevertheless, the time-honoured procedure of deputations to Ministers has been continued. The deputation received by the Minister of Labour on the 11th February, besides dealing with resolutions concerning trade boards and other matters, which were passed by the Portsmouth congress, raised two important new questions. The first of these related to the desirability of extension of unemploy-ment benefit in the case of those who have exhausted the maximum number of weeks allowed by statute ; it was stated by the Minister that the Government are now considering this problem from a more general point of view since similar questions are arising, or have arisen, in the case of those persons receiving benefit under the 1911 Act, the 1920 Act, and the special arrangements made for ex-service men.Wages Reduction. The wages reduction movement continues in various parts.of the country, being especially noticeable in certain branches of the engineering and metal trades of the Midlands ; but no cases of outstanding interest have yet arisen, though, as will be seen below, the present tension in the coal industry is not unconnected with a fear of wages reductions. Following on a meeting of the Ship-building Employers&apos; Federation at Edinburgh on the 18th February, the secretary of this body issued a statement to the press to the effect that the federation would not put forward proposals for the reduction of wages unless no other means of reducing the cost of production could be found. The recent fall in the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index-number by 14 points-from 165 to 151-will, of course, affect a number of trades, the agreements in which are based upon a cost-of-living sliding scale, but in most cases these reductions do not become immediately operative.Unemployment. The question of unemployment continues to dominate the labour situation, and the consequent drain upon the funds of the trade unions is apparently responsible for their adoption of a more passive and. defensive policy, and a growing disinclination for extreme measures of any kind. In this connexion, it is interesting to note that the funds of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation are said to be seriously depleted already, and that it is proposed to raise a levy in aid of unemployed members.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Protectorate. Telegraphing [No. 119] to Lord Allenby on 22nd February, Lord Gurzon authorized him to make the following declaration to the Sultan :  His Majesty&apos;s Government, after a study of the proposals made by Lord Milner, have arrived at the conclusion that the status of protectorate is not a satisfactory relation in which Egypt should continue to stand to Great Britain. While they have not reached final decisions with regard to Lord milner&apos;s recommendations, they desire to confer regarding them with a delegation nominated by the Sultan with a view, if possible, to substitute for the protectorate a relationship which would, while securing the special interests of Great, Britain and enabling her to offer adequate guarantees to foreign Powers, meet the legitimate aspirations of Egypt and the Egyptian people.On 26th February Lord Allenby reported [Nos. 130, 131], that he had communi-cated the declaration to the Sultan, and in the covering letter had remarked that he
was sure it would facilitate the latter&apos;s task of nominating an official delegation- He had also called the SultaiPs attention to the spirit of goodwill which had been shown by the British . Government making this declaration in advance of the official negotiations.In. subsequent interviews the Sultan had thanked him warmly for the terms of &quot; his letter, which, he agreed, would greatly facilitate his task.    He proposed to approach Adly Pasha, Wahba Mazloum, Sirri aud perhaps one or two others.   As to Zagloul, he intended to consult Adly Pasha.PALESTINE.Trans-Jordania. On 22nd. February Sir Herbert Samuel telegraphed [No. 72] that it was reported that the Emir Abdulla would arrive at, Amman on the next day but one ; he, Sir Herbert, had instructed the British representative at that, place to retire to Salt in the event of the emir coming to Amman.On receipt of this telegram Lord Curzon instructed [No. 95] Sir Herbert Samuel that the British, representative should only be withdrawn from Amman if he were in danger. Lord Curzou also suggested that Mr. Storrs might be sent to welcome the -emir as an emissary from King Hussein proceeding to Amman, it was assumed, to -check the propaganda against France.Telegraphing again [No. 81] on 24th February, after receipt of Lord Ourzon&apos;s telegram, Sir Herbert Samuel reported that he had cancelled the instructions he had given in regard to withdrawal, as he apprehended no personal danger to the British representative at Amman. If Mr. Storrs were sent, he went on to say, he feared that it would be regarded as a definite proof of our concurrence, in the sheriff an movement against the French ; there was a widespread impression that we connived at it. More than this, the sending of Mr. Storrs to welcome Emir Abdulla would go far to destroy what still remained of the authority of the local governments in Trans-Jordania, which, had been weakened by the visit of Sherif Ali.Sir Herbert added that reliable information indicated that Emir Abdulla desired --above all things the continued presence of British officials in Trans-Jordania, as a proof to the people that his movement had our support; and further that he was most anxious not to displease, the British Government. His movement was not making headway.INDIA.Mission in Kabul [B.E.R., xxxvii, p. 4]. The Viceroy transmitted [189 S.] a telegram dated 10th February from Sir Henry Dobbs, in which he stated that the projected, private meeting with Tarsi had been held, and that he had produced his draft amendments, premising that they had not received Government authority. After repeating his arguments as to the necessity of giving independence to the tribes, Tarsi endeavoured, without success, to induce Sir Henry to discuss the clauses other than No. 8. Finally, Tarsi stated his doubts if the amendments would meet Afghan views and undertook&apos; to place them before the Amir.On 12th February Sir Henry Dobbs reported, through the Viceroy&apos;s telegram. [204 S.] of. 15th February that the Afghans had made no sign since the interview recorded in the preceding telegram. He suggested that he should be authorized to leave for India immediately should his proposals be rejected by the Afghans, without -discussing any other question except the evacuation of Arnawai. He considered that the forcible occupation of Arnawai by the Afghans after breaking off negotiations s would be intolerable, and that the attitude that they might adopt in regard to this would be a fair test of their future behaviour.In reply to this the Viceroy had sent Sir Henry instructions to the effect that it. would be desirable before breaking off negotiations to hold a formal meeting at winch lie should sum up the position, and make it clear that the Government of India, acting under the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, had been reluctantly forced to abandon negotiations for the reason already explained. After this, he -should present a note calling for the evacuation, of Arnawai within one mouth, failing-
which measures might have to be taken to stop all trade with Afghanistan. A time-limit of 48 hours was suggested for reconsideration by the Afghans, if it were-requested.The Secretary of State telegraphed [1098] to the Viceroy on 19th February giving his views on the course of the discussions between Sir Henry Dobbs and the Afghans. In view of what had passed, and of the knowledge that the Bolsheviks had&apos; decided to ratify the treaty with them, and that there were indications that the Afghans intended to do the same, the Secretary of State-considered that it was of&quot; importance that the Afghans should be reminded that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention of concluding a treaty with them unless they were entirely satisfied as to the terms of the treaty with the Bolsheviks. The ratification of this treaty without communicating its text to His Majesty&apos;s Government would oblige us to break off negotiations.On 20th February the Viceroy transmitted [220 S. and 231 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs containing &quot;a summary of a draft treaty on the lines of which he wished authority to proceed. This draft consisted of sixteen clauses, dealing generally with the questions raised in the Afghan draft treaty [B.E.E., xxxvi, p. 5], reproducing his draft substitute for the Afghan clause 8, modified in accordance with the suggestions of the Secretary of State [B.E.R., xxxvii, p. 4], and undertaking... subject to the complete fulfilment by the Afghans of the engagements stipulated in the preceding clauses, to make an annual payment of 18 lakhs to Afghanistan, as a mark of appreciation of HabibullaVs friendly attitude during the late war.Telegraphing [229 S. and 232 S.] on 21st February, the Viceroy referred to the above summary as having met some of the points raised by the Secretary of State -[1098] and. recommended that authority be given to Sir Henry Dobbs to negotiate on the lines of his draft, increasing, if necessary, the proposed subsidy to the limit of 201 lakhs, which was the amount previously paid to Habibullah.The Secretary of State replied [1172] to the foregoing on 23rd February, saying -that the first impression given by Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; draft taken as a whole was that we had already gone a considerable way in yielding concessions to the Afghans and had gained very little iu return. He emphasized the fact once more, in order to avoid-the possibility of misunderstanding, that the whole position must continue to be governed by the proceedings between the Afghans and the .Bolsheviks, and that without complete satisfaction that the Bolshevik treaty contains nothing directed against our interests, negotiations must lapse. He did not consider that the security clauses in Sir Henry&apos;s draft were satisfactory, and desired in. particular that it should be understood that any treaty providing for the payment of a subsidy by the -. Bolsheviks to the Afghans must ipso facto be held to be objectionable.Subject to tbe above and to certain queries and remarks on points of details, the Secretary of State concurred, in authorizing Sir Henry Dobbs to proceed on his draft as a maximum in the way of concessions, and further that he might use his discretion in increasing the subsidy up to 201- lakhs.The Secretary of State desired the Viceroy, in communicating his views to-Sir Henry Dobbs, to express his confidence in him, and his appreciation of the skill with which he was dealing with a situation of great difficulty.The Viceroy&apos;8 Weekly Reports. The following telegrams were sent by the Viceroy on 17th and 24th February : I. (17th February). Section 1. The functions in connexion with the war memorial and. the laying of the foundation stone of the Legislative Chambers passed off very successfully.Section 2. The Punjab debate passed off very satisfactorily. The resolutions -moved by Jamnadas Dwarkadas were as follows : (1) To declare the firm resolve of the Government- of India to maintain that the connexion of India with the British Empire -is based on the principle of equal partnership and perfect racial equality, Indian lives and Indian honour being held as sacred as British lives and honour; (2) to record his opinion and express regret that the martial law administration in the Punjab of 1919 departed from these principles, and was calculated lo deeply wound the self-respect of the Indian population by subjecting them to unnecessary hardship and humiliation ; (3) to mete out deterrent punishments to the officers who were found guilty of the improper exercise of their powers, and to take steps to relieve the Indian revenue &quot;of all payments towards the pensions, gratuities, or compassionate allowances to such officers; and (4) to satisfy himself that adequate compensation is awarded to the families
-of those killed&apos;or injured at the Jallianwalla Bagh or other /places on the same scale ,as the compensation awarded in the case of Europeans who suffered or were killed., during the Punjab disturbances. He moved the resolutions in an admirable and moderate speech. After discussion, in which the home member and the commander-in-ehief took part, the withdrawal of clause 3 was carried,without a division. The remaining clauses were then carried unanimously. As regards the last clause, the home member intimated that the Government of the Punjab would be asked to deal generously with the cases of persons and relatives of persons injured and killed -at Jallianwalla Bagh. The general tone of the debate -was very good, and the Government may congratulate itself: on the result.Madras. There is little of interest to record about non-co-operation, beyond a marked decrease in the activities of the leaders. The attempts to persuade the students to follow the example of Calcutta have hitherto met with no great success, but there are evidences that the campaign is about to be intensified. A students non-co--operation association has been formed, and premises secured for a national college. At present there is no i-eason to apprehend that the spread of the Calcutta contagion will be serious. In the districts, the non-co-operation movement has made little progress among the students, though from two districts it is reported that some students have left their work. In Malabar the political leaders are embarking on a -campaign for tenancy reform. The movement is fraught with considerable poton-tialities, and gives room for some anxiety, though so far practically no progress has been made. Both the caliphate and nationalist committees at Madras have resolved .that the elections for municipalities and local boards should be exempt from the ban governing participation in the Legislative Council elections. The men have gone back to work at the Buckingham mills, and everything is now proceeding smoothly.Bengal. Below the surface things did not go quite so smoothly for non-co-operation during the Duke&apos;s visit as they had hoped. Transport was not paralysed, the hartal was only (? partially) successful, and failed as a demonstration, as the students began to get uneasy at the complete absence of arrangements to emploo them or continue their education. Das&apos; change of front is suggested to be due ty the fact that Gandhi has convinced him that the non-co-operation movement has now progressed so far that the British Government is (? beaten), aud does not oppose it. A matter of striking demonstrations of power with continued hartals will suffice to bring the Government to its knees, and cause it to surrender in the next few months. On these lines swaraj will be gained in one year. The idea is that Gandhi clings to iswaraj as a mental discipline, and believes, when the Government has surrendered, western civilization will go with it. He still shrinks from violence, though he -admits it as a probable consequence, if the Government does not yield quickly. He is anxious to postpone the evil day, but iudicates that he believes it to be inevitable. Das was not averse to violence in the early stages, but has no wish to bring about -chaos. Pal and Ali Brothers look forward to violence as the first step in the programme of forcibly destroying the present Government, but wish to postpone it until, it can lie general and effective. At the recent election in Tipperah, an illiterate fruit-seller was set up as candidate for the Legislative Council, but, in spite of the rigorous (? vigorous) effort of school boys and non-co-operators, was defeated by a young zamindar. *Bombay. There was an intense campaign on the platform, and in the press to induce students to leave their schools and colleges throughout the month of January. Hot more than 50 or GO boys actually left in Bombay in the early stages, but latterly the movement has had considerable success. All the colleges are seriously affected, and the 6xcitement is spreading to Foona and Konkan. How far the registration of would-be non-co-operators is due to ebullition of feeling, which will evaporate when the students are called on to leave the colleges, is difficult to say.Belvi of Belgaum has retired from the non-co-operation movement again. Under pressure from Gandhi, he had given up practice as a pleader, but since his return, from the Nagpur congress he has resumed practice and fallen out with the leaders of the non-co-operation movement. Five Mohamedan justices of the peace are reported to have resigned office. The non-co-operators are getting at the Bhils with the ostensible -object of taking up temperance and forced-labour questions, but there are elements of danger in the movement owing to the inflammability of these people. From a few districts the reports show that difficulty may be experienced in collecting the land revenue. There has been a partial failure of crops in these districts, and the movement is possibly an attempt to secure the usual remissions of revenue. A social /boycott is being brought to bear to force servants to leave the service of landlords. 26-1 B
Section 3. Three days&apos; hartal was observed at Sukkur during the visit of the-commissioner of Sind, owing to income tax grievances. Lajpat Rai, the president-elect of the All-India rai]waymen&apos;s conference, has resigned, and Baptists has also-vacated the chairmanship of the reception committee, owing to the strong feeling-amongst the railwaymen, who apparently,refuse to identify the promoters with political parties,Section 4. &quot;United Provinces. Attempts are being made to boycott an important district exhibition in Moratlabad. An agitation against the provision of supplies and carriages to officers on tour is prominent, in places. Schoolmasters, patwaris, chaukidars and students show restiveness, though with the first three classes the-trouble is mainly economic.Section 5.-The students  at  Benares are again &quot;moving, organizing non-co--operation against educational institutions.    Encouraged by a visit from Gandhi, 200 men in the Oudh and Rohilkuiid workshop struck work on the 10th.   Attempts, were made to hold tip a mail train-outside the station and interfere with the driver,, who was injured.   The city magistrate was struck in the face by a brick.   The commissioner on arrival found two Indian barristers addressing large mass meetings. Police arrangements were made to enable the trains to proceed.   Many left work, owing to intimidation.   The commissioner reports that the trouble is temporary and will subside.   A crowd, estimated in a press message at about 70,000, probably an exaggeration, drawn from Lucknow and the surrounding districts, assembled to hear-Gandhi, who addressed the railway strikers, saying he could not advise them either to-strike or not to strike.   Addressing the students, he told them to take to the spinning wheel.   Mohamed Ali. speaking to the students, declared that if they failed to adhere to the movement, India would get swaraj by aid of the agriculturists.Section 6.   Bihar and Orissa. In recent weekly telegrams we have drawn attention to increased vigour in the non-co-operative movement, but the latest news-from the commissioner of the Tirhat division, chiefly concerned, shows a distinct change for the better.   A very welcome fall of rain improved agricultural prospects, and sent the raiyats to their fields:   In the-Bhagalpur division, on the either hand, the situation has not improved.   The movement appears to be spreading in two-districts, and the temperance movement, referred to in previous reports, is in full swing.   The latter has been characterized by a certain amount of intimidation and picketing of the liquor shops.   There is new excitement in the educational centres of Bihar and Orissa.   At the request of the Minister of Education, instructions had been issued to the district magistrates that when intimidation or other unlawful means of discouraging students are attempted, police protection should be given,, if asked for by the responsible educational authority.   It has already been reported from Muzaffafpur that an improvement is noticeable as the result of the action taken.. Attempts are being made to stir up disaffection among the tlafadars and chaukiclars. A Bihar provincial league has been formed under the auspices of flassani Imam,, which will provide the means whereby many persons hitherto inclined to extreme views in politics, but definitely opposed to non-co-operation, may give utterance to-their opinions.   Babu Dip Narayan of Bhagalpur visited the coalfields, and announced that non-co-operative and labour associations would be formed.   11 is thought that the development foreshadowed in the Nagpur congress resolution is on the eve of fulfilment, and that labour will be exploited for political ends.    At the moment,. however, the situation seems to be quiet.Section 7.   Assam. Students caught the strike contagion from Calcutta, but there has been no forcible obstruction to boys wishing to attend school, or any other-breach of the peace.   The feeling about the caliphate question is very strong in the , Surma Valley, and mohamedan officers on tour are frequently asked to resign.North-West Frontier Provinces.-There have been no  developments in the-political situation. Several agents of swadeshi goods from down country have been noticed in Peshawar, but they met with very little success in procuring orders, iSeveral mullahs in the Mahsud country have been definitely preaching non-co-operation, and dissuading the tribesmen from taking Government contracts and from supplying -Government troops.   Jan Muhammad Junejo, who headed the Sind muhajarin, arrived in Peshawar en route for Afghanistan, with the&apos; ostensible purpose of taking relief&apos; to the destitute Indian muhajarin.   All will not be allowed to cross the frontier.   Syed &apos; Ilabib Gul, editor of the Siasat, who delivered inflammatory speeches at Dera Ismail. Khan, has been removed across the Indus as he was intending to proceed to Banntu.
Lala Lajpat Rai lias also been excluded under the Defence of India Rules. Informa-tion bad been received that he was to address a large meeting at Peshawar, and, in view of a Hindu and Sikh quarrel being inevitable, the excitement would be dangerous to public&apos;safety : so notice under the ride was sent. Lajpat Rai apparently did not attempt to cross the Indus : should he do so, he will, be stopped.Delhi. Owing to the enforcement of the Seditious Meetings Act,, a large number of Delhi citizens on the 9th held a meeting at Chaziabad, United Provinces, under the presidency of Dr. Aiisari. Resolutions were passed declaring that the new legislatures did not represent the people in any way, repudiating the Delhi municipal address, reaffirming the non-co-operation resolution ; and approving villaging organizations and the enlistment of volunteers for the swaraj propaganda as propounded by the congress Gandhi arrived at Delhi on the 12th, and is reported to be likely to open the Arya Vedic institute on the 14th.Punjab. As a result of serious rioting between the Sikhs in the Golden Temple, Tarn Taran, Anlritsar, some &quot;24 people received injuries, one being killed. The case has been registered under section 140 Indian Penal Code. In view of the recent troubles connected with some of the Sikh shrines the Punjab Government decided to move the Legislative Council to appoint a committee to examine the question generally and to propose state legislation. ,Section 8. Conditions in the central Sikh districts continue to cause anxiety. Gandhi is about to visit Lahore and Amritsar according to the latest information.Section 9. General.--The following are the main comments of the leading Indian papers on the Diike&apos;s personal appeal in inaugurating the Indian legislature. Leader : Speech, though not startling was inspired with the spirit of goodwill. Amrita Bazar Pacrlka: Royal message is barren and is not capable of soothing the lacerated heart of India. Tribune : British statesmanship has lost an opportunity of conciliating India through the mouth of royalty which will be recorded by history as among its greatest blunders. The vernacular press of Bombay expressed disappointment at the Duke&apos;s speech and the King&apos;s message, which, they say, have utterly failed to produce any pacifying influence. English-owned and moderate India-owned, papers comment very favourably on the speech. The general effect of the personal appeal on those who heard it has already been reported.Secti.ni 10. How deep this feeling has penetrated will be tested on the 15th, when we shall debate on the question in the Legislative Assembly.The general situation is as reported in the concluding portion of last week&apos;s telegram. Replies are beginning to come in from the local governments to the letter which was summarized in the telegram of 29th January, and on. receipt of these we shall review the whole position and formulate the measures !o be taken.II. (24th February). Section. 1. Bombay. The student situation has improved in the whole presidency, a reaction having set in. Many students are returning. Chotani has asked the leading nationalists to advise him before his departure for England; There will probably be a further intensive campaign to strengthen him. at the allied conference. The debate on the Punjab disorders, in the Legislative Assembly, following on the appeal of the Duke, has had a good effect. His Royal Highness had a great reception in Bombay, though hartal had been oiganized previously. One market decided to close, and 300 private chauffeurs arranged to strike. The Bombay, Baroda and Central India railway workmen are still on strike. The dockers and labourers of the port trust railways are showing signs of restlessness.Section 2. At a mass meeting the tramway workers passed a resolution declaring that, in order to obtain recognition of the duly constituted union, the men, if necessary, would declare a general strike.Section 3. Bengal. The situation in the schools and colleges has not materially altered, but is showing signs of improvement in the Dacca division, where a majority of the institutions have re-opened, and are being fairly well attended. According to the press, the improvement has extended to Calcutta. The attendance at the few national schools established is poor. A significant development is an organization styled &quot; Bangya Swaraj Sevak Sangha,&quot; in which student volunteers are gathering round a. nucleus of ex-detenus. The non-co-operation movement is largely engaged in arguing its case and in discussions of the campaign. Meetings of the working -committees of the All-India congress committee were held the first week in February,
. when supervising and organizing members were appointed for each province. The staff of the schools and colleges opened, as national schools were directed to follow the,new curriculum, and to aim at its full enforcement by the end of the current year: meanwhile to confine attention to handspinning and the cottage manufacture of yarns: to teaching Hindustani through the Devanagri and Urdu scripts ; and to training-students in the arts requisite for the efficient discharge of tbe work of village organization. Gandhi&apos;s power with the illiterate classes is increasing aud illustrated, by rumours that tbe fall in the price of ghee and cloth is due to his action. Bodies of strikers visited Calcutta, paid him a rupee each and promised to touch no wme again during their lifetime. A. deputation of reserve constables were told by him they were servants of the public, whom they should not inconvenience, and should weigh everything in the balance before they decided to give up service.Section. 4. In the course of the strike, the strikers attacked trams driven by Anglo-Indians leaving the Ivalighat depot on. the 18th, and. tried to rush the depot; a police force, under the deputy commissioner, proceeded to their protection. Rushed by the mob, the sergeants, tinder orders, fired revolvers in the air. A prison van being sent with reinforcements was attacked, and the colour-sergeant in charge is alleged to have fired his revolver, killing one man and wounding three. A. magisterial enquiry is being made.United Provinces. No further disturbances in Rae Bareilly and Fyzabad. Four more agitators have been arrested under sections 124a. and 153a ; in three cases for seditious speeches, and in the fourth case for speeches attempting to seduce the police from duty. As to the strike on the Oudb and Rohilkund railway reported last -week, the latest news is, that the running stall have nearly all returned to work and a considerable number of men to the locomotive shops. The office staff has also returned. The situation is well in hand, though the strike cannot yet be said, to have failed.Section 5. It lias been decided that the magistrates in the remaining seven &quot;districts of Otidh shall prohibit meetings under section Pi of the Code of Criminal &apos; Procedure. They will exercise full discretion in allowing special meetings. A mixed column of all arms is marching through Fyzabad and Sultanpur in order to show the flag. The itinerary provides for a inarch of about 10 days. The position in Fyzabad is somewhat peculiar. No reports of crime are being made in pursuance of the present policy of the Kisam Sabhas to decide all. disputes, by panchayats. Few cases have been instituted in the civil courts. Unrest among the students is prominent in Luckuow and Benares, and coutinues elsewhere. Signs are.reported of a welcome activity in opposition to the prevailing agitation. In the Budaun district the local zamindars organized an opposition meeting against a large meeting at which prominent nationalist leaders were expected, which completely swamped the nationalists&apos; meeting. The commissioner reports that the local zamindars handled the situation well. The com-missioner of Benares writes that the position is better, and that the tone of the people is one of effort by the people to do something for themselves rather than against the Government.Central. Provinces. The non-co-operation, agitation shows no signs of abatement: the poison is spreading to the large villages. Owing to the knowledge that the local Government has decided on the policy of prosecution of the more violent speakers, the tone of the speeches lias been more restrained, but the same gospel of non-no-operation is preached. The more sober-minded section of the people recognize the seriousness of the situation. Some cases have occurred of difficulty in Government servants obtaining supplies on tour and a social boycott continues to be practised. Great activity is shown in tbe attacks on the colleges and schools. The movement is gradually spreading throughout the province, and though the attendance at the high schools varies from 50 to 84 per cent., it is slowly decreasing. About 33 lawyers have withdrawn from practice in order to devote themselves to the cause of non-co-operation .Section 6. Under section 124a, Dr. M. It. Cholkar, a private medical, practitioner and vice-president of the Nagpur municipality, been arrested to-day. He was produced before the district magistrate, and taken to the central jail amidst shouts of &quot; Bande-mataram.&quot;   The case will be heard on 3rd March.Section 7. Punjab. There has been no marked development in non-co-operation. Owing to the operation of the Seditious Meetings Act, meetings are only possible in certain districts, but these are dangerous because they may result in the creation
of disaffection in the minds of persons who came in contact with the propaganda for the first time. Non-co-operative panchayats are set up in different villages with the object of boycotting the executive authority. Students and hired preachers have been sent from Lahore to further the non-co-operation movement. It is expected they will be employed next to incite the zamindars to refuse payment of the land revenue. On die other hand, the commissioner at Lahore reports that he met some of the students who had attended the Gujranwalla meetings, and that none of them thought that he was obliged to stir up the people not to pay land revenue, Lajpat Rai is reported to be organizing meetings and to be arranging for funds. The pleader class clo not support the non-co-operation movement whole-heartedly by giving up legal practice, and there is a good deal of disgust among the leaders. Sarclar Sardal Singh, president of the district Sikh league and secretary of the provincial eongress:committee, has been served with an order under section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure, not to leave the limits of the Lahore municipality. As regards the Akhali Dal movement to take possession of the Sikh shrines, it had been proposed to hold a preliminary conference of Neo-Sikhs and of the Mdhants aud Pujaris in possession of the shrines, with the object of settling upon the points in dispute. Since then, however, the affair at Nankana Sahib has occurred, and it is possible that this may necessitate the abandonment of this proposal and the adoption of other measures.SectionS. Delhi. The outstanding event has been the Royal visit. The functions, passed off successfully, and the effect of the visit has been good with the better classes of the population and the troops collected in Delhi for the occasion. There were no untoward incidents and no obstruction was attempted. The attendance of the general public on the routes was meagre, but it must be remembered that the processions arranged did not lend themselves to great spectacular displays. Hartal was advertized for the 9th February, but it was a half-hearted affair as far as the shopkeepers were concerned, People could buy what they wanted at the side doors. The partial hartal of the 14th affected no one. Gandhi opened the Tibbia college on the 13th. The ceremony included unveiling portraits of Lord and Lady Hardinge. Gandhis address carefully avoided politics.Section 9. The schools and colleges in Delhi appear so far to have been singularly little affected by the intensive propaganda in. other large cities.North-West Frontier Province. There has been a partial recrudescence of political agitation. Lajpat Rai&apos;s&apos; visit to Rawalpindi,&apos; and his promise to extend the tour to Peshawar, were signals for political meetings in Peshawar. His exclusion from the province disappointed the local agitators, and meetings of protest were held, It has been decided to form provincial congress committees, and district committees are already established in Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan. Meetings have been held to advocate non-co-operation, and an appeal has been made to the schools.Burma. There are.signs of increasing cleavage between the two parties in the YoungMen&apos;s Buddhist Association. In a debate in the Legislative Council one member assured the Government of co-operation if diarchy on liberal lines was adopted; on the-other hand, two priests and various laymen are touring the country and delivering violent speeches. The prosecution of one priest has beeu sanctioned. The educational boycott remains about the same. There are no signs of financial support in cash to the national schools movement, and the teachers in one of the national schools are on strike because they cannot get their pay.Madras. Leaders of the non-co-operation movement have redoubled their efforts to win recruits for the organization known as the swarji volunteer corps, started by the local caliphate committee for propaganda&apos; work ; but only 25 have joined up to the present. The campaign amongst the students was pressed, but the results are incommensurate with the.activities displayed. In Mof ussil, the efforts of the leaders met with little success, except in Malabar. Attempts made to secure Mopillas caused . some concern, and the local leaders called in Yakub Hassan and others.Section 10. The district magistrate of Calicut issued orders prohibiting caliphate meetings, and arrested Yakiib Hassan and three others, who were ordered to execute security of Rs. 1,000 each, and on refusing to execute the bonds, were sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment. There was hartal in the city of Madras, but the local Government reports that, though the incidents caused some local excitement, the situation is well in hand, and that the shops are now opened. Business is proceeding as usual. A motion was raised in the Legislative Council, but talked out without a 20-1 C
division, the sense of the House strongly supporting the action of the district magistrate. The presidency caliphate committee resolved that arrangements&apos; should he made for complete hartal throughout the presidency, to express the resentment of the people at the action of the district magistrate at Calicut. The chairman of the Calicut munici-pality resigned as a protest. Yakub Hassan has had a statement published in Hindu to the effect that the district.magistrate^ order was disobeyed, so as to linpress on the people the non-violent character of the non-co-operation programme. If 20,000&apos;people had assembled at the meeting and gone back disappointed they would have carried disaffection far wider. A. vakils&apos; meeting in Mahajana Sabha resolved to start arbitration courts, from 1st March. In Bihar a number of constables resigned in Patna ancl Gaya. It was understood to be. clue to the efforts of agitators, and the constables were interviewed and asked to withdraw their resignations, as they did not understand the position. At Gaya all the. constables who had. resigned, except 37, -withdrew their resignations and resumed duty. There has been, no move-men t whatever amongst the constables of Patna, who realize that the Gaya movement has failed. The situation in this respect lias much improved, A renewed attack upon schools and colleges has not met with much success, and most of the students who left have returned. A press message states the district magistrate at Arrah served a notice on Mazarul llaque ancl Rajendra Prasad forbidding them to enter the . proscribed limits of the town under section 144, Criminal Procedure Code.. Assam. The school, campaign had but little real success. A large caliphate meeting, presided over by Chanda, fell rather flat.Section 1L General.  On the whole there are some signs of improvement. The attack on educational institutions has apparently suffered a check. Gandhi appears to be realizing the danger of tampering with the masses, and has written an article .in which he declares that it is dangerous to make political use of factory-labourers: or peasantry. How far his advice on this point will be accepted by his followers remains to be seen ; but the fact that he is not inclined to lend Ins assistance to agitators who are endeavouring to stir up the masses, undoubtedly reduces the danger of this side of the non-co-operation movement securing any great measure of success. At the same time, the situation in this country is liable, to change with great rapidity, and it would be unwise to base any confident inferences on what may prove to be a merely temporary improvement. Our relations with the Indian legislature are at present excellent, and this is having a distinct effect on the country.The Sevres Treaty. On 23rd February the Viceroy sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for India: In the course of the discussion in the Council of State on the 21st, on a motion to adjourn the house to discuss Indian moslem representation at the inter-allied conference now sitting, the home member undertook to cable to you the views of the moslem members of the Indian legislature. The following are the representations which they have asked to be telegraphed : &quot; (1) Turkish independence and autonomy should be made a reality.   It shouldnot remain a fiction as it is at present under the treaty of Sevres. &quot; (2) Thrace, Adriauople,. Smyrna, and such other parts of Asia Minor as are predominantly Turkish in race, should be given back to Turkey, subject to the protection of the minorities in those provinces. &quot;(3) All Arab provinces should be given complete autonomy without any direct or indirect control or interference of any non-moslem Power.    They should be left alone to themselves as the Mussalmans of India consider it contrary to the last will and inj unction of the Holy Prophet that any non-moslem Power should exercise  any control or  authority over  these ,:;       provinces.(4) All the holy places of the Mussalmans should be placed under the suzerainty, if not the rule, of the Sultan of Turkey, the Khalifa of the Mussalmans.&quot; Our own impression is that these demands ask for more than would. probably meet the expectations of the moderate element in the mohamedan population, and&apos; we are confirmed in this view by BhurgrPs speech in opening the debate.   It is true that he also asked that full autonomy should be granted to the Arab provinces by setting up Arab Governments there, but the impression which the debate has left onus is that the grant of demand. No. 2, and of some suzerainty (Bhurgri himself , used the words &quot;suzerainty, however, nominal&quot;) of the Sultan over Mecca ancl Medina would go far to allay the resentment now felt by moderate Mohamedans.
Meeting of Prime Ministers next June.  On 20th February Mr. Churchill telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa and to the Governor of Newfoundland, informing them that His Majesty&apos;s Government had had under examination the cpiestion of the agenda, and that it appeared to them that the following subjects were of first importance : (1) The renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance.i&apos;2) Naval, military and air defence.(3) Arrangements for securing a common imperial policy in foreign affairs. (4) The composition, meeting place, and agenda of the constitutional conference contemplated in resolution 9 of the Imperial War Conference of 1917.As in the case of the sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet in 19.17 and 1918, it was also proposed that the opening meetings should include statements as to the general position on the main issues of foreign and imperial policy by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and other Ministers concerned.The question of inter-imperial communications by laud and sea had been proposed by Australia and &quot; the position of British Indians in other parts of the Empire &quot; by India, in addition to the above subjects. He himself had suggested the inclusion in the former of communications by air.-Other matters which would or might require discussion were:  (a) The recommendations of the oversea settlement conference recently held in London.(h) The development of civil aviation ;(c) The reports of the imperial shipping committee appointed as a result of resolutions 11 and 24- of the Imperial War Conference, 1918 ;(rf) The findings of the technical commission appointed in connexion with the imperial wireless scheme-see my telegram of 21st. January 1921 [B.E.R., xxxvii, p. 7];(e) Reparation (division of any amount received between various parts of BritishEmpire in particular); (/) An imperial statistical bureau ; (g) Imperial patents.If your Prime Minister has any subjects not included in the above list to suggest we should be grateful if he would telegraph them, and also furnish, as soon as possible, explanatory memoranda.Memoranda on all the questions named above, except those proposed by Australia and India, are being prepared here and they will be despatched as soon ns ready.It is suggested that as questions of defence and civil aviation both seem likely to need a good deal of detailed examination with departments here, any expert advisers on these subjects required by your Prime Minister should reach the United Kingdom, if possible, three weeks before the commencement of the actual meetings.Conference on Electrical Communications [B.E.R., xxxvii, p. 7]. On 18th February the Governor-General of New Zealand replied to the telegram sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 21st January, saying : My Government is satisfied as to the competence of the wireless commission to allot wave-lengths. Our present requirements above 5,000 metres are nil, as regular long-distance communications from Awanui, New Zealand, to Apia and Rarotonga are carried out on 2,000 to 3,500 metres, and irregular emergency communication with Fiji and Sydney is carried out over same range of wave-lengths. New Zealand telefunken stations at Awanui and Awarua are hot equipped for transmission above 3,500 metres. In the event of such wave-lengths becoming forbidden by an inter-national telegraphic convention, suitable wave-lengths should be reserved for New Zealand in order to enable the above-mentioned services to be maintained efficiently. Further, in the event of these stations being modernized with valve transmitters, similar action will be necessary. In the meantime, no other long-distance service is contemplated.

The assets here are vested in the central wool committee appointed by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia under war precaution wool and sheepskins regulations. The Prime Minister has received from the association an undertaking to carry out the assurances contained in my telegram of 7th January, and asks that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia be authorized to direct the -central wool committee (a) to transfer to the Wool Realization Association such assets in the Commonwealth as belong to the Australian wool growers, and (6) also transfer to the Wool Realization Association such assets in the Commonwealth&apos; as belong to the British Government, to he dealt with by the Wool Realization Association as agent for your Government arid as directed by you pending the settlement of agency terms. It is also desired that the transfer in like manner of Australian assets in England and elsewhere than in Australia to the association through the British board be authorized and directed. A power of attorney in favour of the British board of the association, authorizing them to receive and take over such assets, has been forwarded by the association to the British board in London.Pacific Islands [B.E.R., i, p. 3]. On 28th February the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State as follows: Pursuant to article 1 of the Nauru Island agreement, the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia has appointed Brigadier-General Thomas Griffiths, C.M.G., C.B.E., D,S.O., to be administrator of Nauru for five years from 16th February 1921. It is expected that Brigadier-General Griffiths wall arrive at Nauru towards the end of April. Brigadier-General Griffiths was formerly commandant of the Australian Imperial Force headquarters, London, and since last April has been acting as administrator of the New Guinea territory.NEW ZEALAND.Meat [B.E.R., xxxv, p. 13].-The following telegram, was sent by the Governor-General to. the Secretary of State on 27th February: A very serious position has developed in New Zealand consequent on the fact that offers to purchase frozen beef and mutton by overseas buyers are either non-existent or based on so low a figure that, after paying charges together with freight to tbe United Kingdom, practically little or no return will accrue to the producer. One most important matter in this connexion lies in the high freight rate charged
by the tonnage committee for shipping space controlled by His Majesty&apos;s Government,, ---and representations, which have been made already through the High Commissioner for New Zealand, have not secured the concessions which are absolutely necessary in order to save a collapse of the market here in respect - of beef and mutton in particular. A further cable has been sent by the Prime Minister to the High Commissioner, but it is desired to supplement this by placing the position before you, and it is earnestly requested that you will give this matter your most careful attention, as not only is the producer suffering heavy tosses, but the finances of the Dominion generally must be most seriously affected unless adequate relief is afforded. Such relief could be given by a material reduction in freight rates on refrigerated shipping space, which are at present on an extremely high basis, in spite of the fact that freight rates on general cargo space throughout the world generally have fallen, heavily, and, further, it is understood that the cost of bunker coal, which was previously instanced as one important factor which rendered high freight rates neces-sary, has fallen considerably. An additional disability, which is having far-reaching effects, lies in the totally inadequate quantity of refrigerated shipping which is allocated to the New Zealand trade for the present and immediately succeeding months. Consequent on this shortage of shipping, much of the frozen meat already produced, has missed the best market, and, moreover, British buyers, largely as the result of uncertainty as to time of delivery, are entirely refraining from making any forward purchases, thus seriously embarrassing producers and freezing companies through their inability to realize on stocks already in store, and. through having to finance these stocks without any certainty of when they can be realized. This again is operating detrimentally to dominion finance as a whole, which is now in a position requiring most careful handling. It is earnestly requested that you will take such -steps as will afford the relief, which is daily becoming more absolutely necessary, in -order to avoid a most serious financial position in the Dominion.SOUTH AFRICA.Wool. This telegram from the Governor-General of South Africa was received, &quot;by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 1st March : My Ministers wish to express their warm appreciation of the offer which His Majesty&apos;s Government has made to purchase the 1919-1920 wool clip. They are glad to accept the offer and agree to all the conditions stated in your telegram of the 19th January.There are between 50,000 and 60,000 bales still unsold in the Union of last -season&apos;s wool. This includes approximately 5,000 bales of scoured wool. It has not, however, been possible to ascertain what proportion of the above total quantity is likely to be offered, although it is thought by the wool trade at the various ports that there is every prospect of the whole quantity becoming available.On receipt of a reply to this telegram it is proposed to request holders of last season&apos;s wool to register their clips within a given period if they are willing to accept the offer.It is suggested that the offer shall include all scoured wools of the 1919-1920 -season, and that they be purchased on the 1918-19.1.4 schedule of clean-scoured prices, plus a reasonable charge for scouring, with clue allowance of, say, up to id. per pound for deficiency in scouring, and that clean-scoured prices for coarse and coloured wools be fixed at two and a half times those for coarse and coloured in the grease.The wool trade here wishes to know what period is meant by 1919-1920 season, .and whether unsold wools shipped to the United Kingdom are included in the offer. Arrangements would, have to be made in London for the appraisement of such wools if they are included.My Ministers agree that the organization for the valuing and paying of the wool -and for carrying out the scheme generally shall be the same as that adopted for 1917;but, with&apos; a view to economy, they recommend that, instead of having a central -committee of five members, only one officer, assisted by a small advisory committee at -each port and such staff as may be required, be appointed by the Union Governmentto control and manage the scheme. They recommend that this officer should be paid at the rate of 1,2001. per annum, which was the salary paid during the last scheme to -each member of the central committee.My Ministers wish to know whether His J\Jajesty&apos;s Government desire that theDirector of haw Materials should confirm the appointment of the appraisers.   They
also wish to know whether the wool purchase should be insured. Wools purchased! Under the last scheme were not insured.In view of the re-imposition of the tariff on wool by the United States and the-failure of the negotiations with the Germans, unless some outlet can be found for this. Season&apos;s wool, it is feared that the state of the South African wool market, which is. already critical, will become infinitely worse and bring about a financial crisis.The difficulties with which His Majesty&apos;s Government are faced are fully realized by my Ministers, who naturally feel somewhat diffident to make any proposals which are likely to add thereto, but any assistance which His Majesty&apos;s Government could give in any way towards finding an outlet for this season&apos;s wool would be greatly appreciated and would help to solve the financial stringency which confronts the-Union Government.Further, my Ministers fear that the mohair industry will cease to exist unless an outlet can soon be found for the mohair. The plight of the growers is even worse-than that of the sheep farmers. They have three years&apos; mohair on hand, and positively no market or prospects, and my Ministers enquire whether it would not be possible for mohair to be included in His Majesty&apos;s Governments offer for last season&apos;s wool.-My Ministers state that they would be grateful if they could have an early reply to this telegram.Senate Elections. On &apos;24th February ReuteFs agent at Capetown telegraphed the following final results in the elections to the Senate, apart from the eight members, already nominated : -South African Party -        -        -         -        -   17 . Nationalists   -        -        -        -         -        -   13, Labour        - -        -        -        -        -    mr. N. J. de Wet, the Minister of Justice, who was defeated in the Legislative Assembly elections, becomes senator for the Transvaal, while Mr. F. W. Reitz, Ex-President of the Orange Free State and President of the late Union Senate, who-Was not re-nominated for the Orange Free State owing to political exigencies, has been elected for the Transvaal.In another telegram he pointed out that an interesting feature of the Senate-elections was that the South African party had gained an additional seat in the Cape-province through labour voting in their favour. It was considered most probable-that the .South African party would secure 25 seats, which would give them a majority of 10.- General Smuts&apos; Majority. In a letter from an official of the South Africa branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, it was stated that General Smuts&quot; majority was certainly a surprise to many, although it was remarkable how close the-result was to the estimate formed by General Smuts himself.
