ADEN.Colonel Jacob&apos;s Mission-On 18th December Lord Allenby transmitted [No. 1725] a telegram from, the Resident at Aden reporting that Colonel Jacob&apos;s Mission had reached that place, all well. The Resident went on to say that. Major Meek had shown ability, firmness and .tact in very trying circumstances, and he hoped that his services would receive recognition ; in which Lord AUenby said that he concurred.The Imam and Bhala-On 10th December the Resident reported [No. 268 A.P.] that the Imam claimed suzerainty over Dhala and the whole of Yemen and that he had sent men to establish order. This information was contained in a letter from the Imam, to which the Resident proposed to reply that Dhala was in our protectorate in accordance with the line settled with the Turkish Government, that we could recognize no other influence -within the boundary, and &quot;must therefore request him to withdraw immediately.EGYPT.Al Azhar and Independence:-On 18th December Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 1727] as follows :-The jReqtor of Al Azhar, the U-lenia, and the members of the High Council of At Azhar addressed a letter to me which contains&apos;. the following sentences: (1) The Egyptian nation has agreed to uphold (? accepting complete indepen-dence, which is a legitimate claim, and has insisted upon continuing to claim it by all fair means, but the British Government does not show any inclination to acknowledge this claim.(2) The undersigned Ulemas of Al Azhar and members of its High Council find that the only way for peace (? and) coming to good terms, and for (? the mutual) advantage of either side is that the British Government should fulfil their promises and announce the complete independence of this country.An identic letter has been sent to the Sultan and the Prime Minister, and has also been published in the Press. I saw the Sultan yesterday and, after consultation with the Prime Minister, His Highness has to-day seen the religious heads of Al Azhar and admonished them in the following sense :  Their part is to give instruction, above all in religious matters, and therefore they should not intervene in political questions or anything which could disturb the public peace. - His Highness disapproves of the course which they have adopted of late.Trouble with Students. On 12th December Lord Allenby reported [No. 1702] as follows : Yesterday, owing to a small demonstration of students, molesting some native merchants near Al Azhar University who refused to close their shops, 25 British troops were sent to assist the police. They were stoned on arrival, and the students retreated within Al Azhar and stoned the soldiers from inside. A few soldiers entered A.z Azhar, but were soon recalled. Except for the entry of the soldiers into Al. Azhar, the incident is unimportant, but it is possible some attempt, may be made to exploit it politically.SUDAN.Trouble with the Aliab Tribe. On 15th December Lord Allenby transmitted [No. 1714] the following report received from the Sirdar :-1 deeply regret to (? inform you that) Major C. H. (?) Stigand, West Kent Regiment, and Major R. F. White, Essex Regiment, were killed during an attack by the Aliab Sheikh Dinkas on patrol in the Mongolia Province, west of the Nile, near Tom.be, latitude 5&apos; 50&quot; N., longitude 31&apos; 45&quot; E.On 30th October, for reasons not yet definitely ascertained, the Aliab suddenly (? attacltjed the police post which was established last year to commence adminis-tration in this district.   After repulsing the attack (? post) retired on the river with
INDIA.Telegraphing on 3rd and 10th December the Viceroy reported as follows :  The Hunter Committee. The evidence in regard to the Lahore disturbances hasbeen concluded, and wild comments on General Dyer&apos;s evidence have been made in .the extremist Press.Peace Celebrations. The opponents of the peace celebrations have established a Publicity Board for rousing public opinion against any celebrations, and the move-ment is gaining strength; its promoters, however, publicly deprecate either inter-ference with those who may participate or violence of any kind.Tilali. The order of externment made against Tilak by the Punjab Government has been cancelled. He is reported to have spoken as follows at a dinner of welcome in Bombay : Indians could get justice neither in England nor in India; judges in both countries looking not to justice but to expediency when questions between English-men aud Indians were concerned. Indians would only be able to get justice when they had in their hands the power of extorting it. As to reforms it was the spirit of the times, not any political party, that was favourable to them. The Secretary of State&apos;s aim was to give as little as possible while advertising widely that he was a great reformer. Refoms were given to India in pursuance of the game of politics and for self-advertisement, not as a matter of right and justice.Strike at Gawnpbre. There has been a general strike in the Cawnpore mills. The men at first refused to go back pending the Lieutenant-Governofs visit as they 6-4 A 2a loss of one killed. Nine other police and three telegraph linesmen on duty in the district have also been killed. One company of Equatorials was sent immediately to reconnoitre. They reported that apparently the whole of the Aliab tribe were involved, also.that the Northern Mandri, tribe had joined the Aliab, and that other Dinkas were restless and waiting to join if the Government showed any sign of weakness or delay ; also that the country was difficult to move in owing to long grass and the khors being full. Major White, commanding the Equatorial (? battalion), was sent with a second company to carry on a more thorough reconnaissance. This column found villages (groups omitted) (? Zariba) in considerable force (? :) they were repulsed after hand-to-hand lighting. (? Our) losses were seven other ranks killed and nine wounded ; enemy lost heavily. A further (? half) company accompanied by Major Stigand, (? Governor) of the Province, as Political Officer, having landed further north, joined Major White (. ?) This force then proceeded to clear up the country and to try and get into touch with the enemy. Owing to an interruption in telegraph lines no information as to movements of force was received till the 13th (? when) a mutilated telegram arrived reporting that on 8th December the enemy, numbering about 1,000, had rushed the advance guard column, which was marching in open square through thick grass 7 feet high, and had driven it back into the square, where hand-to-hand (? fighting) took place in which the two British officers already mentioned, one Sudanese officer, 22 other ranks, and three carriers were killed, and 18 other ranks and 10 carriers wounded. The attack was repulsed in a quarter of an hour and the column withdrew slowly to Tombe, five days&apos; march, with all baggage and wounded.A considerable number of the enemy followed the column for four days, attempting to make a night attack on the night of 8th December, which was driven off, but not otherwise interfering with march.The senior officer left with column considers that the attack of 8th December was (group undecypherable) (? of this) offensive as the column was approaching cattle enclosures,I am reinforcing the posts on the river and others to the west of the Aliab country, but must await further information before deciding on punitive measures, which will probably have to be postponed until the end of January, when the grass will be sufficiently dry for burning and the country more free of water.
hoped that he would intervene, whilst the employers refused to negotiate unless the employees returned to work, but eventually the workmen returned unconditionally.Economic Conditions. On 12th December the Viceroy reported that famine operations had been closed in the Deoghar, Bhagalpur, Sadat; and Banka sub-divisions, in Bihar and Orissa, and in Goomsoor Taluka, and on the Kalikota and Atagada estates of the Ganjam district in the Madras Presidency.Numbers relieved: Burma: works, 2,700; gratuitous, 100. Bihar and Orissa : gratuitous, 450. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 89; gratuitous, 14. Hyderabad : works, 8,000; gratuitous, 0,000.   Madras: works, 502 ; gratuitous, 2,277.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Est.dblishm.Genl of High-power Radio Station. On 20th December the Governor-General telegraphed as follows : My Ministers represent that this matte)- is one of great interest to the Department of Naval Service in that there is at the present moment considerable agitation for the establishment of a high-power radio station on the Pacific coast to provide communication, with the Orient, owing to delays on cables. Several months ago the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada, Limited, fded an application with that Department for a licence to install and operate a medium power station in British Columbia to communicate with the San Francisco station of the trans-Pacific chain of their affiliated American Company. This application was refused by the Department of Naval Service on (he ground that it merely provided a duplication of existing telegraph routes to San. Francisco, and would in. no way assist in relieving the cable congestion to the. Orient. The Company now advise that they propose to file, in the immediate future, an application for a licence to install and operate a trans-Pacific station to ; work directly with the corresponding station in Japan and it is understood that they are in negotiation with the Government of Japan with a view to obtaining a licence for the latter station or, failing this, a working arrange-ment under which the Govern men t ol: Japan station will, handle their traffic. The matter of the establishment of a high-power station on the Pacific cost for naval work has been before the Department of Naval Service for several years, and the need for the same is apparent. The expense, however, of establishing and operating such a station is considerable, and unless the station can be used for commercial purposes and sufficient revenue messages were in sight to pay the major portion of the operating expenses, it would be difficult to justify the necessary expenditure. The Department of Naval Service accordingly await with interest the report of the Committee; in the meantime they will be glad to know if you are of opinion that the Department should refrain from taking action in the matter of granting a licence to the Marconi Company pending the receipt of the Oommittee&apos;s recommendations.Sir Robert Borden. On 18th December the Director of Information at Ottawa telegraphed saying that the announcement of the early retirement of Sir Robert Borden from the Premiership of Canada on account of ill-health came as a shock to the country, although it was known in inside circles that he was feeling the effects of the heavy burdens of the last five years. The Press throughout the Dominion, irrespective of party allegiance, pays a high tribute to the character and public services of Sir Robert Borden and regrets that he finds it necessary to abandon his office. [According to the Press, Sir Robert Borden has since consented to remain in office.]The Proposed Tariff Inquiry. The Diiector of Information also reported that Sir Henry Dray Ion, K.C., Minister of Finance, had announced that, owing to the continuance of &quot;unsettled conditions, the Tariff inquiry, which it had been, the Government^ intention to hold before the next session of Parliament, would be deferred.
AUSTRALIA.Wool. On 18th December the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, transmitting the following message from his Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes: -The attention of the Commonwealth Government ha.s been directed again to the question of the price of Australian wool. The manner in which the price of A ustrahan wool is and has been fixed is highly prejudicial to the Australian wool grower and the -Commonwealth generally. Under the agreement between the British Government and the Common-wealth Government, theCommonwealth Government is entitled to half profits on all wools sold for civilian purposes. As you know, the price at which Australian wool is sold in much less than the true market value. Auction sales prove this quite clearly. It follows from this that your Government, in selling our wool&apos;at less than its value, is depriving and has deprived us of millions of money to which \\ e are entitled under the agreement. The Commonwealth Government emphatically protests against a course which puts millions into the pockets&apos; of the British manufacturer at the expense of the Australian wool grower, and requests (1) either that all sales shall be made by free open auction, or (2) alternatively that we shall be consulted as to the issue price. The British Government has no right whatever to sell our wool for less than its market value when under the agreement we are entitled to half profits over Is. o^A May we venture to urge upon you at once the importance and urgency of this matter, and ask you to be good enough to let me have a reply at the very earliest convenience.SOUTH AFRICA.Strike in Gape Town. On 20th December the Governor-General of South Africa telegraphed as follows: Yosterday I was visited by General Smuts, who came in regard to the situation at Cape Town, which is serious. All the coloured workmen and dock hands are out on strike and, since they refuse to handle foodstuffs while the cost of living remains so high, the shipping is held up.It is hard to say how the strike may develop. The Cape Town poliqe authorities expect that serious disturbances may take place with which it may not be possible for them to cope. They are anxious to be able to rely on military assistance if necessary.In order to avoid any intervention of the Imperial authorities in a matter which is purely one of law and order in the Union of South Africa and not [ ? ], and seeing that the garrison battalion is entirely composed of South African troops, my Ministers have proposed, in a minute, that the battalion should be placed temporarily at the disposal and under the command of the Union District Staff Omcer in the event of its being required to help the civil authorities in the maintenance of law and order.I discussed the srxbject with the Prime Minister and, being in agreement with his views communicated with the General Officer Commanding. The General Officer Commanding now informs me that he sees no objection to the proposal as a temporary expedient, and that he has placed the battalion under the orders of the District Staff Officer, the rest of the garrison remaining under his command.The Future of south Africa. Renter&apos;s agent reported from Zeerust, on 3rd December, that General Smuts, who was visiting the West Transvaal, in the course of a speech that day, had said that undoubtedly it would not be long before the Union had its own flag, approved by all sections of the population, lie urged that capital should be utilized for development and not for wasteful military measures. &quot;The British Empire,&quot; the General added, &quot;as the strongest organization in the world, affords us protection which is the best possible insurance. South Africa ought to establish her independence materially, socially, financially, economically and industrially.&quot;Racialism.-Renter&apos;s agent telegraphed from Pretoria, on 1st December, as follows : Work on the new buildings of the Buxton Hostel for the accommodation of students attending the Transvaal University College has already begun, and will be completed in June. His Excellency the Governor-General visiting the hostel praised the work which Mr. Justice Bristowe had done for the institution, which had probably been so successful because it was neither a racial nor a denominational establishment. Unfortunately, His Excellency added, the racial question was still a serious one in South Africa, and it might occasion some slight trouble in the future, but he was
confident that the Union would increase in prosperity and eventually become a happy and contented land.Nationaluts and Separatism. The following message was sent by ReuteFs Cape Town agent on 29th November, but it has been delayed, in transmission:- &apos;An interesting feature of the recent political situation was the defence by General Hertzog of Bolshevism, which he defined as &quot; the desire of the people to rule them-selves and not to be ruled by others.&quot;General Smuts, in the course of a speech made in Johannesburg yesterday evening, said that, if General Hertzog defended Bolshevism, he did not know what he was doing. From what he had seen, General Smuts feared that the Nationalists were rapidly becoming a Bolshevist Party, &quot; showing a spirit of insubordination, indiscipline and defiance of all authority, which boded ill for the people of this country.&quot;In view of General Smuts&apos; assertion that the Nationalists were abandoning the Republican movement, particular interest attaches to the correspondence recently exchanged between Professor Fremantle, Vice-Chairman of the Cape Nationalist Party, and General Hertzog. The former asked General Hertzog whether, in accord-ance with the new article in the Nationalist amended programme (which laid down that the existing relationship with the Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom was recognized, but that the ultimate destiny and aim of the people of the Union must be full freedom and sovereign independence) the party is a Republican, that is to say, a separatist party, and &quot;if the people become satisfied with&apos; membership in the Empire without subordination or curtailment of their freedom, will it be inconsistent with the new article to accept the position? &quot;General Hertzog replied : &quot; There can be no doubt that the vast majority of the party is Republican, but Republicanism, as a party principle binding on every member, is no principle of the party. It is free for any member of the party to adopt an attitude of watching events, both in regard to the form of our future government and the question of membership of the Empire.&quot;New Veterinary College. Telegraphing from Pretoria on 2nd December ReuteFs agent reported that farmers throughout the Union had latterly been complaining of a serious shortage of veterinary surgeons. It was now understood that the Govern-ment intended to establish a College of Veterinary Science, the first principal of which will be Sir Arnold Theiler, a former director of the Veterinary Research Branch of the Union Department of Agriculture. The new institution would form an integral, part of the Transvaal University College.A7ata7. Elections. It is announced that at the forthcoming elections the Nationalists intend to contest every seat in Natal. The Nationalists hitherto have never been represented in this province.German Interests in the Otavi Mine and Railway Company. On 13th December the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa as follows : The Board of Trade learn that various groups, some not being British, are showing marked interest in the disposal of the German interests in the Otavi Mine and Railway Company, and it is likely that their representatives will approach your Government.The Board of Trade realize that the decision rests with the Union Government entirely, but they hope that in considering the question of the disposal of the Company&apos;s mining undertaking the Union Government will take into account the great advantage which, in view of the small production of copper ore and the still smaller amount of smelting within the Empire at present, would accrue if arrange-ments could be made to secure that the purchasers are British and that the ore production will be treated within the British Empire. It is understood that a substantial group in which British interests would exercise effective control would be prepared to take over the German interests. I should be glad to learn the views of your Ministers.
