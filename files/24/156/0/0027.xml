The first of the following paragraphs is taken from the. Report of the Ministry of Labonr for the week ending 18th September, and the other two from the Report for the following week : The Cost of Living. The joint committee to investigate the increased cost of living, appointed, last June by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-operative Union, issued an interim report on the 8th September for presentation to the Trades. Union Congress. The committee found that the high cost of living may be primarily assigned to currency expansion, and not to under-production, and that the chief remedy would therefore be to deal with the inflation of currency in this and other countries, and to deflate it, where possible, to an extent which would eliminate the depreciation of currency in terms of gold. The report maintains that such measures would involve a reduction of prices by about 20 per cent., and, at the same time, would cut at the root of the automatic rise of prices due to currency influences. On the other hand, a steady improvement of productivity, through the participation of all countries in the trade of the world, the improvement of methods ancl machinery, and a far-reaching re-organization of industry, is necessary to prevent the widespread unemployment and general fall in wages which would inevitably accompany an attempt to reduce prices by the method proposed. The. report goes on to advocate that the present index numbers of the cost of living should &quot; be superseded by new index numbers, based upon the prices prevailing since the armistice&quot;; and it details the measures which should be adopted to deal with the problem of high prices. With regard to the international aspect of the question, the view is put forward that the re-establishment of peace throughout tlie world is the first essential for a fall in prices. The report also recommends that, until the machinery of exchange is re-established, the import and export of goods between different countries should be conducted, where other methods are not possible, by means of direct barter, and that an international loan should be floated by the League of Nations to assist impoverished countries in the restoration of their productive capacity.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920 [B.E.R., xxiv, p. 2]-A special meeting of the general council of the Scottish Clerks&apos; Association was held in Glasgow on the 18th September to consider the advisability of working the Unemployment Insurance Act on behalf of business assistants. A resolution was passed unanimously agreeing to operate the State scheme.Finance Act, 1920. The special conference summoned to determine the policy of the co-operative movement in connection with the Corporation Profits Tax under the Finance Act, 1920, was held at Preston on the 15th September. The official policy, which was endorsed by the conference, amounts practically to a decision to accept the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ suggestion to submit an alternative scheme to that proposed by the Government, and, meanwhile, to use every possible means to agitate for the repeal of the tax, so far as it affects co-operative societies. Although this moderate official policy was endorsed, it is significant that an amendment, submitted by a number of societies, urging that the co-operative movement as a whole should defy the law and refuse to pay the tax, received 1,055 votes as compared with 1,912 votes in favour of the official resolution. The conference instructed their committee that the proposals put forward as alternatives must in any case provide for the exemption of all surplus arising from mutual trading, and must be approved by at east a two-thirds majority of the societies voting upon them.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.Special reuter Service. See under &quot; Dominions.&quot;EGYPT.The Zagloulist Delegation.  On 18th September Mr. Scott reported from Alexandria [No. 920] that the Zagloulist delegation had invited all the surviving members of the legislative assembly now in Egypt, except the Ministers, to a meeting
which was held on 16th September at the house of Mahmud Suleiman Pasha. Of 49 members present 45 pronounced in favour of the proposals as the basis of a treaty;-two were against, and two did not vote. Two absent members wrote expressing themselves in favour of the proposals.Similar resolutions were passed unanimously at a meeting of Ahmed (? Talaat) Pasha, president of the native, Court of Appeal, the chief of the native parquet at Alexandria, and 12 judges of the native courts; and at a large meeting of the inhabitants of Zifta and Mit Ghamrhe held under the presidency of Ismail Sidki Pasha.MESOPOTAMIA.     -Improved Situation. The Civil Commissioner in Baghdad reported on 18th September that three days previously he had visited Ramacli, and there interviewed the [or a] leading chief. He found that the insurgents had made their maximum effort, and that the situation had improved, as he believed was the case throughout Mesopotamia, Given the success of the military measures in progress, there was good reason for thinking that there would be a steady improvement and that affairs would be ripe for a settlement by the end of next month at the latest.TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.Governor Sworn in. -ReuteEs agent reported from Tanganyika on 25th September that the Order in Council recently issued relating to the Tanganyika Territory had been publicly read that morning, and that Sir Horace Byatt, K.C.M.G., had been sworn in as Governor and Commander-in-Chief. General satisfaction, he added, was felt at the. definite signs of the reopening of the territory.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xxiii, p. 4]. On, 24th September the Viceroy telegraphed [1139 S.] the receipt of a report that great excitement had been caused in Kabul by the downfall of the Amir of Bokhara, which was likely to result in the Afghan delegation being sent to India at an early date, with the object of concluding a final agreement with the British Government. In the opinion of the Indian Government, if the delegation came, they would either urge a defensive alliance with the British, or would press for immediate and considerable gifts of arms and ammunition to enable Afghanistan to resist Bolshevik pressure and demands for co-operation against the British in India. It was thought that the Afghans might make our attitude in the matter the test of our future intentions, and might declare that, while it was their desire to be friends with us, without the assistance indicated they would not be strong enough to resist the Bolshevik terms. In view of the arrival of Djemal Pasha at Herat with a considerable force of Bolsheviks and Turks, if the Afghan delegation came to India with such requests as are indicated above it would be imperative to give a prompt decision. On this account the Indian Government asked for guidance.While a regular defensive alliance, with the obligations it would carry, seemed out of the question, gifts of arms and ammunition, might well be considered. It might be. desirable to show some trust in the Afghans in their present dilemma, and it might be that a prompt gift of arms and ammunition would cause a revulsion of popular feeling in Afghanistan in our favour, and even be beneficial to Indian Moslem sentiment. Insistence on the immediate signature of the treaty of friendship, and on the conditions of co-operation as already laid down, would follow as a matter of course. The Indian Government desired an expression of opinion from the Secretary of State on these suggestions.The Viceroy&apos;&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on 18th and 26th September: I. (18th September). The resolution of the special Congress adopting non-co-operation is the absorbing topic of interest in the Press.   Now the decision has been
taken, people are beginning to reflect on what non-co-operation involves. The adoption of the resolution is everywhere recognized as a personal triumph for Gandhi and not clue to the soundness of his reasoning or the acquiescence of thoughtful politicians, whether moderate or extremist. The fallacies and dangers of non-co-operation continue to be exposed in the Press. The resolution as carried advises, inasmuch as it is desirable in the prosecution of the movement to take the minimum of risk and to call for the least sacrifice compatible with the attainment of the desired object: (a) the surrender of titles, honorary offices and nominated seats on local bodies; (b) a refusal to attend Government levees, darbars, official and semi-official functions; (c) the gradual withdrawal of children from schools and colleges owned, aided or controlled by Government, and in place of such schools and colleges the establishment of national schools and colleges in the various provinces ; (d) a gradual boycott of British courts by lawyers and litigants, and the establishment of private arbitration courts for the settlement of private disputes; (e) a refusal on the part of the military, clerical and labouring classes to offer themselves as recruits for service in Mesopotamia; (/) the withdrawal by candidates of their candidature for election, and a refusal on the part of voters to vote for any candidate who may offer himself for election ; (g) a boycott of foreign goods. &quot; Gradual &quot; was introduced at the desire of the majority, though characterized as weakness by Gandhi while some delegates wished to substitute &quot; British &quot; for &quot; foreign.&quot; Congress has appointed a committee consisting of Gandhi, Patel andMoti Lai Nehru to frame rules for the conduct of the non-co-operation campaign.The voting is instructive. The exact number of delegates present on the last day is not known, but, out of 5,814 delegates registered, only 2,735 took part in the voting, 1,852 voting for Gandhi s resolution and 883 for Pal&apos;s amendment. Every province, save the Central Provinces and Berar, had a majority for Gandhi. Lajput Rai&apos;s paper, Bande Mataram, commenting on the decision, says, &quot; Though adopted by an overwhelming majority, it cannot be said to be the decision of the whole nation.&quot; Other papers, while minimizing Gandhi s achievement, do not consider that the victory places him in a position to carry out the programme effectively. The majority of the local leaders have always been against it; the whole Nationalist Press opposed it, e.g., the Tribune, the Amrita Bazar Patrika, the Leader and the Independent. In Madras and Bengal the minority against Gandhi was very powerful. The great majority of the Punjab delegates were favourable to Gandhi&apos;s resolu-tion, but do not, we believe, represent the true feeling of the province. Similarly with the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, where the talukdars of Oudh have condemned the movement. Criticism is generally directed against the withdrawal of children from school and lawyers from practice. The result of non-co-operation is not realized as yet, though its limitations are beginning to be appreciated and the converse, Government exercising a similar power cf non-co-operation, is being put forward in the Press, e.g., the Leader. A possible division of the extremists into two parties may result, namely, the out-and-out followers of Gandhi and a combination of others with the moderates who can no longer have a place in Congress, which will remain the stronghold of the extremists. It is difficult to estimate the practical effect of the Congress decision at present. In the Council several non-officials openly dissociated themselves from the movement, and three leading politicians in Madras, including Kasturi Ayengar, have resigned. Baptista and Chandravarkar have also issued Press statements condemning non-co-operation. Iswar Saran has resigned the presidentship of the United Provinces Provincial Congress Committee as a protest against non-co-operation. On the other hand, in Madras, C. Eaghavacharia, and in Bengal 22 candidates for election (including B. Chakravarti and C. R. Das), most of whom voted against non-co-operation, have with-drawn their candidature for election out of loyalty to the Congress; while in the Punjab Bakshi Tek Chanel and Professor Ruchi&apos;Rani&apos;Salmi have withdrawn their candidature for election, though the former has resigned his secretaryship of the Punjab Provincial Congress Committee as a protest against non-co-operation. Gandhi, though now regarded with suspicion by the educated classes, has very great influence over the masses, which he may use mischievously at any time.The chief resolutions of the Caliphate Conference are as follows :-Jt offered its sympathy to the Indian Moslems going on hijrat and resolved that the Central Caliphate Committee should immediately make arrangements for the muhajarin; (2) it resolved to carry on a constant agitation against the Turkish peace terms until the temporal status of the Caliphate was restored ; (3) it resolved on non-co-operation as a religious obligation absolutely binding Indian Moslems;  (4) it expressed
gratitude to the Amir of Afghanistan for the Islamic brotherhood with which (sic) he received and treated the Indian muhajarin, and trusted that all possible facilities would be given in future to the Indian muhajarin - by the Afghan Government; (5) it considered that Hindu Moslem unity was absolutely essential for the future better-ment of India ; (6) it appealed to the Moslems of Iudia to collect at least 30 lakhs of rupees for the successful working of the Caliphate movement; (7) it urged the provincial committees to organize volunteer corps ; (8) it advised that a. deputation should visit all prominent Sajjadah Nashins to invite their attention to their religious obligations; (9) it expressed sympathy with the people of the North-West Frontier Province and Sind in their unjust official oppression for the Caliphate movement.; and (10) it congratulated Egypt on securing national independence by constant agitation and sacrifice.The latest report regarding the hijrat shows the muhajarin arriving back via Khyber and through the Mohmand country. The resettlement in Peshawar is proceeding satisfactorily, and there is considerable expression of gratitude to the Government. In the Banuu district malicious agitators continue to mislead the people into disbelieving the stoppage of hijrat. Efforts have been made to dissuade the muhajarin from proceeding to Afghanistan, but this may have to be relaxed, as the only way of bringing them to reason is to let them learn the lesson as the people of Peshawar have done. In the North-West Punjab it is reported that the feeling against the Afghans is growing bitter as they raped women who went on hijrat. Endeavours are being made to organize the opposition to the Caliphate party. People who resigned service are endeavouring to get back if they can evade the oath they swore. In the Punjab generally there is a distinct lull in political activity, which may break out afresh on the return of the congress delegates from Calcutta. Zafar Ali Khan, editor and proprietor of the Zamindar newspaper, was arrested on his arrival at Lahore, and will be placed on trial for violently seditious speeches made recently at Attock.The trial of the accused in the Willoughby murder case has begun.In consequence of the disallowance of the resolution proposed to be moved by Sastri on the Punjab disturbance, 23 resolutions were withdrawn on the 14th by Messrs. Sastri, Sinba, Chanda and Khaparde as a protest, and Patel has resigned. Sastri, in an interview, bitterly criticized the action as proof of the impotence of the Imperial Legislative Council and the humiliating position of members. The last meeting, yesterday, passed off harmoniously. Many questions on the Hunter Report were answered. Congratulatory speeches were made by Messrs. Sastri,&apos;Sinha, Banerjee and others on the passage of the Territorial and Auxiliary Force Bill. The Viceroy, in a farewell speech, after paying a high tribute to the retiring Commander-in-Chief, made an impressive appeal for the restoration of good feeling. Referring to the fact that he had disallowed Mr. SastrFs resolution dealing with the Punjab disturbances, he said these matters had been discussed in Parliament, Council and the Press for 18 months, and if peace and goodwill were to be restored, the discussion must be ended if possible. He felt as keenly as anyone regardiug the need of holding Indian life and honour sacred in times of crisis like last year&apos;s, and the Government were preparing measures to prevent the recurrence of errors and excesses, but each new discussion only made the chances of reconciliation mole remote. Finally, he alluded to the coming and larger representative assembly, and said institutions of (? everlasting) British traditions do not die, they find a new birth in re-incarnation. The speech was very well received in the Council, and apparently impressed all the non-official members considerably, but it is impossible to say at present what the effect of disallowing of the resolution or of the Viceroy&apos;s farewell speech will be on the country at large. The extremist papers are certain to make the most of the former, but there are many moderates who think that the Punjab controversy is best buried now.   How far they will have the courage to say so is another matter.There is considerable labour unrest in Madras on account of the lock-out of strikers by the management of the oil companies. On the 10th, an assistant while on his way to the installation was attacked and stabbed, apparently by locked-out workmen. Later in the day a collision occurred between the police and a mob attempting to attack the installation. There were no casualties or serious injuries, but police officers and others were struck by stones. The police dispersed the mob and made four arrests. .In Bihar Council on the 11th, the Lieutenant-Governor announced the release of more Shahabad prisoners : the action was enthusiastically received.
II. (26tli September). The report from Bengal.on the discussions in the Subject Committee of the Special Congress shows that the Committee was divided (? into) three groups : firstly, out-and-out supporters of Gandhi, consisting of Shaukat Ah, Chakravarti, Yakub Hnssain, &amp;c. ; secondly, partial supporters, 0, R. Das, B. G. Pal, Malaviya; thirdly, definite opponents, Jinnah, Mrs. Besant, Dwarka Das, Jamna Das. The second party opposed the withdrawal of children from the schools, the boycott of British Courts and the withdrawal from council elections.   Gandhi himself was subjected to considerable heckling.   He refused to admit that his policy would lead to violence and bloodshed, and maintained that it would strengthen the British connexion, revolution being the only alternative.   While deprecating violence, he was prepared to see non-co-operators putting the screw on co-operators.   Pressed to declare his next move should non-co-operation fail, he refused to contemplate such a possibility.    When the feeling of the Committee turned against him Gandhi intimated that he woidd carry on his policy whether the Congress supported it or not, appealing to the masses.   The issue of co-operation or non-co-operation was never put to the vote.   But after the resolution had been adopted by the Congress a further meeting of the Committee was held.   C. R. Das pointed out the legal objections to the  programme  ancl  the  dangers  in a   prosecution,  e.g.,  under the  Corrupt Practices Act.   A  sub-committee  consisting  of Gandhi, Moti Lai Nehru ancl Patel was    appointed  to   frame instructions    to   carry out   the  programme, to   be   submitted  to   the   All-India   Committee   after   a   month;   in   the meantime effect will   be given to  the resolution wherever possible.    It was agreed . in   an   informal   discussion   that   members   who   cannot   accept   the decision of majority and embrace practical non-co-operation must leave the Congress. A suggested practical step is the organization of a strike among lascars and ships&apos; employees with a view to furthering the boycott of foreign goods.   It is too early to gauge the results or effect of the adoption of the programme at present; but 22 resignations or withdrawals from candidature for election beyond those advised last week have been reported from Bombay, including Baptista, Ivarandikar, and Kelkar. Gandhi is now&apos; iU and recuperating at Bolpur, and the work of the Committee is , probably delayed by this.   Gokaran Nath ancl. Ishwar Saran, of the United Provinces, resigned from the Congress owing to the non-co-operation policy.   Bengal candidates who resigned voted in most cases against Gandhi, and many had little chance of election. The extremist leaders will probably now mark time until the Christmas congress, when a determined effort will be made to recapture the congress and rescind the resolutions regarding school children and lawyers.   In the Press there is considerable discussion of the constitution&apos; of congress and its decision on non-co-operation, Khaparde considers that the time has come to recast the constitution, and to face the great danger of the manipulation of a body:at present unwieldy and ineffective ancl unable to give effect to modern idea of mass representation.   Finally the question whether the decision must be binding on all members is freely discussed : opinion is divided.   On the immediately effective point in the programme, the boycott of the councils, Malaviya refuses to accept the decision, and Gandhi has agreed that there is no necessity in every case that congress members should -withdraw from election. At a meeting at Sholapur, Sastri spoke strongly against non-co-operation.Provincial Opinion. Bombay. It is reported that the opinion of Nationalist circles is in a fluid state on non-co-operation, and variable as regards the boycott of councils. Khaparde will not withdraw. Baptista accused Gandhi of handing over the congress to Mohamedans, but has withdrawn his candidature out of loyalty (to) the Congress. GandbFs acceptance of the boycott of foreign goods is resented by wealthy Bombay merchants, the mainstay of the central Caliphate Committee. The reports from Sind indicate a greatly improved atmosphere there.United Provinces. Agitation on the Caliphate question shows no sign of abatement. Efforts continue to be made in outlying towns and villages to reach the masses. No practical results of non-co-operation are yet apparent, but the adoption of GandhPs programme may give a momentary impetus, especially as Gandhi ancl Shaukat Ah intend touring the province. Pandit Ram Narain, a violent Caliphate lecturer, was prosecuted ancl bound over, but failed to give security ; there was but little attempt to defend him on the part of the local bar, and no demonstration when he was taken to jail. He and another paid, itinerant agitator also being prosecuted under other sections of the Indian Penal Code.Bihar and Orissa. The resolution of the provincial conference in favour of non-co-operation was passed largely by the votes (of) delegates from Ivisan Sabhas (peasant associations), of whom 180 were present.   This agrarian development was
THE DOMINIONS.Suggested Meeting of the British Empire Delegation. On 8th September the liigh Commissioner of Canada informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that he had. been req uested to ascertain whether a preliminary conference of the British Empire Delegation would be held before the meeting of the assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva on 15th November. To this Lord Milner replied on 18th September that His Majesty&apos;s Government wordcl welcome such, a meeting and that an intimation to that effect was being sent to the other Dominions. On the same 20-5 cchiefly marked in Bihar, and the United Provinces will require careful watching, as it may develop into a no-rent movement and may be taken up by Gandhi if he does not get&quot;the requisite support from the educated&apos;classes.At Partabgarh, United Provinces, recently a large number of ryots collected to rescue by force a local leader of the movement who was being prosecuted, and a breach of the peace was with difficulty averted. The responsible political leaders of the province are wholly opposed to the non-co-operation movement; but it is doubtful whether they will stand openly against it, A Sadhu is being prosecuted for tampering with troops.North-Wast Frontier Province. The hijrat movement is scotched at present. The work of repatriating returned muhajarin is proceeding steadily and successfully, and all classes of the people are co-operating in assisting the officers on special duty to complete the arrangements satisfactorily. The attempt of some leaders and mullahs to keep the movement alive is meeting with scanty success. It remains to be seen how far the non-co-operation movement will advance.Punjab.-Kitchlew will now, it is understood, lead the non-co-operation move-ment. Zafar Ali (vide last week&apos;s telegram) is being prosecuted. Gandhi&apos;s influence with the masses is very great. Willoughby&apos;s murder continues to be condemned, but Gandhi only half-heartedly condemned the murder itself and made allowances for the murderers. Sbaukat Ali is reported to advocate the view that non-co-operation is merely a trial of strength to be followed by the murder of European officers and their Indian assistants. Disturbances occurred last week at Agra between Hindus and Mohamedans during a local festival. Some 25 men,,including three head constables, were injured. A meeting was subsequently called by the district magistrate. The temper of the people was unsatisfactory, and they refused arbitration. A public meeting was also held, and later there was a further ebullition of violence, lathis being freely used. Eventually the delegation leaders proceeded to Agra and called a* mass, meeting of Hindus&quot;(? and) Mohamedans. They effected a reconciliation, shops were opened, and lawlessness came to an end. The Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces went to Agra, but the latest Press messages show that the situation is quiet, and Muharran passed off without further incident.Sporadic Labour Trouble. The oil workers&apos; strike at Madras, according to a Press report just. received, was, settled by the intervention, of the Governor. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company&apos;s employees are restive, and a strike occurred amongst the Europeans at Jamshedpur, of whom the majority belong to English Unions and receive help from them.There were serious disturbances at some tea gardens in the Lakhimpur District, Assam, when the Superintendent of the Police and his assistant and the assistant manager&apos;were injured.   Assam Rifles were called in.The Central Provinces Government has, in deference to public opinion, withdrawn Government support from the Ratona abattoir, and has cancelled the agreement made with the Company.In Assam and Bengal a vigorous agitation is being pursued for the reversion of Sylhet to Bengal. The Chief Commissioner&apos; has been authorised to issue a coiu-munique denying various misleading rumours as to the effect of the present arrangements.Private Chilcott, accused in the Kacha Garhi case, has been acquitted by court-martial.The Indian Press, including some moderate papers, is vigorously objecting to (? the shipment of) all our Indian troops to Mesopotamia.
day lie telegraphed to the Governor-General of Australia and to the Officers Administering the Governments of New Zealand and South Africa saying that the Canadian Government was being informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome such a meeting if the Governments of the Dominions and India could arrange to be represented.Special, - Renter Service. On 21st September the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Officer Administering the Government of the Union of South Africa as follows :  The replies received to my telegram of 24th June as to the value of the service were divergent. Generally speaking, the Mediterranean and West African Colonies, Ceylon, and New Zealand were against, whilst, in addition to the Union, the East African dependencies, Malaya, and Hong Kong favoured its continuance. In these circumstances, I have been enquiring from ReuteFs the cost of a service confined to the parts of the Empire in favour of continuance, and have ascertained that contributions on the previous scale still available, together with a contribution of approximately one-third of the total cost from His Majesty&apos;s Government, would suffice for the service of 6,000 words, costing 2501., per month to the Union of South Africa, the East African dependencies, Malaya, and Hong Kong. In the circum-stances it is proposed to arrange for such a service for three months experimentally, commencing 1st October, and to notify Reuter&apos;s on 27th September. If your Ministers see any objection I should be glad to be informed at earliest possible moment.On the following day the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Officer Adminis-tering the Government of New Zealand, saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government were grateful to the New Zealand Government for their offer to continue to contribute for the next six months, but as the replies to his telegram of 24th June were divergent, and it was found that only the Union of South Africa, the East African dependencies, Malaya, and Hong Kong were in favour of continuance, it had been decided to restrict the service to the latter parts of the Empire as from 1st October. Consequently the service to New Zealand would be discontinued after 30th September.In reply to the message sent to South Africa,-the Officer Administering the Government of the Union telegraphed on 28th September as follows : Assuming that the Union&apos;s contribution will not exceed 7001. per annum for a service of 6,000 wrords per. month, my Ministers have no objection to the adoption of the proposed arrange-ment for a period oh three months from 1st October.CANADA.Bacon. On 18th September the following message from the Prime Minister of Canada to Mr. Lloyd George was telegraphed by the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : The Canadian pork producing industry has been seriously injured since the cessation of hostilities by the control of the price of Canadian bacon which is sold in Great Britain. Farmers are rapidly unloading pig stocks, since the Ministry of Food insist on maintaining such low prices that pig feeding is made absolutely unprofitable and impossible for export from this country. Many representations to no purpose have been made through our High Commissioner. We protest against the discrimina-tion of the Canadian product which is involved in the present methods, and still more against the new methods which are now proposed. It is very important to have decontrol instituted at once or else to have a much higher price than is allowed at present on Canadian bacon. [Continued outcry and] criticism from producers and farmers here is being excited by the action of the Food Ministry. I hope that it will be possible for you to have this matter of decontrol promptly dealt with to our satisfaction.To this the Secretary of State for the Colonies replied on 25th September as follows: As I had already taken up the question personally with the Food Controller before its receipt, the Prime Minister has asked me to reply. The Ministry of Food realize fully the importance of maintaining the Canadian bacon industry. Since re-control was imposed in August 1919 theyJiave consistently paid to Canadians for bacon higher prices than they have realized in this country, and on all purchases have consequently lost money.   The differential between prices paid by the Ministry to-.
producers for Canadian and American bacon bas been higher since control than at any time previous to control. The Ministry of Food are paying very considerably more for Canadian bacon than they are paying for Danish bacon, which is of superior quality. As de-control would prejudice the British consumer gravely it is thought quite impossible at the present time. For the September putdown of Canadian bacon the Ministry have offered to pay 35&apos; cents per lb. f.a.s. ordinary stowage, 34 cents refrigerated space. They are anxious to favour the Canadian producer in every possible way which does not involve a complete sacrifice of the interests of the British consumer, and, therefore, if the Canadian Government consider this offer too low, they would like the views of the Canadian Government as to what is a fair price to give for the September putdown of Canadian bacon, and also for the October, November, and December putdown. The Ministry cannot afford to pay extravagant prices, but are prepared to give such price as will cover the reasonable cost of production, as they realize the importance of the Canadian bacon industry.Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been reported from the Department of External Affairs (22nd September 1920): (1) The Canadian wheat crop is now officially estimated at 289,000,000 bushels ; oats have yielded about 556,000,000 bushels, barley 64,250,000 bushels, rye 13,000,000 bushels, and flax -seed 11,000,000 bushels. This Will prove the most valuable grain crop in respect of monetary returns in the history of Canada.(2) Business conditions are generally satisfactory throughout the Dominion.(3) Canadian bank clearings during the week ended 17th August were 17 per cent, in excess of those for the corresponding period of last year.(4) The total external trade of the Dominion for the past five months reaches a total value of $1,063,000,000.(5) Canadian imports during August were worth $124,31S,000, exports amounting to $114,000,000. Wood pulp and paper lead in the list of products exported during August, the total shipments being worth approximately $32,000,000, an increase of $11,000,000 on the figures for August 1919.   -(6) The Congress of Chambers of Commerce of the Empire at Toronto has adopted resolutions urging a,greater development of the natural resources of the British Empire ; a greater use of the timber produced in British countries; direct cable communications between the West Indies and the rest of the Empire; and the promotion of cotton growing within the Empire.AUSTRALIA.Budget Speech. On 17th September the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State that on the previous clay the Treasurer had delivered his budget speech.
