The following paragraphs are taken from the Reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending 7th August and 14th August :-Industrial Situation. The opinion, is being expressed by many people that the early weeks of the autumn will witness an industrial crisis of considerable severity, in which wages disputes may be combined with extensive action against high prices and increased rents. On the other hand, the preliminary warnings of a period of industrial depression to commence about the same time as the anticipated industrial crisis are being extensively advertised, and the industrial leaders of labour, like the political leaders, are adopting a restrained and conservative attitude.In so far aa more strictly political activity is concerned, attention has been concentrated upon the opening of the Congress of the Second International at Geneva. An account of this conference, and of the Miners&apos; International Conference, will be given in this Report next week. The formation of a United Communist Party on the 31st July is a more important event than the formation of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst&apos;s Communist Party oh the 19th June, but neither of these parties exerts much influence-on the labour situation.   [7th August.]The industrial disputes situation remains comparatively.quiet. In the woollen textile trade hopes of a settlement have been brought nearer by the recommendation of the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trade for acceptance of the employers&apos; latest offer. The meeting of engineering and shipbuilding trade unions in London on the 6th August decided to withdraw from the wages agreement of 1917. This implies a repudiation of the policy of making applications to the Industrial Court for increased wages and the substitution therefor of direct negotiations with the employers. It does not, however, open up the immediate possibility of a large industrial dispute. Trouble is threatened among building trades operatives in the south-western area, owing to the deadlock reached by the National Conciliation Board over their claims for higher rates. The occasion of much unrest in this trade, however, may be removed by the setting up of a National Wages and Conditions Council to take the place of the present Conciliation Board machinery. The meeting of the special delegate conference ol the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain on the 12th August to decide the policy to be adopted in reply to the Governments refusal to entertain their double demand for increased wages and reduced coal prices is the most important industrial matter pending at the close of the week.In the political sphere the first General Congress of the reconstituted Second International at Geneva is important as marking the completion of the first stage in the post-war reconstruction of international Socialism. By passing a unanimous resolution on the subject of war responsibility, one of the main obstacles to unity within the International has been overcome. A definite declaration of hostility towards Bolshevism was made. The proposal to transfer the Bureau to London points to the leadership of the Second International being in the hands of British Labour.   [14th August.]Unemployment Insurance BilL-The Unemployment Insurance Bill was read a -third time, and passed, with some amendments, by the House of Lords on the 29th July.   The Bill received Royal Assent on the 9th August.Bread Subsidy. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the House of Commons on the 11th Axtgust that the Government had determined, to abolish the bread subsidy by the end of the current financial year.   An increase of 3c?. in the price of the quartern loaf would be made in September, and the remainder of the -subsidy would be removed at. or before the opening of the next financial year.The Labour Party. A further step has been taken in the development of joint working arrangements between the co-operative movement, the Trades Union Congress, and the Labour Party. At a meeting of representatives of the three bodies, held on the 27th July, it was decided to appoint a sub-committee to draft a detailed scheme for joint working as regards publicity, the collection of statistical and other information, and legal advice. This scheme will then be considered by the full Co-ordination Committee of the three bodies before the meeting of the Trades Union Congress on the 6th September.   [7th August.]
The dominant feature of the week lias been the attitude of- Labour towards the -developments in the Russo-Polish situation. A belief in the possibility of uar with Russia over Poland led to a mobilization of organized Labour opinion during the week-end. The formation of a &quot; Council of Action &quot; on the 9th August and the summoning of a special national conference of Labour bodies for the 13th, show that the machinery necessary for organizing a general strike is being : immediately1 improvised. One notable feature of the developments is the fact -that the moderate leaders of Labour, and men who have repudiated direct action on such political questions as nationalization of the mines, are unanimous Avith the more extreme elements of the present issue. According, however, to the statements made by Mr. E. Bevin in the interview between the Council of Action and the Prime Minister -on the 10th, and by Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., in the debate in the House of Commons on the same date, the independence of Poland is an integral part of LabouFs international policy. The difference between Labour and the Government appears, therefore, to be a difference of interpretation of the extent to which Polish independence is threatened by Soviet Russia.   [14th August.]COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.Petition for Responsible Government [B.E.R., xviii, p. 3]. On 6th August theSecretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the High Commissioner for South Africa as follows : I regret that I am not yet in a position to tender any advice to His Majesty in respect of the Resolution of the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia in favour of Responsible Government. I fully appreciate the importance which they attach to an early settlement, and the whole subject has been receiving my most careful attention, but the difficulties are very serious. The award of Lord Cave&apos;s Commission will clearly be an important factor in the case, but, as you know, this Commission has not yet reported and is not likely to report for some time. For this and other reasons no decision can be taken at the present moment, but the Council may rest assured that there will be no avoidable delay.   Please inform Council accordingly.EGYPT.Russian Ships at Port Said [B.E.R., xxiii, p. 4]. On 7th August Mr. Scott telegraphed from Cairo as follows : There was some division of opinion amongst the personnel as to going to the Crimea, but the majority, headed by the commander of the squadron, were strongly opposed to that course. The cadets were prepared to follow the com-mandeFs advice. Meanwhile, coal and stores were practically exhausted, and in order to avert serious trouble, including the possibility that the majority mentioned above might scuttle the ships in Port Said rather than trust themselves to General Wrangehs organization, it was necessary to supply coal and provisions to enable the ships to leave without delay. At my request these were advanced by the Egyptian Government. The Yakut sailed for Ragusa to-day, and the Orel sails to-morrow for the same destination, of course without the sanction of the Russian Minister.INDIA.Bmicjration.-On 5th August the Viceroy reported [No. 205] that over 1,200 mahajarins, principally from the Peshawar district, had passed through the Khyber during ,the previous week, and further parties had gone through the Mohmand country. Emigration on this scale was having an unsettling effect on the Afridis and the tribes to the north. Increasing interest in the Caliphate question-was being displayed in these districts.
The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on 6th August and 13th August:  &apos;.I. (6th August). The United Provinces report that the bitterness caused by the Dyer controversy shows no sign of abatement. Bombay, on the contrary, reports that the extremists are making the most of the debate in the House of Lords, but the feeling is growing that the matter should be allowed to drop ; recent articles in the Bengalee and the Leader rather take the same view. Pickford&apos;s appeal, reported last week, has been on the whole well received.2. Moreover, the political situation shows some tendency to improve in most parts of India, but the mahajarin excitement is still very great in the North-West Frontier Provinces and Sind. The Chief Commissioner is particularly anxious-regarding the situation in Peshawar. The Afghans in the Punjab, also the hijrat movement, have given rise to considerable unrest, resulting in the resuscitation in a violent form of the Caliphate agitation, large demonstrations being held and seditious speeches delivered. Excitement has also been roused by the tour of Gandhi and Shaukat Ali, giving instructions for hartal to be observed on 1st August. People generally in the Punjab, however, are by no means convinced of the advisability of adopting the policy of non-co-operation. The Bombay moderate leaders have issued a manifesto condemning, and emphasizing the danger of, the non-co-operation movement. . Similarly, the Deccan Liberal party passed resolutions disapproving of non-co-operation-It is anticipated that the special congress, to be held in Calcutta early in September, may find means of covering the refusal to adopt non-co-operation, but of supporting the demand for the withdrawal of Indian troops engaged in. the Middle East, for employment against Moslems. The Council of India Moslem League recently passed a resolution to this effect, which has been taken up by the Bombay Chronicle, and a sustained Press campaign is expected.   This would be a serious development.Bengal. Non-co-operation is being pushed by the extremist Press, but there is no apparent enthusiasm among the people. The local governments have forfeited security of the newspaper N aba jug, which published a harmful leaderlet enjoining people not to enlist as soldiers or to proceed as soldiers or sailers to Mesopotamia, Proceedings, under section 108, Code of Criminal Procedure, are also contemplated ;. other local governments has been warned of the leaderlet and the action taken.North-West Frontier Province. There is no improvement in the internal situation. Mahajarins are passing through in large numbers, and many are departing from the-district. The Each Gari incident has greatly inflamed feeling. We have decided, in consultation with the Chief Commissioner and the military authorities, that Private Chilcott should be tried by court-martial for the attempted murder of pathah Muhajif, and a communique to this effect is being published. Lieutenant Hewett is held not to be blameworthy for his death, but the Chief Commissioner presses for departmental action by the military authorities. Hewett, on the other hand, is grossly libelled in the report published by the Peshawar Caliphate Committee,, and has been advised to take legal proceedings, which he approves.United Provinces.-There is a general disinclination among Mussulmans to take an active part in the non-co-operation movement, but loyal Mussulmans are uncertain of the results of appeals made after 1st August.   The lawyers made it clear to the-Caliphate Committee that they expect others to make sacrifices, not themselves.Delhi-The extension applied to the Seditious Meetings Act led to less criticism than was expected. The local Press is comparatively restrained. Gandhi forbade any defiance of orders. Heavy securities have been demanded from the Indian Press for printing hartal posters advising students and masters to quit the schools.Burma. The Caliphate Committee have decided that active participation in the-non-co-operation movement is uncalled for in Burma, where action should be confined to sympathy.3. Gandhi has returned to Kaira, and on arrival issued an improper letter to the Viceroy, and a manifesto attacking the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding Turkey as immoral and unscrupulous, expressing dissatisfaction at the conduct of the Government over the Punjab disturbances, and inviting the prosecution of himself for-disaffection towards the Government, though urging the people to take his prose-cution quietly. We have no present intention of making him a martyr, and thus-strengthening a movement which is, we hope, likely to fail. Consciousness of this fact seems to have prompted the manifesto.   Eeports of the hartal on 1st August,.
summarized below, justify the belief that it was far from being generally successful, and in any case does not indicate that non-co-operation will be supported.Bombay-A. disturbance occurred at Karachi, where boys tried to force two cinemas to close down. There was some destruction of property. Hartal in Bombay was little different from the last, but Tila&apos;k&apos;s death gave it considerable impetus. * There was a meeting of 4,000 persons ; resolutions supporting non-co-operation were passed, but the speeches were moderate. There was little sympathy for the movement in the Central and South em divisions, except in Sholapur, where there was partial hartal, probably in mourning for Tilak. There was practically complete hartal in the districts of Ahmadabad and Kaira, as well as in Karachi and Larkhana, but partial in Hyderabad, the main centre of the movement in Sind. Pir Mahbub Shah was arrested at Karachi under section 124 (A) Indian Penal Code. A crowd collected at the jail, and half of the warders and half of the prisoners struck work. 40 British ranks were despatched and the crowd was dispersed, the troops withdrew, and there were no further disturbances, although the crowd was in a sensitive mood until late in the evening of the 2nd, when the town began to take on its normal aspect. The threatened further hartal, as a protest against the arrest of Pir Mahbub Shah, failed to materialize. The District Magistrate issued an order, to be in force for two months, forbidding interference with shopkeepers and gari-wallas, either by persuasion, coercion or intimidation-dation. There has been no manifestation of non-co-operation anywhere in the Presidency, save some resignations by a few subordinates and three menials in each large district. Devji Ganji resigned his membership of Council before the hartal, and not on account of the non-co-operation movement.Bengal. Hartal was practically a failure. There was no general observance of it in Calcutta, only a few shops being closed. At a meeting held at the Town Hall 6,000 were present. Elsewhere there has been no general observance, fasting or prayer. In some big towns the shops were partially closed. Hindus have been little affected, and Mohamedans only very partially ; no enthusiasm has been shown. The only instances of non-co-operation are the return of one recruitment certificate, the refusal of one invitation to the Darbar and of one invitation to the GovernoPs garden party.Madras. In the city, almost all the shops were shut, but, being Sunday, it is difficult to say whether this is due to hartal. The meeting of 10,000, half of them Hindus, was spoilt by rain. Nothing objectionable happened beyond the hoisting of the Turkish flag ancl a resolution approving the non-co-operation movement. In Mofussil it was a half-hearted hartal; a few meetings were held, no disturbances were reported, and no manifestation of non-co-operation was noticed.Delhi. Hartal was practically complete in the main bazars, in the smaller bazars very slight, in the lanes totally ignored. Ordinary manual labour and traffic was not affected. Meetings were held in the small villages outside Delhi, to avoid the application of the Seditious Meetings Act, and resolutions were passed adopting non-co-operation and calling for the withdrawal of Indian troops from overseas. One barrister of well-known seditious reputation, with small practice, announced his withdrawal from practice; one head constable of indifferent morals resigned.United Provinces. Hartal was observed in most headquarter towns and in a few others, but was partial and half-hearted. It was the worst supported hartal so far held. There was no hartal in the districts. There is no indication of any excitement or enthusiasm.   There is one resignation of the title of Khan Bahadur.Punjab. Complete hartal took place in Lahore, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Hosaripur (sic Hoshiapur?), Multan, Sargodha, Simla, Pathankot. There was partial hartal, Hindu shopkeepers not generally participating, in Hissar, Pohtak, Karnal, Mofft-gomery, Gujranwalla, Jhang, Gujerat and Jullundur. No hartal in Umballa, Sialkot, Lyallpur, Attoek, Mianwali and Muzaffargarh. A few meetings were held and resolutions passed, ancl prayers on behalf of Turkey offered. There were no mani-festations of non-co-operation, and no disturbances anywhere.Bihar and Orissa. A fairly successful hartal occurred in Patna, but few shops were closed in the main roads, and others were only partially closed,, but were transacting business. It was partially observed inMorghyr, Gaya, Chapra,.Bhagalpur, Eanchi. Elsewhere it was not observed. Participation in many cases was due to the desire to avoid worry. Meetings were held in a few places. There were disturbances, ancl there was a lack of enthusiasm everywhere. Three resignations, one of title, one of honorary magistracy, and one of membership of Legislative Council, have been made. 19-3 is
North-West Frontier Province. There was complete hartal in Peshawar, Nowshera, and Kohat, where Hindus participated unwillingly. It was partial in Hoti Mardan, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Haripur, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan. A general unwillingness of Hindus to join was observed. No hartal took place in other . towns or villages, but the inhabitants of rural areas visited Peshawar in large numbers. There were no disorders. Non-co-operation generally was advocated, but there is no sign yet of the movement increasing. Teachers of the district board school in Peshawar have resigned, twelve constables in Kohat resigned, and other resignations have taken place elsewhere, partly clue to dissatisfaction with pay. A large meeting was held in Idgah, Peshawar City, where the Caliphate leaders appear to have discouraged non-co-operatiou. Several meetings pressed for revision of the Turkish peace terms.Burma. Hartal was observed only by Mohamedans, partially in Rangoon.. There were no public meetings and no enthusiasm. It passed almost unnoticed and the doctrine of non-co-operation was not preached.Central Provinces.-The news of Tilak&apos;s death caused a stoppage of business in the Maratha districts, but hartal itself proved a failure except in Jubbulpore and Nimar, where it was partially successful, No disorder, no manifestation of non-co-operation took place.Assam. Hartal was only observed in Dibrugarh, where there was a mass meeting, and at Dhubri, where certain shops were closed. Everything is quiet. There is no interest or enthusiasm, and no manifestation of non-co-operation.4. Strikes of some importance have arisen at the Government presses at Calcutta and Delhi. At Calcutta, about 600 men out of 3,000 are still at work, and 100 out of 560 at Delhi. The terms of employment, recently revised, include generous concessions in the matter of wages and pension, and the establishment of a works committee has been agreed to, but agitation centres round the demand for the abolition of piece rates. The Calcutta extremist party is supported by B. C. Pal, Nawab Ali, and other agitators. In Delhi, Asaf Ali, the barrister referred to above, is the moving spirit. A considerable section in Calcutta is believed to favour a return to work, and the Delhi strikers are weakening, as offers of assistance from politicians have proved worthless. Simla is uneasy, but the press is working. Most of the men in the Bengal Government Press and Madras Government Press are also on strike. \5. Serious floods are reported at Attock, Bihar and Orissa. A general estimate of damage and loss of life is impossible at present. The rivers are falling, hut are still high. Much depends on the speed with which the flood subsides. The general hope is that the loss of life is not verygreat.II. (13th August). Interest in the Dyer debate is not so prominent, but the debate iu the House of Lords has attracted considerable attention. Tilak&apos;s death occupies public attention. The Press eulogizes his work and condemns the Statesman for lack of appreciation and the severe criticism of Tilak&apos;s political tactics.2. We have given separately an appreciation of the hijrat movement and develop-ments in Sind. Special officers are being deputed to safeguard the property of sepoys and others in Government service. A curious sidelight on the situation is shown by a petition received from the Afghan residents of Khost, deprived of lands in favour of mahajariiis, asking to be allowed to immigrate to India. The Commissioner in Sincl has also made it clear that special trains will not be provided for mahajarins from stations in Sind.3. The first stage of non-co-operation seems definitely to have failed. A few further resignations are reported for example, 12 honorary magistrateships from Madras. The resignations of the two Members of Council, reported from Bengal last week, were sent in by the Secretary of the Caliphate Committee, and not by the two members themselves, who have not yet confirmed the Secretary&apos;s action. In the Central Provinces, Khan Bahadur H. M. Malak, a man of influence and wealth, announced his intention of resigning his title, but next clay recanted. The Government policy of non-intervention is generally appreciated, Opposition to the movement has come from within, as moderate men see its dangers. Attention is also beginning to be devoted to the legal and constitutional aspects of the four stages of non-co-operation by those who have been asked to participate. Srinivasa Ayengar has definitely declared the third and fourth stages to be, in his opinion, illegal and unconstitutional.
At the same time, ii non-co-operation fails the extremists will try some new method of -embarrassing the Government, e.g., boycotting of British goods. Anti-British feeling las been much incensed by the Dyer debates.4. The trial of Pir Mahbub Shah began on the 10th in the central jail, Hyderabad. The accused declined to defend himself or to cross-examine, being charged under section 124 A, for a violent speech delivered 19th June, in which he urged Mussulmans to make war on the British Government, and to sacrifice their lives. It was the bounden duty of Islam to fight at once with the enemies who fired guns at the Kaaba; the zamindars should not pay assessment; Government servants should leave the service ; licensed holders should surrender their licences ; life and property should be sacrificed in the war of Islam ; Mussulmans should leave the country and go to war; they should send their children to fight; they should destroy the railway lines so that the coming and going of troops might be stopped; they should not go to -Government courts, but decide disputes according to the Shariat.Bombay informs us that Mahbub is about 40 years of age; his condition was said to be fairly good on 9th August, and he had promised to take food that evening. &quot;Gandhi and Skaukat Ali were reported to have postponed their tour to Madras, and to have started for Hyderabad in connexion with the case, but are now said to have returned to Bombay on 9th August, being stopped en route by wire from Hyderabad.THE DOMINIONS.Austrian Debls.-On 7th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governors-General of Canada and Australia and the Officer Administering the Government of New Zealand, that the question of Austrian debts had been further considered, and in view of the general preference of interests concerned at home for the adoption of the clearing office scheme (without an undertaking by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent of payment in full) it was probable that Article 248 would be adopted as between the United Kingdom and Austria, with, or without modification by arrangement with the Government of Austria. The matter would be discussed with the Austrian Minister of Finance, who was about to arrive. If His Majesty&apos;s Government adopted the Article in the case of the United Kingdom, the Colonies, and the Protectorates, the Secretary of State asked if their Ministers wished to alter their previous decision not to adopt it. The matter was most urgent, since under the Treaty any notification should be given to Austria by 16th August.cImperial Wireless Scheme.-The Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia and South Africa and the Officer Administering the Government of New Zealand on 11th August as follows : -With reference to my Dominions Despatch No. 274 of 3rd July, His Majesty&apos;s Government have now examined the proposals in the Report of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee. Subject to the Chancellor of the Exchequer being satisfied as to the practicability, from the technical point of view, of carrying out the Imperial Wireless Scheme without the use (or with the use at reasonable cost) of certain master patents which the Marconi Company claim to be indispensable, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are on their part now prepared to adopt the recommendations as stated in pages 27 and 28 of the Report.His Majesty-s Government would be glad to learn at the earliest possible date the views of your Government.With regard to foreign countries, His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the Committee^ recommendation that long-distance wireless communications should be left to private enterprise, and that licences, if desired, for the erection of stations for such communications, should be issued to commercial companies under suitable conditions, a special Committee being appointed to decide the issue of licences as far as the United Kingdom is concerned.CANADA.Preliminary Conference on Communications. On 4th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Governor-General: -Referring to my telegram of 22nd July, a note has been received from the American Ambassador, stating that it is considered desirable by the United States
Government that the status of former German cables, ceded to the, five principal Allied and Associated Powers by the Treaty of Peace with Germany, should be-finally determined at the preliminary conference at Washington, before proceeding to discuss the agenda for the International Communications Conference. The proposed date for the latter conference is now loth November 1920.&apos;The following subjects, in addition to the disposition of the cables renounced by Germany, are proposed by the United States Government for discussion at the pre-liminary conference:  (1) Considering means of furthering inter-communication between the countries associated during the war, with a view to the maintenance of friendly relations.(2) General discussion of all international aspects of communications by land telegraphs, cables or wireless telegraphy, with a view to providing the entire world with adequate facilities of this nature, on a fair and equitable basis.(3) Consideration of the Radio Protocol of 25th August 1919. (4) Preparation of  agenda and a plan of  organization for  the November conference.(5) Discussion whether meetings of  the Radio-Telegraphy and Telegraph Congresses should be called, or whether they shall be merged into the main conference-Copies of the United States&apos; note are being sent by mail.  The 1919 Radio Protocol is being obtained and will be sent by mail as soon as possible.The Tariff. On 31st July the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to-the Officer Administering the Government of Canada as follows : , We understand that the Canadian Government is likely to take in hand shortly the revision of the Canadian tariff. The Board of Trade suggest that, in any enquiries preceding such revision, Bis Majesty&apos;,s Senior Trade Commissioner at Montreal may be found, useful as a channel through which information can be obtained as to the effect of the tariff on goods in which United Kingdom manufacturers are interested; and if the Canadian Government should so desire, the Trade Commissioner.would be instructed to attend and to give evidence before any Committee enquiring into the tariff question. Please telegraph reply so that the necessary instructions may be sent to the Trade Commissioner. -British War-ship fur Canada. Telegraphing on 7th August, the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governor-General of Canada that the Admiralty had offered the Royalist or the Aurora in substitution for the Glasgow, whilst recommending the Aurora. Hose had been furnished with particulars and would be given facilities for inspection.On 1.7th August the Governor-General sent the following reply to the above :  The Government of Canada gratefully accepts the Aurora in substitution for the Glasgow, and requests that there may be conveyed to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the expression of the. Government of Canada&apos;s appreciation of their courtesy in the substitntioii of an oil-burning ship to replace the Glasgow. .Railway Rates.-On 13th August the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows :-The Railway Department report that freight rates have been advanced by two increases, known respectively as 15 per cent, and 25 per cent, increases, but in the aggregate these have only produced about 30 per cent., that passenger rates have been increased by 10 per cent, and sleeping car fares by&apos; 20 per cent. The railway companies of Canada have an application for hearing before the Board of Railway Commissioners beginning on 10th August, in which they propose an increase of 40 per cent, on freight and switching, 20 per cent, on passenger and excess baggage, and a surcharge of 50 per cent, of the existing parlour and sleeping car charges as additional railway fare. If the full request is granted, it means the following increases over pre-war level: freight 82 per cent., sleeping cars 80 per cent. Demurrage rates have been increased by about 25 per cent., and there is an application in for 40 per cent, additional increase.   Many excursion and round trip rates have been cancelled.
Miscellaneous.-The following items of information have heen reported from the Department of External Affairs at Ottawa&apos;: 1. The Imperial Press Conference which has just been held at Ottawa&apos; was a splendid success in every respect. The delegates Were welcomed by the Duke of Devonshire, Governor-General of the Dominion, and by the Hon. Arthur Meighen, Prime -Minister, and the Hon. W. L. Mackenzie-King, Leader of. the Opposition, respectively. The delegates were tendered a banquet an Thursday evening, 5&apos;th August. Resolutions were adopted by the Conference favouring an improvement in the collection and distribution of news throughout the British Empire; the freedom of the Press, the elimination of the propaganda element from news, cheaper and uniform letter . and. periodical postal rates within the Empire, and interchange of editors between the British Isles and the Dominions to enable a better understanding of the problems, and the introduction of low cost wireless news collecting and distributing service throughout the Empire. The number of delegates in attendance was 130, of whom 100 were from overseas. -2. The new Canada-West Indies Trade Agreement provides for an increase in the preference from 20 to 50 per cent, in the case of British Guiana, Barbadoes and Trinidad, 33-1 per cent, in the case of the Windward Islands, the Leeward, Islands-and British Honduras ; and 25 per cent, in the case of Jamaica and Bermuda-; and 10 per cent, in the case of Bahamas. Weekly and fortnightly mail passenger and freight services is to be provided by the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, which marks the first departure of this State enterprise into the passenger business.3. Canadian crop conditions continue very favourable and the cutting of wheat will soon be general. Farmers are looking to the expected big crop to light the exchange situation. The wheat crop of the Dominion is estimated to reach 250,000,000 bushels.4. The probable date of the opening of the next Session of the Canadian Par&apos;.la-mem is 20th January.5. Immigrants are arriving in Canada at the rate of 18,000 persons monthly. Of these 12,000 on the average come from the United Kingdom and 6,000 from the United States.6. -Canadian railways have asked for an increase of 30 per cent. in. freight rates.7. About 1,700,000 acres of free land in Canada have already been granted to returned soldiers.AUSTRALIA.Meat. On 3rd August the following telegram was sent by the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : The Prime Minister advises me that, the Government of Western Australia authorizes him to negotiate with you for the inclusion of the output of their meat works atWyndham in His Majesty&apos;s Governments arrangements for thepurchase of Australian meat, and for the provision of the necessary freight to lift the same. A. seriously embarrassing position has arisen through the present inability to export. The killing season opened last April. Up to date, 12,000 bullocks have been killed, representing 2,300 tons of frozen beef, of which 900 tons was shipped by the Boorara, the balance being still on hand. The storage space now left is sufficient for a. fortnights killing only, and, unless immediate relief is forthcoming, 7,000 bullocks already bought will be turned adrift, with the resultant unemployment of operatives, and other serious consequences. There are enough fat cattle in sight to keep the works going until the end of September if the inclusion in British contracts is definitely arranged and freights provided. Western Australia is prepared to supply chilled beef, or frozen, at auction, and to accept the financial terms of the existing contracts. In view of Australia s financial position and the strong world demands for beef, he strongly recommends for favourable consideration the proposal for inclusion in the contracts, and would be glad to receive early advice as to whether this can be arranged.Copper.-On 6th August the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : -The Government -of the Commonwealth of Australia understands that the Ministry of Munitions, is offering Wallaroo copper at 21. under the Australian electrolytic.price. Prior to the war, Wallaroo shipped almost entirely to Europe, and later contracts provided for the electrolytic price plus a premium. During the war Wallaroo sold at electrolytic prices. The Company produces over 6,000 tons annually and complains that the action of the Ministry of Munitions will have a 19-3 C
detrimental effect on tire prices of future production. The Company maintains that-their copper is superior to the electrolytic for a certain class of manufacture, and considers it should fetch an equal price.

Canada.--It has been announced in the Canadian Parliament that it had been decided to defer for the present any action in regard to the adoption of a permanent naval policy for Canada, in view of Canada&apos;s heavy financial commitments, of the fact that Great Britain has not yet decided on her permanent naval policy, and of the approaching Imperial Conference, at which question of the naval defence of the Empire will come up for discussion. The Canadian Government has, however, accepted two torpedo boat destroyers and one light cruiser presented by the Admiralty, to take the place of the present obsolete and useless training ships Rainbow and Niobe. The vessels acquired by the Canadian Government will be manned exclu-sively by Canadian officers, except the senior officers on the light cruiser. The crews will consist of men recruited from the Imperial Navy up to about two-thirds of complement, the remainder being recruited in Canada. The Canadian Government have accepted also two modern submarines presented by the Admiralty.2. New Zealand. For financial reasons the New Zealand Government has decided for the present to adopt the report of Lord. Jeilicoe only to the following extent:  (a) To acquire the light cruiser Chatham, which has been presented by theAdmiralty.(b) To fit the Philomel for a training ship.The maintenance of the Chatham is estimated to cost 172,O00L per annum.There is no recent information here as to how far the New Zealand naval policy has been announced in Parliament, and it is suggested that enquiries should be made of the New Zealand Government.3. The Union of South Africa. No policy has yet been formulated.Pending discussion at the Imperial Conference, the Admiralty make the following suggestions as regards the utilization for naval purposes of any moneys made available by the Commonwealth Parliament: Ships. The Australia is of great value for training purposes, but she is expensive to maintain, and it is for consideration whether she could not be placed in&apos;
reserve and used for training purposes only, efforts being at present concentrated on the maintenance in commission of the remainder of the squadron, and the construction of submarines and light cruisers. It is not recommended to construct ships in connexion with naval aircraft work, as the best types to develop are still in an -experimental stage..Aircraft.-Reconnaissance machines for flying-off from light cruisers and for work from shore bases are recommended.Bases.-The development of Port Stephens is suggested to meet the requirements of the Australian Navy, which may eventually contain capital ships.Personnel.   Training to be continued to meet fleet requirements.Fuel. It is suggested that a start should be made towards the provision of large reserves of oil-fuel, which will be eventually necessary.Stores. The ultimate aim should be for Australia to be self-supporting in regard to munitions and other naval stores. The mterchangeabihty of stores and munitions between all portions of the Imperial fleet is extremely desirable.Preliminary Conference on Communications \see under &quot; Canada,&quot; p. 7]. -In reply to a notification, dated 4th August, from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, of the International Telegraphic Conference to be held at Washington, the Governor-General telegraphed on 17th August as follows: Australia is vitally interested in cable and wireless communications between it -and other parts of the world, but cannot be directly represented at the preliminary conference.

The Commonwealth desire- to be represented at the International Communications Conference, but the date proposed, loth November, will be rather early in view of the sitting of the Madrid Postal Congress, at which the permanent head of the Postmaster-Generahs Department will be the Australian delegate. 7th December, or later, would be more suitable date.NEW ZEALAND.League of Nations [B.E.R., xxi, p. 10].- The Officer Administering the Government reported on 4th August that Sir James Allen had been nominated by the Government of New Zealand to&apos;attend the meeting of the assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva on 15th November next.Wool [B.E.R., xxiii, p. 8].

The Government of New Zealand would be glad to accept the invitation of the Minister of Munitions to appoint two representatives of New Zealand wool growers to take part in the Conference on matters relating to wool, as set out in above-mentioned telegram, and would be glad to learn as early as possible whether it is necessary that the two representatives be appointed immediately. This can be done if necessary, but as it has been arranged for a large Conference of wool-growing interests to be held in Wellington on 18th August, it might be more satisfactory to wool growers if the selection of representatives were made by that Conference, if time permits.On 6th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following reply to the above : The Minister of Munitions thinks that no great inconvenience would result from a fortnights delay in appointing two representatives of the New Zealand Wool Growers.
