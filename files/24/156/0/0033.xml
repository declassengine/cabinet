GREAT BRITAIN.Trade Depression. The following paragraph is taken from the Ministry of Labour Special Weekly Report on Unemployment for the week ending 3rd December : The depression in the industries previously commented upon continues, and no general improvement is expected until next spring. The position in the textile, wholesale clothing, and boot and shoe industries is reported to be -worse than for many years past.Unemployment. This paragraph is taken, from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 11th December: The unemployment position continues to cause grave anxiety, and the failure in many cases of particular industries to recover from the effects of industrial disputes indicates the general state of trade depression. The Labour Joint Commission, of Inquiry, who arrived in Dublin on the 30th November, have continued their activities in Ireland during the week. Generally speaking, public opinion is concentrated upon the two questions of Ireland and unemployment. The conference of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation on the 1st December, which endorsed an amalgamation scheme for the unions, affiliated to the Federation, who cater for dock labour, is important, ancl a feature of considerable interest is the apparently spontaneous development of an active organisation among unemployed ex-service men. in. London.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.: &quot;:&quot; The Sultan. Lord Allenby reported on 13th December [No. 1161] that great preparations -were made for a visit which the Sultan paid to Mansurah two days earlier, and that his reception was enthusiastic, even better than that which he received at Damaahour. The extremists liadjnade an effort to influence local opinion against his Majesty and to deter the notables from being present.&apos; Lord Allenby regarded these happenings as an indication that the people were grateful for what we were doing to improve economic conditions ancl appreciative of the interest the Sultan is taking in them.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xxxii, p. 4.] On 0th December the Viceroy reported [No. 223] that beyond slight sniping near Sarwakai there was no change in the Waziristan situation. Should the Wana Waziris not give full compliance with our terms, or clearly demonstrate that they were endeavouring to do so, it had been decided to continue operations on 16th December. On the other hand, if they complied in full, the proposed march on Wana would not be undertaken,, but until the submission of the Waziris was satisfactorily established, troops would remain at Sarwakai.Mission to Kabul [13.ICR., xxxii, p. L] Replying to the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 25th November, the Secretary of State in a telegram [3SS0] &quot;dated 8th December, expressed the misgivings of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the proposals for the despatch of a mission to Kabul. The risk of misrepresentation at the hands of the Afghans, and the opportunity which the presence of the mission in Kabul might afford Turks and Bolsheviks of embroiling the Afghans with us, were objectionable features.   There was the further risk that, as the Amir had withheld any reply to our
definite requests, our hands might be forced into accepting any concession, rather than the admission of failure to secure any agreement. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government did not feel justified in overriding the deliberate judgment of the Government of India in a matter which was so peculiar to its functions, and -accordingly authorized the Viceroy to accept the Ami/s invitation, if he still adhered to his recommendations.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on the 5th and 12th December: I. (5th December).-Interest centres mainly in (I) the attitude of the students to non-co-operation ; and (2) the elections. Details of (I) are sent in the Education Department telegram, and we only cite the Leader&apos;s estimate of the effect of GandhPs visit to Benares: &quot; The visit has not produced a.cataclysm. According to present information not many students are prepared to follow him into the wilderness. We would be surprised if even 5 or 6 per cent, leave it. None, so far, has actually left it.&quot; The paper congratulates Maiaviya, the professors, and especially the students, on resisting Gandhi&apos;s appeals. A strike amongst the students of the Engineering-College, Benares, has also collapsed, the students recognizing their mistake and apologizing to the principal. At Allahabad, where 2,000 students were addressed by Gandhi, Professor Jevons made a speech on the other side, and (? only) 30 or 40 students signified their adherence to non-co-operation m response to Gandhi&apos;s invitation.2. Elections.-Much attention has been devoted in the press to the elections, the numbers recording votes varying greatly from some 8 per cent, in Bombay to GO per cent, in Lucknow, where the contest was very keen reported to be brisk in Allahabad, fair in Benares, and varying from 52 to 48 per cent, in Madras. In the Central Provinces, the Chief Commissioner called for fresh nominations for seven -non-Mohamedan constituencies owing to the absence of candidates. Dadabhoy and Ivhaparde (? reported omitted) to be elected, by large majorities to the Council of State. The Extremists have made great efforts to frustrate the elections by putting up men of straw in some places, by threatening a social boycott, and by rowdyism and hooliganism at the polls. In Lahore the difficulties of candidates are (? represented as serious owing to the determined efforts of the extremists, but the reports of the polling, so far as seen, indicate that a fair proportion voted. Jhansi (United Provinces), where Chiutamaui was elected to the United Provinces Council,&quot; has been the scene of feverish activity on the part of the non-co-operators, who gave out that Gandhi instructed his followers to oppose Cbiutainani and vote for his opponent. Gandhi, to whom Cliintamani wired, denied this. Later, at Benares, he urged the excommunication of those who took part in the elections.In Madras it is reported that bands of students with non-co-operation posters paraded the streets; and attempted to offer organized resistance, but not apparently with much success. Mrs. Besant issued a manifesto calling on all national Home hide Leagues and Liberals and moderates to vote for each other&apos;s candidates in all elections, as being parties standing for reform against revolution, co-operation, against non-co-operation, for freedom against tyranny, and for the congresses of 1885 to 1918 (Bombay) against the new congresses of (Delhi) 1920.3. Gandhi has been touring the United Provinces, and Colonel Wedgwood has issued a manifesto. The former at Allahabad declared the Government established in India to be satanic, urged the boycott of schools and colleges, and admitted his non-success with students, denouncing their failure to keep their promises of with-drawal from the institutes ; from Bombay reports of his recent tour in that presidency indicate his disappointment at the poor success attending his schools, campaign, in spite of the establishment in various places of national schools and colleges. Colonel Wedgwoods manifesto encourages the movement for swarij, but. expresses disapproval of non-co-operation, especially the refusal to seek election to the Councils, though attaching blame for the movement rather to the &quot; 0&apos;Dwyer &quot;&apos; school and the extremists of bureaucracy than to Indian extremists. He points out the risks and clangers of non-co-operation, which is a campaign of hate, and involves coercion of Indians who co-operate ; urges a definite time limit for Home Rule, the formation of a territorial army, and with companionship based on these conditions, co-operation with the Government, and asks the Nagpur congress to put forward a suggestion for conference on those lines under the presidentship of the Prince of Wales.
4. Lajpat Rai is taking an increasingly prominent part in the public agitation-To-day^ press telegrams announce that he will preside over the All-India College students&apos; conference at Nagpur in Christmas week, also that he will preside over the the All-India rail.waymen&apos;s conference at Bombay on 14th to 16th January, which will be the inauguration of a central organization to improve the condition of railwaymen all over India.5. Punjab. Apart from schools and elections, emphasis is laid on the estab-lishment of panchayats to take the place of ordinary courts and the Lfoyeott of recruitment for the army service in Mesopotamia aud foreign goods. The rural population appears little affected, but in parts of the Jullundur division, where are a number of returned emigrants of doubtful loyalty, the situation is regarded with some anxiety. The application of the Seditious Meetings Act is reported to have had a markedly good, effect in districts where it has been applied. Steps are being taken to serve notices under the Defence of India Rules against two prominent Sikh agitators, and to prosecute another. The Lieutenant-Governor has toured through the Mohamedan districts of Attock,. Mianwali, Dera Ghazi Khan and Muzzaffargarh, and was received everywhere with spontaneous expressions of loyalty and no dissentient note. Sardar Mangal Singh, editor of the Akali, was convicted yesterday at Lahore, under sections 124(a) and 153, Indian Penal Code, for a series of seditious articles, on non-co-operation, and sentenced to three years&apos; rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1,000.United Provinces. The politicians are active, but Gandhi, as stated above, was unsuccessful at Benares, and no action is now to be* taken till meeting of the court,, about the middle of December. Attempts are being made to spread non-co-operation among the villages, but, in the opinion of the officers touring in districts, they are shallow aud unreal, and the people know nothing about it and do not care. The general feeling is that Gandhi and his party have lost influence through the campaigns against the schools. Racial feeling is still strong, and non-cooperation ardently pushed by the Independent newspaper, Allahabad, which is effectively countered by the Leader.- At the Aligarh meeting, attended by 125 gentlemen from different parts of the Province, under the presidency of Nawab Muzammihdlah, a resolution was unanimously passed establishing a reform league with a view to co-operation with the Government in political and educational matters and to start propaganda immediately. Raza Ali, long time a member of the United Provinces Legislative-Council, congratulates the Aligarh trustees in a long letter ; he says that the Ali brothers will soon realize the-blunder of enlisting narrow-minded maulvis, and asks the students to have nothing to do with pretentious impostors and humbugs.Bengal. There are signs of friction among the Bengal agitators. The movement for the boycott of schools, though spreading to Chittagong and Tipperah, appears to be spent, and the situation improving. Strikes, continue,&apos; the ,most serious being a strike at iron works at Kulti, which, first reported to be of political significance, has just been settled, and the strike in the Ilowrah mills, at which looting is reported aud some Europeans have been stoned. The European Association is again offending Indian sentiment by announcing its intention of having a memorial to General Dyer, suitably (? word omitted) and forwarded to him.Bihar and Orissa. The agitation in schools and colleges to persuade the students to withdraw, is vigorous, but the movement has received very little support from parents and guardians. Gandhi is now making an extensive tour in the province, where he has considerable personal influence on account of the Champaran connexion.Delhi.-Reported to be none the worse for a fortnight of almost ceaseless oratory.-The ulema&apos;s conference was not much of a success, but a resolution enjoining non-co-operation, especially in. military matters, to issue as a fatwa, was signed by all the ulema present. These, however, are mainly local men, whose names do not carry any great weight. A, political, conference, presided over by Mohamed Ali, was an admitted failure. At a zenana meeting the British Government was characterized by Gandhi, Shaukat Ali and Kitchlew as devilish and fiendish, and contributions in shape of ornaments were raised. National schools make little headway, and other schools are unaffected. Caliphate receipts, bearing partial resemblance to rupee notes, had been sold in Delhi, to the face value of over 4,000 rupees. Dr. Ansarr has been elected president of the forthcoming session of the All-India moslem league at Nagpur.    Maulana Mahmud at Hasan of Deeband died on 30th November at
Delhi, where ho came to preside over the ulema conference. Late news has come from the North-West Frontier Province that the political situation, which deteriorated -owing to Colonel Wedgwood&apos;s visit, is now quiet again.Burma. Swami Shradanaud is louring and preaching non-co-operation, with a. probable result of strengthening anti-Government feeling among Indians.Two Bui-man newspapers have been warned, under section 153(a), Indian Penal Code, for publishing seditious articles. Newspaper reports as to the fate of the Burma reforms scheme led to the accentuated expression of impatience. One paper suggests it will not be-enough even if Burma gets the Indian scheme. Caliphate rupee receipts are in wide circulation and may lead to ignorant people being deceived, but the law officers advise that there is no case for prosecution under any section of the Penal Code.General. The political situation continues to be easier, and the outlook generally improved.   .II. (12th December). Bengal. There is a beginning of dissension among the&quot; supporters of the Caliphate propaganda and the iion-co-operat(ors). The enthusiasm -of Marwaris, formerly among Gaudbfs strongest supporters, has cooled. There is friction among the supporters of the Caliphate committee, with complaints of the maladministration of the, Caliphate funds. An influential, maulana, Abu Bakar, issued -a proclamation&apos; supporting non-co-operation, but the Hindu extremists are faint-hearted, and, while desirous to reverse the policy at Nagpur, are unlikely to be successful, though we hear that C. .R. Das and B. C. Pal, who have been in consulta-tion with Lajpat Rai and Malaviya, will put up a light for a more practical programme of non-co-operation than that of Gandhi. It will probably avoid the schools and law courts, and concentrate more on swadeshi goods. The secession of the Bengali nationalists is possible if the congress confirms GanclhFs programme. The.rupee receipts issued by the Caliphate committee met with less success than was anticipated, but developments require careful watching. Notes have obtained certain amount of circulation, probably forced, at Delhi and elsewhere. Agitators have been active organizing meetings especially to reduce the number of Mohamedan -candidates and to secure small polls. The position in regard to the schools and colleges is satisfactory, but the Bengal students are excitable. A. leaflet published in Dacca declared that anyone trying to become a member of the Council, or voting, would thereby sever connexion with Islam. The secretary of the Dacca Caliphate committee is being prosecuted under section 171 (Pj of the Indian Penal Code. We have not yet received official reports, but according to press accounts polling was fairly brisk in Calcutta, particularly in the non-Mohamedan constituencies. Labour unrest continues.Madras. Interest is concentrated chiefly on the elections. The advocates of non--co-operation and candidates have both made great efforts. An illiterate coolie&apos;was returned unopposed to the Mohamedan seat in. the Legislative Council for South Kanara in Madras. There has been some stone throwing but no serious trouble, -and there are no reports of disturbances elsewhere in the Presidency. According to press reports the polling in the Madras urban constituencies was distinctly good, varying from about 40 to 70 per cent.; in the rural constituencies the percentage was naturally lower, about 15 to 40; polling in some areas being hampered by floods. The lock-out at the Buckingham mills continues. Judgment has been delivered in the High Court on an application for an interim injunction by the -company against Wadia and others on the ground that the defendants had been -conspiring to injure the plaintiffs by inducing workmen to break contracts; a temporary injunction had already been granted, and in the judgment the injunction was continued pending the hearing of the suit.Bombay. Unofficial reports calculate that from 10 to 15 per cent, of the electors voted. There was a general lack of organization and zeal on the part of the candidates. One district magistrate reports that cyclists were sent round by non-co-operators to tell the voters that the elections were stopped, and the rumour widely spread that tbe object of the elections (was) to quadruple the land revenue, assess-ment. There has been some success in the campaign against a few schools. An attempt was made to reduce to a fiasco the Anjuman-i-Islam school prize distribution, at which the Governor attended. Volunteers were posted to turn back scholars and -visitors.  Placards denouncing the function were distributed, and posted up around
0the institution.   Nevertheless the function was successful.   At a subsequent counter-meeting, Patel presiding, a resolution was passed condemning the action of the office-bearers of the school for inviting the Governor to the prize distribution, and urging their social boycott.   The central Caliphate committee is believed to-have prevailed upon the gravediggers in big Mohamedan cemeteries to refuse to bury a title-holder or a co-operator..  Bands of mill-hands have been led through the streets persuading the vendors of teashops to close, and in consequence of the-. Mohamedan revivalist movement a mob of several hundreds visited the liquor shops and molested Moslem customers.   Bomanji described Gandhi as the &quot; Zaghlul Pasha., of India.&quot;   There is considerable labour unrest.   Baptista announced the intention, of starting a messenger service in Bombay from 1st December, ex-postal men to be-employed.   It is doubtful whether a local messenger service will pay its way.Bihar and Orissa, Vigorous agitation has been directed against the Roman Catholic schools. For the moment some success has been secured ; a number of. boys were influenced, but the action has caused a distinct hardening in the minds, of&quot; responsible persons against this agitation. We have not yet had report of the results of GandhPs tour; but he and his followers have been making speeches in the usual style. The effect is likely to lie ephemeral. Gandhi had an interview with Hasan Iman and made misleading references to the subject in a speech at Patna, stating that Hasan Iman favoured non-co-operation, and would join the movement as soon as the bar was removed on violence. Hasan Iman has written to the SearcliLiglit denying this statement, and denouncing non-co-operation as practically unsound, politically unwise, ancl suicidal for students. He told Gandhi he was opposed to the move-ment in its entirety. Non-co-operation could not continue to be non-violent. Swami Biswanand has been active in the coalfields and endeavouring to form a labour union-and then to secure increased wages, the aim being a minimum wage Re. 1. 8 a. day. Two strikes occurred, but the men have now returned to work. The Railway Board has-received alarmist reports of a. possible general strike of the coalfields between the 12th and the 22nd. Precautions are being taken in consultation with the India Mining Association and Local Governments. Miners&apos; wages are being raised somewhat.   Miners have no organization or funds to support a long strike.Central Provinces. Extremist leaders are touring the province to collect funds for the ensuing congress. Practical non-co-operation is making very slow progress, though unrest is developing among schools at Jubbulpur. Gandhi is shortly expected in the province, and further efforts will be made against the schools, but education authorities anticipate only a temporary effect. Voting in elections has undoubtedly been affected by the non-co-operation movement. In some constituencies the extremists secured the election of men of straw, ancl the new council will contain several unsuitable members. Khaparde, in. spite of persecution by non-co-operators,, was elected to the Council of State.Assam. A manifesto condemning non-co-operation has been published in Assam, the signatories including the leading men of Sibsagar and Lakhimpur. and the four-great abbots of the Assam valley. The elections are not eliciting much interest. An attempt to start a madrassah at Sylhet in opposition to the Government madrassah. has not made much progress.Punjab. The election returns up to the 7th instant show that in rural con-stitnencies the polling averaged about 30 per cent, of the electors on the rolls.. But voting in the urban constituencies so far reported, and particularly in Lahore and Amritsar, has been a failure as the result of interference by organized bands of city hooligans employed by the local non-co-operative leaders. In Lahore, voters, candidates and officials were commonly intimidated, and in some cases assaulted, one seriously. One honorary worker at the poll was subjected to four hours&apos; insults from a crowd of 8,000, in spite oi the protection of armed police. He ancl the police inspectors escorting him were stoned on leaving the booth, and a crowd attacking his residence was fired on by his son, four persons being slightly wounded. Firing-excited the crowd, who tried to break into the house. The timely arrival of police ancl non-co-operation leaders prevented further trouble, Kitchlew taking the crowd away ancl holding an indignation meeting. We have asked the Local Governments to report the action taken against the intimidators, and have pointed out the necessity of prompt prosecution under sections 143 and 171(c), Indian Penal Code. A report received from a Sikh police officer states that feeling in the Punjab is very bitter, specially the tendency of poor people to insult and humiliate the rich.   He recommends-
the formation of a moderate Sikh association among the Sikhs, and steps are now taken by Sunder Singh and other influential Sikhs to start daily Sikh papers on the lines of the Leader of Allahabad, with the view to impress on Sikhs the necessity of the for-mation of a moderate Sikh association. Thirteen professors of Khalsa College, Amritsar, have resumed work in consequence of the withdrawal of Government control. The Tilak school of politicians has been established at Lahore under the directorship of Lajpat Rai, to which Colonel Wedgwood has subscribed Its. 500 in a letter eulogizing its institution : objects to include the training of political workers with the object apparently of establishing a training for the non-co-operating students of the Punjab, as Mohamed Alis National University at Aligarh will for the United Provinces.Delhi. There was an unpleasant development this week at the funeral of Khan Bahadur Manlvi Abdul Ahacl, trustee of Aligarh College, who has always been a strong supporter of the Government. The family was warned not to take the corpse to June Musjid for the usual prayers. On the way to the burial ground the funeral party met a mob led by volunteer organizers and was forced to take the corpse back to the house. Abuse was hurled at the deceased as a title-holder and the cpiestion was raised as to wdiether he could be buried in a Mohamedan burial ground. The relatives appealed to the authorities and police were taken to spot. Eventually an announcement was made by tin? relatives that the deceased had repented on his death-bed and on this purely suppositions assumption the obstructors professed themselves willing to assist in the funeral, which took place. En route, intimidation of title-holders and voters, was also carried on, and especially a mob collected at the house of the loyal Rai Bahadur, reported to have died, and refused to disperse. The chief persons responsible for the rowdyism at Manlvi Abdul Ahad&apos;s funeral are being prosecuted under section 297, Indian Penal Code. With a view to check this hooliganism and the dangerous extension of the volunteer move-ment, which woidd lead to serious rioting and conflict with the police, and to restore confidence amongst the large body of well-wishers of the Government and prominent men, the Chief Commissioner, with our full approval, has extended to Delhi part 2 of the Indian Criminal baw Amendment Act, 1908, and declared unlawful the four volunteer associations founded this year. He has (? also) with our sanction applied the Seditious Meetings Act to Delhi for a further period of six. months. (? SinceY 28th October, when the previous application of the Act to Delhi expired, there has been a growing abuse of public speech and meetings of a grossly seditious character are being held to encourage disloyalty and to intimidate loyal citizens. We have indicated to the Chief Commissioner the importance we attach to prompt prosecution in all cases of intimidation. The election was turned into a farce by the intimidation of candidates and voters, and the return of a sweetmeat seller, who paraded the streets on a donkey. No prominent man takes the lead in Delhi, and the developments now reported were chiefly the work of city hooligans -who have got out of hand and were terrorizing respectable citizens. Action is being taken under the two Acts mentioned above, and the puosecutious will, we hope, have salutary effect.United Provinces. In Agra some voters were roughly handled, and rubbish was thrown at respectable voters and superintendents of the police. The rowdy crowd consisted of students of a low caste and of Mohamedan riffraff shouting &quot; Mahatma Gandhiji Ki Jai.&quot; The Leader of the 9th instant vigorously denounces the disgraceful exploits of non-co-operators at Agra and Meerut, also at Cawnpore, where hartal was enforced to commemorate the death of Muhmud Hasan. The Leader says: &quot;Non-violent non-co-operation has begun to emerge into violent non-co-opsration despite the saintly advice of Mr. Gandhi.&quot;Generally in the United Provinces polling was fair, and especially in Lucknow,. and no disturbances are reported elsewhere. From Agra and (? word omitted) sensational reports received of disorderliness at the elections show how imperfect is Gandhi&apos;s pretended control. He issued a message hoping that no voter would go to polls on 30th, but that there would be no undue interference with those wishing to vote. The events at Lahore, Delhi and Agra aie an ironical commentary on this message, described by the Independent as the &quot; voice of the uatiohs soul.&quot; The poor polling reported from some places will be claimed as a triumph for non-co-operation, though this is in many places largely due to apathy.Burma There has been considerable uurest among the students&apos; (&apos;? community) in Rangoon, of which details are separately reported by the Education Department. The Local Government ascribes the situation to a preaching Indian agitator, Swami
THE DOMINIONS.Communications Conference: On 7th December the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governors-General, of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa -that tho Ambassador at Washington had reported that the place and date of the main communications conference would probably be discussed at the final meeting of the preliminary conference at Washington. The place would probably be Paris, and the date was not likely to be earlier than June next.On 8th December the following reply was received from the Governor-General of New Zealand: The Government of New Zealand desire to. appoint as their representative at the January conference the High Commissioner for New Zealand in London, and a communication to this effect has been sent to the High Commissioner. My Prime Minister presumes that Sir James Allen will duly be informed when once a date has been fixed for the informal discussion of the matters assigned.On 17th December the Governor-General of Australia reported that arrangements-were being made by the Commonwealth representative to take part in the preliminary discussion of British and Dominion representatives in regard to matters of common interest,International llydrogro.phic Bureau [B.E.R. xxxii., p. 9]. On 10th December the Governor-General of Canada informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Government of Canada did not desire at this stage to take any steps to become -associated with the work of the International Hyclrographic Bureau.On 13th December the Governor-General of New Zealand reported that the Government of New Zealand did not desire to be represented at present.And on the following day the Governor-General of South Africa telegraphed that his Ministers considering that the small amount of shipping tonnage registered in the Union did not warrant active association with the bureau., Memorial Plaque for the Mercantile Marine. On 14th December the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and to the Governor of Newfoundland as follows :-His Majesty the King has sanctioned the presentation of a memorial plaque and scroll, similar to those issued in connexion with the combatant services, to the next-of-kin of those members of the mercantile marine who lost their lives through enemy action during the war. Detailed regulations governing the award will be sent out as soon as possible.   Tt is proposed that in order to secure distribution on uniform linesSraddhanaud, and does not regard the (&apos;? episode) as a serious political manifestation.It is reported from Rangoon that the editor and publisher of; the Rangoon Hail, Halms (? word omitted), and charged under section 153a, Indian Penal Code:General. With the exception of the unpleasant development of hooliganism, and the social boycott successfully adopted in some quarters, the situation is unchanged and the non-co-operation movement is certainly not gaining strength with educated classes. Colonel Wedgwood, in an interview in Calcutta, condemned the non-co-operation movement as hateful and wished it at end and hoped the Nagpur conference would convince Gandhi of its wickedness. We have received the full text of the opinion of the Advocate-General, Bombay, advising against the prosecution of Gandhi. Andrews has returned to the charge on tbe policy of segregation adopted in East Africa and alleged that the decision (? would be) insulting to Indian self-respect. Attention has been drawn to a recent statement in gandhis paper Young India (? from its) Baghdad correspondent, describing, -the inauguration of Gandhi&apos;s non-co-operation campaign and protesting against the action of the military authorities in enrolling men of the Indian labour corps into lighting units. The facts are not correctly stated, as only ex-soldiers in labour corps have been invited to* enlist as volunteers in battalions, but the matter is of considerable political signi-significance. The recruitment of the military labour corps was only agreed to by the Government of India in April last with reluctance, as military needs were predominant in Mesopotamia and on the understanding that there should.be no labour recruitment in India by civil authorities for Mesopotamia.
the issue should be made from a central office here under the supervision of the Board of Trade, but the Board trust that, as regards next-of-kin of members of the mercantile marine who at the&apos;: fibre of death were ordinarily resident in the dominions,&apos; the dominion Governments will co-operate in ascertaining the names of those: entitled and checking applications.Clasps for Medals [B.E.R., xxxi, p. 7].-On 9th.December the Governor-General of South Africa informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Ministers concurred in the proposals made in the latter&apos;s telegram of 10th November.And on the 12th December the Governor-General of New Zealand reported that the Government of New Zealand suggested that the period for clasps for the mercantile marine medal should be limited to service in European danger, zones, and concurred in the proposals regarding clasps to British war medals.Income Tax [B.E.R., xxxi, p. Sj. The Governor-General of Australia sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies: -The United Kingdom proposals for the relief of double taxation within the Empire have been submitted to , the royal commission now enquiring into Commonwealth taxation, and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia has suspended the consideration of the question until the receipt of the commission^ recommendations.On 14th December the Governor-General of South Africa reported that his Mhristers had informed him that, as the Union income-tax law did not impose double taxation, they did not at present contemplate any relief measures.Imperial Wireless Scheme [B.E.R., xxiv, p. 7]. On 10th December the Governor-General of Canada telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies with reference to the latteEs telegram of 11th August, as follows: In the Dominion of Canada wireless telegraphy is under the control of the Naval Service Department, and they report that the only point in which Canada is interested would appear to be recommendation No. 5, i.e., that, subject to a decision in the conference between the Canadian and the Imperial Governments, similar communication should be established by valve stations between England and Canada ; my- Government is quite prepared to discuss this proposal with the imperial authorities.Proposed Agreement xoith the Government of Germany regarding the Restitution of Property. The following telegram was sent on 16th December by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand aud South Africa and to the Governor of Newfoundland : -In order to facilitate the immediate restitution of British property at present held in Germany, in return for certain concessions as to German property under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is proposed to enter into an agreement with the Government of Germany, to be signed not later than 2Sth December, of which the following is a summary: Article.I. The departments established in the United Kingdom and Germany for the settlement of matters relating to property will imme-diately appoint representatives in Berlin and London who will constitute offices there. Article II. The property of British nationals in Germany, which has been subjected to exceptional war measures but not completely liquidated, shall be restored imme-diately on application, iu accordance with the provisions of Article 297 (a), free of charges for liquidation, administration, &amp;c. The remainder of the article is concerned with details as to the method of application. Article III. Where prohibition or restriction exists upon the exportation from Germany of British property detained by Germany during the war, a licence to export such property, free of all conditions, shall be issued by the competent German authority.

with the vise of British consular officials are admissible to canada exempt from the head tax of $500. Within recent months the practice has grown up and is now wide-spread of issuing these certificates with endorsement of British consular officers to Chinese labourers, and as a natural consequence, the Canadian law is being evaded in a Wholesale way. Owing to the labour conditions existing in British Columbia, and the feeling of the residents of that province, it is imperative that measures should be taken to put an end to the irregular practices now prevailing. My Ministers desire to urge on the Imperial Government the desirability of instructing by telegraph all British consular officers in China to postpone endorsing certificates as above mentioned until such time as an officer of the Canadian Immigration Department has an opportunity toqnuceed to China to investigate the whole situation. My Ministers ask that the Government of Canada may be informed by telegraph of any decision arrived at in this matter.British-American Nickel Corporation.   On 16th December the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of Canada as follows: Negotiations have been proceeding between Dr. S. Eyde, a Minister in the Norwegian diplomatic service, aud His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the proposed reconstruction of the British-American Nickel Corporation. Substantial progress towards a solution of the difficulties has been made. The principles and conditions on which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to concur in the reconstruction scheme have been agreed between Dr. Eyde and His Majesty&apos;s Government and will be communicated to the Canadian Government by mail. Dr. Eyde is leaving for Canada probably on 17th December. In view of his official position and the importance of tils mission to Norwegian interests, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad if the Canadian. Government would grant him every possible consideration and facility. He speaks in the first instance on behalf of the Norwegian financial interests connected with the British-American Nickel Corporation,-but these interests are so large and the present financial and industrial position of Norway so difficult that the Norwegian Government have taken the unusual step of authorizing a Minister in the diplomatic service to represent them. Under instructions from the Norwegian Government the Norwegian Minister in London has lent Dr. Eyde the full weight.of his support.Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs :  1. According to the preliminary estimate issued by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, the value of the field crops of Canada for 1920 was $1,636,665,000, or $184,227,000 more than the 19.1.9 total, and $.264,000,000 in excess of that for 1918. The wheat crop is estimated to be worth $536,730,000; and the oats $307,1.21,000.2. Speaking at the annual meeting of the Bank of Montreal, Sir Vincent Meredith suggested the advisability of a credit corporation to finance foreign trade, and Sir Frederick Williams-Taylor, the general manager, said: &quot;There is no reason for dismay over our national outlook, but there is every reason for sober thought while we take stock of our resources and prospects.&quot;3, The attitude of the Canadian delegates at the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva is strongly supported by the press of Canada.4. The Canadian Parliament will probably meet during the second week in February. 15. Canada&apos;s coal production this year will be the largest in her experience.AUSTRALIA.Wool [B.E.R., xxi, p. 11].--The following message from his Prime Minister was transmitted by the Governor-General of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 8th December: As no doubt you have known, certain negotiations have been unofficially under way for some time between an executive wool committee in Australia and the Director-General of Raw Materials, London, re the disposal of cany-over wool. This has now taken shape, and has been endorsed by the industry. At a conference held in Melbourne on the 7th December, particulars of which were telegraphed to the Director-General, at which representatives of all branches of the Australian wool industry were 23-4 D
present, the principles embodied;jn; the following.resolution were carried unanimously, and..submitted to me for transmission to&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government. I. approve of the proposal entirely, and I suggest that, the details of the seheme.be worked out between the London officials and the committee on this side. The proposed, scheme includes a provision, that the British. Governments, half of the Australian carry-over wool be sold through the agency of the,proposed ,wool realization association. The following are the resolutions passed at the conference : -- -0) That the principle be accepted that the payment of the balance of profits by the British Imperial Government to Australian wool growers be in cash (if any in hand) and kind, i.e., wool and other assets. e    . N(2) That a British-Australian wool realization association be established for the purpose inter alia to control and dispose of all Australian carry-over wools.. The matter is one of vital importance not only to the wool industry but to Australia generally. It, is one, too, of extreme urgency. If I am to avoid a crisis immediate action, is necessary. Lventure to hope, therefore, that the principles wdll be adopted and the details be settled without delay.Flour. -On, Sth December the following message from the Prime Minister was transmitted by the Governor-General to,the Secretary of State for the Colonies.:-As advised, the royal commission on wheat supplies will not consider the purchase- of Australian flour although interested in American and Canadian : this attitude is income pi-ehensible. While not, asking any concession I think our industries should, be put at least on a footing of equality with American, particularly as purchases from the. hitter aggravate English exchange, difficulties, while purchases from Australia will tend to equalise the exchange rates between England and Australia and thus materially assist British exporters and traders. ,The Secretary of State, on 17th December, replied to this as follows : The royal commission on wheat supplies inform me that they have not made any purchases of North American flour since early in October, and do not propose to make any further-purchases of flour from this or any other source. Flour may be imported into the United Kingdom on private account free of any restriction as regards the selling price. Particulars of purchases&apos; for import on private account have to be furnished to the royal commission to enable them to judge of the extent to which the United Kingdom requirements in regard to breadstuffs are being met by private trade.Certificates of Origin [B.E.1P,\ xv, p. 6]. With reference to the telegram of 1st April from the Secretary of State, the Governor-General on 20th December telegraphed as follows: The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be glad if His Majesty&apos;s Government will permit its consular representative to continue to issue certificates of origin for goods imported from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, Finland, Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia, and the late territories of Austria-Hungary, now incorporated in Italy and the Serb-Croat-Slovene kingdom, until the embargo on imports from Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey ancl Bulgaria are removed by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia.NEW ZEALAND.Freight Rates [B.E.R., xxxi, p. 10].  On 10th December the Secretary, of State for the Colonies sent the following reply to the telegram sent on 17th November by the Governor-General of New Zealand : The new rate of freight on cheese between Newr Zealand and England is not fixed by His Majesty&apos;s Government but is quoted by shipowners for the carriage of the new season&apos;s cheese which is in. the hands of the private trade, holds being-released from requisition for the purpose. I understand from the Food Controller that the shipowners&apos; case for an increase is as follows: First, since the old rate was fixed the charter rate has been raised from 132s. 6d. to .144s. as from 1st March last. Secondly, shipowners&apos; claim when the charter rate was fixed it was not their under-standing that they were to pay out of the charter rate the heavy cost of conveying dairy produce to the ports. Thirdly, the charter rate is paid by the Government in respect of the total cubic capacity of the ship, ancl the Government bears the liability for dead freight)&apos;but in case of holds released for cheese, that liability falls on the shipowner and is met by an increased rate per lb. With reference to the last sentence of your telegram, I understand that the High Commissioner for NeAv Zealand is taking up the general question of freight rates with the imperial, shipping committee.
Armenia. On 8th Decemberthe. Governor-General of New Zealand reported that the Government,of New Zealand wouhl acquiesce in any.decision arrived at by His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard , to the resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League of Nations in connexion with Armenia.SOUTH AFRICA.Assets of Enemy Companies.- On 4th October the officer administering the Government of South Africa sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the subject of enemy assets of companies registered or mainly operating in the Union : My Ministers recognize that the removal of assets from normal trustee might prejudice the case now sub judice in the United Stales, but they would be glad in view of the urgency of the matter to be informed when the case will be heard and when a further reply may be expected to my telegrams of 3rd duly. The Union custodian is about to dispose of the balance of enemy assets; and complication and confusion must arise unless all enemy holdings in individual companies can be disposed of as a whole. Unless purchasers can be assured that they are acquiring the whole enemy interest, thus eliminating all such interests from companies, oilers tendered will probably be prejudiced. In order to overcome this difficulty, and pending agreement between the Imperial and the Union Governments on the general question of enemy shares and proceeds obtained from sale outside, the Union Ministers suggest and urge strongly that in the case of companies registered in the Union the Imperial Government should forth-with cause the release of the balance of such shares now in the hands of and still unsold by the Public Trustee, thus enabling the Union custodian to dispose of all -enemy assets in such companies. As regards companies registered in Great Britain but operating in South Africa, the Ministers suggest that the Public Trustee should dispose of all enemy assets, and that the. Union custodian should for this purpose release immediately from control the shares of such, concerns now within his juris-diction. The Ministers make this latter suggestion on the assumption that the policy of the Imperial Government is to dispose of all such enemy assets which will ensure in all concerns operating within the Union, a uniform.policy in this respect.The Ministers suggest further that, pending an agreement bet-ween the two Governments, the Public Trustee and. the Union custodian should, in connexion with the disposal of these assets which are subject to this discussion between the Imperial And Union Governments be requested to open and keep a special account. To this the Secretary of State replied as follows on 10th December : Your telegram of 4th October has been carefully considered. The importance of the adoption of a common policy with regard to the. disposal of the enemy assets in question is fully realized here, especially in view of the difficulties which may be encountered in disposing of large blocks of shares&apos; in companies at a reasonable figure. This aspect of the matter has been the subject of discussion in the press, which indicates considerable uneasiness in the London market on the subject. It is, of course, in the interest of the Public Trustee here, as well as the Union custodian, that a proper price should be obtained for the shares with which they are respectively concerned, and the Public Trustee desires to &quot;facilitate as far -as possible the disposal of the balance of enemy holdings, but the question of the best means of proceeding requires careful consideration. In this connection the Board of Trade and the Public Trustee feel much concern as to certain provisions -of sections 3 to 5 of the Union Proclamation 148 of 1920. Information in possession of the Public Trustee suggests that the Government of the Union of South Africa may contemplate the issue of new documents of title under section 3. Grave commercial difficulties, which the existence of duplicate documents of title would -create, will be appreciated, and the Board of Trade would be glad to learn whether -and to what extent the Union custodian is causing the issue of such documents and to what extent the provisions of section 5 are being put into force with regard to companies incorporated .in the United Kingdom. It will be realized that shares in such companies and all shares in bearer form in physical possession here are subject to the charge in the United Kingdom imposed by the Treaty of Peace Order, 1919, and within the jurisdiction of the Public Trustee. Further questions requiring -consideration relate to shares already vested in the Public Trustee, shares subject to a specific lien or charge in the United Kingdom and shares to which documents of -title are still outside British jurisdiction entirely.   In view of the importance and the
the intricacy, of. the questions the Board of Trade suggest that the speediest and best method of disposing of them and reaching a settlement satisfactory to both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the Union of South Africa would be for a personal discussion to be arranged with the Union custodian and hope that vour Ministers may see their way to authorize the Custodian to visit the United Kingdom for this purpose. Meanwhile it is earnestly hoped that no action will be taken which would tend to conflict with the jurisdiction of the Public Trustee as the United Kingdom custodian.. - Question oj a South African Republic, The following telegram was sent by BeutePs agent from Capetown on 9th December: General Hertzog, the Nationalist leader, speaking at Brandfort in the Orange Free State, declared that although he was firmly convinced that the republican form of government was the only one suitable for South Africa, and although he was convinced that this form of government would one day materialize, it would be nothing-short of folly to proclaim a republic without clue regard being had to all the circum-stances existing at the time being.Mr. Tielmau Boos, one of the leading Nationalists in the Union House of Assembly speaking at a big Nationalist meeting in the town hall at Johannesburg, said that he did not. think it possible for a Butch republic to be raised in South Africa. That was impossible, but what he did say was that it was possible to build up a republic of all sections in the country. They must educate the people, and if it took 200 years, their independence would come about by constitutional means.The Elections. Reuters agent reported as follows from Botchofstroom on llth December: General Smuts speaking here to-day dealt with the election prospects and said that his appeal, had been responded to in a manner which to his mind, was the best thing that had happened during his lifetime in the politics of South Africa. It was thought that there would be a landslide in the South African party and that their &quot; backvelcl&quot; members would go over to tbe Nationalists ; they could take it from him that there was no fear that there would be any large defection, but it would take some time to judge the effect on the Nationalist and Labour parties. He had received many indications that an impression had been made especially amongst the moderate sections of the Nationalists who were beginning to think most seriously of their position and to see more clearly the direction in which things were going. Large sections of the Labour party too were becoming apprehensive of the policy of that party in regard to the nationalization of the mines, property and industries. In conclusion General Smuts stated that tbe result of his appeal was going to be very widespread and the greatest accession of strength to the new party was coming from the unattached voters who were sick of party politics and did not belong to any party at all.South African Politics. Telegraphing from Pretoria on 15th December, ReutePs agent said that the National Federal Council had issued a lengthy manifesto recapitu-lating the Nationalist, conception of the constitutional position, reiterating its insistence on the right to secession, and denying that the, Nationalists had changed their attitude as.regarded independence and secession or that the Nationalists stood for immediate secession, which must be based on the broad basis of the wishes of the people. The manifesto also denied that the Nationalist party was racial, and declared that it welcomed anyone accepting its principles and South Africa as his fatherland.NEWFOUNDLAND.Wireless Communications [B.E.R., xxx, p. 12].-Referring to his telegram of 30th October, the Governor of Newfoundland, on 17th December, sent the following-telegram to the Secretary of State : My Ministers at the Council meeting to-day showed irritation at the delay in the-matter, as,, although it is necessary to obtain the approval of the legislature, they hoped to push on with certain works. My Ministers urge that they are entitled to. know whether there are any definite Imperial interests which would be affected, since they expect a considerable revenue under the new contracts, and are anxious to commence local work pending the receipt of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
