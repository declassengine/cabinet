FIJI.Indian Labourers&apos; Strike. On 20th February the Governor of Fiji reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that all strikers had returned to work at Suva and Rewa and that complete order prevailed.EGYPT.New Hospital, On 28th February Lord Allenby reported [No. 180] that the Egyptian Government had accepted in principle the necessity for building a new 1,200 bed hospital, with a medical school attached, in place of the present Ivasr-el-Aini. It requested that the Royal Institute of British /Architects. should be asked, whether they would consider the nomination of an architect to come to Egypt to act as general consultant and as assessor in the event of a limited competition amongst Egyptian and British architects being instituted. Lord Allenby added that it should be made clear that the proposed consultant would not in any case be.asked to act. as architect.The General Situation. On 3rd February ReuteFs agent telegraphed from Cairo as follows:  - .It would be difficult to imagine a position of affairs more chaotic than that now existing in Egypt, and one more incomprehensible to both Europeans and Egyptians.To a people accustomed to look to and, more than most people, lean on authority, the present position, with a Sultan without; &quot;power,-a High Commissioner absent, a nominated Ministry representing no party and subjected daily to threats and attempts at assassinations, and further the presence in the country of a distinguished Minister of the British Crown as head of a Mission of inquiry, is bewildering to the last degree. The Milner Mission has amassed a vast amount of information, and its members no doubt now have a fairly accurate knowledge of the problems to be solved, but they have been baulked at every turn when they have endeavoured to get in touch with the people of the country, as the boycott decreed by the Nationalists has been rigidly enforced, and thus a free exchange of views between the real people of Egypt and the members of the Commission has so far been frustrated.Considerable uneasiness has been expressed by the British community as a result of the rumours that the jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the Consular Courts in cases of criminal charges against subjects or citizens of European and American States who are entitled to be tried by the laws of their own countries, would be transferred to the Mixed Courts, which would adopt French criminal procedure.This is felt to be a matter of vital importance to the British community, as one of the root principles of British liberty, the writ of habeas corpus, finds no place therein.A strongly worded protest has been drawn up by the unofficial British community, which it is hoped will bring to the mind of the legal member of the Mission that the privileges which have been enjoyed for generations cannot be transferred without considerable opposition on the part of the British, who view with ever-growing-distrust any adventures into the unknown -more especially now that the general trend of Egyptian opinion is increasingly unfriendly to Europeans.INDIA.Viceroy&apos;s Letter to the Amir [B.E.R., x., p. 3]. On 21st February the Viceroy reported [202 S.] that he; had received a reply to his letter to the ;Amir dated 10th February. The Viceroy summarized the reply as follows : The question of the frontier tribes, meaning those called Afghans, and especiady those like the Waziristan tribes, who have come under British control, requires early settlement. The tribes-men, especially the neighbouring Wazirs, being in sympathy with the Mahsuds, are
out for a holy war, but pending a final decision between the two Governments, the Amir is trying to restrain them. This he will be unable to do if the war continues, and the Mahsuds are subjected to great pressure. Early discussion will solve these difficulties. As regards negotiations for a treaty of friendship, the Amir prefers to rely on .tho clear text of the Treaty of Peace, rather than on the result of verbal discussions between Grant and Ali Ahmad Khan. The natural inclination of Afghanistan is to be friendly with Great Britain and with every other- Government, provided her full rights and independence are secured. She would like a permanent treaty of friendship, but some of the tests of friendship required by Grant &quot; are : totally contrary to the independence of our Royal Government.&quot;For instance, the demand that Afghanistan shall not become the focus of Powers hostile to the British. The Afghan Government naturally desires its country to be the focus of advancement. For this reason it first, turned to the British, but fate brought about a misunderstanding. The British could not (sic) have made Afghanistan the focus of friendship for themselves, but missed their opportunity through not understanding the extraordinary kind of exultation, of feeling aroused amongst the Afghans. &quot; The British Government did not show us the warmth of friendship that we should not become the focus for others.&quot; Unless remedies were considered at once, probably the warmth of friendship will turn into coolness.The demand for the expulsion of Indian seditionists cannot be complied with. They are political refugees such as are to be found in every country. As regards the Bolsheviks, during the war with the British, Afghanistan was forced to turn to Russia, and is now obliged to enter into relations with her &quot; for the purpose of protecting the rights (?), especially the Governments of Bokhara and Khiva.&quot;Finally, the Amir shared the Yiceroy&apos;s desire for the removal of difficulties and misunderstandings. He advocated early discussions with the hope that they would end in a permanent treaty of friendship, and had nominated his representatives, awaiting the Viceroy&apos;s selection of time and place of meeting.&quot; Naturally, I consider it proper that friendly discussions and the conclusion of a permanent treaty should take place at the capital of Your Excelleucy&apos;s Government in England, so that no doubt or misgiving may be left, and swear (corrupt group) finally (? on the spot). In order that I may know (? these) verbal discussions have been pioposed with sincere intentions, Your Excellency might stop in a proper manner the hostile movements against the frontier of Afghans.&quot;The foregoing passage is construed by the Afghan envoy to mean that the Amir would like the discussions to clear away misunderstandings, as well as the negotiations for permanent friendship, both to take place in London. It further implies that hostilities against the Waziristan tribes should cease pending the discussions. These points, however, are not regarded as being put forward as definite stipulations.The Viceroy considered the letter temperate on the whole, but remarked on the notable omission of any assurance that Afghanistan would not be used as a focus for Bolshevik activities against India. The Viceroy considered that the letter was intended to make it plain that the Amir had, as yet, come to no definite agreement with the Bolsheviks, and that it was still open to us to outbid them.The Viceroy is proposing to reply to the Amir that he welcomes the idea of discussions to clear away misunderstandings and to pave the way for a treaty of friendship, and that he&apos; has come to the conclusion that Lucknow is the most commodious and convenient place of meeting for such a conference to be held. Arrangements would be made without delay.Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Report. The following report was sent by the Viceroy on 18th February : The third session of the All-India Caliphate Conference met on .16th February at Bombay. There was a large gathering of Moslems and Hindu sympathizers. Mr. Mahomed Chotani, Chairman of the Reception Committee, in the course of his speech pointed out that, in spite of strong representations, no assurance had yet been given that their legitimate demands would be acceded to. The only consolation the Viceroy offered them was that their demands had been adequately placed before the Peace Conference. Moslems hesitated to admit that England had not a decisive voice in the Peace Conference. Which Power, asked the speaker, was pressing the British occupation of Palestine and Mesopotamia? Did any Power compel the British Government to occupy the Holy Places of Islam through, the agency of the Sherif of Mecca, who had violated the sacred traditions of Islam and had thus created suspicion and xinrest in the Moslem world ?   They had every reason to fear that their demands
&quot;could not be properly placed before the Peace Conference by the British delegates until Mesopotamia and Palestine had been evacuated by England. Referring to.the Bolshevik danger he said that there was a risk of the Bolsheviks making the best use -of the situation in which the British, the Allied Powers, and the whole Moslem world would be involved. The only possible way to crush Bolshevism was to make a favourable settlement with Turkey in accordance with the religious sentiments of Moslems. The Hon. Mr. Bhurgri, President, said that the expulsion of Turks from their homes appeared to be a dreadful contingency which might materialize at any moment. In view of the clear rights and definite promises given, Moslems were fully entitled to demand that duo regard should be paid to their interests and beliefs.. In conclusion he said that the decision about the future of Turkey rested entirely with Britain, and she could induce other nations to forgo any annexation of territory belonging to Turkey.The Punjab reports that Jallianvvala Bagh has been acquired for 51 lakhs -for the purchase of a national memorial. The Extremists still attack any supporter of Government, the worst example being the branding as infidels of the Indian Moslem sepoys who fought against the Turks-which has been clone by certain moulvis. The general political situation is, however, easier-, the prospects being better than they have been for ,the last three months.Mpb fired on at Sholapur. On 19th February the Viceroy reported that a mob had become violent at Sholapur (Bombay Presidency) on the evening of .1.6th February and had stoned officers aud men. It was necessary to fire to disperse:,the mob, and there were six casualties among the strikers. All was quiet, when the telegram was sent.Bombay Mill Strikes.   Apparently Bombay has. been quiet since work was resumed, as no report of any further disorders has reached the India Office.The Caliphate Deputation. This deputation reached England on 26th February. The Rupee. On 6th February the A^iceroy telegraphed as follows :  The views of the public have not yet sufficiently crystallized, to enable us to summarize them (? usefully).   So far the Press reports from Calcutta state that the general opinion is favourable.   The report of our Deputy Controller of Currency at Bombay is to the same effect, but we wait further expressions of opinion on this point in view of attitude of the Times of India.   The Pioneer and the Englishman unreservedly welcome the solution.   The fatter congratulates the Secretary of State and the Government of India on putting the policy into effect without hesitation or delay, and remarks that Mr. Dalai would surely not have written his Minority Report if there had been any danger of its adoption.   The Statesman, while fully agreeing with the linking of the rupee to gold, and not definitely objecting to the actual rate adopted, qualifies its acceptance thereof by remarking that the Committee would have done well to have investigated more closely the possible effects on export trade.. It applauds the decision not to allow a sudden rush of gold to India.   The opinion of the Times of India is at present somewhat indefinite.   It describes Dalai&apos;s report as a masterly production, but does not identify (? itself) with his recommendations. It expresses some misgivings as to our ability to maintain the high rate in view of possible heavy remittances home.   It also points out that the (? permanent) fixing of the rate at 2s. gold rests on the fundamental assumption of a prognostication of high world prices, and expresses some doubt of parity (? in Calcutta) when external prices fall, but gives no indication of what alternative policy it would prefer.   It describes the Secretary of State&apos;s announcement as halting between the views of (? the majority) and those of Dalai.   It promises further articles from time to time, and meanwhile&apos; invites correspondence:    The telegraphic summaries of articles in the Madras Mail, the Madras Times and the Hindu, are on the whole favourable.   Sir Fazulbhoy Currimbhoy, who is now in Delhi, says that they haye no apprehension of any deletereous effect on export trade, but will probably oppose the continuance of the Gold Import Act as detrimental to India.   Informal conversations with other non-official members have not as yet disclosed any particular interest on their part in the report.   We wijl report further when the. opinions of the Indian (? vernacular) newspapers have been received, and will&apos; ihdicate-the&apos;&apos;&apos; general ! criticism&apos;-&quot; upon- its expressions of opinion on the part of the public.Telegraphing again on 12th February, he said the full text of the articles in the Madras Mail and the hindu, referred to in the telegram of 6th &quot;February, have since been received.   The Madras Mail welcomes the fixing of the exchange at a high level
and combats the views of the advocates of a low exchange. As regards linking the rupee to gold, it doubts whether the advantages gained are worth the sacrifices of stability in sterling, hut it admits that the Oomrnittee&apos;s policy opens an avenue to stability, and that in the long run it is calculated to lead to a permanent solution of the currency difficulties. The Hindu considers the main recommendations conceived on sound lines, especially the linking of the rupee to gold, and expresses the opinion that a return to a low exchange would be fraught with, very serious consequences. The comments of the Advocate of India (Bombay) are on similar lines, and it congratulates the Committee on framing the report on the only lines which common sense and expediency dictate. Further articles in the Statesman comment on the disapprobation with which the report is said to have been greeted in certain quarters in Bombay, attributing it to a belief cherished in that city in the possibility of controlling the exchange by ingenious devices. The Statesman points out that the change of policy now made, although apparently a desertion of sterling, is in reality the expression of a resolve to remain faithful to the standard to which sterling formerly adhered. As regards the actual rate adopted, its opinion appears somewhat more favourable than that expressed in its previous article referred to in our telegram of the 6th instant, being to the effect that the Committee could not have adopted any other rate consistently with their terms of reference. The Rangoon Times does ,not appear to have fully realized the difference between the sovereign and pound sterling. It draws attention to the anomaly of a difference between the acquisition rate and the legal tender value, and remarks on the incentive to smuggling. The general comments of the Servant of India are on lines similar to those of the article in the Times of India, previously reported. The Leader (Allahabad) does not agree with the criticism that acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations will injure export trade, and remarks that in any case the interests of the Indian consumer should be placed before those of exporters.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Representation at Washington [B.E.R., iv., p. 4j. On 20th February the Governor-General of Canada enquired of the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether the matter of Canadian representation at AVasliington had been taken up with the United States Government, as it was anticipated that the question would be raised in Parliament in the following week. In reply to this, the Secretary of State telegraphed on 24th February that His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Washington was being instructed to make a communication on the lines arranged with the Canadian Government to the Government of the United States of America.In accordance with this assurance, a telegram [No. 208] was despatched from the Foreign Office to Mr. Lindsay at Washington on. 26th February, requesting him to make the following communication to the United States Government: In view of the importance of the relations between Canada and the United States, His Majesty&apos;s Government have for some time been in communication with the Canadian Government, with the object of providing for more complete representation of Canadian interests at Washington than has hitherto existed. Such a development seems clearly desirable in view of the constant increase, which, will no doubt be maintained in future, in commercial and social inter-course between Canada and the United States. To meet this situation, a representative, selected by the Canadian Government with the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary, is about to be appointed to deal with Canadian affairs ; he will be a member of the Embassy staff. His Majesty&apos;s Government have no doubt that the introduction of this system, designed as it is to facilitate the transaction of business between the United States and Canada, will be acceptable to the United States Government. It is proposed to announce the introduction of the new system, both here and in Ottawa, at an early date.By a telegram [No. 209] despatched at the same time, Mr. Lindsay was authorized, in explanation of the above, to add verbally, that the introduction of the new system will not denote any departure, either on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government or of 13-1 B
the Canadian Government, from the principle, of the diplomatic unity of the, British Empire, The new Minister wili rank in the Embassy immediately after the Ambassador, and will, take charge in the latter&apos;s absence. He will, However; at all times be the ordinary channel of communication in matters of purely Canadian interest. He will receive credentials direct from the King, as in the case of His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Paris,As a matter of courtesy to the United States Government, their concurrence as soon as possible was requested..League of Nations. The Governor-General telegraphed on 13th February to the Secretary of State, on the subject of British votes in. the League of Nations, to the following effect With reference to previous telegrams, my Ministers have been informed confidentially from an United States source, that a modification of the Lenroot reservation is likely to be agreed upon in the following terms&quot;Until Part I., being the covenant of the League of Nations, shall be so amended as to provide that the United States shall be entitled to cast a number . of votes equal to that which any member of the League and its self-governing Dominions, Colonies, or part of Empire, in the aggregate, shall be entitled tb cast, the United States assumes no obligation to be bound by any election,, decision, finding or report of an Assembly or Council, in which any member of the.League and its self-governing Dominions, Colonies or parts of Empire, in the aggregate, have cast more than vote. The United States assumes no obligation tb be bound by any decision, finding or report of an Assembly or Council, arising out of any dispute between the United States and any member of the League, if such member; or any self-governing Dominion, Colony, Empire or part of Empire united with it politically, has voted.&quot;The Canadian people would look upon the final adoption of such, a reservation by the United States Government as a direct challenge of their position. Such action would be deeply resented here, and the Canadian Government cannot possibly accede to it. My Ministers feel that it should be made perfectly clear to the United States Government that no such reservation, either in its original or modified form, as is contained in the first portion of the Lenroot reservation, coidd be acceded to by the British Empire. My Ministers feel it necessary clearly to advise you of the situation before any further action is taken.&apos; Treaty with Bulgaria.- On 19th February the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies the following enquiry as to the ratification of the Bulgarian Treaty : In view of the policy adopted last session by my Ministers, with reference to the submission to Parliament for approval of the Treaty of Peace with enemy countries, they think it is desirable to submit the Bulgarian Treaty to Parliament. Parliament meets again on 28th February, and they enquire whether ratification could be delayed for this purpose without serious prejudice to important interests.   They think the action of Parliament can be completed at an early date.Reciprocity with British Honduras. On 25th February the Secretary of State for the Colonies transmitted to the Governor-General of Canada the request &quot;bf the Governor of British Honduras that the following resolution of the Select Committee of the Legislative Council might be communicated to the Governor-GeneraLs Ministers :  &quot;That reciprocity arrangements would be favourably entertained by this Colony, on the lines of the agreement between Canada and certain West Indian Colonies, dated 9th April 1912, provided that the Government of Canada can secure for the Colony regular steamship communications, and that the Govern-merit of Canada be requested to inform this Government at the earliest possible date whether it is prepared to include the Colony in the said agreement.&quot;. Imports from the United Kingdom. Information received by the High Commissioner on 25th February gives the total value of imports from the, United Kingdom during January as $16,400,000, the largest figure attained in. any month since the outbreak of war. Textiles showed the largest increase. Imports from the United States amounted to $74,000,000.   . \ r ;r jCanadian-Australian Service. The High Commissioner has been informed that the regular Canadian-Australian service of the Canadian Government.; Merchant Marine was inaugurated on. 23rd February. ;;; ;7        -&quot;&apos;
Immigration [B.E.R., xi., p. 9]. It has been reported to the High Commissioner; -that a big immigration movement into Canada from the&apos; United States is already in progress. &apos;-.-AUSTRALIA.League of Nations. On 21st February the Governor-General of Australia, telegraphing to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, transmitted the following message from his Prime Minister :  I quite agree that.it is most desirable, that on questions of great moment all parts of the Empire should, present a united front. Also I think that the-suggestion that these should be discussed previously is good in itself, but the appointment for the purpose of discussion of a representative in London raises a most important question. Whether:the machinery is compatible with those rights of self-government which the Dominions possess and that status under the League of Nations which is -accorded to them by the Treaty seems doubtful. Without prejudice to any such proposal I think, however, that it is very desirable that the various parts of the Empire should:keep in intimate touch with one another and that each part should be informed of what the others are doing or intend to do, and I think that pro tern, a branch of the British Cabinet Secretariat would be the mest convenient means of ensuring that each part of the Empire may, before its own views are communicated finally to the Secretariat-General, be informed of the policy of the other parts.Wool. Oil 24th February the Governor-General of Australia transmitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies the following telegram from his Prime Minister : On the 26th February Parliament opens, and it is imperative that the information and assurances for which I have asked should be available. It is. clear that the position is impossible and Cannot continue in view of the magnitude of the sums involved and the fact that since the armistice, at least, the British Treasury has received its half share of the profits upon the sale of our wool, while neither the Commonwealth Government nor the growers have even been informed of the amount of their half share.In reply to this the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Governor-General on .25th February as follows: With reference to your telegrams of 6th [B.E.R., xi., p. 10] and 24th February with regard to wool, His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that the Commonwealth Government should have been caused any embarrass-ment by Press reports following upon the proceedings of the Board of Trade Profiteering Committee. The report of that, Committee, which is being sent by mail, makes no estimate of profits on Australian wool sold in Great Britain. Fanciful estimates of these profits have, however, been published, and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have been attacked for not issuing Australian wool at contract price to British consumers, having in mind that since 1916, Australian manufacturers have received their supplies at the basis price of.the Imperial purchase contract. On this point His Majesty&apos;s Government fully accept the desire of the Commonwealth Government, as stated in your telegram of 16th December, that all sales henceforward shall be made by open auction, or alternatively that the Commonwealth Government, shall be consulted as to the issue price. Every effort has been made to obtain the fullest possible information in reply to your Prime MinisteFs questions, but until the accounts have been fully audited the immense volume and complexity of these wool transactions make it impossible to ascertain results with reasonable accuracy at the end of each financial year. The following replies supplied by the Ministry of Munitions are based on very carefully framed estimates, but the greatest possible caution should be used in making them public, for His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be responsible for errors and omissions which may considerably alter the final result. Wrong inferences as to the future may be easily drawn from these figures, for there is considerable accumula-tion of wool of slow sale which will lie ultimately sold with little- or no margin of profit. &apos;   i:1. Up to date the sales total approximately 1,100,000 bales of military wool and 2,100,000 bales for civilian purposes.2. The average price, cannot be yet ascertained.3. Since 1st April 825,000 bales haye -been sold at auction, and 50,000 bales move at the equivalent - of auction prices. The average- auction price is estimated at od^d. per lb.   Wool sales at issue prices in the United Kingdom 336,000 bales, and to the
sAllies 190,000 bales, the average price working out at approximately 29-f2. per lb-All these figures include a proportion of scoured wool. As the quantities given in my telegram of 30th December included New Zealand and South African wool, they were-considerably larger than those now given.4. It is impossible to answer this question in detail, as the prices of wool and tops varied daily between April and November, and in view of the great variety of&quot; grades and qualities. Taking, however, 64&apos;s as typical of fine wools, which have gone up heavily in price throughout the auctions, and 46&apos;s as typical of coarser wools, which, have varied very little in price, the following figures are supplied : 64&apos;s, issue price April to November, clean scoured, basis 63d. ; London auction sales, April average 733., May 842., July 792., October 1002. Resultant tops quoted April at 732., May 882., July .1062., October 1232.46&apos;s, issue price for wool April to October, clean scoured, basis 332.; average auction prices, April 362., May 382., July 352., October 382. Resultant tops quoted April 392., May 422., July 452., October 452.5. This is answered under 3.6. The closest approximation that can be made of moneys received by His Majesty&apos;s Government for Australian wool for army purposes 45,500,0001., and for civilian purposes .107,500,000. Of profits clue to growers, no estimate can be made except that up to 31st March 1918, including underwriting profits, the growers&apos; share according to provisional accounts was slightly over 1,900,0001.7. At the end of December last, the approximate number of bales of wool unsold was as follows :-United Kingdom     -     -   323,000      Afloat     - 244,000America  -     -     -     -    50,000     Australia appraised quan-Antwerp - 15,000        titles slightly under     - 1,400,0008. The current prices for tops at Bradford, 5th February 1920 were : 70&apos;s      - - - - - 15G 50&apos;s -     -     -     -     - 70&apos;64&apos;s warp - - - - 150 48&apos;s - 5164&apos;sordy. - - - - 147 46&apos;s ----- 42C0&apos;s sup. - - - - 141 44&apos;s -     -     - 3958&apos;s      - - - - - 112 40&apos;s -     -     -     -     - 3656&apos;s      - - - 96 36&apos;s -     -     -     -     - 349. Until the end of last year the Imperial wool trading account continually showed a large debit balance owing to moneys paid out for wool purchased being greatly in excess of moneys received for wool sold. The total debit balance in the Imperial wool trading account as a whole was in excess of 5,000,0002. on 31st December. It is estimated that payments in respect of Australian wool exceeded 153,000,0002. up to 31st December, receipts being somewhat less, but the exact figures are not yet ascertainable.His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite unable to assent to the proposal that the-Australian share of the wool profits ought to be paid forthwith, and that such profits should be hereafter paid as and when sales are made. Up to the present no surplus has accrued out of which any bonus could be paid. Clips were bought as a whole, and no clip has been as yet totally sold, because large quantities of almost unsaleable wool have accumulated out of each successive clip. The profits made up to 31st March 1919 were on a very small scale, and profits since made cannot possibly be accurately computed and audited until after the close of the financial year on 31st March 1920.. A time will arrive when the payment of an interim dividend will be both reasonable and advisable, but such a distribution could not possibly be justified for several months to come, and the amounts payable must be determined by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury in view of the available cash surplus in the trading account and other 3-s&apos;elevant factors. The Commonwealth Government may rest assured that full interest will be paid to Australia on the growers&apos; share of the cash surpluses.Butter [B.E.R., xi, p. 10]. On 26th February the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governor-General of Australia that the Food Controller was unable to consider any amendment of the purchase price of butter while the present contract was in operation, and that it was not possible at present to reply definitely regarding a further contract, as the question of a continuation of control had not been definitely settled. .
Meat. -On 18th February the following telegram, from the. Prime Minister of Australia was transmitted by.the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies :  . ,     l   ,      .-,    , rl      (,, i uI have not yet received a reply to my previous urgent telegram with regard to meat. Cable reports indicate that the British Government have purchased Pata-gonian meat, and Australian growers are most anxious to learn whether it is also proposed, that Empire grown meat should be purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government.In reply to this and a previous telegram on 23rcl February, the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of Aitstralia as follows: -(I) As indicated in my telegram of 1st November, the Board of Trade are advised that the date of the termination of the Australian contracts is governed by section 1. (I.) of the Termination of the Present War Definition Act, 1918. It is impossible, however, to state at present how soon the proclamation under this section is likely to be issued, in view of the.fact that treaties with all the enemy Powers are not completed.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government do not desire to enter into further contracts for the purchase of meat after the termination of those now existing.(3) As regards Patagonia, His Majesty&apos;s Government recently found it advisable to renew the contract in force during the war for the purchase of the exportable surplus of Patagonian mutton and lamb in respect of the present killing season; which ends in April 1920. The amount involved is about 25,000 tons. This purchase was made with the object of protecting as far as possible the supplies of Australian and New Zealand mutton and lamb under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government from the competition, of freshly killed mutton exported from foreign sources. The steamers employed in conveying this mutton are of limited capacity and are not suitable for diversion to the Australian or New Zealand trade. ,Telegraphing again on the same day to the Governor-General of Australia, the Secretary of State informed him that the Government of New Zealand had urged a short extension of the contract for the purchase of New Zealand meat, which included at present only meat put into cold store by 30th June 1920, and added that it might be advisable, if the Australian contracts should not have been terminated by that date owing to the non-issue of the proclamation, to extend the New Zealand contract so as to make it terminate at the same time as the Australian contracts, and the matter was being considered.NEW ZEALAND.Meat. The following telegram was sent on 23rd February by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General of New Zealand in reply to the latteFs telegrams of 9th, 12th and 17th February :  As regards continuation of purchases of New Zealand meat after 30th June 1920, the matter is under consideration and I will reply as soon as possible.As regards other points the position is as follows : Since November 1919 there has been increasing congestion in the ports and cold stores of the United Kingdom with a resultant delay in the discharge of ships recently arrived. This state of affairs was caused by unavoidable delays in the return of requisitioned ships to their owners in the early months of 19.19, delays in outward sailings from London about the same period on account of labour troubles, subsequent delays owing to coaling and labour difficulties at intermediate ports and unusual delays in the ports, of Australia and New Zealand. The general effect has been a disarrangement of the shipping programme, so that the arrival of a large number of vessels in the United Kingdom coincided with the period when home grown meat is usually available for sale in abundance. Further, beef is commonly eaten in greater quantity than mutton and lamb in the United Kingdom in winter.From now until the summer the supplies of home grown meat in the United Kingdom will be much less important and the consumption of mutton and lamb normally increases. Arrangements have been made for larger quantities of Australian and New Zealand mutton and lamb to be placed on the market. Large sales of New Zealand lamb have been made to the United States and endeavours are being made to develop this market;&apos; The possibility of making sales on the Continent, has not been overlooked, but Continental nations prefer beef to mutton or lamb.&apos; Further, the French Government control importation of meat into France, and import, licences on private account are not at present obtainable. The matter is being taken Ht, with the Uovernment of France.
I hope that your Ministers will issue a categorical denial of the statement that preference has. been shown to the shipment of supplies from South America during the past year. As your Ministers are aware, the diversion of steamers from Australia and New Zealand to South America was a war measure imposed on His Majesty&apos;s Government by dire necessity. With the cessation of the need, the diversion terminated and steamers were returned to Australian and New Zealand trade as fast as they were released by the Shipping Controller. Every such vessel, has now returned to the Australian and New Zealand trade. Moreover, every opportunity which offered itself for diverting Plate steamers to Australia and New Zealand has been taken. Two such steamers, capable of carrying 8,000 tons of meat, are now on the outward voyage, and New Zealand will ultimately benefit bom these steamers. Endeavours have been made to charier American and Italian insulated steamers for New Zealand trade, but unfortunately the negotiations were unsuccessful.Your Ministers should know that His Majesty&apos;s Government recently found it advisable to renew the contract in force during the war for the purchase of the exportable surplus of Patagonian mutton and lamb in respect of the present killing-season, which ends April .1920. The amount involved is about 25,000 tons. This purchase was made with the object of protecting as far as possible the supplies of Australian and New Zealand mutton under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government from the competition of freshly killed meat exported from foreign sources. The steamers employed in conveying this meat are of limited capacity and not suitable for diversion to the Australian or New Zealand trade.In conclusion, quite apart from reasons of an Imperial character, His Majesty&apos;s Government are most anxious to avoid expenditure for storage in New Zealand and for demurrage on steamers. Consequently, it is to their interest as much as to that of the New Zealand Government to put an end to the present congestion and to ship the New Zealand output of the current season at the earliest possible date.SOUTH AFRICA.WdoL-Oa. 26th February the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General of South Africa : The Minister of Munitions&apos;regrets that no estimate of profits due to South African growers can be yet made as no trading accounts have been completed beyond 31st March 1918, up to which date no South African wool had been sold, it is hoped that the profits made up to 31st March 1919 will be ascertained in the course of the next few months. Until the accounts have been completed and audited it is impossible to estimate them with reasonable accuracy.The total number of South African bales landed was 111,373. Of these approxi-mately 41,000 were sold before 1st April 1919, and 1,300 between 1st April and 31st December 1919, for military purposes. Approximately 30,000 were sold prior to 1st April .1919, and 37,600 between 1st April and 31st December 1919, for civil purposes. Approximately 13,400 bales of the above have been sold at auction since 1st April 1919, The remainder at issue prices. It is anticipated that the small number of bales remaining will be disposed of shortly. The gross amount received from sales up to 31st December 1919 is approximately 2,8O0,0OOZ. for civil and 1,700,0001. for military. Payments have still to be made from the total of these amounts on account of rebates to the Army vote and to the Allies, for carriage on British railways, for interest on capital, for services rendered by other Government. departments, and for sundry other charges.South African growers will not be prejudiced by the unavoidable delay in settlement. While the wool trading account was in debt to the British Treasury it was debited with interest, and it will Lie credited with interest by the Treasury, during the whole period, on amounts by which it has been in credit. Full interest will lie therefore paid to South Africa on the growers&apos; share of cash surpluses.Transvaal Nationalists&apos; Election Manifesto. The Transvaal Nationalist Party has issued its election manifesto. It demands a number of social and economic reforms, including, for instance, industrial development by the extension of railways and the amendment of the Customs tariffs,&apos;the limitation of working hours, the restriction of immigration until the industrial population of South Africa has assured its position, the recognition of Trade Unions, the repatriation of Asiatics, the segrega-tion of natives and the establishment of old age and invalid pensions. (Renter, Pretoria, 17th February.)
The Electioneering Campaign. In the course of an electioneering speech at Pretoria on 19th February, General Smuts, dealing with Sir Thomas Smartfs. criticism of the Government for &quot;its failure to prevent speculation in foodstuffs,,to purchase the Union&apos;s wheat crop, at a fair price, and to control&apos;millers&apos; and bakers&apos; prices,&quot; said that the present high prices were being caused by world conditions aggravated by one of the heaviest droughts recorded in the history of South Africa. Moreover, he declared, the plentiftduess of money in South Africa:had encouraged waste, extravagance and gambling. It would be the first business of Parliament to-take drastic steps against the. profiteer on the people&apos;s food, by passing an Act as severe as the English law on the subject. Local committees should also be given drastic powers to check rack-renting, and the Government should be prepared to advance money to, local authorities for the purpose of assisting their housing schemes. Referring to the suspension of the import duties on wheat, flour and maize, General Smuts said that this step had been taken on account of profiteering in which millers were involved. He would license dealers and brokers in foodstuffs who, if they went in for speculation, would be cleared out of business by the cancelling of their licences.-(Renter. Pretoria, 19th February.)In a speech at Johannesburg on 19th February, referring, to Sir Thomas Smartfs speech at, Pretoria on the 15th instant in which the Unionist Leader maintained that his party was guiltless as regards existing economic conditions and that the Unionists had: done their utmost to impress upon the Government the necessity of improving the condition of the workers, Colonel Greswell, the Labour Leader, declared, in a , speech, that before the Unionists would move in Parliament to relieve the high costs . of living and oppose profiteering they had to be &quot; kicked by some labour resolution.&quot; The Labour Party would fight for the fixing of,prices whenever possible and also for public control of the country&apos;s credit through the establishment of a State Bank. He affirmed that the Unionists&apos; main stock-in-trade was their appeal to racial passion.Colonel Creswell added that he was as determined as any man to maintain the Union&apos;s status as a great self-governing Dominion of the Empire. (Reuteiy Johannes-burg, 19th February.)The Elections.--A feature worthy of notice in the nominations received for the elections to the House of Assembly is the fact that apart from Sir Thomas Smartt, the Unionist Leader, who has been returned unopposed for Fort Beaufort, only two other Unionists are unopposed,&apos; Mr. R. Feetham (Parktown) and Mr. Van der Riet (Albany). Another striking feature is the number of urban constituencies in the Transvaal in which three or four candidates are seeking election. In four Witwatersrand seats, for example: Internationalist Socialists are opposing Labour candidates. General, Stunts lias three opponents at Pretoria West, a Unionist, a Nationalist and a Labour candi-date, but only in a comparatively few cases are Unionists and members of the South African (?) contesting the same seat.   (Renter, Capetown, 18th February).South African Politics. Speaking at a Unionist election rally in Pretoria, Sir Thomas Smartt, Leader of the Opposition, paid a tribute to General Botha&apos;s and General Smuts&apos;, attitude during the war, and said that had this been otherwise, South Africans fate would have been terrible to contemplate. He would have liked to see a United Party going, forward to fight the, great, issue raised- by the Nationalists, which the Labour Leader, Colonel Creswell, had treated so lightly. The Nationalist movement aimed not at substituting, a republican for a monarchical form of govern-ment, but was solely and entirely anti-British.Dealing with economic questions, Sir Thomas claimed that the Unionists were guiltless as far as existing conditions were concerned. One of their foremost planks was the prevention of a monopolization of the necessaries of life. They had impressed upon the Government that it was essential that the conditions of the workers should be improved. The Unionists were the only democratic party ; they welcomed the real representatives of the labouring people, but they were opposed to class hostility and direct action.Sir Thomas Smartt criticized the Governments failure to prevent speculation in foodstuffs, and to purchase the Union&apos;s wheat crop at a fair price, and to control millers&apos; aiid bakers&apos; prices.   (Renter, Pretoria, 15th February.)General Smuts and the League of Nations. The Prime Minister, General Smuts, speaking at an agricultural show luncheon in Ma-lmsbury, expressed the hope that the League of Nations would teach all peoples that they are brothers. This, he said, could be taken as an. example for South Africa.
&apos; General Smuts welcomed the presence of four German &quot;friends&quot; from ex-German South-West Africa who had been attending the conference of the Farmers&apos; Associations at Pretoria. The Prime Minister also extended a welcome to the new South-West Protectorate, and hoped that the people of the Union would -live-together in prosperity with the permanent population of that country.&apos; (Renter, Mahnsbury, 12th February.)Native Troubles.-General Smuts in a speech here to-day, referring to the native-trouble, said that that day he had been busy with something serious and dangerous that was moving on the AVitwatersrand. He stated that between 30,000 and 40,000 blacks were on strike, and by means of well-organized picketting, were doing things they would have considered the natives incapable of. He had seen, he said, portents and signs that a tremendous change was coming over South Africa. The nonsense they had been talking of republics, and of blood and tears, the native would put into practice, and too late they would find that their idle talk had put these mischievous ideas into the heads of the natives. (Renter, Pretoria, 19th February.)High Prices. The report of the &quot; Cost of Living Commission &quot; contains the following recommendations to the Government: Extended power for the Commission and for Local Committees on the lines of the English Profiteering Act; the establish-ment of market bureaux; the dissemination of information relating to prices; Government encouragement for the establishment of consumers&apos; co-operative stores ; the formation of Rent Appeal Boards; Government importation of wheat or flour; the fixing of the price of butter and fat at 2s. per pound ; legislation for preventing speculation; the establishment of a board to regulate prices on lines similar to those in use in the system in connexion with ithe Natal sugar industry, .which applies to planters, millers, refiners, and wholesale and retail, dealers, with periodical modifications. ]The Commission then makes the following comment : -&quot; A wave of extravagance in. permeating every class with the exception of that part of the population whose incomes are barely sufficient to meet necessitous demands, though even there, there is an appalling amount of waste.&quot; The report recommends training in domestic science as a remedy for waste.In conclusion the report states that it is clearly proved that the present-wheat prices are largely clue to speculation, in which some large millers have participated.   (Renter, Pretoria, 19th February.)Cereal Shortage. In view of the shortage of supplies of cereals, the Union. Government has decided to suspend the import duties on wheat, flour and maize. (Renter, Pretoria, 17th February.)Indians in Africa. At a meeting of the Council held to-day, another discussion took place with regard to the position of the Indians in Africa, Sir George Barnes, Commerce Member, said that Sir Benjamin Robertson had proceeded to make full enquiries in South Africa, British East Africa and Uganda, and to confer with the local officials, while Lord Milner, Mr. Montagu and. General Sir Edward Northey could confer in London. A resolution was finally adopted that Sir Benjamin. Robertson would make enquiries and submit suggestions to the Government of India.. Mr. G. S. Khaparcls complained of the personnel of the South African Commission [B.E.R., xi., p. 12], regretting that no Indian representative had accompanied Sir Benjamin Robertson.
