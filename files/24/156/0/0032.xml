GREAT BRITAIN.Unemployment. The following paragraph is taken from the Special Weekly Report on Unemployment of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 26th November : Unemployment appears to be still on the increase in nearly all parts of the country. Trade depression continues. No improvement is anticipated before next year either in cotton or woollen industries. Large stocks of manufactured goods remain unsold owing to high prices and difficulties of continental trade. Several divisions report that serious loss is being experienced in the ship-repairing industry owing to the diversion of repair work to Antwerp and other continental ports. It is stated that continental firms are able to quote lower prices and to give definite dates for completion of contracts. The jute and linen industries in Scotland are very slack, and the position is unchanged in. the leather, boot and shoe, and clothing industries generally.The General Labour Situation.-The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 4th December: The industrial situation at the close of the week under review, in so far as disputes actually in progress are concerned, is almost as quiet as last week. Two factors, however, taken together, make the outlook for the immediate future uncertain. Firstly, the sharp increase during October in the cost of living, clue mainly to the increase in the price of bread and flour on the 17th October, which has now been reflected in the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number, may lead to a series of demands over the whole country for some compensating increase in wages. Secondly, the general state of trade is such that employers are likely to resist to the uttermost any further wages concessions. It is not so much, perhaps, that marked depression is already a feature of the situation in many industries, but rather that pessimism is generally prevalent with regard to&apos; the prospect of an early removal of the causes to which the general commercial stagnation is attributed.There is already evidence that these factors may result in immediate trouble in two broad groups of cases. Firstly, in certain industries which have adopted a sliding scale, by which wages vary according to the cost of living, the question of suspending the sliding scale agreement is already being raised. &apos; Secondly, the prospect of a peaceful solution to wages negotiations which have been proceeding amicably, in some cases, for months is made more doubtful. Particular reference may be made to the engineering and shipbuilding industries and the tramway industry.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;C.EGYPT.The Agrarian Situation. On 1st December Lord Allenby reported [No. 140] that after consultation with the Sultan, and the Ministers, the following measure had been taken to deal with the present agrarian situation : A Government communique has been published in the press dealing with the fluctuations of the cotton market since the armistice, and with the present reaction in prices. It dwells on the world-wide fall in the prices of all commodities, which has been brought about by the decrease in public and private expenditure, by the check on speculation, and by the universal anti-profiteering agitation. Its general tone . emphasizes the fact that the crisis of the fall in the price of cotton from which Egypt is now suffering, after benefiting from an abnormal inflation of price following on the armistice, is of an economic and world-wide character, and is as such outside the sphere of influence of the producing country. The Government urges landowners to forbear, in the interest of the community at large, as well as in their own interests, from exacting payment of rent in excess of that which the tenant is reasonably able to bear in view of the present low.price of cotton.
&quot;The communique announces the institution of. a Government commission under ^the presidency of Ahmed Pasha Ali, Minister of the Interior, and composed of the following:-Mohammed Zaghonl Pasha, Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Wakfs and late Inspector of Irrigation, the mudir of the province of (group unde-cypherable), Mr. Ross Taylor, Sultanic Counsellor, Mr. A. T. McKillop, Inspector-General of Agriculture, Mr. R. V, Wild, Director-General of direct taxes.The commission is appointed to study the economic effect upon the country of the world-wide fall in the price of cotton, and to consider what measures of assistance can be rendered to small cultivators and tenants who are placed in. difficulties thereby.The Cotton Control Scheme [B.E.R., xi, p. 2], On 1st December the following telegram [No. 997] was sent to Lord Allenby in regard to the disposal of the cotton - control scheme profits :-(I) The matter was again considered by the Cabinet on 11th June, when, on the recommendation of Lord Milner, a decision was postponed pending the final settlement -of the Egyptian question.(2) However, an immediate decision based on a reasonable compromise is required, and a suggestion is now being put forward to the Cabinet that His Majesty&apos;s Government should surrender to the Egyptian Government one-half of their share of the profits on the understanding that it will be devoted to the payment of indemnities and pensions to the disabled and to relatives of the deceased members of the Egyptian Labour Corps, as in present circumstances it is impossible to accept this charge on British funds.(3) If the Treasury and the Board of Trade can be induced to accept this compromise we shall be able to authorize the release of one-half of the profits to the Egyptian Government for budgetary purposes and a further quarter for the purpose indicated in your despatch No. 836, whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government will retain for themselves the remaining quarter.PALESTINE.; Recruiting for the Hejas Army. On 30th November Sir Herbert Samuel reported [No. 401] that letters had been sent on behalf of Emir Abdulla to the&apos; Hauran to rouse the people against the French. Also that Sheriffan officers were trying to find recruits in Salt for the Hejaz army : they emphatically declared that they had no hostile intentions against the British, but intended, to fight the French. As he had no troops in the district, Sir Herbert Samuel said that nothing effective &apos;Could be clone, but he had instructed his officers to dissuade the population of Trans-Jordania from taking part in any such movement.Telegraphing again on 3rd December [No. 406] Sir Herbert -Samuel said that he proposed to issue a notice to the inhabitants of Trans-Jordania informing them that there was no truth in the rumour that the British Government approved the movement which, it was reported, was being made against the French. On the -contrary, such a movement would be condemned by His Majesty&apos;s Government.On 7th December [No. 285] Lord Curzon notified Ins approval of the proposal on these lines.MESOPOTAMIA.The Question of Turkish Government Buildings. The High Commissioner telegraphed from Baghdad, as follows on 22nd November [No. 14107] :-In connexion with the ; establishment of a National Government, it is most essential, if we are to convince the public of the bona fides of our policy, that the former Turkish Government buildings in the Serai, which have been under military occupation since the fall of Baghdad, should be restored to them. I have explained the position to the General Officer Commanding, and have made.specific proposals for (? the handing over) to him of certain buildings at present occupied by the. civil office together with certain other (? buildings) sufficient to provide (? accommodation). equivalent to that vacated in the Serai. The commander-in-Chief agrees in principle that the transfer must lie made, but, in view of the fact that the War Office has hitherto paid no rent for the Serai, even since the armistice, and as it will be necessary to pay rent for the accommodation now offered, he considered, it necessary
-to refer the financial aspect of the question to the War Office by telegraph (? 5th November) and feels unable to proceed with the evacuation pending instructions from them.   Similarly, until the evacuation is definitely agreed to, I hesitate to incur-the expense of certain petty alterations which are necessary in order to adapt the new accommodation for military use.We are thus at an impasse and progress with the policy of His Majesty&quot;s Government is delayed.I submit that the question of adjustment of cost between the military and this administration is one which must be finally settled by correspondence, which may take weeks or even months, and that there is no necessity to delay transfer pending-its settlement.I request that His Majesty&apos;s Government will accept this view and that the-Commander-in-Chief and I may be authorized to proceed to the transfer at once. We can then report the final aspect of the case separately Avith our views in order that the question of cost may be discussed and settled at convenience between the depart-ments of State interested, in case the Oommander-m-Chief cannot be authorized to-settle the rent direct with me here.The General Officer Commanding has seen the above and concurs.TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.Dale of the Belgian Evacuation. -Sir George Grahame telegraphed from Brussels-[No. 161] oil 6th December reporting that he had spoken to the Minister for Foreign! Affairs and the Minister of the Colonies about the transfer of the former German East Africa. The Minister of the Colonies in particular was very accommodating as regards agreeing to evacuation on 1st January even though the Traffic Convention was not yet ready for signature. Sir George added that he expected to receive an official note agreeing to this date within the next clay or two.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xxxi, p. 3], Reporting on the Waziristan operations, the Viceroy telegraphed [836 F.R.] on 22nd November that all sections of the Wana Waziris had accepted the terms at a representative jirga held at Sarwakai on 20th November.   They asked for 20 days&apos; grace to bring in 300 Government rifles, 250 tribes&apos; rifles and 40,000 in cash or kind.On 2nd December the Viceroy telegraphed [No. 222] that in consequence of the arrival of a convoy with money and ammunition for Haji Abdur Razak, the leaders of&quot; the Wana Waziris were, according to report, continuing their hostility, by refusing to act in consort with the friendly sections who-were complying with the terms. The&apos; situation of the Wana column at Sarwakai was reported to be normal.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xxx, p. 2]. On 24th November the Viceroy reported [1349 S.] that a reply, dated 16th November, had. been received from the Amir to-the telegram [1266 S.] sent by the Indian Government, 1st November.   Briefly summarized, the amir&apos;s reply expressed his pleasure in agreeing to the despatch of&quot; an envoy to Kabul with the object of concluding a treaty, and his desire for friendly terms with neighbouring Governments.   As an independent country Afghanistan was entitled to enter.into relations with her neighbours, and was desirous of doing so with the Russian Government, which had already entered on relations and discussions with the British Government both of a commercial and a political character.   Any agree-ments which might be entered into with the Russian Government would not affect the-lawful rights of the British Government.   The result of the discussions which had taken, place was that a Russian Ambassador was now at Kabul, and representatives of Afghanistan were located at different places in Russia as consuls and envoys.   The location of  any foreign  consulate in  Afghanistan necessitated conformity with international usage, which restricted its scope to matters concerning trade and precluded interference in political matters.   The establishment of Russian consulates in Afghanistan with the object of creating mischief in British dominions would never be permitted.   On this account the Amir expressed the belief that the despatch
of the envoy would be expedited, and was confident that the discussions at Kabul would furnish even greater proof of real amity than those which had. taken place at Mussoorie. The-reply then referred to Waziristan-and expressed the. hope that a speedy completion of peace would remove a question which had long been a cause of misunderstanding.On the same date as the above, Tarsi addressed a letter to the Foreign Secretary, in which lie urged the reasonableness of the Amir&apos;s reply and the absence of any difficulty in the despatch of an envoy. Especially he deprecated the idea of Afghanistan becoming the means of harm of Russian origin reaching our borders, as this would be injurious to her own interests.The Viceroys Weekly Reports.-The following reports dated 23rd ancl 27th November have been received : I. (23rd. November).--Last week we gave press criticisms on the resolution on non-co-operation. We now&apos; give a summary of the impressions formed by the /correspondents regarding its reception. In many quarters educated Indians recognize that the resolution should be welcomed as an attempt to rally sober, intelligent, Indian opinion against non-co-operation, and approve the decision of the Government not to adopt repressive measures, as arrests would embarrass moderate Indians. At the same time, in some quarters it is felt that great harm is done to the prestige -and authority of the Government, that the mischief makers should be suppressed, -and that the present policy of non-intervention is likely to endanger the safety of the Government if carried on indefinitely. Race hatred is increasing, which is calculated to lead to an explosion. Other Indians adopt a via media. They think that the policy of conciliation has not yet had a full trial and should be continued. At the same time they recognize that seditious activities are most harmful hut are not peculiar to India and can be handled better by patience than by repression. High prices have given the agitator a weapon he has been quick to use. The extremists thrive on anti-Government agitation ancl would welcome repression. They do not fear it as it will mean a further agitation for their release. Gandhi ancl Shaukat Ali have been touring Southern India exhorting Brahmins and non-Brahmins to forgo their differences while the task of attaining svvaraj is before them. Gandhi has -opened, the new National. University and 70 students are enrolled at Ahmedabad with himself as Chancellor. The two lakhs collected for the purpose were mainly subscribed by the cloth merchants. Mohamed Ali has visited Benares ancl Allahabad -during the week with a view to push the non-co-operation movement amongst the students, but it is reported that little effect was produced in either place. The students are awaiting the arrival of Gandhi at Benares before finally deciding their action. Opinion among them is sharply divided. Malaviya is exerting all his influence to keep the -situation in hand. At Aligarh, correspondence has been published demanding from the Ali brothers accounts of the collections made by them -during the last 12 years. The trustees, fortified by their success in the first round and determined to pursue the struggle, have decided to embark on propaganda agaihit non-co-operation.As to the withdrawal of boys from schools and colleges, non-co-operation work is receding somewhat into the background, and non-co-operators are finding their work difficult and calculated to elicit opposition. Shah writes from Bombay that the non-co-operation movement is having practically no effect in Bombay except in Ahmedabad, and one place in Gujerat. Even in these two places only a small section -of the student population is affected. On the other hand, the students&apos; convention of the United Provinces, held, at Agra, adopted the non-co-operation resolution, after prolonged discussion, by a large majority, and expressed sympathy with the students .of Aligarh and other colleges. The students in Islamia College, Lahore, have struck, ancl the building is now under police protection, On the whole, however, the sober opinion of the trustees of educational institutions and of parents generally is strongly opposed to the movement as directed against the education of school children and students.As to the elections, it; is reported from Bombay that some 80 per cent, of the voters abstained from polling on one clay, but there was no absence of candidates-in -any province, and in some parts-the elections were keenly contested. In very few places have the extremists been able to carry out their threat of putting up men of straw to oppose bond, fide candidates.In public, however, non-co-operators, owing to superior organization ancl careful propaganda, have the advantage. There is always a difficulty in carrying resolutions 23-2 B
0against non-co-operation; for example, a meeting held at Broach for this purpose was-captured by non-co-operators, due to careless organizers, and the actual resolution adopting non-co-operation was passed. Gandhi seems to desire to try conclusions openly with the Government, his latest effusion being an article entitled &quot;If I were arrested,&quot; stating what he would expect his followers to do in that eventuality. The Amrita Bazar Patrika has recanted on non-co-operation as preached and practised by Gandhi, aud JSIeu) India continues to combat the movement.Bombay. The elections passed off peaceably. Our posters regarding intimidation to voters probably induced Gandhi to issue his appeal to the effect that non-co-operation ists should cease from persuasion on the 15th and should confine their activities to the 16th instant to meeting away from the poll booths. He spent a fortnight touring in Gujerat aud in the Peccan, and on the eve of his departure from Ahmedabad announced that uuteachables [?] have a right to be admitted to the&quot; national schools. As a result, a local national school declined to act on this ruling, and orthodox circles have been offended ; and in addition, the announcement has failed to fulfil its main object, the capture of non-Brahmin adherence in the Deccan to his campaign. There are indications that the small results achieved to date are-making him despondent. The percentage of those who voted was very small. A central caliphate committee meeting at Aligarh has been fixed for the 21st instant to consider national education, aud it is asserted that the national Moslem university scheme will be launched, though there are practically no funds either for the university or for the non-co-operation movement as a whole.Bengal.-Calcutta and the whole of Bengal observed the second anniversary of the armistice day on 11th November, normal business work and locomotion being-suspended. The non-co-operation movement has not made much headway. In most districts the general public is unaffected, one pauchayat only having resigned in 24 parganas. Well-attended meetings have been held, but with no appreciable-result. The Bengal caliphate committee is more concerned at present with collecting-funds than pushing propaganda, 30 lakhs of rupees being recptired. The latest device is the issue of one-rupee receipts, resembling a one-rupee note in size and shape, but superscribed in Urdu with a cpiotation from the Koran. Though, purporting to be a receipt, some private people will be deceived. For example, a litigant offered his pleader fees in these receipts. They were, of course, promptly returned. Press reports indicate that these receipts have reached Rangoon, also Madras. Legal opinion is being taken as to the means of stopping them. National schools have been started in Calcutta, but are likely to collapse. There has been some trouble among the students in Cbittagong, but elsewhere they are waiting a lead from more important institutions. There is no indication that this feature of non-co-operation will gain much support in Bengal. The opinion is freely expressed by educated Mohamedans that the Hindus have engineered the movement against Government schools with a view to retarding Mohamedan development. The attempt to boycott the new Councils has not met with much success. There has been no instance of a seat for which no candidate is forthcoming. For five seats on the Council of State there were 11 cancli-dates, and for the Bengal Chamber of Commerce only one seat was uncontested. For-17 seats in the Legislative Assembly 38 candidates were nominated, and there, were contests everywhere except (?) in two constituencies. For the Provincial Council there were 327 candidates to 113 seats. There was no contest in 19 constituencies out of 94... The strike fever continues, but so far its manifestations have been confined mainly to Calcutta and it has no political significance.United Provinces. The first results of the Aligarh incident have been a set-back to the propaganda of non-co-operators, but anti-European feeling is very strong aud the students are thoroughly excited. The Independent continues to advertise non-co-operation and the Leader to denounce it. Vernacular papers have condemned interference with educational institutions, and whole-hearted supporters of this aspect, of the movement in the vernacular press appear to be few.Punjab. Conferences have been held during the week at Hoshiarpur and Rohtak, and the speeches were violently anti-Government. At Rohtak a speaker opposiug non-co-operation was howled down; a fracas ensued, and the meeting was broken up. There has been considerable excitement amongst the student class and demonstrations, and, in many cases, absence without leave; but the movement is regarded with disfavour by the people at large as the promised national schools do not seem likely to materialize.   At Amritsar Khalsa College and one or two other schools,.
however, are still temporarily closed. Pressure is being brought to bear on title holders to surrender their titles, and in the event of a refusal they are threatened with a social boycott. But nominations for elections to the new Councils are not appreciably affected. The adoption of non-co-operation by the Central Sikli League at Lahore has led to an increase in agitation in the Jullundur and Hoshiarpur districts, and the Lieutenant-Governor is anxious to apply the Seditious Meetings Act. In deference, however, to our wishes he has taken action under section 3 (C) of Defence of India Rules restricting a few of the more violent speakers from these places from attending or making speeches at public meetings for a year. This policy has been pursued with some success and without undue comment in (?) Bengal. At Amritsar the district magistrate issued an order prohibiting the holding of the caliphate conference on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, and the presenting of an address to Colonel Wedgwood in Jallianwala Bagh on the 19th. Gandhi sent a telegram to the reception committee to obey the magistrate^ order, and the conference was postponed under protest and the presentation of an address to Colonel Wedgwood cancelled. The Amritsar municipality, at a special meeting, resolved to ask for the cancellation of the indemnity levied on the city, and also to relieve the committee of collections on the motion of Satya Pal.Delhi. The expiry of the application of the Seditious Meetings Act was immediately taken advantage of by the extremists for holding frequent meetings at which seditious language was used, particularly in mosques by certain preachers. A. fatwa signed by Ahmed Said justifying not only non-co-operation but forcible resistance has been examined to see if a prosecution would lie, but legal opinion is against this as the document is interspersed with quotations from the Koran. Meetings -were suddenly discontinued as the promoters feared the introduction of the Seditious Meetings Act with a view to the stoppage of the conference of ulema on the 21st, but we have decided to allow the conference to take place. Gandhi arrives here to-day and will attend the provincial congress on the 23rd, over which Mohamed Ali will preside. In practice Gandhbs policy is not meeting with much success. The Anglo-Arabic school committee reopened its school after five days&apos; holiday. All the masters except one are at work and two-thirds of the boys are attending. The national school which Asif Ali started has no funds and no pro-visional staff, and fewer students than any recently started school in a similar stage of development. The national arbitration court is at a standstill. There were six candidates for the Delhi seat in the Legislative Assembly : four of good standing, and two men of straw, petty traders, put up by non-co-operators to throw ridicule on the elections.Bihar and Orissa. The non-co-operation movement has not made much progress,, but efforts will be made to stimulate it during Gandhi&apos;s visits towards the end of the month. The agitation is more vigorous in the Patna division than elsewhere, where Maghar-ul-Huq is taking the lead. The movement, however, is said to be killing itself, and consciousness of this fact partly accounts for violent speeches. For 68 constituencies in the Legislative Council, 184 candidates were nominated, and 17 candidates were returned unopposed ; no nominations were made for the two non-Mohamedan rural constituencies, Shahabad and Darbhanga. For 12 constituencies in the Legislative Council, 25 candidates were nominated ; there were no candidates for the Bhagalpnr Mohaiuedan constituencies. For the Council of State, there were three candidates for the uon-Mohamedan constituencies and two for the Mohamedan. The new Legislative Council of Bihar and Orissa will be entirely in the hands of the landlord party, pleaders experiencing the utmost difficulty in securing election to any constituency in Bihar unless representing landed interests and supported by landowners. &apos; Efforts are being made to stir up unrest among school teachers aud colliery employees on the ground of inadequacy of wages.Central Provinces. There has been somewhat of a lull in the non-co-operation propaganda. The prosecution of Tajuddin, editor of the take , under sections 153 (A.) and. 505, Indian Penal Code, is reported to have shown effect at Jubbulpore. Khaparde refuses to resign his candidature for the Council of State in spite of pressure and a social boycott. There is no sign of trouble among the college students at Nagpur. The volunteer organizations of Sewa Samaj and the caliphate volun-teers are showing increased activity in a few districts, but they are not of a nature to give any ground for alarm. The proposals in regard to the export of wheat continue to excite angry comment ; and the extremist press devotes considerable-space to the death of McSwiney.
North-West Frontier Province. The example of Aligarh has been followed to some extent at Islamia College, Peshawar, and certain students have announced their intention of joining the national university to be established by Mohamed Ali at Aligarh. This proposal, however, has not yet translated into practice. Zafar Ali&apos;s conviction was received without excitement. A partial hartal was started in Peshawar city, but the shops were opened by 10 o&apos;clock the same morning. The president of the Bannu caliphate committee has withdrawn and asked for reinstate-ment as honorary magistrate, which he had previously resigned in pursuance of the non-co-operation programme. Colonel WedgwoocVs visit to Peshawar has again aroused undesirable political excitement, particularly in the school and the college, which have been closed as a precautionary measure. There was complete hartal on the 18th, owing to &quot;the imprisonment of three leading agitators in default of furnishing security under section 40 of the Frontier Crimes Regulations.Assam. The Viceroy&apos;s visit was successful in spite of the attempts of the non-co-operation party, and when they had succeeded in preventing the presentation of an address to the Viceroy, he was welcomed by representative gatherings including most of the Hindu and Mohamedan leaders. Candidates, one or more for every seat, and nearly all prominent politicians except Chanda, are offering themselves for election. He too allows it to be understood that he will welcome a Government nomination if the provincial congress reverses the resolutions of the Calcutta special congress on non-co-operation. The students of the Sylhet maclrassa are somewhat affected by the non-co-operation movement.The net result is that non-co-operation, though it has not made much progress in regard to elections or in schools, &amp;c, has made the students restless; this anti-Government feeling promoted by speakers and the extremist press is spreading, and among Mohamedans in some quarters social boycott is being used to intimidate those who do not sympathize. Feeling is more acute and the situation more dis-turbiug in the Punjab and Bombay than elsewhere.- II. (27th November). There is little to report; the situation is quieter and there is an improvement as regards the schools; normal work is expected to commence shortly in Islamia College, I ahore, and Khalsa College, Amritsar, the Government decision to withdraw Government control from the latter having been well received. Malaviya has contradicted the statement published in tbe Independent (Allahabad) of the 21st,. that the Maharaja of Mysore, Chancellor of the Hindu University, had been invited to come to Benares to handle the situation arising out of non-co-operation, he being in favour of it himself. He states that he definitely wishes non-co-operation were at an end. C. R. Das, B. C. Pal, Lajpat Rai are conferring with Malaviya at Benares. Great efforts are made by the non-co-operators to win over the Benares students ; Mohamed Ali asks for the complete abandonment by them of studies in such institutions, and Moti. Lai Nehru, addressing the students, characterized the non-co-operation movement as spiritual war, in which cause able bodied soldiers and mentally equipped persons like students were required. National institutions have been established, meeting with little success. The National College at Aligarh consists (? of) two bungalows, for which the caliphate committee pays Rs. 600 a month. The admissions were 100, but there are only 50 students at present, and only one lecture has been given so far. The college at Ahmadabad is similarly without sinews, but the principles of its working were announced with a flourish of trumpets. Patel has performed the opening ceremony of the national college at Surat. It is reported that college students from all over India intend to meet at Nagpur just before the national congress to define their attitude towards questions of the clay.The course of non-co-operation continues on the same lines-meetings adopting it, but few instances giving practical effect. It was condemned by a public meeting of Hindus and Mohamedans at Ghazipur, in the United Provinces, especially as regards the students. The Moslem Club, Luclhiana, unanimously and strongly condemned the non-co-operation propaganda and resolved to issue a pamphlet on the snbject to counteract mischief.Sastri has been lecturing in Madras on the fallacies of non-co-operation, and his patient and steady work is calculated to diffuse common sense and a reasonable attitude. At Allahabad a deputation of non-co-operators pressed the chairman of the Municipal Board to withdraw from his candidature for the Legislative Council He stated he did not believe in the movement and declined to withdraw. Gandhi had a very poor reception at Jhansi, where he was only able to collect less than Rs. 300.
The All-India, ulema conference was held at Delhi on the 19th, 20th, and 21st. On the first two days the meeting was not open to the public, but 375 delegates were present on the third day and many visitors.&apos; Gandhi and the Ali brothers were present. Resolutions were adopted urging the revival of Moslem fashion ancl dress, approving non-co-operation, condemning the action of the trustees of Aligarh,and other institutions, thanking the students for embarking on non-co-operation, urging Bind u-Moslem unity, condemning the repressive measures taken by the authorities against the ulema and caliphate workers, and advocating the immediate establishment of a Moslem treasury. We have received reports that the; meetings were uot a success, and the intention to convert the conference into1 an All-India one failed. There was much acrimonious discussion as to co-operation with Hindus and as to the attitude of the Moslem element towards Gandhi. Resolutions were passed en bloc on the last day of the conference chiefly for press consumption. At Delhi, the Ajmere-Merwara provincial conference was held on the 24th, 25th, and 26th. Resolutions were passed adopting non-co-operation, the boycott of the municipal, commissioners of Delhi, who voted for the address to H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, ancl those seeking election to the Councils. Gandhi&apos;s reception was poor, and his efforts to influence the Delhi students was reported unsuccessful.The Punjab Government issued a communique that a few clerks ancl minor officials who resigned service to perform hijrat, would/as far as possible, be allowed to return to their old posts, as far as this could be done without interfering with those who had received permanent promotion in their places. Absence may be condoned provided they return within, six months ancl satisfy the head of the oflice-of their repentance.Bombay have sanctioned the prosecution of the printer and the publisher of the Al Wahid newspaper of Karachi under section 124a, Indian Penal Code, in respect of three articles, (1) the conditions of Moslems and their fate, (2) the protection of the caliphate (3) the question of councils and titles in the issues of 14th September, 18th September and 6th October last.Private information has been received that non-co-operation is making no head-way in Bengal. Generally speaking, it may be said that the situation is easier and the outlook improved, but much will depend on the decision reached at the Nagpur congress next month. :THE DOMINIONS.Dantzig. On 26th November the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, anci South Africa: It has been decided that, as the cession of territory was already provided for in the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the declaration signed by the members of the Ambassadors&apos; conference in Paris, as representatives of the principal allied Powers, and accepted by the representatives of Dantzig, would be sufficient, and that signature on behalf of the Dominions -would not be necessary. Tin; declaration&apos; is now signed, and took effect on 15th November.The League of Nations. Cn 3rd December the Secretary of State, for the Colonies informed the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa that the League of Nations had circulated to its members for consideration at the conference to be held next January, draft conventions prepared by the provisional committee on communications and transit. It had been suggested by the Board of Trade that questions of common interest to the Empire might with advantage be informally discussed in advance between&apos; representatives appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, India, and the Dominions to attend this conference. The telegram continued : Please telegraph whether your Ministers could arrange for their representative to be present at such a discussion in London, say ten days before the elate fixed for the conference.International Ilydrograpliic Bureau.  On 1st December the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New-Zealand, and South Africa ancl the Governor of Newfoundland as follows : The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are anxious to know as soon as-possible whether the Dominion Governments desire to be associated with the work of 23-2 C
the International Hydrographie Bureau&apos;. It will be seen that the draft constitution of the bureau does not provide for the separate representation of the Dominions at hydro-graphic conferences, and should it be wished to amend the draft in order to include the necessary provisions it is feared that considerable delay would result, as protracted correspondence would be necessary with the other Governments concerned in order to ascertain whether this could be arranged. On the other hand, there seems no reason why the voting power for the appointment of the directors and the secretary under section 48 should not be shared between His Majesty&apos;s Government and any Dominion Government so desiring, provided that the latter were willing to contribute to the expenditure of the bureau in proportion to their shipping tonnage. If no Dominion Government desires to be associated with the bureau at this stage, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty propose to contribute under section 35 in proportion to the United Kingdom tonnage only.Clasps for Medals [B.E.R., xxxi, p. 7].- On 26th November the Governor-General of Canada reported that the proposals regarding the cpiestiou of clasps for the Mercantile Marine medals were acceptable to the Minister of Marine.CANADA.Miscellaneous.--The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs : (1) The Canadian trade returns for October record imports valued at $105,770,000, and exports amounting to $131,100,000, these being 135,000,000 in excess of the exports for September and 118,000,000 more than in October 1919.
