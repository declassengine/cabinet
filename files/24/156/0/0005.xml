MALTA.German Prisoners of War. On 23rd November Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 710] that the Secretary of the Swiss Legation, which was in charge of German interests, had called to see him in regard to the German prisoners of war and interned civilians (about 600 of each class). The Secretary had told him that these Germans had been riotous of late; that the local authorities were very anxious to be rid of them ; and that the Repatriation Committee in Malta had urged their immediate repat-riation, adding that be understood that the Italian Government would provide tonnage to convey them to Venice or Trieste.EGYPT.The Policy of Ris Majesty&apos;8 Government. On 14th November Lord. Allenby reported [No. 1582] that he had announced, the policy of His&apos; Mrijes&apos;ty&apos;s Government to the Prime Minister in the following terms which he was also making public : The policy of Great Britain in Egypt is to preserve&apos; autonomy in that country under British protection &quot;and to develop a system of self-government under an Egyptian ruler.The. object of Great Britain is to defend Egypt against all external danger and the interference of any foreign Power, and at the same time to establish a constitutional system in which, under British guidance as far as may be necessary, the Sultan, his Ministers and the elected representatives of the people may, in their several Spheres and in an increasing degiee, co-operate in the management of Egyptian affairs.His Majesty&apos;s Government has decided, to send to Egypt a mission which has as its task to work out details of a constitution to carry on this object, and, in consulta-tion with the Sultan, his Ministers and the representatives of the Egyptians, to undertake the preliminary work which is requisite before the future form of government can be settled.It is not the function of the mission to impose a constitution on Egypt. Its duty is to explore the ground ; to discuss in consultation with the authorities on the spot the reforms that are necessary, and to propose, it is hoped in complete agreement with the Sultan and his Ministers, a scheme of government which can subsequently be put into force.Summary of. Official Reports on the Disturbances. On 19th November Lord Curzoii telegraphed [No. 2073] to Lord Grey the following brief summary of official reports on the recent disturbances in Egypt in view of the exaggerated statements disseminated by the Nationalists : On 24th October a large crowd assembled outside the principal mosque at Alexandria, and on the police attempting to disperse it, they were stoned and were obliged to call for the assistance of the British troops. The rioters stoned the police and the troops, and. the latter were obliged to fire. Order was temporarily restored, but during the night of the 24th-25th barricades were erected in some of the streets by the rioters, and at 11 o&apos;c!stock on the morning of the 25th a British police officer reported that the situation was bad and that the roughs had complete control of the streets in one quarter of the city. A cinema theatre was set on fire at 12.30 p.m., and an abandoned motor lorry was burned. The Commandant of Police informed the military that assistance was needed. Troops were sent and again had to fire on the crowd, after which order was restored.The total casualties amongst the police were 47 ; amongst the crowd 7 were killed and 21 injured.   There were only minor casualties amongst British troops.On 31st October large demonstration took place in Alexandria. A. few people were injured by a British motor ambulance which ran into the crowd, whereupon the rougher elements attacked 13 shops, the looting lasting 1.5 minutes. Almost simultaneously in another quarter three Egyptian soldiers in a Government motor-car rushed through the district, the men discharging their rifles in the air and firing
some .90 shots, This excited the crowd who joined the other rioters, and at 3 p.m. further looting of a few shops and cafes occurred. At 3.30 p.m. the police had the situation in hand and British troops were not called on to intervene. Several natives are reported killed or wounded by bullets, probably fired by the Egyptian soldiers already mentioned, who are under arrest.On the night of 3rd November some British soldiers were attacked in Alexandria near the Military Hospital, and a sentry fired on. the aggressors, causing some casualties.On13th November minor demonstrations took place in Cairo and Alexandria, and were dispersed by the&apos; police, assisted in1 Alexandria by Egyptian troops. Casualties as Ear as at present known were very slight; &quot;New Ministry. On 21st November Lord Allenby reported [No. 1618] that Youssouf Wahba Pasha had formed a new Ministry as follows :-Prime Minister     - . - -   Youssouf Wahba Pasha.Justice -        -        - -  Ahmed Zouhfikar Pasha.Interior - Tewfik Messim Pasha.Public Works and War - -   Ismail Sirry Pasha.Wakfs    - Hussein Bey Darwiche.Communications - - -   Ahmed Ziwar Pasha.Public Instruction - -   Yehia Ibrahim Pasha.Agriculture - - - - Mohammed Ohetic Pasha. [N.B. The Times of 25th November had the following note on this Cabinet:   Yussuf Wahba Pasha, the new Prime Minister, has had considerable experience in Egyptian administration. In 1912 he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, while he also held office as Minister of Finance in Rushdi Pa.sha&apos;s Cabinets of April and December 1914, and of April 1919. He Idled the same office in Mahomed Said Pasha&apos;s late Cabinet. Wahba Pasha is a Copt. The last Coptic Prime Minister was the ill-fated Boutros Pasha. Ismail Sirry Pasha was created. K.C.M.G. in 1913. In April 1914, he was Minister of Public Works and War, and in December 1914, Minister of Public Works. Ahmed Ziver Pasha and Ahmed Zuhhkar Pasha also held office in the. late Cabinet.]Telegraphing on 23rd November [No. .1625] Lord Allenby said that lie was favourably impressed by Wahba, and in his opinion the Ministry was stronger and better than its predecessor. He had seen the Sultan and each member of the new Ministry : they appeared to be confident and united, and were all hopeful.Arrest of Nationalist Leaders. On (?) 20th November Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 1613] as follows : As I consider the leaders of the Zaghloulists here are mainly responsible for the present unrest, on 18th November I warned Mahmoud Pasha Soliman, President of the Central Committee, Ibrahim Pasha Said, Vice-President, and Abdurrahman Faluni, Secretary, to refrain from political agitation in any form and ordered the two Pashas to proceed to their country estates. They refused to obey my order and were arrested this morning.The Foreign Office transmitted this telegram to Lord Grey and added the following notes :-Mahmoud Pasha Soliman is father of Mohamed Pasha Mahmoud at present in America and is a wealthy notable of Assiout. Ibrahim Pasha Said is a member of the Legislative Assembly and very anti-British, he is of mediocre intelligence and education. Abdurrahman Fahmi was formerly in the Army and subsequently Mudir of Benisouff and later Assistant Director of the Wakfs, he is very licentious in morals and strongly anti-British in sentiments.Rumours of intended Assassinations. On 25th November Sir George Buchanan repeated [No. 715] to the Foreign Office a telegram he had sent to Cairo informing the. High Commissioner that information, of unknown reliability, had been received indicating an intention to assassinate him (the High Commissioner) when an occasion offered itself, and all the members of Lord milner&apos;s mission when they landed.PALESTINE.The. Hostility to Zionism.- On 12th November Colonel Meiuertzhagen telegraphed [No. 495] to the Foreign Office saying that the commander-iii-Ohief agreed with Lord
Curzon&apos;s draft [B.B.R. iv. page 3] with the exception of the first paragraph, which.he would like to begin with the following words : Any interference with religious customs, or holy places by adherents of any religion.,   ADEN.The Quhra Tribe. On 13th&quot; November the Resident at Aden reported [telegram unnumbered] that there were indications that the whole Quhra tribe had come over to-our side, not omitting the principal Shaykh who had been opposed to us Mahommed Zaid. The Mansab of Marawa, Sayed Abdul Kadir, was now the one active agent against us and the whole Sayed community,threatened him with deposition if he did not give way.Telegraphing again [no number] on 20th November the Resident reported that he had received a friendly letter from Idrisi promising his good offices. Also letters from Major Meek showing an improvement in the situation ; he (Major Meek) was impressing ,on the Quhra the necessity of immediately surrendering the Mission and informing them, of the arrival of the aeroplanes.INDIA.Conference of Princes. On 8th November [No. 1528 S., received 14thNovember] the Viceroy reported that on 5th November the Conference of Princes had passed the following resolution, which was moved by the Maharaja of Bikanir: The scheme for the composition of the Chamber of Princes which has been proposed by the Viceroy is warmly accepted by the Conference, which tenders-its grateful thanks to His Excellency and. to the Secretary of State for India- and expresses the earnest hope that in the course of the coming year the Chamber may he brought into being.At the same session the following resolution, moved by the Maharaja of Alwar,. was also carried :  The Conference is of opinion that-there should be a most careful examination of the suggestion that, to enable them to have a say in matters affecting their interests, the (? lesser) States should have a reasonable representation in the Chamber of Princes ; that, for tins purpose, a committee should be appointed- to report to the Conference, after due inquiry, on the possibility of this being-done ; that, as a matter of convenience the personnel of this committee should be the same as that&apos; of the committee appointed in connexion with the codi-fication of political, practice; and that the Government of India should be asked to provide the materials for the committee to work on, and also itself to-investigate the matter. /Telegraphing again on 9th November [No. 1529 S., received 14th November], the Viceroy reported that on the previous day the Maharaja of Gwalior, in a speech replying on behalf of the Princes to the one made by himself on 3rd November, had requested that an assurance of their abiding attachment and loyalty might be com-municated to His Majesty, together with an expression of their gratitude for his appreciation of their services during the war. Their Highnesses.also expressed their, deep gratitude for the assurance that a Chamber of Princes would be instituted when, the necessary preliminaries had been settled.Waziristan. The Viceroy reported on 11th November that the Mahsucls had refused the terms offered them, and that no reply had been received from the Tochi Waziris.Telegraphing again-on. 21st November [No. 157.10] he said that considerable-damage had. been clone by our aeroplanes, and that news from Mahsucl sources indicated many casualties. He also said that three turbulent sections of Ismail Khel, Machas and Achars had been intentionally and contumaciously absent when the Kazha Madda Ivhel jirga presented itself at Datta Khel on IBth November; and that, in consequence, on the following day air operations were undertaken en bloc against the villages of Ismail Khel and Zura-m A tsar and the desired
result achieved, the offending sections coming in that afteruooon and the whole tribe accepting our terms without reservation.Caliphate Day. On 17th November the Viceroy reported that the resolutions and speeches on Caliphate Day (17th October) were on the whole, moderate in tone. The Cabinet had received frOra one Yakub Husain exaggerated reports of alleged mass meetings of Mahomedans in (?) Bombay protesting against the partition of Turkey; but the number of persons present, according to information received, was really very small. On the. same day the Viceroy also reported that the Hindi-. Qandi [B.E.R. hi.; p 4] had advised the Moslems to follow up the Caliphate Day meetings with further demonstrations, such as boycotting the peace celebrations in December, unless satisfactory terms for Turkey were settled : he preached the essential unity of Hindu and Moslem feeling in regard to the Caliphate. This movement, the Viceroy said, was not supported by moderate opinion, but it had been taken up by the extremist Mahomedans of Bombay, the United Provinces and Punjab.. On the whole, Mahomedan feeling was described as very uneasy, and the Guildhall speech might not improve it. The reports from northern India showed generally that the feeling was acute.National Congress. On 17th November the Viceroy reported that preparations were going on apace for the meeting of the National Congress at Amritsar. Swami Shradanaud had boen elected Chairman of the Reception Committee. It was proposed to hold, simultaneously with the Congress, the meeting of the Moslem League at the same place.Economic Conditions. The Viceroy reported on 7th November as follows :   Relief operations in the Poona district and the Kathiawar Agency of the Bombay Presidency and gratuitous relief in the Ahmedhagar district have been closed. Numbers relieved : Bengal (incomplete figures): gratuitous, 1,950. Bihar and Orissa: works, 878; gratuitous, 44,847. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 4,451 ; gratuitous, 13,256. Central India: works, 3,400; gratuitous, 5,500. Central Pro-vinces: works, 3,148; gratuitous, 3,44.9. Bombay: gratuitous, 1.839. Madras: works, 59,100; gratuitous, 85,804. Hyderabad report not received. Relief operations have been closed from the end of October in the Central Provinces. Situation in Bengal has been relieved by large supplies of Burma rice. Prices are falling, and the demand for Burma rice has declined.Again on 14th November as &apos; follows : Relief operations in the Bombay Presidency, in the Bankura District of Bengal, and in the Angul District of Bihar and Orissa, and relief works in the Banka sub-division of the Bhagalpur District have been closed. Valedictory doles for the recipients of gratuitous relief are being dis-tributed in the Sadar sub-division of Bhagalpur. Numbers on relief :--Bihar and Orissa: works, 371; gratuitous, 29,476. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 3,051; gratuitous, 6.888. Central India: works, 3,400; gratuitous, 4,800. Hyderabad: works, 15,000; gratuitous, 15,000.   Madras figures not reported.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.The Neio Ontario Cabinet.-The following list appeared in The Times of 14th November :  President of the Council -         - Mr. E. C.

AUSTRALIA.Mandates--On 15th November the. Governor-General transmitted, the. following message from&apos;his Prime Minister :&apos;- -No answer, has been, received;,to.my..previous -urgent telegram. Over six months have passed since the &quot;Council of Four agreed to the mandate, for the Pacific Islands and nearly six months since the Treaty of Peace, containing basic terms of each class of mandate, was signed, yet the Supreme Councils approval has not been given. This is most unfortunate and causes my Government great embarrassment, and is calculated to create a serious situation. The Japanese are working assiduously to secure the trade of the Islands ; they are endeavouring to acquire titles to land and minerals and oil rights, and we do nothing failing a formal appointment as mandatory. I have sent the Prime Minister an urgent telegram in reply to one from him, setting out the urgency of a settlement. The position of the Government in view of the financial, economic, and general conditions, including Bolshevism and Sinn Fein, is sufficiently difficult in any case. * We are in the midst of an election campaign, and it is surely not too much to ask that this question of a mandate, which ought to have been settled long ago, should be dealt with at once. In reply Lord Milner sent the following message to Mr. Hughes:  Please refer to the Prime Ministers message to you on 15th October, in which he pointed out that the Council of the League, to which mandates have to be submitted, cannot be constituted till after formal ratification. This depends on deposit, which has not been found possible yet (see concluding words of Treaty), It is not our fault that, owing to the unfortunate action of the American Senate, the constitution of the Council of the League of Nations has been so long delayed and appears now to be altogether in jeopardy. I am sincerely sorry for the embarrassment which the delay causes you, but I can assure you that to us too it is intolerably embarrassing in many ways, and that, speaking for myself, I have left no stone unturned to put an end to it. It seems to me just possible that, in view of the long vista of uncertainty caused by the American situation, the four other principal Allied and Associated Powers may be induced to go ahead by themselves, and issue mandates without waiting for the constitution of League, leaving it to America to adhere if and when it suits her. This would not be altogether satisfactory, but would be better than the present position. Anyway, as a last resort I am trying it. Will let you. know at once if effort meets with any success.Loyalist Protest in Victoria. A message was received from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth on 25th November communicating a resolution which.had been adopted by a meeting representative of various loyalist bodies in the State of Victoria, held on 10th November. The resolution entered the emphatic protest of the meeting against the dishonest attempt made by the mis-called Irish Race Convention recently held in Melbourne to represent Australian sentiment as favouring the treasonable Sinn Fein efforts to disrupt the British Empire by establishing a hostile republic at its very doors. The resolution asserted that the lecent convention chiefly represented a section of Roman Catholic Irish together with a small anti-British element in the community. It ended with the assurance of the meeting to the British Government of the unswerving loyalty of Australian citizens generally to the integrity and solidarity of the Empire.Effect of adverse Exchange Rates. On 2.1.st November a telegram was received from the Governor-General of the Commonwealth in which lie stated that in consequence of the adverse exchange rates many persons were endeavouring to transmit large sums of money&apos; to the United States in settlement of trade accounts by means of money orders. The basis of adjustment under the Money Order Convention is that of 4&apos;87 dollars per pound sterling. The proposal was put forward to limit money orders to 201., but on the assumption that a similar practice had arisen in the transmission of remittances from England to the United States, the Government of the Commonwealth asked the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government.High Price of Silver. In a further telegram received on the same date the Government of the Commonwealth invite the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the desirability of adopting one of two proposals in view of the high price of silver. First, the reduction.of the size of. Australian coins,,or second,., the retention of&apos; the present size of the coins,&quot; but with a reduced silver content.Certificate of Origin in respect of Imported Goods. In a telegram received 10th October, the Secretary of State was informed that the Government of the Common-wealth had decided that a certificate of origin would be required in respect of goods
imported into the Commonwealth from certain neutral States, and from reconstructed States formerly in the Austrian Empire.- In ;a furthertelegrani&apos;receiver; 23th October, the decision; to&apos;: required consular certificate in1 thf absence1 of^ a certificate of origin in connexion - with the importation from all countries in which British&apos;Consuls wereSiiua^av^aWt^btded.&apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos;^&apos;&apos;-&apos;-&apos;In reply to the above the Secretary of State telegraphed on 13th November his fears that the proposed system would lead to serious difficulties as follows :-First, the payment for the required certificates of origin would constitute a tax upon imports from all. foreign countries into Australia. Secoud, goods manufactured by German or partly German firms in neutral, countries could not, be discriminated against owing to the abolition of the Statutory Black List. Third, there no longer exists the deterrent of detection and inclusion in the Statutory List which prevented neutral firms from making false statements as to the origin of their goods during the war. Fourth, the system would not be completely effective because it would not apply to goods exported to Australia via other British countries, and there is how no. prohibition against the entry of ex-enemy goods as such in the United Kingdom and the greater part of the Empire. In view of these difficulties the Secretary of State suggested that some system of examination of goods on arrival in Australia might prove a more expeditious and satisfactory method of enforcing the policy than a system of certificates of origin.NEW ZEALAND.Coolie Labour for Samoa. On 9th October the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governor-General of New Zealand that the question of the employment of Chinese coolies in Samoa had been discussed between His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking and Ahlo, the newly-appointed Chinese Consul at Samoa, who was to discuss the matter, before leaving for Samoa, with the Cousul-General at Canton.With reference to the above the Secretary of State telegraphed again on 17th October that he had received a telegram from the Consul-General at Canton to the effect that Ahlo had agreed to accept responsibility for the emigration scheme, and had suggested the engagement of coolies from his own district near Swatow. He further proposed that they should accompauy him when he himself went to Samoa, and asked for the proposed terms of contract. The Secretary of State suggested that the Governor-General should communicate direct on the matter with His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking.In a telegram received, at the Colonial Office on 21st November the Governor-General reported that the Chinese Commissioner at Samoa was being sent to China that week with authority to enter into a contract and to supervise the shipment of coolies.   The contract proposed was based on that of 1913.SOUTH AFRICA.An Appeal for Unity. ReuteFs Agent reported on 14th November that General Smuts, who was making a tour of the Western Transvaal, speaking at a meeting at Welverclietid, said that it was nonsense for General Hertzog in his recent manifesto to the &quot; Afrikander people &quot; to suggest that the country was on the verge of ruin, bank-, ruptcy, and possible revolution, as the condition of South Africa was never more promising. General Smuts commented on the fact that the manifesto did not contain a word about a Republic. It had been whispered to him that the Republican idea was not popular in the Cape or.the Transvaal. Referring to the existing divisions among the Dutch people, General Smuts declared that if they remained steadfast these divisions would be removed. General Hertzog&apos;s manifesto, he said, was purely destructive, and he ridiculed the idea that the farmers had lost 10,000,000/. on the sale of wool. The elections were coming in 1920, but he did not know the exact date. The South African Party must then fight on its own feet.Appealing for both Dutch and British support, General Smuts referred to Switzerland, where, he said, three races formed one patriotic nation. There was an enthusiastic outburst of cheering&apos;when a prominent local Nationalist assured General Smuts of his support, and said that he hoped other Nationalists wouldfolfow his lead.&apos; The Asiatic Question.   Reuter&apos;s agent reported on 13th November. that in replying to. a deputation of his constituents on the Asiatic question, the Minister of
sJustice, Mr. de Wet, said that the Government had agreed, that the menace must be dealt with ; but they must proceed along a definite line and not indulge in panic legislation or action not definitely conclusive. The Government, he added, was not championing the cause of the Asiatics, but the questiou demanded a cooFhead. and a regard for justice and right. Hence the Government had agreed to the Indian Governments sending a representative. When the Commission of Enquiry had reported, the country, and not merely the Government, would have to decide whether they would agree to the necessary taxation for repatriating and compensating Indians not born in South Africa. In view of the fact that political capital was being made out of the cpiestion, the Minister emphatically denied that the Government was doing the bidding of the Imperial Government in this question.The Gold Problem. Reuter&apos;s agent reported on .15th November that Mr. Farrer, Union Secretary for Finance, giving evidence before the Low Grade Mines Commis-sion, had expressed the opinion that the establishment of a free gold market in South Africa at present would lead to an efflux of sovereigns from the Union, and that it would only be possible to replace these sovereigns at a rate of 23s. Sd,, which would react unfavourably on the mines. The present selling arrangement appeared to secure the highest possible price. When the premium on the American Exchange disappeared, it was very probable there would still be a small premium on gold for India, but gold generally would be sold at the standard price. The best price for gold would then be obtained by minting locally.Zionism. On 17th November EeuteFs agent reported that at a big deinonstra-tion in Johannesburg held to celebrate the second anniversary of the British Governments declaration in favour of a Jewish Palestine, General Smuts referred to the oiitbreak of anti-Jewish persecution in Eastern Europe, and said that General Botha had resigned the chairmanship oE the Polish Commission at the Peace Conference owing to the atrocities in Poland ; he declared that Zionism was the only remedy for Jewish persecution, and praised the Jews for steadfastly maintaining their national ideals. Mr. BalfonFs declaration concerning the future of Palestine could be regarded as certain of realization after the conclusion oE the treaty with Turkey. Britain would redeem her pledge despite the difficulty and the delicacy, of the position, and a great Jewish State would ultimately arise.NEWFOUNDLAND.New Ministry. Telegraphing on 18th November the Governor of Newfoundland informed the Secretary of State that Mr. Cashin had sent in his resignation from 15th November, and that a new Ministry had been appointed, from 17th November, with Mr. Richard Anderson Squires as Prime Minister, and Mr. William Ford Coaker as his chief colleague. The names of other members of the new Ministry were not telegraphed.ft
