The Labour Situation. The following paragraph is taken from the Report on: the Labour Situation for the week ending 24th March: -The Labour situation is again dominated by difficulties with regard to wages in the coal-mining industry and on the railways. On the miners&apos; demands for an advance of 3s. per shift for adults and Is. Qd. per shift for junior workers negotia-tions are still proceeding. The application of the A..S.L.E;-and F. for an advance on the standard rates granted in. August last is at present being considered by the Railway Wages Board, and, discussion is also taking place on the question of the adjustment of wages in accordance with the sliding scale agreement recently reached between the Government and the N.U.R., There is also unrest on the London Electric Railways owing to the delay in applying to these railways the advantages under the national settlement, and a strike of&quot; Lancashire and Yorkshire railwaymen at Wakefield has taken place owing to grievances against the control system and the one-day suspension of a driver. The various demands of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for increased wages: for dockers, omnibus and tramway workers, and commercial road transport workers-are still under consideration. Thus, it is noteworthy that there is at present unrest and dissatisfaction of an acute kind in all the industries associated in the Triple Alliance. Although nothing has been heard of that organization for a long time, it should not be forgotten that by an; agreement reached at its last meeting on the 27th November, it was provided that a meeting of the Alliance should be called in the event of any of the associated Unions failing, to obtain their demands.CROWN COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.FIJI.Indian Labourers&apos; Strihe [B.E.R., xii., p. 2]. On 18th March Sir Cecil Rodwell telegraphed the following summary of a petition addressed to the Government by numerous Indians of Suva and district :-Lo3ral Indians respectfully . ask the Government to take steps to - punish. the ^agitators responsible for the recent troubles among Indians. We feel that many who have been committed to gaol have been incited to.do acts, for which, they have been punished, by leaders who are still at large, and we pledge ourselves to render to the Government every assistance in our power to bring the agitators to justice.INDIA.27ie Caliphate Question [B.E.R., xiii., p. 3]. The following telegram from the Viceroy, dated 7th March, was received by the India Office on 17th March :--The Mohamedan situation has become more difficult during the past week as the direct result of home agitation for the expulsion of the Sultan from Constantinople. The speeches delivered in the House of Commons debate, and, more particularly, the challenge of Lord Bryce that Moslems were not really seriously concerned about the fate of the Turks, the speech of Lord Robert Cecil, and the participation in the campaign of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other ecclesiastical dignitaries, which has given the agitation the semblance of a struggle between Cross and Crescent. These unfortunate proceedings had provoked a fanatical outburst in Bengal, where the Caliphate conference was held on 28th and 29th February, and the speeches made, and the resolutions passed, were more openly seditious than anything hitherto reported, including a resolution expressing indignation against the attitude of the Christian prelates, and threatening that if the dominion of the Caliph were not kept intact, Indian Moslems must cease all relations of loyalty with Britain, and assist the Caliph against all enemies; and a resolution expressing the devotion of Indian
Moslems to the person of the present Sultan as the Caliph of the Moslem world. Another stated that as the expulsion of the Turks from Constantinople was asserted to be a matter of no concern to Indian Moslems, it had become necessary to prove the opposite by the adoption of the extreme measures hitherto avoided, namely, the universal suspension of business on 19th March, a message to the Viceroy and - King-Emperor, severing all connexion with the British Government if the decision were contrary to Islamic law, and an appeal for the co-operation of Hindus and of Indian -States. This resolution was supported by. two members of the Bengal Legislative Council, who placed letters of resignation with the President of the meeting for use when required. Other resolutions urged on all Moslems the adoption of a complete boycott of British piece goods, and expressed sympathy with the efforts of the Turkish nationalists, Mustapha Kamal and Enver Pasha, to preserve the integrity of the Caliphate. Most of these resolutions were supported with speeches of great violence, offering sacrifices of life and property in the cause of Islam. These resolutions and speeches are/ doubtless mainly the hysterical outburst&apos; of highly emotional people, but the&apos; open expression of- disloyalty, although conditional, is a danger signal, and may lead to, at any rate, local disorder. We have consulted the Bengal and other Local Governments regarding measures to be adopted to deal with the situation and to check further extension of a campaign of violence, recognizing on the one hand the danger that action against individuals may precipitate&apos; trouble, and on the other hand the danger that the fanaticism of the masses may be excited to disorder point by unchecked, agitation. Meanwhile we should like to know whether the decision of the Peace Conference, regarding the retention of the Sultanate in Constantinople, can be announced as final, and whether it is possible to say anything that Would allay Moslem feeling regarding the holy places of Bejaz. It would be a great relief to know by what date the announcement of the Turkish terms, may be expected, and it is important that we should receive information regarding these at least a week in advance. Please inform us if this is possible.Reporting on the same question, the Viceroy telegraphed on 18th March as follows: Bengal is still the storm centre of the Caliphate agitation. The Calcutta Caliphate Committee has organized a campaign of intensive propaganda, and the situation is deteriorating, moderate respectable men being threatened, and the lower orders being directly approached. Inflammatory leaflets are being distributed inculcating the peaceful observance of Hartal, and subsequent action, regardless of consequences, if the result is not favourable. The leaflet has been proscribed by the Local Government. In other provinces the feeling is less strong, except in Sind, Bombay, where similar intensive propaganda have been carried out. In the Punjab the aim is said to be rather to impress moderate Europe with the strength of the feeling than to embarrass the Government, here. Hartal will bo generally observed, and in some places mass meetings will be held on the 19th. Hindus have been asked to participate, but there is no enthusiasm among Hindus, except extiemists, who are encouraging the Caliphate agitation as a political move. Disorder is not anticipated generally, but the Local Governments have taken police and military precautions to deal with the situation should there be sporadic outbreaks. We have considered the question of issuing&quot; a public pronouncement defining the Government attitude, and warning against violence, but as the Local Governments, except Bengal, have generally advised that this would do more harm than good, we have decided not to issue the resolution. To Bengal, however, we have left discretion to take such action as may be deemed necessary to prevent or check disorder.A meeting of Hindu and Moslem leaders will be held in Bombay on the 17th, to cousider the Caliphate question as proposed by His Highness Aga Khan, who, in addressing the Central Caliphate Committee at Bombay, emphasized the difficulties of the Caliphate problem, and his sympathy with Mohamedans of Anglo-Indian and non-official European communities. In one respect we have taken direct action. In a recent manifesto Shaukat Ali called upon Government servants in civil, military and police employment, to join in the observance of Hartal, suggesting that this would stiffen the Government of India&apos;s support of representations made by the Caliphate deputation now in England. AVe have issued orders Calling attention to Rule 22 of Government Servants&apos; Conduct Rules, and stating that no exception can be made of 19th March, especially as the resolutions to be put before meetings on that clay declare that if the peace terms are not acceptable to Moslems they must sever loyal connexion with the British Throne: all Moslem Government servants have accordingly been warned that if they take part in these proceedings they do so at their own risk.
Jamslvedpiir Strike [B.E.R.,xiii., p. 4]. On the same date the Viceroy sent this report: There have been no lawless developments. On 4th March there were signs that the strike was breaking up. Negotiations were proceeding on 6th March, and the manager of the company was wiring for instructions from the head office. On 6th and 7th March nothing happened. On the 8th a mass meeting was held at which terms were placed before the men, viz., return to work by 6 .p.m. of^ the 9th March, and then, if they did so,&apos; a general amnesty, all, including ringleaders, being allowed to return, and to draw pay up to the 23rd February, the day preceding the commencement of the strike. The company would then consider other grievances, and the question of granting pay for the period of the strike. The manager agreed to the conditions of an all-round increase in pay, if the company could afford it, otherwise the increase would be given first in the lower paid grades ; the inquiry into the proposed rates of wages to be completed in six weeks. In the event of refusal, these terms would be withdrawn and the men only allowed to return with the permission of the manager in individual cases. These terms were refused, but the men indicated that a final answer would be given on the 9th. On the 9th a letter was received from Mr. Haldar explaining the attitude of the workers : a meeting of the men was called, at which the Deputy Commissioner explained that the company could not continue to sell grain at privileged rates, but would sell at market rate as long as supplies lasted, and would pay the men up to the 23rd February and give them railway tickets home. He urged them to reply in a peaceful manner. On the 12th March the men intimated their final refusal of the terms, and presented their demands, the chief being: (1) A 15 per cent, increase of wages, less than eight annas per day before the strike, liable to a further increase or a reduction upon the result of examined statistics prior to the period of the strike ; (2) no discharge ; (3) all other questions to be considered sympathetically, the most important being a 35 to 50 per cent, increment, provision against accidents and death, a bonus, annual leave, holidays, sick leave, casual leave, medical attendance including nurses and midwives, cattle dispensary, and veterinary treatment, shorter hours of work and railway facilities.Disturbances were considered likely when the final reply of the directors was received. Fifty mounted police accordingly were despatched to reinforce .100 British infantry and 200 armed Military Police, already assembled. On the night of the 13th mobs collected and several molested the workers. The above forces were inadequate to protect the workers and maintain the light and water supply. The General Officer Commanding the brigade asked for 300 Indian troops. On the 14th a determined mob stoned the workers, the police and the troops, but there was no firing. Troops were despatched from Dinapore. On the morning of the 15th a collision occurred between the- police and strikers tampering with the railway. The police were compelled to fire, with the consequent casualties of three strikers killed and eleven wounded.   All is quiet at present.Continuing under date of 20th March, the Viceroy further reported the following: Further information, received shows that feeling became intense on the night of the 13th. During that night and all clay of the 13th lathis were brought in by strikers from the neighbouring jungles, and on the night of the 13th a determined and well organized cordon of about 10,000 men was drawn, round the factory. The strikers engaged in picketing to prevent any workers going on the 10 p.m. shift. Practically there was no labour on all the 13th. Inflammatory speeches were delivered by some of the leaders. On the same night, armed bodies of strikers collected near (corrupt group) over the town. The Deputy Commissioner manned the gate of the factory with police. In spite of this, next morning the factory was practically besieged, the strike leader declaring that no Indians would be allowed to get in to work. On the morning of the 14th, a motor lorry bringing food to willing workers was greeted by hostile demonstrators, stones and brickbats being thrown at the drivers and the escorting troops. By tact and promptitude the Deputy Cornmis-sioner averted a collision, the men being addressed and urged to disperse. Negotia-tions proceeded during the clay, but to no purpose. Picketing continued throughout the night, and no workmen were allowed to enter the works. On the morning of the &apos; 15th it was discovered that the railway lines had been tampered with. The Deputy Inspector-General ordered two parties of mounted police to arrest the offenders, with instructions not to fire unless it were in self-defence, but they were to arrest as many as possible, using swords if resistance was offered. About 40 arrests were made, but the prisoners were rescued, and a mob of strikers in large numbers attacked the police, who were compelled to fire in self-defence, Mr. Ashby and several police being
severely injured, five killed and 21 wounded. The police fell back on the works and fired only when closely pressed. The Deputy Commissioner arrived on the scene and again calmed the mob. The bodies of the dead were sent to the police station and the injured men were taken to the hospital, where they received every attention from the medical officers. The Deputy Magistrate was at once ordered to hold an inquest. The situation improved rapidly, but the police were patrolling day and night to protect those who have resumed work. On the 17th the situation was much better, and some 2,000 men resumed work. The directors arrived on the morning of the 18th, and have notified the strikers, giving them till 6 a.m. if satisfied to return to work, and also stating that if a sufficient number of men returned to enable work to commence the Committee would announce their decision on the men&apos;s demands. The effect was.favourable, and by the evening of the .18th, according to Press telegrams, 15,000 men, equal to 50 per cent., had rejoined and the rest were expecting to jpin on Saturday. We have invited the Lieutenant-Governor to intervene if a suitable opportunity occurs, and Sir T. Holland has also offered his services.Negotiations with Afghanistan. The Viceroy reported [300 S.] on loth March the view of-the Indian Government. that nothing should be published regarding, the proposed conversations with Afghanistan of which the Bolsheviks might take advantage in their negotiations with that country. The Bolsheviks appeared to be suspicious of Afghan intention to desert towards us, and it would be desirable not to give publicity to anything which might undeceive them or check the development of friction between them and the Afghans. The Indian Government proposed the following communique : One of the terms of the treaty of peace signed with Afghanistan on 8th August last was that (? should the) Afghans prove by their acts and conduct that they were sincerely anxious to regain the friendship of the British Govern-ment, the latter would be prepared to receive another Afghan mission after six months for discussion and settlement of matters of common interest to the two Governments and re-establishment of old friendship on a satisfactory basis.Since then, the course of Afghan politics has been obscure. Although the few communications received from.Kabul have been friendly in tone.there has been little proof in fact of any real wish on the part of the Afghan Government to cultivate our friendship. The Amir made the first communication by putting forward a proposal for a conference of British and Afghanistan officials on the border to settle frontier affairs, but this proposal could not, in the circumstances, be accepted. The Amir was, however, told in reply that the British Government were prepared to permit a discussion between representatives of the two Governments with the limited object of clearing away misunderstandings, of frankly examining any obstacles which may now he, in the way of good relations, and of preparing a firm foundation on which a treaty of friendship can be erected at a later date. The Amir has welcomed the idea of such a discussion, and conversations with this object are about to take place at Mussoorie between representatives of the Government of India and of the Afghan Govern-ment. These conversations will be purely preliminary and informal and will not have as their aim the immediate conclusion of a definite treaty of friendship.Afghan Speculation in Rouble Notes. On 24th March the Viceroy transmitted a telegram from General Malleson in which he stated that Turkestan was getting alarmed by the influx of Afghan rouble notes. The leading Afghan merchants had been send-officially assured that the Amir, in the forthcoming negotiations with the Indian Government, would stipulate, as one of the conditions on which he would insist, for the removal of Indian restrictions by which the Afghans had been hard hit in their heavy speculations in rouble notes.The Frontier Situation.-Tl\e Viceroy telegraphed [325 S.] on 20th March a brief review of the frontier situation of which the following gives a resume :- (1) North of the Kabul River the situation among the tribes is about normal, and little success is attending the efforts of a few mullahs to arouse anti-British feeling ; (2) in the Afridi country the surrender of Government rifles had been proceeding steadily, but since the Nada jirga, very few have been received, and the maliks profess that-they cannot enforce compliance with our terms until the Afghan situation is cleared up. A state of unrest exists among the tribes, but raiding is confined to the Zakka Khel section, 13-5 &apos; B
while the others loyally abide by their promises not to raid themselves, and to intercept dacoits within their boundaries; .(8) in the Kurram area the attitude of the tribes is satisfactory. Nearly the whole of the rifles due from them have been sent in by the Orakzais. An additional brigade has strengthened the&quot; Kohat-Kurram Force, while the recent local levies in the Miranzai A7alley have been doing good work in the suppression of raids throughout this district; (4) in Northern AVaziristan the situation is fairly satisfactory. The Tochis and Waziris have resumed the payment of fines and the delivery of rifles since the Mahsud resistance collapsed. The Mahsud leaders appear to appreciate the futility of further resistance, but it is likely that a prolonged occupation of the commanding positions now held in the country will be necessary to secure full compliance with our terms. Much further serious resistance is not anticipated; (5) no operations will be necessary against the Sherannis who have practically complied with our terms; (6) outlaws from Zhob and Suliman Khel have recently carried out minor raids across the border; (7) the governing factor on the frontier is the attitude of Afghanistan, who, it is daily clearer, counts on the fighting qualities of the tribes on the British North1 West Frontier to support her, without which she would scarcelydare to attack us again. If we deprived her of hopes of this support, by bringing the tribes more under our control, it would be the best insurance against Afghan enterprise, and could be best effected by increased expenditure ; (8) Kabul shows no signs of military activity, and public opinion is said to be anticipating the best results from the hoped for &quot; Friendship Treaty &quot; with India, which renders the resumption of hostilities unlikely. Negotiations with the Bolsheviks have taken more definite form, but there are indications of mutual suspicion. In many quarters of Afghanistan the Bolsheviks are not regarded with favour, and interesting developments may result from the present friction on the Herat border ; (9) a general summary of the situation shows, that the punishment administered to the Mahsuds is having salutary effects else-where, the want of material help to the tribes from Afghanistan is working in our favour, and, on the whole, there is a marked improvement.THE DOMINIONS.The Mandate for New Guinea. On 17th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies communicated to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the terms of a draft convention relating to the mandate for the German possessions South of the Equator, other than Samoa and Nauru.Parties to Treaties. On 16th March the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and the Officer Administering the Government of Canada, asking whom their Governments wished to nominate as their representatives for the signature of treaties with Greece and other Powers.Clearing Offices for the Settlement of German Debts. On 24th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the OEicer Administering the Government of Canada, and to the Governors-General of Australia and New Zealand as follows : The Annex to Article 296 of the German Treaty provides that each High Contracting Party will within three months of the notification under paragraph E. set up a Clearing Office for the settlement of debts and that local Clearing Offices may be established for any portion of its territories. In accordance with the provisions of Article 296 (e) notice has beeu given on behalf of your Government as well as those of all other parts of the Empire, except the Union of South Africa and Egypt, of the adoption of the Clearing Office system. The question now arises as to the method of application of the Article. There appear to be two alternatives. The first is for each Dominion to establish a Central Clearing Office which would be entirely distinct from the office in London, would communicate directly with the German Clearing Office, and would appoint a representative in Germany and receive a German representative under paragraph 12 of the Annex. It is possible that difficulties might be raised by the German Government to this course which would have to be settled either by diplomatic means or possibly by a decision of the Mixed Arbitral Tribunal.The second alternative is as follows : His Majesty&apos;s Government is willing that the Central Clearing Office established here should act as agent for the Dominions
concerned as well as for the United Kingdom and other portions of the Empire, if this course be desired. In that case the Clearing Offices in the Dominions would be technically, as towards the German Government, Local Offices using the Central British Clearing Office as the channel of communication with the German Clearing Office, and the services of the representative of the British Clearing Office in Germany and his staff would be at the disposal of the Dominions. Internally, however, the offices in the Dominions would perform all the functions of a Central Clearing Office and would have full power of collecting and paying debts. Any balance in their favour would be retained by them, and such share in any German payment actually effected under paragraph 11 of the Annex as arises in respect of debts to and from the Dominions would be paid to them. On the other hand the Dominions would have to accept responsibility for debts owing by British nationals resident in the Dominions and/or any amount by which the sums collected by them fell short of the sums paid by them to persons in their territories. It would be necessary, of course, to make a small charge towards the administrative cost of the Central British Clearing Office, the representative in Germany, &amp;c.Another possible course might have been to pool all German assets under British control as a common fund to meet the claims of all British nationals, wherever resident, entitled to rank against the charge on such assets- see section 1 (xvi), Order in Council, enclosed in my Despatch of 5th November, No. 811 (Dominions) but it is doubtful whether this is practicable. The Government of the Union of South Africa have already decided to restore the property of German nationals domiciled in the Union at the outbreak, of war, and to satisfy out of the balance the claims of British subjects domiciled in the Union.I should be glad to learn as early as possible the views of your Ministers. It should be added that, if the German assets in the Dominions are not to come into a common pool with those in the United Kingdom, the Colonies, and the Protectorates, it will, be necessary, whichever of the two alternatives be adopted, to exclude from the charge on the assets in the United Kingdom, the Colonies, and the Protectorates under the Order in Council the claims of British nationals resident in the Dominions.CANADA.Representation at Washington. On 24th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies replied as follows to the telegram received from the Governor-General of Canada on 5th March [B.E.R., xiii., p. 6] :-With regard to the form of the public announcement suggested in your telegram of 4th March, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asks that the words &quot;reside and &quot; in para. 2 and the whole of para. 3 may be omitted. It would be quite impossible in fact for the new Minister to reside in the present Embassy; and if there is to be any hope of buying a new site at a reasonable price, it will be advisable that all reference to the question of residence or the necessity of building a new Embassy be omitted.As regards the remainder of the statement, other than the last paragraph, we think that the following alterations, if acceptable to your Government, would be an improvement. For the phrase &quot; to provide for Canadian diplomatic representation at Washington,&quot; read &quot;to provide for the more complete representation of Canadian interests at Washington than has hitherto existed &quot; ; and instead of the phrase &quot;conduct them direct with the United States Government,&quot; read &quot; will at all times &apos;&apos; be the ordinary channel of communication with the United States Government in &quot; matters of purely Canadian interest.&quot; It is also suggested, for the consideration of your Government that it would be well to add a sentence as to the maintenance of the principle of the diplomatic unity of the Empire.Relations with the British W\est Indies. On 25th March the Officer Adminis-tering the Government of Canada sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : A Minute of Council dated 23rd March dealt with the question of the commercial and transport relations between Canada and the British. possessions in the West Indies aud referred to the marked growth of trade resulting, from the Canadian preferences of 1897, the arrangement with the West Indian Colonies of 1912, the establishment of a steamship and cable service, and the financial aids provided by Canadian Banks. Attention is drawn to the resolution passed by the Associated West Indian Chamber of Commerce of last February urging the assembly of representatives of the Imperial, Canadian and West Indian Governments to consider the development
of trade relations and cognate matters. My Ministers believe that the above considera-tions with the changed conditions brought about by the war, and the renewed interest in the West Indies and in Canada make it advisable that a conference should be held at an early period between representatives of all the British West Indian Colonies and the. Government of Canada for the purpose of considering the whole question of trade relations and transport facilities between these countries and Canada, with a view to their improvement. The present time being opportune and sentiment favourable, the following basis for the suggested conference is submitted for your consideration and for such action as you may think advisable : (I) That each separate West Indian Administration and the Administration of British Honduras be invited to send one representative to the conference; (2) that the Government of Canada shall appoint such representatives as they &quot;think necessary ; (3) the Secretary of State may, if he sees fit, nominate one or more persons to attend the conference, but that such person or persons shall not vote on any question before the conference; (4) that each of the above-mentioned Administrations may appoint such experts or advisers as it deems necessary to assist its representatives, but these shall not have any voting power; (5) that each&apos; Administration shall provide for the expenses of its own representatives, and that any necessary joint expense shall be borne, one half by the Government of Canada and one half by the Administrations represented ; (6) that the conference be held at Ottawa at a convenient date in May, a.place of conference being provided by the Government of Canada ; (7) that all questions be decided by a majority of votes, the Government of Canada reserving the right to declare that any proposition not acceptable to it shall not be,entertained ; (8) that the conclusions arrived at in the conference shall be reported for acceptance or rejection, as a whole, to the legislatures represented at the conference, ancl shall come into force when accepted by these legislatures and approved by the Government of Canada and His Majesty&apos;s Government.Offer of Ships by the Admiralty. On 25th March the Officer Administering the Government of Canada telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies with reference to the latter&apos;s telegram of 20th September: My Ministers represent that the Canadian Government are most grateful for the Admiralty&apos;s offer of vessels for use in the Canadian Navy, and they will be glad to accept two destroyers and one light cruiser of the Bristol type. The details (? of the capacity) required will be communicated later, and (regarding) the Canadian officer proceeding to England to arrange the transfer, choice of crews, &amp;c. The Minister of Naval Service desires to obtain information as to the type of destroyer available.Trade Returns. The Director of Information announced on 17th March that the trade returns for February indicated a total external trade for that month amounting approximately to $170,000,000, an increase of $28,000,000 over that for February 1919, Also that the export trade for January was divided as follows : One-third with the United Kingdom, one-third, with the United States, and one-third with other countries.Naval Organization. According to an announcement of the Director of Information made on 24th March, the Canadian naval organization is to be practically demobilized, ancl the dockyards at Esquimalt and Halifax will be closed pending the adoption of a permanent policy.The Prime Minister. Sir Robert Borden telegraphed to his parliamentary supporters on 12th March that he was continuing to make satisfactory progress, ancl expected to return to Ottawa a month before the prorogation of Parliament.Nickel Coinage. Sir Henry Drayton, Minister of Finance, has announced that arrangements are in progress for the introduction of a nickel coinage.Dominion Notes and Gold. Sir Henry Drayton has also stated that, due regard &quot;being had to the country&apos;s interests, the redemption of Dominion notes in gold would be resumed at the first practical opportunity.AUSTRALIA.Wool. On 20th March the Governor-General of Australia telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply to the lattePs telegram of 25th February [B.E.R., xii., p. 7] :-The Commonwealth Government regrets that the full information which was asked for is not available.    It quite understands the difficulties of His Majesty&apos;s
Government; owing to the intricacy and magnitude of the wool transactions, but is strongly of opinion that the system of accounts adopted should afford much fuller information and enable the Australian growers tou-eceive their share of the profits due &apos;to date. The Commonwealth Government notes that His Majesty&apos;s Government is unable to assent to the proposals made in my previous telegram for the payment forthwith of the Australian share of tho profits, and that such profits should be paid hereafter as and when sales are made, but is unable to appreciate the reason for refusal.As the Commonwealth Government sees the position, such a proposal is at once reasonable and proper. Certainly it does not seem fair that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should have the immediate use of all the very large profits which have been made on sales of the greater portion of the wool sold since the armistice, and in addition be in a position to tax the wool indttstry 80 per cent, of all profits made by private manufacturers and merchants in combing, spinning, weaving, and selling out wool, whilst the Commonwealth Government, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer well knows, is being pressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government for moneys due by it to Great Britain for the maintenance of Australian troops during the war, and yet is unable to tax half of the profits of the Australian growers or even to obtain accurate information as to what these profits are, so that it might be enabled to adjust its financial difficulties, and at the same time it is threatened with being posted as a defaulter in the House of Commons. It is therefore the Governments earnest hope that its reasonable request regarding the wool accounts and payment thereon may be agreed to.Dairy Producis-On 24th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies received a telegram from the Governor-General of Australia informing him that the represen-tatives of the Inter-State Conference of Dairymen had considered the question of the sale to His Majesty&apos;s Government of surplus butter and cheese for a further period of 12 months, and desired the Government to urge their wish for a free market. If, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided that it was necessary to continue the control of dairy products they would be much obliged for the earliest possible infor-mation as to the nature of the control proposed to be exercised, and particularly if it would involve the purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government of foreign butter as heretofore.   In that event the producers were willing to negotiate.Application for Permission to sell Horses to Germany. On 23rd March the Governor-General of Australia informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that an application had been made to the Government of the Commonwealth for permission to ship horses to Germany. It was against the expressed policy of the Commonwealth Government to permit trade with that country except under very exceptional circum-stances ; and as it understood that Germany was not carrying out the Treaty provisions with regard to the delivery of stock to the Allies, the Government of the Common-wealth would be glad to have the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to whether it was considered desirable to grant the desired permission.NEW ZEALAND.The United States Senate Reservations. On 24th March the Governor-General of New Zealand informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Government had adopted the same position as the Canadian Government in regard to the United States reservations [B.E.R., xiii., p. 5], but that it desired to leave absolutely to the discretion of the Impeilal Government the decision as to a protest being made to the United States against the terms of the Lenroot reservation.Mandates. On 17th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of New Zealand in the same terms as he had telegraphed to the Governors-General of South Africa and Australia on 12th March. [B.E.R., xiii., p. 5.JMeat. On 22nd March the following telegram was sent by the Governor-General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply to his of 13th March [B.E.R., xiii., p. S] :-Your telegram of 13th March intimated that contracts for the supply of New Zealand meat to the Imperial Government would terminate on 30th June next; the Prime Minister states that this decision is causing considerable anxiety here, and he feels jt is necessary that he should explain the position more fully than has already 13-5 1        c
&quot;been clone. He therefore desires to state that the freezing season is supposed to end with June, hut as past experience has shown, there will be approximately 500,000 . carcases of meat coming into the stores after that date. Then the off season lasts till .the middle, of November when some North Island works commence operations for the new season ; but probably more than 500,000 carcases go into cold storage prior to .31st December. It is quite certain that with several millions of carcases of Imperial meat in store even (? at the end of) this year the position will be very awkward, and some arrangement will have to be made by which producers will be able to get at least a fair proportion of their meat to the English market. This renders it necessary that all that is possible should be done to secure the amount of shipping necessary to take the whole of the Imperial meat away from the Dominion. The Prime Minister would again suggest that in view of the facts set but herein the commandeer should last until, say, 1st December next. The effect would be purely nominal as far as the new supplies are concerned, but it would give producers time to make the necessary arrangements and give the Imperial Government time to get their meat awav. The Prime Minister therefore hopes that this will be considered favourably so as to avoid what may possibly be a very serious financial difficulty.SOUTH AFRICA.The Native Question. On 18th March, ReuteFs Capetown agent reported that Dr. Furse, the Bishop of Pretoria, before leaving for his new diocese, Saint Aibans, had addressed an important open letter to General Smuts on the native policy of the Union, in the course of which he said :  &quot; The only way to save South Africa from serious harm is to face the facts. For the past decade the Bantu peoples as a whole throughout South Africa have shown a remarkable growth of race consciousness and have come to resent the idea that they exist merely for the exploitation of their labour for the white man&apos;s benefit. As they often say themselves, they are a &apos; voiceless people,&apos; and are more and more smarting under a sense of injustice, created by the accumulation of a number of grievances.&quot; He believed that impartial investigation would show these grievances to be most real.&quot; In spite of asseverations to the contrary, the natives are strongly under the impression that native questions in practice are at the mercy of party political considerations as much as any others, except that they receive far less attention than the questions directly affecting Europeans. Hitherto the natives have been extra-ordinarily law abiding, but if the policy of drift is allowed to continue, the peace and prosperity of the country will be most seriously menaced.&quot; As remedies, he proposed the appointment of three native commissioners and the establishment of native councils in various provinces to which all legislation affecting the natives should be submitted.He anticipated that these councils, which would be purely advisory, would develop on the one hand into local councils and on the other into a central council representing the whole Union; these bodies gradually acquiring increased powers. Furthermore, he advocated separate estimates of revenue and expenditure as affecting the natives, showing the value which they obtained from the taxation they paid. He considered that it was essential, even though the Government should not adopt the recommendations of the three native commissioners, that their recommendations be published. His proposals were not new, but he believed that they would very largely remove the sense of real grievance which, unless speedily removed, would react adversely not only upon the natives but upon the whole Union. He looked to General Smuts as to one having the fearlessness and driving force needed to carry through the policy outlined.Cost of Living. On 22nd March ReuteFs Capetown agent reported that in the House of Assembly the Government had that day promised on the motion of Colonel Creswell to appoint a select Committee to consider the effect on the cost of living of the present embargo on the export of specie. Also that immediately after the adjournment, General Smuts, standing on the steps of the Parliament House, received a deputation representing two thousand women who had marched in procession from the City Hall in order to hand him a copy of a resolution claiming precedence for legislation tending to reduce the cost of living, and protesting against the &quot; appalling conditions which made life unbearable to a large majority of families in South Africa.&quot;Profits of State-owned Steamers. In his telegram of 22nd March ReuteFs Capetown agent further said that Mr. Burton, the Minister of Railways and Harbours,
introducing additional railway and harbour estimates, had announced that the three State-owned -steamers had earned a profit of 88,0001. during the current financial year on the basis of the current freight rates.The Air-Flight to South Africa. On 22nd March the Governor-General of South Africa telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : My Ministers request me to convey to the Air Ministry their warm appreciation of the high enterprise and foresight of His Majesty&apos;s Government in laying out the aerial route from Cairo to Capetown, thus making possible the accomplishment of the wonderful air journey from London to Capetown by Wing Commander Van Ryneveld and Flight Lieutenant Brand, despite all difficulties, dangers ancl mishaps. The Government of the Union of South Africa is deeply indebted to the Royal Air Force for making these two South African officers available and for the invaluable assistance they were given, more particularly at Cairo, by the placing of another aeroplane at their disposal and the assembling of it for the trans-continental flight. The Government of the Union of South Africa is especially gratified that the first use to which the Air Ministry&apos;s magnificent gift of 100 aeroplanes and equipment was put was the employment of one of these machines, christened the &quot; Voortrekker,&quot; a DH 9 with Siddeley-Puma engine, to carry through this extraordinary and most noteworthy enterprise. My Ministers are convinced that the knowledge and experience thus gained will be of the greatest practical benefit ancl of the utmost use to the development of long distance air communication over most difficult countries in all altitudes and climates. The Government of the Union of South Africa greatly regret that other attempts to complete the journey have so far not proved successful, and desire to express the greatest admiration of the pluck and enterprise of those who embarked on this very formidable venture.
