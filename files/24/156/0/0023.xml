/GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 31st July: Industrial Situation. The general industrial situation, in so far as actual disputes are concerned, is quiet. There is no change as regards the woollen and worsted industry and the road transport industry. The Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain received the reply of the Government to their demands on the 26th J uly, and have decided to call a National Delegate Conference to discuss the situation on the 12th August.Meetings have taken place in the course of the week between the Prime Minister and representatives of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and between some members of the Parliamentary Committee and representatives of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress. In view of the International Labour.and Socialist Conferences at Geneva next week, it does not appear that the Parliamentary Committee will be able to review the situation with regard to Ireland for some time. The tendency of opinion in the executive of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress would seem to be that they would prefer to, discuss with the Parliamentary Committee of the British Trades Union Congress the miners&apos; resolution passed at the special Trades Union Congress, rather than the railwaymen&apos;s resolution, especially in the form in which the latter was presented to the Prime Minister on the 22nd July.The expiry of the last extension of the out-of-work donation scheme at the end -of the present month and the situation which will then arise are under consideration.Unemployment Insurance Bill. The Bill received its second reading in the House of hords on the 23rd July, and was considered in Committee on the 27th.The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress met representatives of friendly societies on the 22nd July, but no solution of the difference between trade unions and friendly societies with regard to the Bill was reached. The Parliamentary Committee have expressed their willingness to consider a definite scheme for a demarcation and exchange of functions between the two sets of bodies, and a further meeting may take place. A deputation from the Parliamentary Committee met the Prime Minister on the 22nd July and presented and explained the resolution on the Unemployment Insurance Bill passed at the Special Trades Union Congress on the 13th July.The La,bour Party. A joint committee of the National Executive and the Parlia-mentary Labour Party has been appointed to consider the best methods of carrying on the work of the Advisory Committees of the Labour Party, so as to meet the needs . of Labour members of the House of Commons. Mr. G. D. H. Cole has resigned his position as secretary of these committees, and it has been decided to appoint in his place a full-time official, who will be one of the salaried staff of the Labour Party.Comparative Tables of Bread Purchase in Relation to Wages.The following tables, prepared in the Ministry of Labour, are intended to show bow Great Britain compares with certain continental countries as regards the quantity of bread purchasable with the daily wage at present current for adult workmen in certain typical occupations. The local variations to which both the rate of wage in a particular occupation-and the retail price of a particular article of food are subject in one and the same country at any given time have made it necessary, in order to ensure the utmost degree of international comparability, to consider for each country the wage rate and the bread price current in the capital only. Where, in the absence of information for the capital, it has been necessary to select some other town, the fact is duly indicated.In the case of foreign countries the wages, as well as the bread prices, are shown first in the foreign units of currency and weight and then in the corresponding English units. Conversions from foreign currency have been made in each case at the par of exchange, namely : -France, franc = 9&quot; 6cZ.; Italy, lira - 9&apos;6d. ; Norway, krone ^ 13&apos; 3d.; Sweden, krona ^ 13&quot;3d.
The wages shown are in all cases time rates fixed by the most recent agreement known to the Department to have been reached by collective bargaining between employers and workers in the trade.&apos;)     I.

COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Russian Ships at Port Said. Lord Allenby telegraphed as follows [No. 7831 on 30th July:-The Russian fleet auxiliaries Orel and Yakut arrived at Port Said on Sthand 15th July respectively, with cadets from Vladivostock, and -application has been&apos;made to-me by the representative of the late Russian Imperial Government here to allow the cadets to land in Egypt, so that the vessels may be released for purposes of trade in the Mediterranean with a view to earning the necessary funds for the continued maintenance of the cadets. It appears that it is by this means that the vessels have worked their way through from Vladivostock, and the crews are now subsisting on the proceeds of the trade they have carried on. The Captain of the Orel has made a similar application to the Senior Naval Officer, Port Said. The Captain may try to-take the cadets to Ragusa; but he refuses absolutely to take them to the Crimea on the ground that his sense of responsibility prevents him from involving the boys in. civil war again.In the meantime I cannot see my way to allow the crews to land at Port Said. For reasons which I have already explained, the presence of Russian refugees here is highly incorrect and is being increasingly adversely commented on. Both the Sultan and the Prime Minister reverted to the subject with me when I was at the races last Saturday, and said that the refugees were exercising a bad influence on the political situation in the country. They impressed upon me the importance of evacuating those here at the earliest possible moment, and I am in entire agreement with this-view. AVhile fully appreciating the difficulties of His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner at Constantinople, I imagine His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to put the interests of the refugees before that of peace and order here.   This is the issue.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xxii, p. 3]. On 24th July, the Viceroy transmitted [920 S.] Mr. Dobbs&apos; report, dated 22nd July, of the proceedings of the meeting held the previous day. Miscellaneous subjects had been dealt with, and the Afghans had requested a full authorized translation of the entire proceedings of the Conference. The Viceroy announced the intention to issue for publication in due course a summary of the results of the Conference.On 20th July the Viceroy transmitted a further telegram from Mr..Dobbs saying that the final meeting of the Conference had been held on 24th July. Mr. Dobbs had addressed the delegates, pointing out that the object of the Conference, i.e., the removal of misunderstandings and the preparation of a way for negotiating a treaty of friendship, had been fulfilled.Tarsi had replied that, as Afghanistan at present considered a firm friendship with Great Britain to be necessary and useful, and the friendship of Afghanistan was also considered advantageous by Great Britain, there were good hopes of a successful issue. After an interchange of compliments, Mr. Dobbs declared the Conference closed.   The Afghan delegates were to leave Mussoorie on 27th July.The Viceroi/s Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on the 24th and 30th July:-I. (24th July). The Dyer debate is still the main topic of interest. There is general dissatisfaction among Indians that the Commons did not insist on more drastic action than that proposed in the Government of India&apos;s and the Secretary of State&apos;s despatches. On the other hand, most English-owned papers have taken up DyeFs cause hotly and are issuing -subscription lists. Feeling has been further . exacerbated by Colonel Frank Johnson&apos;s speech at the European Association in Rangoon ; he maintained that Dyer, by killing hundreds, saved thousands, and referred to the condition of the loyal Punjabis as pitiful. He urged the European Associaticns in other provinces to appeal to the Government to stem the tide of crime, regardless of politicians here and at home. The United Provinces report that the Amritsar debate has deeply accentuated racial bitterness.
2. As regards the Caliphate agitation, the situation, generally speaking, is unchanged. Bengal report that the extremists are making attempts to persuade the pilgrims not to proceed to Mecca, but instead to subscribe money to the Caliphate fund and to.urge, the boycott of the Prince of Wales. In regard to the latter, there is no support from the Hindu extremists or the people generally. Mohamedans in general are genuinely - disturbed as to the safety of the sacred places, but there is little active feeling towards the Caliphate and no inclination to provide money or to accept non-co-operation.United Provinces report that the Caliphate movement is languishing. Interested persons are making money, and as this becomes known the response to financial appeals is poor. There are very few prominent maulvis on the side of the agitators, and hijrat does not win converts ; at the same time the political situation is deteriorating as racial bitterness increases.In the Punjab the situation is unchanged. Non-co-oj)eration makes but little progress. The mahajarins from the Punjab are few in number, but the emigration of 600 from. Sind has stirred the imagination. Speeches on the - Caliphate question continue to be intemperate, and efforts have been made to tamper with Mohamedan troops on leave. The propaganda was started in the villages by the Gujranwala Caliphate Committee. A noticeable feature of the political movement in.the Punjab is the increasing participation of the Sikhs in political extremism. The restrictions against the Independent of Allahabad and the Congress of Delhi in regard to entry into the province are now removed.   No paper is now excluded.In the Central Provinces the interest in the Caliphate question is distinctly on the wane. Shaukat Ali has written reproaching the Nagpur leaders for their luke-warmness. The leading maulvis refuse to join the non-co-operation movement. There are indications that the Hindu extremists are now advocating the boycott of British goods in preference to nou-co-operation as laid down by the Caliphate Committee.In Delhi people generally are apathetic towards the Caliphate and will not subscribe. There is a growing apprehension of the funds being used, by the promoters for their own personal advantage (corrupt group); army and police satis-factory. Non-co-operation is making no headway. The hijrat action, if any, is under the surface.In the Bombay province, since Ramazan, there has been some recrudescence of Caliphate activity in Sind; mischievous statements about the desecration of the Holy Places are being disseminated. Hijrat is more conspicuous here than elsewhere, but the actual departures are few compared with the numbers stated to be prepared to go. The railway authorities were asked for 1,500, but fewer than 700 actually went, many of them being ignorant yokels who sold their possessions to pay the expenses. It is expected that many will return. Non-co-operation is not flourishing. Three Mohamedans came forward to contest the vacancy caused by Bhurgi&apos;s resignation.The report of the general situation in the North-West Frontier Province is not so satisfactory, the hijrat movement having received appreciable impetus owing to mahajarins coming from Sind. We have now-arranged that no more special trains, shall be despatched, but there is considerable excitement in Peshawar over the Kacha Gari affray. Violent speeches were delivered at Lahore on the 19th, the speakers insisting on the &quot; brutality &quot; of British soldiers. We hope that the Chief Commis-sioner will be able to publish soon a full statement of the result of his enqtdry, but the military enquiry, of which the report lias been received, indicates that a British sergeant interfered originally without justification. The non-co-operation committee have decided to hold hartal on 1st August, in support of the non-co-operation move-ment. The Congress has not yet given a lead, and the special session will not be; held in Calcutta until September. As the Allahabad Leader points out, Congress followers must abstain from hartal, otherwise the non-co-operation committee super-sedes the Congress. The lawyer supporters of the movement are opposed to immediate non-co-operation and press for time till the courts are in recess. Gandhi and Shaukat Ali are now touring the Punjab, and are said to be visiting the North-West Frontier Province ; their proposals may give some impetus in Northern India to the non-co-operation movement as the imagination of the people has been stirred by the emigration of a large batch of mahajarins from Sind, and roused by the reports of the Kacha Gari affair.19-1      . T!
,The railway strike in Lahore is practically ended. Miller, and M. A. Khan are now despairing of maintaining the strike and declare that the only remedy is to leave the country; -. -A misleading:report of the reply given in the Commons to the question regarding Gandhi has caused considerable comment in the Indian Press, regarding what the Tribune calls the blank cheque to be given to the Indian authorities to deal with Gandhi as they like. We have published the correct version of the reply just received, as also of the questions and answers relating to the Hunter Committee, the despatches, and private evidence,II. (30th July). Very; great interest has been shown in the debate in the Lords. The general. Indian criticism.is that such a verdict was to be expected from a reactionary body like the House of Lords, and. much is made of the fact that speakers of note did not support: Dyer. Considerable satisfaction has been expressed at Lord Curzon&apos;s powerful and sympathetic speech which almost counteracts the effect of the vote. Lord Sinha&apos;s speech has been criticized as not vigorous enough. Subscription lists have been opened in India for Dyer and taken up energetically by the Ladies&apos; Committees of the European Associations and some English newspapers, but Pickford as sheriff for Calcutta has made an appeal to drop the Dyer controversy because of its effects on racial feeling. Be deplores the continuance of bitter wrath as it can do no good to either side. We have issued instructions to the Local Governments that No. 22 of the Government Servants Conduct Rules prevents them from subscribing to the Dyer fund. Surendra Math Banerjee has just issued a statement regretting the attitude of some European Associations and the Anglo-Indian Press in regard to the Dyer controversy, deploring the vote of the Lords on lord Finlay&apos;s motion and supporting the Secretary of State.Gandhi and Shaukat Ali have devoted the week to a tour in the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province, Sind, and Delhi before the hartal proclaimed for 1st August. Violent speeches wore made in the chief towns. The. Government of Bombay issued a note strongly deprecating the intemperate language used at the numerous public meetings held in recent months in Sincl in connexion, with the Caliphate agitation, and a grave decisive warning has been issued, to the effect that if the campaign of untruthful and inflammatory speeches ^should be persisted in, there would be no alternative but to apply to the whole province of Sincl, or such portions as may be necessary, the provisions of the Seditious Meetings Act. The ,Governor hopes that speakers on public platforms will recognize their responsibility for their statements and arguments and not compel the Government to take the steps indicated.The Seditious Meetings Act has been extended for a further period of three months to Delhi. As previously reported this met with the approval of the moderates, but protests have appeared in the extremist Press, and suggestions have been made to Gandhi to order the meeting to be held in defiance : GandhLs reply is not known, but Shaukat Ali is reported to have gone to Delhi.The Punjab Government issued a warning to intending mahajarins regarding the outbreak of cholera at Peshawar, and the extreme heat in Afghanistan, particularly in the desert areas. The Kacha Gari incident has greatly excited people in Peshawar, and an announcement has been made that the caravan of mahajarins will proceed on foot from Sind, and that the caravan under the lead of a guard (corrupt group) will also proceed on foot from Lahore.The hijrat movement is said to be gaining ground in the North-West Frontier Province, where some resignations have been reported among the police, and 30 out of 60 patwaris have resigned. These resignations may not be entirely influenced by religious motives, but it is reported that certain land-owning classes are selling up their land for a mere song to join in the hijrat. The situation in this province has markedly deteriorated as a result of the Kacha Gari affair, in which a British officer and a British soldier are held greatly to blame by the civil enquiring officer, the Deputy Commissioner at Peshawar., The. Chief Commissioner has recommended their prosecution in the Criminal. Court. We, have called for all papers and will communicate&apos; our decision later.Gandhi has declared hartal for Sunday, 1st August, to inaugurate non-co-operation^The following is an abstract ofa manifesto issued under the signatures of Gandhi, (? Abuz) Kalam Azad, Shaukat Ah, Ahmed Haji Siddick Khatri, Saifuddin Kitchlew,
Fazul Hassan Hasrat Moliani and Mohamed Ali. In spite of the efforts to secure a revision of the peace terms, it is certain, that there will be no revision before 1st August, and the Committee desires to mark the sacred (corrupt group) demonstra-tion of non-co-operation, and, to gauge public feeling, it seeks the co-operation of Hindus and other non-Moslem communities in making the inauguration a complete success, Therefore, (1) full hartal is advised on 1st August; but the mill hands are requested not to abstain from work without permission from their employers, and those required to carry on necessary daily work should also abstain; (2) the day should be devoted to prayer and fasting; (3) meetings should be heldall over the country including the smallest villages at which a resolution: of protest against the treaty and sympathy with the non-co-operation movement should be adopted in the prescribed terms, with or without speeches, and a copy sent to the Viceroy. The movement is said not to be one of civil disobedience. There are to be no processions ; speeches are to be restrained ; police instructions or regulations are to be obeyed ; and there is to be no meeting where there is a written prohibition. The success of the movement depends on perfect peace being observed by the community. Should unreasonable orders be issued interfering with the liberty of the subject, the question will be considered on its merits by the Committee. All title holders in sympathy with the movement are expected to surrender titles or honorary posts on this clay. It is impossible to predict how-far hartal will be successful, but feeling is certainly luke-warm except in Sine! and portions of the Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province ; and even there success of hartal will not necessarily indicate probable success of the non-co-operative movement. Malaviya in a recent speech urged the grave importance of the subject, and demanded that the country should take counsel together before deciding to follow the advice of Gandhi and the Central Caliphate Committee regarding non-co-operation from 1st August. The consequences of any decision are so serious and far-reaching that we are wrong to leave it to a few men, even though they had a venerated leader like Gandhi at the head of the movement. He earnestly advised waiting the decision of the Congress, and said he was going to request Gandhi and the Caliphate Committee to postpone action till the Congress had met. There.has been some difficulty in finding a president for this Congress, but Lajpat Pai is now declared to have been elected president of the special session. His election will undoubtedly give support to the non-co-operation movement. One or two resignations are reported: e.o/., Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, editor of the Hindu, resigned membership of the Prince of Wales&apos; Reception Committee as a protest against the attitude of the House of Lords in the Dyer debate, and against the remarks made on Gandhi by the Secretary and the Under Secretary of State. The non-Brahman conference at Hubli passed resolutions welcoming the Prince of Wales ; sympathizing with the Caliphate agitation; condemning the non-co-operation, movement; and regretting the House of. Lords&apos; Dyer debate as an exhibition of racial animosity. The report from Patna is to the effect that non-co-operation day is expected to pass almost unnoticed in Bihar, for except Mazaralhuq and Rajendra Prasad, no one has yet expressed sympathy.General pleasure has been expressed in the Indian Press at Sarma&apos;s appointment as Member of Council. Even Rajpat Rai, in a signed article in the Bande Mataram, congratulated him, and expressed a hope that the appointment would lead to the good of the country.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Miscellaneous. The Director of Information reports as follows : -1. It is understood that, as the result of the Canada-West Indian Conference, the preferential rate on a number of articles will be increased to 50 per cent. .2. Crop conditions, especially in the West, are very good. ;3. From arid after 1st August export of Canadian coal will be forbidden, save under special licence, to all countries except the United States and Newfoundland. 19-1 &apos;- C
AUSTRALIA.Islands in Japanese Occupation.-The following telegram from; the Governor-General . of Australia was received on 28th July:-My Ministers desire that.the Admiralty be asked whether Truk,&quot;and certain other islands in Japanese occupation, could be visited by one of His Majesty&apos;s cruisers of the China Station on a compli-mentaiy visit to the Japanese Admiral, with a view to ascertaining whether there is any substance in fact in the rumours which have reached here that the islands are being put to certain uses not in accordance with the mandate. The Commonwealth Government are anxious to clear up this matter. They suggest that it might be arranged for Japanese vessels to visit certain Australian ports in return.NEW ZEALAND.Butter.  On 22nd July the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Officer Administering the Government saying that it was understood that the negotia-tions had not yet resulted in agreement as to the disposal of the next seasons butter output, and that the Food Controller was anxious to arrange if possible for the purchase of the exportable surplus on terms similar to those agreed to in the case of Australia, 1st August 1920 to 31st March 1921, viz., 240s-. per cwt. f.o.b. for butter graded 90 points, with Ls. per cwt. additional for each point up to 95 inclusive, and Is. per cwt. less for each point under 90. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be grateful for the assistance of the New Zealand Government in inducing the New Zealand producers to negotiate on this basis. The price offered represented a substantial advance on the amount paid for last season&apos;s output.In reply to this the Officer Administering the Government telegraphed on 29th July saying that the Prime Minister had been in further consultation with the represen-tatives of the butter producers in an earnest endeavour to bring about a mutually satisfactory arrangement with His Majesty&apos;s Government. He found that the producers were-unanimous in reiterating their request for a free and uncontrolled market for their butter, and that they were of opinion that they should be given this in common with the home producers. These opinions were strongly and firmly expressed by their representatives, and, while having full regard to the position from the standpoint of tlis Majesty&apos;s Government, the Prime Minister, in view of the strong and unanimous feeling of the butter producers, felt that no other course was open to him than to support their representations.Wool [B.E.R., xx, p. 9]. On 22nd July the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Officer Administering the Government the following message from the Ministry of Munitions from his Prime Minister :-It is presumed to be acceptable to the New Zealand Government that 1,619,069Z. should be placed to their account at the Bank of New Zealand, London, and arrange-ments will be made accordingly. With the express approval of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Ministry of Munitions, the Australian wool growers are nominating a committee of three to represent their interests in London with a special view to conferring with the Ministry of Munitions as to the method of disposal of the remainder of the Governments stock of wool. The Australian wool growers consider themselves greatly interested in promoting such methods of sale as shall revive&quot; the confidence of the buying markets, move off wool in sufficient quantities, and at the same time as far as possible secure a remunerative price for existing stocks of wool and incoming clips. The Ministry of Munitions would welcome the appointment by the New, Zealand wool growers, with the approval of your Government, of one or two London representatives who would take part in the &apos; conferences on this important subject.Passport Difficulty in Western Samoa. On 23rd July the Officer Administering the Government reported to the Secretary of State that a difficulty had arisen in Western Samoa in connexion with the issue of passports to residents other than British subjects who desired to travel abroad. The Administrator of Samoa could issue piassports to British subjects, and presumably voider Article 127 of the Treaty of Peace to native inhabitants of Samoa, but he had no authority to issue them to any other persons. There were in Western Samoa many persons, particularly half-castes, who had really no nationality.   Many of the half-castes desired to acquire British nationality, but the
authority committed to the Government of. New Zealand to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Samoa apparently did not extend, to the naturalization of the inhabitants of the mandated territory as British subjects, because.the authority to make laws respecting British nationality was a delegated authority &quot;limited&apos; by the terms of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914. It was probable that the same&apos;question would arise in other German colonies held under mandate; and the Government of New Zealand desired to have the position put before the Imperial authorities with a request for directions as to cases in which passports could be. granted by the Administrator of Western Samoa to persons resident therein who were not British subjects.International Finance Conference.- The Officer Administering the Government reported on 29th July that his Government desired to nominate Sir James Allen as the representative of New Zealand at the International Financial Conference.
