RHODESIA.Southern Rhodesia&apos;s Defence Force.   Telegraphing from Salisbury on 30th October, Reuter&apos;s agent reported that the Government had decided to remodel the defence system of Southern Rhodesia. The first line of defence would be an adequate and well-trained police force, which would be organized as a mobile column in military districts. The present volunteers would be disbanded on 31st December, but musketry and cadet training would be retained on a voluntary basis.EGYPT.The Unrest.-Telegraphing on 29th October [No. 1519], Sir Milne Cheetham reported in regard to the rioting in Alexandria a few days before that entirely untrue reports concerning the behaviour of British troops had appeared in telegrams sent by the extremists to Europe and America, for propaganda purposes, as well as in the local papers. In fact, as appeared from the official reports, the troops had only fired under provocation. Telegraphing again on 8th November [No. 1557], reporting more rioting, he said that it was erroneous to suppose that a stoppage of business had been caused by the unrest. The strike of various sections of transport labourers had, however, considerably interfered with the movement of cotton, and there had been a serious but temporary interruption of transports in the preceding week. /Political agitation was strongly suspected. It was possible that the situation might recur, but no men were then out.ADEN.Colonel Jacob&apos;s Mission. On 27th October the Resident at Aden reported [no number] that he had received a very favourable reply to the letter he had sent to the Imam on 20th September. The latter said that he had told the Quhra that he had no wish to bring about any change in. customs but only to get the affairs of Yemen into a sound state. He added that if the release of the mission depended, on Mujgikjr, he should be.freed, at once; he, the Imam, had always been ready to let hini go on a guarantee that he would not interfere with the trade routes.Telegraphing again on the same day [No. 217 A.P.], the Resident reported that the Imam had been twice urged to refrain from military measures against the Quhra and had stated, that he wpuld act accordingly.PALESTINE.The Hostility to Zionism.  On 7th November Lord Curzon asked [No. 1216] Lord Allenby to let him have his views on the following declaration which had been drafted on that proposed by Colonel Meinertzhagen and went as far as the Government was prepared to go at present: The attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been called to the growth in Palestine of an attitude of hostility towards Zionism, which is partly to be ascribed to the deliberate fomenting of trouble between races and religions by irresponsible persons and to a belief that the settled policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and their Allies with regard to the establishment of a national home for the Jews in Palestine can be influenced by agitation, and partly to a genuine misconception, of the nature of the policy of the Allies in this respect and the consequences to be anticipated from its introduction.In these circumstances, as the Power at present responsible for the admini-stratiori of Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Government think it well, to state clearly that the

On 27th October the Resident at Aden reported [no number] that he had received a very favourable reply to the letter he had sent to the Imam on 20th September. The latter said that he had told the Quhra that he had ]io wish to bring about any change in customs but only to get the affairs of Yemen into a sound state. : He added that if the release of the mission depended on Mujaikjr, he should be freed at once; he, the Imam, had always been ready to let him go on a guarantee that he would not interfere with the trade routes.Telegraphing again on the same day [No. 217 A.P.], the Resident reported that the Imam had been twice urged to refrain from military measures against the Quhra and had stated, that he would act, accordingly.PALESTINE.The Hostility to Zionism.  On 7th November Lord Curzon asked [No. 1216] Lord Allenby to let him have his views on the following declaration which had been drafted on that proposed by Colonel Meinertzhagen and went as far as the Government was prepared to go at present: The attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been called to the growth in Palestine of an attitude of hostility towards Zionism, which is partly to be ascribed to the deliberate fomenting of trouble between races and religions by irresponsible persons and to a belief that the settled policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and their Allies with regard to the establishment of a national home for the Jews in Palestine can be influenced by agitation, and partly to a genuine misconception of the nature of the policy of the Allies in this respect and the consequences to be anticipated from its introduction.In these circumstances, as the Power at present responsible for the admini-stration of Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Government think it well, to state clearly that the
Balfour Declaration of 2nd November 1917 which has been endorsed by the Allied and Associated Governments and to which they adhere does not contemplate either  .   (a) any interference with   the  custody ,of the holy places of Christians and Mohammedans by the adherents of these religions or, more generally, any curtailment whatsoever of religious liberty, subject always to the main-tenance of public order and security ; or (b)&apos; the flooding of Palestine with Jewish immigrants.   As is recognized by the Zionists themselves, the&apos; foundation of a national home for the Jews must necessarily be ,a gradual process, and it is not anticipated that Jewish immigration will do more than keep pace with the general improvement in the prosperity of the country, which is to be expected from the introduction of the capital and technical skill at the disposal of the Zionists ; or(c) spoliation or eviction of the present landowners in Palestine or the grant ofprofitable concessions to individuals; or(d) the government of a majority by a minority.  Those who profess to apprehendthis consequence overlook the fact that the administration of Palestine will be controlled by a great Power or combination of Powers under a mandate.None can deny the present backward state of industry and agriculture in Palestine. It is in the co-operation of the Zionists with the future Mandatory Power that a remedy for this unhappy condition of affairs must be sought.INDIA.Economic Conditions. On 31st October the Viceroy reported as follows : The relief works in the Bankura District of Bengal, and the relief operations in the Jubbulpore District of the Central Provinces and the Belgaum District of Bombay Presidency lurve been closed.The conditions at Bhagalpore and Deoghar in Bihar and Orissa have much improved, and the general situation in Hyderabad is satisfactory. The numbers relieved were as follows: Bengal: gratuitous, 1,837. Bihar and Orissa: works, 1,270; gratuitous, 44,377. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 4,977 ; gratuitous, 10,842. Central India : works, 3,400; gratuitous, 600. Central Provinces : works, 4,901 ; gratuitous, 6,064. Bombay: gratuitous, .13,518. Hyderabad: works, 20,000; gratuitous, 23,000. Madras : works, 59,983 ; gratuitous (incomplete figures), 86,705.Norbh-West Frontier. On 6th November the Viceroy reported [No. 15081] that the Afridis had made a raid on Kohat city ; otherwise all was quiet north of the Kuram. It was, he said, reported that the Waziri malik at Kabul had sent messages telling them not to commit themselves further by hostile acts or raids, the Amir having concluded -peace with the British. He also reported that the Mahsud jirga were given our terms at Khirgi on 3rd November ; they had been informed that the Amir advised them to make peace with the British Government, their informant being Hayat Khan Mahsud, who had returned from Kabul.THE DOMINIONS.The League of Nations. The following message from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Prime Ministers of Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand was sent on 8th November : -The ratification by America of the Peace Treaty still hangs in the balance and the opponents of ratification are making great play with the argument that if a &quot; dispute likely to lead to a rupture &quot; between a Foreign Power and the United Kingdom, or
any one of the four Dominions, or India, were brought before the Assembly of the League under Article 15, all the other, five votes could, be cast in support of the part of the Empire immediately affected although the member representing1 it could not vote. This, is, in our opinion, a wrong interpretation. We hold that the represen-tatives of all pails of the Empire would be debarred from voting in this particular case,.i.e., a &apos;: dispute likely to lead to a rupture&quot; between a Foreign Power and any State of the Empire.Our Ambassador at Washington, Viscount Grey, is urging us most strongly to make a declaration, to this effect, which he believes would have a decisive influence on the American Senate&apos;s decision. But we have refused to sanction this course without the assent of the Dominion Governments, I should be.glad to know at the earliest possible date whether your Government would approve of such a declaration being-made. It would, of course, be made perfectly clear that the declaration referred only to the particular case &quot;just explained, which might arise under Article 15, and that in all other respects the rights of the United Kingdom and the Dominions and India as six original Members of the League were not affected1.It has, I ought to add, also been contended in the United States that the British Empire should not have more than one Member on the Council of League at the same time, but His Majesty&apos;s Government has refused definitely to accept any reservation which would prejudice the eligibility of a Dominion or of India to be -selected as one of the &quot;fcur other. Members, of the,League&quot; whose representatives are to sit on the CounciL The question was raised in Paris, and President Wilson, M. clemencoau ; and the Prime Minister gave a, written assurance that in their view&apos;representatives of the Dominions might be selected or named as Members of the Council, upon the true construction of the first two paragraphs of Article 1 of the Covenant.We are determined to adhere to this.CANADA.Representation: at Washixigtoni^EM. ii. 2].--The following telegram was sent to the. GovernoivGeneral of Canada by the. Secretary of State for the Colonies on 28th October:-&apos;The proposal of your Ministers has been most carefully considered by the Cabinet. We recognise fully that-the demand for the distinctive representation of Canada in His Majesty&apos;s! Embassy at &quot;Washington is justified by the importance of Canadian business at -Washington and the closeness of the relationship between the States and Canada. At the same time we cordially reciprocate your desire that such distinctive representation should take a form which would maintain and. emphasize the solidarity of the Empire.and provide well-balanced protection of Canadian and Imperial interests in the United States.We think it very desirable from, this point of view to secure the position of the representative of Canada as part of the establishment of the Embassy, and to preserve the closest connexion between him and the xAmbassador, so that there may be a, constant, interchange of views on matters of common concern.The most convenient and suitable method of carrying out this object would be, in our opinion, for the Government of Canada to recommend, and for His Majesty to appoint, a Minister. Plenipotentiary.who would be next in rank in. the Embassy to the Ambassador, and have charge of Canadian affairs and conduct them with the Govern--ment of the United States acting upon instructions from, and reporting direct to, the Government of Canada. He should take his place at the Embassy as Minister in charge, of Canadian affairs, and the Government of the United States should be formally apprised of his appointment by an. official letter from the Secretary of State accrediting the Canadian Minister and empowering him to conduct Canadian affairs with, the Government of the United States, direct. In the absence of the Ambassador, the Embassy would be in charge of the Canadian Minister. The solidarity of the Empire would in this way be maintained and emphasized, which could hardly lie the case;1 if the diplomatic -agent for the Dominion of Canada were accredited to the President of the United States independently.It would, be essential, in order to carry out this policy, that the Minister should reside, at, and, have his office within, the precincts of the Embassy, and that Mils Canadian staff, appointed like himself On the recommendation of the Governmental Canada, should have a diplomatic status and be regarded as part of the diplomatic
AUSTRALIA.Speech by the Prime Minister. In the course of his speech at. Bendigo on 30th Octo-ber, Mr. Hughes, according to a Renter telegram, stated that the Government recognized the need for a greater population, and would encourage immigration and land settle-men t in conjunction with the States, after the men now on the land and the returned soldiers had been comfortably settled and encouraged to remain there. Mr. Hughes summarized the good work done in the textile and mining industries. A. new tariff had been prepared, which would be submitted at the earliest moment possible after the meeting of the new Parliament. The Minister of Customs would be given special, power to prevent dumping, Steps would be taken to deal with the high cost of living, so as to protect both consumer and manufacturer. While producers, primary and secondary, would be encouraged to co-operate with the Government, no attempt at force would be used. To assist cotton-growing, a minimum price for three years would be guaranteed. Oil, the development of the Pacific Islands, trade and health matters, all were being carefully considered.Dealing with the war expenditure the Prime Minister said the expenditure out of revenue for the present year was estimated at 48,065,0001., an increase of 25,000,0001. Of this, only 500,000L represented an increase in ordinary expenditure. Since the outbreak of the war, the heavy war expenditure, amounting to 4,3,527,7631,, had necessitated a revision of direct taxation, which up to 30th June last had yielded a total of 44,342,9341. In order to harmonize the taxation of the Commonwealth and the States, the whole incidence of Commonwealth taxation would be remodelled.Shipping Requirements. The request of the Government of the Commonwealth for shipping of the stocks of frozen rabbits [B.E.R. hi] has been replied to by the Secretary of State for the Colonies [Tel. 6th November] to the effect that the plans for shipping Government stocks of rabbits some months ago had been upset by the demand on all available steamers to relieve the meat situation which had been caused by the drought. Large shipments of Government stocks&apos; had been and were now proceeding. Shipments on private account would be renewed at the earliest possible date, consistent with the clearance of Government stocks.International Labour Conference. A telegram dated 7th November has been received stating that the International Labour Conference desired the International Organizing Committee to be informed, that in consequence of the uncompromising refusal of the industrial organizations to take a part in the selection of workmen&apos;s delegates, the Government regretted to find that it was not in a position to participate in the Conference.NEW ZEALAND.Prorogation of Parliament. Telegraphing on 7th November the Governor-General announces that the New Zealand Parliament was prorogued on that date.staff of His.Majesty&apos;s Embassy, with rank equivalent to that of their British colleagues of porresponding grades   .... .We confidently hope that the above proposals will meet the views of the Dominion Government, Should, however, experience show the necessity for further modifications to meet the altered conditions and the new status of the Dominions, there will be an opportunity for full discussion of this subject at the contemplated conference to be held next year on the constitution of the Empire. Meanwhile, a beginning covdd at once be made by the establishment of a Canadian branch of the Embassy at Washington as above suggested.Austrian Peace Treaty. The Governor-General telegraphed on 7th November that at Ottawa on the Oth November an Order-in-Council had been approved whereby His Majesty the King would be humbly moved to approve, confirm and ratify, for and in respect of the Dominion of Canada, the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Austria which had been concluded and signed by Plenipotentiaire-tentiaries acting with due authority at St. Germain en Laye on .10th September 1919.
Nauru. On 29th October the Governor-General reported that the House of Representatives and. the Legislative Council had unanimously assented to the ratification of the agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion of New Zealand, relating to the administration of the island of Nauru and the mining of phosphate deposits thereon.SOUTH AFRICA.Speech by General Smuts on the Political Situation. Owing to the interesting political position, unusual attention is being paid to the proceedings at the Transvaal South African Party Congress, at which General Smuts made a vigorous speech on 30th October. The Premier, who received a cordial ovation, affirmed the success of the policy of the South African Party which stood for moderation and had emerged triumphant from all. difficulties and storms.Turning to the other party Congresses which have been held recently, General-Smuts declared that the Unionists had shown only a little South African spirit, and had laid overmuch stress on outside and Imperial interests. On the other hand, the Nationalists were patriotic, but so narrow-minded that they were unable to see the whole truth and had become increasingly a party of isolation. The motto of the Nationalists, like that of the Sinn Fein, was &quot;Ourselves alone.&quot; This was an impossible attitude. Regarding the great advantages of the British connexion, General Smuts asked the Nationalists to recognize facts. A few ships would soon abolish the trade of an isolated South Africa if it got into trouble with a European Power, and would paralyse the country. He was convinced that the real interests of South.Africa lay in being a member of the ^British Empire, the mightiest group of nations in the world, and one which gave all possible freedom to its members. The only plank left to the Nationalists was secession. If they worked for that they would have to fight and would once more reap the bitter fruits of the past.The Premier recalled his appeal in the House of Assembly to all citizens to make a new start. He believed that the rank and file of the Nationalists desired reunion, but their leaders would have none of it. They had killed General Botha and desired to kill him.Dealing with Sir Thomas Smartt&apos;s overture for amalgamation with the South African Party at the Unionist Congress at Bloemfontein, General Smuts said he was thankful that the Unionists were becoming increasingly imbued with the South African spirit, but Sir Thomas Smartt was afraid of absorption. It was not the intention of the South African Party to absorb : their object was hearty co-operation.. General Smuts appealed to the whole population, to the South African, Unionist,. Nationalist and Labour parties, to support the policy of the Government and to devote themselves to the great tasks of peace agricultural; mineral and industrial. The Premier said he must rely first on the South African Party which had stood by the-Government so faithfully hitherto.; but his appeal was to the whole population, and he hoped his appeal would not be in vain. It was most difficult to ask people to leave their party, and he did not do so ; but the Unionists and Nationalists should support the Government in making South Africa a really great country. The Union must devote itself to industrial development. Consequently he advocated a policy of co-operation, and if the people supported the Government, the next decade of their history would be unparalleled and would give them the status of a great country, strong internally and able to speak in the world with a force behind it equal to that of any other nation on the earth.
