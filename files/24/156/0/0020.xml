General Labour Situation. The following paragraphs are taken from the reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending 2nd and 9th June respectively : 1. (2nd June.) With regard to the attitude of the trade union movement towards Ireland, Poland and Hungary, the situation has been simplified during the week by the reference of these matters without exception to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress with requests for the summoning of a special congress to deal with the matters, and by the suspension of all further action.-2. (9th June.) With regard to the industrial situation, the strikes actually in progress are relatively unimportant, but a critical situation with regard to wages demands exists in several important industries. The position is most critical with regard to gas workers, but the position as to printers is taking a more hopeful turn. There is considerable discontent among agricultural labourers on account of the recent award of the Central Wages Board, which is being exploited in competition by the Workers&apos; Union and the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union, while conditions in the building trades are still unsettled. The Industrial Court will commence the periodical review of wages in the engineering trades on the 29th June. The annual^ conference of the N.U.R. will begin on 5th July, and of the M.F.G.B. on 6th July, and both these conferences will have to take important wages decisions.The opening of the International Labour Conference at Genoa to discuss seamen&apos;s conditions on the 15th June is perhaps one of the most significant events of the year.The most important question pending at the close of the week under review was the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. which decided to summon a special meeting of the Congress to determine the attitude of the trade union movement on the questions of Ireland, Russia and Hungary.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Wheat Situation. On 20th June Lord Allenby sent the following telegram [No. 605] :-The requirements of Egypt from May 1921 to May 1922, in relation to the culti-vation of cotton, have been receiving the careful consideration of competent authorities of the Egyptian Government.(1) Egypt has always had to supplement by importation its local supply of cereals : and the Egyptian Government has made arrangements whereby sufficient wheat and flour will be imported to meet the requirements of the country up to May 1921.(2) Those requirements have been obtained chiefly through the agency of the Royal Wheat Commission, London. It is not known, however, if that Commission will be disposed or will be in a position to undertake similar arrangements on behalf 6Pthe Eg^ypbian Government for the wheat year of 1921-22.s(3)-af the contrary is the case, it follows that the Egyptian Government either must make its own arrangements with wheat-producing countries for 1921-22; or,, alternatively, Egypt must grow more corn. That increase of growth can be obtained only by restricting the area under cotton.(4) It is estimated that from May 1921 to May 1922 some 300,000 tons of wheat and flour (more or less : an estimate only can be given at this moment) must be imported into Egypt to supplement the expected deficiency of local produce. Failing that importation, the area under cotton in 1921 must be reduced by a number of acres, correspondingly reducing the cotton produced, approximately, by 190,000 bales, equivalent to, approximately, 25 per cent, of last years estimated crop (namely, 750,000 bales).    .
(5) In view of the prevailing reports as to a world shortage of wheat, the Egyptian -Government is uncertain how far its efforts in any independent negotiations with wheat-producing centres may meet with success. If the cultivation of cotton is unrestricted, failure to achieve that success would be disastrous. Some guarantee must, therefore, be given that the desired quantity of wheat and flour (300,000 tons, more or less), 1921-22, is placed at the disposal of Egypt,(6) A mixed committee representing Egyptian interests has been formed to consider the question of the food supply. A sub-committee of that committee has now reported, and recommends that Egypt should largely increase the area under cereals. It is probable that this view will be accepted, with the result that the area under cotton will be much reduced.A definite guarantee by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the quantity of wheat and flour required, which is estimated now at 300,000 tons, more or less, for 1921-22, will be available, will probably influence the opinion of the general committee, and the decision of the Council of Ministers.Are you disposed to offer this guarantee for the season of 1921-22 ? Please reply urgently as I must know before the meeting of the committee on 1st July.Thz Prime Minister s Conditions [B.E.R., xix., p. 3]. On 10th June Lord Curzon informed [Ho. 527] Lord Allenby that he had no objection to the undertakings he had given on the assumption of office by the present Prime Minister, except those regarding the capitulations, the judicature Jaws, and possibly those relating to nationality. Lord Milner&apos;s Mission liad deliberately framed the scheme for the mixed tribunals, so that it might come into force without reference to the Legislative Assembly, and independently of any settlement of the political status of the country.PALESTINE.Message for the Emir Feisal. Telegraphing on 14th June [No. 534], Lord &apos;Curzon instructed Lord Allenby to make -the following communication to the Emir Feisal: The appointment of Mr. Samuel as High Commissioner for Palestine has been decided upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government because they are convinced that his high reputation and administrative experience render him peculiarly qualified for the task, and because his authority with the Zionists, coupled with his well-known sympathy for the Arabs, will enable him to hold the scales even, and to exercise a pacifying and moderating influence at the outset of the new system of civil administration. Mr. Samuel is about to make a public statement of the views and intentions with which he goes to Palestine, which will be telegraphed to you for transmission to the Emir Feisal, whom it should fully reassure. Mr. Samuel will seek an early opportunity after his arrival in the country of communicating with the Emir with a view to removing any remaining sources of misunderstanding. . We believe that the Emir and the Arabs will find in him a sincere friend.Land Registration and Railways. On 17th June Lord Allenby telegraphed &apos;[No. 4, V.V.M.] to the War Office, saying : (1) No practical difficulties exist in the preparations for opening land registries about the middle of July on the lines already proposed ; and (2) it would be far preferable to hand over the Palestine railways to the Civil Administration at a later date after Sir Herbert Samuehs arrival, possibly the -end of July, as a large number of questions must first be settled which need his -decision.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xix., p. 4]. The official conversations between the British and Afghan delegates were resumed at Mussoorie on 7th June after a suspension of more than a month. On 8th June the Viceroy transmitted [709 S.] a report&apos; from Mr. Dobbs of what had happened on the reopening of the conference. Mr. Dobbs said that he had started proceedings by the recital of a summary of British policy towards Afghanistan, with a full and frank commentary on the Afghan pretensions as understood by us.   The Afghans were invited to say if they really
&quot;believed that the British Empire, the most powerful empire in the world, would be-likely to accept such demands as those put forward by the Afghans, and they were-warned of the inevitable result of continued unfriendliness, while the great advantages of friendship with us were depicted to them. The ensuing discussion was. confined to the detailed elucidation of our points of grievance regarding Afghan encouragement of tribal disturbances on our frontier, Indian revolutionaries and Bolsheviks. Tarsi asked for three or four days to consider his reply, and before the sitting closed assured Mr. Dobbs that his views had undergone a considerable; change, and that he had come to the conclusion that the friendship of Great Britain was necessary for Afghanistan.Consequent on the compliance with Tarsi&apos;s request, it was not until 12th June that the Viceroy was able to transmit [730 S.] a telegram from Mr. Dobbs giving further information. In this Mr. Dobbs stated that Tarsi had sent him a note full of: the usual perverse arguments, but privately admitting that the attitude assumed by the delegates at the conference was intended for home consumption, but really they were sincerely friendly and wished to be conciliatory. The note repeated the denials and explanations of various actions on the frontier, and intimated that without help-from us in the supply of money ancl arms Afghanistan had not sufficient strength to stand up against Russian intrigues among the tribes on our frontier. The note concluded as follows : &quot;Afghanistan, is ready to assure your Government of its acceptance, in conformity with its rights of freedom, of the demand mentioned by you, but this--we do conditional upon the fulfilment of your promise; You wish to help us to-become free, strong, and prosperous. The real essence of the question lies here. If you will favour me with full details in this respect we shall have nearly reached the-final settlement.&quot;Mr. Dobbs considered that this note would entail a certain amount of plain-speaking, ancl attributes its tone to a message to Tarsi from Nadir Khan, reproaching&quot; the former for evincing too much complacency. Tarsi was reported to have informed) his entourage that should he be employed on any future diplomatic mission to India, he-would insist on being accompanied by the Amir, as anyone coming alone, and trying, to come to a reasonable agreement, was likely to be immediately replaced at Kabul.According to Mr. Dobbs&apos; report, transmitted [732 S.] by the Viceroy on 13th. June, a four hours&apos; conference had, been held the previous day. In the first part of this Mr, Dobbs&apos;had combated and repudiated the Afghan charge of breach of faith, in our re-occupation of Lambabat. Next, the Turkish peace terms were discussed.. The Afghans contended that the holy places of the Hejaz were not left under-independent Moslem control, that King Hussein would not be self-supporting and capable of maintaining dignity in the holy places when they were deprived of&quot; connexion with the powerful Caliph, and that in the eyes of the Afghan the value of the pilgrimage would be lost. Mr. Dobbs endeavoured to meet these arguments, but it looked as if the long and rambling discussion, which ensued on the question of the terms of the Turkish peace, would take up several days.On 15th June the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy that the receipt of this report Was causing him some anxiety.   &quot;While he realized that, in the absence-of a definite agenda paper, it was difficult to exclude the discussion of the Turkish treaty, and recognized the political importance of having the Amir on our side as-against the Indian Moslem extremists, it was necessary for Mr. Dobbs to hold to the fundamental position that as Afghanistan had chosen to remain neutral during the war, she had no focus standi as between the Allies and Turkey.&apos; However much the--Government of India might sympathize with Moslems in their religious difficulties,, the terms of the Turkish peace could not be allowed to be made a factor in. determinating our relations with Afghanistan.The Viceroy transmitted [739 S.] on 15th June a further telegram from Mr. Dobb3,. announcing that the discussion on the Turkish peace terms had concluded on the 14th. He reported the attitude of the Afghan delegates as being extraordinarily reasonable ancl subdued. In answer to their enquiry as to whether in deference to Afghan, feelings any modification of the terms might be looked for, Mr. Dobbs informed them that there could be none. The Afghans then suggested that the Afghan delegation, should visit Paris to make their representations there. To this Mr. Dobbs replied that Afghanistan as a non-belligerent had no locus standi for such a purpose, and further that, subject to such minor alterations as the Allies might be induced to make-on Turkish representations, the terms were finally settled, and the delegation would.
be useless, The principal Afghan suggestion was that the maintenance of the nominal suzerainty of Turkey over Arab and other nationalises, which under the terms were to be made independent, would go a long way to satisfy the sentiments of Afghan and other Moslems. &apos; F &quot;,The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Beports-The-A7iceroy&apos;s weekly reports for .4th and 11th -June -were as follows :-I. (4th June.) With the exceptional the Times of India, all the English-owned papers consider that General Dyer saved the situation, and has been unjustly condemned, while all the Indian-owned papers, both extremist and moderate, are united in accepting the minority report, This is, no doubt, in part due to the exigencies of the electioneering campaign, in order that the moderates may not expose themselves to any attack by the extremists through a difference of opinion on this subject. The United Provinces note that the report has greatly exacerbated racial feeling, but we hope this is only a temporary phase, as influential papers like the Pioneer, the Civil and Military-Gazette, and the Statesman are urging the necessity of forgetting the past, obliterating racial bitterness, and reaching- forward to the future, and we hope that moderate Indian papers will soon follow suit.We mentioned that the Congress Committee which sat at Benares had decided to call a special session of the Natioual Congress at Calcutta to consider the Punjab affairs, the Caliphate, and the reforms rules. It is nowr announced that the session will be held on 12th August. If this date is adhered to, the delay is significant, as the interest in the-two former subjects is likely to have diminished largely by then. The Committee of the India Association at Calcutta has passed resolutions approving the minority, and urging the censure of Sir Michael OTJwyer, the dismissal of General Dyer, and the punishment of those who abused their powers in administrating martial law.2. A conference of politicians of all schools from the provinces has been called -at Allahabad for 1st and 2nd June, to decide future policy in regard to the Caliphate and the Turkish peace terms: Ulema from all parts of India have been invited by Abdul Bari to be present. The promoters endeavoured to secure the attendance of Hindus of all parties, and the moderate leaders have been approached personally and by circular; it is, however, believed that only some extremist Hindus, whom the Mussulmans least want, have responded. A Press report has just been received that the Caliphate Conference sat till late on night of 1st June, the discussion lasting till the small hours of the. morning when the sitting was adjourned. The Press was rigorously excluded, but it is understood that there was great difference of opinion as to whether non-co-operation should be adopted and in what way; that some spirited and angry speeches were delivered; and that no decision was arrived at.3. Meanwhile the agitation proceeds on the lines indicated in previous weekly telegrams, i.e. : (1) Few outward signs of violence and fewer meetings. (2) Con-tinuance of virulent articles in extremist Press. (3) Some attempts to tamper with the loyalty of the army and the police. (4) Spasmodic resignations, e.g., Chotani has now resigned his honorary magistracy. (5) The view is gaining ground among the moderates that non-co-operation is unworkable; the extremists are beginning to favour a more effective line, of action. For example, Abul Kalam Azad. at a recent private gathering expressed the view that non-co-operation would not be successful and objected to hijrat; he held that Moslems should reorganize themselves by electing an Imam whose orders they should obey, regardless of consequences. On the other hand, Abdul Bari and his clique declared that non-co-operation should at once be brought into effect; but.be has, in private letters, adopted a very different line. (6) In questions of hijrat--but little activity. For example, the Sind hijrat committee wired to the Governor of Bombay :-&quot; 25,000 Moslems ready for hijrat to Afghanistan on account of interference in religion. If any formality, please wire.&quot; Similarly in the Punjab, the names of Mohamedans prepared to go to Afghanistan continue to be registered, but only very few so far have left the province for Kabul. The prospect is not attractive ; there is to be no return from emigration and no financial help can be given to those wishing to emigrate.4- The following is the summary of a report from the North-West Frontier Province on the hijrat movement and the policy adopted by the Government in that Province. A hijrat committee was formed at Peshawar; the local Khans, however, made the promoter understand that he was not welcome, and he left Peshawar, leaving .a colleague to. carry on work. A total of 25 emigrants is reported to have arrivecl,-17-4   &apos; . B
mostly low-class Mohamedans. A later party of 16&quot; emigrants with six children (? left) for Afghanistan under the leadership of Abdul&quot; Wahab, who subsequently returned to Peshawar. The issue of passes to emigrants was referred to Kabul by the Trade Agent at Peshawar, who received a firman from the Amir saying that instructions had already been sent to the secretary of the hijrat committee through Sardar Ghulam Mohamecl Khan, the Afghanistan envoy; that the procedure laid down must be strictly followed ; and that no passes should be issued by the Trade Agent, as were he to do so he would lay the Government in Kabul open to the charge of causing unrest in India and also place the Amir in a difficult position should the Government prevent emigrants in possession of passes from crossing the frontier. Others proceeding by routes other than Kabul without the assistance of the Political Agent at the Khyber, who reports that about 40 have arrived at Jalalabad. The Chief Commissioner has. adopted the policy of non-interference with persons desirous of emigrating to Afghanistan or tribal territory.5. From Bombay it is reported that the Viceroy&apos;s message and the explanatory statement of the Government of India on the Turkish peace terms have not yet been well received, ancl the extreme Hindu Press is making capital out of a fancied disregard for the sentiments of Indian Moslems. There is, however, reliable information that the Hindu leaders will strongly oppose the non-co-operative programme at the joint meeting at Allahabad. A suggestion has been made by Yakub Hasan of Madras to a Bombay correspondent in an intercepted letter, that the peace terms should remain the principal plank in the coming elections, and that elected members should refuse to take the oath of allegiance at the first meeting of the new Imperial Council to be opened by the Prince of AVales. The Bombay Government have decided to consider the prosecution of . two individuals who delivered violent speeches at the recent conference at Jacobabad, which the law officers consider come within the Indian Penal Code.6. The Punjab report shows that the announcement of the peace terms has not caused any widespread excitement. While educated Mohamedans feel disappointed, the significance of the terms has not yet filtered down to the masses, and local agitators are waiting for a lead from Delhi or Bombay. Meanwhile the Caliphate propaganda is being carried on vigorously. Attempts to interest the peasantry, from which the Indian Army is recruited, are being openly made. It is significant to note that on the return of the 59th Sind Rifles to Jullundur, after nearly six years absence in France and other theatres of war, the Mohamedans ancl the Hindu population did not join in the reception at the railway station. The tone of the Press continues to be bad. The Viceroy&apos;s advice to Mohamedans is ridiculed. It is-admitted, however, that the Government of India ancl the Secretary of State have done their utmost to represent Moslem sentiments. The Hindu newspapers advise Mohamedans to do nothing hasty, ancl not to transgress the bounds of constitutional agitation. The Tribune has plainly told them that Hindus cannot stand by in the event of their renouncing loyalty to the Government.7. In the United Provinces the Turkish peace terms were received quietly. Sir H. Butler - is making a tour through the province partly to show sympathy with the Mohamedans in their recognized difficulties, and partly to maintain personal touch with the men who carry weight in the last resort. At first, great bitterness was exhibited by the Mohamedans, especially the Sunnis, but there is a growing disposition to accept facts, dissatisfaction being chiefly in evidence in the towns. There. is no enthusiasm anywhere to cany out the non-co-operative programme, but the difficulty of the situation is accentuated by the publication of the Hunter Report.A report is to hand from Sitapur, United Provinces, of a resigned infantry sepoy,, who at a ..meeting boasted that he had persuaded 50 other sepoys to resign with the object of taking up propaganda work in connexion with the Caliphate. We have also reason to believe that personal propaganda upon soldiers travelling by train has been started.8. A Bihar OLD. report just received states that no deep feeling has been excited by the Turkish peace terms in the minds of Mohamedans of any class in the province,, and what agitation exists is being kept up for purely political ends.9. A Press report from Hyderabad states that the Nizam has issued a firman with regard to certain persons who attempted to create disturbances in connexion with the Caliphate question, and sent disloyal telegrams to him.   Investigation has-- brought to light endeavours to create unrest in the State.   Cases of British subjects who are practising as barristers in Hyderabad  and are associated with lawless
individuals are under consideration. The Nizam has ordered the internment of five men and the extemment of five others,10. The railway strike at Lahore has extended partially, or completely, to Rawalpindi, Ludhiana, Ferozepore, Amritsar, Gujranwala and Wazirabad, and is now as much political as economic. A subscription for the strike fund is being collected by the extremist agitators to encourage the strikers to remain firm until the Govern-ment is defeated- On the other hand, the strike is becoming unpopular with the general public, who are beginning to resent the loss and inconvenience caused, and illogically blame the Government for the continuance of the strike. Efforts made in Amritsar to induce private servants to strike for higher wages proved abortive, but there is an indication that the irrecoucileables are attempting to make as much mischief as possible. The workmen of Ferozepore Arsenal are holding meetings, and contemplate striking for better wages and conditions. Practically all the employees of the central canal workshop at Amritsar have gone on strike, and the workshops-have closed. Miller has arrived at Campbellpur and is expected to take out the staff. -He is suspected to be not very willing to return to Lahore, as his following&apos;is feeling the pinch and becoming discontented. The strikers are now beginning to realize that the terms offered by the railway have satisfied their original demands, and that at present they&apos; are being kept out at great personal inconvenience, merely for the honour and glory of Miller and his associates.Information has been received that the men of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway workshops at Parel and. Matunga were resuming work on 31st May, after the receipt of satisfactory assurances of the agent that they would be granted 20 per cent, increase with effect from the 1st September.Five hundred men of the railway carriage and wagon workshops at Karachi are reported by the Press to have struck work this morning, bringing the total number of railway strikers at Karachi up to 2,000.A Press report has also been received of the strike of 400 workmen of the Madras Engineering Works.11. Candidates for election, to the new councils are coming forward in increasing numbers, and the work of canvassing has commenced in real earnest. The extremists and moderates wdio talked of non-co-operation are canvassing for tkem-selves, or promoting their friends&apos; candidature, as if they had never spoken of non-co-operation, and had never condemned the Reforms Act. The Mohamedans&apos; determination to take full advantage of it has not been affected, and they are as eager to be elected as Hindus, and are hard at work canvassing.II. (11th June.) The Hunter Report is still a main topic of discussion in the Press, and the extremist left (fndian) and right (European) are turning it into a definitely racial question centring in General Dyer. The extremists are striving hard to set on foot a bitter agitation on the subject, while the moderates, many of whom would probably at heart prefer to keep quiet, and privately consider that the Government of India have gone as far as could be expected, dare not, for electioneering reasons, abstain from following the extremist lead. The violent utterances of certain sections of the English Press and bodies like the European Association and the Bihar Planters, render it difficult for the Indian moderates to remain moderate, and Sastri has just published a very bitter article in the Servant of India denouncing the Governments treatment of the Punjab infamy, but expressing no surprise as the action taken accords with British practice -in the treatment of the coloured races, and urging criminal proceedings, not because of any hope of success, but on account of the moral effect of putting up a fight. The conclusion of the British Cabinet is described as lame and impotent.2. Further reports on the reception of the Turkish peace terms indicate an attitude of general acquiescence in many parts of India. In the Madras province they have been received with a calmness amounting to indifference in the Mofussil districts, whilst in Madras itself there was more outspokenness, but Mr. Yakub Hassan&apos;s example, reported last week, has not been followed; and though there are some fire-brands among the younger Mohamedans, there is not likely to be any widespread excitement, so long as there is no interference from outside agitators. In Bombay a meeting of 2,000 Mohamedans with Shaukat Ali in the chair, was held shortly after the announcement, but only six members of the Central Caliphate Committee were present, Chotani being absent. A few Hindus were there, but no followers of Tilak.   Fiery speeches were delivered, Rs. 400 collected, and two
sresolutions passed: (1) declaring support for the entire scheme of non-co-operation, and (2) sympathizing with the two men prosecuted under the Code of Criminal Procedure at Allahabad, who preferred to go to jail as previously reported. Dis-cussion of the actual terms was conspicuous by its absence, and no excitement has; been caused by them. . One Moslem paper made colourless comments, while others, counselled obedience and loyalty. It is noteworthy that at.the recent Bombay meeting of the Caliphate Committee it was resolved to take up only two stages of the non-co-operation plan, the second two being reserved for future consideration. In Bengal, the announcement occasioned no surprise, and though there is general disapproval,; the situation is unchanged. The feelings of the general mass of Mohamedans remain untouched, while the extremists for the most part are afraid of the lengths to which violent speeches have already run, and have decided to hold no public meetings for fear of rousing passions resulting in violence. Some attempt, has, however, been made to controvert our explanatory memorandum, and the,Viceroy&apos;s message has not been well received. An unsuccessful attempt was made to get members of the Seamen&apos;s Union to strike as a protest. In Bihar and Orissa, the terms have been quietly received with no display of excitement; this was due to the fact that they contained no element of surprise, and that a feeling of uneasiness is growing among the educated Mohamedans at the way the question has been exploited for political purposes. In the Central Provinces and Assam, the reception has been quiet and no local trouble is expected unless a stimulus be applied from.the outside. From Delhi, it is reported that&apos;things are quiet and there is reason to believe that this is more than a lull. Public opinion is much divided, sensible people thinking matters were going too far. No further developments are reported from the Punjab. The information from the United Provinces is that the Caliphate movement is losing strength, and that there are dissensions between Hindus and Mohamedans, especially as regards Afghan assistance; on the other hand, the resentment against the peace terms is growing and the agitation drifting into the hands of the Maulvis who require careful watching. The general unrest, the believed progress of Bolshevism, and the Irish disorders, are materially increasing the difficulty of the situation.3. The most important event of the week has been the conference at Allahabad, held on.the 1st and 2nd June, at which the policy in regard .to the main features of the Caliphate agitation was to be decided. Many delegates, even from Madras and Bengal, attended, and several Hindu leaders were present. On the first night 300 delegates attended a meeting at which the general feeling was that non-co-opera-tion should be adopted, but the view was also held that, while Moslems deserved sympathy, non-co-operation would-not be successful, Mrs. Besant, Tej Bahadur Sapru, and Chintamani opposing it. At the next day&apos;s meeting Moslems from various provinces explained how far they were ready to take up non-co-operation, and in the evening-formal resolutions were passed by the All-India Central Caliphate Committee, 30 members only being allowed to vote, though the delegates and visitors attending were&apos;150.   The following is a summary of the resolutions passed : (i) The movement of non-co-operation in four stages is reaffirmed and a sub-committee be appointed to give practical effect to the movement without further delay: the principal members being Gandhi, Abul Kalam Azad, Mohamed Ali, Shaukat Ah, Kitchlew, Hazrat Mohani. (The first stage will be put into operation after a month&apos;s notice to the Viceroy, who will first be approached with a view to the revision of the Turkish peace terms.)(ii) A protest against the Turkish peace terms and the expression of an unequivocal refusal to accept them.(iii) The firman of the Nizam of: Hyderabad, opposed the Shariat and deserved reconsideration.(iv) The Swadeshi movement should be undertaken in. real earnest, and a sub-committee appointed to work out a scheme for carrying it out.(v) Recorded a sense of obligation to Lala Amir Chand of Peshawar, and Maulana Fakir Hamid Ahmed of Allahabad for their sufferings in the Caliphate cause.(vi) Caliphate supporters should wear badge bearing the device &quot; We are helpers of God.&quot;(vii) A Caliphate Volunteer Corps to be organized with branches all over India to collect subscriptions for the Caliphate fund and prepare the Indian public for the non-co-operation movement.At the meeting Shaukat Ali made no secret of his bitter hatred of the British. 4. It is too early to predict how the resolutions will be accepted in the provinces, but the view is gaining ground that the Caliphate agitation is losing strength. Previous
to the meeting the attitude of the provincial committees was one of-&quot; wait ancl see,&quot; but indications are not wanting that little disposition exists to adopt non-co-operation as a practical measure, as the following facts show : (a) The doctrine of non-co-operation is being watered down and as now developed emphasizes moral force, the movement being neither anti-English nor &apos; anti-Government. Private employees, therefore, should not be touched, ancl pressure should not be brought to bear on Government servants. Voluntary withdrawals should only be countenanced by such persons as can support themselves and their dependents, or by those whose support is guaranteed by the Caliphate Committee. The more extreme Mohamedan leaders are of course impatient ancl not satisfied with this, and some of them are said to regard bloodshed as inevitable if the non-co-operation move-ment fails after a trial of, say, six months, but saner men are against precipitate action unless an opportunity be given by indiscretions on the part of Government officials.(/;) Gandhi and Shaukat Ali, when urging the people of Ahmedabad to be more zealous in the Caliphate movement, were told.that the Hindus would step in ancl accept all posts vacated by Mohamedans.(c) In&apos; Sincl the situation is easier; really respectable and influential zamindars, having detached themselves from the Caliphate campaign, are now actively co-operating with the district magistrate against it. The agitation has taken the form of stirring up discontent among the labourers against the zamindars and finds its main support in local bad characters. The Government of Bombay is sanctioning the prosecution of two men who made violent speeches at the Jacobabad conference. The pension of one retired Government official who presided at a non-co-operation movement has been suspended for six months, and one police sub-inspector, who gave two months&apos; notice of resignation as a protest, is now wholly ashamed and admits that he was momentarily carried away.id) The Nagpur Moslem leaders informed the Central Caliphate Committee that they were not prepared to accept the full progressive programme of non-co-operation, and have warned the Committee not to despatch emissaries on a preaching crus&apos;ade to the Central Provinces. They have announced that if any attempt is made to force the non-co-operation campaign upon them they will demand a guarantee of five lakhs for the relief of sufferers.5. Similarly with the hijrat, Shaukat Ali is said to favour it after a six months&apos; trial of non-co-operation, with a view to an ultimate attack on India from Afghanistan. Dissatisfaction with the poorer type of emigrant is already being expressed by the Eastern Unity paper of Afghanistan, which does not want useless men.6. At the same time the fanatics are in no way relaxing efforts, especially in regard to troops, e.g., a Maulvi addressing troops of the 20th Infantry in a mosque at Friday prayers urged that Moslems should in&apos;future resolve to abstain from fighting against other Moslems, and is said to have reduced his audience of officers and men to tears. An intercepted letter from Daud Ghuznavi Amritsar to Shaukat Ali urges the appointment of paid preachers ancl propagandists to be employed, particularly in those districts of the Punjab which.played a prominent part in recruiting during the war, in spreading the Caliphate movement, ancl in undermining the loyalty of the Army by getting at all ranks in this way Avhen on. leave. Peviewing the situation as a whole, we doubt whether the non-co-operation movement will succeed, but there are elements of danger in it and Gandhi&apos;s influence is a very powerful factor with many. The situation is not free from anxiety, and requires constant vigilance.7. There is great election activity. Moslem extremists will probably make the Caliphate question the main plank, but extremist Hindus on the whole, especially Tilak, show a disposition to fear that connexion with the Caliphate movement may prejudice their chances of capturing the new councils.

On 12th June the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand : The Government of Germany have drawn attention to the provisions of Article 306, para. 4, of the Treaty of Peace with regard to the payment of sums accrued where rights are withheld in virtue of special war measures. Apparently such sums must be claimed through the clearing office, but in many cases the persons concerned will not be able to claim as they will not know what measures were taken or the amount which they could claim. Accordingly the Government of Germany suggest that the Governments concerned should undertake to communicate to each other as soon as possible exact lists of the rights in question and the sums accumulated, and still accumulating, to be dealt with under the paragraph mentioned. The proposed lists should show (1) the owner, the object, official designation of the patent, copyright, &amp;c,&quot; and the registry number ; (2) the indication of the war measure, viz., the date, nature of issuing authority, ami particulars of beneficiaries; (3) particulars of payments cxaclod from beneficiaries; (4) amount of payments already made, in arrears, and payable in future; (5) the designation and address of the individual or department whose duty it is to make the payment to the owner.As regards the United Kingdom His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to comply with .the request, but will not guarantee that information supplied as to the ownership of any particular patent, &amp;o, is correct. Are your Ministers willing to make a similar arrangement ?CANADA.Export of Meat Products from the United Kingdoni.-In reply to a telegram of 7th June, on the subject of export of meat and meat products from the United Kingdom to Canada, the Governor-General telegraphed on 21st June as follows:   My Ministers represent that this matter has received the careful consideration of the Department of Agriculture, and although the system of inspection for meat and meat products in the United Kingdom does not fulfil the requirements and regulations in operation in this country, inasmuch as the importation of meat products from the United Kingdom to the United States is permitted under the system of certification indicated in the memoranda included in your despatch of 23rd February, No. 117, the Department of Agriculture is prepared to agree to accept the certification issue under the same conditions as for this country, only understanding, however, that this is purely a temporary measure, and until arrangements more in accordance with the meat inspection regulations of this country can be made by the Imperial authorities.Miscellaneous. The Director of Information reports as follows :-1. Business conditions throughout Canada are generally satisfactory. Bank dealings for the first week of June were 24 per cent, in excess of those for the corresponding period last year.2. Crop conditions all over Western Canada continue very favourable.3. The Minister of Customs has given notice in Parliament of legislation which will authorize the licensing of exports of goods which are necessary or desirable for the use or consumption of the people of Canada. While newsprint paper is not included, it is understood that the legislation is designed to meet the requirements of
NEW ZEALAND.Meat. The following telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand was received by the Secretary of State on 9th June : Having regard to the position as set out in the late communication from the Prime Minister [B.E.R., xix., p. 10], and the further representations which the High Commissioner is making regarding those producers who, owing to delayed shipxhng and congestion of storage, have the prospect before, them of being unable to freeze their stock before 30th June, the decision conveyed in your cipher telegram of 26th May [ibid, p. 11] was received with great regret. These present representations from the High Commissioner are earnestly commended to the favourable consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government. A disquieting development of the position lies in.the quick action on the part of American meat companies, in particular Armour &amp;. Co., in endeavouring to secure a trade footing in the Dominion. There exists legislation which confers upon my Ministers ample powers to prevent this. These powers are being exercised, but having regard to the great financial resources and widespread influences of these American meat companies my Ministers can but realize that in enabling the Dominion effectively to maintain its (? trade) position, especially as regards a reliable market in the United Kingdom for its frozen meat in the immediate future, the active support of His Majesty&apos;s Government is a most necessary factor. It is realized that as a matter of expediency the shipping to America of a.portion of the meat stocks at present stored in the Dominion provides a useful method of meeting the immediate position, and, further, that later some measure of trade in meat with America, if at any time any surplus above British requirements exists, may be of business value : but my Ministers feel that it would be greatly preferable under open trading conditions to possess a reliable market in the home country for the bulk of the Dominions meat.Having regard to the proved malpractices of the American companies, lately made known by the reports of the Commission set up by the Government of the United States and by the methods adopted in recent years by these companies in the Argentine, my Prime Minister is of the opinion that an immediate necessity exists for combating strongly their present activities in New Zealand ; and that in order to do this effectively the co-operation - of His Majesty&apos;s Government is necessary in every way, particularly as regards the early provision of the best facilities possible under the forthcoming conditions for a good market in the United Kingdom for New Zealand meat, which will not be adversely influenced by American operations and which will provide New Zealand producers with as reasonable a return, for their output as existing circumstances permit. My Ministers are impressed by the fact that a tendency is being evinced by banks and large mercantile companies to support the incoming of American companies, and, while having full regard to the current position in respect of finance, they realize that serious disabilities may arise in the near future unless a strong and effective stand be adopted now.SOUTH AFRICA.Claims against Germany. On 17th June the Governor-General of South Africa telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State : My Ministers anticipate that the claim to be presented by the Government of the Union of South Africa to the Reparation Commission will be in the neighbourhood of 7,000,000J. in respect of the following items :-(a) Debts incurred by the Government of Germany and clue to Union nationals ; (b) claim for goods which at the outbreak of war were in. transit in enemy vessels ; (o) claim for loss of life and personal effects ; (d) claim in respect of property, money invested in Germany, &amp;c, confiscated by the Government of Germany ; (e) claim for damages for wrongful arrest, internment, 17-4 D-Canadian publishers by-providing for the refusal of export licenses unless the needs of the publishers are first met.4. The Honourable C. 0. Baliantyne, M.P., Minister of Marine, announces that the Dominion Government has accepted from the Imperial authorities one cruiser, two destroyers, and two submarines, and that additional naval estimates amounting to 2,200,000 dollars will be submitted. There will be no decision on the subject ;ol the permanent naval policy until after the Imperial Conference next year.
&amp;c.; (/) claim by the Government of the Union of South Africa for pensions, separation allowances, &amp;c.Some claims in connexion with loss of life and damage as the result of enemy action have not yet been received, and investigations and examination of claims already recorded are not yet completed ; but my Ministers desire that the Reparation Commission should be advised that the approximate amount of the claims by the Government of the Union of South Africa is as stated.General Smuts and South. African Unity. Reuter&apos;s agent reported from Cape-town on 19th June that General Smuts, as Chairman of the head Committee of the South African Party; in an open letter to the Party on the subject of re-union, had announced that he would call a congress of the Party at Bloemfontein on 22nd September, to consider the question of South African Unity according to the following principles, which the Committee intended to lay down as a basis of re-union: First, the people of South Africa have no desire to limit its future political development as a free people, and leave the door open for the evolution of that freedom under Divine Providence, recognizing at the same time that any far-reaching change in the form of Government can only rest on the broad basis of the united will of the people, i.e., of all sections of the white population. Secondly, it is accepted that it is not in the best interests of South Africa to agitate for any change in our form of Government as laid down in the Constitution, and that our constitutional development should be left to the natural course of circumstances. Thirdly, no obligations or responsibilities towards other parts of the British Empire, or other countries, which are contrary to the interests or derogate from the existing status of South Africa, shall be undertaken.The SouthAVest Africa Protectorate-On. 17th June ReuteFs Capetown agent telegraphed as follows : To-day General Smuts, in the Union House of Assembly, moved a resolution for the extension of the Treaty of Peace and South-West Africa Mandate Acts until July 1921. He explained that the object of the Acts had still to be carried out to a considerable extent, notably as regards the property of German subjects not domiciled in the Union. Another object of the Act was.to give the necessary power for carrying out the mandate. This had not yet been received, and he did not know when it would arrive. Asa result the Government was placed in a difficulty, for they had to go on with their task. They had been governing the South-West Protectorate under a mild form of martial law; but that position was indefensible and injustice might be done to the population of the South-West. General Smuts said he thought they ought to take up the position that they had a mandate, the general scope of which was set out in section 22 of the Peace Treaty. He considered they should adopt the attitude that they ought to go on with the settlement and government of that country, that they should exercise the trust imposed upon them on 7 th May 1920, and arrange a proper government as required by the provisions of the Act. He detailed the steps already taken in the direction of establishing proper provisions for good government, and announced that during the recess he hoped to visit the South-West territory to meet all sections of the community and discuss the present circumstances and problems with them. Mr. Merriman seconded the resolution and took the opportunity to pay a tribute to the administration of Sir Howard Gorges.Telgraphing again two days later he reported that the Union House of Assembly had accepted the motion, in view of the fact that the object for which the Acts had been introduced still remained, to a considerable extent, to be carried out.An amendment in favour of the appointment of a representative Parliamentary Commission to conduct an inquiry into the question of the future government of the-Protectorate was adopted.The Nationalists alone voted against the motion.The report of Sir Howard Gorges, Administrator of the Protectorate of South-West Africa, says that, on the whole, progress during the last year was satisfactory. Relations between all sections of the community have been better, and the country is settling down to work: it needs an increased population, but immigrants-without capital are not suitable. For the first time since the occupation, revenue&apos;has over-taken expenditure and there should be little or no financial difficulty during the next few years, provided that the diamond industry continues in its present favourable condition.
Lord and Lady Buxton.-On 17th June a farewell banquet was. given to Lord -and Lady Buxton at Pretoria, and Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed the gist of His Excellency&apos;s speech as followsSouth Africans should be thankful that during the period of the war they had been immune, from the ills which befell other countries, and had been able to steer an -even keel. (Applause.) They might congratulate themselves also that the Union, -which was a Union entirely of their own creation, had fully justified its existence. (Loud cheers.) The Union had not brought about the millenium. There had been most anxious difficulties and problems to deal with, yet he did not think that anyone could deny that every year of its existence the Union had strengthened and solidified its position. (Cheers.) It had acquired the best of all possessions, confidence in its own powers, reliance on its own resources, and belief in its future.   (Hear, hear.)His Excellency, in a brilliant peroration,, laid great stress on the fact that the Union still, had to justify its existence in quieter times, in times of peace. It had problems to face far transcending those of the other Dominions, and must overcome provincial sentiment, feeling, jealousies, and antipathies, the relics of the past. It must allow the past to sink into oblivion, and bring about a friendly and permanent fusion of the two great white races. (Loud cheers.) &quot; Nationality here,&quot; the Governor-General concluded, &quot; cannot be racial. It can only exist if it blends together on terms of equality and unity the great qualities of the two white races of South Africa. (Cheers.) Together they can form one nation, but no nation can be formed from one race. (Hear, hear.) . It has been a source of deep satisfaction to me to feel that, even for a short period, I have been associated with a country with such a remarkable individuality, such a deep interest and such a splendid outlook before it.&quot;   (Loud and prolonged cheers.)The native gathering on the racecourse gave the Governor-General a rottsing reception with most picturesque native hymns and cries of greeting. Lord Buxton, in his address, referred to the victory of the King and the Allies in the great, war,&apos; -and laid stress on the loyalty of the chiefs and natives who were law-abiding and peaceful, a fact which the King had noted and greatly appreciated. His Excellency -also referred to the fact that the Native Bill had been read for a second time in the Union House of Assembly without a division, which indicated that there was a body of public opinion in the Union which believed that a real and genuine step forward should be taken in the interests of the natives. He next referred to the appointment of native commissioners who would advise the Government in all matters affecting the natives.&quot; There is no snake in the grass,&quot; declared Lord Buxton, with pointed emphasis, and he asked them to pvit away any suspicion they might have, and believe that the Government and Parliament were anxious to make a genuine attempt to enable the natives to express their views and get into better touch with the European community. Further proposals for their advancement were under consideration.Three days later there was a banquet at Johannesburg in honour of the Governor-General and Lady Buxton. According to Renter&apos;s correspondent in his after-dinner speech his Lordship referred to the heavy taxation in the United Kingdom which &quot; was not pleasant, but was being borne with fortitude and without complaint.&quot; This was received with a large outburst of cheering, and it was evident&apos;that the Johannes-burghers were much pleased when the Governor-General declared that the relations between workers and employers had much improved and praised the success obtained -at the round-table conferences. He urged all parties in a spirit of conciliation to meet in the very strongest fashion the emergency clue to the position of the low-grado mines. (Cheers.) A matter of transcending importance was the relations between the two &quot;white races and it was a most promising sign that, in spite of the bitter past, their relations in the Transvaal were better to-day than in any other part of the. Union.   (Loud cheers.)American Trade Bureau. ReuteFs Paris correspondent telegraphed on 10th June saying: Mr. Perry J. Sevenson, of Washington, has arrived in Paris on his way to Johannesburg (South Africa) to open the first office in that country on behalf of the United States Department of Commerce. The very friendly attitude of South Africa towards the United States, coupled with the big commercial possibilities of . the country, are, it is explained, responsible for the decision to establish a bureau there. America has conducted three trade investigations in South Africa, one in 1912 -on cotton goods, the second in 1915 on agricultural machiuery, and the third on.
electrlcal goods which is still proceeding. In the course of an interview, Mr. Sevenson. said that trade between South Africa and the United States was increasing steadily every year, and that, with the establishment of a permanent trade bureau there, the-commercial relations of the. two countries would be largely stimulated.The Asiatic Question. Reuter&apos;s Capetown correspondent reported on 10th June that the Minister of the Interior, replying to a question in the Union House of Assembly, had stated that an official had been appointed, and that the restrictions-would be partially relaxed with a view to facilitating the repatriation of Indians in. accordance with the recommendations of 27th May [B.E.R., xviii., p. 11].
