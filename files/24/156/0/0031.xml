General Labour Situation. The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 20th November: -The week under review has been notable, from the point of view of the general public, as containing the second anniversary of the armistice. Attention has been concentrated to a considerable extent upon the ceremonies that have taken place in connexion with that anniversary; and consequently there are no new developments of importance to report with regard to&quot; the labour situation.Apart altogether from what may be described as the more permanent effects of the coal strike in reducing reserves of coal, and in affecting foreign commerce, many trades are still suffering from its immediate results, in the unemployment or reduced employment of large numbers of workpeople. The resumption of work in the coal mines, however, has been attended by remarkably little friction, and the only industrial trouble arising out of the strike, in the other occupations affected, has been among tramway workers in Lancashire and the Potteries. Here the trouble has arisen out of the question of the reinstatement of the guaranteed 48-hour week. Similar trouble on the railways has been obviated by. the fact that the guaranteed week was not suspended.The most important event of the near future is perhaps tbe full congress of the International Federation of Trade Unions, which is to &apos; meet in London on the 22nd November. This congress is of interest for two reasons. The choice of London as the meeting place is an event of some significance, in view of the fact that the English trade union movement, as a whole, has shown itself in the last year somewhat indifferent to the policy and aspirations of the officials at the headquarters of the Federation, particularly with regard to the boycott of Hungary. Secondly, the agenda before the congress is ambitious, and deals with practical international problems of considerable difficulty, and of supreme importance. The congress will therefore afford some test as to the value of the International Federation as an effective organization of workers. A third matter is of some interest, namely, the question at issue between the Trades Onion congress and the General Federation of Trades Unions, as to the claim of the former to the sole right of representing the English trade union movement on the international body..COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Sultan and the Settlement. Lord Allenby reported on 13th November [No. 1089] that he had had an audience with the Sultan, whom he informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would invite a nominated delegation to discuss the details of their policy, when this had been decided. The Sultan expressed his pleasure at this information. He went on to say that ZagbluFs influence was becoming weakei-, and that a feeling was growing against the surrender of British control. The fear that Lord Milner had accepted all of ZaghluPs demands had caused general alarm.The Sultan contemplated making a tour of Egypt during the winter, and he, Lord Allenby, had approved the idea. His recent visit to Daman-hur was a great success, and his popularity had of late greatly increased.PALESTINE.The Settlement of Boundaries. On 10th November Sir Herbert Samuel reported [No. 363] the passing of a resolution which had been submitted to the Advisory Council without his knowledge, but which he hastened to forward with the assurance that in it Palestine spoke with one voice. The resolution was to the effect that to assure tlie economic future of the country the waters of the Litani and the eastern
tributaries of the Jordan should be included within the northern and north-eastern, boundaries of Palestine.. This resolution was initiated by Ismail Bey, a prominent Moslem, and Suleiman Bey Nassif, a Christiau, and was supported by Jewish members and others representing various interests in Palestine ; whilst the Council as a whole had requested that it should be submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government without delay, in the name of the country, its people, and. its interests.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xxviii, p. 4], Telegraphing [No. 281] on 12th&apos; November, the Viceroy reported that the Wana Waziris had failed to attend the jirga on the 10th November to which they had been summoned. Moreover, Waziri raiding parties, encouraged apparently by the Afghan Haji Abbas Razak, had recently been very active. Consequently, operations had been ordered to begin on 12th November, and would be carried out in two phases, of which the second would include the advance on, ancl occupation of, Wana. During the operations every opportunity would be given to the Wana Waziris to accept our terms.On 16th November the Viceroy reported [No. 370] that the column formed, to advance on Wana had proceeded with no opposition beyond sniping as far as Haidari Each, where it halted on the 15th for two days for road construction. The local Mahsuds were exhibiting a very friendly attitude ancl were furnishing information about the AVaziris which was full and accurate.On 19th November the Wana column was reported as having reached Sarwakai the previous day. There had only been slight sniping, and no casualties had occurred.The Viceroys Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on 8th and 14th November: I. (8th November). The non-co-operation movement is not gaining many practical adherents, and the attempt to seduce schoolboys at Aligarh, Lahore, and Amritsar is condemned by the great body of the public, especially parents, who realize the serious consequences. Gandhi, however, although defeated in the first round, will not give up the tight, and as he is criticized for attacking Sikh and Mohamedan institutions first, is said to be about to tackle Benares and Allahabad. The constant tours of Gandhi and the Ali brothers, and the unceasing stream of virulent attacks on the. Government in the press and on the platform, sustain an atmosphere of permanent excitement, creating a strong anti-Government feeling of a dangerous character among the masses, and familiarizing them with the idea of the extremist politicians as to complete swaraj ancl independence of Great Britain. As advised by the Bombay Government, we do not contemplate prosecution in the single case of the Central Caliphate Committee or of the executive leaders of the non-co-operation movement, as that has been nominally endorsed by congress, and any general prosecution would be likely to consolidate against the Government many shades of political opinion, and would hinder the natural development of disruptive forces now manifesting themselves among the extremists. In many quarters there is a strong feeling against Gandhi&apos;s vagaries, but. it is not yet well organized. The opinion is still held by some that the movement will kill itself by its own folly and violence. A vigorous stand has been taken against it in every province, ancl there are signs of an organized opposition in Bihar, the United Provinces, Bombay and Bengal. Our policy, therefore, will continue on existing lines. We are about to issue a resolution explaining the policy hitherto adopted, i.e., non-interference as far as is compatible with the public safety, ancl our intention to continue this policy, unless and until compelled to abandon it in the interests of law-abiding citizens, to whom strong appeal is made for concerted effort to stop any further extension of mischievous propaganda among students and illiterate masses. Besides prosecutions for definite breaches of the law, we are considering the adoption of other means of impeding the non-co-operation movement,. e.g., under the telegraph ancl postal codes, to stop objectionable telegraphic and postal matter, ancl to withhold Government advertisements from papers advocating non-co-operation. The volunteer movement has also our careful attention and will be the subject of a later communication when we have received fuller information arid the opinions of the focal Governments.
Provincial reports are as follows : United Provinces. The latest developments of Aligarh College have been fully reported to you by the Education Department. The following appreciation of the results of Gandhi&apos;s and the Ali brothers&apos; tour in the province is furnished by the Local Governments : &quot; At each place visited big meetings were held. The speeches delivered were, in almost all cases, seditious in spirit and frequently in letter. The speeches are under examination by&apos; the legal advisers to see whether they violate the law. The result will be reported later. The visit of the party to each centre was the occasion of local ebullition, which died away when they left. The newspaper excitement was maintained for propaganda, a thing apart. The result on public opinion is neither wide nor permanent. The Caliphate question and the Punjab incidents were used only for inflammatory purposes. Their redress is no longer the main object. That non-co-operation is the sole means to complete the freedom which will redress all grievances is the common line taken. There has been little success in securing proof of practical non-co-operation. A few honorary magistrates gave up their offices, and a few legal practitioners have withdrawn from practice. On the other hand, all loyal men, and even many waverers, have been shocked by the violent language used, and their eyes have been opened to the dangers which are being run. At length they realize the need of counter-propaganda and&apos; of counter-organization.&quot; Two persons have been convicted of sedition. There is no dearth of candidates for the election. Kisan Sagha appears divided, some favouring non-co-operation, others anxious to have cultivators represented on the new council. The trustees of the Kayastha Pathshala, Allahabad, protested against the non-co-operation movement as applied to students. The Lieutenant-Governor has been making a useful tour, visiting educational institutions and advising the students, while taking a natural interest in political discussions and debates, to avoid practical politics until their students&apos; days are. over, and not to sacrifice their college career to any will-of-the-wisp outside their college studies.Punjab. The situation as to colleges and schools in Lahore is improved. Lala Hans Raj&apos;s lecture to students, in which he pointed out the grave consequences of their adoption of non-co-operation, had a sobering effect.The D.A.V. College Government and the Form an Christian College are now normal. The Islamia College was closed for a fortnight, but it is hoped that the bulk of the boys will attend college before long. The decision of the trustees of Aligarh is likely to have a beneficial reaction on the colleges in the Punjab. The Council of Khalsa College, Amritsar, has strongly condemned non-co-operation, but according to a press message, the Council of the M.A.O. Collegiate School, in the same city, has resolved to renounce the Government grant, and to seek dis-affiliation from the University. Political activity among the Sikhs continues to be a serious feature, but confidential reports just received show that the Sikhs are by no means, as a whole, accepting the policy of their extremist leaders, and the Sikh Conference was largely attended by Hindus and Mohamedans, while Sikhs of position and wealth were conspicuous by their absence. These are indignant with the efforts of the non-co-operation party to pervert Sikh students. From Jullundur it is reported that the Jats are everywhere becoming involved, and are beginning to talk of non-payment of revenue. Private arbitration courts have been set up in some places. Public meetings have been held at Lahore expressing sympathy with Ireland on the death of McSwiney.Bombay, There is nothing special of interest to note, but developments at Aligarh are being keenly followed, and are likely to have a stabilizing effect upon movements in this province. Attempts to hold an anti-non-co-operation meeting under the presidency of Sir Chimman Lai Setalvad, Mrs. Besant being one of the speakers, were broken up by hooligans, according to a press report. District officers are being circularized as to the necessity for adequate although unobtrusive police precautions in the event of disorders during the elections. The widest possible publicity is being given to the terms of sections 171 C. and F. of the Indian Penal Code. The leaders of the non-co-operation movement have carefully avoided reference to the penalties, under these provisions, attaching to undue pressure on voters or candidates for election, and this knowledge, now filtering through to the rank and file, may have a salutary effect. Some resumption of the hijrat movement is being-talked of by the Central Caliphate Committee, not unchecked as before, but under the Central Committee&apos;s guidance; only selected men likely to be of economic
gain 10 Afghanistan, are being permitted to go. Excitement prevails in Sindli among the schools. The Council of the National Federation of India, met under the presidency of Sevaswami Aiyer, protested against the Government handling of the Punjab disturbances, but condemned non-co-operation as a dangerous weapon which would tend to retard the progress of thr country. &quot;They objected to the Esher Committee^ Report and to the export of wheat.Bengal.-The Caliphate Committee continues to lead in advocating non-co-operation, and the organization of Committees in Mofussil is being undertaken. Abul Kalam Azad has proposed a scheme of separate sub-committees, with provincial branches for each item of programme, adding the additional item of insisting on troops leaving the army. As the result of propaganda by B. G. Pal and others, a few resignations have occurred, but the extremist leaders are now less confident that their decision to boycott elections was wise, telegrams having been received by the Government asking for extension of time up to the 15th November for the submission of nominations. Discontent among the subordinate police is on the increase, and there are threats of a concerted strike on the 15th November. In spite of the recent introduction of new rates of pay, further revision of pay has been sanctioned, atid it is hoped that the matter will not be pushed to extremes. Durga Das Chatterjee, who has for some time past been making objectionable speeches, has been prohibited from speaking in public for one year. Students of the Anglo-Persian Department, the Calcutta Madrassa, having gone on strike en masse on the opening day, the Director of Public Instruction closed the school and addressed the parents. As 582 out of 535 guardians desire to keep their wards in the school, the Director has how requested the school authorities to reopen the school on the -8th instant. Meanwhile, Abul Kalam Azad has opened the proposed National Madrassa, near the principal city mosque, said to be attended by. a number of students who left the Calcutta Madrassa recently.Delhi. The chief development in Delhi is the growth of the volunteer movement, which is being watched carefully, and will be dealt with in a separate reference on the movement generally. There are rumours of withdrawals from the schools and colleges. Ansari urges the students tb follow the example of Aligarh and the principal of Ramjas College, advising the students to sacrifice education to moral war with the Government. Two Mohamedan extremists, although refused admission by the headmaster of the Anglo-Arabic school, succeeded in persuading a number of boys to come out on strike. This was followed by meetings, at which general non-co-operation was advocated, but it is too early yet to predict how far it is likely to be successful, and to what extent parents, professors and masters -can counteract this influence. A crowded public meeting was held on 1st, at which resolutions were passed, sympathizing with Ireland on the death of McSwiney and in her struggle for freedom ; in support of non-co-operation ; urging the local municipality and public bodies not to present any address to the Duke of Con-naught ; condemning the action of the trustees of Aligarh College; and sympathizing with sufferers in the cause of the Caliphate.Colonel Wedgwood &apos;s arrival, and the opening of the Trade Union congress, collected the extremist leaders in Bombay. Lajpat Rai, president, made the stock attack on the exploitation of workers, and, inter alia, resolutions were passed demanding the representation of labour on the Legislative Councils and Chambers of Commerce, as a protest against the attitude of the employers in the recent strikes. The extremists are doing their utmost to annex Colonel Wedgwood, but he has urged the men not to rush into wild and unorganized strikes, and advocates the co-operation of all classes, provided the grant of independence is promised by Great Britain within a fixed period. If, in these circumstances, non-co-operation is persisted in,, he declares that English labour will wash its hands of India problems. Colonel Wedgwood shortly visits Lahore and the Punjab, where the extremists are said to be making good preparations for his reception.II. (14th November). The speech of the Viceroy^on 4th November, replying to-the address of the Sylhet Mohamedans, and the issue oh 6th November of the Home-Department resolution on the subject on non-co-operation, appear to have met tb ^sorne extent the general demand for a further public declaration of the Govern-ment&apos;s attitude towards that movement; The Viceroy thanked the Mohamedans for the recognition of the Governments efforts to secure favourable terms for Turkey, and assured them that in everything affecting the welfare of Turkey and the status, -of the Caliphate the influence of India would always be- thrown in the direction 22-4 B
desired by India&apos;s Moslems. Tbe territories inhabited by the Turkish race are intact,, and her finances are free from any share of the burden of the reparation debt. She would soon have round her a ring of prudent (? orthodox) but friendly Moslem states. The need of the moment was to assist her to rebuild on good foundations. His Excellency added a few words on non-co-operation, from which he said the people themselves were the chief sufferers, instancing the hijrat disaster and the attack on Aligarh College. Poor Moslem boys, whose education had been disturbed and perhaps wrecked, were the chief sufferers from the latter. He therefore appealed to Mohamedans, who were more keen about educational advance-ment than anything else, to rally round their educational institutions and repudiate the policy of non-co-operation. The speech has produced a good, impression and been favourably received by the press. Press notices of the Home Departments resolution have also been on the whole distinctly favourable. While certain papers like the Englishman criticize the resolution as throwing on the moderates the burden of organizing the counter-propaganda which ought to 1 be undertaken by the Government itself, the majority of the English and moderate papers such as the Pioneer, the Statesman, the Civil and Military Gazette, the Times of India, the New India, the Bengali and the Leader welcome the resolution as a timely exposition of the Governments policy, which has been on the whole successful and should be-continued. The Bengali and the Leader strongly deprecate resort to repressive action, the latter adding that the only real remedy for the present unrest is the redress of the Caliphate and the Punjab wrongs. Even the extremist papers admit the temperate tone of the resolution, though they deny that it affords any solution to the, present difficulties, which can only be cured by the repentance of the Govern-ment. Sir C. Setalvad, who has, returned to public life, made a noteworthy contribution to the discussion in a recent press interview. He condemned strongly the exhibition made by non-co-operators, who broke up the recent lecture of Mrs. Besant, dwelt on the clangers of stirring up class and racial.hatred, emphasized the folly of spurning opportunities afforded by the Reforms Act, denounced the mischievous boycott of schools, and concluded with an appeal to the Government to heal the wounds inflicted on India&apos;s self-respect by the doings in the Punjab, the mishandling of the Caliphate question and. the treatment of Indians in the British dominions.Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya made an important speech to the students of the Plindu University on 1st November. While agreeing that the attainment of the fall responsibility of government under the British Crown is the only certain remedy for Lndia&apos;s wrongs, he did not think that this would be secured by non-co-operation. He was wholly opposed to the withdrawing of boys and girls from the schools and colleges and the abandonment of Government grants, which in the case of the Hindu-University would probably result in the loss of much lucrative aid, i.e., the support of chiefs and zamindars. A press telegram yesterday states that non-co-operators are active in the Hindu University, but the professors and the students fully appreciate the situation. The next meeting of the Court is fixed for 30th November. From Aligarh, Mohamed Ali, the college secretary, and Mohamed Ali, a politician, maintain a wordy controversy in the press, but there is growing evidence that sober Mohamedan opinion is disgusted by the efforts of the latter to wreck Aligarh and other Mohamedan institutions, and counter-propaganda is being organized both in Northern India and elsewhere.Madras reports that a useful speech was made by Mr. Justice Abdul Rahim before the Mohamedan Education Association, condemning the methods of Gandhi and the Ali brothers. &apos;Mr. Andrews has just offered his services to the New National University founded by Mohamed Ali.The Calcutta branch of the European Association, at its annual meeting on 8th November, passed a resolution approving the action of General Dyer in going beyond the immediate needs of the moment at Jallianwala Bagh. The resolution was- most inopportune ; the result can only be the further irritation of Indian feeling at a time when we are calling upon all moderate Indians to take united action against non-co-operation.Punjab. On account of the increased violence of public speech, the Local Government has cancelled the exemption of Amritsar city from the scope of the Seditious Meetings Act, and has asked us to sanction the extension of the Act to the whole of the Punjab with a view to its immediate introduction in the districts of Jullundur and Hoshyarpur.   Orders have been postponed on this request, pending.
the consideration in Council on 17th November, a full statement of the reasons being-called for. Mangal Singh, editor of Akali, has been arrested under section 12-4 (a), and the suspension of his sentence granted, under the amnesty, to Singhara Singh has been cancelled. These acts have been condemned at a public meeting of Sikhs held in Lahore on 12th November as proving the inauguration of a policy of repression. Meantime non-co-operation seems to have had little success so far as the council elections are concerned. Returns up to 9th November show 182 candidates for 55 seats. It is significant that the co-operation meeting recently held at Rohtak was broken up by the counter efforts of co-operators.According to press reports, Colonel Wedgwood had a great reception at Lahore on 7.th November. He said that he had not made up his mind about non-co-operation. What was necessary was the destruction of the present bureaucratic imperialism. India would never get her freedom from the present Coalition Government, but the first Labour Parliament would place her, in the same position as Canada. He assured the Mohamedans that, when this came about, India would be the greatest Moslem Power in the world. Colonel Wedgwood proceeds shortly to Peshawar, where the Chief Commissioner has invited him to be his guest.Bombay. The non-co-operation clique endeavoured in vain to get the Indian Merchants&apos; Chamber to pass a resolution pledging themselves not to elect a repre-sentative to the Council. The proceedings were dissolved on a point of order after they had shown a large majority of speakers against non-co-operation. It is significant that the All-India Trades Union congress, under the presidency of Lajpat Rai, has unanimously adopted a resolution pressing the claims of Labour to have elected representatives on the Legislative Councils. Reports of late October showed that the campaign of non-co-operation was making headway in certain districts of Bombay, particularly in Broach and Ahmadabad, but the present position is unknown. It is announced that the Gujerat National College will be opened at Ahmadabad on 15th October (sic). On the other hand, it is reported that much indignation is felt among parents in Ahmadabad at the nationalization of certain schools. Many students have been withdrawn from these and entertained in. Government schools, which have temporarily relaxed the rules of admission.Delhi. The position as regards the school boycott is believed to bo improved. The Chief Commissioner, however, apprehensive regarding the possible effects of the conference of.ulcma to be held on. 21st and 22nd instant, has suggested the prohibi-tion of the meetings.   The proposal will be considered in Council on 17th November.Madras. The Local Government reports that trouble at the Buckingham mills was largely due to the intrigues of disappointed European, assistants (compare the case of the recent Khargpur railway strike). The lock-out continues, and a Press message states that the mill-owners have applied in the High Court for an injunction against Waclia and eight others, restraining them from addressing workmen, and claiming Rs. 75,000 damages.Burma. The Local Government has asked leave to deport Swami Sardanand, who is alleged to be causing dangerous excitement by his speeches to Burman priests and workmen. We have suggested action under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as a preliminary to more drastic measure of deportation.Bengal. The Local Government reported on 9th November that the situation with regard to the police was serious, and many districts announced the intention of striking on the morning of 15th November. The cause is economic, though the discontent was fanned by agitators. There is danger of the force being stampeded by the action of a few units. To avoid trouble, the Local Government has announced a further concession, which we have confirmed with retrospective effect from 1st October.General. The Esher Report has received considerable attention in the press, Indian critics being almost unanimously hostile.Wheat export continues to be condemned by the Indian press.THE DOMINIONS.Clasps for Medals. On 10th November the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the Officer administering the Government of South Africa, and the Governor of Newfoundland that
the Board of.Trade.had had. under consideration the question of clasps to medals for the Mercantile Marine ancl proposed to issue them as follows :- -(I) In respect of each of the years 1914-18 --Period clasps to the Mercantile Marine Medal for which the qualifying service is as follows : .1914-one montlPs seagoing-service, including at least one voyage through a clanger zone; 1915, 1916, 1917 ancl 1918 to 11th November-three months&apos; seagoing service, including at least one voyage through a danger zone. These clasps would be limited as much as possible, owing to the number of danger zones which&apos; qualify for the Mercantile Marine war medal.(2) Following on award of naval Gallipoli landing clasp: A special Gallipoli clasp to the British war medal, to be awarded to the whole of the crews of merchant ships at the beaches on 25th and 26th April 1915.Lord Milner asked those to whom the telegram was addressed to inform him whether this proposal would be acceptable to their respective Governments.In reply to this the Governor-General of Canada reported on 13th November that the proposal was acceptable to the Government of Canada..;/ And on 16th November the Governor of Newfoundland telegraphed the acceptance by his Ministers.Income Tax. The Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed on 16th November to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the Officer administering the Government of South Africa, and the Governor of New-foundland, informing them, with reference to Resolution XV. of the Imperial War Conference, 1917, that the Government of India were considering the measures to be taken by them in pursuance of the proposals made by the Loyal Commission on Income Tax for the relief of double taxation within the Empire, and had enquired whether the Dominion Governments were taking action to the same end, ai:d, if so, in what form ancl to what.extent they proposed to grant concessions. The Secretary of State for India had asked that the outline of any scheme existing or in contemplate-tion might be telegraphed.In reply to this the Governor-General of New Zealand reported on 24th November that the Parliament of New Zealand had enacted in 1916 that income derived by a person resident in New Zealand from the United Kingdom or any British Dominion and subject to income tax there should not be liable to income tax in New Zealand. No further action was contemplated.Procedure regarding German Reparations.- On 20th. November the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa : Please inform your Prime Minister that the following agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government was arrived at on .11th November regarding discussions with the German Government as to reparation: (1) The allied technical experts will meet at Brussels, sitting with the German experts. The experts will report to their Governments and the prdees-verbal of their meetings will be communicated to the Reparation Commission. (2) A conference of the allied Ministers will meet at Geneva after the holding of the plebiscite in Upper Silesia, but at latest during the first fortnight of February, to discuss the entire question of reparations, the total amount of German debt, the examination of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, &amp;c. The representatives of the German Government will take part in this conference in a consultative capacity, as at Spa. The members of this conference will report to their respective Governments, and each Government will then inform its representative on the Reparation Commission of the conclusions at which it has arrived on the report of its representatives at the Geneva Conference. (3) The Reparation Commission will then proceed, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, to declare the total amount and means of payment of the sums due by Germany, ancl will report to the Powers upon Germany^ capacity to pay. (4) The Supreme Council will then meet to consider what further steps require to be taken, including guarantees and penalties.CANADA.Bacon. On 12th November the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of Canada as follows with reference to the formePs telegram of 5th November [B.E.R., xxx, p. 7]: The Food Controller has been informed by the
New York Mission that the Canadian packers have accepted 35 cents for the September, and 34- cents for the October put down, subject to the adjustment of&apos; technical conditions, and have made suggestions for the price of the November and December put down. The Food Controller assumes these arrangements are satis-factory to the Canadian Government. The November and December price is under consideration.&apos;J.o this the Governor-General replied on 17th November saying that the arrange-ment was satisfactory to his Government.Armistice Day. The Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on 13th November, that a fitting celebration had been held in commemoration of Armistice Day, and that, in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty the King, there had been a complete suspension of all. normal business, work and locomotion throughout the Dominion during the two minutes&apos; silence commencing at 12 o&apos;clock noon.Bessarabian Treaty. On 18th November Lord Derby reported from Paris [No. 1342] that he had that day signed the Bessarabian treaty on behalf of Canada.Miscellaneous. The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs : (1) A Federal Order-in-Council has been passed at Ottawa permitting prospecting and development work for natural gas in the Dominion forest reserves, which comprise 28,000,000 acres in the prairie provinces and in British Columbia. Royalties on oil discovered on Crown lands are fixed for the first five years at not more than 5 per cent, or less than 2-^- per cent. ; for the second five years not more than 10 per cent, or less than 5 per cent.; and thereafter 10 per cent.(2) It is announced that out of 2,000 returned soldiers now located on British Columbia farms, over 1,600 will meet their principal and interest payments this year, in spite of the adverse season there.(3) Business conditions in Canada are fairly satisfactory and bank clearings last week were 21 per cent, in excess of those for the corresponding period last year.AUSTRALIA.Japan and former German Colonies. On 15th November the following telegram from the Governor-General of Australia was&apos; received by the Secretary of State for tbe Colonies : The Commonwealth Government are greatly surprised at the Japanese Govern-ment&apos;s request in regard to the former German colonies, and cannot agree to the proposals outlined. The Commonwealth Ministers cannot understand why the British Government is still considering requests from Japan in regard to a matter definitely settled long ago by the Supreme Council and embodied in a treaty, which has been duly ratified. The Japanese Government is endeavouring to amend the conditions of the mandate to introduce the thin edge of the wedge of racial equality and the conditions obtaining for class &quot; B &quot; mandates in regard to trade. Both these proposals will be resolutely resisted by the Commonwealth Government.The Commonwealth Government cannot agree to grant any rights to Japanese subjects inconsistent with the general policy of the Commonwealth in regard to the islands. They cannot entertain the suggestion that there should be a recognition of so-called vested rights and interests, either such as were in existence prior to 1st August 1914 or subsequently. We are starting with a clean slate. Every claim to any interest or right, whether by British nationals or others, will be considered on its merits, and the Commonwealth Government can make no general exception in favour of. Japan. :v; -Although there is on the part of the Commonwealth Government no intention to exclude Japanese ships from having access to Port Rabaul, any more than there is any intention to exclude British, American or French vessels, we claim the right to^ make such laws as we please in respect to trade, and trade includes navigation ; we&apos; cannot therefore give an undertaking in this respect.Further, we can give no special undertaking as requested by Viscount Uchida, as to the right of residents to the exercise of occupations.The fact of the matter is that the attitude of Japan is one which the British &apos; Government, we respectfully submit, ought not to encourage.   It is directly opposed to the solemn obligations of the treaty and the clear understanding arrived at in 22-1 C
regard to &quot;0&quot; class.mandates. The Commonwealth Government stands resolutely on the letter of the bond.We are surprised too at the attitude of France, which is, it is understood desirous of obtaining the same trading rights as under &quot; B &quot; class mandates. We cannot agree to this. We are opposed also to any attempt by the Japanese or French Governments to alter the covenant to permit of the erection of fortifications or training troops for any purpose other than that set out in the covenant.The Assembly of the/League, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Government, has neither authority nor right to modify mandates in any way, and the Common-wealth Government hope this view will be most strongly supported by the Empire delegation.Conference of Admirals.--The Secretary of State for the Colonies received a telegram on 16th November from the Governor-General of Australia in regard to the proposed meetings of the admirals of the China, East Indies and Australian stations. The Commonwealth Government, it said, suggested that the first meeting should be held about March next in Melbourne, and invited the commanders-in-chief of the East Indies and China stations to be the guests of the Commonwealth for that meeting. It was considered that the business to be discussed would deal largely with the resources of Australia, and it would be better if first-hand particulars were obtained in Australia; further, during the last few years much information regarding the Pacific, which would be of great use to the conference, had been collected by the Navy Office at Melbourne.Study of English by Japanese Officers.

The method of financing the purchase is being discussed with the High Commissioner.On 16th November the Governor-General sent the following reply : The Prime Minister appreciates the action of the Food Controller with regard to storage charges, &amp;c, and notes that the method of financing the purchase is being discussed with the High Commissioner, who, however, has been informed already of Mr. Massey&apos;s desire that the same procedure in respect of payment should be followed as during previous contracts.Freight Rates.-On 17th November the Governor-General of New Zealand -telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows :  A representative deputation of the New Zealand cheese producers waited upon the Prime Minister to-day and called special attention to the fact that recently there has been a serious increase in the. freights on cheese between New Zealand and England. The old rate was l\d. per lb. plus 5 per cent.; the new rate is l\d. per lb. plus 10 per cent. This increase has been made just after the sale of New Zealand cheese had been agreed upon as between the producers in the Dominion and the merchants in the United Kingdom. The pecuniary loss involved by these increases will be serious, and the deputation pointed out that, as it was expected that the Ministry of Shipping would give up the control of insulated space on 30th April next, the present increased rates would be taken advantage of by the shipping companies, engaged in the New Zealand trade after that date at the expense of New Zealand producers. The Prime Minister would be glad if you would look into this matter and endeavour to bring about a reduction in. the rates of freight as indicated, herein. There is also extreme dissatisfaction at the increased rates of freight proposed to be charged for other commodities as well as cheese.
