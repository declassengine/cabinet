GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the reports of the Ministry of Labour for 5th and 12th March :-Relief of Unemployment [5th March].-The situation continues to cause uneasiness, particularly in the mining districts, where unemployment is rapidly increasing. The progress of the various emergency measures, however, is well maintained; &quot;and the number of additional men employed through their operation has increased.In connexion with the introduction of short-time working in Government establishments, the threat of the trade union representatives of the departmental joint industrial councils concerned to secede from, the councils has now been, withdrawn, the workers being satisfied with the assurance they have received, that it is the intention of the Government, and of the official side of the councils, as representing the Government, to adhere to the objects and constitution of the councils, and. to make the fullest possible use of the machinery provided by them.[12th March]. No decision has yet been reached concerning the proposals for the absorption of 50,000 unemployed ex-service men in the building industry. A private conference of the executive councils of the unions affiliated to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives was held, on the 3rd aud 4th March. Some &quot;differences of opinion appeared to exist among the delegates on &quot;the general principles of,dilution. It. is reported that some delegates declared dilution to be totally unnecessary, while others urged that, if it were accepted, there should be adequate safeguards for the protection of the industry. The bricklayers are said to be willing to consider favourably a scheme for increasing the supply of skilled workers by the upgrading of labourers already in the industry, but it is not thought probable that any such proposal will be brought forward unless the Government decide to withdraw their proposals. The Federation have not yet been made acquainted with the Governments proposals to the employers, which were recently submitted by the executive of the employers&apos;federation to their members, with a recommendation that they should be accepted. A ballot vote of the employers is being taken on tbe question of acceptance.Organization of the Unemployed [5th March]. The London district council of --unemployed organizations have recently shown further signs of activity. They are endeavouring to create an unofficial organization, representative of the unemployed of the whole country, with the object of obtaining work or maintenance at trade union rates ; the immediate re-establishment of trade with-Russia ; and the full and complete recognition of the Soviet Government. To this end. they are appealing for the support of the organizations of the unemployed which have been formed in different parts of the country, and have proposed that a national conference be called.The unemployed in the Merthyr area have now organized themselves into one body with a, central, council, whose objects are to bring pressure upon local authorities to provide work or adequate maintenance for the unemployed; to receive and distribute sums for the purpose of alleviating distress among the unemployed and their dependants ; and to co-ordinate the work of all similar organizations with a view to taking concerted action if the occasion for it should arise. The executive committee of 20 members is to consist of representatives of industries iu proportion to their local importance, the miners having 0 representatives, the railwayman, steelworkers and builders 3 each, the shop assistants and bakers 2, and other-trades 3.Movement for Readjustment [12th March]. It is clear that a movement for readjustment is taking shape throughout a very wide range of industries, and it is difficult to forecast whatShay be its outcome. It appears that proposals are being-made that the parliamentary committee of the trades union congress should, call a special conference next month, in order to co-ordinate the action of the whole Labour movement to -meet the &quot;united attack on wages&quot;; rumours are also current that endeavours are being made to promote combined action by the triple alliance in this matter,   it is conceivable that some form of agreement for a reduction, of wages and
COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.i - The Official Delegation. Telegraphing [No. 147] on. Sth March, Lord Allenby reported that, in regard. .to the negotiations for the formation of an official delegation, ;after explaining to those concerned what he considered to be the main objects to be aimed at, his policy had been to leave the arrangements in the hands of the Sultan in -consultation, with the leaders. The objects he had indicated had been, that the delegation, should have the best possible prospect of obtaining acceptance of the agreement by a future Representative Assembly, and that it should have the necessary authority behind it to control the situation in the country during the negotiations. He had. also pointed out that the delegation should be in general sympathy with the policy of the British Government.&apos;Mr. GhuraliilVs Mission. The following telegram from Mr. Churchill was received -on .15th March :- .Sir Percy Cox and General Haldane arrived here on the 11th. The conference opened on the morning of the 12th with a short introductory meeting followed by formal political, and military committees for the discussion of reduction of expenditure in Mesopotamia. The political committee, presided over by myself, consists of Sir Percy Cox -and his - staff with officials of the Middle East department, the Arab Minister being called in ;(as) required. The military committee, presided over by GeneralsCongreve, &quot;consists of General Haldane and his staff, Ironside, Trenchard and his staff, Radclifff ?)e and Crosland. The two committees will hold combined meetings to co-ordinate recommendations. Sir Herbert Samuel will arrive on the 16th, by which date I hope to-be free to discuss Palestine and Trans-Jordania.leaving the Mesopotamia -committees&quot; to work out details. Opportunity is also being taken to -consider Aden, Somaliland and the Arab littoral of the Persian Gull&apos;. The High -Commissioner for.Cyprus will, pay a short visit on the 1.8th.INDIA.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xxxviii, p. 3]. The Viceroy transmitted [295 S.] on . 1st March, a telegram, dated the day before, from Sir Henry Dobbs, in which he reported that he had attended the Amirs accession durbar, at which the members of the Russian Mission were also present. The proceedings had been opened by the Home Minister reading a long flattering address, to which the Amir replied, asserting his devotion to his country. Tarsi, standing next to Sir Henry, stated he had. been ,-charged by.&apos;the representatives of two Powers present to, congratulate the Amir. In-acknowledgment the Amir expressed his pleasure at receiving the congratulations of two neighbouring friendly Powers, and his desire to live at peace and harmony with them on one condition, which he left to be inferred, that-the independence of Afghanistan.be respected.   The durbar then terminated.On 4th March the Secretary of State telegraphed [1343] to the Viceroy saying that he could not assent to what was apparently proposed, viz., in the last resort, to sign a treaty- with the Afghans, without&apos;their arrangements&apos;- with the Bolshevik Government being disclosed, and without any stipulation against money or arms-being received, by the Afghans from the Bolsheviks. If the Afghans accepted; -Sir Henry&apos;s proposals, which were-directed against Bolshevik consulates&apos;and intrigue, they must be prepared to produce the treaty with the Bolsheviks as evidence of good faith, otherwise negotiations must come to au end.   His Majesty&apos;s Govern men t did.-corresponding limitation of. profits may be reached &quot;in one industry, which will set a precedent for a peaceful settlement in all others. On the other hand, there is also the possibility that a case of; direct action by one group of employers, or of workpeople, may &apos;be the cause of extended sympathetic action throughout the country and. precipitate a very serious crisis. &apos;
not contemplate the idea of a double subsidy with any favour, ancl should this appear-in the treaty the conclusion of our own treaty would become impossible. Sir Henry Dobbs was to be instructed that even if the terms of the treaty were disclosed, ancl he thought that they would justify the continuation oE negotiations, he was in the first place to telegraph the terms for the consideration of His Majesty s Government,On 7th March the Viceroy reported [317 S.1 that the instructions contained in the&apos;-foregoing telegram had been repeated to Sir Henry Dobbs, with the additions that (1) negotiations were to be broken off if his demands regarding Bolshevik consulates and intrigues were refused ; (2) the disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty was to be demanded, ancl the terms, if disclosed, were to be reported at once, with his reeom- . mendations, for orders ; (3) Sir Henry was to base his attitude over the Bolshevik: subsidy, in following the injunction of the Secretary of State, on the Viceroy&apos;s November letter [B.E.R., xxx, p. 2]; (4) the treaty was to be made subject &quot;to-ratifications.     &apos; .The Secretary of State telegraphed [1435] his approval of these instructions on 9 th March.Sir Henry Dobbs sent a long telegram, which was transmitted [327 S.] by the Viceroy on 9th March, in which he acknowledged the receipt of the instructions, recorded above, and gave, his considered opinions as to what might be expected to-happen, ancl as to the procedure he would have to adopt, He pointed out that the Afghans would certainly not forgo gifts of arms from the Bolsheviks unless we were prepared to provide the equivalent. Also, the Afghans would demand to see the-whole of our draft treaty before consenting to reply to our requests in this connexion. He emphasised the necessity of his being in a position, if he obtained the disclosure-&apos; of the Bolshevik treaty and the elimination of money gifts, to proceed at once to make-the demands necessitated by his instructions, without waiting for further orders from the Secretary of State.A further telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs was transmitted [399 3.] by the-Viceroy on 10th March. In this he called attention to the striking change in the attitude of the Afghans towards the British ancl the Bolsheviks. For some time past the demeanour of the Afghans had been in marked contrast in its coldness towards the British and friendliness towards the Bolsheviks. Since the accession durbar jthis-had completely changed, and there were constant indications of the reversed condition of affairs. Sir Henry ascribed this partly to the result of the discussion of the Turkish treaty, partly to the good effect of the Duke of Connaughfs speech on the opening of the Assemblies, partly to the fact that the truth about the Bolshevik: regime was leaking out and annoyance at the delay in the ratification of the treaty,, ancl partly as the result of Iris own revelations and tin?1 Afghan hope for liberal terms.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following telegram was sent by the viceroy on 7th March : I. (7th March). Section I. Punjab.--The occurrence at Nankana Sahib has overshadowed everything else. The Sikhs are bound to be inflamed to a dangerous extent by the murder of their co-religionists, but it is hoped the sympathetic attitude taken by the Government will have a steadying effect. In some quarters attempts have been made to throw the responsibility on Government officials. But the Punjab Government has issued a disclaimer and stated their determination to do their utmost to bring the criminals to justice. The fanaticism of the Sikhs is also indicated by the continued seizure of shrines by the Akali Dal party, in (? which) undesirable elements have enlisted. Fifteen members of a party which took possession of a shrine in Amritsar were ex-convicts. Otherwise the situation in the province is reported to be somewhat improved. Gandhi in his recent visits attracted large crowds ; but the people evinced no great enthusiasm or excitement, and his speeches were pitched in a lower key. IBs visit was free from undesirable accompaniments, . and at Lahore he had an interview with the Governor.Section 2. He rebuked the students for their noisy methods, and the lawyers for-their failure to suspend practice. In one or two isolated instances non-payment of the next instalment of laud revenue was spoken of. Panchayats have continued their-activities in Jullundur. In one village the determination of the people not to report. to the magistracy or police led to wholesale pilfering of the crops. In view of the violent speeches made at Lyallpur, Rupar and elsewhere, orders had been issued under tire Defence of India Act requiring Dr. Kitchlew ancl Mr. Rambhaj Datt to-abstain from attending or addressing any public meeting in the province.
q.Section 3. Delhi.J-Some Sikhs endeavoured unsuccessfully to proclaim hartal .on receiving the news of the. Xankana Sahib affair. Their failure has somewhat -embittered their relations. with the Moharoedan. agitators, who again are unpopular with a section of Hindus for advising the Delhi confectioner member to take and retain his seat in the Legislative Assembly. The real basis for the general ill-feeling -appears to be the increasing difficulty of raising funds for agitation. Rival patriots . accuse each other of corruption. &apos;&apos;Section 4. Judgement was pronounced in the Delhi burial case on 1st March. Abdulla and one other accused were sentenced to three months&apos; simple imprisonment -and to furnish security. The other two accused were acquitted. A half-hearted hartal was organized in the afternoon on the news of the conviction being, spread, and an indignation meeting was held, at Ghaziabad outside Delhi.Bengal. The attendance at schools and colleges is satisfactory; the magisterial -enquiry into the Kalighat riot is not yet completed. The Lillooah strikers caused trouble at liowrah station, and interfered with the running of trains; they did -considerable damage at Howrah, cutting the telephone and telegraph wires, setting fire to a railway gate, belabouring workmen who refused to stop work, and holding up trains. There was considerable inconvenience to passengers for several hours and several persons were injured. The situation is how well in hand and the lines and station approaches are all being guarded by police and military. A press agency reports that C. U. Das has been prohibited from entering Mymensingh and that two persons, the secretaries of the local association and of the caliphate committee, have been served with a notice under the Criminal Procedure Code to provide security.Section &apos;5. Burma.-There has been a remarkable development in the political situation. The advanced press advocates complete Home Rule. A. mass meeting on the 27th was largely attended by persons from all over the province, and resolutions in favour of complete Home Rule were carried with enthusiasm. This is probably viewed with disfavour by the Burman deputation and the more responsible leaders of the young Burman movement. Non-co-operation was openly threatened at this meeting. The supporters of the Home Rule movement involving separation from India and --(? Indians) were absent from the meeting. (? Indians), however, are continuing their activities, and the judgement of the Chief Court,, upholding under section 153 (A) Indian Penal Code, the conviction of the editor and the printer of the Rangoon Mail, was made the occasion for much noisy agitation.Section 6.   Central Provinces. In connexion with Dr. Oholkar&apos;s arrest reported last week, disturbances occurred at Nagpur; the arrest was effected without trouble, but a large meeting of protest w-as held, and on the 23rd there was a general hartal, though the mill hands refused to strike in spite of the endeavours, of the non-co-operators.   On the 24th a large crowd assembled to prevent excise auction sales being held at the district court.  -A liquor contractor was assaulted; and the police pressed back the mob towards the city, when it dispersed.   Two European officers and a few police constables were injured, but not seriously.   The mob collected again in the -city and looted several liquor shops, the police force being insufficient to restrain them.   A mass meeting was held at night, but nothing further occurred.   A small military force was requisitioned from Kamptee.   The next morning there was no hartal and the mills were at work.   The schoolboys are still somewhat excited.   The district magistrate prohibited public meetings for one month under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.   On the 25th everything was quiet.   Attempts were made to hold a public meeting, but the crowd dispersed quietly on being informed by the police that the meeting was prohibited and would, be dispersed by force.   The -excise auction did not take place because the contractors were afraid to attend on account of the riot at the district court.   The latest news is that the position is -quieter in the city, and that there has been some- revulsion ot&apos; feeling among the sober -elements.   The  deputy commissioner interviewed the principal non-co-operation leaders and warned them that the Government were determined to enforce orders, -prohibiting meetings and to maintain peace ami order to the full extent of the-force at their disposal.   The leaders promised to use their influence, but would give no guarantee.   The deputy commissioner issued orders under section .144 prohibiting; persons entering the civil lines from the city -except for good reasons, because he feared the possibility of another demonstration at the district court during the hearing; of a case in which Dr. Paranjpye is showing cause against an order prohibiting the picketing of liquor shops.   Pickets are posted at.the principal streets, but no attempt lias been made to disobey orders.   The order under section 144 issued against 26-3 Ti
Baranjpye has since been confirmed and made absolute for two months. The-Governor sent a message to the Council regarding the Nagpur disturbances, in which he repudiated /false statements regarding the Government policy, and stated that the Government would use all lawful and reasonable means for the enforcement of authority by taking action within the law against offenders, and invited support from all responsible persons against the movement directed towards the subversion of&quot; authority and Government.Section 7. North-West Frontier Province. -At a meeting held at Banna on 26th by the local congress committee, very objectionable anti-Government speeches were-made, and the non-payment of income tax was advocated. The caliphate committee-is widening the area of meetings. One has been held in the Bakka Khel limits, and more are proposed among the other Waziris. They are also now openly anti-Government and objectionable. The deputy commissioner proposes to give the-caliphate committee written notice forbidding the holding of meetings anywhere in thedistrictwithout his previous sanction. If the orders are disobeyed, he proposes action under section 40 of Frontier Crimes Regulations against the leaders. Bis proposed action has been approved by the chief commissioner, who has informed us that, should the situation develop and action under the Seditious Meetings Act appear-desirable, he will make an official application to the Government of India.Section 8. Bihar and Orissa. Vigorous action is now being taken under the ordinary law against agitators, and the Governments action is evoking considerable-resentment in the extremist press. The Independent of Allahabad has a daily heading &quot;Tide of Repression &quot; and cites cases. At the same time the&quot;discussion of questions in the legislative Council ou a motion for adjournment indicated the-approval of the majority of members of the Governments action.Madras. Yakub I!asan&apos;s arrest caused much excitement in the Presidency, and complete hartal was observed on the 27th   Four Mopilas were&apos; sentenced to imprisonment for compelling hartal raid preventing non-caliphates from entering the-mosques.Section 9.   General. Gandhi  in   a  recent   tour  in   the  United  Provinces, emphasized the following conditions as essential, to the early attainment of swaraj:  (I) Unity between Hindus and Mohamedans ; - (2) Adoption of non-violent methods ; and (3) The spinning wheel. &apos;-He held aloof from the wilder elements aud conspicuously avoided the Kisan Sabhas. We&apos; have been threatened with two serious strikes, one in the telegraph. department, and the second iu the railways. We made preparations ; but the first is: now definitely off, and the second has been postponed pending discussion.Though we consider it necessary to report all incidents of which information is-received, too much importance should not lie attached to isolated events. In our opinion, the improvement noted in last week&apos;s telegram is generally maintained, but. the Sikh movement is causing anxiety as before.THE DOMINIONS.Conference on State-aided Empire Settlement. -On 28th February the Secretary of State for the Colouies sent the following telegram to the Governors-General of -Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa : The following is a summary of the proceedings of the conference on state-aided&apos; Empire settlement. It was agreed from.the outset that the number of new openings available for other classes of workers in the Dominions depended upon an increase-in the number of primary producers, and that the establishment of settlers from the-United Kingdom as primary producers on land overseas must be the foundation oP any comprehensive scheme of Empire settlement or Empire directed migration. As the outcome of discussions, the conference decided to recommend to the Governments concerned that proposals for such a . comprehensive policy, to be carried out over a period of years, should be definitely formulated at the forthcoming meeting of Prime-
Ministers&apos;, and suggested certain general outlines as a basis for discussion, which may-he summarized as follows :  i(1) His Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to the full financial co-operation of the Dominions concerned, to co-operate, with the Dominion Governments in approved schemes of land settlement to the extent of making advances to settlers up to a maximum of 300?. per settler. (2) His Majesty&apos;? Government and -rthe oversea Governments  concerned to contribute equally towards the cost of such schemes for assisted passages or other kindred schemes as might be agreed upon after the termination of the present British scheme of ex-service free passages. It was intimated thai the amount of assistance which His Majesty&apos;s Government could give would depend both upon the amounts contributed by the Dominions, and upon the financial position of the United Kingdom, but wotdd not in any case exceed-a maximum of 2,000,00()Z. in any one year.In addition to the above recommendations the conference passed the following resolutions : (1) That in cases where money for expenses overseas is advanced to settlers from&apos; Government funds, the money should be paid to the overseas representative in this country on the settlers&apos; account and transmitted overseas for payment to the settlers on arrival.(2) That the bonus system, i.e., the system of recruiting settlers by means of per caput bonus pavments to third parties, should be abolished as from .  1st July 1921.(3) That it- is desirable, in order to emphasize the distinction between the movement of British subjects within the Empire and emigration to or immigration, from foreign countries, that such expressions as &quot; oversea settlement,&quot; &quot;Empire settlement&quot; or &quot;British settlement,&quot; &quot;oversea settlers&quot; or &quot; British settlers&quot; should he used in preference to &quot; emigration &quot; or &quot; immigration,&quot; &quot;emigrants&quot; or &quot;immigrants,&quot; these i latter expressions being confined to movement to or from countries outsidethe Empire.Shipowners&apos; Liability under Bills of Lading. On 9th March the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and the Governor of Newfoundland: The Imperial Shipping Committee have submitted their report on the limitation of shipowners&apos; liability under bills of lading. They recommend unanimously uniform legislation throughout the Empire on the lines of the existing Acts, but based more precisely on the Canadian Water Carriage Goods Act, .1910, subject to provisions in regard to (i) exceptional cases in which goods can be carried at owner&apos;s risk; (ii) the precise definition of the physical limits to a shipowners liability; and (iii) the fixing of the maximum monetary limits of liability. The report deals with methods of deciding upon exceptions ami limits, and in this connexion proposes the establishment, of a special body common to the Empire, and indicates other matters which might be referred to such a body. The constitution of this body and other functions it. might undertake are deferred for a later report. .o The report is&apos; being addressed jointly to His Majesty&apos;s Government and the oversea Governments ; and I understand the chairman is sending a copy by mail to your I &quot;rime Minister. As this particular report of the committee affects the United Kingdom mainly, and it is thought advisable to give time for opinion to form here before the meeting of Prime Ministers next June, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to publish the report here on 16th March provided the Dominion Governments see no objection.H your Government agree, it is suggested that the above summary of the report, should be published in the Dominions on 16th March.The German Counter-Proposals. On 3rd March the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as follows in regard to the German proposals : The allied conferences on the German counter-proposal to the Paris proposals-occupied the whole of the afternoon of 1st March and all 2nd March. Evidence was produced that the inadequacy of the German proposal was due partly to a belief that it was good tactics to minimize their offer, and partly to pressure put by German
industrial magnates and Prussian reactionaries on the German Government. The allies had reason to believe also that the German Government could -make no adequate offer except under the strongest allied, pressure. The Allies, however, agreed that the German proposal, which was little more than a quarter of. the Parisproposal, was totally inadequate, and even as a basis of discussion could not be accepted. The Allies decided, therefore, that it was essential to bring the strongest pressure to bear upon Germany immediately to compel it seriously to face its obligations. They were agreed that without it German, public opinion would never permit the German Government to make adequate reparation, and that Germany would have succeeded, in undermining the whole basis of the treaty itself..unless the Allies showed a united determination to enforce the treaty of Versailles immediately in the matter of reparations to the maximum&apos;of Germany&apos;s capacity. The French Government considered that, as regards the sanctions to be applied, the most effective sanction was the immed tate military occupation of a new part of Germany. The Prime Minister considered that military movements should be reduced to the minimum and that, if they could be made effective, economic sanctions were preferable. The Italian representative was fearful about the effect of drastic action in dislocating Europe, and with his Japanese colleague was inclined to delay. Pie said he would fall into line with the reit of the Allies, however. After discussion it was accordingly decided (A) Toocbtipya small area on the right bank of the Rhine. This would give the Allies control of the main line of railway running south from the Ruhr district, and so give them partial control of the coal trade no extra troops will be required for this. (R) To take the necessary powers to deduct such a proportion as they might think fit from the purchase price of German, goods. Merchants should be required to pay, this into the Allies&apos; Exchequers on account of reparations, forwarding an exchequer receipt td Germany in lieu of such proportion. (C) To take control of the customs of the occupied territory and to institute a customs line down to the Rhine. These decisions were communi--cated to the Germans this morning in a statement -which comprised detailed, justification of the Allies&apos; demands, and the German Government was given until noon -on Monday in order to reply as to whether they were prepared to make proposals which were in accordance with the treaty and could be accepted by the Allies as an adequate settlement of their pains.The Prime Minister hopes that your Government will be willing to co-operate with the Allies in bringing pressure to bear.cn Germany by means of the second sanction above mentioned.On 7th March a telegram was received from the Governor-General of Australia, transmitting this message from his Prime Minister in reply to the above : The Commonwealth Government strongly approves the decision of the conference to-bring the strongest pressure to bear on Germany [? and] they quite agree that it is impossible to get Germany to face its obligations without such pressure. The Govern-ment is of opinion that the amount asked for can he paid by Germany, and that it will be paid as soon as the fact that the Allies are resolutely determined to enforce their demands becomes manifest.: Sanctions A and C are approved by the Commonwealth Government, as also B if applied together with A and C and in respect of the definite sum already decided upon. It is assumed that B relates to deductions from the price received by Germany for all goods sold to foreign countries and that such deductions are paid, into a common reparation fund to be distributed as decided by a previous reparation conference and not to be credited to the allied nations purchasing goods in respect of which the deduction is made.Please note as regards B that in accordance with the present, policy of the Commonwealth importations of German goods into Australia are prohibited,, but that the Commonwealth Government is willing to co-operate with the Allies in enforcing B. . . -,   -Austrian Financial Situation. The following, telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies was sent on 10th March.to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New-Zealand, and South Africa and to the Governor of Newfoundland : In. view of the very uncertain financial situation of the Austro-Hungarian Bank and of Austria itself, it is considered desirable that any currency notes of the Bank; which under Article 206 of the Treaty of Peace with Austria are to be presented to the Reparation Commission, should be presented, as soon as possible. The Administrator of Austrian Property proposes to fix 1st May as the fast date on which
CANADA.Trade Agreement with-the West Indies. On 2nd March the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governor-General of Canada that the trade agreement of ISth June had been accepted by the legislatures of Trinidad, British Guiana, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, the Bahamas, Jamaica and British Honduras ; and that he had approved the agreemeut subject to the approval of the Canadian Parliament. He added that when the Canadian Ministers had fixed with each of the Colonies the date from which the agreement was to be regarded as having come into force as provided in Article .17, he should be glad if he might be informed of the decision in each case.Merchant Marine. The department of External Affairs announces that the Canadian Government Merchant Marine will during the summer have a service from Montreal to India, and another from Montreal to Australia and New Zealand.AUSTRALIA.Wool [B.E.R., xxxviii, p. 12]. Referring to the Governor-GeneraVs telegram of 22nd February, the Secretary of State for the Colonies transmitted the following telegram from the Minister of Munitions on 16th March :-British Wool Realization Association. Your telegram of 22ud February has had careful attention. Perfect agreement .exists on every substantial point, and it is expected that the transfer of assets to the Association can be satisfactorily completed this month. Lawyers are engaged in drawing up deeds recording the terms of&quot; transfer and the agency arrangements. The full text of the proposed deeds will be cabled to Sir John Higgins, wdio will consult the Commonwealth Government on the subject, with a view to an all-round agreement upon the terms of the deeds.Timor. On 10th March the Secretary of State received a telegram from the Governor-General, in which the latter, referring to a despatch from the Consul-General at Batavia regarding reports that Portuguese Timor was under offer to Holland, said that Australia was greatly interested in the future control, of Timor as had been mentioned on previous occasions, and if this territory went to a third party, would be seriously concerned. His Ministers would be glad to receive any information that was available with regard to the reported negotiations for sale.NEW ZEALAND.Meat [B.E.R., xxxviii, p. 12].-The following telegram from the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies was received on. 10th March : My telegram 27th February regarding shipping freights, no reply to which has yet arrived. My Prime Minister has received a telegram from the High Commis-sioner for New Zealand, stating that he has discussed the matter with the&quot;Ministry of Food, with the result that the Ministry offers a compromise on the basis of making-the rates fixed last July applicable to all shipments up to the end of the Government control of refrigerated shipping space, ancl cancelling the slightly higher rates fixed for free meat, March and April loading, and in the event of non-acceptance that it is proposed to maintain these higher rates. This offer is entirely inadequate for meeting the serious position existing. The Government of New Zealand had through the High Commissioner requested that an already announced and withdrawn rate, based on a primage of 5 per cent, less than that which is now offered as a compromise, should be-established, and had further stated clearly that a still lower rate was really necessary under the circumstances. The position existing in this Dominion was fully set out in 25-3 CUnited Kingdom residents may lodge such notes with him, and hopes that Dominion Governments will similarly fix an early lime limit and forward any notes so lodged as soon as possible. Please telegraph the date fixed and the extent to which such notes are known to be held. United Kingdom residents depositing notes are required to state whether notes were held by them in the United Kingdom before 15th June 1919.
my telegram of 27th February, and it has since become accentuated to such an extent that the Government of New Zealand feels compelled to state its opinion that the line of action adopted by the Ministry of Food in this matter of: freight rates is seriously damaging producers. The High Commissioner advises that the Ministry of Food state that an additional 5 per cent, is added to freight rates to cover the cost of administration and dead freights ; thus making it appear that, in effect, New Zealand producers are saddled with His Majesty&apos;s administrative charges and with the extra running costs of shipping consequent upon shipowners being unable to fill non-refrigerated space. The Government of New Zealand feels confident that His Majesty&apos;s Ministers cannot be fully cognizant of the extreme hardship being inflicted on the Dominion, aud respectfully request that the facts of the positiou be fully gone into and that the urgently necessary relief be afforded to producers in the form of an adequate reduction of the freight rates controlled by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Meeting of Parliament.

His Royal Highness referred, first of all to the meeting of the League of Nations at Geneva, at which South Africa had been represented, declaring that this first meeting had raised fresh hopes for the future of this great institution, especially as the need for it was growing in view of the disordered conditions existing over a large part of the world. After alluding to various matters of home policy, His Royal Highness spoke of the waste, destruction, and industrial dislocation brought about by the war, which had created unprecedented conditions of economic depression throughout the world, universal financial stringency, and exchange difficulties which were seriously hampering international trade. The effects of these world-wide conditions, be said, had been felt very severely in South Africa, especially in the agricultural and -mining industries. It. was difficult to find markets abroad for some of their agricultural, pastoral, and mineral exports. Several mines were closing down or curtailing their operations, and unemployment was on the increase. In addition to these - economic troubles the financial position of South Africa, in spite of its general soundness, was becoming difficult, and the ordinary sources of public revenues were being materially affected. The Government therefore proposed to concentrate their attention during the coming session as far: as possible on measures dealing with the financial. and economic situation and the proposals dealing with unemployment. The construction of certain urgent railway lines and other public works had been recommended as a suitable measure for creating additional opportunities for employment. Consideration would also be given to the safeguarding of some of their own industries against unfair competition from overseas owing to the abnormal conditions prevailing abroad.
