GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the Reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending 2nd and -9th October :  .Labour Situation. :During the week ending 2nd October the coal situation passed from one crisis to another. The decision, on the 24th September, of the delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to suspend for one-week their strike notices, which otherwise would have taken effect on the 25th, was followed by conferences on the 25th, 27th, 28th and 29th between representatives of the miners&apos; executive and of the Mining Association of Great Britain. The suggestion, first tentatively advanced by the President of the Board of Trade on the 9th September, that the miners should meet the owners to discuss the possibility of making such a readjustment of remuneration in relation to output as might give a sufficient satisfaction of their wages demand, was thus acted upon. The particular object of these joint meetings was to discover an output datum line, on the determi-nation of which depends the Prime mini steps offer of the 22nd September. On the 29th September the joint conference decided that they could not arrive at an agreed recommendation to the Government, and the owners&apos; and the miners&apos; representatives reported separately their failure to arrive at an agreement which would settle the present dispute. The miners&apos; representatives on this date were of the opinion that no further good could accrue from continued meetings with the owners.The four-monthly period for the operation of the last awards of the Industrial Court for the engineering and shipbuilding industries will expire at the end of November. The trade unions concerned have already denounced the agreement of February .1917, under which the periodic hearings have been held, and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades have now put forward an application for an increase in wages of (id. an hour for their members. Negotiations are also proceeding between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations with regard to such matters as payment for night shifts and overtime. The National Union of Railwaymen have put before the Central Wages Board a claim for an additional 2s. per week for the men included in the conciliation grades under the sliding scale.The labour situation in its more political aspects is comparatively quiet. Atten-tion is being paid to the probable course of employment during the coming winter, and the local London Labour Parties, the National Union of Ex-Service Men, and the National Union of Police and Prison Officers apparently propose to exploit the unemployment in the docks area. As regards the cotton textile industry, it is probable that arrangements will be made between masters and men for organized curtailment of production. Details are given below of the arrangements agreed upon for this purpose in the Northampton boot and shoe trade.The Industrial Courts Act, 1919, continued until the 30th September 1920 the legal force of prescribed and substituted rates of wages which had been fixed under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, 1918-19. On and after the 1st October, therefore, rates of wages will be settled by negotiation between employers and employed, except in those cases where Statutory Orders apply, such as Orders of the Agricultural Wages Boards and Orders under the Trade Boards Acts.The decision of the delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, on the 1st October, to submit to a ballot vote of members the owners&apos; revised datum line offer, marked the end of the second crisis in the coal situation. The expiry of the miners&apos; strike notices had already been postponed to the 2nd October, and, as a result of this decision, a further suspension has taken place until the 16th October. The result of the ballot vote will be known on the 13th, and upon this will depend the further development of the situation. Much discussion has taken place in the last few days upon the question of whether a two-thirds majority will be necessary for a strike, or whether the mere rejection of the owners&apos; offer will suffice. The rules of the Federation do not deal with this point, and the national delegate conference have full power to interpret the wishes of the members as recorded in the ballot vote. It is noteworthy that the ballot paper only allows the miners to choose between the two alternatives of a strike
COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;o.EGYPT.The Zagloulist Delegation.-On 4th October Mr. Scott reported [No. 980] that the seven delegates had left Cairo for Alexandria on the morning of 30th September, and the latter place for Marseilles next day.At Alexandria, he said, they were met by a gathering of notables, including Jewish and Syrian deputations. They were greeted with enthusiasm throughout, although small counter demonstrations were attempted by the extremists. In the afternoon 300 prominent members of the Alexandrian native community, after- a lengthy discussion, passed a unanimous vote of confidence.Telegraphing again on the same day [No. ?], Mr. Scott said that he had heard that the Sultan was somewhat upset in consequence of the delegates not having called upon him, in spite of an intimation from Adly Pasha that they might expect a favourable reception.Russian Refugees. On 7th October Lord Curzon informed Mr. Scott [No. 38] that His Majesty&apos;s Government having agreed to the terms of the Serbian Govern-meut, as soon -as the evacuation of the refugees from Lemnos had been completed the necessary arrangements could be made for the transfer of those in Cyprus and Egypt to Serbia.PALESTINE.Trans-Jordania [B.E.R., xxv, p. 5]. Sir Herbert Samuel reported by telegram [Ho. 297] on Ilth October that the Ajlun country seemed to be quiet, although it was not easy to re-establish administration, and there was some difficulty in the collection of taxes. At the time of reporting, however, this, as wefl as the local administration and the reorganization of the police, was proceeding satisfactorily. The principal obstacles to public security and administrative improvement were the nomad tribes, but these had been fairly quiet of late, and had gone off to their winter pastures.In the Kerak district local administration had so far come into operation as to permit of some revenue being collected for the first time in four years. It was hoped to include Tafile and Maan in this area.or the acceptance of the datum line proposal. Those members of the Federation,, therefore, who would prefer their wages demand to be referred to an impartial tribunal have no opportunity of recording.this opinion. The miners&apos; demand for a reduction, in the selling price of household coal appears to have been definitely abandoned. The cross currents of opinions and interests within the Federation as a whole, and. within each of its constituent bodies, are many and complicated. The national delegate conference decided to hold a second ballot by a comparatively narrow majority ; and the duty of recommending members how to vote has been left to the representative bodies of the constituent organizations.Among other developments of the industrial position in the week, attention may be drawn to the national agreement in the engineering industry with regard to over-time and night work. In the cotton textile industry the proposed short-time working, which will affect the wages earned by nearly the whole of the employees in the spinning section, overshadows the piecers&apos; dispute, which still lingers. The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks are beginning another campaign on behalf of their members in London, and are adhering to their policy of endeavouring to secure a joint reference of their claims to the Industrial Court. The road transport position remains unsettled; but a meeting between representatives of the employers and employed has been arranged for the 8th October.
Afghan Delegation [B.E.R., xxvii, p. 3].-In reply to tbe Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 24th September, the Secretary of State for India telegraphed [2284] on 4th October a general agreement with the views of the Viceroy as expressed in his telegram. The Secretary of State demurred, however, to the proposal as to the gift of arms and ammunition without further consideration of the consequences that might be involved. Besides the risk of the Afghans using such arms against us, there was the danger, as the result of a military defeat, of these arms passing into the possession of the Bolsheviks. Moreover, it would be undesirable to provide the Afghans with arms and equipment on such a scale as might induce them to court disaster in conflict with Bolshevik troops. Any assistance to be given to them should be confined to a light character of arms and equipment, which, while increasing the efficiency of the Afghans in the style of warfare to which they were accustomed, would also restrict them from attempts to go beyond it. The Secretary of State insisted that the signature of a treaty of friendship on the lines proposed must be precedent to the granting of any assistance, and suggested that, when this condition had been fulfilled, a gift of money sufficient to enable the Amir to meet his pressing requirements, would be the best form of assistance. He pointed out that the signature of the treaty would free the Amir to import arms subject to the Arms Traffic Convention, and thought it preferable to defer making any substantial increase to Afghan armament until Afghanistan was actually faced by aggressive measures on the part of the Bolsheviks. The Indian Government was invited to reconsider the matter in the light of the foregoing.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xv, p. 2]. Referring to his telegram [332 S.] received on 25th March, the Viceroy reported [I.F.O.C. 1906] on 23rd September the programme which the Indian Government had decided to follow in dealing with the AVano Wazirs. /The Wazirs are to be summoned to a jirga in the first place, at which they will receive the following terms: the return of rifles taken by them, and payment of a fine ; the surrender of a certain number of rifles belonging to the tribes ; a promise not to obstruct road-making, nor to hinder the movement of Government troops within their territory ; and some minor terms of less importance. One month after this, a final jirga will be held, which-, the Wazirs will be required to attend, and to deposit a certain proportion of the fine imposed, as a guarantee of their intention to submit. A reasonable period will then be allowed for the terms to be fully completed. Should the AVazirs fail to comply at any stage, it would be necessary to begin an advance on Wano, with the hope of inducing submission, if possible, before arrival there.In the opinion of the Indian Government this programme afforded the best chance of obtaining submission, and would not be costly in men or money.The Viceroy s Weekly Tie-ports. The following reports were sent on 2nd and 9th October: i. (2nd October). Discussion in the Press centres round the Congress resolution adopting non-co-operation and its effect on the Congress itself, a change in the consti-tution of which is now freely urged, even by Lajpat Rai. Resignations from candidature are reported from various provinces, in number about 80, but Malaviya, wdio has characterized the boycott of councils as a dangerous doctrine, is standing himself and advises others also to stand, as power within the councils, if returned, is greater than outside them for attaining the ideal fulfilment of (? modified) Government, and exposing the misdeeds of the executive Government. Shastri has been delivering useful lectures on the same subject. The Bengali states that &quot; in Bengal at any rate there is no question that public sentiment is entirely against non-co-operation.&quot; The New India (Madras) considers that the Congress struck a deadly blow at national progress; while Madras reports that it is unlikely that the resolution will find wide acceptance in the presidency. The boycott of foreign goods is attacked as foolish and impracticable. The Leader (Allahabad) points out that the boycott will not paralyse the Government; and Sir Chandavakar describes the failure in Poona, in the seventies, of private arbitration courts set up as a protest, owing to the innate spirit of litigiousness; Gandhi is said to be issuing a manifesto urging voters to refrain from voting for any candidates for the reformed councils. In view of possible attempts being made to prevent candidates from standing, or voters from voting by a threat
-of social boycott or other means, we are pointing out to the Local Governments, with a view to uniformity of action, that the Corrupt Practices Act .makes the exercise of undue influence affecting the electoral right an offence punishable with imprisonment, and urging prosecution in such cases.The report of the Congress sub-committee (Gandhi, Patel, Motilal Nehru) has been published with an invitation to the public to submit criticisms before 2nd October.. The committee state that the Congress has approved of the whole of Gandhi&apos;s-programme of progressive non-violent non-co-operation, but has adopted for immediate-use items in the first stage only. The Congress will determine the pace for the remaining three stages, namely, the resignation of civil and military employment and the suspension of payment of taxes. As regards the items in&apos;the: first stage the committee suggest: (a) Deputations should approach all title, holders, and explain the illusory misconception about hollow Government gifts; but undue pressure and violence of language should be scrupulously avoided, (b) A boycott of Government schools and colleges as the easiest step owing to the growing political consciousness of. parents and the older students. Government employment, to which present education leads, must be spurned. The closure of Government schools will create a demand for national schools. Meanwhile, children should receive private -education or be apprenticed to patriotic merchants or artisans. Aided schools should dispense with Government grants, (e) The Government wield tremendous power through the law courts. Lawyers must therefore boycott the courts, and instead of devoting their leisure to public movements, must become whole-time publicists devoting their services to national schools, private arbitration, or propaganda work. A deputation is to approach the lawyers for the above ends. Pandit Motilal Nehru further suggests the immediate establishment of arbitration courts, and the application of boycott against those who defy the orders of such courts, (d) The boycott of councils is of the greatest importance. The deputation should approach candidates. Electors&apos; signatures should be secured to a manifesto declaring their unwillingness to be represented in the council until the Punjab and Caliphate wrongs have been redressed, (e) &quot;Vigorous propaganda to be urged against possible recruits for Mesopotamia (in this connexion it may be noted that the campaign to &quot; call back our ariaies &quot; is being energetically pushed by the Bombay Chronicle and the Independent). (/) The boycott of foreign: goods is considered an unfortunate interpolation due to misapprehension; but co-operators must simplify those wants, the satisfaction of which depends on foreign supplies. Great importance is attached to the revival of hand spinning and hand weaving; spinning classes are to be formed, and Swadeshi workers to communicate with the manager, Satyagraha Ashram, at Ahmedabad. Lajpat Rai has written to the Press objecting strongly to the description of this item as a mischievous interpolation, (g) The collection of a large national fund is to be urged, and the formation of a volunteer corps to engender discipline and maintain order. (Ji) Where sufficient workers are available, they are to be divided into batches, each responsible for some special item of work; where few workers are available, concentration mainly on the boycott of councils in which results must.-be shown before December. In all cases a complete interwoven organization in the province, district, town, and taluk is necessary.       .   .2. The All-India Congress Committee meets on 2nd October in Bombay to consider these proposals, the general reception of which in the country remains to be seen ; but there are clear and continued indications that the extremists derive much encouragement from the events in Ireland and Egypt, which they state prove the value of non-co-operation methods.3. The case against Zafar Ali Khan under sections 124a and 153a of the Indian Penal Code continues in Lahore. The accused pleads not guilty, but will not defend himself beyond making a statement and will not cross-examine witnesses ; it is said that no great sympathy is felt for him in the Punjab.4. The returned muhajarins are reported to be rapidly settling down. Junejohas returned from Kabul and will go home. On arrival at Peshawar he stated that he was ruined and disillusioned. Appeals have been made in the Press by Moslems for contributions and assistance to keep the returned muhajarins.5. Dissatisfaction is expressed in the extremist Press at the acquittal of Chilcot in the Kachagarhi trial, ancl - demands are made for an impartial enquiry. The statement describing the action taken by the Government of India against the officers censured in connexion with the Punjab disturbances is severely criticised by the opposition Press as being inadequate. The moderates also criticise, but urge that 21-2 ji
the failure of the Government to do justice forms no-excuse for the non-co-operation campaign.6. In the United Provinces the Liberal Party has started an up-to-date Urdu daily paper to voice the views of the sober-minded section of community.7. In the Willoughby murder case, two of the accused pleaded guilty to the charge of murder and were sentenced to death. The case is proceeding against the--third accused on the charge of abetment.8. The strike of Europeans at Jamshedpur has been settled; the strikers are receiving 10 per cent, increase over their average earnings with retrospective effect from 1st March. The Bombay Post Office aiid the telegraph peons struck work owing to dissatisfaction with the new rates of pay sanctioned by the Government.. The discontent also spread to Madras, where the support of the public was appealed for, and valuable assistance was given by Boy Scouts and Girl Guides.II. (9th October.)-The All-India Congress Committee considered the Sub-Committee^ draft instructions on non-co-operation&apos; reported last week, and have adopted them with the following modifications :  (A) They deleted the statement that the Congress had adopted. Gandhi&apos;s full, programme, including the withdrawal from civil and military service and the non-payment of taxes.(B) They have incorporated Patebs suggestions regarding the boycott of Govern-ment Councils... (C) They have deleted the Sub-Committee&apos;s interpolation of the word &quot; gradual &quot; in the Congress resolution, and advised a gradual withdrawal of pupils and a gradual suspense in practice by lawyers.(D) They adopted Iuoti Lai Nehrtts suggestions regarding the imposition of a social boycott on those unwilling to accept the decision of arbitration courts.(E) They deleted the statement that the boycott of foreign goods was an unfortunate interpolation.Arabindo Ghosh has refused the Presidentship of next Congress.2. Patel submitted proposals for the consideration of the All-India Congress Committee regarding the All-India Tilak memorial, consisting of a collection of 20 lakhs for the establishment of propaganda organizations in London, with a branch at Paris with Pandit Moti Lai Nehru at its head, and another at New York under Lala Lajpat Rai, the organizations to be named Tilak&apos;s Swaraj Publicity Board. At a meeting held on Saturday last the All-India Congress Committee resolved to start Tilalds memorial fund, to invite the provincial Congress Committees to collect sub-prescriptions, to ask the Tilak Memorial Sub-Committee to submit a further report in order to obtain the opinions of public and private committees, and finally to bring it for consideration before the next meeting.3. Reports from Provinces.-(A) Bombay. The Sub-Committee&apos;s report was generally received with disappointment, and probably the line of least resistance will be followed for the present, namely, a boycott of the Councils. The lead given by the 24 Nationalists who opposed this measure at the special Congress, but decided not to stand out of loyalty to the resolution, has been followed by 24 others who had little chance of election. Gandhi issued a manifesto to voters to sign a declaration that they did not wish to be represented till the Punjab and Caliphate wrongs had been righted and India had got swaraj. The branches of the India Home-rule League have been addressed with a view to concentrate on this for the next two months ; labour disputes, too, are likely to be utilized, and a strong lead in this direction is expected at the All-India Trade Union Congress in Bombay at the end of October. At the same time the moderates are organizing counter-propaganda. Jamnadas Dwarka Das resigned from the All-India Congress Committee owing to strong opposition to the principle and policy of non-co-operation.(B) Punjab. The Caliphate agitation has received a decided check owing to the collapse of the hijrat movement, but the extremist agitators are preaching non-co-operation, and some have openly declared that persons unwilling to surrender titles will be forced to do so. Sober-minded people are against it, but three of the Lahore leaders and all but two of the Amritsar candidates have withdrawn from candidature, and Sikh agitators are preaching non-co-operation, in villages. The arrest and prosecution of Zafar Ali is reported to have had a good effect. In regard to the dissemination of seditious matter among the troops, the reports indicate that
the chief grievance of the sepoy is insufficiency of pay. Lajpat Eai delivered an address in Lahore urging a boycott of the Councils and appealing for a vigorous and determined adoption of the non-co-operation programme.(C) Bengal. Political leaders have,shown little activity in the last fortnight, and are adjusting ideals to the new situation created by the acceptance of the Congress resolution. The recent elections for Union Boards aroused considerable interest and revealed no tendency for candidates to withdraw or voters to refrain from voting. At the same time the Caliphate Committee is organizing a determined campaign in support of non-co-operation in Calcutta, and is likely to concentrate on jute, management of labour, lascars, and servants of Europeans. The main eiforts are directed towards the districts. The Committee propose opening branches in important Mofussil centres and carrying on propaganda by means of delegates aided by the pressure of social and commercial ostracism. The Hindu leaders are afraid that it may lead to violence and are reluctant to face this. An association has been formed, consisting of most of the umemployed ex-detenus as members, to prevent friction between non-co-operators and their opponents with the object of persuading the latter to remain at any rate neutral.. Sir Ashutosh Chandhuri, J. ISf. Ray, J. Chandhuri and B. C. Chatterjee have issued an appeal to the public not to boycott the Councils, as the Congress resolution is not binding on the minority; they ask Indians to accept the new Government of India Act as a partial swaraj, which would lead to complete swaraj. The newspaper Bengali gives a useful lead against non-co-operation, and C. Mazumdar, ex-President of the Congress, has condemned the movement.(D) United Provinces. The political classes of educated Moslems discuss non-co-operation. Resignations so far are negligible. Non-co-operators will establish committees in every town and city, to further the movement and to bring pressure to bear by persuasion or threats on holders of titles and honorary offices. At the same time among the moderates, and especially among the more sensible Mohamedans, there are signs of a movement to organize themselves in opposition to the bullying of extremists. Ishwar Saran has condemned the movement on the ground that GandbFs appeal to the masses is dangerous and likely to release little dreamt of forces. The Agra riot reported in previous telegrams has been exaggerated by the Mohamedans of Delhi, who claim to have settled the trouble, whereas the dispute was settled by the Collector and the Delhi Mohamedans arrived after the riots were over. The Leader is publishing articles condemning non-co-operation and encouraging a possible revision of the resolution at the next Congress. Newspapers of various shades, including the Leader and the Independent, are calling for the return of Indian troops from Mesopotamia.(E) Bihar and Orissa. The postponement of Gandhi&apos;s promised visit to Bihar has caused temporary political stagnation. Few proselytes can (? be claimed) accordingly, but the Young Caliphate agitators are reported to be tired of their present leaders and complain that none of them carry out their promise to renounce titles and practice at the bar.(F) Delhi. The politicians are quiet. Doctor Ansari attempted to pass the non-co-operation resolution at the meeting of the Provincial Congress Committee, but only eight members out of 96 attended, and the matter was shelved. The demeanour of the crowds celebrating Muha,rram was orderly and good tempered.(G) North-West Frontier Province. Political agitation is temporarily at a discount. Seventy-five per cent, muhajarins have returned and are being settled. Local organizers of hijrat in Peshawar have judiciously kept in the background. Even so in Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan&apos;s handful! of mullahs persistently advocate emigration, but meet with a very meagre response.(H) Central Provinces. Extremists accepting the Congress decision have with-drawn their candidature; while condemning a boycott of the Councils they consider they are bound to accept the finding of the majority. In the north of the province, news of the adoption of the non-co-operation resolution was received without enthusiasm, boycott of the Councils and withdrawal of students from schools being regarded as inexpedient; and a new party is likely to spring up midway between the moderates and the extremists, and is calculated to weaken the Congress. In Berar lectures are given urging people not to vote at the elections and to abstain from calling on officials.4. Several prosecutions for political offences are being conducted under ordinary law : Swamy Vidyanand under section 131, Indian Penal Code, for attempting to seduce soldiers at Dinapore ; two maulvis under sections 124 and 153a, Indian Penal
Code, at Panipat, Punjab; Mr. Ishaq Ali, editor of -Al- Nazir at Lucknow, under sections 124a and 153b and 515, Indian Penal Code. The accused refuse to cross-examine, but are prepared to file a written statement.5. The Muharram festival passed off quietly everywhere with one or two small exceptions. Labour unrest continues. The Post and Telegraph employees at Bombay are still on strike. The men of the Bombay Gas Company went on a (&apos;? lightning) strike first and are still out. The Lucknow paper mills employees and the Calcutta tram men struck this week. The strike in the presses at Calcutta and Simla are over, and the oil-workers&apos; strike &apos;in Madras is settled. There has been serious trouble on the tea gardens in the Lakhimpur district of Assam.6. The publication of the Esher Committee report has evolved considerable criticism in the Indian Press, both moderate and extremist, on the ground that the recommendations impose an intolerable burden on India&apos;s finances, and create doubts whether it is really intended to endow India in the near future with full self-governing powers. The portions relating to the Indian territorial force are also adversely criticized.THE DOMINIONS.Bessarabian Treaty. On 9th October the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and the ,Officer Administering the Government of South Africa, that the Bessarabian Treaty was now nearly ready for signature. The final text had not yet been received from Paris, but according to the first draft which alone was available in London, the sovereignty of Rumania was recognized, over Bessarabia, and guarantees of liberty and justice ensured by Rumania to the inhabitants, The remaining articles were concerned mainly with questions relating to tbe future nationality of nationals of the former Russian Empire, habitually resident in Bessarabia, and with the assumption by Rumania of a proportional part, affecting Bessarabia, of the Russian public debt, and other Russian public liabilities.The Secretary of State asked to be informed whether &quot;the respective Ministers agreed to signature on their behalf.CANADA.Cable Service for Press News. -On 12th October the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Governor-General of Canada: -Referring to your despatch of 13th July, No. 469, Canadian News Service, it is understood that Mr. Roderick Jones, Reuter&apos;s, has been discussing with the Canadian Press, Limited, the possibility of sending a service of 30,000 words per month by Imperial cable to Canada at a special low rate.From enquiries made here, I find that the Post Office would undertake to carry such a service by the Imperial cable, but must charge the full Press rate of M. per word. The difference between this rate and any amount which the Canadian Press and ReuteFs would be prepared to contribute, would accordingly have to be made up either by the Canadian Government or from a special vote on the estimates here.If the Canadian Press does not object to this form of subvention, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, as a temporary measure for five months from 1st November, to contribute half the difference between the ordinary rate of 5d. and, say. Id. rate (which the Canadian Press would be required to pay), for a service of 30,000 words per month, provided that the Canadian Government would contribute the remaining half. The contribution involved on this basis whoulcl be 250Z. per month each by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Canadian Government. The suggested conditions of contribution are (a) that no sporting news or news not of national importance should be sent by special service; (b) that copies of all telegrams should be supplied by ReutePs to us, and by the Canadian Press to the Canadian Government; (c) that . the Canadian Press should undertake to transmit the whole of the special service to Western Canada. Please telegraph the views of the Canadian Government as soon as possible.
Miscellaneous.--The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs : -(1) Mr. Calder, Minister of Immigration and Colonization, who has just returned from.a tour in the British Isles, reports that there will be a large emigration to Canada within the next few years.(2) It is expected that the wheat crop of Alberta this year will have averaged a little over 22 bushels per acre.(3) Wheat is now arriving at the head of the Great Lakes at the rate of over a thousand carloads daily.(4) Canada&apos;s external trade during the 12 months ended 31st August included imports valued at $1,269,000,000 and exports amounting to $1,257,000,000. Imports from the United Kingdom during the 12 months,in question, reached $206,107,000 as compared with $76,690,000 for .the previous year. Exports of Canadian produce to the United Kingdom were worth $394,000,000 as against $575,697,000 for the-preceding 12 months.AUSTRALIA.League of Nations. On 2nd October the Governor-General telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies :-Please notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that Senator the Honourable Edward Davis Millen, Minister for Repatriation, has been selected as the representative of the Commonwealth of Australia at the Geneva meeting of the assembly of the League during November. Senator Millen, accompanied by two advisers and a secretary, leaves by the Orsova this week, arriving in London approximately 1st November; he will be available to attend any meeting of the British Empire delegation which may be held prior to the meeting of the League Assembly on 15th November as suggested in your telegram of 18th September. While in London, whither he will return after the conclusion of the Geneva meeting, Senator Millen will deal with finance and other questions previously entrusted to Mr. Watt, and will represent the Commonwealth at the Imperial Cabinet and in-all matters with which he may from time to time be required to deal.The New Governor-General. On 6th October Lord Forster reported that he had&apos; that clay assumed the administration of the Government of the Commonwealth.Admission of American-Germans. On 7th October the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Ministers would be glad if Consuls in the United States of America could be advised that the Government of the Commonwealth had decided that American citizens born there of German parents would be admitted into Australia if they were of sound health, good repute and held passports duly vised ; but that each case of Germans naturalized in America should, be submitted, mention being made of the period of residence in America, the purpose of the visit to Australia and its intended duration, of Australian references if any, and if recommended.   A similar decision applied to Austrians, Hungarians, Bulgarians.Copper [B.E.R., xxiv, p. 9]. On 6th October the Secretary, of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General as follows : Your telegram dated 6th August. Copper. The Minister of Munitions states that Wallaroo is not recognized as equally suitable with electrolytic for all purposes, even if for some it is more suitable, and is not good delivery against a contract for electrolytic. The market, therefore, is not so extensive, and the price during the war was 21., and is now If., less than for electrolytic. The Ministry of Munitions cannot limit the sales of Wallaroo to purchasers requiring it for the special purposes for which it has special advantages, but must dispose of stocks to the best advantage, having regard to reasonably prompt realization. Moreover, distribution to users previously unacquainted with Wallaroo should be to the ultimate advantage of Australian producers, ancl the Ministry considers that the value is not depreciated by disposing of surplus stocks at prices so nearly equivalent to electrolytic. If, however,, the producers are still dissatisfied, and desire to control the sale price in this country, it is open to them to make an offer for unsold stock to the Ministry, who would favourably consider a reasonable offer.The Minister adds that a clear distinction must he drawn between copper electrolytically produced, which is called electrolytic copper in this country, and fire 21-2 - O
refined,-, which, has never fetched the same price as electrolytic. The copper of the Australian Electrolytic Company was fire refined. \ v  -Apples [B.E.R., xxvii, p. ID].-In reply to the Governor-Generahs telegram of 20th September the Secretary of State sent the following message on 7th October .&apos;&quot; &quot; The Food Controller states that maximum prices will be reimposed on all apples,, whether home-grown or imported, after 15th November. Although some supplies of imported apples from America and elsewhere are at present being received, the larger proportion of imports from Canada and the United States will not arrive in the United Kingdom until after 15th November, and will be therefore subject to a maximum price equally with Australian apples. The home-grown crop has been, for practical purposes, a failure, and while the Food Controller is anxious that the price of imported apples should be such as to secure a reasonable return to the producer, he is obliged, in&apos;, the interests of the United Kingdom consumer, to take precautions in order to-obviate the price rising to scarcity value. The Food Controller adds, that although the piice of several varieties of imported apples was frequently lower last winter than the maximum price imposed, no complaints were received, and that the new schedule of prices provides for a substantial addition to the imported price of last year..y;&apos;.&apos;. NEW ZEALAND.Butter &quot;B.E.R., xxvii, p. 10]. Referring to the Food Controller^ message of. 27th September, the Governor-General of New Zealand telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on 9th October, as follows :  The Prime Minister met the Dominion Butter Committee on Gth October, and was informed (firstly) that the butter producers of South Island, and of the east and west &apos;C0.ast of North Island, accept the terms of purchase for creamery butter manufactured by them. (Secondly) but they request that a similar graduated increase, which it was understood was allowed to Australia, should be given for all butter of grading over 88 points, also that the free storage given by factories should be for six weeks, as arranged in Australia, instead of for two months as under existing arrangements in New Zealand. (Thirdly), they wish to be informed regarding the price for whey, dairy and milled butter, and suggest that the same reduction per pound from first grade creamery price as was existing last season should be continued. (Fourthly), the butter producers of certain districts bf the Auckland Province, who manufacture probably more, than half of the exportable surplus of New Zealand butter, decline to confirm the terms of purchase, unless a full guarantee is given that either a free market, in the United Kingdom will be given at 31st March 1921 or that New Zealand producers will at that time receive equal treatment with Irish and English producers. (Fifthly), the Prime Minister desires to be advised if butter may be accepted from thosb producers referred to in (firstly) who are willing to sell on the Imperial Govern-ment terms. (Sixthly) the Prime Minister desires to say that he is personally anxious that the available export should go to the Imperial Government, and on this account, as well as for other reasons, he hopes that the suggestion made by the producers may be agreed to. (Seventhly), Mr. Massey desired to add that the new seasohs butter is now coming in freely.F- SOUTH AFRICA,The Reunion Congress. - ReuteFs agent reported from Bloemfontein on 24th September that the Hereeniging Conference, which was being held to consider the possibility of the reunion of the Dutch inhabitants of South Africa, had been faced with a clean-cut issue at its sitting that clay. The Nationalists had insisted on the Republican ideal in its programme of reunion, while the South African party stood for a reunion in which the whole British people of South Africa could unhesitatingly join with their Dutch brothers. The chairman was, therefore, compelled to report that a deadlock had been reached, and the congress concluded without reaching an agreement.. -General Smuts&apos; Appeal &apos;for the Formation of a Great Moderate Party. ReuteFs Capetown agent telegraphed as follows on 29th September :--&quot;The Prime Minister, General Smuts, will make the momentous announcement to-night that, &quot; following upon the recent Bloemfontein Congress, the time seems to
&quot; have arrived for the formation of a great Moderate Party of South Africans of both &quot; races in the support of the Union Constitution, which will declare itself against &quot; revolution, the violation of the constitution, or lawlessness in. any shape or form.&apos;&apos;The Prime Minister, in a letter to the South African party, refers to a party congress on 27th October at Bloemfontein, to be held in consequence of what happened at the recent Hereeniging or Reunion Congress.General Smuts says : The Hereeniging Congress marks a great turning point in . our political development, from which important results for our future will follow. After repeated and earnest attempts at the reunion of the South African and Nationalist parties it has at last become evident that such a reunion is impossible. .The Nationalist party has, through its spokesmen, declared most clearly that active propaganda for secession from the British Commonwealth must form an integral part of any political programme to which it could subscribe. The South African party regards such, a policy as a wrong and dangerous one for our young country and people to follow, as a violation of our constitution, as a breach of good faith, and of the understanding whereby both European races came together to found a united South Africa, and as an effective means to force the future policy of South Africa on racial lines.The South African party would be false to her past and would seriously endanger the great constructive work of the last 12 years if she were to embrace such a policy. It was hoped that the National party, for the sake of national unity, would have been willing to waive its secession policy, but this hope has now been proved to be in vain, and thus has reunion become impossible. Under these circumstances, another way out of the present political difficulties must be sought. For some considerable time the South African party has had the choice between reunion and expansion, and now that reunion has been negatived the other alternative of expansion is left, but a decision in connexion therewith must be submitted to a party congress. Now that the Nationalist party is firmly resolved to continue its propaganda of fanning the fires of secession and of driving the European races apart from each other and ultimately into conflict with each other, the moderate elements of our population have no alternative but to draw closer to one another in order to fight that policy.A new appeal must, therefore, be made to all right-minded South Africans, irrespective of party or race, to join the new party which will be strong enough to safeguard the permanent interests of the Union against the disruptive and destructive policy of the Nationalists. Such a central political party will not only continue our great work of the past, but it is destined to play a weighty role in the future peaceable development of South Africa. The recent great improvement in our status and position must for the future be consolidated by peaceable means. The internal development and strengthening of South Africa must be promoted by the one and only method, and that is by co-operation in every respect between both European races.Telegraphing again on the following day ReuteFs agent said that vivid interest had been awakened in political circles as to events in the immediate future.The Unionists had greeted the premier&apos;s manifesto with undoubted enthusiasm, which had been heightened by their admiration of the manner in which the South African party delegates had stood by their principles at the recent Hereeniging Congress in Bloemfontein.Prominent Unionists considered that their party would be willing, as a compliment to their allies, to accept the name &quot; South African Party&quot; for any new united party that might be decided upon.And on 2nd October he reported that Sir Thomas Smartt, welcoming General Smuts&apos; proposal for the regrouping of the various Parliamentary parties on new lines, had said : &quot; I feel certain I have the full support of the Unionist party in doing all I can to assist in the formation of a new party such as General Smuts suggests.&quot;In regard to the attitude of the Press, he telegraphed on 30th September that the Gape Times had remarked that the regrouping could only be made possible by splendid fidelity to the constitution, the repudiation of race cleavage and firm adherence to the principles established at the Union and maintained by the South African Party delegates at Bloemfontein. The Times suggests that Unionists should hold a congress at Bloemfontein at the same time, as the forthcoming South African Party Congress there, when a simultaneous resolution of both parties to dissolve might be a preliminary step to the immediate establishment of a new Central Party, Jor which the most appropriate name would be &quot; the South African Party.&quot;
NEWFOUNDLAND.Wireless Communications-On 12th. October the Governor of Newfoundland-informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Ministers had entered into an agreement&apos;with the Marconi Company, Canada, extending the monopoly of wireless communication, to Newfoundland on the lines of the present contracts, with the right to erect large stations on the Avalon Peninsula, and at Grandfalls. He asked if this conflicted with any general rights of the Admiralty at Mountpearl, or the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
