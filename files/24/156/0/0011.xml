FIJI.Indian Labourers&apos; Strike [B.E.R., x., p. 2]. The Secretary of State for the&quot; Colonies received the following telegram from the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific on 13th February : The first serious collision occurred in the Indian quarter at Suva on 11 th February, when a mob of strikers, who were lying in wait for. loyal workers, attacked the police and badly injured three European special constables. Order was at once restored and numerous arrests were made. On. 12th February a disturbance broke out amounting to a riot, but the police and defence force showed admirable restraint under extreme provocation, and the crowd dispersed without the necessity of resorting to extreme measures. Steps are being-taken to control the movements of Indians in Suva and the neighbourhood, and to afford protection to those desiring to return to work. There is as yet no news as to whether the agitators have succeeded in extending the strike to the north coast and the west coast, of Main Island, or whether the recent offer of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to Indian cane growers and workers is likely to be accepted.A further telegram, dated 14th February 1920, gives the following information :  The Commission appointed by the Governor to inquire into the cost of living and the rate of wages, was adjourned on 10th February in order to await the arrival of the Honourable Badri Mahraj, Member of Legislative Council, who was unable to arrive in time for the first sittings. Some useful evidence has been taken already. Meanwhile, Mr.. S. Chowla, who was nominated by the strike leaders as additional Indian Member of the Commission, has issued the following appeal :-&quot; I appeal to my countrymen to resume work on or before Monday next. The Commission is sitting, and a hope is expressed that good results will follow from its deliberations. I have seen many of your leaders and they agree with me that you should take the course I am suggesting. Failing-acceptance of my advice and returning to work on Monday, I shah feel that I shall have to consider whether I should resign ray position as your representative on the Commission.&quot;Telegraphing again on 17th February, Mr. Rodwell reported that considerable numbers had returned to work, and that the only affray since the two already reported occurred on 14th February, when the police had to disperse a crowd which had been damaging bridges. There was, he added, no development in. regard to the northern and western districts.EGYPT.The Egyptian Control Cotton Scheme. On 5th February Lord Curzon issued a Memorandum on this subject in which he discusses the arguments which have been severally adduced by the President of the Board of Trade and by the Foreign Office in support of Lord Allenby&apos;s contentions, regarding the allocation of profits arising out of the Egyptian Cotton Control Scheme. Lord Curzon is of opinion that on grounds of political expediency it would be wiser for His Majesty&apos;s Government to waive their claim to a share of half the profits, which he describes as a &quot; financial windfall,&quot; whereby no charge would be involved on the Treasury. From reports of the Liverpool Cotton Market, in which the sale of controlled Egyptian cotton is compared with the relative price of American cotton, he draws the conclusion that the profits were in fact earned at the expense of the Egyptian growers. He questions whether the undoubtedly great services of the Egyptian Official Values Committee were really more valuable than those rendered by the skilled classifiers of the Control Board in Egypt throughout the period of control. Finally, Lord Curzon, alluding to the grave consequences which would inevitably follow a strict enforcement of the rights of His Majesty&apos;s Government, records his disinclination to over-rule the views of Lord Allenby, which have been strongly and more than once expressed.SUDAN.Status of the Sudan.-Telegraphing [No. .119] on 15th February, Sir Milne Cheetham transmitted a message from the High Commissioner, from Khartum, on.
the status of&apos; the Sudan. Lord Allenby said that he had been much struck by the way all classes of the native population displayed their enthusiasm for Great Britain, and by their unconcealed expression of preference for British rather than Egyptian administration. He had no doubt that the opinion of the thinking populace of the country had been truly expressed by the delegation who visited England last year. The lead in this opinion was being taken by the principal religious chiefs and the heads of tribes, who had given proofs of disassociating themselves from Egyptian aspirations during the recent troubles in Egypt. Lord Allenby was convinced, from his personal observation, that the confidence and respect for their present rulers which was expressed by the religious chiefs were sincere, and were the outcome of real gratitude for the peace and prosperity which had been brought to the Sudan by Great Britain. While the same thing applied to the heads of tribes, Lord Allenby pointed out that many of these were old men, and that with their disappearance their influence would be removed. They would be succeeded by young men without the same experience, whose modern education would make them more receptive and susceptible to nationalist and revolutionary ideas.On this account Lord Allenby considered that this was an opportune moment to settle definitely the status of the Sudan and its relation to the British Empire. He was in favour of maintaining the present policy of the Sudan Government, which was to encourage the growth among the Sudanese of the idea of the Sudan as a nation. From this he hoped to see the gradual development of a typical constitution which would meet the needs of the country.For a proper definition of the status of the Sudan, he considered the following-points were essential: An agreement between Great Britain and Egypt under which the former would guarantee the security of Ggypt&apos;s water supply and of the Sudanese frontier, conditional on Great Britain being left entirely the internal control of the Sudan; the separation of the office of the Governor-General of the Sudan from that of the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army.INDIA.The Viceroy&apos;s Reports. The following report was sent on 29th January :  The extremist Press continues its violent attacks on General Dyer and Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer. Pictures are published of public flogging and of piquets enforcing the crawling order in Amritsar, and cartoons are reproduced from the Star and the Daily Herald. The general tone is represented by such head-lines &quot;as &quot;Hunter Committee will not satisfy,&quot; &quot; Bring Dyer to court-martial.&quot; It is reported that Harkishen Lai is going to England at once to institute proceedings against 0&apos;Dwyer. There are continued suggestions for the recall of the Viceroy, and the Secretary of State has not escaped attack.2. Mohamedan feeling is increasingly exercised over the Turkish peace terms. The Viceroy&apos;s reply to the Mohamedan deputation is being given widespread publicity, and has been favourably received by many sections of the Press, including the English and Indian papers. The subsequent statement issued by the Caliphate deputation characterizes the reply as perfectly courteous but equally disappointing, and adds that the loyalty of Mohamedans will be exposed to an undue strain should the peace terms be unfavourable to the Mohamedan religion and sentiment, and that the assurance of loyalty expected by the A^iceroy cannot be given. Five members of the deputation are sailing for England on 1st&apos; February by the S.S. Trustino. It is understood that, there was some difficulty experienced in securing the necessaiy funds. Until the release of the Ali brothers very little money had been subscribed by Mohamedans to support the agitation regarding the Caliphate and the future of Turkey. The demonstrations of 17th October were practically financed by one man, and the funds contributed from India to the London centre of the movement amount to under 1,0002. sterling, and were contributed by three or four individuals. The president of the All-India Caliphate Committee has now asked the 72 Caliphate Committees in India to curtail expenditure with a view to the utilization of savings for the deputation.3. An interesting movement is reported from Bombay. Baptista, anxious to form a Democratic Party, and Tilak have launched a National Democratic Company with aA 2
capital of 10 lakhs, having for its objects (1) to demand self-determination for India ; (2) to bring India socially in line with the civilized nations of the world; and (3) to support the just rights of workers and to bring about an equitable division of wealth.4. The strike situation in Bombay has been marked by a growing tendency to acts of sabotage. A Labour Settlement Committee has been formed, under the presidency of Sir N. Chandravarkar and the vice-presidency of Baptista, to ascertain the &apos;men&apos;s grievances and to elect delegates to work between the Committee and,,the authorities and in any negotiations with owners. It adopted the simple expedient of reading out a long list of demands, which in some cases the men themselves modified. The men&apos;s delegates are for concentrating on the essentials increased wages, monthly bonus, and strike pay. The mill-owners at first refused to consider the proposals till the men had returned to work, but the subsequent intervention of the Governor of Bombay led to negotiations between the Mill-Owners&apos; Association and the Settlement Committee, the result of which was that a settlement was arranged and notices posted at all mill doors explaining the terms, including the extra allowances of 55 per cent., instead of a previous 35, to the fixed pay of the workers and the adoption of a 10 hours day from 1st February. On the early morning of the 24th, the mills blew the whistle announcing that the gates were open, but great disappointment was caused by the failure of the men to respond ; the result being an apparent dead-lock. The strike in the Jamalpur workshops is over, the men having returned to work unconditionally. The jute mills strike in Bengal has also been settled; but the railway strike in Saharunpur continues, and many rumours of strikes are heard from other areas in the United Provinces.5. Mrs. Besant, writing in New India, has unreservedly welcomed the reforms and the Royal Proclamation. The Moderate Press in Bombay strongly condemned, the tone of the Congress speeches on the subject of the reforms. Pandit Malaviya, in a public address at Allahabad, has been pressing the attention of the country on the new situation created by the Reforms Act. Whatever individual opinion regarding the adequacy of the reforms may be, it is expected that interest will quicken every-where when the work of preparing the electoral rolls is taken up.On 4th February the Viceroy telegraphed again, saying : The political situation has been quieter during the last week, though Punjab reports that the extremist politicians are striving to arouse interest in political agitation among the masses. Money is being collected for the Jallianwala Bagh memorial; and to the demands for the recall of the Viceroy and the impeachment of Sir Michael OThvyer is now added in certain violent organs of the Press the cry &quot;Montagu must go.&quot; The released martial law convicts attribute their release to pressure brought to bear by agitation, and profess innocence of the offences for which they were convicted. The Local Government is attacked for interpreting the amnesty in a grudging spirit, though of 1,779 persons originally convicted for the disturbances only 97 still remain in confinement.2. The appeal of the Katarpur riot convicts for mercy is causing some stir. The Mohamedans of Amritsar held a meeting under the presidency of Dr. Kitchlew to urge clemency, but the general feeling of the Mohameclans present was not wholly sympathetic, nor is the proposal to abandon the sacrifice of cows welcomed amongst the rank and file of the 4^unjab Mohamedans. Three members of the Caliphate deputation sailed on 1st February for Marseilles.3. The Indian Press is devoting considerable attention to Bolshevism. The apprehension of Bolshevik designs on India and Asia is stimulating popular interest, but it is clear that abuse of Bolshevism and description of its horrors will have to be followed up by more reasoned criticism of its doctrines, with explanations of its success and of the difference between the theory and the practice of its exponents.4. Seventy-five mills in Bombay resumed work yesterday, many at full strength. The prospects of the strike ceasing completely are,now reported to be favourable.Two days later the Viceroy reported that all the mills were then working with an. average strength of 75 per cent., and that all was quiet.The Caliphate Deputation. On 19th January the Viceroy telegraphed the following full summary of the address which was to be presented to him by the Caliphate deputation, including, amongst others, the following persons of note:  Shaukat Ali, lately released and elected President, Caliphate Congress, Amritsar; his.
brother, Mahumad Ali Ajtnal Khan, President, All-India Moslem League, Amritsar Dr. Ansari Abdul Bari, Lucknow; Seth M. M. Ohotaui, Bombay; Abdul Kalam Azad, lately released; Dr. Kitchlew and Rambuujdat Chaudhri, lately released ; Gandhi Swami Shraddanand Has rat Mohani: 1. The Caliphate Conference (? press for) deputation to England to lay before His Majesty and Ministers a clear statement of the obligations imposed on every Moslem by his faith and the united wishes of the Indian Moslems regarding the Caliphate, Moslem control of whole Jazirat-ul-Arab, the Caliph&apos;s wardenship of the Holy Places and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. This is a necessity, enhanced by. the present grave situation, fast developing into an unmistakable menace.2. After the horrors and bloodshed of war, a lasting peace was expected at the earliest possible moment, but great delay has occurred in regard to Turkey and Asia, now on the verge of a storm which must affect the Moslem world.3. At this, the statesmen of the Empire must, in concluding a settlement, take into full account the binding religious obligations and cherished  sentiments of i   70 millions Indian Moslems and the sympathies of 250 millions Hindu compatriots.4.- During war-time these sympathies were not expressed with sufficient force, and it is regretted even more that religious obligations were not emphasized to the ruling class of the alien faith. (?) discuss reason for this omission, but since the armistice a clearer exposition of the doctrines essential to the salvation of Moslems has been made.5. Recognizes the increasing appreciation of the deep Moslem concern in the Turkish settlement, and thankfully acknowledges the repeated representations made by Government of India and Secretary of State for India on their behalf to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but the latter is too far removed for Indian Moslems to influence its opinions or pre-conceived ideas appreciably, and British Ministers seem from their utterances disposed to consider British and Christian aspects only in making a settlement.6. In these circumstances, one final effort is necessary to warn the Imperial authorities of the danger of a settlement forced on Moslems contrary to the clearest commandments of their creed, and to entreat His Majesty&apos;s Government to avoid the evil consequences of such a decision.7. A deputation to England is the only effective method of placing directly before His Majesty and his Ministers and, it is hoped also, the Allied and associated nations, humble but frank submissions of the binding force of Islamic obligations and the scope for Moslem aspiration.8. Recalls the conditions of peace laid down by the President of the United States, and accepted by&apos;the Caliph, and the pledge of the British Premier regarding Constantinople, Thrace, and Turkish homelands. If these pledges be unredeemed or whittled down, thehnoral prestige of the Empire will be undermined&quot;to an extent for which no territorial or political gains will compensate. Reference is also made in the same connexion to the pledges proclaimed by Lord Hardinge.9. Apart from the possible non-redemption of such pledges, the Moslems of India are the most deeply concerned, because a settlement is apparently being outlined which no Moslem could accept without jeopardizing his eternal salvation.10. Temporal power is the very essence of the Caliphate, and Moslems can never agree to any change in its character or to the dismemberment of its Empire.11. No kind of non-Moslem control of the Jazirat-ul-Arab can be tolerated by the Islamic faith.12. The Caliph alone can be warden of the Holy Places.13. The action of the Moslems of Arabia in infringing the integrity of the -Caliph&apos;s dominions is condemned by the rest of the Moslem world. It is the duty of Indian Moslems to remove the cause of difference between the Arabs and other Moslems.14. Ali Moslems are interested in seeing that the principles of self-determination are applied to Moslems equally with Christians, and to Asiatics equally with Europeans.15. In spite of charges to the contrary, based on prejudice and on bitterness of recent growth, the verdict of history will vindicate alike the basic toleration of Islam and the essential humanity of the Turks.16. The loyalty of Indian Moslems, which has been an asset of British rule, is mainly based on the preservation of their religious freedom. Justice and expediency alike demand that no change shall, be made in what is unalterable and has been unaltered for 13 centuries of Islam, though changes may be possible in what is -changeable, under wdiich latter head Moslem sentiment may be sacrificed to ImperialA 3
Tequirements, though such sentiments should he considered. The requirements of Islamic law are, however, so binding that they cannot be reduced by a hair&apos;s breadth to.suit the desire of the Allied Powers!17. But Indian Moslems take their stand also on Imperial interests, which necessitate that the settlement should be acceptable alike to the Moslems and the non-Moslems of India, now happily re-united. The Imperial authorities should not under-rate the value of Islamic friendship and Indian loyalty. A settlement not acceptable to India would bring no peace, and every Moslem would know no rest and could only aspire to salvation by following the dictates of Islam, however painful their consequences.18. A just appreciation of Islamic obligations and Moslem sentiments in this matter, coupled with a generous recognition of India&apos;s fitness&quot; for responsible local self-government, will, on the contrary, add immensely to the power of the British Empire, and make the world safe, not only (      ?      ), also for God and truth.19. Once the success of our mission is assured, it will be our business to reassure distracted Moslems and to promote the peace of the whole world.On the following day the Viceroy telegraphed this summary of his reply to the deputation : I. welcomed the opportunity of hearing their views on the sitbject of the Turkish peace terms, and also of explaining to Indian Mohammedans the attitude of the Government of India, the efforts made by them and the Secretary of State to secure the adequate representation of Indian Moslem feeling before the Peace Conference,, and our genuine sympathy with them in its present difficult position. I explained that we had no secret information regarding the probable nature of the decision, and we warned them not to place reliance on cabled newspaper reports, which in no sense represented the opinions of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers. The Secretary of State is now in Paris with the Prime Minister, pressing the views of Indian Moslems with his accustomed energy and force, and a decision may come at any moment. No effort has-been spared to place before those with whom the decision will rest the plea of Indian Mohammedans for the most favourable possible treatment of Turkey. I repeated extracts from my Council speech of 3rd September at Simla on the same subject, and drew attention to the Secretary of State&apos;s recent utterance in a Press interview to the same effect. I thanked them for their acknowledgment of these efforts. I proceeded to explain the efforts made in further detail, saying that the representation was made soon after the armistice, that Indian Moslems feel much disturbed over the Turkish peace terms, partially with regard to the holy places in Bejaz and Koweit, and of Constantinople, and therefore necessary to secure a full statement of their views before the Peace Conference. An Indian Delegation composed of the Secretary of State, Bikaner, and Lord Sinha pressed the case for a favourable treatment of Turkey with unsurpassable earnestness of purpose and force and argument. The Delegation had the assistance of the memorial of 1st January signed by prominent Mohammedans, including Aga Khan, Ameer Ali, Sir Abbas Ali Baig, and Yusuf Ali, and at the hearing before the Conference were accompanied by Aga Khan, Sahibzada Aftab Ahmed Khan, and Yusuf Ali. The same month we again urged the importance of considering the effect of the settlement on Indian Moslems&apos; opinion. I have been in unceasing communication privately since with the Secretary of State, whose views coincide closely with my own. The matter, however, is not one&apos; for the British Cabinet only but for the other great Powers involved. The decision of Turkey to join the enemy undoubtedly prolonged the war and increased its -grievous misery. I trust that the tribunal of the Allied Powers will now pronounce judgement. Turning next to the terms of the address I repeated my sincere sympathy with their troubles and difficulties.. I could not admit the validity of all their contentions, but no advantage would be gained by an argumentative examination of the memorial by paragraphs.I recognized that the Moslems of India felt very deeply on the subject, and the occasion was not one.for unprofitable controversy but for helpful co-operation..I promised to do whatever was possible to help them in sending the mission, but as the decision may come at any moment I have already cabled a full summary of the memorial to the Secretary of State, as this may strengthen his hands. I expressed my profound confidence that whatever may be the decision, the Mohammedans of India will remain staunch in allegiance and loyalty to the King-Emperor. In the great war they made generous and whole-hearted response to the call of Empire. Their loyalty and assistance has.been of. the greatest value, and thousands of Moslem
-soldiers gave, their lives-gallantly for India and the Crown in many theatres of war. Now that victory is won I am confident that the Indian Moslems will not waver in. their attitude of steadfast loyalty to His Majesty.I reaffirmed the previous declaration on the question of the Caliphate as a matter for Mohammedans only to decide. But the contention that Turkey should (? keep) the full . integrity.of its pre-war sovereignty and dominions could not reasonably be expected to be recognized. Before the Avar His Majesty&apos;s Government offered to guarantee such integrity, but after defeat Turkey could not expect, any more than other enemy Powers, wholly to escape the consequences of her action.I fully realized this must be matter of grief to Indian Moslems and ended as follows : I would, however, ask them to take a practical view and a long view of the situation (corrupt group) letting them remember that when this unhappy war broke out it was unmistakably the wish of every Briton to maintain the old ties of friendship which bound together the British Empire and the Turkish Empire. We could so well have trod tegether the same path and have emerged victorious from the struggle side by side. Unhappily those in whose hands the destinies of Turkey rested at that supreme moment chose to join our enemies. That action and its consequences have created the difficult problems which now confront, us. But as you rightly indicate in your address there is a community of interests and a long tradition of friendship between the British and Turkish Empires. I look forward, therefore, to a time when our old relations with the Turkish Empire will be re-established and restored on a basis of mutual advantage and mutual goodwill. Do not let your minds be too much overclouded by the.passing shadows of to-day, when the whole world is in a state of flnx and every one of us, of whatever class, nation, or creed, feels buffeted and torn by events it has been our lot to pass through. Take a long view. (Corrupt group) good, will and must survive.Meanwhile, from the deadly struggle in which world has been engaged, the British Empire has emerged as strong as ever. (? Within that perfectly) His Majesty&apos;s Government, the religion and the lives and property of Moslems have been secured. Within it and beyond it there will still be an assured future for Islam and peace and prosperity, as in the past, for all Moslems.The future of India is now bright with promise. We are on the eve of a great experiment which, if wisely guided, will give India a high place among the countries of the world. For its success and for the ordered progress of this great country, enabling it to withstand the dangerous menace of social and political disorder now overshadowing the East, the fullest co-operation of Moslem India is essential.Offering you my sympathy and my help in the trouble that has brought you here to-day, I require your aid and co-operation in the great task which now calls for our united energies.On 28th January the Viceroy telegraphed the following rejoinder of the Caliphate deputation to his reply of the 20th instant: &quot; The Viceroy&apos;s reply, whilst perfectly courteous, was equally disappointing in that His Excellency said in emphatic language that Turkey, when she had her choice, deliberately drew her sword against the Allied Powers, and must take the con-sequences. We consider this means punishment for Turkey for having joined the Central Powers contrary to the solemn declaration made by Mr. Asquith, then Prime Minister, after Turkey had so made her choice. His Excellency hoped that whatever the decision, Indian Moslems&apos; loyalty would remain as staunch as ever. We desire to place on record our firm conviction that should the peace terms result unfavourably to Moslem religion and sentiments, they would place an undue strain upon Moslem loyalty, and knowing, as we do, the universal feeling in India as men with a full sense of responsibility, it is not possible for us to give the assurance His Excellency expected [?] It is due to the Peace Conference now sitting, to ourselves and to the Empire, to which we desire to remain loyal, to state in. explicit language the minimum that will satisfy Moslem sentiments. Arabia, delimited by Moslem authorities, and the holy places of Islam must remain under the control of the Caliph, full guarantee being taken, consistent with the dignity of a sovereign -State, for genuine Arabian self-government, should the Arabs desire it. We advisedly use word genuine because the present arrangement is thoroughly distrusted by the overwhelming majority of intelligent Moslem opinion. Islam has ever associated temporal power with the Caliphate.   We therefore consider that to make the Sultan
n mere puppet would add insult to injury, and would only be understood by Indian Moslems as an affront given them by a combination of Christian Powers. Whilst, therefore, we must insist on the pledge given by Mr. Lloyd George on 5th January 1918 being fulfilled in order to show that we desire no more than the strictest justice, we concede the right of the Allied Powers to ask for such guarantees as may be considered necessary for the full protection of non-Moslem races living.under the Sultan. We hope even at this eleventh hour that British Ministers will give due weight to, and appreciate Moslem sentiment in India, supported as it is by practically the whole of enlightened Hindu opinion. His Excellency has stated that it is just possible peace terms may be completed and declared within a few days, and we can only hope that it is not yet too late to mend what mistake may have been committed. We claim that the British Imperial Government is as much a trustee for Moslem and Indian interests as for Christian. Therefore it is not enough that our sentiment and wishes are placed before League, but essential that British Ministers should make our case their own.&quot;The Imperial Legislative Council. On 2nd February the Viceroy reported that the following resolution was adopted unanimously at the opening meeting of the Imperial Legislative Council on 1st February : &quot; That this Council begs leave to tender to His Majesty the King-Emperor of India its dutiful homage and loyal devotion, and to express its sense of profound gratefulness for the Royal Proclamation issued by His Majesty on the memorable occasion of his having given his Royal assent to the Govern-ment of India Bill, declaring as the Proclamation does the noble and lofty principles of government which in the future are to guide the policy of His Majesty V officers to enable the Indian nation to attain full responsible government and full political freedom as an equal member of British Commonwealth.&quot;The Viceroy went on to say that the proceedings were marked with great enthusiasm and unanimity. The mover, Mr. Sachchidananda Sinha, who belongs to the advanced political party, gave utterance to sentiments of unexceptional nature; he laid stress on the binding force of the Royal Proclamation, and explained that he had purposely omitted any reference to what he considered ephemeral or transitory portions of the Proclamation, such as the message of Royal clemency, and even the Government of India Act, in regard to the adequacy of which different opinions might be held. He preferred to emphasize those portions which were of permanent value, namely, the recognition of the goal of responsible government, and the ultimate position of India in the British Commonwealth. Snrendra Nath Banerji followed with a really eloquent speech, which was much applauded ; he supported the resolution enthusiastically, but regretted that the mover.had omitted from it any mention of the Royal clemency, which he regarded as of permanent value in its creation of a favourable atmosphere for the work of co-operation, also the recognition of the Reforms Act as a material advance on the road to responsible government, and a reference to the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, to whom the whole of India would extend a most enthusiastic and loyal welcome ; he appealed to the non-official European community for whole-hearted co-operation in the common task, and concluded with a tribute to Lord Chelmsford&apos;s personal labours in connexion with the reforms. Messrs. Crum and Nigel Paton, representing the Calcutta and Bombay commercial communities, in response to the invitation, promised the most cordial co-operation of non-official Europeans in making a success of the scheme, now that it had received the acceptance of Parliament and the assent of His Majesty the King. Mr. Sharma, in supporting the resolutions, laid special stress on the debt which India owed to Lord Chelmsford. Dr. Saprn said that the mover had rightly emphasized the permanently valuable portions of the Proclamation, and the peculiar sanctity for Indians of their :Sovereign&apos;s plighted-word. He regarded the declaration of 1917, the Reforms Act, and the Royal Proclamation with great satisfaction as bringing India nearer the promised land. Practical problems of administration would present great difficulties to Indians, but they were encouraged by the examples of Gokhale, Lord Sinha, and others, and greatly appreciated ike offers of good fellowship made by Messrs. Crum and Paton. An honest exchange of views would lead to a mutual understanding. A large number of other Indian non-officials cordially supported the resolution. Sir William Marris, accepting the resolution on behalf of the Government, said every official was in accord with Mr. Banerji&apos;s appeal for co-operation and the prompt response of non-official Europeans was of happy augury ; he -referred to the Viceroy&apos;s
labours on behalf of the reforms, and rejoiced that so many members recognized them. The mover expressed his gratification at the reception of the resolutions, and explained that though he had omitted all reference to these subjects in the resolutions he fully appreciated the value of the amnesty, shared with all Indians the delighted anticipation of the visit of the Prince of Wales and yielded to none in gratitude to the Viceroy for his labours on behalf of India and the reforms. Reuters telegrams will have given you accounts of the impressive ceremony before the Council meeting Avhen the Viceroy formally received the shield and Union Jack presented to the Indian Army by the women and children of the British Isles, and will also have placed you in possession of a summary of the Viceroy&apos;s speech at the opening of the Council.THE DOMINIONS.International Labour Conference. The following telegram was 4sent on -5th February by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa :  Please communicate the following to your Government: The Governing Body of the International Labour Office has fixed a special meeting of the International Labour Conference to consider seamen&apos;s questions, to take place at Genoa 15th June next.   The agenda is as follows : (1) Application to seamen of the Washington Convention limiting working hours to 8 per day and 48 per week. Consequential effects on manning and on regulations governing accommodation and health on board. (2) Supervision of articles of agreement. Facilities for finding seamen employ-ment. Application to seamen of the Washington Convention and recommendations concerning unemployment and unemployment insurance. (3) Application to seamen of the Washington Convention prohibiting children&apos;semployment under 14 years.. (4) Consideration of possibility of drawdng up an international seamen&apos;s code. The Conference will meet under conditions specified by Article 389, &amp;c, Peace Treaty, governing General Conferences, Non-Government delegates and advisers should therefore be chosen as for the Washington Conference in agreement with the most representative industrial organizations, but as the agenda will be limited to seamen&apos;s questions they should probably include persons familiar with maritime affairs and commanding the confidence of shipowners and&apos; seamen.As some Governments may not wish to participate in the Conference because their countries are not sufficiently interested in maritime questions, a telegraphic reply is requested by&apos;31st March in order that arrangements may be made at Genoa.CANADA.Effect of High Bate of Exchange. The High Commissioner received information on 11th February that the leading merchants and manufacturers at Montreal stated that the high rate of exchange between Canada and the United States was diverting to the United Kingdom a great amount of business which formerly went south. The imports from the United States were confined to goods.which Canada cannot do &quot;without or cannot obtain in Great Britain. .Scheme for Settlers-The High Commissioner was also informed that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was organizing a scheme for bringing to Alberta several thousands of settlers from Holland, Scandinavia, Belgium, and the United States.The Industrial Situation. - According to reports received by the High Commis-sioner on 11th February, unemployment in the Dominion is not nearly so bad as had been expected, and&apos;the industrial situation of Canada compares favourably with that 10-3 B
of any country in the world. The Canadian Minister of Labour has made a statement to that effect. The number of calls on the emergency fund for Canadian returned soldiers is steadily decreasing, as unemployment is being kept at a minimum throughout the Dominion, and a remarkable absence of labour trouble is shown by the Department of Labour. There is a serious shortage of female help, in view of which the United Boards of Trade of Western Ontario have been discussing proposals to encourage the immigration of young women from Great Britain.AUSTRALIA.Dairy Produce [B.E.R., x., p. 7]. On 6th February the Governor-General of Australia telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies with reference to his telegram of 29th January. Sir R. Munro Ferguson said that in regard to butter his Prime Minister had advised him that it would take some time to consult the producers, but he thought that the only possible terms of sale would be for the price to be that at which His Majesty&apos;s Government sold butter, less expenses, with full liberty to supply any market offering business. The producers had had a disastrous season, and were strongly resenting being unable to ship butter to America and Africa at the prices offered, which were considerably above those of the existing contract with Britain. He understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government was selling butter, shipped from Australia, at a considerable profit, and would, highly appreciate any action His Majesty&apos;s Government might take to review the price during the balance of the contract period. He would be glad to receive an early reply as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would entertain a proposal of an increase in price for the existing contract period, and whether negotiations for next season&apos;s butter could be conducted on the basis suggested.IFooZ. On 6th February the Secretary of State for the Colonies received a telegram from the Governor-General of Australia, transmitting a message from his Prime Minister to the following effect: :Very widespread interest has been aroused by Press reports of enquiries by the Commission in. Britain disclosing the extent of profits on Australian wool sold in Britain and the expiration of the contract on 30th June, and Government will be expected to inform the new Parliament, which opens in three weeks, of full details. In view of this I shall be glad if you will be good enough to supply me with the fullest information, and in particular as to (1) the quantity of Australian wool sold, to date and used for civilian purposes ; (2) the average price received ; (3) the quantity and prices of wool (a) sold by auction, (b) sold at issue price; (4) the value of Bradford wool tops on the dates on which wool was released at issue prices, giving difference in value between the actual and the issue price for raw wool; (5) the issue prices for the 450,000 bales which the Government understands were sold at issue prices ; (6) total amount (a) received by the British Government for Australian wool used (i) for the Army, and (ii) for civilian purposes ; and (b) the amount due to the Australian growers as half share of all civilian wool sold to date ; (7) the amount of wool unsold to date ; (8) the current price of tops in Bradford ; (9) the date on which the money due to Australia will be paid. The Government wishes stronglj&apos; to protest against the delay in payment and to point out that all money due to Australia to date ought to be paid forthwith. Further, that all profits on the half share of wool sold hereafter should be paid as and when sales are made, and that interest shall be paid to Australia on all money due to Australian growers on wool already sold fur civilian purposes, calculated from the date of sale or issue on every parcel of wool sold for or used for civilian purposes from the beginning of the contract to the termination thereof.NEW ZEALAND.Frozen Meat. On 9th February the first two of the following telegrams were received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies from the Governor-General of New Zealand, and the third on 12th February : (1) My Ministers view with grave concern information received to the effect that all meat stores in the United Kingdom are at the present time very full, and that many insulated steamers with full cargoes are lying idle in United Kingdom ports-
awaiting discharge. They point out that stores throughout New Zealand at present contain approximately five million 60-lb. carcases, and it is estimated that the remainder of the period&apos; of requisition will produce another five million 60-lb,. carcases. My Ministers would be glad to be advised of the steps which will.be taken by the Imperial Government to reduce the congestion, which it is understood exists in the stores in the United Kingdom, to enable a clearance of the Dominion^ meat to be made prior to the commencement of the new season in November next. They urge the necessity for prompt action, so as to avoid a most serious position arising throughout New Zealand, with attendant financial difficulties and great loss to producers.(2) I have received the following memorandum from my Prime Minister: The Prime Minister begs to inform Bis Excellency that considerable unrest and some degree of apprehension exists among some producers of New Zealand with regard to outlook for the frozen meat trade in the immediate future. This feeling has arisen -consequent on the large accumulation of meat in store here, and the delayed arrival in the Dominion of shipping already promised by the Imperial authorities. It is feared that as a large quantity of meat owned by the Imperial Government will still be in store in New Zealand or in transit to England, when, as a result of the cessation of purchase by the Imperial Government, the producers of New Zealand have to go on the open market, they will find their selling operations most seriously hampered by the necessary occupation of shipping space by the Imperial Government meat and the placing of that meat on British markets in practical competition with their free meat. Having regard to these opinions, your Ministers feel that it is necessary that everything possible should, iioav be done to enable the best information obtainable as to all real facts -bearing on the outlook for the meat trade from July onwards to be made known to the producers. This is emphasized by the fact that Press statements have appeared in which allegations are made to the effect that the Imperial Govern-ment has during the past year given undue preference to South America in the matter of refrigerated shipping and that the Overseas Dominions are being intention-ally penalized thereby. While your Ministers wholly discredit these Press statements they yet feel it incumbent on them to bring the facts directly under your notice, and to respectfully request that you will at once submit the whole matter to the Imperial Government and endeavour to obtain by cable a full and clear statement of the actual facts in order to prevent a misapprehension of the position in the minds of producers.(3) As it is certain that at the end. of the present commandeer a very large quantity of meat will be left in the New Zealand cold stores, ray Prime Minister asks whether the Imperial Government will consider the advisability of renewing the commandeer for another season, as it is quite certain that if meat belonging to the Imperial Government and other meat belonging to the New Zealand producers is being placed on the British market at the same time, considerable loss and incon-venience will result. The Prime Minister also states that New Zealand producers are feeling very serious anxiety as to what may happen during the present year, especially in regard to the meat export trade.With reference to this telegram Lord Liverpool reported on 17th February that, as it was being freely stated in New Zealand that the Imperial Government was negotiating with the Argentine for meat for France and Belgium, his Prime Minister desired, to suggest that the meat in store in New Zealand and belonging to the Imperial Government should be utilized for this purpose, and in any case that the interests of New Zealand in this connexion should not be overlooked.Dairy Produce [B.E.H., x., p. 7]. On 9th February the following telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand was received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies informing him that when the Prime Minister of New Zealand met repre-sentatives of the producing interests on 6th February the following resolution was passed : The butter and cheese committees having considered the telegram from the Imperial Government regarding dairy produce, wish to inform the Prime Minister that in view of the unanimously expressed desire of the daily producers for free markets, the committees are unable to quote prices and reaffirm the decision of the-industry to revert at the termination of the contracts to pre-war conditions.Lord Liverpool went on to say that the Prime Minister had stated that the committees defined a free market as one subject to no restrictions, or, if restrictions lire imposed by the Imperial Government, one which is in other respects free to the vendors. In view of the foregoing the Prime Minister will be glad to learn as early -as possible, firstly, whether an unrestricted free market will meet the views of His
Majesty&apos;s Government; secondly, the nature of any restrictions likely to be imposed and thirdly, in the event of a free market not being permissible, whether the Imperial Government will be prepared to offer to purchase next seasohs exportable surplus of butter and cheese, and, if so, on what terms ?SOUTH AFRICA.Indian Commission. On 3rd February the Governor-General of South Africa, telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, informing him that Sir Johannes Lange, Colonel James Scott Wylie, K.C., M.V.O., and Messrs. William. Duncan Baxter, member of Legislative Assembly, and Henry John Hofmeyer had been appointed Commissioners ; and that the terms of reference were to enquire into and report on the provision of law affecting (a) the acquisition of land and rights affecting land in the Union by Asiatics and persons of Asiatic descent, for trading or other purposes ; (6) the trading or carrying on of business by such persons generally,, or in specified localities, and whether it is in the public interest to alter the law in any respect; (o) to make recommendations with regard to any difficulties and grievances which have arisen with regard to matters (a)-and (b).Lord Buxton added that he understood that the Commission was prepared to-commence its sittings at Capetown about the middle of March.Telegraphing again on the same clay he said that Sir Johannes Lange was a Judge of the Supreme Court who carried weight, and would be Chairman ; Colonel Wylie a prominent business . man of Durban, who was a member of the Indian Enquiry Commission of 1914; Mr. Baxter a Unionist member for one of the Cape divisions and a well-known politician ; Mr. Hofmeyer a Johannesburg solicitor in a good position, and some time mayor.The House of Assembly. A telegram from the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, dated 7th February, announced that the House of Assembly had been dissolved by a proclamation of 6th February ; nomination day would be 1.8th February, and polling clay would be 10th March.Natives of Southern Rhodesia, Telegraphing on 15th February, ReuteFs agent reported that he had leaf lit that the National Executive of the Labour Party had appointed a deputation jointly with the Parliamentary Labour Party.to lay before the Prime Minister the case of the natives in Southern Rhodesia, who, it is alleged, have been completely dispossessed of land-ownership rights of every kind. It was also intended to protest against any payment of the claim made by the Chartered Company for administrative deficits in respect of Rhodesia,, unless there was an impartial -enquiry into native conditions.Training Ships. Telegraphing from Capetown on 1st February, ReuteFs agent reported that a scheme was maturing to start a training ship, to be stationed at Durban, thanks to the generosity of an anonymous Durban resident, to whose son, who was killed in the war, it would be a memorial. The donor proposed to purchase a vessel and establish a fund sufficient to meet all costs of maintenance and training ; and it was intended to train from 150 to 200 boys as officers and seamen in the mercantile marine, the main object being to assist boys of limited means.Telegraphing again on 6th February, he reported that an anonymous Capetown resident was making a present of a training ship for Table Bay, and that the estimated cost was 20,0002.
