GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following paragraph is taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 15th January : The unemployment situation shows no signs of improvement; on the contrary, the number of unemployed persons steadily increases. The week under review has seen a general hardening on the part of Labour against the Governments proposals. The workers&apos; representatives on the joint industrial councils connected with Govern-ment industrial establishments demanded, at a meeting held on the 10th Jannary, that short-time working should not be accompanied by any reduction in wages, and strong protests have been made by the workers employed at the royal dockyards against the Governments short-time proposals. Of more significance is the attitude of the executive of the Labour party and the parliamentary committee of the trades union congress, who met in London on&apos; the 1.1th January, and decided to refuse to co-operate in the Governments proposed inquiry into unemployment, and strongly condemned the Governments short-time proposals. The meeting also decided to draw up a definite programme and policy with regard to unemployment, and, after securing its approval by a national joint conference representative of both bodies, to bring all possible pressure on the Government to secure its acceptance. Attention has already been called in this report to the tendency of the unemployed, especially in London, to organize distress committees and manage their own relief funds. It will be observed that the attempt is now being made to organize the unemployed on a national basis, and to co-operate with the organized Labour movement with a view to compelling the Government, by means of a general strike, if necessary, to adopt the policy of the provision of work or full maintenance for the unemployed, as well as the early re-establishment of trade with Russia and recognition of the Soviet Government. Two other significant developments of the situation are also worthy of mention, namely, the increasing difficulty experienced by trade unions, especially in the cotton industry, in meeting their members&apos; claims for unemployment benefit, and the increase in the number of reported cases of attempts, sometimes successful, by employers to persuade their workpeople to accept reduced rates of wages.INDIA.Mission l.o Kabul [B.E&apos;.R,, xxxiv, p. 3]. The Viceroy telegraphed [46 S.] on 11th January the report he had received from Sir Henry Dobbs, despatched the previous day from. Kabul. Sir Henry said that the mission had been, received by Tarsi at the Foreign Office, and later had had an houFs formal audience from the Ami)&apos; at the Dil Kusha palace. In both cases the mission had met with a very cordial reception. The Amir especially was courteous, dignified and friendly, and extended a hearty welcome coupled with expressions of hope that the negotiations would lead to the firm friendship and mutual advantage of both countries. He appeared much gratified at the reception that had. been given to his own representatives at. Mussoorie, and conveyed his thanks to the Viceroy for the message -which had been delivered to him.The Amir told Sir Henry that he proposed to assist at the first meeting of the conference, but would leave the general conduct of affairs to him and Tarsi. Referring to the events of 1919 he expressed his deep regret at the misunderstanding Which had. arisen.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent by the Viceroy on 6th and 15th January : I. (6th January). Some of the more important press comments on the presidents speech at the congress, of which a summary was telegraphed last week : Times of India. The address leaves on the mind an (? ineffaceable) impression -of courage without knowledge, patriotism without experience.   It is instinct with the
intellectual ferment now abroad untutored by any practical experience of the -conditions of national growth and progress.Bombay Glironicle. The embodiment of a considered philosophy of politics. The -causes of the discontent are dissected, a remedy is suggested, and the need of maintaining the right and humane attitude of mind which will stimulate and help the effort of nature to release the generous energies of our people is urged.Advocate of India. The speech could not be pleasing to the followers of Gandhi. Mr. Achariar has always been credited with a certain amount of courage, and he has lived, up to his reputation by boldly denouncing Gandhi&apos;s impossible programme.Justice. The arguments against non-co-operation, as preached by Gandhi, could not be received with rapt attention; not because they -were unsound, and illogical, but because the crowd that follows a fanatic would have no patience for arguments -of the kind advanced by the president.Tribune.-&apos;Wh address was a masterly performance. If British statesmanship knows its duty, it will immediately avail itself of the opportunity, and eagerly grasp the hand, extended by the president. To the extreme non-co-operator the address may indeed be profoundly disappointing.Amrita Bazar Pairika. A bold and. statesmanlike utterance with a ring of sincerity and earnestness. Bis anxiety to avoid a split and secure the harmonious co-operation of all parties is shared by all, who have the best interests of the country at heart. He has given the best advice according to his light, and we have no doubt the delegates will give due weight to the views of one who has a long and distinguished service to the country to his credit.Discussions in the congress centred round the-proposed main resolutions : first, that involving a change in the congress creed by deletion of the reference to the British connexion, and, second, declaring the intention of the congress to put in force the whole or any part of the scheme of non-co-operation from the renunciation of voluntary -association with the present Government to the refusal of payment of taxes at a time to he determined by either the Indian national congress or tire All-India congress -committee.   In moving the first resolution, namely, that the object of the congress is the attainment of &quot;swaraj &quot; by the people of India by ail legitimate and peaceful means, Gandhi said that wording was open to both interpretations, id est, &apos;.&apos; swaraj &quot; within  or without the British Empire, to be determined by the nature of such -connexion in the attainment of &quot;swaraj &quot;for India and the redress of the Punjab -and. Moslem grievances.   The resolution was a very elastic one, udiich could offer a platform for either view.   It was derogatory to the national dignity to think of a permanence of the British connexion at any cost.   The British Government not only refuses to redress wrongs under which Indians suffer, but declines to acknowledge her mistakes.   India could not possibly have the British connexion if the British people will not do elementary justice.   He did not for one moment suggest that they wanted such British connexion at all costs unconditionally.   If the British connexion was for the advancement of India, they did not want to destroy it; but if the British -connexion was inconsistent with national self-respect, then it was their bounden duty to destroy it.   As to the methods of obtaining &quot; swaraj,&quot; he urged non-violence and soul force.   Lala Lajpat Rai attacked the British statesmen, asking who there was in the British Cabinet in whom India had faith and whether there was a British -commonwealth in real sense.   He said it would be better to die than to be a partner in a blood-stained Empire.   He admitted that armed rebellion was out of the question, but concluded that there was nothing impossible for a nation of 300,000,000 to achieve in a manly and fearless way.   Jinnah opposed the resolution.    He said India could not achieve independence without bloodshed.&apos; The resolution, was a declaration which, though India had the will to adopt it, she had not the means to cany it out.   It was a &quot; camouflage &quot; which did not give any definite idea about the British connexion.2. He opposed the resolution, first, because complete independence was demanded without any instructions to the country (sic); secondly, because he believed India -could not secure such independence by bloodless means. Pie appealed to Gandhi, as to a man commanding the majority of the delegates, to halt before taking the hazardous step of changing the resolution. He was constantly heckled during his speech, which was ill received. Pal whole-heartedly supported the resolution, but thought swaraj might he-defined by the addition of the word &quot;democratic&quot; as a warning against the trend of modern imperialism to consolidate the white races. Colonel Wedgwood opposed the resolution, criticized the want of fair play and the treatment meted out to Jinnah, and, in the subjects committee, to Malaviya and
sir h. Goudhri., Swaraj should, be a democratic swaraj and not autocracy ; he warned: the audience that a change in the constitution would make it&apos; difficult, if not impossible, for friends in England to work for them. The resolution was carried by an overwhelming majority. As to the second resolution, regarding the means whereby swaraj may be realized, there was considerable discussion in the&apos;subjects committee and a notice of several amendments. Ultimately unity was secured and Das&apos;s resolution accepted. , This resolution, which was subsequently carried at a sitting of the congress after all amendments had been withdrawn, was to the following; effect: The existing Government of India has forfeited the confidence of the country. The people of India are determined to establish swaraj. The methods adopted by them prior to the special sessions failed to secure due recognition, rights and liberties, and the redress of many u rongs. The congress, while reaffirming the resolution of non-violent non-co-operation, declares that the entire scheme, or any part or parts of it, with the renunciation of voluntary association with the present Government at one-end, and the refusal to pay taxes at the other, should be put in force at a time to be determined by either the Indian national congress or the All-India congress committee, and that meanwhile, to prepare the-country for it, effective steps should continue to be taken in that behalf: (A) Calling on parents and guardians of school children, not the children themselves, under the age of 10 to make greater efforts for the purpose of withdrawing-them from Government-aided schools, and to provide training in the national schools.(13) Calling on students of 16 and over to withdraw&apos; without delay, irrespective of consequences, from the Government schools if they feel that it is against their conscience to continue in such schools, and to devote themselves to special non-co-operation service.(C; Calling on the trustees and managers of and teachers in- Government, schools to help to nationalize them.(1)) Calling-on lawyers to make greater efforts to suspend practice.(B) In order to make India economically independent, calling on merchants to-carry out a gradual boycott of foreign trade relations, and having a scheme of economic-boycott, planned and formulated by a committee of experts.(F) Calling for the utmost possible contribution of help and sacrifice to the national -movement.        . ,-(G) Organizing committees in a village or group of villages, with central provincial organizations, to accelerate the progress of non-co-operation.(H) Organizing a baud of national workers for a service to be called the Indian, national service by taking effective steps to raise a national fund for the purpose of financing the foregoing national service and the non-co-operation movement.The congress congratulates the nation on the progress made, and claims, that the new councils do not represent, the country ; it trusts that those elected, in spite of the deliberate abstention from the polls of an overwhelming majority, will resign their seats, and if they retain them, that the electors will studiously: refrain from asking political service from them. It recognizes the- growing-friendliness between the police and soldiers and the people, and hopes that the-former will refuse to subordinate the country to the fulfilment of the orders of their officers. Special emphasis is laid on non-violence as an integral part of the resolution, and it impresses on the people that non-violence in word and deed is essential. Finally, in order to establish swaraj within one year, it urges all bodies-to devote exclusive attention to the promotion&apos; of non-violence aud non-co-operation,, to advance Hindu-Moslem unity, to settle disputes between brahmins and others, aud to make special efforts to rid Hinduism of the reproach of untouchability. In moving the resolution, Das denied a charge that the non-co-operation passed in the subjects committee was weaker and not stronger than, the resolution passed at the special - session at Calcutta. In the-latter, there was no&apos;clear declaration that the nation was-resolved to put in force the entire scheme. It is believed that that may not be necessary, but, if necessary, the people of India will not shrink.Gandhi,- supporting the resolution, said there had been absolutely no violation of obligation. [The congress resolution did not bind a man&apos;s conscience ; though he feft that the majority were of opinion that he held, would revise the party by making congress itself a, fetish, and in its mandate declared that they, were not tampering with obligations of service imposed on employees of Government, civil, military and police, but asking them not to kill their conscience] (sic).   In, this-
0resolution they would forget all differences and acrimony that had ground their public life during the last three months.B. 0. Bal said he had never been against the principle and policy of non-co-operation, though he might have had differences in regard to some of the details. He supported the resolution, and said differences must be merged in the united cause. Lajpat Rai also supported the resolution, which he claimed had removed all objections without weakening any essentials.3. Whilst the extremist press expresses jubilation at the&apos;maintenance of unity, the fact that both resolutions were compromised, and the existence of a strong minority at the congress are not desired. Further, the non-co-operation resolution seems to indicate clearly that the impracticability of non-co-operation, at any rate in regard to schools and the suspension of practice by lawyers, is recognized. This being so, and . as the boycott of the councils is no longer a living issue, it remains to be seen in what- direction, apart from the general vilification of the Government, the activities of -Gandhi and his supporters will now be turned.4. Other resolutions. The congress extended a hearty support to the Indians in East and South Africa, in their struggle against the treatment of the East, and South Africa Governments. The approved policy of peaceful non-co-operation was initiated by the Indians of East Africa. It considered the helplessness of the nation in the matter of the treatment of Indians in British dominions overseas a clear demonstra-tioli of the necessity for non-co-operation.   It placed on record grateful appreciation- of the valuable services rendered by Andrews in the cause of Indians indentured in Fiji and elsewhere. It condemned the Government for callous disregard of the needs of the Indian people in regard to the exportation of foodstuffs. Bomanji moved a resolution for the boycott of the Duke of ConnaughFs visit, explaining that there was no wish to show disrespect to the royal family, but to call upon the people who take part in the congress to refrain from being present at any functions or festivities in connexion with the&apos;visit. The currency policy of the Government was vigorously attacked by Bomanji.   The president moved a resolution tiiat tbe board of the-congress committee and the paper India be abolished, and another paying homage to the memory of McSwiney and sympathizing with Ireland in the struggle for independence.The Moslem League held a meeting under the presidency of Ansari, who gave an account of the work of the caliphate delegation in Europe. He referred to the obdurate statesman of Europe who would not yield an inch. He dwelt on the caliphate and Punjab wrongs and the methods by which they should be redressed, the spirit behind which has to be fought and conquered. He attributes the conduct of Great Britain to the notion of the superiority of West over East, and said the question was therefore not only one of India&apos;s honour, but a struggle for the emancipa-tion of enslaved Asiatics from the thraldom of the West. He therefore advocated non-co-operation as laid down by Gandhi, justifying it as a divine injunction imposed in the Moslem sbariat. Mohamed Ali moved that the objects of the Moslem League lie: (a) The attainment of swaraj by the people of India by all legitimate and peaceful means ; (6) to protect in advance the political, religious and other rights and interests- of Indian Moslems ; (c) to promote friendship and union between Moslems and the- other communities iu India ; (d) to maintain and promote brotherly relations between ,the Moslems of India and. those other countries throughout the world. A change in creed was inevitable,, and as India had not the means to fight, the word &quot; peaceful &quot; -was essential. Hasrafc Moliini said the time might come when violence would be required, and received support from others. Mohamed Ali said the words of the resolution were in conformity with the existing situation, but if circumstances changed, the creed might be changed accordingly. On the motion of Kitchlew, the league adopted a resolution calling on Indians to increase their efforts for the attainment of swaraj, to save the soldiery from the moral degradation which would result from the utilization of Indian arms to advance the aggressive qualities of British conquest as expressed by the Esher committee. Non-co-operation was adopted, also a resolu-tion appealing to Hindus to refrain from obtaining cow protection, through legislation. Before formally dissolving,- a resolution was passed requesting Amir Amanullah to reject peace or alliance with the British Government as Indians had no quarrel with Afghanistan, and as Britain had opposed the Caliphate such an alliance was not- conceived as a plea for protecting India, but for strengthening a hold on the country.5. We have not seen, any Hindu comments on this resolution, but it can hardly -be doubted that it -would be as bitter to their taste as that on cow protection. 24-3 b
6. The All-India Liberal federation held a meeting in Madras under the presidency of Chintaniini ; a large gathering, delegated from all parts of India.   Chintamini,.. whilst vigorously condemning the non-co-operation movement and the swaraj resolution of the congress, described the recommendations of the Esher committee as reactionary and  objectionable, and criticized strongly the Rowlatt cornmittee&apos;s  report.   lie-appealed to the Government to take advantage of the development in Greece and revise the Turkish treaty and soothe the heart of the Punjab.   He declared that the military policy would be a test of their sincerity.   The &quot;Liberal party was the real centre party; it was all for reforms, but was content with steady, though slow, progress.   It claimed, that it had gained ground in the country and that increasing&quot;-numbers were joining, whilst the extremists&apos; party was fast losing its hold over the popular mind.   Resolutions were carried welcoming II.Rib the Duke of Connaught and the appointment of Lord Sinha as Governor of Bihar and Orissa; protesting against the recommendations of the Esher committee and against the disabilities enforced on Indians in East Africa; and urging the appointment of a commission to-examine the fiscal policy.   Resolutions moved by Sastri were also carried, protesting against the failure of the Government to render justice, by imposing inadequate punishments upon officers guilty of acts of cruelty, &amp;c, during the martial law. ad minis- -tration in the Punjab, and calling for the abolition of all distinctions in law based, on race.7. Reports from provinces : -Bihar and Orissa. Gandhi&apos;s hurried tour prior to the congress did not satisfy the expectations of its promoters. At Arrah, Patna, his reception was by no means whole-hearted, and at Arrah and Gaya the meetings very nearly fiascos. They were-attended by large numbers, the people being stirred by his reputation for unworldly conduct, but his principles were so little understood that his meeting at Arrah stimulated recruitment for the army. The tone of the speeches delivered at Patna was unexpectedly mild, and at Darbhanga he disclaimed connexion with or approval of Swanii Bidyanand, the leader of the Kisan Sabha movement&quot;. At Monghyr and Bhagalpur he had. more success. Non-co-operation had some spurious success in the -urban areas, but in the rural areas the effect produced was surprisingly small, though the campaign of vilification of the Government, continued indefinitely, will poison the -minds of the common people. Trouble is still smouldering in the coalfields, but an immediate general strike is not probable. Colonel Wedgwood and La j pat Rai, visiting them recently, laid stress on thorough organization before a strike was attempted, and urged that the strike weapon should not be used except for very strong reasons.Bombay. The lull in political activities continues, interest centring in the congress deliberations at Nngpur. It is reported that seven members of the Memon community are resigning their posts of justice of the peace and one a title, under social pressure. Bomanji resigned his justiceship of the peace and two other titles. The despatch of the Government of India on the position of the Indians in East Africa has on the whole been welL received.United Provinces. There has been a lull here also after the activity during the elections and the diversion caused by the Nagpur.congress and the set-back received by the non-co-operators at Benares and Aligarh weakened the (&apos;? cause). The-Moderates are organizing a movement against non-co-operation by establishing liberal or Reform leagues; the supporters of non-co-operation, actually Gauclhbs lecturers,, are penetrating to the smaller villages. National schools have been started in a few districts, but there is no promise of lasting vitality. GandhLs visit to Partabgarh shows that the tenants are not interested in non-co-operation in itself. The real grievance in Oudh, at any rate, is uncontrolled ejectment.Punjab.--Here too a lull in the political agitation since the elections. Cases have been reported of attempts to boycott voters and others who took part in the elections and the fracas at Panipat, but security proceedings under section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prevented trouble and had good effect. A few pauchayats started to dispose of petty cases without reference to the courts. .In the Sikh districts where politicians have penetrated, the situation is bad, anyone aiding the Government. being socially boycotted; and propaganda in the villages is on the increase, though the position in localities free from extremist agitators is satisfactory. The application, of the Seditious Meetings; Act has had a good effect, and the declaration of the Government of India applying the Act to certain other districts of Lahore and Jullundur has had a sobering effect, though the local Government has not yet
proclaimed these districts. Postmen have been on strike, and some.inconvenience has been &quot;caused.- Arrangements have been made to continue delivering letters.Assam.-The students of the Mnrari Chand College, Sylhet, decided to send delegates to - the All-India colleges students&apos; conference at Nagpur, and passed a resolution that they were not opposed to the principle of non-co-operation but, in the absence of national colleges, considered it inadvisable to leave Government institutions. They asserted that-this attitude towards the authorities was not disrespectful.Delhi. A public apology has been tendered to the Imam at Juma Masjid for the demonstration against him reported in the weekly telegram dated 7th Mav 1920 [B.E.R. xviii, p. 6]. .Asaf Ali, who acted as the nien&apos;s representative in. the recent strike in the Delhi Electric Light, and Tramways Company, has outlined a scheme of forming every kind of panchayat and trade union, and of establishing friendly relations therewith, by fomenting successful strikes and negotiations for an increase of pay. When a union is in full working order, it is to be employed to conduct the social boycott of the-opponents of non-co-operation.North-West Frontier Province. A bomb was thrown about 1 o&apos;clock on 28th. December into the compound of the Indian clergymen attached to the mission church near the Kpbati gate in Peshawar city. Two children were slightly damaged. The bomb was of-lead moulded over a tin, and cut criss-cross, and apparently locally made.General. Except for the congress and the Moslem league, there has been a distinct lull in activity. . The appointment of Sundar Sinjh Majithia has disappointed a section of opinion in the Punjab, but elsewhere selections of Ministers appear to have been well received by moderate opinion.II. (1.5th January). Provincial reports.Madras. There is a lull in political agitation as the results of the elections are-announced. Some further attempts have been made to organize Madras students, into boycotting the colleges, but beyond one demonstration of about 1,500 students who marched through Madras, led by the Moslem volunteers, there has been little to-remark upon. In the Guntur district the non-co-operators had some success with two-newly constituted municipalities; the councillors have resigned and the municipal administration is at a standstill. The deadlock at the Buckingham mills continues,, and a non-official committee of six persons has been appointed to make an enquiry into and report, on the occurrences of 9th December, already reported to you. At the non-Brahmin federation of Madras, the president, Raman Pillay, extended a hearty welcome to H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught and vigorously attacked the non-co-operation movement, pointing out its potentialities of clanger and the difficulty of control as evidenced by the Saty Agraha movement in 1919. He asserted that the saner elements of the country had altogether dissociated themselves from it.Section 2. Bombay. Chotani, president of the central caliphate committee, has addressed a manifesto to the congress and Moslem league leaders, urging the necessity of these two bodies ceasing to be merely deliberative, and of forming themselves into executive organizations. The ostensible reason is to set up some fully developed organization &quot;to take the place of the barriers they are breaking down daily,&quot; but in reality to meet the demands upon the central caliphate committee from students, schools, pleaders,&amp;c, that have joined the non-co-operation movement. Chotani suggests that the congress and Moslem league appoint standing committees with sub-committees or boards (.1) for finances to raise a national loan, (2) for national education, who should get 50 per cent of the loan, (3) for national industries and commerce, with a bank and an information bureau, and (4) for national propaganda.Section. 3. Pir Bakadar Shah has made a declaration of complete loyalty to the Government. He is the leading- pir of Matiari, a non-co-operation stronghold in Sincl, and his action is calculated to have a very good effect. The Government of India despatch on the position of Indians in East Africa has, on the whole, been well received.Bengal. There is a lull iu political activity. The Bengal caliphate committee sanctioned Rs. 6,000 for a special train to convey the delegates to the Nagpur congress. Gandhi contemplates a tour this month with the Ali brothers and has stated that he will remain in Eastern Bengal for three months. His speeches at Dacca do not appear to have produced any great result. Abdidla Hafiz, secretary of the Dacca caliphate committee, is being prosecuted under section 171 (/) of the Indian
sPenal Code for a statement contained in a leaflet &quot; that anyone who would try to become a member of council, or would vote, would be beclin (irreligious), aud would thereby sever his connexion with Islam.&quot;Section 4. C. R. Das openly asserts that lie intends to make the greatest possible capital out of the case, as section 171 (/) is not intended to cover cases of this nature. If convicted, he would iuflame all. Mohameclans by proclaiming that the Government of India has purposely passed a law interfering with religion ; while, if the Govern-ment lost the case, he would similarly announce that the Government officials have purposely, against the law, tried to interfere with their religion.Section 5. The remaining state prisoners were released on 3rd January on the introduction of the reforms : this was well received in the press.Section 6. Bihar and Orissa. There is a lull in the non-co-operation movement. There is every reason to expect that a few students will ultimately cut their connexion with the recognized educational institutions, and those likely to do so are not students whom the heads of colleges will be sorry to lose. There is widespread discontent amongst the police, due to economic and not political causes. The question, of further revising pay is under consideration, and will be sanctioned by telegram.Section 7. Swami Biswanand has stirred up considerable excitement in Adra amongst the railway menial staff, and on the 31st December 1,000 to 1,800 of the menial staff went on strike, including a number of private servants of Europeans. The deputy-commissioner interviewed the strikers, and succeeded in inducing them to work, but on the 3rd the swami returned, and the deputy-commissioner issued an order under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to all railway menials to abstain from attending the meeting. The order under section 144- was later also served on the swami, directing him to refrain from making speeches calculated to promote feelings of enmity and hatred between classes. His main object is to prevent cow killing by any means in his power, and speeches on the 30th, not only inflamed the minds of the menials and subordinate servants, but also resulted in strong feeling against the European and Anglo-Indian subordinates, most of whom were boycotted by their sweepers and servants for three days, and wrere unable to get meat or supplies from the bazaar; with difficulty they were prevented from going down to the bazaar to bring back their servants by force.Section 8. The swami&apos;s present attitude on cow killing is a new departure, calculated to bring about a strike and boycott at any time. It is obviously aimed at Europeans. The order under section 144 has been approved, and the deputy-commissioner instructed to prosecute him at once if he disobeys the order. The swami&apos;s movements are closely watched, and an accurate report is taken of his speeches. As soon as satisfactory evidence is available, sanction to prosecute under section 124a or 153a of the Indian Penal Code will be applied for, or alternative action will .be taken under section 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Section 9. The welcome extended at Madras to the Duke of Connaught was a royal one in its warmth ; enormous crowds were present, and there was not a single untoward incident. The appointment of Lord Reading is very well received, except in one or two of the most extreme papers.Burma. The boycott of colleges and. schools continues. The boycott is approved by the director of the Young Men&apos;s Buddhist Association, who proposes converting all the association schools into national schools. Six or seven lakhs of rupees have been promised in. support of the movement. The capture of the association by extremists was facilitated by Colonel Wedgwoods denunciation of the Burma Government. The prosecution of the Rangoon Mail under Section 153a, resulted in a sentence of four months&apos; simple imprisonment for the editor, and two months for the printer.Central Provinces. The following is a brief appreciation of the congress from the Central Provinces. The outstanding feature was the personal domination of Gandhi over all the political leaders and followers. Opposition to his view was overcome without difficulty, owing to his strong hold over the bulk of the delegates and visitors. The direct opponents of non-co-operation were silenced without difficulty. The moderates of Nagpur were not heard, extremist opponents under Khaparde and Dr. Munje were brushed aside, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya&apos;s effort was nugatory, Jinnah carried no influence, Lajpat Rai wobbled and then became silent. Their view appears to be that it was hopeless to attempt any real opposition in the temper of the meeting and they must wait.   Gandhi/s power was also shown in
the change of the presidential address. The address was modified in several important points in which the president had in previously printed copies opposed many of the items of the non-co-operators&apos; programme. In the subjects committee there was a long debate over the change in the congress creed. The more violent proposals in favour of complete independence, and a republic, were defeated in - spite of the efforts of the Ali brothers, ancl Gandhi carried his formula by an overwhelming majority .; the opposition of Jinnah, Das, Pal and Malaviya in favour of the retention in the resolution on the creed, of the British connexion being over-ruled. Colonel Wedgwood and Spoor did their best but also failed. There is very little hope of even any important split in the congress party, or any open secession of the opponents of Gandhi&apos;s policy, who, it is said, will retire to their tents and will not form a separate party and lead a counter propaganda against his policy. Gandhi is said to be well satisfied with the progress made in the non-co-operation campaign, in spite of the small response hitherto made in regard to specific items of the programme. He regards the past few months as a preliminary period for the preparation of the ground. IE the response from the educated classes has not been much, the masses have been largely influenced in principle. A period of intensive campaign will follow, amongst both the masses ancl the educated classes; committees of propaganda are being organized in all districts, towns, and tahsils, and emissaries are being despatched from the outside. Of other conferences at Nagpur those of the depressed classes and native states were of some interest. At the former the leading mahar explained that his community opposed non-co-operation, but would accept it if Gandhi could induce the castes to remove the ban on untouchables. Gandhi suggested non-co-operation of the mahars with the higher castes until they were admitted to equality. At the latter conference, attended mainly by a few hundred delegates from petty Rajputana states, lurid pictures were painted of the tyranuy prevailing in the native states, calling for radical reforms.General. The leaders are now considering how and when effect should be given to the non-co-operation programme adopted at Nagpur. Gandhi desired to fix 1st February, Lajpat Rai the 16th ; C. R. Das is in favour of postponing the matter till the end of March. Das is reported to have said that the chief stumbling block in carrying out the non-co-operation programme would be the zamindars. Gandhi considered that these would be brought to their senses if tenants were induced not to pay rents. It is also reported that at a secret conference at Nagpur, Gandhi opposed resort to violence, which was favoured by Hasrat Mohani and Swami Sraddhanand, on the ground that till, India was united, this would only result in giving the Government an opportunity of repression. We are carefully considering the whole situation in the light of the proceedings at hlagpur and. other information. The indications seem to be that the failure of the attack on educational institutes ancl the attempts to induce lawyers to suspend^ practice is recognized, and that the efforts of the non-co-operators will now be directed towards the organization of propaganda among the masses, more particularly tenantry and labour. Developments in this direction will require ancl receive close watching, and more frequent resort to action under the ordinary law may be necessary. At present we are not inclined to think any fundamental change in policy will be necessary, but propose to consult the local Governments ; and we must, of course, be largely guided by the course of events.THE DOMINIONS.Stale-aided Settlement. On 6th January the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Australia and New Zealand saying : His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to consult at an early date with the Governments of the self-governing Dominions as to the possibility of initiating on a large scale a policy of state-aided settlement within the Empire based on mutual co-operation between the Governments concerned.The objects in view would be to meet the exceptional conditions which have resulted from the war, to distribute and use the population of the Empire to the best advantage, to develop the cultivation of land and other natural resources, and to ensure that the largest possible proportion of the population likely to leave the United 24-3 C
Kingdom in the near future should be attracted to the Dominions and be available to strengthen and build up their national life and not be diverted to foreign countries.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to arrange a special conference on this question in February, and they trust that your Government will be able to appoint repre-sentative to attend.CANADA.Miscellaneous.-The following items of information have been communicated by the Department of External Affairs :  (1) The estimated total external trade of Canada for 1920 was. $2,630,000,000, or $50,000,000 in excess of the previous best year, being $400,000,000 over 1919.(2) Business conditions in Canada generally are quiet, but the outlook is considered to be very hopeful.(3) The Honourable N. W. Rowell, K.C., M.P., one of the Canadian delegates to the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva, said on his return home that Canadian financial, social, and industrial conditions were much better than he had found in any other country during his six months&apos; tour abroad.(4) The Canadian chartered banks opened 400 new branches last year, and did much to strengthen their international connexions.(5) The Canadian income-tax collections during the month of December last were three times those of the corresponding month in 1919.(6) The total value of investments of United States capital in Canada during 1920 is estimated at $320,000,000.(7) Parliament will meet on 14th February.AUSTRALIA.Wool [B.E.R., xxxiv, p. 8].-On 7th January the Governor-General transmitted the following message from his Prime Minister : I have received your telegram of 31st December in reply to my telegram of Sth December. The fact that certain precautionary measures are necessary in the formation of the British Australian Wool Realization Association, Limited, in order to protect the interests present and future of the British Government and of the Commonwealth is fully appreciated.&apos;As the formation of trusts and combines is illegal within the Commonwealth the fullest assurance can be given on that point.: Matters have &apos;been discussed with Sir John Higgins and his colleagues by whom I have been advised of the negotiations carried on with Sir A. Goldfinch and of the position reached. You can rest assured that the formation of the British Australian Wool Realization Association has one objective only-the stabilization of the wool industries of the British Empire. Personal or individual gain is absent in the formation of the wool association. It is realized that the occupation of land, the breeding of sheep, the growing of wool, and wool manufactures are Australian ideals which can only be accomplished successfully by co-ordination and co-operation with British industries.The present time is opportune for British and Australian interests to come closer together on account of the large stocks of carry-over wool ; and the results cannot be other than satisfactory for both parties and for the betterment of the Empire wool trade if wisely prosecuted. Australian growers look for stable and permanent markets for wool, British manufacturers for regular supplies of raw material and continuous outputs of products, steps conducive to the restoration of confidence in and development of the wool industry, and as a natural corollary steady and constant employment benefiting operatives in Great Britain and Australia.The policy of the association will be to dispose of all carry-over wool as promptly as market conditions permit, the sooner the better. As long as the carry-over wrool remains in a raw condition it is a positive menace to Australian wool growing.The Higgins committee readily agree to the qualification that His Majesty&apos;s Government may revoke the agency arrangement at any time if the conduct of the business of the association gives ground for dissatisfaction, because they reason that no revocation will occur without just cause which should never arise.Having accepted the stipulations contained in your telegram, it is hereby mutually agreed to liquidate the Australian section of the imperial wool purchase account at the earliest possible date, and to handover half of the surplus assets ascertained and
certified to exist on the agreed settling day to the Commonwealth Government, which will in turn hand it over to the realization association on account of the Australian wool growers in final settlement of the reciprocal obligations under the three wool purchase contracts. It is further agreed that subject to an agreement being arrived at between the Minister of Munitions and Sir John Higgins; chairman of the &quot; special&quot; executive committee appointed by the representatives of the Australian wool industry, with my concurrence, His Majesty&apos;s Government assent to the formation of the British Australian Wool Realization Association, Limited. It is also agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall sell through the agency of the proposed association their half of the Australian carry-over wool, subject to the before-mentioned qualification.Your reference to an arrangement, which you hope will shortly be made, whereby the New Zealand carry-over wool will be at the disposal of the association, is noted with, great interest by the Commonwealth Government. It is hardly necessary for me to emphasize the very great importance of this ; I. trust that the arrangement may be concluded without delay.i will not make any public announcement at present as requested in your telegram, but I stress the advisability of no undue delay, and I suggest that, in order that the information may appeal&apos; in British and Australian newspapers on the same date, a day for publicity to be given should be arranged mutually.NEW ZEALAND.Wool [B.E.R., xxxiv, p. 9].--The following telegram from the Governor-Cteneral was received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 8th January : -With reference to your cypher telegram of 4th January in regard to negotiations between the Commonwealth and the Imperial Government concerning woof, I am requested by my Prime Minister to inform you that the New Zealand Government does not concur in the interpretation which the above-mentioned telegram seems to place upon the agreements arrived at between the New Zealand Government and the Imperial Government relating to New Zealand wool. It is clear that there-were three successive arrangements with the Government of New Zealand, the first covering the clip up to. 30th June 19.17, the second covering the clip to 30th June 1918, and the third covering all subsequent clips up to 12 months after the cessation of hostilities, which now means 30th June 1920. As is clear from the communications between the High Commissioner and the director of raw materials in December last, there is no misunderstanding on this point. As to clips after the clip of 30th June 1918, the agreement arrived at between the Prime Minister and the director in London in August 1918 contained specific provisions for those subsequent clips, namely, that the profits per pound to be paid to New Zealand should&apos; be calculated on the basis of the profits realized on the Australian purchase, and should not be less. Therefore, the arrangement as to all clips subsequent to June 1918 contained a term wholly differing from antecedent arrangements which were confined to a percentage of the actual profit realized on the two previous clips; The New Zealand (lovernmeut fully concede that the agreement constituted by your telecram to the Governor-General of New Zealand of 3rd July .1.920, and the reply of the Administrator of the New Zealand Government dated 13th July 1920, is binding upon the New Zealand Government, and according to its tenour modifies and controls the previous arrange-ments. The apparent difference between the New Zealand Government and the Imperial Government arises upon the interpretation of the two cables last referred to..My Government did not and could not understand the telegram of 3rd July as a request for their concurrence iu combining the two clips respectively ending June 1917 and 1918, with regard to which a simple percentage of profits had been agreed upon in one mass with, the clips subsequent to June 1.918, in respect of which special definite ancl separate terms of an entirely different nature had been reached. The New Zealand Government understand the telegram of the 3rd July to mean that with regard to all clips after June 1918 there should be no differentiation between the clips, and that the basis of divisible profit, if any, should be arrived at upon the whole output of the years subsequent to June 1918 without differentiation of the clips. But the New Zealand Government never anticipated nor understood that such a confusion as must necessarily arise if the exactly ascertained or ascertainable profits of. the two previous years were mixed with the hypothetical profit or deficiency on clips of the subsequent years was suggested, and therefore the New Zealand Govern -24-3 JJ
merit understood tbe proposal to them to be that the two clips ending June 1917 and June 1918 should be dealt with and accounted for separately, and that the profit on all subsequent clips should be arrived at without reference to the year of clip or possible difference of ownership of the several subsequent clips. The two telegrams of 3rd July and 13th July have again been carefully considered and the New Zealand Government see no ground for the contention that the telegram of 3rd July is reasonably capable of - an interpretation other than that which they then placed upon it, on which they have acted, and to which they still adhere. The Government of New Zealand had then, and has still to consider, not only tbe arrange-ments -which would be most convenient to the two Governments, but also the fact that they had made different arrangements on behalf of owners of the wool of the first two clips ; and they could not have agreed to disregard the accrued profits to tbe owners of the wool of the first two clips and throw those profits into an account leading to ultimate extinction without the consent of the owners of the clips who were entitled to the profits. The Prime Minister considers that this must be manifest to the Imperial Government, and, therefore, that it will understand that the Govern-ment of New Zealand cannot accept an interpretation of the arrangement expressed in the telegrams referred to other than that on which they acted and have since assumed to be the intention.Secondly, if it can be conveniently arranged that New Zealand shall be adequately represented in the control of the proposed association, and separately, the New Zealand Government are prepared favourably to consider the request of the Imperial Govern-ment that wool of the clips subsequent to June 1918 should be dealt with by the association ; though they cannot agree, for the reasons above stated, to wool of the clips of June 1917 and 1918 respectively, being so dealt with or in any manner confused with the wool of tbe subsequent clips.It is hardly possible for Australian control alone to determine conditions for both couutries, since Australian wool generally differs from New Zealand wool so largely in quality aud description.On ICth January the Governor-General again telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : My telegram 8th January. The Government of New Zealand has given careful consideration to.the proposal that the control of the accumulated stocks of New Zealand wool held by His Majesty&apos;s Government should be placed in the bands of the British Australian Wool Realization Association. The Government of New Zealand desires to express its appreciation of the assistance and support rendered to New Zealand producers by the Ministry of Munitions in the policy of strong holding adopted by it and to further state that a continuance of control by the Ministry would be fully acceptable. Producers and their representatives have from press reports and private communications formed the opinion that as a result, of post-war re-organization the Munitions Department may be abolished with the accompanying possibility of tbe New Zealand wool stocks held by His Majesty&apos;s Government being realized quickly at whatever prices are obtainable with a consequent risk of the market being broken up. A meeting of producers&apos; representatives held on .14-th January discussed these points, and as regards the question of the control of the Government stocks of New Zealand wools by the British Australian Wool Realization Association expressed a favourable opinion subject to New Zealand interests being strongly safe-guarded in every way and adequate representation being given to New Zealand on. the management of the association.The Government of New Zealand realizes that difference in the quality and classes of the greater proportions of Australia aud New Zealand wools.respectively and the greater demand for finer rather than for coarser avooIs constitute an especial reason for ensuring adequate safeguards for the interests of the NeAy Zealand wool-growers. Having regard, therefore, to the existing position as understood here, the Government of New Zealand would greatly prefer that tbe held-over avooI of New Zealand origin be handled by His Majesty&apos;s Government under the existing organization with a continued policy of strong holding; but if no alternative exists, it would respectfully request that His Majesty&apos;s Government will advise by telegraph Avhat safeguards for New Zealand wool-growers are contemplated and what representation on the British Australian Wool Realization Association His Majesty&apos;s Government considers could be given to New Zealand. The producers&apos; meeting referred to above Avas not open to the Press, and the result of the discussions on wool realization have not been made public.
Meat. On 16th January the Governor-General telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of Slate for the Colonies : The Government of New Zealand is seriously concerned regarding the continued maintenance of the present controlled prices for imported meat, particularly mutton and Jamli, these prices being far below the parity of home-grown meat. New Zealand producers are already seriously handicapped by the high freight and handling charges on meat, and. are further faced with &quot;depressed and uncertain markets for wool and for animal by-products; hence, the Government of New Zealand feels constrained to urge on His Majesty&apos;s Government a serious reconsideration of its present arrange-ment for controlling the prices of New Zealand meat. The position regarding the marketing of meat purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government is fully realized, but it is pointed out that these meat stocks include lamb in so small a quantity as to be practically negligible, while light-weight mutton constitutes only a relatively small proportion of the whole, ft is therefore respectfully requested that His Majesty&apos;s Government give careful and favourable consideration to the complete removal of -control over New Zealand, meat; or, if circumstances will not immediately permit such removal, that the maximum prices for New Zealand lamb and mutton be increased by not less than 2d. per lb. for lamb and Id. for mutton, thus placing New Zealand producers in a more equitable market position than at present.Irish Propaganda.- On 1.0th January a telegram was received from the Governor-General reporting that co-operative dairy companies in New Zealand were being circularized by an organization called The Irish Agricultural Organization Society, Dublin, which appealed for the moral and financial assistance which they alleged was necessary in view of the very large number of creameries in Ireland which had been destroyed by the forces of the Grown. The Governor-General then asked to be informed by telegraph whether his Prime Minister might be informed of any special reasons for action being taken in the event of there being any truth in the statement made. Mr. Massey, he added, had observed that it looked like the beginning of an -extensive propaganda campaign.   The appeal was dated .1.5th November .1920.SOUTH AFRICA.Martial Law withdrawn in South-West Africa. Telegraphing from Pretoria on 3rd January ReuteFs agent reported that the Gazette had published a. decree withdrawing martial law from South-West Africa.Portugal and the Transvaal. The following telegram is dated 1th January 1920, but the place of origin is not given : ReuteFs agency is informed by the Portuguese Minister that there is no truth in the reports of negotiations between the Lisbon Government and the Union Government concerning the railways and harbours of Delagoa Pay. The convention entered into between Mozambique and the Transvaal Government before the establishment of the South African Union for commercial arrangements between the two adjoining colonies expired in April last, but it has not been denounced and if this is not done by April next, it will probably then be renewed with the Union Government on a new basis. The new High Commissioner is leaving Lisbon shortly for Mozambique and he will enquire into the conditions prevailing and report to his -Government,   Till then no change in the existing situation is to be looked for.
