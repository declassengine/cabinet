GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 17th July :   .Labour Conferences.  The annual conferences of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain have now been concluded. Both con-ferences have had to deal with wages demands which affect the Government and with Government schemes for the future control of the industry. The railwaymen accepted the recent&apos;wages award, and showed themselves favourable to the Ministry of Transports scheme. On the other hand, the miners have put in a double demand for increased wages and reduced prices, ancl have declared a most determined opposition to the Ministry of Mines Bill.The Trades Union Congress and Ireland. The most important event of the week in this connexion is the holding of the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress on the 13th&apos; July. In drawing attention to the leading features of the Congress it may first be remarked how definitely the Irish question has assumed the place of first importance. It will be remembered that in point of time the incident of the Jolly George preceded the North Wall incident, ancl that the embargo of the National Union of Railwaymen on Polish munitions, though recalled when first put to the test, and the embargo of the International Federation of Trade Unions on Hungary both took place about, the same time as the North Wall incident. Immediately before the Congress, too, appeared the second interim report of the Labour Delegation to Russia. There were thus at least four important topics which the Trades Union Congress might have discussed, namely, Russia, Polish munitions, Hungary and Ireland. The Russian question, as a whole, however, was excluded on the plea that the matter was in the hands of a joint body representing the Trades Union Congress and the National Labour Party.- The Hungarian question was ignored, ancl Polish munitions were only incidentally dealt with in one phrase of the miners&apos; resolution. The emergency resolution on Russia deals only with the decisions of the Spa , Conference. These facts are some indication of the deep interest of the British trade unions in Irish affairs, which affect their membership. They also, perhaps, indicate a desire on the part of the leaders cf the trade union movement not to invite defeat by. dissipating the energies of the movement.With regard to the resolutions actually passed, the principle of the resolution formulated by the National Union of Railwaymen is that, while the Government are considered responsible for the present state of affairs in Ireland, the British trade union movement calls for a&apos; truce, and calls upon both sides in Ireland to contribute to the making of that trace. Further, the resolution envisages nothing more than Dominion Home Rule for Ireland. This restriction, ancl this hint that action on the part of Sinn Fein as well as of the Government is necessary, appear to have caused much of the hostility to the resolution. The Congress rejected by considerable majorities resolutions in favour of absolute self-determination ancl in favour of a plebiscite of the Irish people. The passing of the miners&apos; resolution, which may be coupled with the rejection of Mr. Bromley&apos;s amendment to the railwaymen&apos;s resolution, is an indication that the Congress refuse to sit in judgment on the two parties in Ireland, but, having adopted the policy of truce, prefer to secure the adoption of that policy in Ireland by exerting pressure on the British Government alone.The course of action which will be adopted now by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress is not too clear, but it was indicated that the resolutions of the Congress would be put before the Government and that, while the Government considered the resolutions, it would be the duty of every trade union to ballot their members or to take similar steps to ascertain the views of the rank and file on a strike policy. It does not appear that the Parliamentary Committee will assume the responsibility of interpreting these ballots, or any replies the Government may make. There will be yet another Congress to review the situation before any drastic action is-taken.The British Trades Union Congress in their discussion of the Irish question, by taking into consideration all the political factors involved, have failed to decide the question which was the original cause of their meeting, namely, the refusal of some
trade unionists to handle military goods. The Scottish Trades Union Congress,&apos; however, on the 10th July, at Glasgow, called upon the members of the affiliated unions to refuse &quot;to manufacture, handle, or transport munitions or troops&quot; intended for use in Ireland.INDIA.Afghan Delegation [R.E.R., xxi, p. 3J. A telegram from Mr. Dobbs dated 8th July was transmitted [842 S.] by the Viceroy on 10th July, and contained information to the following effect: At the official discussion- held on 8th July, the Afghans put forward-a clause asking for renewal of subsidy and. free grant of material. This was on the ground that they had signed the peace treaty under the impression that the frontier demarcation of last year would be rectified in their favour as regarded the possession of Torkham. As Mr. Dobbs &apos;had been made aware beforehand that the delegates were forced to have an official discussion on this point in order to satisfy Nadir Khan, who averred that his defensive schemes in the neighbourhood of Dakka were useless with Torkham in our possession, the discussion of nearly five hours&apos; duration was merely a put up job.On 15th July the Viceroy transmitted [867 S.] a further telegram from Mr. Dobbs, who related that at the sitting of the. 13th July he had emphasized the grave exception that the Government of India woidd take to any attempt to subsidize Indian Caliphate Committees, of which he had received intimation. Tarsi admitted that some such action had been in contemplation and tried to justify it on the ground, of religious sympathy. Mr. Dobbs thought that his strong expression of opinion would put an end to this matter. At the meeting of 14th July the discussion was devoted to the explanation of our intentions on the lines sanctioned by the Secretary of State. The Afghan delegates expressed themselves as very grateful for the good intentions of the British Government. The formal announcement by Mr. Dobbs of our intention to, build the railway in the Khyber elicited no protest or sign of apprehension. Tarsi officially expressed his strong desire that a definite treaty of friendship might be signed before his return to Kabul, but Mr. Dobbs held out little hope that the Government would approve so great a departure from the policy laid down to be observed by the Conference.The Viceroifs Weekly Reports. The following reports were sent on the 2nd, 10th and (?) 17th July :-I. (2nd July.)-Interest largely centres in the Hunter Report especially in.the expected debate in the Commons and the rumour of General Dyer&apos;s exoneration by the Army Council. The Punjab Trades Association passed a resolution similar to that of the European Association. The Independent (Allahabad) states that Dr. Mani Ram intends to prosecute Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer for the murder of. his son-Marian Mohan, a boy of 12 killed at Jallianwala Bagh, and offers to open a subscription list for the purpose of collecting the necessary funds. The Punjab Government state that the Report continues to be adversely criticized by the educated classes, but that the agitation is likely to receive more attention outside the province than in it. Bombay say that the feeling is deepening.2. The general effect on the public of the Mphamedans&apos; representation and Gandhi&apos;s letter remains to be seen. Raza Ali, a member of the United Provinces Council, has wired that the Shias equally with the Sunnis feel the fate of Turkey and the custody of holy places (?), and therefore Gandhi&apos;s letter deserves careful consideration; non-co-operation as advocated by Gandhi is adversely criticized by the Leader, the Bengalee, the Tribune (Lahore) and the New India on the grounds that failure of the movement will emphasize the inherent weakness of Indians, while success-will lead to chaos and anarchy. The Amritsar Bazaar Patrika considers that the letter is opportune and voices the sentiment of the people. (? Gandhi) now supports Lajpat Rai&apos;s advocacy of an immediate boycott-of the reforms.. United Provinces wire that the people are anxiously waiting to see what action the Government will take on the representations. The Hindus are now actively and openly opposed to non-co-operation, but there is intense agitation over the Caliphate; though Id passed off quietly there is no abatement of Mohamedan feeling. Punjab report Id was everywhere peacefully celebrated.   Prayers were offered in the mosques for the
preservation of the Sultan&apos;s Caliphate and,territories ; collections were made for the-Caliphate cause, and in many places Caliphate agitators endeavoured, with varying success, to persuade the people to abstain from all festivities and to treat the occasion as one of mourning on accoimt of the fate of Turkey. Generally, however, Id was. observed by the Mohamedans of Upper India as a gala day. Violent speeches continue, but there is evidence of the Caliphate agitation decreasing and the extremists becoming more moderate in speech. A more definite lead from1 the Central Caliphate-Committee is wanted before embarking on non-co-operation, in regard to which there is a widening split between Hindus and Mohamedans. At the elections for the-Amritsar municipality, a noteworthy extremist Mohamedan candidate was defeated. There have beeu a few more&apos; emigrants from Punjab to Kabul and fresh names have-been registered. The North-West Frontier Province states that the hijrat movement, is gaining appreciable momentum and may lead to unrest in Peshawar. A report, that 500 emigrants were leaving (? Allahabad) for Peshawar by special train has not. yet been confirmed. The Maharajah of Gwalior, in a recent speech at Gwalior, referring to the Caliphate question, pointed out the folly of creating disturbances and involving dependants in misery by playing into the hands of self-seekers. He-appealed to his subjects to have no concern with any such movement and warned them that the result would be disastrous.Bombay report that Id passed off quietly. The general feeling was one of curiosity as to the reply to gandhis letter and the Mohammedan representations. Gandhi was strenuously endeavouring to win Hindu support by connecting the-Hunter Report with the Caliphate as feeling over the latter was growing. The resolutions at the Scarborough Labour Conference are likely to give a fillip to the-agitation.3. The Government of Bengal are assisting released detenus and political prisoners to settle to peaceful occupations, and for that purpose have already granted Rs. 10,000.Jamshedpur. As the result of a conference of the directors and the management with representatives of labour, further substantial concessions have been announced ; they are final, and conditional on the men accepting them as the maximum grant. They give general satisfaction to the labourers, and the liberal character of the concessions is appreciated.The situation on the North-Western Raihvay is much easier. A few shopmen in Lahore and a few running men are still out, but are gradually returning. The-passenger service is now practically normal.II. (10th July). In Bombay the feeling is growing that the agitation over the Hunter Report should be redoubled in the event of the results of the debate in the-Commons being unsatisfactory. A crowded meeting of protest was held at the end. of June demanding the recall of the Viceroy, the impeachment of Sir M. OMhvyer, and the prosecution of General Dyer. The predominant note, faith in British justice,, is shaken, and the British Parliament is now on its trial.2. The Caliphate agitation is now being associated with the Punjab disturbances,, with a view to the further exploitation of feeling ; the Caliphate agitation in itself is losing force (?). In Bengal, minor meetings of protest continue to be held, chiefly to-raise funds ; but the, leaders would be pleased to find a pretext for withdrawing from the non-co-operation programme. The economic factor overshadows everything else. In Bihar and Orissa there has been an almost complete lull, and an attempt to revive^ interest in the Caliphate at Id fell flat. In the United Provinces feeling in general is less acute; the adherents to the policy of using religious occasions for political purposes are increasing in number. The extremists secured some success by refusing-to say prayers at Id behind title-holders, but there was a poor response to the-&apos; appeal for funds. In the Central Provinces but little enthusiasm was exhibited; Moslems did not rejish being told to obey Gandhi in all things ; the leading maulvi of Jubbulpur, arguing with Shaukat Ali, refused to join in the campaign as being purely political and in no way religious. In Delhi there has been little political action. Recruiting for the police amongst Mohamedans is said to be very good. The Friday-prayers have given a few extremists the means of circumventing the Seditious Meetings Act, and an opportunity of violent speech. Similarly, the Zamindar, a Lahore newspaper, announced that 500 copies has been distributed free to the imams to read out in mosques for the purpose Of spreading the Caliphate propaganda. In the- Forth-West Frontier Province the extremists of Peshawar met with success in the-
collection of subscriptions at Id for the Caliphate Committee and the general wearing of mourning; but elsewhere but little interest was shown. The emigrants to Afghanistan so far number 278, but with few exceptions they are of no substance. Seven mahajarius.were sent back from Afghanistan after being discourteously treated; this will tend to weaken the hijrat movement, though attempts to silence these seven are being made. But there are secret communications between the Caliphate agitators and independent tribes across the border. In Bombay there has been some concentration on the Caliphate campaign; and there have been a few attempts in Sind to depose kazis not supporting the movement. We have just received a report that 1,000 mahajarins have started by special train from Sind for Punjab en route for the frontier; the attitude of Afghanistan towards this invasion will be interesting. Muhammad Ali&apos;s telegram regarding the withdrawal of the Turkish peace terms was published broadcast in Urdu by the Central Caliphate Committee, who have stated in the press that Muhammad Ali should be trusted, and suggested that news is being suppressed by the Government.3. A manifesto has been published by the non-co-operation sub-committee appointed by the Central Caliphate Committee, at its special meeting at Allahabad, indicating the plan of action. The Committee state they want the active co-operation of all in carrying out non-co-operation, and they also desire (corrupt) the sympathy of the whole country, and appeal for help from those who cannot actively participate by-way of contribution to the funds and labour.Should non-co-operation become necessary, the Committee decided to uphold the following part of the first stage, viz.: -(i) The surrender of all titles of honour and honorary offices.(ii) The suspension by lawyers of practice and the settlement of ci vil disputesby private arbitration.(iii) Non-participation in Government loans.(iv) Boycott of Government schools by parents.(v) Boycott of Reformed Councils.(vi) Non-participation in Government parties and similar functions.(vii) Refusal &quot; to accept or to offer as (corrupt)s for, especially in Turkey,the territories now being administered in violation of pledges.(viii) The vigorous prosecution of swadeshi, inducing people to be satisfied withthe country&apos;s own productions and manufactures.People are asked to refrain from taking service either civil or military ; to suspend taking Government loans old or new from now ; and for the rest to remember that non-co-operation does not begin till 1st August. The Committee state that every effort is being made to render non-co-operation unnecessary ; they urge people not to act independently, but in concert with the Committee, rendering strict obedience to its instructions.   Calmness and absolute non-violence are enjoined.The Leader criticizes the first stage of the movement as utterly puerile and ineffectual.There is but little indication of any sort of response to Gandhi&apos;s letter, which has excited amongst moderate Indians ridicule, laughter, and the belief that it is unworthy of serious notice. We doubt very much if many lawyers will give up practice in obedience to the invitation, and their failure in this respect may influence others to refuse to give up service.Election activity continues; Lajpat Rai&apos;s policy of boycott, endorsed by Gandhi, is not generally approved.There is labour unrest in places. Labour strikers are gradually returning to work, and Millefs influence over European employes is declining.Strikes are reported in the Calcutta jute mills; the latest being at the central jute mill at Howrah, where the European assistant was assaulted by weavers, 100 of whom then struck work.III. (? 17th July). The Army Council decision regarding General Dyer has been received unfavourably by the Indian&apos; Press; the criticism being that the question in issue was not whether his action was justified or not, but what punishment he should receive. The decision has nevertheless -relieved the situation, which would have been seriously aggravated &quot;by his exoneration. The English Press also generally criticizes the decisiou adversely on different grounds, though the Statesman says that it should be accepted by all parties as proof of the British sense of justice. The attitude of the Press towards the debate in the House is similarly divided. 18-3 B
The Bombay Chronicle, strenuously contends that the Cabinet decision does not.go far enough and that it is tinged with racial bias. The following is the summary of a speech just made by Lajpat Rai in Simla: He viewed with satisfaction the spirit of democracy that was in the air in the whole country. Last year s episode had woeful tales to tell. &apos; Indian rights were trampled on by foreigners and Indian life was considered worthless. He appealed to the audience to agitate unceasingly until a status equal to that of the Dominions had been secured. Let it be known to the Viceroy, the authorities at home, and the world at large that every inch, every bit of Indian life, be it that of the meanest Indian, was as sacred as that of the highest European in the country. The pledges of British statesmen had no meaning. Turkey was one victim of that. Mr. Montaghs high-sounding principles of Indian government were diplomatic jugglery, and the sooner India knew it the better.-2. GandhPs latest proposal is to boycott the visit of the Prince of Wales under present conditions, on the ground, that royalty is above politics, and therefore Ministers and the Government of India should be prevented, from using His Royal Highness for their own political purposes. &quot; If I can clo nothing else at, least &quot; I must not become a tool in hands of the Ministers and the Government of India, &quot; or allow them to make their hold on India tighter, and demonstrate to the world &quot; that India is happy and contented under this rule.&quot; He would tell Ministers that as Indians want to give the Prince an enthusiastic welcome theyshould remove the Caliphate and Punjab grievances. If they did not, and if they persisted in sending the Prince to India, they would be responsible for placing the. people in the position of having to boycott the visit or the reception. The Ahmedabad branch of the All-India Home Rule League adopted a resolution to this effect,&quot;but the moderates resent &quot; this direct blow at the British Crown and the gross insult to the Prince &quot; (Mrs. Besant).3. Gandhis support of Lajpat Raps determination to boycott the elections caused some difference in extremist circles. Yakub Hassan, writing to Shaukat Ali, says it cuts the ground beneath, the feet of the Caliphate agitators, and will doom non-/ co-operation to failure, and the Punjab-extremists have quarrelled on. this point. The Caliphate agitation, except in the Punjab, where violent speaking is on the increase, and local authorities are much exercised over the general, situation, is comparatively quiet, and the Turkish reply to the Allies passed almost without comment. The extremist leaders are uncertain how to act and are working with little co-operation and practical organizing power. The special session of Congress intended, to be held early in August and advertised for various places (Calcutta, Berhampur, Lahore) is now postponed to) September, and the place of meeting is still uncertain. The Conference of ulema reaffirmed the Central Caliphate Committee^ programme. We have sanctioned the extension of the provisions of the Seditious Meetings Act for a-further period of three months in Delhi, and in view of the results attained we believe this is approved (by) the moderate opinion of the city. The Punjab Government has proposed the extension of the Act to the whole of the Lahore Division, but we deprecate any action under the Act before 1st August, when the non-co-operatiop movement will start according to GandhPs programme.4. In the North-West Frontier Province two bombs were thrown during the week, but no damage was done. 750 mahajarins arrived at Peshawar from Sind by special train. On arrival, they were accorded an ovation and the city was in a state of great excitement, though the situation is well in hand and the leaders are exercising a restraining influence. Special arrangements for the1 onward journey were made. The passage of mahajarins through, the Punjab has had a very disturbing influence, and we propose to arrange for the despatch of further batches by the Indus Valley route, avoiding large cities.5. AVe have issued the following communique denying the allegations of disloyalty of Indian troops in Persia and Constantinople : -Reports have been circulated to the effect that an Indian regiment mutinied . at Constantinople, and. in a recent speech at Paris, Mr. Mohamecl Ali stated that &apos; &quot; already in Persia it is stated, that Indian troops refused to fight.&quot; Enquiries have been made to ascertain whether there is any foundation for the above ; and the General Officer Commanding at Constantinople replied : &quot; Report regarding the mutiny of Indian troops is absolutely without foundation. Far from mutinying, their services in the recent operations have been remarkably good.&quot; The General Officer Commanding in Baghdad has too wired that there is absolutely no truth in the statement or in the report referred to by Mohamecl Ali.
THE DOMINIONS.The Paris Sanitary Convention of 1912. On 10th July the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governors-General of Canada, Australia and South Africa, that the Committee of the International Office of Public Health was likely to consider at the October session the revision of the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1912. The French Government had recently adopted the policy of sending representatives on behalf of all the French Colonies which adhered to the Rome agreement of 1907, and thought it desirable that the British representatives at the October session should be as numerous as possible. Further, it would be of advantage that all the British delegates should have an opportunity of discussing beforehand the policy to be adopted with a view to harmonizing views and avoiding any appearance of conflict of interest between the different parts of the Empire. The Minister of Health accordingly suggested a preliminary meeting of the British delegates here in September. At such a meeting the questions of ships&apos; hygiene and the treatment of venereal disease among sailors, which are also likely to come up in the October session, could be similarly discussed beforehand.Lord Milner asked that he might be informed as to what Governments were likely to be represented at the October session, and as to the possibility &quot;of the representative attending the preliminary meeting.CANADA. .German Consular Representation. On 2nd July the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General saying that it was understood that the French Government proposed to postpone the consideration of the question of the re-establishment of German consuls in France until an agreement was reached with regard to the economic relations of the two countries. Lord Milner asked whether this would affect the attitude of the Canadian Ministry, and added that as1 far as the United Kingdom was concerned it was not proposed to adopt a policy similar1 to that of France.In reply to this the Governor-General reported on 6th July that his Ministers did not propose to adopt a policy similar to that of France, but were prepared to consider immediately arrangements for German consular representation in Canada.- New Cabinet.--On 14th July the Governor-General reported that he had sworn in the following as members of the new administration :  Hon. Arthur Meighen, First Minister and Secretary of State for external affairs. -Right Hon; Sir G. E. Foster, Minister of Trade and Commerce., :  ; Right Hon. A. L. Sifton, Secretary of State and Minister of Mines. Hon J. A. Calder, President of Privy Council and Minister of Immigration andColonization. &apos;     &apos; 18-3 &apos; &apos; .&apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;.     :.   C6. Labour is becoming more (? disseminated) and organized. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway Workmen&apos;s Union, the Bombay Dock Workmen&apos;s Union, and the Bombay United Textile Workmen&apos;s Union have passed resolutions expressing sympathy with the North-Western Railway strikers; condemning thei action of the railway authorities for the dismissal of seven men which led to the strike, and for an alleged breach of faith in observing the agenfs terms which led to a second strike ; urging the Viceroy and Secretary of State to bring about the early end of the strike ; and expressing their willingness to pay one day&apos;s wage as a contribution to the North-Western Railway strikers. They condemned as unconstitutional the nomination by the Government of India of a representative of Indian workers to the International Labour Conference and the Commission of Enquiry, on the ground that this was a direct contravention of the articles of the League of Nations. They further resolved to hold an All-India Trade Union Congress at Bombay next month, and a reception committee, with Mr. Joseph Baptista as Chairman, was appointed. The railway strike at Lahore is reported to be moribund (corrupt group); 7,000 out of 11,000 strikers have drifted back to work in spite of the increasingly violent exhortations of the strike leaders.
Sir Henry Dray ton, Minister of Finance.Bight Hon. C. J. Doherty, Minister of Justice and Attorney-General. hon. J. D. Reid, Minister of Railways and Canals.Sir James Lougheed, Minister of Interior and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs.Hon. P. E. Blondin, Postmaster-General.Hon. C. C. Ballantyne, Minister of Marine aud Fisheries and Naval Service.hon. G. D. Robertson, Minister of Labour.Hon. Hugh Guthrie, Ministry of Militia.Hon. S. F. Tolmie, Minister of Agriculture.Hon. E. W. Wigmore, Minister of Customs and Inland Revenue.Hon. F. B. McCurcly, Minister of Public Works.Ministers without Portfolio: Sir Edward Kemp and Hon. E. K. Spinney.AUSTRALIA.Imperial Naval Defence. On 3rd July the following message from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth was received by the Secretary of State : The Commonwealth Government, having given most serious consideration to defence, finds itself in difficulties. In the first place, Australia is, in common with all other countries, circumscribed by financial considerations. This applies ecpially to military and naval defence schemes. The limitations imposed by finance are, at all events for the time being, insurmountable. But the Commonwealth Government, quite apart from this consideration, finds itself unable to say how moneys available.for naval defence can best be utilized. It is groping in the dark. For example, it does not know whether Britain approves the whole or any part of Lord Jellicoe&apos;s scheme, nor in regard to this or any naval policy has it any information as to the intentions of New Zealand, South Africa or Canada. In the circumstances we feel that we cannot decide in which direction we should move, and should be glad to have the views of the British Government and the Admiralty on the matter. Clearly if the question of the naval defence of the Empire is to be considered next year at the Imperial Conference, the Commonwealth ought not to take such steps in the interim as would or might be inconsistent with such policy. Will you let us know, therefore, the views of the British Government on Imperial defence policy for the Pacific?Commercial Treaties regarding the Pacific. The Governor-General informed the Secretary of State, on 13th July, that the Commonwealth Government desired to be consulted before any commercial treaties giving a right of entry and residence in British possessions in the Pacific were entered into by the British Government, in view of the strategic importance of these possessions for the defence of the Common-wealth, and of the possibility that in preparing plans against the Commonwealth, against which no administrative supervision could be an adequate safeguard, foreign Powers having aggressive designs might seek to make use of them. The Common-wealth Government would be glad to be supplied with lists of the commercial treaties (and of any other treaties giving similar rights to those given by commercial treaties) extending to the various groups.Meat. On 10th July the Governor-General replied to the telegram sent by the Secretary of State on 26th May [13.E.R., xix, p. 10], saying that his Government had communicated with all the State Governments concerned, as well as with producers and exporters. Queensland was willing to accept the proposal that the contract should expire on 30th November, but preferred 31st December, as the current season there does not extend beyond 30th November. All concerned in that State desired that sufficient tonnage for meat and by-products should be allotted to keep the works clear. The Government of Queensland definitely concurred in the fore--going. As regards the Southern States, the parties concerned could not agree, therefore the Government of the Commonwealth suggested that His Majesty&apos;s. Government should itself fix the date of the contract.NEW ZEALAND.Deportation of Germans from Samoa. On 8th July the Officer Administering the Government telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State in reply to his
message of 30th June iu. regard to the deportation of Germans from Samoa: -The Government of New Zealand as a matter of public policy decided last December, in anticipation of the ratification of the Treaty of Peace, to repatriate all full-blooded German nationals resident in Western Samoa who were without Samoa:! native family ties, but were unable to give earlier effect to this policy of repatriation owing to the difficulty of securing transport. This transport did not become available until 16th June 1920, when the embarkation took place. Included among the persons repatriated were, firstly, Germans who had been interned in New Zealand during the war period, and who had been permitted to rejoin their families in Samoa pending the provision of transport to Germany, and secondly/ Germans who had expressed a wish to be returned to Germany. There were exempted from the repatriation order several elderly Germans whose health it was considered would be prejudicially affected by the change to a European climate after long residence in the tropics.Telegraphing again on 13th July he said that although the general policy was to repatriate all full-blooded Germans who were without Samoan family ties, as a matter of fact individual cases had been considered and decided in accordance with particular circumstances, such as domestic affairs, age, physical disability, length of tropical residence. The steamship Main had embarked 779 deportees and 11 German and Austrian passengers who desired to be repatriated.Re-establishment of German Consulates [B.E.R., xxi, p. 13]. In reply to the message from the Secretary of State, the Officer Administering the Government of New Zealand telegraphed on 17th July that the Government of New Zealand concurred in the proposals.Wool. On 13th July the Officer Administering the Government reported that the terms proposed for the payment of the share of profits derived from wool up to 31st March 1919 to New Zealand producers were acceptable to the Government, of New Zealand ; and that that Government noted with satisfaction that effect would be given to the arrangements which were made between the Minister of Munitions and the Prime Minister of New Zealand regarding the share of profits on the last twoclips-to be paid to New Zealand.
