CANADA.Representation of Canada at Washington. On 3rd October the Duke of Devon-shire, Governor-General of Canada, telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : &quot; My advisers have arrived at the conclusion that the distinctive representation of Canada at Washington should be delayed no longer, and they refer to the correspondence which has taken place since 13th October 1917. If my advisers are correctly informed, the consideration of questions between the United States and Canada and the necessary action thereon constituted two-thirds or three-quarters of the work at the Embassy prior to the war. After the conclusion of Peace the same condition will probably arise ; in most cases these questions concern purely Canadian interests and often they were approached without the exact, information, which should have been available. The selection of the personnel of the Embassy&apos;s staff has always been without consultation with the Government of Canada, and apparently with no special regard to (? their) acquaintance with Canadian interests or conditions. A strong feeling has thus arisen in this country that effective steps should be taken to safeguard more thoroughly Canadian interests in Washington. The two countries adjoin upon a boundary line nearly 4,000 miles in length, and commercial and. social intercourse are increasing constantly. My advisers refer as an. illustration to trade conditions during the live years&apos; periods from 1900 to 1919 inclusive. During the first period the total trade between the United Kingdom and Canada, was $836,000,000, between the United. States and Canada $932,000,000, and between all the South American countries and the United States $765,000,000. Corresponding figures in the second period were $1,967,000,000, $1,262,000,000, and $1,114,000,000. &quot; Figures in the third period were $432,000,000, $2,318,000,000, and $1,639,000,000. The figures in the fourth period were $3,273,000,000, $4,483,000,000, and $3,585,000,000. The total trade between the United States and Canada exceeds, it will be observed, that of the United States and all the South American countries, and also by a considerable margin it exceeds the total trade between the United Kingdom and Canada. Having regard to these facts, my advisers have no doubt as to the necessity for distinctive representation. They are desirous of accomplishing it upon lines which will maintain and even emphasize the solidarity of the Empire, but which give to this country the distinctive representation which constitutional development in recent years both (?) sanctions and demands. They therefore propose that such representation should be established upon the. following lines, which express conclusions to be embodied in an Order in Council: &quot; &quot;I. The Dominion of Canada shall be represented by a diplomatic agent in the United States, duly accredited to the President of the United States, to reside at Washington in the character of an Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for Canada. ;&apos; 2. The Canadian Minister shall be appointed by and be directly responsible to the Canadian Government. He shall receive his instructions from and shall report to the.Secretary of State for External Affairs. &quot; 3. Subject to an agreement to be made with the United States Government, the Canadian diplomatic establishment at Washington under the direction of the Canadian Minister shall constitute a part of the establishment of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy.&quot;4. In matters between the United States and. His Majesty in respect of the Dominion of Canada, the Canadian Minister shall, conduct negotiations and be the channel of communication at Washington.&quot; 5. In all matters between His Majesty&apos;s Embassy and -the Canadian Govern-rnent, the Canadian Minister shall hereafter be the channel of com-munication.&quot; 6. With the object of promoting the most complete co-operation and unity of purpose, effective arrangements to be agreed upon between the Canadian Minister and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador shall be made for the continuous consultation in all (? important) matters of common concern and for such necessary concerted action (group undecypherable) consultation as they
oOmay determine.   They shall refer to their respective Governments for thesettlement of any matter which they may he unable to adjust by con-sultation between themselves. &quot; 7. In particular, such forms and mode of procedure shall be agreed upon aswill prevent embarrassment or confusion on the part of the UnitedbStatesGovernment in respect of the channel of (?) subsequent communications. &quot; 8. Further negotiations at Washington in regard to matters now pendingbetween the United States and Canada shall be conducted by and throughthe Canadian Minister,&quot; The matter is somewhat urgent as the Canadian War Mission at Washington has been practically closed. My advisers hope that they may be favoured with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government with as little delay as possible.&quot;War Pensions. Evidence given before the Canadian House of Commons Committee on Soldiers&apos; Civil Ue-establishment has shown that Canada is now paying war pensions to 90,000 persons, the amounts paid amounting to $28,000,000 annually; that the war gratuities will probably reach between $120,000,000 and $125,000,000; and that the Soldiers&apos; Land Settlement Scheme will place 50,000 ex-soldiers on farms with advances which will amount to $150,000,000.Shipbuilding.-During the first seven months of the present year 45 vessels were built in British Columbia shipbuilding yards, that is almost as many as were turned out during the whole of 1918. The ships which have been built are valued at $24,000,000.Minister of Finance and Parliament. ;The Canadian Minister of Finance, Sir Henry Dray-toft; will be elected without opposition to the House of Commons for Kingston owing to the withdrawal of the Liberal and Labour candidates.Grand Trunk Pacific-It is expected that the Parliamentary Session will continue in order that legislation may be passed to deal with the Grand Trunk Railway negotiations. The resolution introduced by the Minister of Railways in the House of Commons provides for the acquisition of the whole of the Company&apos;s capital stock, with the exception of the present 4 per cent, guaranteed stock amounting to $12,500,000.Prohibition. A Bill introduced into the House of Commons by the Minister of Justice last week to amend the Temperance Act provides that where the majority of electors in any province declare themselves in favour of the prohibition of the importation or manufacture of alcoholic liquors in the &quot;province- such importation or manufacture will be prohibited by proclamation.Land Settlement. It is announced that the Soldiers&apos; Settlement Board will send a Qualification Committee to Groat Britain in January for the purpose of selecting veterans of the Imperial forces for settlement in Canada. It will hold sittings in various parts of England and Scotland, and the men accepted will be given certificates entitling them to proceed to Canada to receive agricultural training and to participate in the benefits of the scheme.Unionists and Sir Robert Borden.. At a caucus meeting of the followers of the Government it was decided to continue the Unionist Government for the remainder of the parliamentary term, and unanimous support of Sir Robert Borden was agreed upon during the period of reconstruction.Sir Edward Kemp. Mi&apos;. Lloyd George sent the following wireless message to Sir Edward Kemp, the Minister of the Canadian Overseas Military Forces, as he was returning to Canada on the S.S. Mauretania : &quot; Many thanks for your letter of 18th September. Your remarks as to the cordial relations which have existed between yourself and. the members of the Canadian Headquarters Staff in London and the different branches of the Imperial Government are very gratifying. I wish to thank both you yourself and the Canadian Head-quarters Staff in London for the unvarying courtesy and&apos;consideration which has done so much to promote these happy relations. I warmly reciprocate your hopes that the bonds which bind Canada to the Mother Country may always prove as strong in the future as during the last five years. In thanking you for your kind personal sentiments to me let me wish you a safe and pleasant voyage.&quot;
AUSTRALIA.Alteration of the Constitution. On 7th October the Governor-General off the Commonwealth of Australia telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as--follows : &quot; The House of Representatives has passed without amendment the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Rowers) Bill introduced on 1st October, and the Constitution Alteration (Nationalisation of Monopolies) Bill introduced on 2nd October ; bothshad been made urgent and. a time limit for discussion fixed. The first covers the provision of trade and commerce, corporation, industrial matters, and Trust Bill of 1915-(referenda in respect of which was not taken) with the variation that the section relating to trade and commerce specifically excludes the railways of States. The proposal made in 1915 that the Commonwealth shpiild be enabled to deal with disputes on State railways&apos;was omitted. The Monopolies Bill differs from the 1915 Bill in the following respects : (1) Provision is made for the acquisition of the &quot;assets and goodwill of instead&apos;of &quot;property used in connection with industry or business &apos;.; (2) any declaration by each House of Parliament that any industry or business is a subject of monopoly is to be preceded by a reference made by each House in the same session, by a resolution passed by an absolute majority, to the High Court iov ail enquiry and report by Justice on the question whether the industry or business-is the subject of a monopoly. Each- Bill limits the effect of the alteration provided for in it to (a) the expiration of three years from assent; or (b) till a convention constituted by the Commonwealth makes a recommendation for the alteration of&apos; the constitution and the people endorse whichever first happens, with the proviso that if no convention be constituted before 31st December 1920 the alterations then cease to have effect,&quot;Federal Labour Party. The Premier of Queensland, Mr. Ryan, has been appointed the director of the Federal Labour campaign. The Labour Party iiiflend to oppose the referendum proposed &quot;by Mr. Hughes to deal with profiteering.Approval of Treaties. Two telegrams from Sir Ronald Munro-Ferguson, Governor-General, were received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies&apos; on 3rd October, the first informing him that the treaty of the peace with Germany &apos;and the other that the Angle-French Treaty had been approved,by both Houses o:&apos; the Commonwealth Parliament. &apos;;Commonwealth Elections. The Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes, has announced that the Federal elections will probably be held on 13th December.NEW ZEALAND.IChinese Labour for Samoa [&quot; British Empire Report &quot; No. 1, page 3]. On 26th September Lord Milner telegraphed to the Governor-General of New Zealand as follows :  ,-&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking has telegraphed that the coolies would have to be recruited in the South as the Northern Chinese are quite unsuited to the climate of Samoa, but that the South is still outside the control of the Peking Government. The only means he can suggest is to come to an agreement with the local authorities&apos; of Canton. He has sounded these on the subject and they state that until they receive report on Chinese labour in Samoa from their Consul there, with whom they are trying to communicate by telegraph, they cannot give a definite reply. He suggests that your Government should also approach the Consul with an explanation of the terms offered.&quot; !Governments Election Programme [&quot;British Empire and Africa Report,&quot; No. cxxxiv, p. 4]. The Prime Minister has announced the Governments election pro-gramme, and the published statement indicates that Mr. Massey opposes the reversion to political control of the public services-, expresses an open mind in regard to the nationalization of coat mines, and deprecates an attempt to return to the &quot;old demoralizing party system.&quot;
Legislative Council. A declaration having been made by the Dominion Legislative Council that the introduction of any measure affecting the constitution of the Council before presentation to the Council was a breach of the Oouncil&apos;s privileges, it proceeded to pass the Womehs Parliamentary Rights&apos;Bill, eliminating those portions relating to the Council.Samoa and a Mandate. On 30th September Lord Milner received the following telegram from Lord Liverpool, Governor-General of New Zealand : &quot;A Bill will bo immediately introduced into the New Zealand Parliament for the acceptance of any mandate which may be conferred for the Government of the Sanioau Islands. The Government of New Zealand desires the Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to provide,that full jurisdiction over the Samoan Islands may be exercised by the Governor-General in Council till the New Zealand Parliament makes other provision for that purpose.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.Political Parties.-Reuter&apos;s,agent telegraphed from Cape Town on 3rd October as follows :--&quot; General Smuts, having completed his tour of the Western districts of the Cape Province, attended the Cape Provincial Congress of the South African Party held at Paarl, where interest centred on the question of reunion with the Nationalists, the latter holding a similar congress a few hundred yards away with a view to a rapprochement. General Smuts reiterated the three points on which a reunion was&apos; possible, as enunciated in his speech on 17th September, at the special session of Parliament, and demanded a clear statement as to whether the Nationalists intended to abide by the British connexion or not. Mr. Malan, while endorsing the statements of General Smuts, advocated the appointment of delegates to meet, delegates from the Nationalist Congress, on the ground that no harm could come from a hearing of the latteFs views. The delegates vyere subsequently appointed. The Nationalist Con-gress adopted, as far as the Cape Province is concerned, an amended programme of principles embodying a lengthy clause dealing with the British connexion. This clause lays down that the existing relationship between the Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom, is recognized, but the ultimate destiny and aim. of the people of the Union must be full freedom and sovereign independence. The Party therefore declares itself opposed to any policy of closing the door against attaining this aim.&quot;Telegraphing again on the following day he said that the negotiations at Paarl between the delegates of the South African Party and the Nationalists, with a view to a rapprochement had not succeeded in removing the radical difference in regard to the Nationalist ideal of complete independence. Nevertheless, a Nationalist delegate when addressing the Nationalist Congress at Paarl had expressed the opinion that the door to reunion would not be closed.. The Transvaal and the Free .State. Renter s agent telegraphing from Pretoria on 3rd October reported that the Nationalist deputation had published a lengthy rejoinder to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s reply to them in his interview with General Ifertzog in Paris on 5th June, particularly with reference to the deputation^ claim for the restitution of independence to the Transvaal and the Free State. Against Mr, Lloyd George&apos;s argument that the deputation represented only a party, and not even the whole of the Dutch-speaking people of those provinces, it is contended that all that could be expected from the deputation was to show that the majority of those who had been despoiled desired the,restoration of their independence. Such a majority, the deputation felt, they represented, and, if doubt was felt regarding it, they asked that appropriate steps should be taken to ascertain the wishes of those concerned. Jt was further argued that the Transvaal and the Free State by entering the Union had not renounced their claim to restitution and independence, but had no option between independence and the Union.Lord Euxton&apos;8 Tour in the South-West Protectorate.

Madras (incomplete figures): works, 54,262; gratuitous, 91,265.Telegraphing again on 10th October, he reported as-follows :  Relief operations in the United Provinces and in the Amraoti District of the Central Provinces and gratuitous relief in the Jubblepore, Damoh, and Mandia Districts of the latter Province have been closed. In Hyderabad prospects are now hopeful, and the number of persons, on relief works is decreasing. Numbers relieved :--Bengal (incomplete figures): gratuitous, 6,155. Bihar and Orissa : works, 3,796; gratuitous, 52,695. Feudatory States of Orissa: works, 6,806; gratuitous, .... Central India: works, 3,300; gratuitous, 8,000. Central Provinces: works, 19,34-3; gratuitous, 5,444. Bombay: works, 3,550; gratuitous, 20,658. Hyderabad: works, 19,000; gratuitous, 32,000. Madras: works, 59,088; gratuitous (incomplete figures), 70,625.The Crops. On 3rd October the Viceroy reported that a cyclone had passed over the district of the Dacca Division and Khulna in Bengal on 24th September, and. had caused great damage to the crops and livestock. Elsewhere the crops generally were doing well.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;o.EGYPT.Italy and the British Protectorate. Telegraphing from Rome on 6th October [No. 635] Sir Renuell Rodd reported as follows : &quot;I have spoken, recently to the- President of the Council and to-day to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on my own initiative, pretexting the proximate departure of the Commission, about the delay in recognition by Italy of the British protectorate in Egypt.&quot; The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me that it was his intention to announce Italian recognition very shortly, taking the first opportunity to do so (group omitted) exchange of letters embodying arraugeihents he had concluded, with Lord Milner on African questions. He would have one or two desiderata to express on behalf of Italian subjects.&quot;1 reminded him that when-the analogous question arose of our recognizing the annexation of Tripoli, we had considered the question of stipulating certain conditions for British subjects, but had renounced any such intention and accorded unconditional recognition, and it was understood that when the time came for modifying the capitulations in Egypt the Italian Government would act similarly.&quot; The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had never contemplated making conditions.   The most he would do would be to express a pious hope.&quot;Trade Unions. Telegraphing from Cairo on 6th October [No. 1446], Sir Milne Oheetliam reported that the idea that higher wages could be obtained by forming unions was being propagated amongst all classes of labour by political agitators. The unions were practically all managed-by lawyers whose object was to be in a position to use the men when the extremists wanted to put pressure on the Govem-ment. It was an open question, whether many of these organizations would hold together without the stimulus of the extremists together with that of foreign agencies and money.
2- 30-,ADEN.- : Colonel JacoVs Mission. On 27 th September the. Resident at Aden reported [telegram, ^unnumbered] on the authority of letters received from,Colonel Jacqb&apos;s Mission, that the ex-Vali had arrived at Bajil on 19th September. Saved Abdul. Quadir of-Marawa had given the guarantee On the strength of which he had been permitted to, visit Bajil.Colonel Jacob had received a letter from the Zaraniq (over the seal of Shaykh Maruf Mawaslia), accusing him of deceit and prevarication, and asserting that our object in sitting at Hodeidah was to interfere in matters which did not concern us and to seize the country. They demanded the removal of the present Political Officer at Hodeidah and the evacuation of that place, together with the opening up of land (? routes) to trade. The Quhra also demanded the evacuation of Hodeidah, and the establishment of free trade bj-land and sea.r   The Resident added that he had again proclaimed in Aden, that there were no restrictions on the sailing of dhows.Telegraphing again on 3rd October [no number] he reported the receipt ,of a communication from Colonel Jacob to the following effect: Mahmud Nedim, the ex-Vali, had, with their consent, taken over the negotiations from the Quhra. He was the Imam&apos;s representative, but feared his niaster&apos;s ambitious aims, the subjugation by force of all Yemen. He was averse to taking over Hodeiclah himself as he was shorn &apos; of military backing, and. he deprecated that place being occupied by Idrisi.The Quhra programme, Colonel Jacob said, was that the British should evacuate Hodeidah and a Turkish garrison take possession. This was clue to their fear of the Imam.Telegraphing again on 6th October [unnumbered] the Resident transmitted a message, dated 4th October, received from Colonel Jacob in the course of which the latter intimated that he was still opposed to the return of Turkish troops.Telegraphing again on 13th October [unnumbered], the Resident transmitted a message, dated 5th October, from Colonel Jacob, in the course of Which the latter said that they Avere prevented from returning to Hodeidah pending receipt of orders as to the temporary garrisoning of that place by the Turks. Should the Governments reply be in the negative and the Imam become [? aggressive] he wanted, he said, to be in a position to assure the Shafeis that his Government would support them against an unprovoked Zeidi invasion. Failing this promise, the return to Hodeidah could only be effected, by a show of force, as the Quhras feared that the Imam would attack directly the Mission had retired to Hodeidah. An attack by the Imam on the Quhras. after the liberation of the Mission had not been vetoed by the Government, but he, Colonel Jacob, deprecated acquiescence in such an attack.
LORD BUXTONS- TOUR OF THE SOUTH-WEST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.(1) Speech at Windb.uk.At the capitalbf the new territory on 2nd October Lord Buxton, Governor-General&apos; of the Union, delivered an important and what will probably be an historical pro-pronouncement on the status and administration, of the South-West Protectorate which was formerly German Sonth-West Africa and which has now been wedded to the Union under marriage lines from the League of Nations. In His ExceUency&apos;8 words &quot; South-West Africa will, I can safely assume, for better or worse, for richer for; poorer, for ever and aye, form an integral portion, of the Union.&quot; Windhuk gave-&quot;their Excellencies a most cordial reception and a great throng of townspeople cheered them heartily on their arrival. Two hundred British school children sang the National Anthem and bugles sounded the Royal Salute. The spectacle was enhanced by ai fine turn out of the officers and men of the garrison, while the vivid colours and quaintly fashioned dresses of the native women on the line of route caught the eye.; There was a dignified and most impressive scene in the Ratsaal where the Governor-General delivered a speech, in the presence of many ladies and representatives-of the British garrison and community and quite a large number of the German community.His Excellency said they would all realize the somewhat delicate position in which he was placed in making his first speech as Governor-General of the Union-after the decision of the Union Parliament to accept the mandate for South-West Africa which meant practically the transference of this country to the Union as an integral portion of its territory, hie was very glad his first speech at Windhuk came-when the ratification of the Peace Treaty which would finally end the great and terrible- war was about to take place. His Excellency, after some observations on the-liew outlook and a reference to his visit to the sand belt in the South during the -campaign, said, he was glad indeed&apos;.that his second visit was an errand of peace instead of a mission of war.Lord Buxton then outlined the position of the territory, and, paying a tribute, to-the administrative work carried on by the officials of the Union since the surrender of the German forces, emphasized that the territory had been fortunate in having men like Sir Howard Gorges, Colonel de Jager,; Major Herbst and others who had done their best to administer the country with due consideration.for the feelings of the-German population. (Applause.) Referring to the future, the Governor-General said the German settlers would wish him to speak frankly and definitely. He laid down three main premises : &quot; Firstly, in no circumstances would the country be handed back to Germany ; secondly, the territory would in future form an integral portion of the Union ; and thirdly, whatever might be the final constitution of the-League of Nations, however international it might be, and whether Germany were represented on it or not, neither of the above premises would be open to reconsideration. They had been irrevocably settled by the Peace Treaty.&quot;On the first point the Peace Conference unanimously and without hesitation had decided definitely and decisively that in no circumstances would any German -Colonies be returned to Germany. Further, Germany had, solemnly renounced ail her rights and titles over her overseas possessions and had placed her signature to this renunciation.Lord Buxton then clearly and forcibly explained the character of the mandate,, emphasizing especially the protection it guaranteed to the natives, and continued with a firm, and &quot;definite declaration that the territory was to-day part and parcel of the Union, and the acceptance by the Union of the mandate was clear and unequivocal. Even suppose, the Governor said, that the Union Government changed its mind and decided that the South-West Territory should be severed from the Union, it could not, even-if it should so desire, hand back the territory to Germany-,.but,would have to hand it back to the League of Nations, and the League would then either have to-find another Allied State willing to act as mandatory or itself administer the territory, He thought, however,, that for reasons of contiguity as well as for economic and.
commercial reasons, the Union would he preferred as a mandatory to any of the . Allies.Dealing with the subject of future citizenship, His Excellency asked to what extent the non-British elements were entitled to become British subjects and to what extent and when they would be entitled to franchise rights and representation in the Union Parliament. He affirmed that the time had been too short to enable the League of Nations or those interested to arrive at a final conclusion, and the question must be decided at leisure. But that could not in the slightest degree affect the position of the territory as regarded the Union. &quot; Therefore,&quot; continued Lord. Buxton, &quot; South-West Africa for better for worse, for richer for poorer, for ever and1 aye will form an integral portion of the Union.   The Union is bound up with the&apos; future of the territory, and the future of the territory is bound up with that o f the; Union.&quot; &apos;The Governor-General next turned to the relations between the territory and. the, Union, and pointed out that it was for those who were formerly citizens of the German Empire to decide their course of action. If, after consideration, they desired to identify themselves with the Uniou the door was open wide to them, and. pre-sumably they might look, in time, to obtain full citizenship and a share of that self-government which was the pride of the white population of the British Empire, lie went on to say that it was useless to disguise the fact that the war had produced the bitterest feelings. &quot; I do not wish,&quot; Lord Buxton said, &quot;to embitter them further by dwelling on the reasons which have caused such intensity of feeling amongst the Allies. The Germans here naturally have their own feelings and we have ours. Neither side can yet awhile forget and forgive all; but time is a great healer, and it&apos; will be felt by all sections of the Union that you, as German settlers, and they, as, citizens of the Union, have got to live together, and with give-and-take there will be&apos;a gradual softening of the past on both sides. The administration during the past three or four years has been under martial law, and it will be admitted that it was carried out with tact, patience and forbearance.   I am confident,&quot; he continued,&quot;&apos;. that 1 am expressing the desires of the citizens of the Union when I say that they are as anxious as the German community here that the period of martial law shouldbome to an end. as soon as possible, and its place be taken by the ordinary civil administration of the Union.   How soon this maybe feasible I cannot say.   Moreover,-certain questions, economic and financial, depend partly for their decision here and elsewhere upon the final settlement between the Allies and Germany, but when the change from martial law to ordinary civil administration does take place-and I hope&apos;it may be soon the main disabilities and. restraints which have been dwelt on by the deputations I have seen, but which are Inseparable from the conditions prevailing&quot;during the last four years, will disappear, la substance the future administration will be very similar to that of the last few years.&quot; . .Speaking on the subject of Europeans and natives, Lord Buxton said he desired to emphasize one point, namely, that the administration would be based on the principle that Europeans, natives and coloured races, were equally entitled to receive and would receive even-handed justice. The administration would not tolerate any harsh treatment of natives, and would make no distinction between black and white where an offence&quot;was committed. The courts alone would mete out punishment. In person the natives, and especially women, would be protected from violence or assault.   No chaining or1 putting in irons would be allowed. No flogging would be authorised except by a magistrate or superior judicial court. No conviction would take place without proper evidence being tendered.   In gaols chaining had already ceased.On the other hand, the natives must understand that it was incumbent upou them to carry out their services in a proper manner to the best of their ability, to be obedient and respectful and not to bring trivial complaints against their employers. If there were any among the natives who considered their liberty under restraint or their dignity curtailed, then for their own sake and for that of the territory let them seek another clime where they might hope to exercise unchecked their own sweet will. His Excellency declared he was confident that the Union was not taking over South-West Africa light-heartedly, and realized to the full its responsibilities and obligations. The future of the German population was largely in their own hands, and they must decide whether they would honestly,.freely,, and sincerely.throw in. their lot with the citizens of the Union, and be ready to work and. live side by - side with them on amicable and friendly terms for the common good of the territory, or whether they meant to remain outside as a foreign element. &apos;&apos;Ihave spoken frankly and in all friendliness,&quot; he said, &quot;and I trust that in any case all will appreciate and reciprocate
the spirit in which I have spoken. I feel sure that South-West Africa, if well administered and if the administration be accepted in a friendly spirit, will form a prosperous and law-abiding portion of the great self-governing Dominion of South Africa.&quot;   (Loud and prolonged applause.)(2) Enthusiastic! Welcome at Keetmanshoop.The. people of Keetmanshoop gave Lord and Lady Buxtou an enthusiastic welcome on their arrival on 1st October.Their Excellencies were received by the townspeople in the public park which was gaily decorated with flags in honour of the occasion. The British community, in which the Dutch element was preponderant, presented most cordial addresses of welcome. Some German settlers also attended the proceedings, the most memorable feature of which, however, was a gathering of Hottentots and Herreros, who had been unable to hold friendly meetings during the German regime.The natives greeted Lord Buxton with great shouts of welcome and played a quaint native version of the National Anthem. The Hottentot Chiefs, Goliath and Henclrik, asked His Excellency to tell the King that they wished to live under British rule. Their people, they declared, had suffered under the Germans, but they were now being well treated. A giant Berrero spokesman said that the Herreros had had no abode owing to the Germans, but they now looked forward to a bright future.His Excellency in reply said that he was very glad that the natives desired to come under the protection of the King, and that as Governor-General of the Union of South Africa he could count on their loyalty.-Replying to a question of the Chief, hlendrik, Lord Buxton said he was confident that they would enjoy their tribal rites and customs under the future Government of the country.   The gathering then cordially cheered Lord Buxton.
