THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.        CLEARING AND COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS WITH ITALY.       Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     I think ray colleagues will be interested to have somedetails as to the Clearing Agreement and the commercial agreement concluded with the Italian Government in Rome on the6th November.     The Clearing Agreement provides that all debts in respectof the price of Italian goods imported into the United kingdom shall continue to be paid to the Anglo-Italian Clearing Office.     For payments in respect of current trade with Italy the clearing Office will provide 50 per cent, of the sterling sums which they have already collected and placed to reserve underthe Treasury Order of the 10th July, 1S36, and 70 per cent,  oftheir total current receipts.   This provision covers payments for goods of United Kingdom origin imported into Italy and freight for goods carried between the two countries in british ships.     Liquidation of commercial frozen debts will be effectedthrough arrears accounts which will receive 27 per cent, ofthe current receipts of the Clearing Office, as well as45 per cent, of the sterling already collected by the ClearingOffice under the Treasury Order of the 10th July, 1936, and90 per cent, of any sterling balance availaule and notrequired for current trade at the end of each quarter.     The balance of the sums available for distribution by the clearing Office will be used for financial payments due to united Kingdom beneficiaries.     The debtor in Italy is responsible for the payment of sterling debts to the creditor in the United Kingdom up to the secret.COPY NO.40C.P.304  (36)CABINET.
full sterling amount clue,  except as regards the arrears incertain cases where the debtor,  by paying a deposit in lire,has received a full diecrrrge under an Italian Decree of the20th November, 193-5.   In these  cases,  the lire sums depositedin respect of sterling debts will be re-converted into sterlingby the Italian authorities and win be paid in sterling at the fixed rate of 64.46 lire to the  pound,  i.e.  at the rate priorto the devaluation.     Debts due to Hewfoundland for codfish imported into Italyare provided for in the same manner as cnebts due to theUnited Kingdom.     The amount of the commercial arrears due to this country has not been precisely ascertained, hut is believed to be inthe neighbourhood of  21 million.   The period within whichthese arrears will be liquidated under the Agreement depends upon the future volume of trade  between the two countries, andit is therefore not possible to  estimate with any certaintyhow long it will take to clear off the arrears, but it is hopedthat they will be liquidated in  about two years.     Under the Commercial Agreement the Italian Governmentundertake, in effect, that they  will authorise imports into italy of United Kingdom goods and codfish from Newfomidland toa total quarterly value of lire  97 million,  i.e. (when allowance has been made for the  devaluation) not quite two-fiftjisof the corresponding Italian imports in 1934.   Restriction of current trade to this level has  been arranged in order toensure that there will not be any fresh accumulation ofuntrausferred arrears.   ?or coal and coke the quarterly quotawill be lire 43.5 million, which is estimated to be roughlyequivalent to between 450,000 and 500,000 metric tons asagainst an average of 1,180,000  tens in each quarter of 1934.
                                                         Id     The Agreements will come into force on the 16th November,1936, and will continue in force until the 30th June, 1937,  and thereafter from quarter to quarter.    Payments for imports from italy will continue to he made to the Clearing Office so longas any of the commercial payments covered by the ClearingAgreement remain untrausferred to United Kingdom creditors.     The negotiations were long and  difficult, but I hope thatthe Agreements now reached will enable the trade between thetwo countries to be re-established on a basis which will promote a progressive return to normal conditions.
