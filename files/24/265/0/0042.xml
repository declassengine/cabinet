THE PROBLEM    1. The Cabinet will be aware  that the difficulty of obtaining recruits  for the    ^Regular Army and tbe Territorial Army has for some time been a source of acute and  Qeneraiincreasing anxiety.   This is not  merely a matter of domestic concern.  As the figuresof recruitment in this country become known those nations in Europe who rely upon our support  are  alarmed,  while those who hope that  our  strength is graduallydecaying find grounds for encouragement.   During the long years of trade depression,when it was to be expected  that a larger number  of recruits  would be forthcoming,the difficulty has not diminished, and now when the need  for men is more urgent, theprospects of alternative employment for all able-bodied men of military age are morefavourable than they have been at any period since the War.    2. Although this circumstance increases our present  difficulties it should  not beimagined  that  the  problem  itself is an  ephemeral  one dependent on  the existingemergency and likely to  disappear if any improvement in the international situationor deterioration in industrial conditions were to come  about.   Our present militaryestablishment  is  not really sufficient for  the proper  performance of our Imperialresponsibilities.  The system is based  upon the  principle  of retaining at home one battalion for every battalion serving overseas.  Therefore, the number of battalions athome should correspond with the number abroad, without allowing for the Brigade ofGuards, who  are sent  abroad  only in exceptional  circumstances.  At  the  presentmoment there are 86 battalions abroad as against 40 at home.   This excess of  foreign service is naturally unpopular and does much to discourage recruiting.  The events ofthe last twelve months have not,  of course, been normal but we have unfortunately no grounds for believing that similar events are unlikely  to take place in  the years thatlie ahead.  From a military point of view it was extremely fortunate  that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute was liquidated before it became necessary to  reinforce the garrison of Palestine.   The margin  of time was very narrow.  If the two  emergencies  hadcoincided, and  if India,  instead of being able to supply reinforcements, had beendemanding them a  not impossible  contingency the  situation would have been serious.    3. Taking, therefore, the most optimistic view of possible developments, it wouldbe folly to expect any future reduction  of our military establishment.  The position with regard to that establishment at present is as follows.    4. On 1st  April,  1934, the deficit,  that  is to  say, the difference betweenstrength and establishment, was  3,742.  On the  same date in  1936 the deficit  was10,074, and if recruiting does not  deteriorate it is estimated  that the deficit in 1938will be 20,300 and in 1940 it will be 31,000.  If these  estimates  prove  correct theeffect  will  be  that  in 1938 drafts will be found only by reducing  home units tocadre.   By 1939 it is doubtful  if full drafting will be possible and by 1940 we shallbe unable to  supply drafts for  garrisons abroad.   This means that at a time when
our rearmament  programme will be, it  is hoped, approaching completion, our militarysystem will break down.  We shall no longer have the troops available for the policingof the British Empire.     5. These figures  reveal a  situation which it would not be an  exaggeration to describe as appalling, and the need for immediate and  drastic steps to remedy it mustbe apparent to all.     G. It will be well in  the first  place to diagnose  the causes which are responsiblefor the disease, and  if these causes  prove to be endemic and neither temporary norfortuitous then  the treatment  must be fundamental and  calculated  to  provide a lasting cure.     7. The Army has at no period been a popular calling among the English people.Except during the later stages  of the last war Great Britain has  never been in aposition to put a  large army into the field, and our small mercenary armies of thepast were principally composed of men without either education or ambition.   Whenthey were not upon  the  parade  ground they were to be found in the canteen or thepublic house.  It  is to the credit of popular education, and other social reforms, thatthis  type of man has very largely ceased  to exist, and it is to the credit of the Armythat survivors of this type  are  no longer  welcome additions  to  its ranks.   Anotheruseful recruiting agent was physical  hunger.  The Labour Party  are still occasionallytempted to make use of the phrase &quot;  the conscription of hunger,&quot; but it has  ceased tohave  any meaning.  The Adjutant-General recently  interviewed a  large number ofthe &quot;A&quot; reservists  who had been called up to go to Palestine.   The only one whocomplained and said that  he would sooner remain at home was living on the dole.     8. While there  has  been a  steady improvement  in  the standard of living of theBritish people during the last half century, there has   been very little improvement inthe conditions which the Army has been able to offer to recruits.  Housing conditions have made great advances  during that period,  but, owing to the  necessity of keepingArmy Estimates as low as  possible, the Military Members of the Army Council haverightly insisted on the available  funds being expended upon  military purposes, withthe result that the  housing  conditions of the Army have hardly improved at all, if infact they have not  deteriorated owing to the inevitable process of wear and tear.     9. Another  reason why we  cannot fill our ranks is that the physical standard ofmen presenting themselves  is too low.  It is obviously uneconomical to take men intothe Army who are physically unfit to undergo the strain of soldiering and the standardwe demand is no higher than it was in  pre-war days.    Yet in 1985  although 68,000presented themselves at  recruiting offices, the  number accepted for enlistment wasunder 26,000.  Of those  not accepted no less than  31,000 were rejected  for  physical and  medical  reasons.  All  efforts therefore  that are being  made  to  improve thephysique of the nation are welcome from a military point of view.     10.  One of the great inducements to joining the Army in  the nineteenth centurywas the prospect of seeing something of the world and the possibility of a change fromthe ordinary routine of  the very dull  existence enjoyed by  the  majority of thepopulation.   Today, on the other hand, the majority of  the population  enjoy a lifethat is crowded with excitement.   They can listen on the wireless to entertainmentsfrom every part of Europe and they can inspect at the cinema the attractions of every part of the world.   It is not necessary to believe that the spirit of adventure is dying.(The Air Force  have no difficulty in obtaining  pilots.)   But  an  imaginative youngman can  satisfy his spirit of adventure far better by listening in to  his  own wireless and visiting the  local cinema than by  being  dumped  for five  or six years  in  somemonotonous  station in  India,  where  he  enjoys  these  same  pleasures to  a much diminished degree  and lacks entirely  the social advantages and feminine companionshipwhich he naturally demands.     11.  While it must be a cause  for satisfaction that there are fewer feckless and hungrycitizens than in the past, and that the standard of living of the whole population has improved, we must face the fact  that our main sources of recruitment are disappearing.And it must also be realized that into the more thoughtful and semi-educated minds ofthe young men of  today persistent and widespread propaganda is being  poured&apos; withthe object of persuading them that it is wicked to join the Army.  Canon Sheppard, aChaplain to the  King, has  persuaded 100,000 of his Majesty&apos;s subjects to  sign  anundertaking that never under any circumstances will they7 join His Majesty&apos;s Forces,--and Canon Raven,  also Chaplain  to His Majesty and Regius Professor of Divinity in
                                        othe University of Cambridge,  has stated  that  &quot; nine out  of ten  of  the  more  virilemembers &quot; of that  University would sooner go to prison than join  the Army.   while a different point of view has been expressed by  other leaders of  ecclesiastical opinion,notably within the last few weeks by the two Archbishops,  the pacifist campaign hashad a long start and is being pursued  with vigour especially by  the NonconformistChurches, and  it has the powerful support of such political and intellectual notabilitiesas Mr. Lansbury, Lord  Ponsonby and  Mr.   Aldous  Huxley  and the  half-heartedapproval of the majority of the Labour Party.     12. This  propaganda  is  not confined  to sermons and  speeches.   It is  ablysupported by films, plays, novels and nil the arts of the publicity agent, aud while itis easy to exaggerate the importance of propaganda it must be admitted that propaganda is never so powerful as when  it is  directed  towards  persuading people to act  inaccordance with their own inclinations.  For the reasons previously given  the  greatmajority of young  Englishmen today are not unnaturally reluctant to join the Armyand  when they are informed on high intellectual and spiritual authority that  asentiment that  might have been mistaken for laziness or cowardice  is really due to thepromptings of their higher nature they are readily inclined to recognise the authenticityof such information.     13. The  problem, therefore, may be  briefly stated as follows : We have  to persuade a new type of man to join the Army.  The main incentives of old to  joiningare no longer present while new  and powerful deterrents have to be met.     14. Before proceeding to  an examination of how the problem is  to  be solved, itmay  be permissible to express a doubt as to whether it  admits of  solution.  Whetherthe British Empire, vulnerable as it is in every continent, and most  vulnerable  in itsown  capital, can afford to retain the voluntary  principle when all  the other Powers ofEurope have not only resorted  to compulsory service but are at present busily engagedin extending the scope and prolonging the period of such service,  is at least doubtful.But pledges have been  given which put any form of conscription outside the sphere of practical politics during the existence of the present Parliament, and it would in anycase be difficult to  justify the  introduction of  compulsion,  whicb would be extremelyunpopular, until every possible  step had  been  taken to render  the voluntary systemefficacious.                      II. ACTION  ALREADY  TAKEN     15. Before considering  proposals for  dealing  with this question in the future theCabinet will probably wish to be informed of the  steps that have  already been taken and of the measure of success which has attended them.     16. I am convinced that it  is a mistake to deal with these matters gradually, tomake slight improvements from  time  to time  and to grant one or  two  concessionsannually as funds become available or as the demand  for reform  becomes increasingly difficult to resist.  It is better, although of course  it is  not always possible, to crowdinto one year all the concessions  in contemplation in order both to attract attention bydoing something spectacular and  to create a feeling of gratitude instead of the merelynegative sense of a legitimate grievance at  last redressed.     17. It was with this consideration in mind  that I attempted  in this year&apos;s army estimates to focus  attention upon the Territorial Army and to devote the means at mydisposal to improving conditions  of service in that force.    The steps taken included the extension of marriage allowance, hitherto restricted to men over 26. to  all married men over the age of 21,  an increase in the proficiencygrant,  and payments for drills, which meant that every qualified Territorial would have earned a sum of  5 on  leaving camp instead of SOs. as in the past.   In addition,  trained men  were  granted travelling expenses to an increased number of drills.   The allowance for officers in camp, which was formerly  1  a head, was raised to  5.   The result of these concessions has been extremely satisfactory.  Recruiting for the Territorial Army hasincreased  during the last five months by 60 per cent,  over what it was last year.  but while we may congratulate ourselves upon these figures, it  should  be borne in mind that the shortage is still in the  neighbourhood of 40,000 men and that establishmentswill shortly be increased by some 10,000 men to allow for the expansion  of the air defence of Great Britain  so that even if this satisfactory rate of recruitment were continued  indefinitely the deficiencies would not be made good until 1946.  (9930)                                                                   A 2
      18. The only concession made to the Regular Army at the same time was an increase in the subsistence allowance granted to men on leave.  This had hitherto been 9f(/. a day and was increased to Is. lid., which still compares unfavourably with the subsistence allowance granted to the Navy and which was made more as a concession to a just demand than in any hope of  improving recruiting.      19. This does not, however, mean that the recruiting activities of the War Office have been at a standstill.  During  the past  year these activities have  been  widely developed and many  new experiments  have been tried.  The need for  greater publicity has  been realized and  advantage  has been taken  of  professional  assistance.   A publicity bureau for  recruiting  has been  established in  the  War Office  and  a paid advertising agency with the services  of  experienced journalists has  been employed. This agency works  in  close  co-operation   both with the  Press and the principal cinema firms.   Greater and more  extended use has been made of posters, for the design of which  an advertising firm has been  engaged.   Steps  have been taken for the  distribution  from  door to  door of two million  broadsheets setting forth the advantages of Army  life. About 100 pictures of Army life have been included in news- reel  items shown  throughout the country, and the War Office  is actively interested in a film which is now  being  produced  and  is designed to  encourage recruiting. Other films of a similar  nature  are encouraged as  much  as  possible by the grant of facilities  and  the  Joan of troops.    Efforts have  also  been  made  by films and illustrations in the Press to acquaint the public with the greatly improved type of accommodation  that  is  now being constructed for the  Army  both in the way of barracks and of married quarters.     20.  One of the most effective ways of advertising the Army is for  the Army to show itself.   This year, every effort within the money available has been made to effect this  in two ways, first by &quot; At Homes &quot;, and  secondly, by recruiting marches.   Nearly every regimental depot and garrison, with the exception of Aldershot, has held  &quot; At Homes &quot; of  some sort or other, and a total of   3,000 has been expended.  Recruiting marches  are rather more difficult to stage as garrisons have been depleted and training must not be neglected.   However,  much has been  accomplished in  this  direction particularly  by the  Southern Command who  have been able to arrange visits by mechanized  units  to  Birmingham, the Forest  of Dean and  cities and towns  in  the West Country ;  an  excursion  was  also  made  into South  Wales  in the Western Command.     21.  An experiment is being tried at Shorncliffe under which 36 unemployed men were to  be  entertained  as guests for a week in  Army barracks.  The object was to allow potential recruits  to  see  the Army from the inside  without any obligation to enlist.  Initial difficulties  in connection with the first attempt having been overcome, it is  now proceeding.     22.  Whenever possible  the  Recruiting  Service sets up recruiting stalls  in connection with Army exhibits at shows, exbibitions, etc.   Examples of this form of publicity were to  be seen at the Royal Tournament, the Bath and West Show, Boys Exhibitions, etc.   The Royal Agricultural Society  have  also consented in future toallow a Recruiting Stall to be set up at their annual Royal Show.     23.  A committee has recently  investigated  the question whether it would be possible to lower the physical standard  in order to accept a larger number of recruits. While the conclusion reached is that for general service no alteration is desirable, it has been recommended that  some modifications of the standard may be  possible in those Corps where  certain minor disabilities  are of less importance than they are  in  the Cavalry,  Artillery and Infantry.  The necessary steps to implement these recommen-dations are being taken.   An experiment is  also being  tried at the  present time ofattesting men who are  below the physical standard with the view to seeing whether by physical training and  improved diet they  cannot be  brought up to that  standard within a  reasonable period.     24.  Other steps that have been taken include the grant of an extra week&apos;s furloughto serving soldiers on  the understanding that  they devote that time to searching for recruits for their own  regiment.   Investigations are also being  undertaken in consulta- tion  with the other Departments concerned to ascertain whether it may not be possible to obtain recruits for the British Army from the Dominions and Colonies.
     25. A further important innovation has been the establishment of an  InfantrySection of the Supplementary Reserve.  Men who join this body are obliged to servefor only six months with the Colours and subsequently to  come up for a period of 14days&apos;training annually for a period of six years.  It is  hoped that two main objectswill thus be achieved.  In the first place a large proportion of men who were unwilling to enlist for a long period may be prepared to do so for a short one,  and having seenwhat the life is  like may be willing to stay on as Regular soldiers.   As high a figureas 60 per cent, of pre-war infantry  recruits came in through  the Special Reserve.  Inthe second place, men whose occupations prevent them from going to camp and there-fore  cannot join the Territorial Army may be willing to join this force which will admitof their 14 days&apos; annual training being done at any time of the year.  The immediate effect of this proposal on recruiting figures will probably  be unfavourable.as some menwho  would have enlisted in any case will be inclined to take advantage of this scheme in order to give the Army a trial, but I believe that the result will be beneficial.     26. I have arranged to hold a luncheon for business men in London in  the  nearfuture which I hope will be attended by many of the principal  employers in order to enlist and co-ordinate their  support both for the Regular and the Territorial  Army.Arrangements  are  also  being  made for similar luncheons to  take place  in someof the larger provincial  towns.  The  great majority of  employers have been  both.patriotic and eager to assist but  each of them has his particular difficulties to overcome,and  I believe  that  the best way to  secure their  co-operation may be to set  up aCommittee consisting solely of business men who would compare their problems and suggest solutions to the War Office and would also criticize  helpfully any suggestions that the War Office had to put forward.   They  could be  of assistance principally intwo  directions,  by encouraging  their employees to join  the Territorial Army and by undertaking to give employment to men who have left the Regular Army.                          III.  ACTION  SUGGESTED     27.  There are only two ways of controlling the actions of human beings theone  is by compulsion, the other by persuasion.  The difficulties in the way of persuad-ing  the young men of the present generation to join the Army have been indicated.They are  very formidable, but I believe that they can be surmounted if the attack  isdelivered on every front suddenly  and simultaneously.   The avenues of approach arethe emotions, the reason and the senses.   We have to persuade the modern young mannot  only that it is good business to join the Army, but that  it is a fine thing to be a soldier, and when he has become one we have to make  him comfortable in order thathe may be contented and &quot; waken  envy of his happy lot.&quot;                               (a) PSYCHOLOGICAL     28. The appeal to . sentiment can hardly  be made through Act of parliament or administrative action, but  I would urge my  colleagues to  miss no opportunityof emphasising in their  speeches  the duty that young men  owe  to their  country. The violent  propaganda of the militant  pacifists  can only be  met  by  counter propaganda,- which should be at least equally  persistent.   Any assistance which can be obtained from spiritual bodies in this matter is of the highest value.  Unfortunately, it seems that pacifist propaganda, even by minor clerics, is &quot; news,&quot; whereas  admirable sentiments such as those recently uttered by the Archbishops are lucky to secure  small print in an obscure corner of the &quot; Times.&quot;     29. In this connection  I would refer to conversations that have taken place during the  past summer between representatives of the War Office and the Ministry  of Labour with the intention of securing closer co-operation between the two Departments in this matter of recruiting.  The Ministry have expressed their willingness to  give more prominence to recruiting posters at Labour Exchanges,  but  they are adamant in their refusal to instruct their officials to use their discretion in  suggesting  to unemployed men the possibility of joining the Army.   I find this reluctance difficult to understand. I doubt whether the inhabitants  of  any other country in Europe would  accept  as credible the statement that in Great Britain where young able-bodied, single men who have fallen out of insurance and remain unemployed are paid up to 17s. a  week,  the officials whose  duty it is to make them these payments  are  strictly  forbidden  even to mention to them the fact that their services are urgently needed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment and that good pay and an honourable career awaits them in the Forces of the Crown.     (9930)
 I am also  of  opinion that  in the  Ministry  of  Labour  Instructional  and Training- Centres  where young men are being trained at the expense of the State the entry of recruiting officers should no longer be strictly  prohibited, and that the  authorities should be authorised to suggest to men, whom they consider suitable, the  desirability of joining the Army.     30.  The attitude of mind which prohibits  an official from mentioning the Army to an  unemployed man  is partly responsible for the  contempt with which military service continues to be regarded  by  large sections of the population.  It is significant that in other countries where compulsion is in force there are few complaints of it and, so far as  I am  aware, the abolition of it forms no part of the programme of any of  the Left Wing parties in Europe.  I  believe that a less  half-hearted advocacy of military service would meet with a growing response.     31.  From a  psychological point  of view it has been urged  and strongly supported by the majority of senior officers  whom I  have consulted that nothing would be  more effective than an alteration in Army uniform in order to produce something more pleasing to the eye than the present  khaki.   The  Adjutant-General considers that this as an immediate attraction for recruits is the most important of all the proposals put forward. If it should be decided to adopt this  suggestion  it would  be  most desirable  that  it should be done with as little  delay as possible in order that the troops who take part in the Coronation may be seen in  the new uniform.   It  is  pointed out  in  support  of this change  that the Brigade of Guards, who still wear full dress, have no difficulty  in obtaining recruits, but it must be borne in mind that the Brigade of Guards have  the additional advantage of a shorter period  of  service with the  Colours, little  foreign service, and greatly increased opportunities of obtaining subsequent employment.   It is not suggested that full dress should be restored, the expense of which would be more than twice as great, but that the whole Army should be given blue uniform both for ceremonial  occasions  and for walking out.  The  additional annual cost to  the State is estimated at  91,000 and the capital expenditure in the coming  year would be  400,000 provided it were restricted  to the Regular  Army.  It  is thought, however, that it would be impossible not to extend  the  privilege to  the Territorial Army  in which case the figures  would be  increased to  130,000 and   630,000 respectively. The cost to India would  be  13,000  and  150,000.  The experiment has already been tried  of allowing soldiers to buy this  uniform at their  own expense for walking out purposes and advantage has been  taken on  a  considerable  scale of the permission  so granted.                                 (b) ECONOMIC     32.  The obvious  way  in  which to  render any  type  of  employment  more attractive is to  increase wages.  The remuneration  of soldiers  does not compare favourably with that of men employed in industry, and  it would therefore  be  easy  tojustify an increase in Army pay.   Many of my advisers believe that nothing would prove more  effective.   I do not, however, recommend the proposal.  In the first  place it would  necessitate a similar increase in the pay of the  other two services, in the second pi ace it would have repercussions on industry and in the third place His Majesty&apos;s Government would appear to be admitting either that they had underpaid their  soldiers in the past or else that they  were now  reduced to bribing  men  to join  the Army.Increased pay should be  the  very last resort  to  which we should be  driven beforeconscription.  Instead  we should seek  to remove those causes  which  at   presentinevitably prevent young men from joining the Army and those grievances which make them  discontented after they have joined it.    33.  Undoubtedly  the  most   powerful  deterrent from  recruiting at the  presenttime is that the Army  does not offer a  promising or safe career.   What wise fatherwould advise his son at the age of 18 to adopt a  profession which will very probablyleave  him without employment and without training for any employment at the ageof 25?  The reckless  young man in search of adventure may  be tempted, but theprudent young man, thinking of marriage  and the  future, will look elsewhere.   Iam convinced that the voluntary  system is bankrupt unless the State can guarantee to every  man who serves in  the  forces and who leaves with  a good character thathe will pass immediately into employment.   I am  convinced  that this  is the endtowards which  we should work and  that  it is not incapable of achievement.   once it is achieved the  problem is solved and the difficulty will not be in obtaining recruits
but in selecting them.   The prudent young man will be first at the recruiting ollice.Seven  years in the  service of his country constituting a claim which he  knows willnot be disregarded seven years of youth spent in an open air life with the attractionof games, sport and foreign travel  and  the certainty of a job at the  end of it will attract the best men into the Army and because they  are the best men the difficultyof finding them work afterwards will rapidly diminish.     34.  How is this end to be achieved?  In the first place I believe that more mightbe done in the direction of reserving employment for ex-Service men  in government service, and I would  suggest that a Committee be set up of representatives of  theHome  Office,  Ministry  of  Labour,  Office  of Works,  Post  Office  and the  service departments  to  enquire into this matter.   One  of  the  stumbling blocks  hithertohas been that a  man who has served in  the forces and subsequently  joins the CivilService is not permitted to count his  previous service  for purposes of  pension.This is a difficulty that should not be insurmountable.  It should also prove possible,as suggested  in paragraph  26 above, to obtain the  assistance of the  industrial and commercial community in this matter.     35.  The  main  difficulty with regard to  obtaining employment is the fact thatthe men  are no longer  in their first youth and have had no training  for civil life.An average of approximately 17,500 pass out of the Army annually  on the expiration of their Colour service.   Of these 5,500  are accounted for in the following ways :     Tradesmen, readily employable    ...    ...     ...     ...    ...     1,500    Men with insufficient Colour service,  character less than &quot; Good,&quot;       etc.............       ...     .........     1,000    Men for whom other Government  employment is available    ...     1,500    Men with Civil  employment already waiting     ...     ...    ...     1,5005,500and  of  the  remaining 12,000  we  are  already  able  to  give  vocational training to3,000 at the three Army Vocational Training Centres that exist.   During  the  last three years the percentage of men leaving those Training Centres  who have passedstraight into employment has varied from 74 per cent, to 80 per cent. The core of theproblem therefore consists of 9,000 men, a serious  figure  but not one with whichit is  impossible to deal.  It should be the duty of the  State to ensure first, that everyone  of  these men leaves  the Service  with some qualifications to  fit  him  for  civil employment, and secondly, to see that  he obtains such employment.     36.  It would  seem obvious that  if the State is  to intervene in the training ofmen  for employment, such intervention should be the work of one  Department only.The  Ministry of  Labour already have many training  centres in various parts of thecountry where admirable training  for industry  is provided for the  unemployed,  andat  first sight there would appear  to be  everything in  favour of combining the threeArmy Vocational Training Centres with  those already  in existence and  bringing the mall under the control of the  Ministry of Labour.  Without wishing to rule out thepossibility of adopting. such  a  policy in  the future  I must suggest that  there  are considerable difficulties in  the way of adopting  it at the present time.  The Ministryof Labour  have,  I  understand,  experienced  great difficulty in persuading  theunemployed to accept the training  that  is offered them and  this difficulty would obviously be increased if the training centres were full of soldiers, as the unemployedappear to have  an unreasonable  hatred  of  their  fellow subjects  who  serve theircountry.  At the same time it is  quite  possible  that the  soldiers concerned, withoutreturning such animosity, might  be inclined to  look askance at institutions wherefree  training was  offered  to  the  unemployed.   In other words, there is  a  danger that  the unemployed man might look upon the training centre as a  barracks and the soldier might look upon it as a workhouse.  One  would be afraid of  being militarized,the other would be ashamed of being pauperized.   These difficulties  should  not beinsurmountable,  but I am inclined to  think it  would be a mistake  to attempt tosurmount them too suddenly, and I  should  prefer that  the  two   types  of  trainingcentres, the military and the civil, should develop side  by side for the time beingwith  a view to their amalgamation in the future.     37. My proposal therefore is that sufficient  additional Army Vocational TrainingCentres should be  set up  to  accommodate all men who  leave the  Army with good.characters and at the same time the fees which  they  are now  asked to pay for such
1  training should be abolished.  It certainly seems anomalous that men who have served  their country for  0 years should be compelled to pay for vocational training,  which  men who have not served at all receive for nothing in the Training Centres controlled  by  the Ministry of Labour.  The cost of setting up such a scheme would  amount to  about   870,000 and the annual payment  would be  524,000.  There would  also  be a cost to the Government of India of  300,000 annually.      38.  Should this  extension of vocational training  take  place,  there  will still  be a certain number of men returning from abroad who will not go through Vocational  Training Centres  for  the  reasons  given in  paragraph  35.    At  present  these  men are allowed only a fortnight&apos;s leave  in  which to  look for  employment.  They  are out of touch with conditions at home.  I propose, therefore, that all men returning  from abroad without a reasonable unexpired period of Colour service shall be allowed  to extend their service to give them a period at home of six months.  This will secure  them an opportunity of getting in touch with conditions at home before being thrown  on the labour market.                                    (c) Social      39. Having  aroused  some  enthusiasm  for  the  profession of  arms, having attempted to render it  a  career which will appeal to the industrious as well  as to the  idle apprentice we have still to make the  conditions of service sufficiently  satis- factory and agreeable to ensure that both the  serving soldier and the ex-service man can he relied upon as recruiting agents.     40. It  is generally admitted that the most unpopular feature of military service is the period that the majority of  soldiers are compelled to serve  in  India.   Not only do they suffer from the climate,  from the lack  of amusements and  feminine companionship, from  the  housing conditions,  for the majority of barracks  are very inferior to those that are now being erected in Great Britain,  but also they find that their pay does  not go so far and  that they  cannot even save  money during their exile.   The  officer serving in India receives  some financial advantages during  the period of his service there.  The private soldier receives no equivalent.  It is suggested that an increase of 6c/. a day to all  other ranks who serve abroad would remove  the grievance.  Such an expatriation payment would lessen, if not  do away  with,  the unpopularity of service  abroad and  would enable the careful soldier-to return home with something to his credit.  The cost would be  272,000 to the  Home Government, and   513,000 to the Government of India.     41. Men are not entitled to furlough with  free passage until they have completed six years in India and still have service  to give in India.   On the other hand officers can  afford to pay for their passages and thus take leave at home.  It is suggested that,  like officers, men should be enabled to take furlough to England during  their tour of duty in India.   This is, of  course,  impossible unless  the State is  prepared to contribute towards the cost of their passages.  A system has been worked out by which men would be assisted to the extent of  10 a head which is about 50 per cent. of the cost.  This  would cost this country   27,000 and  India  127,000.     42.  There is  nothing  that Englishmen resent  so  deeply as  the  infliction  of injustice.  Recruits are told that on  joining the Army they will be paid 14s. a week. They are  not told  that  during their first months of service out  of  that 14s. there will  be a series of stoppages  in payment  for  articles of clothing,  equipment and maintenance about which  they will not  be  consulted  and for which   no  cash allowance is issued. A private employer who  treated his servants in such a fashion would probably lose his case if one were brought against him in a Court  of Law. Not only is a recruit compelled to pay for part of his equipment  out of his own money, but further, when he is trained and is sent to India, he has additional expenses in the shape of a pith helmet and an extra uniform for which again he is compelled to pay.  Great indignation has recently been  expressed against  this system which will require the additional troops  ordered to Palestine to  pay for their pith helmets out of their own money.  This is an injustice which should be clone away with without delay. The  cost would be   67,000 in the first year and  52,000 annually.     43. Another injustice under which the Army suffers at present is the provision of only three meals a day whereas  the Navy enjoys four meals,  the last being supper.The Army are provided with nothing later than tea.   When members of the  Services are serving  in  close proximity, as they recently have been in the  Near East,  the difference in their  conditions naturally leads to  a feeling of  resentment.   The cost
of providing  an additional meal on four nights a week  would be  305,000 a year,and if it were  extended to every  night the cost would be  495,000.   The cost toIndia  if adopted there would be  110,000 or  1S0,000.    44.  There are a number of minor  improvements which are urgently needed inthe conditions in which the troops are asked to live,  one of which,  the  substitution of butter for margarine, has recently figured  rather prominently in the House ofCommons, and the provision of all of which is overdue.   These include such matters as an  increase in cash or kind of the ration issued to men not  fed in mess, improve-ments in the  diet of boys and in messing arrangements,  increase of fuel  allowance,improvement  of cookhouse, dining room and institute  apparatus and amenities, extratentage  for institutes in camps, better furniture in married quarters, improved con-ditions in troopships, etc., the cost of all  of which added together would amount toan initial expenditure of  372,000 and  an annual expenditure of  579,000.                                  CONCLUSION    45.  Many  of  these  reforms  besides  those  specially mentioned  will  inflictexpenditure  not only upon the Home Government but  also  upon  the  Governmentof India and it may be difficult  for  that Government to agree to  them.   every endeavour must of course be made to secure  their acceptance,  but  if the principle involved receives the approval of the Cabinet, the attitude of  the  Government ofIndia  should  not be  allowed to prevent its being put into force.  The Army Councilconsider that these reforms constitute the minimum that is calculated to bring theBritish Army up to strength and upon this the safety of the whole Empire depends.    46.  The  total cost of the proposals put forward in preceding paragraphs amountsto  1,941,000 and the annual charge would be  1,889,000.  The respective amounts&quot;so far as the Government  of India are concerned are  150,000  and  1,139,000.These are formidable figures  but I believe they represent the price of the  survival of the voluntary system. This.is not the place to dilate upon the advantages of  that system.   Suffice it to say that they are  numerous.  I believe  them to  be worth themoney.   Large as the figure is  it is not enormous in comparison with the sums  thatit has  been agreed upon to expend on the re-equipment of the forces.  If less is spentand half measures are  adopted it  may well come about that in  succeeding yearsconcession after concession will be wrung from  the  Government  until the amounthere contemplated is reached.    But the effect on recruiting  will not be the samebecause the increase will have been gradual so that the  result might be that in theend the same amount of money would have been spent  and little  or nothing wouldhave been accomplished.    47.  Politically these suggestions have much to recommend them, and they could hardly meet with serious opposition in the House of Commons as they are principallydesigned to improve the conditions of the private soldier.  At  the same time theywould impress  the country as  a whole, and  what is more important,  they wouldimpress foreign countries with the determination  of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government tomake  good our deficiencies  in men as well as in equipment.  Nor could it be alleged that they were in any way excessive or provocative as they  are solely  intended tobring  up to  strength our existing military establishments which are smaller  todaythan they werevin 1914 by no less than  22 battalions,  although our  Imperial respon-sibilities have increased and the international situation has deteriorated.
