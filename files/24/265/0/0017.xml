2-iIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP IVIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).BE OR E T.    Memorandum by/blie Minister for Co-ordination of                     Defence,,       When Parliament reassembles, we must anticipate a continuance of the attacks made on the Defence Programmebefore the Recess&apos;, mostly by supporters of the Government,,It seems to me to be necessary that I should be enabled? indealing with such attacks, to cay that the Government haverecently again reviewed the main principles on which theprogramme was based and that what I shall have to sayrepresents the conclusions of the Government based on thatreview,.       The main principles on which the programme: is basedmay perhaps be summarised as follows:-     (l) while the necessity of appropriate measures of         preparation for a major war is not forgotten, the         immediately pressing problem is to make good, within         a limited period? the accrued deficiencies in the         equipment of the fighting services;     (2) this task,- including the creation of a &quot;shadow&quot;         industry to the necessary extent, can best be carried         out by the efforts of the three Service Departments,         co-ordinated by myself and my staff, and improved,         as nay be found requisite, in regard to organisation,         but without any major reorganisation  of the         supply system in peace;     (3) that the task is to be carried out &quot;without impeding         the course of normal trade&quot; (White Paper Gmd.  1507         page.16).Jo P. 297 (56),0BDEFENCE PROGRAMME
        It has been made  clear more than once that while these are  the main principles, the Government is always ready to reconsider them,  should  this appear requisite for the success of the  programme, or necessary by reason of any change in the situation.        The Government have also, as necessity has arisen, approved extensions, &quot;both large and costly, to the supplies estimated to be required under the original programme - the expanded scheme for Air Defence of Great Britain&quot;is a good instance of this.        The main grounds  on which attack was based before the Recess  (and may be expected again to be based) may be summarised as follows: (l) the scope of the programme, limited as it is in the  main to making good deficiencies, is far too narrow and the period  set for it is far too long.   What the degree of extension and  acceleration should be is a matter on which different views are  expressed on different occasions.   At times, war production comparable to that attained towards the end of the last war seems to be thought necessary, and the&apos;achi evement of Germany is quoted as the model to be followed, little or no allowancebeing made for the fact that Germany, unlike this country, has undertaken the task of providing and equipping land forces of very large size and of organising to munition them in war.   at other times attention is concentrated on specific points whereit is contended more must be done as e.g,,  that the Air ForceProgramme,  as it how stands,  is quite inadequate,  or that the reconditioning of the Territorial Army should be put in hand at                     0once.      j       It is  further maintained (2)  that the situation demandsthe immediate establishment of a separate executive Ministry ofSupply or,  if not that,  then the appointment of a second Minister,in addition to myself,  not executive but responsible for theco-ordination of the supply activities of the Service Departments.
      It  is further maintained,  (3) that, to meet the realneeds of the  situation,  there must at least he some modifica-tion  of  the principle  that  the course of normal trade is not tohe  impeded.    it is contended that the shortage of skilled labour is becoming so  serious as, in itself, to make a changeof  policy necessary.   What the new policy is to be is notvery  clearly  stated.   The most common conception seems to bethat  the Government must at once take war powers for thegeneral  control of the industries required to carry out warpreparation and that,  to the extent requisite for the purpose and only to that extent, such industries can be and must be diverted from peace to war production.      The general line  which I have so far followed in reply tothose  criticisms is (1), that there is a time limit to the .*programme, the utmost  speed is necessary, ana any major re-organisation  of the executive machinery of supply must involvegreat  loss of time during the change-over.   Improvements indepartmental  arrangements could and would, of course, be- made(as e.g. they have been made by the appointment of Sir HaroldBrown  as Director-General of Munitions Production and memberof  the Army Council, with a reorganised supply department under him).    So far as my experience had gone, I saw no needfor a  second  Minister, not executively managing supply butco-ordinating the work of the Departments.   (2), though the diversion of  industry  from peace to war production would nodoubt  in time lead to  a great increase of war supplies, yetat  the outset, a long period must elapse before industry canbe  adapted and equipped for the new forms of production andthere would thus here  again be great loss of time.   (3) partialdiversion of  industry, under which some firms are left to their peace production and other films constrained to abandon it,
 would be most difficult, if not indeed impossible,  to work and would produce such grave discontent and indeed such a feeling Of injustice that it could only &quot;be resorted to in circumstances of extreme necessity.   in practice what would have to be  con- templated would be diversions  of industries or branches of industry as a whole.    But such a step is not  necessary at present to meet the needs  of the programme and its  results, present and future, on the financial and economic position of the  country must be so grave that they could not be faced  except at  imminent risk of war and after full consideration of the extent  to  which,  taking account  of national  war capacity alone, the  supply argument for them outweighs  the  other arguments against  them*           Further  review of the  position as  it exists  to-day does not,  I  think,  dictate  any change  of these conclusions, though conditions may  at any time  so alter as  to invalidate them and careful and  continuous  survey  of  the  situation  will always be  requisite.          The scope  of  the programme must be kept steadily under review by  the Committee of  Imperial. Defence, advised by  theChiefs of  Staffs Committee,  in presence, on  the one side,  of the international situation, and, on  the other side, of the  limits of the productive capacity of industry under the conditions as to continuance of normal trade  laid down in  the programme.          As regards progress with  the programme, the positiongenerally is still that departments are  in the stage oflocating capacity and placing orders.   Material results in theway of delivery of many of the  major supplies do not begin toaccrue till say, twelve months  after the programme is launched and it will be necessary to  insist  on this point in reply tocritics - who have themselves publicly  admitted it.   Exanin- ation by the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee  of  the monthly progress reports of  the Departments  will continue  to serve as a very useful means of ascertaining where any lags inprogress exist and  how  to deal with them.
will continue to he watched by the Departments in consul-tatioa with their contractors-9 reinforced by the  arrangementsfor central consultation3  which I have established withsuch industries as e.g,3 the very important machine tooltradeo     The one question which does give reason for  anxietyis the prospect in regard to the supply of skilled labour  asthe programme passes from contracts to output.   I have sofar acted on the view that this matter is best dealt with  asbetween masters and men in the given industrys in presenceof an assured volume of business to coaie to them  under theprogramme.    On these lines there is in process all thetime a steady expansion of the effective labour forces through such measures as large addition of apprentices and increasein Ministry of Labour trainees, i.x.troduct?Lon  of  nightshifts3 gradual introduction of additional machinery forthe purpose of still further sub-dividing process and the steady transfer, without troubles of semi-skilled men towork appropriate to them.    These measures are proceedingwithout labour troubles and it is in my view essentialthat the longest possible time should be allowed  for themto have their natural effect.   Direct action by  theGovernment  with the object, for example, of securingdilution might well lead to very serious labour unrest and concessions to labour apt to damage the position ofthe export  trade.   I should anticipate that, long beforethe need for such action arises, ample warning will beavailable and there will be time to explore all avenueswith industry and devise the least harmful solutions.
      The above is the best judgment I can form on thesituation as it is to-day.  If material change in thescope and time of the programme should be requisite ase.g., by the necessity for still further and more rapid increase of the Royal Air Force in response to Germanaction, further consideration of the problem wouldbecome necessary.      I should add that the specific points of doubt ordifficulty raised in the private conversations at the endof last Session on the defence situation between the primeMinister and myself and various members of both Houseshave been now fully reported on by the departments and thatI hope to arrange at an early date for further similarconversations which should, in my judgment be of great assistance in dealing with the situation in Parliament.
