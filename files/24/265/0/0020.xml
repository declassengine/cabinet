Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 300 (36).CABINET.LOCATION  OF PROPOSED  CORDITE FACTORY  AT  GRETNA.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.    1.  THE proposal made in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar (OP. 262 (36)) that the Cordite Factory should not be built at Bishopton inRenfrewshire (as sanctioned by the Cabinet on the 8th April, 1936), but on a sitein Cumberland near  Gretna or Longtown, raises a very serious question from the standpoint both of general principles and  of the Governments position in theSpecial Areas in Scotland.    2.  The  Bishopton  site  was  recommended  by   an   interdepartmental committee who proceeded on the  footing  that it was desirable,  if possible, toestablish  this Factory  in the Scottish  Special  Areas.   The  Minister  forCo-ordination of Defence referred to the transfer of the existing Factory &quot; to a place in Scotland &quot; in his speech in the House of Commons on the 20th. July.  TheLord President had previously said in his speech in  the Debate on the SpecialAreas on the 2nd March that the Government themselves proposed to adopt therecommendations which they had been pressing upon private  employers and toplace important orders and plant new industries within those Areas in the courseof the development of their rearmament scheme.    Although the Scottish Special Areas were not expressly mentioned, there isno doubt  that the Government&apos;s general policy of stimulating economic develop-ment in the Special Areas,  combined  with the above-mentioned statements inconnection with  the defence programme, have aroused strong expectations inScotland that the Cordite Factory will be established within the Scottish SpecialAreas.  The Scottish Development Council and the Economic Committee which ithas set up,  largely  at the instance of  my predecessor, to stimulate  industrialrevival, are closely interesting themselves in the question whether  a due share ofthe  rearmament programme is being allocated to Scotland.    3.  There is no doubt that an announcement that the Cordite Factory is not tobe erected as hitherto announced in the Scottish Special Areas, would excite strong criticism in Scotland and that such a decision could only be defended in the comingDebates on the Special Areas and  outside of Parliament if it could be shown tobe absolutely essential for over-riding reasons.    4.  The reasons which are given in the  Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum andin the Minutes and Conclusions of the D.P.R.C. do  not appear  to me on suchexamination as I have been able  to give  to furnish  adequate justification forabandoning the Bishopton site.   I  should like to make comments on the followingpoints :      (i) Labour supply and employment.-1 entirely agree with the Minister ofLabour that in these respects the  Bishopton site has  great advantages over theGretna site.  Moreover, the construction of a large Factory just outside the county of Dumfries will impose a heavy financial burden on the Local Authority of thatCounty in respect of maintenance of roads, policing,  &amp;c, without any financialadvantage, temporary or permanent.

                                      dm     (ii)  Water supply. I am informed that the Glasgow Corporation could sparewithout difficulty from their Milngavie reservoirs the estimated war requirement of 10 million gallons a day and  could increase this to 12 million gallons a  day by minor alterations and to at least 17 million gallons a day by laying additionalmains to the reservoir.     As to quality, the Scottish Department of Health, who were consulted by theWar Office at an earlier stage, then understood that the softness of the Glasgowwater is a disadvantage.  But that disadvantage applied also to the supply whichthe  Interdepartmental Committee had in view  when they  recommended  theBishopton site, and which they were advised could be made satisfactory by watertreatment plant.     As regards the suggestion that the Glasgaw water  would be expensive, Iunderstand that no negotiations as to price have taken place and that the normalGlasgow charge  of  5^d.  per 1,000 gallons for commercial purposes  might besubject to reduction in the case  of the large  supplies  for the Cordite Factory.There appears to be no reason to  suppose that  the cost of the water (allowing forthe cost of transmitting it from Milngavie to  Bishopton) would be unreasonable.     In the  case of the &quot; Gretna &quot; site, if legislation is  necessary to authoriseabstraction  of water from the River Esk, there may be serious risk of opposition and  delay,  especially in  view  of   the  fact that  a  proposal  to  abstract2 million gallons a day from the Tweed for domestic purposes was held up byopposition for more than two years.   In the circumstances, the anticipationthat transfer to the &apos;&apos; Gretna &apos;&apos; site would mean a saving in time of 6 or 7 monthsmay require further examination.  It should be remembered that the previousdevelopment of the &quot; Gretna &quot; site was done in  war time and under D.O:R.A.powers.     (iii)  Facilities for Factory expansion. This is mainly a technical matter, butit must be kept in mind that a large part of the site used by the Gretna Factoryduring the war has been developed for other purposes and is no longer available.     5.  As  for the final suggestion that the erection of a chemical factory is notin the long run a great asset  to any  district  I think  that this  would prove a double-edged argument,  and it would place  any Government spokesman in aposition  of  some  difficulty if he attempted  to  use it as a  reason  why  this factory, costing some  3^ million, should not be constructed in an area containing64,513 registered  adult males unemployed  to-day, where the Government  hasbeen using its utmost endeavours to get employers generally to undertake workof however temporary a character.     6.  For  these reasons I trust that  the Bishopton site will be adhered toeven if it involves somewhat greater cost than the proposed alternative site inCumberland.                                                   (Initialled)       W. E.    Scottish Office, November 2, 1936.
