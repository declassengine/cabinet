SECRET.                                          Copy  No.YW........                           CABINET.CP.  282  (36)             COMMITTEE ON PRESERVATION OF  PUBLIC ORDER.                            REPORT.                 The Committee has held four meetings and  has  reached       the  unanimous conclusion that  a Bill,  which might he  called       the  Public Order Bill,  1936, is necessary.       2.         The Committee has gone through the proposed  Clauses       with the  Parliamentary Draftsman and has reached  provisional       agreement on what  these Clauses should contain, though some       adjustment of details remains  to be done.   As the  draft Bill       may  not be ready for full consideration by the members of the       Cabinet before-next Wednesday&apos;s meeting, I summarise  for the       information of  the Cabinet the heads of the Bill  as follows.       3.         The Bill would deal  with  four matters.            (l)   Uniforms .   The wearing of uniform signifying         association  with any jgadgfyrsaafb&amp;K  organisation or  with the         furthering of any political object i-aszjgBii&amp;s would be an         offence, if  the wearer is present at any public  meeting or         makes  a speech  in any public place or takes part with other         uniformed persons in any procession or the like.K   In order         to  exclude from the  operation of the Bill the  wearing of         uniform in circumstances which raise no fear of  public         disturbance  (such as an Orange procession in Liverpool,  or         a Trade Union procession in regalia) there would be a provisoNOTE:   Since  the Committee approved the draft of the Clause  in theabove form,  I  have received a  deputation from the Manchester Corporation.This  deputation  strongly  urges that Fascists in uniform  who  wander aboutthe streets in twos and threes or who stand at street corners to sell the Fascist newspapers are just as provocative a cause of  disorder andalarm as uniformed Fascists making speeches or joining in  a  procession.It is,  I think,  for consideration whether  the proposed Clause could notbe simplified  by making it an  offence to wear uniform as abovedescribed &quot;in  any public  place&quot;.
that a Chief Officer of Police, if satisfied that the wearingof such uniform would not &quot;be likely to involve risk of publicdisorder, may permit it, but it is proposed that thispermission can only be given &quot;with the approval of theSecretary of State&quot; .   Finally, no prosecution for the illegalwearing of uniform can be instituted without the authority ofthe Attorney General.   This will prevent foolish orextravagant interpretations of the Clause.   The committee recommend that there shall be no definition of uniform, so thatthe question whether a garb amounts to a uniform will be decided by the Magistrate who hears the case.   (2) Secondly, the Bill would make illegal any associationof which members are (a) trained .in exercises of a military character or organised on military lines for the purpose of enabling them to be employed in furthering any politicalobject, or (b) are organised with a view to usurping orsupplementing without lawful authority the functions of the armed forces of the Crown or the Police .   If the association is so organised and trained as to arouse reasonable apprehensionthat they are trained for these purposes, this will besufficient evidence of such a purpose being intended.   A persontaking part in organising such an unlawful association wouldbe guilty of an offence, and the Draftsman is to considerwhether power could not be given to the Attorney General tomove the Court to wind up such an organisation.   (3) Processions.   This is a very difficult part of thesubject, but the majority of the Committee feel that it isessential to include in the Bill presented to Parliament a clause on this subject.   If not, amendments dealing withprocessions are certain to be pressed from various quarters of
   the House and in the end some provision will have to he   included.   The Committee propose that the proper authority   (the Police in London and the local authorities in Boroughs   and Urban Districts in the Provinces) should have power to   regulate the routes to be followed by processions, and to   give special directions and to impose conditions where   obstructions or breaches of the peace are likely to arise.   Moreover, if the proper authority are of opinion that by   reason of unusual circumstances existing in any part of the   area the above powers are insufficient to enable them to   prevent serious disorder from resulting from the holding of ..   a procession,  they may prohibit the holding of such   procession altogether, or with the consent of the Secretary   of State may prohibit in that portion of their area any   processions during such period as may be specified in the   Order .      (4)  As regards meetings, the only provisions which the   Committee think should be included in the Bill are to the   effect, first, that where the Police apprehend serious   disorder by reason of any intention to hold two or more   public meetings at or near the same time or place, the Police   may impose such conditions upon the persons organising any   such meeting as are necessary to prevent disorder arising.   And secondly,  any person who, while taking part in a procession   or present at a public meeting, has with him any offensive   weapon will be guilty of an offence, provided that the accused   may defend himself by proving that he had the weapon with him   for a lawful purpose and for reasonable cause.4.   There are one or two incidental provisions such as a definition clause, a clause which increases the penalty for using
26th October,  1936.abusive language  calculated to  produce  a &quot;breach of the peace,and a clause applying the Act  to  Scotland.    It is proposed  thatit should not apply to Northern Ireland.5.        If the  Cabinet approves the above  outline, the Billin final draft will be ready  to be circulated very shortly,  andits actual text might receive  Cabinet approval next week.                         Signed on behalf  of the Committee .                                    JOHN  SIMON.                                          Chairman.
