Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE herewith the draft memorandum for communication to theFrench, German, Belgian and Italian Governments as now amended in the lightof the views expressed at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 13th instant.                                                                 A.  E.    November 16, 1936.                         NEW WESTERN TREATY.Draft of Memorandum for communication to the French, Belgian, German and                          Italian Governments.    (Insertions in this draft are shown in italics and suggested deletions in                            square brackets.)    IN their memorandum of the 4th November His Majesty&apos;s Government  inthe United Kingdom had the honour to invite the Belgian, French, German andItalian Governments  to consider further a number  of matters in order  to see whether the various views  expressed by the  five Governments thereon could  be reconciled.  In that event it would be possible to agree on certain fundamental principles as a basis  for the proposed conference.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmentadded that it was their intention to make known at an early date their own viewson these matters.    2.  The first of these matters concerns the guarantees to be provided in thenew treaty,  and in this memorandum His Majesty&apos;s  Government wish, for theirfart, [in particular,]  to deal with the questions of a guarantee to this country  by france and  Germany  [and of a guarantee by Belgium to those two countries.]    3.  On  this subject,  [As regards a guarantee  to the United Kingdom,] theGerman Government have suspended a final expression of their views  until  theyhave learned those of the other Governments, and the Italian Government  havegiven reasons why they doubt the desirability of extending the non-aggression andguarantee obligations of the new treaty beyond  the  limits of the Treaty  of locarno.    4. His Majesty&apos;s Government see no reason to abandon their view that theUnited Kingdom should receive guarantees from France and Germany, but theywould appreciate a further exposition of the views  of the German and italian governments on this point.  In this connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government would      8884  [14091]                                               B
recall that in the discussions on the subject of the proposed Air Pact between thefive Powers in the spring of 1935 it was proposed that the guarantees to be givenshould include one to Great Britain by Germany and France; and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were then under the impression that this proposal was agreeable toGermany and Italy.  It is true  that on that occasion only air attack was underconsideration;  but it is difficult to contemplate an air attack which will  not involve the other arms.     [ 5.  The second question arising out of the discussions as to the form of thenew treaty concerns a guarantee by Belgium to France and Germany.  In their memorandum of the 22nd October the Belgian Government have explained why they consider that  it would be undesirable that Belgium should give a reciprocalguarantee to any of her co-signatories.  His Majesty&apos;s Government observe thatthe Belgian  Government undertake to forbid access to the territory of Belgium,and that they  state that Belgium will continue to observe  in  respect of  theobligations of the Covenant of the League of Nations the scrupulous fidelity which she has always shown in the past.  His Majesty&apos;s Government interpret this as implying the intention of the Belgian Government  to forbid access to Belgian territory by land and also the flight across Belgian territory of foreign aircraft to attack a third Power;  and, further, their  intention to take, should the casearise and in  accordance with paragraph 3  of article 16 of the Covenant,  &quot; thenecessary steps to afford passage through their (Belgian) territory to the forcesof any  of the  members  of the  League which are co-operating  to protect  theCovenants of the League.&quot;]     6.   The  third  question which it is  necessary  to consider is whether  theproposed non-aggression arrangements would be subject to exceptions, and,  if so,what the nature of these exceptions should be.  On this point there is a difference of opinion between the  views  expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and  theFrench Government on the one hand and the German Government on the other.While the two former Governments considered that certain exceptions would benecessary, the German Government &quot; have no motive for weakening the security for peace which lies in the conclusion of such an agreement for the renunciation of aggression by demanding exceptions of any kind whatever.   In case the  otherGovernments concerned should think it necessary to insist on making exceptionsof this kind, it would be for them to put forward proposals to this end.&quot;     7.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government fully  appreciate  that  the  position of  theGerman  Government may in this respect differ from that of other signatories tothe proposed treaty.  Germany is  not at  present a member  of  the League ofNations, and is not, so far as  His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware, a party toany  special  arrangements  for  the  rendering of  mutual  assistance against aggression.  The other signatories to the proposed treaty, however,  are all bound by the provisions of the  Covenant of the  League of Nations,  and some of  them have, in addition,  arrangements for mutual assistance in certain circumstanceswith States who would not be signatories to the new treaty.  It  is obvious thatthe  treaty must not be inconsistent with the obligations resulting from  the instruments referred to;  it would, for instance, be impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to become a  party to arrangements which might be incompatible with the provisions of their treaties with Iraq and Egypt.     8.   It appears therefore to  His Majesty&apos;s Government to be inevitable thatthe proposed non-aggression arrangements should be subject to such exceptions asmay be necessary to make them acceptable  by those  signatories whose position isas indicated above.  If so, the question arises of what should be the basis of such exceptions.  In their memorandum of the 17th September His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment expressed the view that they  should be on the lines which were laid  downin article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.  The German Government in their note ofthe 12th October point out that in article 2 of that treaty the important exceptionsare  laid down  with reference to the Covenant, and in particular to article 16thereof, and they give reasons which in their view preclude the repetition of theuse of this method.     9.   In these circumstances,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government desire to suggest  forthe consideration of the other Governments concerned the possibility of taking asthe basis of the exceptions (apart from the case of legitimate self-defence) an act
of aggression  by  a signatory to the new  treaty against a non-signatory whichconstitutes a violation of some instrument by which the signatory  in question is bound.  All the proposed signatories to the new treaty are bound by the Pact of paris, to which almost all the nations of the world are also parties; all of them,except at present Germany, are bound by the provisions of the Covenant of  theLeague  of Nations; and  any of them may also  be  parties  to non-aggressionarrangements  with particular countries.  It seems to His Majesty&apos;s Governmententirely legitimate, and indeed necessary, that an attack by a signatory to  thenew treaty upon a non-signatory, in violation of an obligation resulting from anyof the instruments mentioned above, [in violation of a treaty which is binding uponboth States,] should entitle any of the other signatories to come to  the assistanceof the victim  of aggression without thereby violating  its non-aggression under-takings   towards   the signatory  concerned.   This appears  to His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  to  be the  scheme  of  the  German-Polish  declaration  of  the26th January, 1934,  since  it is  there stated that the  two Governments havedecided to base their mutual relations on the principles of the Pact of Paris.   Ifthis scheme were  adopted, the rendering of assistance in such circumstances to anon-signatory  would  not bring into operation, on  one side or the  other,  the guarantees  to be  provided in  the new  treaty.   It appears to  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that  an exception on this basis would cover all the cases for which itis proper  that provision should be made, and  they  desire to  commend thissuggestion to the consideration of the other Governments concerned.     10.   The  next and  fourth question which arises is how a decision should bereached as to whether the non-aggression arrangements  in the new treaty have beenviolated.  If these are to contain exceptions, such as those suggested  above,  thisquestion assumes  particular importance,  for in order to determine whether thenon-aggression arrangements have been violated it might be necessary to determine whether a signatory  had attacked  a non-signatory in breach of  an  instrumentwhich was  binding between them.   It  appears  accordingly to His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be of  particular importance to provide a method of determiningthis question which should be efficacious, rapid in its action,  and such as to com-mand the confidence of  the  Governments concerned and of their peoples.     11.   In their memorandum of the  17th September  His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed the  opinion that the best method of determining this question woidd be to  confide  the   decision   to   the  Council  of  the  League   of  Nations. [From  this point  of view, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government remain of the  opinion, which  they expressed  in  their  memorandum  of the 17th September,   that the best method of determining this question  would be to confide  the decision to the Council of the League of Nations.] In their view the Council, both as regards its composition and the conditions in  which it works, would be a more  effective body for the purpose  in question than any other.  In this connexion the following considerations are, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, relevant.  What- ever changes may be introduced in the working of the League it appears probable, and it is certainly the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, that  the peace-preserving functions  of the  Council  will become  even  more important than in the past.  It is therefore probable, to say the least, that in the event of its being necessary to determine  whether a breach of the  non-aggression arrangements had occurred, the  Council  would have been dealing with  the  case practically from  the outset and would be  in full possession of  the facts;  and therefore from the point of view both of the authority which its  decision would carry and the rapidity with which such a decision could be given the Council would be a more  effective instrument than any other extraneous body.     12.  The German  memorandum of the 31st March, 1936, proposed such an  extraneous body  in the institution of an international court of arbitration which  would  have competence in respect of the observance  of the various agreements  concluded.  This proposal  is not repeated in the German memorandum of the  12th October, but His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to say that for the  purposes  of deciding the question now under consideration such a court, which is apparently  intended to be an ad hoc tribunal and might well be meeting for the1 first  time  when it had to decide whether an infraction of the non^aggression arrangements  had taken place,  would not in  their opinion present, from the. point of  view  either  of rapidity of decision, full  acquaintance, with the facts or the authority  Which  its decision would carry, the  same advantages as would the Council of the  League.        [14091]                                                     B 2
     13.  The German  Government now suggest that  the  decision should  bereached  by a common decision of the  signatories to  the  treaty who are,  in a given case, not directly parties to the conflict.  His Majesty&apos;s Government do not see that this solution would present any advantages over  the  course of leavingeach guarantor to decide for itself, and in their opinion it would possess distinctdisadvantages as compared with the system, of reference to  the Council, whichthe Treaty of Locarno provided for use in the case of both flagrant and  non-flagrant violations.  [And it is open to a particular objection which is mentionedin the next paragraph.]     14.  In  their observations on  this question the French  Government,  theGerman Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government all mention the case, whichwas dealt with  in article 4  (3) of the  Treaty of Locarno, of  immediate action by  the guarantors pending a subsequent decision as to whether a violation ofthe non-aggression arrangements had  taken place.  His Majesty&apos;s government note that in the German  Governments view  &quot;a distinction  between flagrantbreaches of the treaty and other kinds of breaches of the treaty such as was laiddown in the  old Rhine Pact will no longer come into consideration in the newpact.&quot;  In the view of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government, however (and this view&apos; is confirmed by  the discussions of the proposed air pact which took place last year),it  is no less  necessary now than it  was previously to make  provision for caseswhere a  sudden  and unprovoked attack (such, for&apos; instance, as  an air  attack) ismade in violation of  the non-aggression arrangements.  In  such  circumstancesimmediate action by the guarantors may be essential, and it would not be possibleto await a decision of the competent body.   It appears, however, to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be essential to provide, as was done in the Treaty of Locarno, thatguarantors, in deciding to  intervene, should know that their decision  is subjectto a subsequent pronouncement by the competent body, so as to ensure that action without a previous finding by that body  would not be taken except in cases where no reasonable doubt can exist.   If it is decided to adopt the Council of the Leagueas the body to decide  whether an infraction of the non-aggression arrang*ementshas taken place, there would be no  difficulty in  reproducing the scheme of theTreaty of Locarno in this respect.   [If,  however, the decision  were to be taken, asthe German Government suggest, by the signatories to the treaty  who were not directly parties  to the conflict, the following difficulty would  arise.  If all theguarantors had  immediately intervened to  assist the  signatory attacked, their decision would not, in fact,  be subject to any subsequent  control, because  theyevidently would  not concur in a finding that they had acted wrongly.  If, on theother hand, some of the guarantors had intervened and others had not, it wouldseem unlikely that it would be possible for a unanimous decision  to be reached at all.]    15.  His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate the importance and difficultyof this question as to how a decision should be reached whether the non-aggressionarrangements in the new treaty have been violated, and they would not wish, sofar as they are concerned, to  exclude from consideration any proposal which maybe made for dealing with it.  But for the reasons stated above they are still ofthe opinion that the best course would  be to entrust the decision to  the Councilof the League.   .     [15.  In view of all  these considerations, His Majesty&apos;s  Government remainof the opinion that the best course would be to entrust the decision to the Councilof the League.]    16.  Lastly  there remains the further point raised in His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s memorandum of the 4th November, namely, the point that other matters affecting European peace would, in the words of the communique&quot; of the 23rd July,necessarily come under discussion if progress could be  made at the  Five-power conference.  The German Government, in their memorandum  of the 12th October,state that they must reserve, until the result of the Five-Power Conference ha?been reached, their attitude with regard to the question whether, and if so, which,other problems might later be discussed.  His Majesty&apos;s Government feel obligedto make it  clear  that the  importance which they attach to the successful outcome of the Conference of the Five Powers is due not  only to their wish to see a new treaty take the place of the Treaty of Locarno, but also because they continue to
assume that if progress can  be  made at this meeting, other matters affectingEuropean peace  will  necessarily  come  under  discussion,  [such a successful outcome of the Conference of  the Five Powers is  intended to lead to the solutionof other  questions which are  of  direct interest to the peace of Europe.]    17.   His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom hope that they may receive the views of the Belgian (French) (German) (Italian) Government on thequestions dealt with in  this memorandum at as early a date as possible.    18.   A similar memorandum has been addressed to the French, German andItalian (Belgian,  German  and Italian) (Belgian, French and  Italian) (Belgian,French and German) Governments.
