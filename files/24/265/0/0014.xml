(C.I.D. Paper No. 428-C.)     (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 281st Meeting, Minute 1.)     THE COMMITEE had under consideration a Memorandum by.the Secretary of State for  Air (C.I.D.  Paper No.  428-C) requesting the authority of the Committee to proceed  with the work of establishing an air  base on a site to be reclaimed from the sea to the west of the British Neutral Ground.     LORD SWINTON explained that he desired the Committee to recommend the  taking of initial steps  towards  implementing the proposals for the air  base. He  pointed out that the Law Officers of  the Crown,  in a letter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated the 20th October, 1936,* stated that in  their opinion we had a prima facie case entitling us to take these  steps, although they could  not guarantee a favourable decision should the  matter  be brought before The Hague Court.  He observed that in their view the more the provision of the aerodrome could  be related to the needs of Gibraltar  as a fortress, the better our case would be. This was a very favourable point, since the General Staff of any country would have to admit that a great fortress should possess air facilities. which were in these days  a  vital necessity for it.   It was  true that, from our point of view, the aerodrome would be of greater importance in its capacity as a staging point for reinforcing aircraft, but it would  be necessary in stating our case, should  it come to that, that  we should make  as much  as possible of the importance of the aerodrome to the  fortress itself.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE  said that he  had  looked  into this question in considerable  detail during his  recent visit to Gibraltar.  The site which it was proposed to reclaim to  the west of the British Neutral Ground was really the only possibility.  The reclamation of such a  big area was certainly a large under- taking, but we have in the past carried out similar reclamation work, though on a smaller scale,  at Gibraltar, and there  should  be no  particular engineering difficulties. The site proposed would interfere to some extent with the commercial use of the Harbour, but not very seriously.  One difficulty was that the proposed site would bring the  aerodrome right up against  Spanish  Barracks  in  their territory. It would be essential, therefore, for the free use  of the aerodrome, to have a friendly Spain. The Spanish Government have never seriously protestedI at previous reclamation schemes, although admittedly none had been carried out adjacent to our Neutral Ground.  The aerodrome was essential to us not only from the defence point of view, but also  in connection with civil air routes.  He felt that we must be  prepared  to face the possible international  complications which might  arise,  and he  therefore supported Lord Swinton  in pressing  for  early action.                 * Subsequently circulated as C.I.D. Paper No. 429-C.        [14023-2]
    SIR ROBEET VANSITTART considered that the matter should, in anycase, be referred to the Cabinet, owing to the political issues involved.  It was highly probable that a  Government led by  General Franco would  emergetriumphant  from the Civil War, and such  a Government would undoubtedlyobject to the scheme.  It was to be expected that Italy would actively support themin their objections.  He felt, therefore, that it would be better to try to come tosome arrangement with General Franco&apos;s Government than to be taken to courtover the matter either at The Hague or at Geneva, since the latter course wouldcertainly involve very long delays.   We might,  therefore,  gain more time bywaiting a little  until a  stable Government  was established in Spain and  thenattempting to make some friendly arrangement with it.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked what the Law Officers meant by  the phrase&quot;initial steps&quot;  in  the last paragraph of their letter.    LORD  SWINTON  said he understood  this to mean the issuing of tendersand starting work on the site.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN thought that it would be unwise to go so far as toplace  contracts and then have to deal with objections by the Spanish Government.He agreed that it was necessary to  put the scheme through, but thought that afull Appreciation  of  the political factors involved  should  be  prepared by theForeign Office and that we should proceed with some caution in the matter.    SIR ROBERT VANSITTART stressed the probability of avoiding delayif we waited until  the Franco Government was established in Spain.  general franco  would, no  doubt, want to obtain our  assistance and support  in  manymatters, and it would be a good opportunity to say to him that we were proposing to proceed with  the reclamation scheme then.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE enquired what would happen supposing general franco made difficulties.  He trusted  that this would not mean abandoning thewhole scheme.    MR. ORMSBY GORE thought there was every chance of getting the schemethrough without serious opposition from Spain,  if we proceeded in the waysuggested by Sir Eobert Vansittart.    LORD SWINTON agreed that an Appreciation by the Foreign Office of thepolitical factors involved was obviously desirable.  The real problem  was to find the best way of implementing the scheme with the  least possible delay.    SIR  SAMUEL HOARE  doubted  whether we should find any SpanishGovernment at all forthcoming in this matter.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that we might have to face the possibilityof the Spaniards retaliating  by reclaiming  an area adjacent  to their  NeutralGround alongside the aerodrome.    LORD  SWINTON enquired whether the Committee would agree to the AirMinistry calling for -tenders for the scheme.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN thought that it  would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to keep the matter secret if tenders were called for.  He thought itwould be most unwise.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a) That the provision of an air base at Gibraltar is essential for the needs           of Imperial defence.    (&amp;) That the only practicable site for an aerodrome is that of the proposed           reclamation on the west side of the British Neutral Ground.    (c) To  take note that  reclamation  work on the site proposed  will almost           certainly cause reactions in Spain, whatever Government may  be in           power.    (d) To take note that in the opinion of the Law Officers we have a prima facie           case to take whatever initial steps are considered appropriate pending           objection by the Spanish Government.
(e) That the best method of  carrying through  the scheme, whether by      proceeding at once without any reference to Spain or by waiting to      negotiate with whatever Spanish Government emerges from the present      Civil War, is a question of policy which can only be decided by the      Cabinet.(/) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to circulate to the      Cabinet  an Appreciation of the political factors  involved in such a      decision by the Cabinet.(g) To  ask  the Secretary to  submit  the  Committee&apos;s  recommendations,      together  with the opinion of the Law Officers of  the Crown and all      other relevant Papers, for the consideration of the Cabinet.(h) That no steps toward implementing the scheme should be taken by the      Air Ministry pending the Cabinet decision referred to in (e).   -K-                                                        ^2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,      October 29, 1936.
COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.GIBRALTAR AS A LINK IN IMPERIAL AIR  COMMUNICATIONS.       THE PROBLEM OF  ESTABLISHING  AN AIR  BASE.                    (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 388-C.) Memorandum by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence  Sub-Committee of the                       Committee of Imperial Defence.     THE Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee have recently had under consideration the problem of establishing an air base at Gibraltar. Necessity for an Air Base at Gibraltar.     2.&apos;  The serious gap in our system of Imperial air  communications which results from the interposition of foreign territory between  England and Egypt has long been accepted as inevitable and irremediable under prevailing conditions. The circuitous oversea route round the western extremities of France and Spain, and thence eastwards along the Mediterranean,  has  up to the present been impracticable for aircraft, owing to the limitations of flying range.  Gibraltar and Malta  are the  only British links between  the United Kingdom  and the Middle East, and the intervening  distances have so far been  too  great to be covered by any existing type of landplane or seaplane.     3.   But increases in range consequent on progress in the technical  develop- ment of aircraft have now reached a stage where the removal of  these difficulties is well within sight.  As regards  Service aircraft, we already  possess  a flying boat type capable of reaching Gibraltar from England (the longest stage in the route) in a  single flight, and in the near future  a large proportion of R.A.F. units at  home will be equipped with land planes of heavy and  medium bomber types capable of  the  same  achievement.  The strategic value of reinforcement flights along this route  is too obvious to require stressing, and, given sufficient aircraft endurance, the only other requirement is adequate landing grounds and refuelling facilities at Gibraltar and Malta.   The air base already established at  Malta provides facilities  for  both  land planes and  seaplanes.   Gibraltar, therefore, is the key to the route and to the whole strategic  conception  of Imperial Air Defence. . On the provision of an adequate intermediate air base at that port depends our ability to bridge the gap in our air communications for  many years to come.  An air base is also essential at Gibraltar for the operation of land planes and seaplanes engaged in trade protection and air defence.     4.  Recent occurrences have shown only too clearly how serious a threat exists to our sea communications in the Mediterranean in  the event of hostilities with  a first-class Mediterranean Power.   In such circumstances air reinforce- ments may be unable to  proceed by sea from the United Kingdom to the Middle       [13552]   .                                                  b              Printed for the Committee  of Imperial Defence.SECRET.

East (and thence, if necessary, onwards by the Imperial air routes) and vice versaotherwise than by the Cape route.   The consequent delays might vitally affect theopening phases of a campaign and would seriously embarrass us throughout a major war.    5.   Moreover, the provision of a land and sea aerodrome at Gibraltar couldnot fail to  be of great  advantage to civil aviation  also.  In the event of theMediterranean and Central Europe being closed  to us,  the  route via Gibraltarto West Africa would provide the only possible  means of linking up with the african and Eastern air routes.  Although it is apparent that in such a case thelong nights  involved would seriously reduce, if not entirely absorb, the pay loadnormally available, yet this fact would be of minor importance compared with theprime necessity of maintaining a line of communication which would be essentialto us  in the  circumstances envisaged.Difficulty of finding a suitable site.    6.   The problem  of finding a suitable site for an aerodrome and an air base at Gibraltar, however, presents many serious difficulties, arising primarily fromthe extremely restricted space available.   The Eock itself has no level groundwhich could be utilised  for the  purpose,  and it  is therefore  necessary to lookelsewhere.  It seems that there are only three possible sites :     (a) On  land to be acquired from Spain adjacent to British territory.    (b) On  the British Neutral Ground.    (c) On an area to be reclaimed from the sea.A  site on Spanish territory.    7.  The possibility of acquiring land from Spain was  investigated by theForeign  Office, and the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid on thequestion was  obtained.   The  prospects of success in this direction are remote.Spanish national feeling is extremely sensitive about our occupation of Gibraltar,and any attempt on our part to extend the area of our occupation would be bitterlyresented.  It seems that the price of Spanish consent to such a scheme would beso high as to be prohibitive, even if it were possible to offer some  adequate quidpro quo-scad, in fact, it is difficult to  think what offer we could make.   Evensupposing, however, the Spaniards could be induced to consider such a proposition,the negotiations would inevitably be prolonged and intricate, and serious delayswould occur  before work on the  construction of the air base could be started.Moreover, the defence of such a  base would raise very difficult problems.  TheCommittee do not, therefore, consider that any useful purpose would be served by further pursuing this line of enquiry.The British  Neutral Ground Site.    8.  An  emergency landing ground  for the Fleet Air Arm has recently beenprepared on the British Neutral Ground north of the Rock in accordance with a recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence  in  1933 (C.I.D. 258thMeeting, Minute 8). Apart from the political considerations involved, however,which are dealt with later on in this Memorandum, there are the  followingobjections to the use of this site as a permanent aerodrome :       (i) The British Neutral Ground comprises almost the only level ground in          the Colony, and the construction of an  aerodrome on it would involve          not only  the closing  of the rifle ranges,  but also the sacrifice of          practically all the training and recreational facilities of the garrison.     (ii) The width available is not enough to  provide  anything more  than  an          east-west runway.   There would therefore  be  many occasions&quot;  on          which it would be hazardous or impossible for aircraft to make use of          the aerodrome.  This would be particularly undesirable in a key aero-          drome used for long-distance flights, since there  is no other landing          ground near which aircraft could reach if,  when nearing the limit of          their endurance, they found landing conditions unsafe or impossible.          In the case of reinforcement flights of whole squadrons, this objection          would be of even greater weight.
     (iii)  The main road from Spain would have to be taken underground below           the aerodrome in a tunnel which would be below sea level and liable to           flooding.     (iv) There  would be no possibility of extending  the aerodrome except by           reclamation from the sea. It should be noted that, in any case, a small           strip on the western side would have to be reclaimed and added to the           existing ground  in order to give the necessary length. The Reclamation Scheme.     9.  In view of these difficulties in the way of the construction of an air base on any existing dry land at Gibraltar, the Committee considered that the proposal for using an area reclaimed from the sea should be examined, and invited the Air Ministry  to go into it in detail. A reconnaissance was carried out, and several possible schemes investigated.  The scheme which the Air Ministry recommended, after detailed examination of all the possible alternatives, was the reclamation of the area shown on the attached map to the north-west of the Rock at Commercial Harbour.   This area would  provide a landing ground suitable for all winds, with a maximum length of 1,100 yards, and a minimum of 600 yards in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction, i.e., the ones which aircraft would use least often in view of the direction of the prevailing winds.  Space would also be  available for aerodrome buildings, workshops,  barracks, &amp;c,  without  disturbing  existing accommodation.   It is  estimated  that  the  reclamation  of  this area could  be accomplished without any special difficulties from the engineering point of view within a period of two years, at an approximate cost of  451,000.   It should be understood that the scheme  is flexible within certain limits as regards the actual area  to be reclaimed, and that it is not necessarily confined exactly to the boundaries shown on the map. Legal Difficulties vis-a-vis Spain.     10.  So  far only the technical and topographical factors involved  in this problem have been considered.  But there are also political considerations in this matter which are perhaps of overriding importance.  These arise mainly from the fact that the legal position  regarding  our rights in the British Neutral Ground and the territorial  waters round the whole Colony  is not free from doubt.  The questions at issue were examined by the Foreign Office and explained to the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee in considerable detail.   Briefly, it appears that the Spanish Government have never explicitly acknowledged that we possess any rights in the British Neutral Ground, nor even in the waters adjacent to the Colony itself. Rightly or wrongly, we have exercised such rights, with very little serious protest from Spain, ever since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713  in the case of the territorial waters, and since 1838  in the case of what is now known as the British Neutral Ground.  But there has never, so  far as can be seen, been any agreement  between the two countries on these  points, and both sides have been content to maintain their own views in principle and to avoid, so far as possible, any open dispute.  It seems probable, therefore, that in law we should have a strong case for maintaining that we had  acquired these rights by  prescription.  It is necessary, however,  to anticipate  the  possibility, or even the  probability,. that should any scheme be launched which would raise the definite issue,  the Spanish Government would  make our action a diplomatic issue and might even demand that the  whole question should  be referred  to  the  Permanent  Court  of International Justice at The Hague.  The reclamation scheme, therefore, has the disadvantage that  whatever may be our legal title to the Neutral  Ground, our title to an area reclaimed from the sea adjacent to it cannot be better, and since our title to territorial waters anywhere at Gibraltar is not admitted by  Spain, it may be worse. The risk of obtaining an unfavourable decision when there aretwo uncertain factors, as in this case, must necessarily be somewhat greater.Special Considerations regarding the Territorial Water Issue.    11.  While the question of our rights in the British Neutral Ground depends on a comparatively clear issue (i.e., whether our prescriptive claim would prevail),      [13552]                                                     B 2
 the question of the extent of territorial waters is a good deal more complicated. On the  assumption,  however, that  the  International  Tribunal  found  in  our favour regarding rights  in the Neutral  Ground, it is considered,  though it is impossible to forecast with any certainty what award would be made, that the Spanish thesis (i.e., that we  possess no  territorial waters at all  at  Gibraltar) would be unlikely to be upheld and that  the award would probably be based on some division of the waters starting from the point at  which  the northern boundary of the British  Neutral Ground reaches the sea on  the  western side. Three possible dividing lines on such a basis are shewn on the attached map.  Of these the &quot; worst case&quot; indicated by the straight line C-D is perhaps unlikely to be chosen.  In this case, however, it would not be possible to provide an area of the required  dimensions without encroaching on  the North Front and the British Neutral Ground, though from the purely  engineering point of view there would be no difficulty. Disadvantages of the Probable Award regarding Territorial Waters.    12.   It should be pointed out that the territorial  waters at Gibraltar  so far claimed  by His  Majesty&apos;s Government extend considerably beyond any of the three lines on the attached map, and that since 1826 we have never admitted any Spanish claim to jurisdiction east of a line drawn from Punta Mala.  Any of the decisions envisaged  on  the map would therefore involve  a  considerable restriction of the water area in which His Majesty&apos;s Government at present claim and exercise territorial jurisdiction, and any of them would place a large section of the existing commercial anchorage under Spanish sovereignty.   Apart from any difficulties in peace time which would follow from such a decision, relatively serious complications  might well arise in any  future war in which we were belligerent and Spain  neutral.   In the last war  there was insufficient accommo- dation within the harbour for all the shipping calling at Gibraltar.   It was, in fact,  found impossible to avoid using anchorages, at  times even west of Punta Mala, for purposes, inter alia, of convoy assembly and to  accommodate vessels sent in for examination for which there was no room in the examination anchorage. It is  thought improbable that, in any future major European war at least, we should be able to forgo the use of these anchorages for similar purposes again.    13.   The  following   are  suggested,  therefore,  as  exemplifying  the disadvantages which might result in war time if there had been a binding award on the lines  contemplated :-     (a) it would be more  difficult for Spain to resist pressure from our enemy to           deny us by force the use of waters outside the award limits  (though           it is considered unlikely that any attempt to do so would be made).    (b) in any event, if Spain were apprehensive about her neutrality, continued           friction and. protests would be inevitable.    (c) even if Spain made no serious protest, our use  of waters beyond the limit           for such purposes as are indicated above would provide a good excuse           for the enemy if he desired to make use of other neutral waters.    14.  Nevertheless, the Committee  are  of  opinion that the importance ofproviding an air base  at  Gibraltar is such as to necessitate our taking the risk that its construction may  lead to difficulties of this kind.  So long as there is noaward on the subject  no  serious difficulty is anticipated as we could probablyjustify our use of the waters in war time on the grounds of pur prescriptive rightsand any dispute  would most likely be held over  until the end of  hostilities forjudicial settlement, if  this was insisted on.Possibility of minor infringements of Spanish territorial air.    15.  There is a further minor difficulty of a political nature  which would arise  whether the aerodrome were established on the Neutral Ground or on thereclaimed area.  In  certain states  of the wind  Spanish  territoriality mightoccasionally be infringed  by aircraft on their way to and from the aerodrome.Such infringements would be infrequent and only momentary, and it is consideredthat if the Spanish Government objected  the matter could be dealt with by theordinary methods of diplomatic protest and apology.
Conclusions.    16.  The opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown on all the legal questionsis  to be obtained by the Foreign Office,  and the final decision cannot of course be made until this opinion has been received.  It was  strongly represented tothe Committee by the Air Ministry, however, that the whole scheme must be putin hand with the least possible delay if the construction  of  the air  base at gibraltar is  to proceed concurrently  with the provision of  aircraft capable ofmaking use of it.  The  Committee therefore considered the  proposals which hadbeen submitted  on the assumption  that we  should  have a good case in  lawfor using either the Neutral Ground site or the area proposed for reclamationon the west of  it.   Such an assumption, in the view of the Foreign Office,  andsubject,  of course,  to  the opinion  of  the Law Officers,  was  by no meansunjustifiable.    The Committee  felt that the objections to the Neutral  Ground site were so serious that they could not recommend its use.  They therefore decided, in orderto avoid delay, to  seek  the approval in principle of the Committee of ImperialDefence, subject always to the overriding opinion of the Law Officers on the legal position, to the construction of an aerodrome on the reclaimed area, the exact size and shape of which would  have to be  determined at a later stage.                              SUMMARY. 17.  The position may be summed up as follows :   (i)  An air base is urgently required at Gibraltar  to  complete  the  chain       of air bases on the Imperial air route to the East, since the performance       of Service aircraft will shortly enable them to  reach Gibraltar in one       bound from home.  (ii)  The prospects of obtaining a site from  Spain  on Spanish territory       within a reasonable time,  if at all, are so remote as to be unworthy of       further consideration. (iii)  Use of the British Neutral Ground for the purpose is open to most       serious objections from the military, technical and topographical point       of view. (iv)  The reclamation of an  area from the sea on the west of the British       Neutral  Ground  offers by far  the  most satisfactory solution  of the       problem.  (v)  The legal position regarding British rights in the British Neutral       Ground and the territorial waters  adjacent is obscure.  Since Spain       might take  the question  to The Hague Court, the legal opinion of       the Law Officers  of the Crown on the matter is  necessary.  This is       to be obtained.  (vi)  Meanwhile three possible  lines  for  an award  by  The  Hague Court       regarding the division of  territorial waters are shown on the attached       map.  In the worst  case, which is considered unlikely  to arise, it       would not be possible to reclaim a sufficient area without encroaching       on the British Neutral Ground a course which, to a greater or lesser       extent,  would  be open to the  objections  referred to in  sub-para-       graph (iii) above. (vii)  So long as there is  no award on the subject  no serious  difficulty is       anticipated, but an award regarding the extent of territorial waters       on the lines considered likely would restrict our use of anchorages in       the commercial harbour, and might have certain real disadvantages in       a war in which we were belligerent and Spain neutral.  Unless,       however, overwhelming objections on this score emerge  upon receipt       of the  Law Officers&apos; opinion,  the Committee consider that  these       disadvantages should not be allowed to prejudice the scheme for an       air base, which is of the utmost importance.(viii)  There is  a possibility of occasional minor  infringements of Spanish       territoriality by aircraft using the air base, but the Committee consider       that these would  not be sufficiently serious as to be  difficult of settle-       ment by ordinary diplomatic means.
s(ix) The Committee  recommend that,  subject  always to  the  overriding      opinion of the Law Officers on  the  legal position, and  to  further      consideration of the financial aspects of  the scheme when a closer      estimate of the total  cost  of  the air base has  been framed,  the      Committee of  Imperial  Defence  should  approve  in  principle  the      scheme  for the establishment of an air base at Gibraltar on a site      reclaimed from the  sea,  as  shown on the attached map, or such      modification of  it as may be necessitated by the legal determination of      the boundary between British and Spanish territorial waters, with the      proviso that the matter shall be reconsidered before any  scheme is      finally decided which  necessitates encroachment  upon the  British      Neutral Ground or North Front.

Copy No. 20COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 281s  Meeting, held on Jidy 30, 1936. (1)-GIBRALTAR AS A LINK IN IMPERIAL AIR COMMUNICATIONS :         THE PROBLEM OF ESTABLISHING AN AIR BASE.                         (OLD. Paper No. 424-C.)     (Previous reference:  OLD. Minutes of the 258th Meeting, Minute 8.)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee (OLD. Paper No. 424-C)  submitting certain proposals for the establishment of an air base at Gibraltar.     SIR MAURICE HANKEY, Chairman  of the Joint  Oversea  and Home    , Defence Committee, introduced the Memorandum at the request of the Chairman. He explained that the rapid development in aircraft makes the early provision of an air base at Gibraltar essential in order to complete our strategic air route to the East in which Gibraltar was a key point. It had not been possible before for service aircraft to reach Gibraltar  in one flight, but the provision of aircraft which would be able to accomplish this was now well within sight.  The problem of finding ground for an aerodrome at Gibraltar, however,  was a difficult one. Four possibilities had been considered.  The use of ground obtained  from Spain was one possible solution, but after examination by the Foreign Office this had been ruled out.  The possibility of reclaiming an area on the east side of the Rock had also been considered, but  there were serious  technical  objections from the air point of view to such a site, owing to the air currents from  the Rock.  The only flat ground in British hands was on what was known as the British Neutral Ground.   An  aerodrome on this ground  would not  be satisfactory from  the air point of view, and moreover it would involve the closing of the  rifle ranges and the loss of all the ground available for training and recreational purposes at  Gibraltar.   The  fourth  possible  solution,  which  seemed  to be  most promising,  was  that  of  reclaiming an  area,  as shown on the map  attached to  the Paper under  consideration, on  the west  side of the British  Neutral Ground at an estimated cost  of  about   451,000.   In this  there would be no technical difficulties, but there would  be certain political and legal difficulties. Our legal rights in the British Neutral Ground and in the waters adjacent to Gibraltar are obscure, and have  never been satisfactorily settled with Spain. We have, however, enjoyed our  rights in the surrounding waters ever since the Treaty of  Utrecht,  and in the  British Neutral  Ground  for  about  the lasthundred years.   Nevertheless, there was a possibility that Spain would take us to the Hague Court over the question.  The Foreign Office,  however, were ofopinion that we should have a very good case in law  as having acquired these rights by prescription, though it would be necessary, of course, to obtain the Law Officers&apos; opinion on this matter.  Should the  case go to the Hague  Court, andthe international boundary in  the territorial waters adjacent  to  the  BritishNeutral Ground be definitely  determined,  there was the  possibility that  ourpresent use of the Commercial Harbour would be interfered with.   Three possiblelines for this boundary were shown on  the sketch map.   In the last War we hadin fact used, without protest from Spain, the water to the north of these possibleboundaries, and to be deprived of it would be a serious inconvenience.  Therewas, therefore, a definite risk that the final settlement of the  boundaries by anInternational Court would jeopardise our whole position in those waters.  Shouldthe line marked as C-D on the sketch map be decided by the Court as the boundary,      [13614-1]
which would be the worst case, it would not be possible to carry out the schemeexactly as shown on the map, and it would then be necessary to encroach to someextent  on the British Neutral Ground to obtain the  necessary space for an aerodrome.  The Joint Oversea and  Home  Defence Committee therefore recom-mended that the Committee of Imperial Defence should approve in principle  ascheme for the establishment of an air base,  subject to the various provisos whichwere set out in the last sub-paragraph of the Memorandum.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP enquired whether it was possible that the decisionof the  Court would  be that  we had no rights at all in the territorial  watersadjacent to  the British Neutral Ground.    LORD  SWINTON said that he  understood such a decision was conceivable,but we had very strong prescriptive rights in the British Neutral Ground and inthe territorial waters, which  the  Court could hardly ignore.  He  wished  theCommittee to declare that the provision of an aerodrome at Gibraltar was a vital necessity to  us. The difficulties over  sending air forces out to the East had beenclearly shown during the recent emergency.   He wished  to emphasise most strongly that if no aerodrome were provided at Gibraltar, the value of the new developments in aircraft would  be  very largely sterilised  so far  as we were concerned.   Short of using  the  British  Neutral  Ground, which  would be technically unsatisfactory anyway, apart from  other  reasons,  the reclamationscheme was  the only possible one.  He asked that the matter should be treated as of the  greatest urgency,  and that the Law Officers&apos; opinion should be obtainedwith the least possible delay.    MR. EDEN said  that the Foreign Office would submit the case  to the LawOfficers as quickly  as possible, but the Department concerned was naturally hard-pressed at the moment owing to the situation now prevailing in Spain.  He  didnot wish any actual work to be started at, Gibraltar on the scheme until the LawOfficers had given  a favourable opinion as to our legal position.    MR. RAMSAY  MACDONALD  enquired  whether seaplanes  would also beable to use Gibraltar.  It was obvious that  if an air base could be provided, thevalue of Gibraltar would  be very greatly increased. He wished to be assured thatthe area proposed  was sufficiently large for the purposes of a first-class air base.    LORD  SWINTON  said  that the  technical aspects  of the question hadreceived  the most careful  consideration in the  Air  Ministry,  and  they were satisfied  that  the reclamation  scheme  would provide  adequate  facilities.Seaplanes could still use  the Harbour.    SIR SAMUEL  HOARE said that  the Admiralty were in  favour of  thereclamation scheme.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed *   (a) To approve in principle the scheme proposed in the Memorandum for the          establishment of an air base at Gibraltar on a site reclaimed from the          sea, as  shown in the map attached, subject to the overriding opinion          of the Law Officers on the legal position, and to further consideration          of the financial aspects when a closer estimate of the total cost had          been framed.    (b) That the Foreign Office should obtain  an opinion from the Law Officers          as soon as possible and as a matter of urgency.    (c) That no actual work should be started at Gibraltar until the Law Officers          had given  a favourable opinion as to our legal position.    (d) That, should a modification of the scheme be necessitated  by the legal          determination of the boundary between British and Spanish territorial          waters, which would involve encroachment upon  the British Neutral          Ground and North Front,  the matter should be again referred through          the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee to the Committee of          Imperial Defence for consideration.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,       July 30, 1936.

Royal Courts of Justice,Sir,                                             &apos;        October 20, 1936.    WE  were honoured with your commands  signified to us  in  Mr.. WalterRoberts&apos;  letter*  of the 18th September, 1936,  requesting our  opinion on thequestion whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could successfully  establish  their right to  carry out a  proposal for the reclamation of land from the  sea at gibraltar for the purpose of a military aerodrome.    We have taken the matter into our consideration  and, in obedience to yourcommands,  have  the honour  to REPORT     THAT we think that the question to be considered first is whether the BritishGovernment could construct the air base on the existing British  neutral ground.We agree that a claim to do this can only be based on a jurisdiction acquiredsince  and independently of the  Treaty of Utrecht.  It was apparently in 1838that we pushed the line of sentries forward to the present boundary or thereabouts,and  &quot;we made  a great acquisition of Territory&quot;  (see Sir  Robert Gardiner&apos;sstatement, Bundle 2, pp. 4 and 5).  It is not clear whether  the Law Officers&apos;Opinion of 1838  was written with reference to the territory &quot; acquired &quot; in thatyear or such portions as had been occupied prior to that advance.  If it referredto the territory occupied in that year it looks as  if there must  have been some misunderstanding.    It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various  incidents which followed, butseventy years after this acquisition the  Note Verbale  of the 5th August, 1908,written with reference to the unclimbable  fence seems to disclaim any right inthe British Government to construct any &apos;&apos; military or defensive &apos;&apos;  work on theland.   This would be presumably on the basis that the land was neutral, andthe rights claimed were limited rights, though we think not very easy to define.Events during and since the war have undoubtedly  strengthened  the Britishclaim.  In particular we were shown a letter* of the 25th August, 1915, writtenwith reference to the landing of an aeroplane in the Spanish neutral area, which appears to  recognise  without objection the &quot; aeroplane  service  in  the saidfortress.&quot;   As we understand it the aeroplanes landed on  the area in question and the letter might be read as recognising this area as part of the fortress or atleast as agreeing to the use of the land for aeroplanes.    The  present proposal,  we understand, is  not only  to create necessary facilities for the  Fortress itself and its defence but to provide a base of strategicvalue to our defences  further afield.                              * Not reproduced.      [14011]
     Having considered the documents before us we think that each side might put its case in two ways.     The Spanish Government might claim, firstly, that the  land although inBritish occupation for ordinary  administrative purposes remained neutral, andthat although they had conceded or  acquiesced in its use for certain  defensive purposes connected with  the  Fortress in the past, they had a right to  give orwithhold their consent for any new work or fresh use.                  &apos; - ^ &apos;     Alternatively, if they must be taken to have conceded its use for any defensivepurpose  immediately  connected  with the  Fortress, the present  proposal, theywould say, went beyond such a concession.     The British Government would claim, firstly, that  the area had passed underfull British&apos; sovereignty.   They  would point to the de  facto  position and relyparticularly on events  during and since the  war.     Alternatively, they might put forward a claim that the air base was primarily for the defence of the  Fortress as a Mediterranean Fortress and could again relyunder this head on the past facts as  to aeroplanes using the land and  the letteralready referred  to.     Before stating our general  conclusion  we  will deal with the  other points raised. It is suggested, on the  assumption that  the land to be reclaimed is atpresent submerged by British territorial waters, that this  might entitle the BritishGovernment to claim greater rights over this area than they have over the presentarea.  We do not think this  suggestion sound.   On the contrary, we think thefact that it is necessary  to reclaim  land and that  such reclamation would, onthe British Governments case, diminish the area of Spanish Territorial waterswould assist  the  Spanish  Government in  their case.  No  doubt apart  fromspecial circumstances  a country  having possession of a territory  is entitled toreclaim land and  exercise over such  land the rights whether  of full or  limitedsovereignty which it possesses over  the territory to which the land is added.Special circumstances  might well be  held to exist in this case and the SpanishGovernment might further rely on the reclamation as  supporting the contention that the  British  Government  were making  a new claim.  The fact that on oneview the reclaimed land might cover a small portion of Spanish  Territorial waterscan, we think, be  disregarded.    We are asked whether the British Government could successfully establishtheir claim before an International Tribunal.  The only certainty we feel aboutthe matter is that the case is a  difficult one and on the evidence before us theissue is doubtful.  There is evidence to support either view and an international tribunal in a case like this  which  raises  very difficult issues  in  very specialcircumstances has necessarily  a considerable latitude to give  more or less weight to this or  that consideration.  If a clear assurance is desired that the  BritishGovernment case would succeed we could not give such an assurance.  If all thatis required is an assurance that the British  Government  have a prima facie caseentitling them to take  whatever initial steps are considered appropriate pendingobjection by the Spanish Government, we think they have such a case.  We thinkit would be premature and of little value if we  attempted to express an opinon as to chances of success until  the nature and basis of the Spanish Government&apos;s objections,  if any, have been disclosed.   The more the scheme can be related tothe actual  needs of the Fortress,  although the base may incidentally be availablefor other purposes, the greater will be the chances of success.                                                 We have, &amp;c.                                       (Signed)      D. B.  SOMEEVELL.                                                      T. 0&apos;CONNOR.
