Exports of United Kingdom products,  41=8  m.,    were  1 = 9 m. more and re-exports,  4.5 m. ,  were  262,000  less    than in October, 1935-         EMPLOYMENT.  The total number of unemployed persons  on&apos; the    registers at 26th October, 1,611,810, was 12,529 les3 than at    21st September.  The main variations were:-           Londono o o r. o o o o c +10.834   Northwestern  -6,266           South Eastern, . -t- 8,108   Northerno ....  +  624           South Western,. * 7,697   Scotland.....  -8,240           Midlands.. o. o.. -16,398   Wales. .......  -t-1,408           North Eastern.. -10,2^6         The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 in    employment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,103,000,    21,000 more than at 21st September and 599,000 more than at    21st October, 1936.         Employment (as compared with September) improved in the    coal mining, engineering,  shipbuilding and repairing, metal    goods, wool textile, cotton, hosiery^  textile bleaching,    dyeing etc., and fishing industries and in most of the clothing    trades and certain food preparation trades.  Employment declined    in the hotel, boarding house, etc., service, building and public    works contracting, and the transport and distributive trades.         RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  In  the four weeks ended 25th October,    railway traffic receipts increased by  529,000 (4.55$) compared                                 -i-
with the corresponding period of 1935.  Passenger trafficincreased by 6.55^, merchandise, minerals and livestock by4.02/ and coal, coke and patent fuel by 1.63%     SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING-.  The general outlook for shipping is more encouraging, although for a complete revivala considerable increase in international trade is stillneeessaiy.  The Chamber of Shipping index number of freight rates (1915 ^ 100) was 110,73 as against 103.76 in september and 93.97 a year ago.  The shipbuilding outlook is in generalbetter than for a long time,     BANKING.  Money was in considerable demand throughoutOctober and was scarce outside the Clearing Banks,  The averageTreasury Bill rate fluctuated between 10/6007 and 11/5.44.  Theprice of gold (now variable with the dollar) moved between140/5?,- and 142/4-g-, with a tendency to rise throughout the month:there were signs of realisations by hoarders0  The francremained on the whole fairly steady around 105 (with extremefluctuations between 103 and 106-g-) but a weaker tendency was indicated by a rise in the forward rate from % to    discountand occasional official intervention.,  The dollar was in gooddemand, the rate appreciating from 4.93% &quot;to 4.88z, with a continuous premium on the forward dollar,,     COALo  The average weekly output of coal during the13 weeks ended 24th October was 4.36 m. tons as compared with.19 m. tons in the corresponding period a year ago - anincrease of 4.2%o  The average number of wage-earners employedwas slightly more than a year before  Exports in Octoberamounted to 3023 m. tons as compared with 3.29 m. tons inOctober, 1935.  There were no exports to Italy, as comparedwith 105,000 tons a year ago.  Countries taking less includedSpain, Egypt and Canada.  The chief increases were to the scandinavian countries and Germany.
Demand for pig-iron expanded steadily.   Rationing of suppliescontinued hut current requirements were, with rare exceptions,being met,  Spanish ore supplies may be stopped, but the re-opening of two ore mines in North-west England should ease theposition.  Pig-iron output (670,300 tons) was 23% greater thanin October, 1935, and crude steel production (1,060,500 tons)was 17% more.  Most works producing semi-finished steel operatedto capacity.  In the &quot;finished&quot; section, demand for structuralsteel was particularly heavy.  Overseas enquiry continued toimprove.     Total exports of iron and steel were 194,000 tons, comparedwith 183,000 in September and 219,000 a year before,     Scotland.  Large orders were being received following aslight check in new business towards the end of October.Pressure to obtain semi-finished steel was unrelaxed.  There wasa revival in export demand for steel, particularly plates andsectional materials.     North East Coast.  Home demand for all classes of iron andsteels continued active.  Preparations were being made for afurther  increase in output of semi-finished steel.     Sheffield.  The whole of the&apos; very large production of basicbillets was passing into immediate consumption.  Special alloysteels were in increasingly heavy demand.  Some relief should be afforded by an expansion of steel output now taking place.Makers of railway wheels, axles, etc., were working overtime.     South Wales.  Business in heavy steel products was particularly active.  Tinplate mills were busier, export ordersshowing  a marked improvement;  makers generally are well bookodup for the next few months.     ENGINEERING.  Favourable progress was made during october and the  volume of new business booked continued very satisfactory
The continuous expansion is, however,, presenting specialtechnical and other problems which will take time to solve, and manufacturing costs tend to rise.  Exports of machinery werevalued at  3,59 m. as compared with  3068 is, in October, 1935.Imports were  1.61 m.,   380,000 more than a year ago;  machine tools accounted for about half this increase.     MOTOR INDUSTRY j.  The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered in September was 29,753 - 4,238 more than a year ago;the increase in private cars was 2,526.  The production of private cars in August was 18,351 as against 20,594 in August, 1935, butthe production of commercial vehicles increased from 6,483 to7,539.  Exports of new private cars and chassis in Octoberamounted to 6,389 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to1,784 - 8$ and 69$ respectively more than in October, 19350868 complete new private cars and taxis were imported as comparedwith 582 a year ago.     LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.  Activity was maintained, except inthe fishing tackle trade where there was a seasonal slackening.There was still a shortage of skilled labour in the foundry trade.     ELECTRICAL__INDUSTRY.  The recent improvement was fullymaintained, although shortages of skilled men and of certain rawmaterials were causing difficulties.  The index of heavyengineering orders was nearly double that for October, 1955.Consumption of electricity amounted to 1,860 m. units - 12*7%more than a year ago.     COTTON.  There was a substantial (and more than seasonal)increase in activity.  Average weekly deliveries of  raw cottonto spinners were 27.6 m. lbs. as  compared with 23.2 m. lbs. inSeptember and 25.6 m. lbs. in October, 1935.  Yarn productionamounted to nearly 80$ of spinning  capacity, as compared with73$ in September.  Raw cotton prices tended  slightly  downwards.Spinners&apos; margins were scarcely affected  in  the American  section                            -4-
but probably widened in the Egyptian.  Yarn exports at 13 m. lbs.were 1.2 m, more than in September and .5 m.  more than inOctobers, 1935.  Exports of piece-goods at 178 m,  sq.yds.  were24 m. so.,yds. more than in September and greater than in any month since March, 1935.  Exports increased to most of theimportant markets, those to British Vest Africa being 12.6 e.sq. yds. more than in September.  The only countries takingsubstantially less were India and Argentina.     SILK AND ARTIFICIAL. SILK.   Demand for rayon yarns remainedquiet but the general tone is considered satisfactory.  business in staple fibre slightly improved.  Trade in rayon piece goodsslackened considerably.  Compared with October, 1935, exportsof rayon yarns and piece goods  increased substantially.        f     In  the silk trade business was slow.  Raw silk priceshardened slightly,     WOOLc  The increase in general activity was maintained,both woollen and worsted sections sharing in the improvement.Exports of tops and yarns increased as compared with September,but exports of tissues declined.  Raw wool prises hardenedfurther.  New orders and enquiries were well maintained.     HIDES AND LEATHER.   The hide market was only moderatelyactive but became much steadier towards the  end of October.European prices were settling down after  the disturbance causedby the currency devaluations.   It is reported  that owing to  the rising cost of raw materials, shoe prices must be  raised, ifquality  is to be maintained.     RETAIL TRADE.   The money  value  of  retail sales  inSeptember was 4.5/ greater than in September,  1935.   Sales offood and perishables rose by  7.4$, and of other merchandise  by1.2^i.  Preliminary returns for  October show  a  moderate increase as compared with  October, 1935.     CANADIAN TRADE.  The improvement in  economic  conditions
continued in September.   The index of the physicalvolume of business was higher than at any time sinceearly 1930.    Total imports increased,  but exportsaccroased as compared with August.    Raw cotton andwool imports rose, but imports of bauxite, crude rubber and petroleum declined.   Exports of copper and zincdeclined but nickel exports increased substantially.   Theiron, and steel and paper and lumber industries were more active and newsprint production increased.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE.   The wool position remainedsatisfactory and competition was keen,  despite theabstention of Japanese buyers.    1,006,000 bales were received into store from 1st July to 30th September ascompared with 967,100 a year before, the quantity sold orshipped being 266,000 and 256,300 respectively.  wheat and flour shipments from 1st December,  1935, to27th October were equivalent to 88.4 m. bushels of wheatas against 93.3 m. a year ago.    Butter shipments from 1st July to 31st October were 19,400 tons as compared  with19,200 a year ago.   Imports of merchandise during september amounted to  8.83 m.  (Australian currency)  ascompared with  8.17 m. a year^before.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.    Imports in August were 14$greater than in August, 1935.   Exports (excluding gold)were slightly more, shipments of diamonds, wool and fruitincreased substantially, but sugar and maize fell heavily.Gold output was greater than in August, 1935;  exportsincreased by 45$.   prospects for the wool season are  good.     SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.   All South American countries were benefiting from  the world rise in commodity prices.     Argentina.   The economic outlook was very favourable.Stocks of old crops were moving into consumption at good                         -6-
prices and growing crops promised very satisfactoryharvests.   Shipments of maize, cotton ond fruit during thefirst nine months of 1956 wore considerably more than a yearago, and exports of live-stock products also rose;   linseedshipments doclinod.    The estimates of areas sown to wheat,linseed and maize show large increases over last year.    Thenew wool clip was being readily disposed of at advancingprices.     Brazil.    There were general signs of increasingprosperity.   Coffee business was brisk at rising prices and the tone was optimistic following an agreement ss to prices and exports &quot;which is believed to have boon reached ata recent Conference of American producing countries.  Cotton ,exports during the first eight months of 1936 were 43$ in volume more than a year ago.     Chile.   The foreign exchange position continueddifficult.    Crop prospects were favourable.    TheUnited Kingdom share of the import trade during January-August,  1936, was 13.51$ as compared with 20.08$ a year before.     Uruguay.   The outlook for growing crops was satisfactory.   Cattle were in good demand at satisfactoryprices.    General business was\good.     Colombia.     Coffee exports during January-August were rather more than a year before.  The Central Bank predicteda favourable trend of commerce.     Peru.    Overseas trade during January-July showedfurther expansion.     Ecuador.   Since exchange control was imposed, serious difficulty has been experienced in effecting remittances ondocumentary collections.     Venezuela.    The commercial situation showed a slightseasonal improvement.                            -7-
     Bolivia.    The low level of tin exports,  on  whichthe country largely depends,  causes concern.    exchange control and some import prohibitions have  been imposed.J
