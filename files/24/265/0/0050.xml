This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys                    Government.SECRET.CP.330 (36)                           Copy No.  &amp;l                     CABINET                                    i                                    i SITUATION IN NORTH WAZIRISTaN ON THE NCR TH WEST FRONTIER                       OF INDIA.       Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.         It may be of interest to my colleagues to have a brief account of the events connected with the attacksmade by local tribesmen on British forces in NorthWaziristan, and the measures which the Government ofIndia are taking to deal with the resulting situation.         The trouble occurred in the lower KhaisoraValley, which runs south of and parallel to the TochiValley between the Razmak road on the west and theadministered Bannu District on the east.         In 1935 the Tori Khel tribe inhabiting this region entered into an agreement that, in return for anincrease in their allowances, they would permit fullaccess to this part of their country and give noharbourage to outlaws or persons hostile to theGovernment.  This year the faqir of Ipi, a fanatic living in the Tochi Valley, has been active in stirring upunrest in connection with the case of a minor Hindu girlalleged to have been converted to Islam.  In April last aMuhammadan was put on trial and subsequently convicted  onthe criminal  charge of kidnapping this girl,  and thePaqir attempted to lead a tribal lashkar down theKhaisora Valley to Bannu to bring pressure on theauthorities in connection with the case.   Subsequently  the
- 2  -Faqir took refuge in the lower Khaisora, whence he continued anti-Government propaganda;   Efforts were madeto induce the Tori Khel to expel him or put an end tohis activities, but the leading men in the tribe,  whileadmitting their responsibility, professed themselvesunable to control him unless Government made somedemonstration in accordance with the rights secured bythe 1935 agreement.  It was accordingly decided to marchtroops through the area in order to stiffen the pro-Government party and check the influence of the Faqir.The Governor of the North West Frontier Province had come to the considered conclusion that, if such a demonstration were not made, the opposition which theFaqir was organising would so  increase as to cause muchgreater difficulties later on.  Moreover, since the tribe, with the exception of a minority, had recentlyshown itself very amenable, serious opposition, apartfrom sniping, was not anticipated.          On 25th November two columns marched eastwardand southward respectively from Damdil, on the rtazmakroad, and Mir Ali in the Tochi towards a rendezvous  inthe Khaisora Valley.-  Both columns, especially theformer, met with considerable opposition; the Damdilcolumn reached the place of rendezvous on the 25th, andthe Mir Ali column, which had a longer distance totraverse, on the 26th, after camping for the night about two miles north of it.  On the 27th the whole forcemoved northward to Mir Ali, and further fighting tookplace.          It is evident that the manner in which thetroops behaved and were handled was most creditable..  Inparticular, all the enemy&apos;s attempts to lay ambushes werefrustrated.  The Royal Air Force, co-operated mostsuccessfully with the columns.
                    - 3 -         The extent to which other tribes besides theTori Khel participated in the fighting is not yet knownwith certainty; but some Mat]suds from the Shaktu Valleyto the south joined in the attacks on the Damdil column,and it was reported that a few iviadda Khel from the upperTochi Valley had gone to the scene of the fighting,         It is clear that further action must be taken against the Tori Khel and any other tribal elementsassociated with them in this unprovoked attack on british troops moving in country where the tribeconcerned had  consented to give free access to british forces.  In a  telegram of the 27th November theGovernment of  India reported that they were preparingfurther operations by land and air forces in theKhaisora Valley, which it would take about eight or  ten days to organise; the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, Sir John Coleridge, will be in control of the operations, and will also be givenpolitical control, with the Resident  in waziristan ashis political  adviser; he has also been given discretion to-use the air arm,  in consultation with the politicalauthorities, to punish any tribes living elsewhere thanin the Khaisora Valley who are shown  to his satisfaction to have assisted the Tori Khel hostiles; this discretionwill extend to the bombing of villages from whichcontingents are clearly proved to have been  sent.  Inthis event  the usual warning to the  inhabitants  to evacuate the villages will be given.  As regards the ToriKhel themselves, the Government of India report  in atelegram of 30th November that an announcement  is to bemade to them that the  following terms will be imposed:-
                      - 4 -        (1)   A force will march into  the Khaisora Valley             and remain there  as long as Government             considers necessary;        (2)   a road or roads will  be  constructed to  and  in             the Khaisora Valley;        (3)   confiscation of rifles and other  penalties  at             the discretion of Government  will be  imposed;        (4)   if the troops are opposed in  any  way during             their entry into, and occupation  of, the             Khaisora Valley,  the  tribesmen  concerned  will             receive condign punishment and  their villages             and towers will be destroyed.            I am satisfied that the Government of India&apos;s   plans for dealing with the  situation are  sound, and with   the concurrence of the Foreign  Office I have sent a   telegram conveying approval of  them.  I have no doubt   that the authorities realise the importance of avoiding   any action which might lead to  a spread of  the trouble,   and, in the event of further opposition  to our troops  in   the Khaisora Valley, of restricting punitive action so   far as possible to the particular  elements  guilty of  it.   I have mentioned these assumptions in the telegram   conveying general approval  of the  Government of India&apos;B   proposals.                                              Z,INDIA OFFICE.   2nd December 1936.
