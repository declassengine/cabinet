APPENDIX.                                 -      &amp;(a) Letter from Dr. Chaim Weizmann to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,                          dated October 26, 1936.Dear Ormsby Gore,                                      October 26, 1936.  ,    THE departure of the Royal Commission for Palestine is, we take it, to beexpected in the near future, and having regard to the possibility that the proposalto suspend immigration during  the Commission^  enquiry  may yet be underconsideration by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  may I here indicate  the grave objections to which such a step seems to Us to be open ?  The very deep anxietywith which Jews throughout the world view this question has already been made clear in the course of Various interviews which have been granted both by yourselfand by Sir Arthur Wauchope to representatives of the Agency, but I should likebriefly to summarise our contentioris in this matter.    It is, in the first place, a sufficiently grave matter that many thousands of jews who would in normal circumstances have found a refuge in Palestine fromlands where the conditions uhdef which  they live are wellmigh desperate, should thus be arbitrarily excluded.  The matter goes far deeper than this, however, and.seems to us to involve a question of basic principle.  Any interference with thefundamental right which the Jews as a people feel to have been guaranteed tothem by international law the right to  immigrate into their homeland as far aseconomic circumstances permit will be felt by  Jews everywhere as an act of gross injustice and will  arouse widespread bitterness and resentment.  Following,moreover, on the prolonged period of suffering which the Jews of Palestine have,      [13996]
 with marked patience and restraint, endured during the last six months, such an action on the part of the Government would come as a crushing blow, and could only be regarded as placing a premium on methods of terrorism and violence.  It would foster the belief that such methods constitute an infallible political weapon, and would certainly be taken by the Arabs as a precedent encouraging the use of similar tactics whenever their demands remain unsatisfied.   The danger to the future of Palestine inherent in lending any colour  to such a belief can hardly be exaggerated.     It has been argued that immigration is one of the main questions  on which the Royal Commission  will have to adjudicate, and that, while that question is being investigated, no  new facts should be created.  Actually the continuance of immigration does not constitute a new fact, the normal  state of affairs in Palestine being one of uninterrupted immigration.   On the other hand, to suspend immigration pending the investigation would itself create a new fact, and would constitute a  radical departure from the  status quo.  To  deal in advance  with the immigration question in this way  is virtually to prejudge the issue; it must necessarily colour (and from the Jewish point of view,  colour adversely) the approach of the Commission to its enquiry on this most important  issue.     Prom  the economic  point of  view,  the consequences of a prohibition  of immigration during the coming months would be most serious.  The country has been subjected, as a result of the events of the last  half-year, to a period of very great economic strain.  To the process of reparation the import of new capital and  new workers is of vital importance.  In its recent application for a Labour Schedule in respect of the current half-year, the Jewish Agency has indicated the extent to which new workers are required.  The need for fresh capital is no lessurgent.   It is submitted that on this ground alone a suspension of immigrationat the present time would be in the highest degree deplorable.    May I express my  conviction, in conclusion, that such a step would impairconfidence in the work of the Royal Commission, without in any way serving toassist its enquiry?  I  sincerely trust,  and I believe that in this matter I speak on behalf of Jews in every country of the world, and of every shade of opinion,that the  proposal  in question, if considered at all, will not  be proceeded with.                                                  Yours sincerely,                                                       CH. WEIZMANN.(b) Personal and Secret Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to         the  High Commissioner for Palestine, dated October 21, 1936.    PERSONAL and Secret,    Thank  you for your personal telegram of  19th October.   The conclusionwhich I am putting to the Cabinet at their meeting next Wednesday is as follows:(1) Temporary suspension of immigration while the Royal Commission is at workand their report is under consideration would not be justified.  (2) At the sametime I consider it right, in present circumstances,  that the High commissioner should take a definitely conservative view in estimating the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine for fixing Labour Schedule for the period October to March.(3) I should  prefer not to specify a figure, as I do not wish to depart from thepractice which has always been followed of leaving  decision as to numbers to theHigh Commissioner; it  is, however,  probable  that on receipt of a  general direction  in  sense suggested above the High Commissioner will fix number of certificates for current schedule at (say) 2,000 or even less.    Please  inform  me  not later  than  the 27th October if  you have  anyobservations, more particularly on (3).    Question of disarmament (your despatch, Secret, of  the 16th October) willalso be considered by Cabinet next Wednesday.
(c) Secret and Personal Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to        the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated October 24,  1936.    IMPORTANT.  Secret and Personal.    Your secret and personal telegram of 21st October : Immigration.    (1) I agree as regards the first of your three conclusions.    (2) As regards the second, I have taken a conservative view and, in fact, thisview, according to advice and my judgment, is well founded on economic groundsalone, but it is impossible at present to have great confidence in forecasts.    (3) I propose, subject to your concurrence, to approve a labour schedule of1,800.  1,300 of these will be allotted  to Jewish Agency and 500 to ImmigrationDepartment.   Of figure 500, 300 are required for German Jewish  capitalistsalready in Palestine who have failed to transfer capital within specified periodof twelve months (see my confidential despatch, 3rd July, 1935, paragraph 3).  no increase of present population will thereby be involved.  Despatch follows.
