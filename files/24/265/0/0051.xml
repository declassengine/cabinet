BRUSSELS CONVENTION ON IMMUNITY OP                               &apos; &quot;STATE-OWNED SHIPS.                   Note by the president of  the Board of Trade.                 This  Convention was Before  the Cabinet in 1927             (CP.68(27)), when it was decided that , subject to             international agreement on  certain safeguards, the             Convention should be approved.   This agreement has been             obtained.                 A memorandum, agreed by the Lord Chancellor&apos;s             Department, the Foreign Office,  the Scottish Office, the             Treasury Solicitors and the Board of Trade, is attached             setting out what has  happened since  the Cabinet decision             referred to, and explaining the  position which has now             been reached.                 The advantages of such a Convention and the main             provisions of the present Convention  are stated in             paragraphs 1 to 5  of the memorandum.                 The Law Officers have  advised as to the             legislation which  should be passed by parliament before             H.M. Government could ratify the Convention and I would             draw the particular attention of my colleagues to             paragraphs 13, 14  and 15 of the  memorandum.                 To enable British Subjects  to sue  foreign States             in this country, one of the most important benefits             conferred  by the Convention, the Lav/ Officers have advised             that legislation is necessary to ensure that the Courts in             this country can entertain  claims against foreign States,             and that this legislation should take the form of Bills             amending the Supreme Court  of Judicature Act and the                                    -1-
relevant statutes in Scotland relating to  the Court  of session and Sheriff Courts.     But a more difficult point arises.  The  Lav/Officers advise that unless  the Crown is made, in law,liable for the torts of its  servants, so enabling foreignsubjects to sue the Crown here, the obligations containedin the Convention are not being strictly complied with inrespect of collision and salvage claims.   But they advise that as claimants in such cases do in fact get thecompensation contemplated by the Convention, H.M.Government \70uld on the whole be justified in ratifying the Convention without legislation so far  as such claimsare concerned.  (They advise that there is no need for legislation in respect of claims of a contractual nature).     The Law Officers add that, while in  their opinion it  -must be realised that the Government may be pressed to,comply fully and strictly with the terras  of theConvention, and in that event legislation  would benecessary, it may well be that no such objection will beraised.     If legislation were passed enabling foreign subjects to sue the Crown here for the torts of its servants, itwould be impossible to withhold the same right from BritishSubjects.  To give such a right to British subjects wouldinvolve a change of policy as regards the  Crown ProceedingsBill (paragraph 13 of the memorandum).  In thisconnection I attach to this  Note a copy of a letter datedthe 17th November 1936 which I have received from theLord Chancellor.     As H.M. Government have already decided in favourof ratification and as the Belgian Government have beeninformed accordingly I have  to ask my colleagues     (a) to authorise the formal ratification of the          Convention;  and     (b) to approve the preparation and submission to          Parliament of the  legislation indicated in          paragraph (5).
          I suggest that my colleagues should agree that,     having regard to the Lav/ Officers&apos;  opinions set out in     paragraph 14 of the memorandum and summarised above,     legislation to deal with claims made in this country     against vessels owned by H.M.  Government may be dispensed     with.          The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the     Secretary of State for Scotland as well as the Lord Chancellor     have concurred in these recommendations.                                             W.R.                                                               tBoard, of Trade,   4th December, 1956.
                                       Carter&apos;s Corner Place,                                            Hailsham,  Sussex.                                        17th November, 1936.My dear Walter,    Yours of the 3rd November has teen forwarded to me with itsenclosure.  I agree that, in view of the previous decisions of theCabinet, it is inevitable for us to authorise the formalratification of the Convention and to introduce the legislationmentioned in paragraph 5 of the memorandum.  I  think that,  in viewof the considerations set out in paragraph 14,  legislation to dealwith claims made in this country against Government owned vesselsmay be dispensed with.   But I desire, in view  of paragraph 13 of thememorandum, to call the attention of the Cabinet, and particularly of the Treasury, to the very serious consequences which may arise ifwe are compelled to introduce the Crown Proceedings Bill.    You and they will recall that .the Committee of proceedings against the Crown was set up in the Conservative Cabinet in orderto consider whether or not it was desirable to  assimilate proceedings against the Crown with those against the subject, and whether ornot it was desirable to give a remedy against the Crown in tort.Unfortunately, however, the Committee was hopelessly divided upon this question and, when Lord Haldane became Lord Chancellor,  healtered the terms of reference and asked the Committee toconsider assuming it was desirable, what form &quot;the legislation shouldtake, and what would be the necessary safeguards.  Consequently,there has been no consideration by any Committee or Cabinet of the major question.  The Committee in fact proceeded on Lord Haldane&apos;-terms of reference, and drafted a Bill which contained a number ofwhat they regarded as essential safeguards.    In fact in this country there is no real ground of complaint of any denial of justice against the Crown by reason of the existing law.  In all cases of contract, a claim can be  brought by petitionof right, and although the fiat of the Attorney General has to beobtained for its presentation, the Attorney General has invariably                             -4-
proceeded, upon the view that he has only to satisfy himself that the petition of right  discloses a prima facie case,axad thereupon the fiat issues as of course.  The refusal ofthe fiat, therefore, is confined only to cases where thereis no possible claim in contract, and the action is hopelesslymisconceived.  In actions of tort the procedure is as is pointed out in paragraph 2 of your memorandum, to nominate adefendant and for the Grown to pay the damages and costs awarded.But I think, myself, that the effect of changing the law wouldbe very serious.   There would be, in the first place,  a great number of unfounded claims, which would occupy the time and attention of the departments and which would involve the Crownin a great deal of expense, which could not &quot;be recovered.   But,in addition to that, if the Crown were made liable in tort,there would be an immense number of claims by everyone whohas a grievance against the executive.  For instance, a great number of acquitted prisoners would consider themselvesjustified in claiming damages for malicious prosecution andfalse Imprisonment;  people who were adversely commented onin Government publications would consider themselves justifiedin bringing actions for libel;  and. a great number of otherinstances might easily be given.   When these proceedingscame on, no doubt it is true that in the great majority ofcases they would be unsuccessful but again a great deal ofexpense and Government time would be spent on their defence.But, in addition to that, juries and some Judges would regard themselves as champions of the individual against the newdespotism, and would insist in the executive justifying itsconduct in court.  In fact, the executive would become responsible to the judiciary- instead of to Parliament, andwould have to prove its justification in a court of law onthe pain of being mulcted in heavy damages.  Further, the Crown                          -5-
Proceedings Committee set out a number of safeguards whichwere essential if the procedure against the Crown was to  heassimilated to that against subjects,  notably in claims fordiscovery;  and I doubt very much whether these safeguardswould survive the Committee Stage of legislation in parliament and whether the Crown proceedings Bill would not ultimatelytake the  form of assimilating the procedure and not affordingthe necessary safeguards.    I am sorry to worry you with this tirade, which is not immediately relevant, since I find myself in agreement with your specific recommendations.  But I do not think that itwould be right for me, holding the opinons which I do, not to let the Cabinet and the Treasury know what serious consequences may be involved if the fears entertained inparagraph 15 of your memorandum were realised.                            Yours ever,                             (Signed) HAILSHAM;Right Hon.  Walter Runciman,  M.P.
              BRUSSELS CONViSNTIOI-T ON IMMUNITY OF                      STAT.B-OMBD SHIPS.                         MEMORANDUM.   1. For many years the view has been strongly held byshipowners and others that the immunity enjoyed byState-owned ships from liability at the suit of private individuals and from legal process for the purpose of enforcing that liability was open to grave abuse.    Thereis not, and never has been, any serious complaint on thepart of ship-owning interests so far as the United KingdomGovernment is concerned, as in the case of ships owned bythe United Kingdom Government it is always the practice,     nalthough there is no legal liability on the part of the Grown,to assume responsibility for collision and salvage claims,whilst, in cases of contract, it has been possible toproceed in England by way of Petition of Right and inScotland under the Crown Suits (Scotland) Act, 1856, and  theAdmiralty Suits Act, 1858.   2. In collision cases the person legally liable is  theofficer in charge of the vessel at  the time of the collisionand  it has always been the practice of the Crown to furnish the  claimant with the name of this  officer so thatproceedings may be taken against him.   If damages areawarded against this officer, the Crown pays the damages  soawarded, subject to the limitation  of  liability which  wouldbe available in respect of the ship if she were privately owned.   In salvage claims the usual practice of the Crownwhen such a claim is made  in respect of  services to one  ofits  ships is, following the procedure usually adopted  in commercial cases, to refer the assessment  of the award tothe  arbitration of one of  the Counsel practising in the
                                                           2P* AAdmiralty Court and to pay the amount awarded,   3. On the other hand, many foreign governments assert theirimmunity from legal process and have made use of this immunityfor the purpose of evading payment of just claims against them by private individuals.   The desirability of aninternational Convention on the matter was strongly pressedupon successive governments in this country by the ship-owninginterests.   4. In April 1936, a Conference, to which H.M. Governmentsent delegates (the chief United Kingdom delegate being thepresent Lord Justice Scott) was held at Brussels on the invitation of the Belgian Government, and a draft Internationa].Convention was drawn up and signed ad referendum by the UnitedKingdom delegates.   5. The main provisions of the Convention are contained inthe first three Articles and are as follows:-      By Article 1 ships belonging to or operated by States,cargoes belonging to them and cargoes and passengers carriedon State-owned ships, as well as the States which own such ships, so far as concerns claims in respect of the operationof such ships or in respect of the carriage of such cargoes,are to be subject to and have the benefit of the same rules of liability and the same obligations as those applicable inthe case of privately owned ships, cargoes and equipment; andby Article 2, as regards such liabilities and obligations, therales relating to the jurisdiction of the Courts, actions atlaw and procedure shall be the same as for merchant ships andcargoes belonging to private owners.      By Article 3 the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 shallnot apply to ships of war and other State-owned ships suchas hospital ships and supply ships and other vesselsbelonging to or operated by a State and employed exclusively                         -8-
at the time when the claim arises on Government and non-commercial service, and such ships shall not he subjectto seizure, arrest or detention by  any legal process nor inany proceedings in rem.   Claimants shall,  however, have theright to proceed before the appropriate Court of the state which owns or operates the ship, without that State being able to rely on its immunity, in actions in respect ofcollision or other accidents of navigation, in respect ofsalvage, in respect of general average, and in respect of repairs, necessaries or contracts relating to the ship.   6. After examination of the Convention by the various government Departments concerned, it was decided that, beforeH.M. Government could he recommended to accept the Convention,certain amendments to, and explanations of, the text were necessary.   It was further decided that these amendments andexplanations should be embodied in a draft supplementaryprotocol to be submitted to the Belgian Government with a request that that Government should endeavour to secure the assent thereto of the other governments represented at the brussels Conference before any ratifications were deposited,   7. At this stage, in February 1927, the matter was brought before the Cabinet by the then President of the Board of Tradewith a request that his colleagues should consider (i) whetherthe principle of the Convention should be accepted, and (ii)whether, if the principle were accepted, the Convention should only be ratified provided that additional safeguards were introduced into the supplementary protocol which would be satisfactory to the Law Officers of the Crown.   The cabinet agreed that the Attorney General should introduce such additional safeguards as he deemed necessary into the supplementary protocol and that, subject to this, the
                                                     2 i) 0Convention ahould be approved and the negotiations withthe Belgian Government should proceed.   8,  By October, 1927, a supplementary protocol had beendorafted in consultation with representatives of the BelgianGovernment, which was considered to be satisfactory fromthe British point of view, and on October 5th, 1927,His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels was instructed toinform the Belgian Government that H.M. Government were -prepared to accept the Convention and to ratify it subjectto the acceptance by the other signatories of the draftprotocol.   9.  On November 2nd, 1927, the Cabinet approved certain recommendations submitted by the Crown ProceedingsCommittee, including one to the effect that in the event ofthe Convention being amended to the satisfaction ofH.M.Government, it might be necessary to introduce legislation to ratify in the following year.  10.  Owing to objections to the draft protocol by the hungarian and German Governments, the acceptance of thedraft protocol was held up, and it was not until March,1932,after some revision of the text, that the German Governmentsignified, their agreement.  In April, 1932, the BelgianGovernment stated that they were approaching the other signatory governments with a view to securing their acceptance of the draft protocol.   11,  Although in March, 1934, the Belgian Ambassador ina note to the Foreign Office stated that the draft protocolhad been accepted by all the signatory governments, further delay was caused by certain questions of interpretationraised by the Netherlands Government, and it was not untilMarch, 1935, after these further difficulties had been settled, that H.M. Government were able to authoriseHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Brussels to sign the draftprotocol.                        -10-
   12.  It then became necessary to consider what,  if any,legislation must be passed by parliament beforeH.M. Government could ratify the Convention, and it waydecided to take the Opinion of the Law Officers of the Crownfor England and Scotland on this point.   15.  In the case which was submitted to the Law Officersit was pointed out that, if the obligations under theConvention could only be carried out by giving to foreignsubjects the right to take proceedings in respect ofcollision, salvage and other matters by exactly the same procedure as applied between subject and subject, the wholequestion of proceedings against the Crown would at once be opened up.  When considering the Report of the Committee of proceedings against the Crown, the Cabinet did not authorisethe introduction of the Bill which the Committee had prepared because of the dangers which it was thought would follow if statutory right were given to a subject to sue theCrown in tort.  If, therefore, in order to be in a positionto ratify the Convention it were necessary to give a statutory right to foreigners to sue the Crown in tort andin contract, it would be impossible to withhold the someright from British subjects, and this would involve a changeof policy as respects the Crown Proceedings Bill.Accordingly, in view of the practice existing in thiscountry of assuming responsibility for collision and salvageclaims made in this country against vessels owned by theCrown and in view of the procedure available by way ofPetition of Right, etc. in claims of a contractual nature.,the Law Officers were asked to advise whetherH.M. Government would, so far as these matters were concerned, be justified in ratifying the Convention without.legislation.   14.  The Law Officers have advised that -                          -11-
        (i)  as a matter of construction so long at  the     Crown is in law not liable ior the tortt  of its     servants, the obligations contained in the Convention     are not being strictly complied with,  and the  present     practice in relation to collision and Lalvage  claims     would not constitute an entire compliance with the     Convention.   Proceedings by way of Petition of Right,     etc. in claims of a contractual nature were-, however,     sufficient compliance with the Convention:  but -       (ii)  KB it would appear that claimants do in effect     get the compensation contemplated oy the Convention,     H.M. Government would, on the whole, be justified in     ratifying the Convention without legislation so far as     the claims specified in (i) are concerned.     The law Officere/added that, while in their opinionit must be realised that the Government may oe pressed tocomply fully and strictly with the terms of the convention and in that event legislation would oe necessary, it maywell be no such objection will be raised.   15,  One of the most important benefits  conferred uponBritish subjects by the Convention is the power to sue foreign states in this country.   To enable this to be done, the Law-Officers have advised that in any event legislation will beneceisary to ensure that the Courts in this country canentertain claims against foreign states, and that this legislation should ta^e the form of Bills amending theSupreme Court of Judicature ^ct and the relevant Statutesin Scotland relating to the Court of Session and SheriffCourts.   16.
