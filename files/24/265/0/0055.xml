Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy  No.CP. 335  (36).CABINET.SPAIN:  THE  BALEARIC  ISLANDS.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    1.  MY colleagues will recall that on the 19th August this year I circulatedto them a paper (F.P. (36) 10) which, after outlining the general direction whichthe  policy of Italy  might be expected to take in the  foreseeable future, clrewparticular attention to the advantages to itself which it might attempt to drawfrom the troubles in Spain.  I said that the expedients  open to Signor Mussolinifor  securing  an advantage, initially  political  but ultimately strategic, in  theWestern Mediterranean were numerous, that it was impossible at that time to foresee in what manner, at what point or by what stages the existing balance of power in the Western Mediterranean might be threatened.  It was suggested thatit would very possibly be brought about by the entry of Italy into some kind ofspecial  relationship  with one of &quot;the two contending  factions in Spain, as. a consequence of which Italy would find herself  in a position to influence in  ourdisfavour the political and military action of the future Government  of Spain orof some part of  it.   In view  of these considerations and in order  that  HisMajesty&apos;s Government might not again be reproached by the Italian Government,as has happened, with however little justification, in the Abyssinian case, for not having  declared,  sufficiently clearly or sufficiently  early,  the  objections laterdiscovered by the British Government to the action  of the Italian Government,His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Rome  informed  the  Italian Minister  forForeign Affairs on the 12th September, on my instructions,  that &quot; any alterationof the status quo  in the Western Mediterranean would  be a matter of the closestconcern to His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;  In taking  note of this communicationCount Ciano assured Mr. Ingram that  the  Italian Government, had not, either before or since  the  revolution  in Spain,  engaged in  any negotiations withGeneral Franco whereby the  status quo of the  Mediterranean would be altered,nor would they engage in any.such negotiations in the future.   This assurance was subsequently  re-affirmed spontaneously to the British Naval Attache in Romeby the Italian Ministry of Marine, and the Italian Ambassador in London has on several occasions given me similar verbal assurances.    2.  It may be that in September and October last these statements  represented the  genuine intention of the Italian Government, but there  is now the strongestindication that the development of events in Spain has placed such  temptationsin their way  that they may have forgotten,  or  chosen  to overlook, our warning.In any event, it is now clear that Signor  Mussolini is doing that very thing whichwe  feared, namely,  attempting to enter into some kind of special  relationship with the part of Spain, to wit the Balearic Islands, which he could presently turn to advantage in a number of ways.  That contingency  then having arisen whichwas contemplated in my earlier paper, it is necessary for me to ask my colleagues to consider seriously and urgently the precise nature of  the British  interests.thus placed in jeopardy and the steps which it will be  our  duty to take in orderto protect  them.       8932  [14285]                                                B
1     3.   The exact  circumstances  in which the Balearic Islands have  become a focus of danger  to British interests were, not foreseen,  indeed  were hardly foreseeable.  What  was anticipated in August was the possibility that General Franco would  make himself master of Spain  largely as a  consequence of help received from Italy, to whom he would thus in  a sense have mortgaged the policy of his country.  What, in fact, seems to have happened is that while something- like a temporary stalemate has been reached in the civil war, the inhabitants of Majorca, traditionally indifferent to the course of political events on the mainland, and distressed  and alarmed by the disturbance which this has recently introduced into their  domestic life, have become disposed to welcome, or at least to tolerate, the prospect of the protection or suzerainty of  a foreign Power which seemed to be both able and willing  to assure them of the means of return to their  normal and peaceful occupations and of protection from the menace of communism.  It is not necessary for  me here to describe in detail the events which have occurred in the Islands since the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, or  the varying fortunes of the political groups into which the inhabitants of the Islands have from time to time been divided.  It will perhaps be sufficient if I give a brief outline of the steps taken by  Signor Mussolini to establish Italian leadership in them.     4.  By the middle of November there were actually in operation in Majorca 17 new Italian aeroplanes actually in  service, and in all probability 40 or 50 Italian machines in  crates not yet assembled. To assist in the operation of these. about 50 Italians were available,  of which 22 were  pilots and  the  remainder engineers.   These all belonged to the Spanish Foreign Legion and wore the uniform of that corps.  Numerous cargoes of arms have been shipped to Majorca from Italy.  Italian engineers were  organising  the  construction  of three additional aerodromes of modern design.  In  a general  way Italy  has already expended,  and  is continuing to expend, much more money in  Majorca than would be consistent with an intention to withdraw altogether from the island after the termination of  the Spanish revolution.  Besides the aircraft numerated  above, arms and materials have continued to enter the island  to a value far in excess of anything the Majorcans could possibly hope to  repay.  Italian works in Majorca will, for many  years, continue to provide a lucrative solution for unemployment, and  the end of the  Spanish revolution, whenever and however  this occurs, will leave so much constructive work on new  defences, barracks, roads, port works and improvements of all kinds half finished, that Italy must inevitably come then to be regarded as  a welcome master or patron whose departure would be a matter of very great and serious loss to the  prosperity of the inhabitants.  It should be added that Italian is now taught as a compulsory subject in all schools in Majorca, and already the common people are beginning to make use of Italian phrases and to air with pride their knowledge of the Italian language.    5.  Some parallel for these facts can no doubt be  found on the  mainland of Spain- although the Balearic Islands are now in no military danger or need of this excessive &apos;&apos; assistance &apos;&apos; but what  is of specially sinister significance in the Islands is the  position  of an Italian  subject, Count Rossi.   Count Rossi&apos;s nominal title was, until recently, Chief of the Falange. a party which may roughly be described as the Fascists of Majorca, and in this capacity he has some 20,000 of the islanders under his direct control; but he is also the Head of the forces of Public Security (secret police) and for this purpose has some 200 Italian experts under his control who are employed in espionage, counter-espionage, administra- tion, drill,  supply, propaganda, instruction and military works.  He is known to have been sent to the island with a direct personal mission from Signor Mussolini to organise the Fascist party, but when  representations on the subject were made to Count Ciano by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome,  the former is reported &quot; to have  laughed loudly and to have said that  RossPs proceedings were soridiculous that he hoped we would pay no attention to  them.&quot;  Count Ciano was informed that in a recent speech Count Rossi  had said &quot; that Spain and Italy.are brothers.   We must possess the whole of the Mediterranean.   It is ours.&quot; Count Rossi had, moreover, on previous occasions made even more inflammatoryspeeches, of which we had to  complain in vain to Signor Grandi.  On this occasion. Count Ciano replied like the- Italian Ambassador that we  shouldattach no importance to these youthful outbursts.  He, Count Ciano, had had norelations with him whatever,  but in view of the popular feeling in Majorca itwould be very   difficult,1  if hot impossible, to  bring him back&apos; to  Italy.  The
generally accepted opinion  in  Majorca  is, however, that Count Eossi  wouldbecome the first Italian Military Governor of the island.   Since his return fromRome  on the  11th November his  title has  been  changed to &quot; Generalissimo diMajorca.&quot;     6.  It is clear, then, from the situation thus depicted that what we may haveto contemplate  is the permanent hegemony by  Italy of  the  Balearic  Islands,introduced by an ostensibly spontaneous declaration of autonomy or by some other similar political manoeuvre.   The significance of such an  event  would be bothstrategic and political.  The strategic aspect of things was considered in a reportfrom the Chiefs of Staff (1259-B of the  24th August, 1936)  written before thefull  scope of Italian operations  as described  above could  be  foreseen.  the relevant paragraph in this report is as follows :           &quot; 13. An  Italian occupation  of any of  the Balearic  Islands  would     probably  not be acceptable  to the islanders themselves, but the possibilities     of their having to submit to force majeure cannot be ruled out.         &quot; The naval facilities in these islands are at present as follows :          &quot;Majorca, 450 miles from Gibraltar, has no harbour entirely suitable     for a naval  base, since Palma and Pollenza Bay, although good in some ways,     are too exposed.  Minorca, which is still further from Gibraltar,  has in Port     Mahon a  small, but heavily defended, naval base.         &apos;&apos; As regards air  facilities, there are, so far as is known,  no  military     air stations in the Balearic Islands at the present time; but there is no doubt     that they could be established without great difficulty.   It is understood that     there is a satisfactory aerodrome site  at Pollenza,  and that civil  seaplane     services were operated at Port Mahon and Palma in 1932.         &quot; In  view of the foregoing,  an Italian occupation of any of the  Balearic     Islands would not vitally affect British strategical  interests.  At the same     time it would give Italy a base for naval and air operations, 250 miles nearer     Gibraltar than anything  which she possesses at the present time. The menace     to our control of the Straits  and to Gibraltar  itself would thus be increased.&quot;     The general conclusion  is that Italian occupation of any of the  BalearicIslands would not vitally affect British strategic interests, but this is based onthe premise that, among other things,  there were no military  air  stations in the islands.  This premise is no  longer valid, and the Chiefs of Staff may thereforewish for reconsideration of a position which may now lead them to a  differentconclusion.  This, however, is not an aspect of things which I am qualified hereto pursue.  It is rather to the political implications of  effective Italian controlof the Balearic Islands to which I must draw  attention.  The  perspective inwhich  these should be viewed is,  I  hope, in part supplied by my paper  of - the19th August,-  to which I invite  reference.  It is  not, I think,  disputed  that theBritish position in the Mediterranean and &apos;Red Sea basins is largely maintained by that  imponderable  and contentious element called  prestige,  nor that the abyssinian crisis,  discovering  as it  did the inadequacy of British  military preparations  and a widespread  reluctance in this country to employ a threat of armed  resistance to a course  on  Italy&apos;s part which was diametrically opposed tothe declared policy of England  as of other members of  the League of  Nations,shook British  prestige as nothing  else had done since the conclusion&apos; of the war.It will also probably be agreed that  the progress  of British rearmament and theevidences of  a  powerful economic revival  have  done something to repair the damage and to secure the continued  confidence and respect of  foreign Powers inthe Mediterranean and Red Sea basins in regard, first, to the general characterof British foreign policy,  and, secondly, to  the determination of the  UnitedKingdom Government to protect  its own interests  wherever. these were called in question.   But  I do not like to contemplate how grave would be the risk toour position in  the Mediterranean  if Italy were permitted  with impunity tomake another  move such as the  establishment of  Italian control in the BalearicIslands which would universally be recognised as a fresh and very importantstep  towards  a further propagation  of  her own constitutional theories and towards  increased freedom  of her  military  action in  the Mediterranean.Nothing that  we could  say  in  explanation or justification of.passivity &quot;or ofmerely ineffectual  remonstrance  would&apos;be credited.   I doubt  whether we couldconvince: ourselves, I am certain that we could hot convince others, that we had       [14285]                                                    B  2
1not from anxiety or timidity, or from a sense of our own weakness, been obligedto acquiesce in an Italian move which was, if not in immediate, at any rate indefinite ulterior conflict with a vital British interest.   I use the word &quot;vital &quot;advisedly, for to permit,  except under the sternest compulsion, the impairmentof a  vital interest would be for His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  to  abdicate  the responsibilities of a Great Power.  If we were to allow the suggestion that  our action was of this character to reach all  those listening ears on the coasts ofthe Mediterranean and Red Seas  which have been assiduously  taught by manyagencies to expect premonitory crackings in the structure of  the British Common-wealth  of Nations and  in the  Colonial  Empire,  no  man  can foresee whatdisastrous modifications  might not  take  place  in the status  of  an  Empiredepending for its paramountcy not only upon armed strength, but upon opinions,nor what  unexampled efforts in arms might not be exacted from us before  theposition could  be re-established.   These are grave words,  too grave it may bethought to be applicable  to what are,  after  all,  speculative  propositions;  butto underestimate these might well be fatal.    7.  Consideration of  the courses open to us to meet the risks which I havesummarily described reveals a simple but alarming prospect.  I  exclude the idea that we should publicly  remonstrate with the Italian  Government, unless  weare prepared in the last resort for armed resistance to Italian designs.  Nothing-could be more futile or more provocative than public remonstrances which proveineffectual.  On the other hand,  once the  decision were taken  that  to  preventItalian domination of the Balearic Islands was a vital political interest  forwhich the United Kingdom Government would fight, the way would be opened .to many expedients, of which some would in  my view  suffice to restrain italy from  pursuing her plans  in Majorca to a conclusion or  from taking  hostilitiesagainst this country.   But all of  these  expedients would involve two essentialthings,  one would  be  a demonstration of adequate military strength and  theother would be a declaration in a wholly unambiguous form of the circumstances in which, and purposes for which, we were prepared to use that military strength.I need not at this stage develop these clearly indispensable pre-requisites; andI therefore turn briefly to the general considerations in the light of which  thedecision we may have to  take one way or the other to resist or to acquiesce must be made.    8.  The first of these is the position of France.   The French interest is clearlysafety of  her  African communications which is complementary to freedom of transit of British ships through the Mediterranean.   There can hardly be anyquestion that  but a few short years ago the French would have joined whole-heartedly  in combined resistance to Italy with ourselves based on  a preponderance of force which neither Italy nor Germany nor both together  would be at all likelyto have challenged.  The  progressive decrease in the relative military,  naval andair strength  of France, combined with the deterioration  in the cohesion andresolution of the French people themselves and the mounting ambition and self-confidence of Germany and Italy,  alter this picture.  On the other hand, as therecent instructions sent by the French Government to their Ambassador at Romeshow  (see  Annex), they appear now to be fully alive to the dangers of a situationwhich is primarily, though not exclusively, a French interest.    9.  The second general consideration relates, of course, to the use to which theGerman Government might turn a war in which England and France were engagedagainst Italy.   While the intentions of the German  Government  are,  in  any given circumstances, very difficult  to predict, prediction in  this case is renderedall the more difficult  by the fact that it is as yet  impossible to postulate for acertainty  the  attitude of France.  What  can be said with some  confidence isthat Germany would  not  enter a war of the kind contemplated for the sake ofrescuing Italy, and that,  if she had recourse to arms for any purpose, it  would more  likely be for that of capturing and consolidating what in the developmentof  power on  the  continent of  Europe  must be   regarded  as  her( firstobjectives,  viz.,  for s the  purpose  of  ensuring   predominance   and  freeaccess  to  supply  of  all kinds  on   her   Eastern  and Southern  borders.This  prospect  in itself is sufficiently alarming,  but  the possibility  cannot be excluded that,  in accordance with the teachings  of a  certain school of militarystrategy, she would employ the occasion to attack the strongest rather than the
weakest section of the &quot;enemy front&quot;; attack, that is,  towards the Westernrather than towards the South or the East.  Moreover. Germany&apos;s relations with italy are now very close and a large measure of Italo-German collaboration hasundeniably been achieved of late.  It might well be that the two dictators would stand together on this point also.   The arguments which could be used in supportof either the first or the second of these alternative suppositions, or in support ofthe view that Germany would prefer to go on building up her own  strength whiledog ate dog, are much too extensive to set out at length in this  paper.  I onlymention them here in order to stress the fact that they fall inevitably  to beconsidered  before a wise decision can be reached on the  question of how far weshould assert ourselves in the  Mediterranean and in order to record my ownrather tentative conclusion that the probability of a considerable accession of strength to Germany resulting from war in which Great Britain and France were engaged  against Italy is  not unequally  balanced  by the probability that therelations with  Germany could,  for the future, be conducted with  very  muchgreater advantage to ourselves if we had  demonstrated beyond all possibility of doubt  that  in  the  Mediterranean  there  is a point  beyond which  the UnitedKingdom cannot be driven  by sapping and mining or by blusters and  threats, andthat where a vital  interest is  threatened, the English will be found, for all wespeak so often and so smoothly of compromise  and conciliation, not to be at hearta meek nor in  action  a timid people  at  all.   On the other hand, it would ofcourse be  folly to  contemplate  the possibility of war with Italy without  alsohaving taken into account the possibility of  Germany assisting  her.     10.  The problem is therefore  a grave and far-reaching one,  and I shall beglad if my colleagues will give to it their earnest and early consideration.     11.  In view of the nature of the French representations in Rome, I considerthat as a first step,  while thanking the French Government for their communica-tion, we should ask them  to keep us  informed of  any reply they may receive.It is for consideration whether  we  should go further than this  and  give the many indication of our attitude in regard to any further steps they may contemplate.     12.  As my colleagues are aware, His Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador at Rome hasrecently had his first conversation  with the Italian  Minister for Foreign affairs with a view to an eventual  exchange of assurances regarding British and Italianinterests in the Mediterranean.  I see  no reason why these conversations shouldbe delayed, owing to the present development in the Belearic Islands.  On thecontrary they  will  constitute a useful test  of  Italian bona fides, since  thedraft of the mutual assurances Avhich Sir E. Drummond is to be instructed tosubmit to Count Ciano  will express the wish of both Governments to see maintainedthe territorial status quo in the Mediterranean.                                                                    A.  E.December 14. 1936.
ANNEX.         Communicated by the French Embassy on December 12, 1936.(Translation.)     In the  course of the recent discussion in the French  Chamber on foreignpolicy M. Delbos spoke as follows :          &quot; We are considering and shall continue to consider with vigilance the     the  defence of  our  incontestable, rights  and of our  permanent and vital     interests in the Western Mediterranean, in Morocco, and  in the strategic     positions in the Ocean which dominate no  less our lines of communication     with Africa.  Determined for our part to respect the status quo, we are no     less determined  to see that others do likewise, de facto as well as de pcre.&quot;     The French Charge d&apos;Affaires in Rome has been instructed, while makinghis demarche in the  most friendly way possible, to explain to Count Ciano thatif M. Delbos had refrained from alluding more  precisely to a collection of facts which was, however, receiving his full attention, he was none the less concerned at the information which was  reaching him on the situation  in the BalearicIslands.     The activities of certain Italian agents unfortunately give the impression that these persons are anxious to exploit the  Spanish affair for the purpose of ensuring Italian de facto control over the archipelago.     The establishment of any foreign authority over a position which dominatesFrance&apos;s lines of communication with North  Africa would affect French vital interests and create a situation which no French Government could  regard withindifference.     The French  Government therefore  hoped most  sincerely that the ItalianGovernment would see in the non-intervention undertakings sufficient guarantee for curbing spontaneous actions on  the  part of  agents  in the Balearic Islandswhich run  the  risk  of  seriously damaging  the cordiality  of Franco-italian relations.
