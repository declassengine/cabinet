CONFIDENTLY -                                                 A.C. 362.BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OP TRADE - SEPTEMBER,  1936.  Summary of reports submitted by members of theBoard of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented insome cases with statistical information fromother sources).     OVERSEAS TRADE.   Imports in September at  71.9 m.  were 11.1 m. more than in September, 1935.   Nearly 70$ of the risewas in food and raw materials.   Of the increase of  3,6 m, inmanufactured goods,  603,000 related to non-ferrous metalproducts,  513,000 to machinery and  424,000 to iron and steel products.   Exports of United Kingdom products,  37 m., were 2.9 m. more and re-exports,   3.9 m., were slightly more thanin September, 1935,     EMPLOYMENT,  The total number of unemployed persons onthe registers at 21st September, 1,624,339, was 10,399 morethan at 24th August.    The main variations were:-   London......   -     138       North Western.  4     226   South Eastern   +   6,449       Northern......  -   1,199   South Western   *   4,133       Scotland......  +   6,624   Midlands ....   -   7,445       Wales........  +   3,069   North Eastern   -   1,320     The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment (excluding agricultural workers) was 10,966,000,5,000 more than at 24th August and 488,000 more than at23rd September, 1935.     Employment improved in the woollen and worsted, pottery,iron and steel, engineering, shipbuilding, motor vehicle, metal goods, and boot and shoe industries the dressmaking andmillinery trades, furniture making, and the dock and harbourservices.   There was a seasonal decline in employment in the hotel and boarding-house service, the distributive and certain                             -1-
food preparation trades, and the fishing and buildingindustries, while the numbers temporarily stopped increased in the coal-mining industry.    RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  In the four weeks ended 27th Septemberrailway traffic receipts increased by  530,000 (4.81$)compared with the corresponding period of 1935.    passenger traffic increased by 5.92%, merchandise, minerals and livestock by 5.14% and coal, coke and patent fuel by 1.49$.    SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.   Homeward freight marketswere better than in any previous month this year.  Demandfor tramp tonnage expanded.  The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 = 100) was 103.76 as against 93.85in August and 80.13 a year ago.   At the 1st October 403,000net tons of shipping were laid up in Great Britain andIreland as compared with 502,000 at the 1st July and512,000 a year ago.    The amount of tonnage under construction in Great Britainand Ireland at the 30th September was 929,000 tons gross(the highest quarterly total for six years) as against849,000 at the 30th June and 531,000 a year ago.    BANKING.  Money continued plentiful during the greaterpart of September but became very tight temporarily at&apos;the end of the month.   Events  abroad had little effect  onthe money market.   The average  Treasury Bill rate  declined from 10/9.49d to 10/3.52d.   The franc weakened (the spotrate to 77-jg and the forward to 7f discount) until it wasdevalued on 25th September;  this was followed by the devaluation of the Swiss franc  and the guilder.   The dollar,
                                                    3under the influence of the franc, declined from 5.0316 to5.07^ but recovered sharply to around 4,94 after the collapse of the gold bloc.  The price of gold fellsteadily from 138/5d.  to 137/2-g-d but rose sharply to140/9d on the devaluation of trie franc.   Gold imports into the United Kingdom exceeded exports by nearly  30 m.The silver market was very dull.    FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.  Devaluation of severalEuropean currencies was the chief event of the month.^n France,  upper and lower devaluation limits (34?fc and25% respectively) have been fixed;  the authorities appearto be operating on the dollar-franc exchange to maintainabout 30% depreciation.   Switzerland followed the Frenchmethod but in effect the exchange is being controlled by official dealings in gold.   The Netherlands exchangeis entirely free, with an Exchange Fund raised by short-term Treasury borrowing;   the Government envisages an eventual devaluation of 15 to 20% but commercial andfinancial opinion favours 25$.   In Italy, the lira hadbeen devalued by over 40% but exchange restrictionscontinue;  the exchange situation, already strained, islikely soon to be adversely affected by large imports of grain.   In Czechoslovakia further devaluation (by 16$)is having considerable influence on Austria wheredevaluation may have to be adopted.   Latvia, Turkey and greece have joined the sterling bloc.    COAL.  The average weekly output of coal duringthe 13 weeks ended 26th September was 4.19 m. tons ascompared with 4.04 m.  tors in the corresponding perioda year ago - an increase of 4$.   The average number of wage-earners employed was slightly less than a year                     -3-
before.   Exports in September amounted to 3.03 m. tons as compared with 2.93 m. tons in September, 1935.  Thechief increases were to Finland, France, Denmark andAlgeria.   There were no exports to Italy, as comparedwith 158,000 tons a year ago;  and countries taking lessincluded Canada and Spain.    IRON AND STEEL.  The industry generally workedalmost to capacity.   Producers were disinclined to seekfresh business and the placing of orders for early executionbecame more difficult.   Pig-iron output (651,000 tons)was 22.9% greater than in September, 1935;  producersintroduced rationing of supplies, but consumers&apos;  immediate requirements were being met.   The semi-finished and finished steel departments were extremely active.  Crudesteel production (1,027,000 tons) was 20$ more than ayear ago.    The volume of overseas enquiry was good, but,owing to the strength of home demand, the surplus forexport was small.    Scotland.  Demand continued to increase generally,but export business was on a small scale.    North-East Coast.  A system of rationing suppliesof foundry iron has been adopted;  fresh furnaces willbe put into operation before the end of the year.  Theplate market continued very strong and another millwill shortly go into operation.  Sheet-works were better employed but need more overseas business.    Sheffield.  Makers of tool-steels were particularlyactive.  Rolling-mills working on hire  for  steelmakersreported record operations,    South-Wales. The tinplate market has improved, due partly to  increased overseas demand and works were operating at nearly 66$ of capacity.  The export market for galvanised sheets improved.                   -4-
   ENGINEERING.   The state of order hooks,  as regards bothcurrent and prospective business,  continued satisfactory.Re-armament and other urgent contracts are  necessitatingimports of machinery at a much higher level than a year ago.Exports of machinery were valued at  3.38 m. as compared-with  3.14 rn. in September, 1935.   MOTOR INDUSTRY.   The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered in August was 21,163 - 2,180 less than a yearago;  there was a decrease of 2,955 in private cars, butan increase of 504 in goods vehicles.   The production ofprivate cars in July was 29,796 as against  25,784 in July,1935, and the production of commercial vehicles increased from 7,923 to 10,044.   Exports of new private cars andchassis in September amounted to 4,801 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,498 - 21fi and 17/ respectivelymore than in September, 1935.    169 complete new private cars and taxis were imported as compared with 290 a yearago.   LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.  Activity was maintained or increased in most light metal trades.   Difficulties inobtaining sufficient skilled labour are becoming increasingly serious.   practically all non-ferrous metalplants are working to capacity.   In many sections of  thetool trades demand was exceedingly heavy;  works are beingextended.   In the lock and allied trades,  export salesincreased.   The cutlery, electro-plate and sterling silvertrades improved considerably.   ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.  Activity declined early in themonth but improved later and prospects remain favourable.The index of heavy engineering orders (on both home and export account) was much higher than in September, 1935.Consumption of electricity amounted to 1,544 m. units  -16.9/ more than a year ago.                         -5-
   COTTON.  The expansion in activity which normallyoccurs in early Autumn &quot;began to he felt late in September,&quot;but uncertainty over the sterling-dollar exchange tended to restrict lousiness.   The devaluation of the gold bloccurrencies is not expected to have serious immediate effect on the industry.     Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinnerswere 20.6 m, lbs. in September against 23.6 m. lbs. inAugust and 20.8 m. lbs. in September, 1935.  Thefdeclineas compared with August was confined to the beginning ofthe month and deliveries reached a high level at the endof September.   American and Indian raw cotton pricesrose:   Egyptian prices fell.  Yarn exports at 11,8 m. &apos;lbs. were slightly more than in August and 1.7 m. lbs.more than in September, 1935.   Exports of piece-goods at154 m. sq. yds, were 5 m. sq. yds. less than in Augustbut 3.5 m. sq. yds. more than in September, 1935;countries taking less than in August included India(3 m. sq. yds. less), Canada, Colombia and Argentina, butthere were substantial increases to Denmark and british west Africa.   WOOL.  There was an appreciable increase in generalactivity.   Exports of tops and yarns increased ascompared with August but exports of tissues fell.  Rawwool prices remained steady;  they were on the average17% above those ruling a year ago.     The woollen section was fairly well employed butactivity in the worsted section, particularly the weavingbranch, was less satisfactory.  As regards new business,enquiries related more to woollen than to worsted goods.   SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.  Demand for rayon yarns wasnot brisk but the general tone is considered satisfactor?/..Business in staple fibre remained quiet.  Demand for rayon                          -6-
fabrics was dull, but an optimistic view is taken of thecoming print season.   Exports of rayon yarns and piecegoods showed increases as compared with September 1955,In the silk trade, quotations by French manufacturers wereawaited with interest in view of the devaluation of the franc.   HIDES AND LEATHER.  Daring September the hide market was very active and prices generally advanced;  on the devaluation of the gold bloc currencies markets becamesubdued.   The recession in leather business which oftenprecedes the Trade Fair was much less marked than inrecent years, demand for sole leather continuing fairlyactive,   PAPER. The usual seasonal increase of activity was fully in evidence.   Generally speaking, the volume  ofbusiness showed a marked advance on that of the previoustwo months and was slightly greater than in September,1935.-   Exports were substantially more than a year ago,mainly because Australia made up the leeway in hertakings this year of newsprint.   CHEMICALS.   Home and export sales of alkalies and sales of chlorine products increased as compared with august,   Sales of industrial nitrogen products were well maintained at home and, with certain exceptions abroad,The increase in home sales of dyestuffs was maintained,but exports were rather lower.   Home sales of sulphate of ammonia are higher this season than last, but exports have declined considerably due to the cessation of sales to Spain.   POTTERY.   The earthenware section was quieter than usual in August,   Demand was normal in the chinasection and prospects for the Christmas trade are good.In the glazed wall and hearth tiles section all works were
producing to capacity following the imposition of increased duties on imports.   Sales of sanitary ware ofearthenware and of fireclay decreased as compared with august, 1955.   Demand for electrical-ware was satisfactory..   BUILDING.  Conditions remained satisfactory.   Thesecond quarter of 1956 was the &quot;busiest on record.   RETAIL TRADE. The money value of retail sales inAugust was 7.4$ greater than in  August, 1935.    sales of food and perishables rose by 3.8$, and of othermerchandise by 5.7$.   Preliminary returns for september indicate results less favourable than in previousrecent months.   CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND).  The drapery trade hasbeen very busy (especially in the fashion Departments)and trade in the furniture etc section continued very good.   CANADIAN TRADE.  Economic conditions improved further in August and production expanded.   The rise  inwholesale prices continued.   Zinc exports were a post-war record.   Compared with the previous month exportsof copper increased substantially but nickel and asbestosexports declined.   Newsprint production fell  slightly.Lumber output was a record for August.  Imports ofbauxite and crude rubber increased considerably.  Thewheat  crop, according to the first official estimate, issmaller than last year&apos;s but the quality is much higher.   AUSTRALIAN TRADE.   The manufacture in Australia  ofwoollen goods for home consumption is steadily increasing.370,735 bales of  wool were received into store from the1st July to the 31st August, as compared with 435,786 ayear  before, the quantity sold or shipped being 11,443and 6,920 respectively.   Wheat and flour shipments  from 1st December to 29th September were equivalent to 83.8 m.                         -8-
bushels of wheat as against 85.1 m. bushels a year ago.Imports of merchandise during August amounted to  9,25 m.(Australian  currency) as compared with  8,96 m. a year before.   The surplus of exports over imports (includingbullion and  coin) for the year ended 30th June, 1936,was  22.5 m. sterling as compared with  16 in. sterling for1934/35.   SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.   Imports in July were 13.9%greater than in July, 1935.   Exports (excluding gold)were 15.4% more, due largely to increased shipments ofv/ool and diamonds and despite a heavy fall in sugarexports.   The favourable trade balance for the firstseven months of 1936 is  20.3 m. as compared with  14.5 m.a year ago.   Both output and exports of gold were greaterthan a year  ago.   The value of building plans passed rose&apos;sharply to a new record level.   INDIAN TRADE.  Imports in September were 9,50 lakhs ofrupees as compared with 10,21 lakhs in September, 1935, and exports of 15,18 lakhs as compared with 12,02 lakhs.Rainfall was almost general and crops are reported to bein good condition, except in the United Provinces and the punjab where damage has been done by floods.   The revised estimate of  the area covered by the 1936-37 cotton crop is % less than the corresponding estimate for 1935-6.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.----------   Argentina,  in September national revenue andexpenditure  continued to expand, exports increased and imports decreased in value as compared with 1935, theexchange value of the peso improved and a general feeling of optimism  prevailed.   Total grain shipments were at ahigh level.   Excellent general rains fell, renderingoutlook for  the new wheat and linseed crops very satis-factory, but the critical time is not yet past.   Thev/ool market  was active and firm, exceptionally high pricesbeing realised for new crop merino wool.  Livestockprices were  depressed.
   Brazil.  Exports in the first seven months this year were 14$ and imports 15$ in value more than a year beforeThe Sao Paulo cotton crop for the season up to 31st Auguswas 80$ larger and of better quality than a year agoiThe note circulation increased in August and prices wererising.   Chile.  Imports of merchandise from the United kingdom during January - July were slightly more than a year before while imports from Germany were doubled.   Theforeign exchange situation continued very difficult.Increases in Customs duties are contemplated with a viewto balancing the Budget.    Uruguay. A general feeling of prosperity is reported;-The peso appreciated further.   There was no scarcity ofexchange for current transactions.   The hide market wasactive.   Wheat and linseed crops were in good condition.   Colombia. Coffee exports during January - July were slightly more in volume than a year before.   Ecuador.  An. exchange control organisation is being set up and some exchange has been issued in payment for imports of necessities.   Venezuela.  Demand for cocoa and new crop coffee was good.   The foreign exchange available was insufficientfor1 requirements.
