COPY NO.   c.p..  558 (36).                        CABINET.              DATE 0? AND  ARRANGEMENTS EOR THE CORONATION.               Note by the lordJPresident of  the Council.               My colleagues  may wish to know that  I had an Audience      of His  Majesty,  immediately  after the Accession  Council,  on      Saturday,  13th December,  and made a recommendation to him,  in      accordance with the  decision of the Cabinet,  that no alteration      should  be made in the date of the Coronation.    The King  agreed      that  the date already announced, Wednesday, 12th May, 1937,      should  stand.                                                r               I also raised with  His Majesty the question of the      reconstitution of the Coronation Committee of the Privy Council,      and reminded him that it  would also be  necessary to set up  the      Coronation Commission.    The King expressed his  wish that      these bodies should  be reconstituted ps soon  as  possible, and      that  no changes in personnel should take  place  other than      those necessitated by the fact that he  himself would no longer      be a member.               The King also expressed to me  very tentatively and      privately the possibility that he might not be able to      undertake quite such a heavy Coronation Programme as that to      which King Edward had agreed;  for instance,  the length of  the      route might now have to be reconsidered from  the point of      view of his own ability to stand the strain.  I  am asking the      Earl  Marshal to request an Audience at  a very early date  with      a view  to ascertaining the King&apos;s wishes on these points.                                   (Int&apos;d) J. R. M.Privy Council Office.l4th December,  1936.
