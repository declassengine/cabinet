Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of                               Defence;               The Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of         State for Scotland, the Minister of Labour and  the First         Commissioner of Works discussed this question with me  on .         the 11th November.   Before the discussion the  Secretary         of State for War had circulated a memorandum on four         points -               (1) The need for the cordite factory;               (2) The water supply.               (3) The number of persons likely to be employed                       at the factory when erected.              . (4) The rate of erection.               The Minister of Labour, who had already seen the  War         Office memorandum, furnished a memorandum dealing with  the         labour question, both in connection with the erection  and         with the operation of the factory.               The Secretary of State for Scotland in his memorandum         dealt with the water supply and the necessity of legislation         in connection&apos; with the abstraction of water from the River         Esk at Gretna.               It was agreed that I should summarise the arguments         contained in these three memoranda with a view  to decision         at the next meeting of the Cabinet on Friday, 13th         November,  if possible.                        -  -  &apos;        &apos;  1.&apos;.       .
      The case for the erection of a cordite factory isin ray opinion abundantly made out.   Waltham and Ardeer(1.0.1. ) will, after extensions at Ardeer,   have a maximumoutput of 540 tons per week available for the ^rmy and AirForce.    The Navy&apos;s supplies come from Holton Heath.The Cabinet on 31st July, 1935, accepted the position that Waltham cannot be  relied on in war time.   Ardeeralone is not sufficient for the minimum regular Army andAir Force requirements, nor is there any alternative toHolton Heath for the Navy,   It is considered by the WarOffice most undesirable to rely solely on the trade supply from Ardeer if only from the point of view of price controland supervision.    The size of the proposed factory to be erected either at Bishopton or at Gretna has been consider-toby the Treasury Inter-Service Committee,      The Gretna site has very great technical advantages.There are roads on the site, levelled tracks for railways,certain foundations and buildings which can be used,magazine mounds,  etc.     Assuming building labour can beobtained a factory at Gretna, it is estimated, can be erected six to eight months sooner than a factory atBishopton.    The estimate of the First Commissioner ofWorks is that the factory will take 2-g- to 3 years to erect, assuming a regular and sufficient supply of building-labour.    There is an ample supply of suitable water whichcould be taken from the River Esk by pumping.   The costof erecting a factory at Gretna is estimated at  201,000.The annual cost of obtaining water at Gretna, on a basisof an output of cordite of 500 tons a week, is  1,300,At Gretna village there are a considerable number of houses which would be, to some extent, available for housingemployees at the factory.   The main road to Carlisle andtransport arrangements both by road and rail are extensive.
      The disadvantages of Gretna are the difficulty ofobtaining labour in sufficient quantity (well  under1,000 in peace time,  up to 18,000 in war time).    I  am satisfied that housing would have to be provided  for a portion of the employees even in peace time.     It isproposed, for the purpose of starting the factory, totransfer 300 men from Waltham straight away.    If theRiver Esk is to be drawn upon to the extent  proposed,even in peace time, the Lord Advocate is of  opinion that legislation with compensation for the fishing  rights would be required.    Wo estimate of this compensationcould, of course, be given, but I do not attach any importance to this suggested objection if the  Governmentchoose Gretna.    I have no doubt the necessary legislationcan be passed long before the erection of the  factory is complete.    The great objection, however, to  Gretna isthe difficulty of obtaining building labour  at thepresent time.    4,000 men, of whom one-third  will beskilled men, would be required.     On the information furnished to me I am satisfied that the chances of ob-taining this amount of building labour are doubtful.The six to eight months&apos; advantage in speed  of erection of a factory at Gretna would, I think, be found to dis-appear in consequence of this difficulty.      The case for Bishopton is broadly speaking that itis in a largely populated district (five miles fromClydebank, four miles from Paisley, twelve miles fromthe centre of Glasgow) and that at the present momentthere are some 100,000 men and women registered asunemployed in the district.   This figure compares witha figure for the Gretna district of 2,950 insured menunemployed.     So far as building labour is  concerned,I was informed that on the 26th October there  were
10,400 men unemployed in the building and public workscontracting industries in the Bishopton area as  comparedwith 570 in the Gretna area including Carlisle,  Longtown andAnnan.      The main objection to Bishopton, apart from thequestion of speed of erection, is the difficulty of gettingwater.    This would have to be brought by a pipeline fifteenmiles long from a Glasgow Corporation reservoir, the costof which is estimated at  383,000.     The capital cost  oferection at Bishopton is  174,000 more than Gretna.  Theannual cost of water (not including the interest on capital) is  3,500 as compared with  1,300 for Gretna.      r      The best judgment I can form is that, having regardto the difficulty of getting building labour at Gretnaand the necessity which would arise for a large housing scheme in the event of expansion under war conditions,Bishopton should be chosen.   I have not mentioned thepolitical advantage of placing this factory in adepressed area.    The Minister of Labour, however,strongly presses the importance of this consideration atthe present time.    My opinion of this is that althoughit would no doubt be satisfactory to be able to point tothis additional prospect of work for a depressed area,the area in question has not done badly, having regard  to -      (l) The new &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.      (2) The prospect of another battleship in the             same yard.      (3) The amount of Mercantile tonnage now building             on the Clyde.      (3) The extension of factories at Irvine and             Ardeer.      (4) The proposal to erect an ammonia plant             in Lanarkshire.
      On the whole, although I was at first greatly impressed with the technical advantages of the Gretnasite, I think the preference ought to he given toBishopton, subject to considerations of the probableadditional outlay required at Bishopton, as to which Iam not competent to express any opinion.
