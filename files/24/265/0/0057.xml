SECRET.                                                        Corr No.CP.  337  (36)47THE CABINETTHE  ROLE  OF  THE  BRITISH  army memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR WAR     1. The Chancellor  of  the Exchequer in his memorandum* of 11th December    20questions my statement that I am asking for reaffirmation of a previous decision.      General     2. The principle to which I submit that assent has been given by the Cabinet is   5572that the Field Force should  consist of 17 Divisions 4 Regular Divisions and 1 MobileDivision (Regular)  and 12 Territorial.  It was suggested last year that this army should be sent to the seat of  war in four contingents, the last arriving some  eight months after the outbreak of hostilities.  Assent was given to the equipment of  the     rfirst five divisions immediately.   The question of the equipment of the remainder was postponed.     3. As  I have explained in my memorandum^ of  3rd December, the reason why Iagreed to this postponement was that it then seemed  that little or nothing could  bedone with  regard to the equipment of  the 12 Territorial Divisions  until that  of  the5 Regular Divisions had been completed.  It now appears that  not only can bothoperations  proceed simultaneously though in a  very  modified  form  so far  as  theTerritorial Army is concerned but  also that the lack of a decision with regard  to  the equipment  of the Territorial Army  is  definitely  delaying the equipment of  theRegular Army.     4. The Chancellor - asks whether I  am now proposing that  the  whole  of  theTerritorial  Army should  be ready at zero hour.   To  which I would reply that if wehave an Army the more ready it is for war the better, and that, apart from questionsof finance,  it would obviously be desirable that the whole  of the Territorial  army should be as ready for active service  as possible.     5. Further enquiry and experience has  shown  that the policy of holding fourselected divisions  in a  greater state  of preparedness than the remainder is undesirable for many reasons, and it is now the view of the General Staff that equipment shouldbe issued to the whole  Territorial  Army without preference  but  keeping  in  view the necessity of. transferring a proportion  of such equipment to the first contingent as might be necessary in order to complete its  establishment when the  emergency arises.The Chancellor of the Exchequer can rest assured that  if this  policy were adopted itwould not, in fact, involve  larger expenditure during  the next three  years  than ifauthority were given to equip the first  Territorial Army contingent to an extent thatwould render them prepared to take the  field two  months after the opening ofhostilities.     6. With regard to paragraph 3 of the Chancellors memorandum,* nobody can hopeaccurately to predict the conditions of the  next war, but I would say that the simplestand the gravest emergency which can be envisaged is an attack by Germany on Franceand Belgium.  It has  been the view of successive Chiefs of Staff and Secretaries ofState for War that in that  eventuality  we should he prepared to send a land force to belgium or  France.   It  may be assumed with some certainty that, rapidly as  eventsmoved in August, 1914, they will move a great deal more rapidly on the next occasion,and therefore the further our preparations are advanced the better.     7. The presence of four Biutish divisions in Flanders  in August,  1914 apartfrom the psychological  and political aspect had  what may have been a determiningeffect on the history of  the  war, hut owing to the lack of reinforcements at the end ofOctober in that year the war on the western front was very nearly lost.* CP. 334 (36).t CP. 326 (36).Thia document  is the property of His Britannic Majesty1!? Government.                Printed for the Cabinet, December, 193(5
     8.  If the view were now taken that  we should in no circumstances send a  landforce to take part  in a Continental war and that such a possibility no  longer existed,the whole of our military policy would, of course, require immediate  and fundamentalreadjustment.  That policy has throughout this  century been based on the assumptionthat such a possibility  does exist and obviously military  plans  must  envisage the worst possibility that can arise.  I can hardly believe that the Cabinet will be preparedto banish such a possibility from their minds, and if they are not prepared to dismisssuch a  possibility they must prepare  to face it.   The Chancellor  suggests  that allpossible alternatives should be surveyed  by the competent authorities, but I  think  Ican assure him that the competent authorities would not be willing  to dismiss theparticular contingency to which  I have referred,  and so long as  that one remains allother alternatives have little significance.     9. It is, of course,  true that we have a  Navy and an Air Force  and that it wouldbe foolish to assume that our resources are without limits but it is also true that theother nations concerned have Navies and Air  Forces, as well as  Armies,  in accordancewith what they believe  to be their needs, and that they all employ 100 per cent, oftheir man-power in their fighting services and that their financial resources are inferiorto ours.     10.  I  am  not at  present asking for  any  increase  in  the extraordinarily lowdemands made on the man-power of the nation, which are lower than  those made onthe man-power of any other nation in Europe.   I am only asking for  recognition ofthe principle that the Army  as it exists  should  be prepared  for  war.  The manyreasons  in  favour of  such  a  course are  set  forth in  my previous  paper.   If theemergency envisaged should never arise, no great or irremediable harm will  have beendone.  If  the  international  situation improves  we  shall  not have  incurred any permanent commitment as suggested in paragraph 8 of the Chancellors memorandum^We  can  rapidly all  too rapidly, as  we have learnt reduce establishments to meetmore reassuring conditions.  But on the  other hand, if the worst does happen, we shall certainly not regret any money that has been spent in preparing  our defences.                                                                          D.  C.  THE WAR OFFICE,       14th  December, 1936.      * CP. 334 (36).(1536/8)&quot;&apos; 70 12/36 W.O.P. 142
