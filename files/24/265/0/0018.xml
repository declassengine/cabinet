(THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY&apos; OP HIS BRITANNIC             MAJESTY1 3  GOVERNMENT) -GOBY no cp. S9$/36.                   CABINET                       INDIA            Appreciation of the Political Situation,  by  the Government of India,  dated 27th October,  1936.            Circulated far  the information of the Cabinet  by the Secretary of State for India.
       Confidential appreciation of the       Political Situation in India, dated       the 27th October 1936,  issued on       the authority  of the  Secretary  of  State        _for  Inaia._1.     Crop prospects are generally satisfactory,  exceptin parts of the Bombay Presidency, where, however,  therecent rains have considerably eased the situation.Scarcity has been declared only in the Ahmednagar District,where a grant of Rs.158,750 has been sanctioned for various measures of relief.  In Bihar some damage has been causedby floods in Patna and Gaya where relief operations  are inprogress.  Both here and in the affected parts  of the bombay Presidency the situation is to some extent being exploited for electioneering purposes by CongressCommittees, which are distributing gratuitous relief and making appeals for funds.  The Ahmedabad and Gujarat floodrelief funds have between them sanctioned 75,000 rupeesfor such purposes.2.     Both houses of the Central Legislature were in session during the month.  The outstanding event was theViceroy&apos;s first address to the two houses which containedimportant references to political and constitutional questions.  The Congress Party in the Assembly maintained theirtradition of absenting themselves during the address ratheragainst the wishes of some of their members, end they have incurred some outspoken criticism in the press for theirdiscourteous and unnecessary gesture.   His Excellency&apos;sspeech attracted widespread notice in the press, moreespecially as it was his first public utterance on constitutional subjects,  while the Nationalist press couldnot accept his picture of the opportunities offered by thenew constitution, a deep impression was evidently created byhis expression of readiness to work in future with any and
 every political party willing to work the constitution, and several Nationalist papers paid tributes to the evidence of the sincerity of his assurance, one even stating that it might be expected to evoke a widespread response.   Most of the time of the Assembly was occupied in the discussion&apos;of the Indian Companies Bill - an important measure which was eventually passed.       The business of the House was, howeveh,  considerably interrupted by obstruction- in the form of numerous adjournment motions on comparatively trivial subjects, and the waste of public time by abuse of this privilege         r- eventually resulted in two adjournment motions  to protest against it.  Amongst other items, Doctor Khan Sahib&apos;s resolution calling on the Government to take immediate steps to secure that public servants should not interfere in the ensuing election attracted much interest.  The  debate revealed very little substance in the complaints of such interference, but gave the Government an opportunity, first, of emphasising their adherence to the Public Servants&apos;&apos; Conduct Rules on this subject and, secondly, of uttering a warning that the Government cannot tolerate illegal or seditious activities merely because these are carried on under cover of an electioneering campaign/ and that neither the Government nor its officers could let the campaign degenerate into the disseminating of sedition among the masses or other forms of intimidation. 3.     The election campaign is now fairly general and with the dispersal of members of the Central Legislature, will soon be in full swing.  Parties other than Congress still show a conspicuous lack of organisation and local rivalries and differences prevent any effective combination amongst the
numerous small groups.  The financial resources of Congresshave now been brought into pla5r and. there is reason tobelieve that Congress will not be in want of funds for theelection.  With all -chose advantages, however, the congress party themselves are not without difficulties.  The oppositionto the communal award in Bengal and Punjab which cannot be reconciled with the Congress manifesto, has produced some-thing like a party crisis in Bengal and has seriously upsetPandit Jawahar Lai Nehru&apos;s plan of a united front in thatPresidency.  Elsewhere,  there are not a ICY/ local groupswhose adherence to the election manifesto is nominal and isnot likely to be maintained after the election.  AmongCongress followers in general, there is considerable variety of opinion on the subject of acceptance or non-acceptanceof office and the policy to he followed if office is obtained.  Meanwhile it is clear that left wing leaders suchas Jawahar Lai Nehru himself are interested in the electiononly as a means of preparing for a mass revolutionary movement with the ulterior object of securing independence.          For other groups having similar objects in view,such as the All-India kisan Committee, the elections afford an opportunity of exploiting local grievances and discontent,especially among the rural population and, in courting ruralvotes, even some of the constitutionalists are tending toencourage extravagant expectations which will unsettle thevoters and thus play into the hands of the more revolutionaryagencies.  In the North West Frontier Province, Red-shirtelectioneering activities continue and the tone of the speeches has been bad enough to require action against oneor two speakers.  In the United Provinces, Jawahar LaiNehru&apos;s tour of certain districts produced ratherspectacular demonstrations and illustrated his hold on the
                                                              0. 9                                                    4.popular imagination, &quot;but the financial results of his tourare reported to be more doubtful.4.     A  South African Delegation led by the Hon.  Mr.Hofmeyr have recently made a tour of the principal centres inIndia and visited Simla, where they came in contact with members of the Legislatures.  They met with a cordial welcomeeverywhere and generally left an excellent impression behind them.5.        The anxiety of Indian Moslems regarding british policy in Palestine found expression in a deputation to HisExcellency the Viceroy, consisting of a number of prominentMoslem leaders headed by Sir Muhammad Yakub.  His Excellency1sreply was devoted to the removal of misunderstandings and,in particular, he emphasised that there was no basis for thesuggestion that the sanctity of the holy places of Islam hadbeen violated, and that the conflict was political and racialrather than religious in character.  Generally, the Palestinesituation seems to have evoked comparatively little spontaneousfeeling among the Moslems but it has afforded an opportunityto those anxious to unsettle Moslem feelings or to win their support.   Thus Palestine Day organised by the All-India CongressCommittee was made the occasion for numerous meetingsthroughout the country, mostly of an unimportant character, andthere has been talk of holding an All-India Palestine Conferencein Delhi.  Agitation is, however,  largely artificial and islikely to subside with an improvement of the situation inPalestine.6*        In Bombay a regrettable Communal riot broke out onthe 16th October arising out of the reconstruction of a temple.The rioting, which consisted for the most part of stabbing
affrays between parties of the  two  Communities,  lasted  for five days and resulted in 60  deaths and 500  persons  beinginjured.   By the 23rd October the Local Government were ableto report that the situation  had  returned  to normal.
