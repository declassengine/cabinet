THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERSTY CO? HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).o v n D TP T1COPY NO. ^2CP. 529 (36).C A BINE T.MARRIAGE  BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.    1.  The Standing Committee on this Bill holds its firstmeeting on Thursday, &quot;December 3rd, and the Attorney General,who on the Second Reading, in accordance with the previous cabinet decision (Cabinet 66 (36) Conclusion 12), announcedthat he would attend the Committee and give it such assistance as he could, points out to me that it will hardly be possiblefor him to abstain from indicating a &quot;personal view on some ofthe questions which will arise.  For example, the Bill proposesto abolish decrees nisi and the Attorney General would, I suppose, wish to point out the objections to this course ifcollusive divorce is to be discouraged.  And there are a numberof similar points where a personal view from the attorney general will certainly be expected.    2.  It is of course understood that the Government are neither forming nor expressing any view on the Bill at thepresent stage.  The Attorney General will make this entirelyclear.    3.  The task of the Committee is to put the Bill intoworkmanlike shape before it is reported to the House.  Ata later stage it seems nrobable that some Government viewmust be expressed.    4.  I would suggest to the Cabinet that the attorney general should be authorised to express, where necessary, his personal view on points as they arise, making it clear that heis not expressing any Government conclusions but is merelyassisting the Committee to form a judgment as to the bestform into which to put. the proposals.  It has already-1-
    been decided by the Cabinet  that  Ministers who are not    Cabinet Ministers may vote,  so  of course there will  be no    objection to the Attorney General supporting his view by    his vote in the Committees                             (lnt&apos;ld)  J.  S.Home Office, S.W.1-lst December,  1936.
