I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Excellency herewith a copy of amemorandum in reply to the British memorandum of the 17th September, relative to the preliminary negotiations for the conclusion of a new agreement to replace the Treaty of Locarno.      8861  [13989]                                               B
    I shall be grateful if your Excellency will be so good as to communicate this document, which is not intended for publication, to your Government.    Copies of the document in question  are being transmitted to the German,French and Belgian Governments.                                                            Accept, &amp;c.                                                                CIANO.                           Enclosure 2  in No.  1.                              Memorandum.(Translation.)    THE Fascist Government has carefully  examined  the suggestions  putforward by the British Government in their memorandum of the 17th Septemberlast, in connexion with the diplomatic preparation of the conference of the fiveLocarno Powers, which it is the common wish of the two Governments to see held as soon as possible.    2.  The Fascist  Government have noted with satisfaction that the BritishGovernment share their point  of view regarding the necessity for an exact andthorough  diplomatic preparation  of the conference and  of the usefulness  ofdiscussion between the five interested Governments, before the conference begins,of the principal questions regarding the character and  scope of the agreement which is  to replace the Locarno Treaty.  Among such questions, those mentioned by the British Government appear to the Fascist Government to be of essentialimportance, but, before entering into a detailed examination of them, the FascistGovernment is of the opinion that it should be clearly understood between the five powers who are to take part in the conference what should be the general bases of the new agreement which is to be negotiated between them.    3.  To the Fascist Government it seems that the most practical manner  of proceeding to an exchange of ideas  on this question would be to take as a starting point for the discussions the Treaty of Locarno itself, as it now is;  and, insteadof discussing de novo all the factors which led to its conclusion, to re-examine  in common accord the structure of the treaty, in order to adapt it to those circum-stances which  in the meantime have been subjected to change without,  however,altering either its general plan or its essential characteristics.    4.  The Treaty  of Locarno fruit of long diplomatic elaboration remainsone of the most organic and best conceived instruments for the creation in western europe of those conditions of  security to which our efforts are directed; and  inthe opinion of  the Italian Government the new pact should retain its fundamental principles.    5.  These principles consist in essence of  :  (a) The specific undertaking  ofFrance, Belgium and Germany not  to have recourse to war in any question whichmay arise between them; (b) the joint guarantee by Italy and England of thenon-aggression agreements  between France, Belgium and  Germany which formthe foundation of the Locarno  Treaty.    6.  These two principles are,  moreover, those to which the British Govern-ment rightly refer in the first paragraph of their memorandum.    7.  The question of the guarantee is certainly the one which most especiallyinterests England and  Italy, and on this point the Fascist Government think amore precise exchange of ideas necessary.    8.  From  an examination of the British memorandum, the Fascist Govern-ment have gathered that it is the intention of the British Government to introduce into  the guarantee  system  a  new principle,  that  is to say, the  principle  of reciprocity.  It  seems to emerge from the British memorandum that the BritishGovernment would be ready to renew the Locarno guarantees, so far as concerns the  non-aggression  agreements between  Germany,  France and   Belgium,  in exhange for  similar guarantees   in favour of  Great Britain on  the part  ofGermany against France and on  the part of France against Germany.  Thatwhich in the communique of the 3rd February, 1935, was the principle  on whichthe Air Pact was to be based would  thus come to be used as the organic foundation for the entire system  of guarantees  in the new treaty.    9.  This innovation seems to  the Fascist Government to be of the greatest importance,  and the  Fascist Government would wish to call  the attention of theBritish Government to what would,  in their opinion, be its practical consequences.
    10.  To  begin with,  the Fascist Government have  always regarded  the locarno guarantee as a joint Italo-British guarantee and have always consideredthat the real strength of the Locarno Treaty lay in. the fact that the aggressorwould in every case have found himself faced by the united  forces of the Powerattacked and of the two guarantors.   The joint character of the  Italo-Britishguarantee, and this union of the forces of  the guarantors and  the Power attacked,constituted the fundamental unity for all practical  purposes-of the locarno treaty.    11.  Confronted with the suggestions contained in the British memorandum,the Fascist Government  wonder  whether this  fundamental  unity would  be effectively maintained in a regime of reciprocal separate guarantees, or whetherthe Treaty of Locarno would not become  split into two tripartite systems, whichwould fundamentally alter the position of the guarantors, do  away with the jointcharacter  of the guarantee and, for all practical purposes, transform the locarno treaty into two separate pacts of mutual assistance: one Franco-Anglo-Germanand one  Italo-Franco-German, only  formally  linked  together in the commonframework of a general pact.   In the opinion  of the Fascist  Government, thiswould represent a general weakening of the Locarno system, which it is certainly not the intention of any of the five Governments to bring  about.    12.  It is perhaps unnecessary  for the  Fascist  Government  to  call  theattention  of the British Government  to  the fact that, once  the joint characterof the Locarno guarantee is weakened, the Treaty of Locarno would come to losenot only one of its fundamental characteristics, but also a function to which  anessential importance has always, and rightly, been attributed.    13.  In proceeding  to the examination of the other questions alluded to inthe British memorandum, in regard to which the Fascist Government will  not fail to make their  own position clear, it  seems  to the  Fascist Government to benecessary  that the  States signatories of the Locarno Treaty  should be in agree-ment  as to the character of the new treaty and should settle  whether or not it is their  intention to  reconstruct the Locarno Treaty  on  its  original foundations.    Rome (undated).[C  7572/7284/4]                  No. 2.                   Mr. Eden to Mr. Lloyd Thomas (Paris).(No. 1797.)Sir,                                       Foreign Office, October 22, 1936.    THE French Ambassador called upon Sir R. Vansittart this afternoon and left Avith him a document (copy of which is enclosed), of which, he said, he had given the outlines verbally to me  yesterday (see my despatch No.  1777  of  the21st October).    2.  M. Corbin said that  the Belgian Ambassador in Paris had admitted tothe  French Government that the conduct of the Belgian Government, in making such an announcement without prior consultation, had not been  strictly proper.The French Government were expecting a note from the Belgian Government atthe end of the week, which they hoped would contain the Belgian  answer to theirquestion.  The  French  Government considered  that Belgian security, Frenchsecurity and the Covenant itself had all been endangered or diminished by KingLeopold&apos;s statement, if it were taken literally.    3.  The  Ambassador said that M. Spaak was to make a statement in  theBelgian Parliament on the 27th October, and the French  Government would bevery grateful if we could say a word in support of their views, or  at least tell theBelgian Government our own views, before that date.    4.  Sir R.  Vansittart asked M. Corbin if he had any particular point inmind or if he was only  speaking generally.  M.  Corbin replied that the FrenchGovernment had two definite points in mind.   They desired first that the BelgianGovernment should admit that cases  might arise where  Belgium,  even  if  notattacked herself, should admit the forces of her fellow signatories.   Otherwise,the  Ambassador said,  Belgium would be entirely dropping article 16  of  theCovenant  and would,  moreover, he thought, be putting herself in a dangerous      [13989]                                                    B 2
position.  Secondly, the French Government wanted to have real staff conversa-tions with Belgium and not a mere  &quot; conversation de facade.&quot;  Otherwise the efficacy of French assistance, if need should arise, would be defective.    5.   Finally, M. Corbin  said that he  did not  expect  that  the BelgianGovernment would reply to our note in regard to the  five-Power meeting beforeM. Spaak&apos;s speech, and he earnestly hoped that they would not do so, because the reply might  be better after the speech than it could be  before.    6.   In leaving, he repeated his request that we  should  communicate withthe Belgian  Government before the 27th October.                                                 I am, &amp;c.                                                     ANTHONY  EDEN.                             Enclosure in No. 2.Conversation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the Belgian Ambassador.(Secret.)(Translation.)                                           October 17, 1936.    THE Ambassador expressed his regret that M. van Zeeland and M. Spaakhad not been able to come to the luncheon arranged.  I also expressed my regretand my surprise.   He added that they would perhaps come  next  week,  if  Iagreed. I replied that that would, in fact, be better, since personal contacts were more effective and lent themselves less to misunderstandings than an exchange of diplomatic notes.    M. de Kerchove then told me that in his view French opinion had become tooexcited over the King&apos;s speech as,  indeed, I must have realised after the explana-tions which he himself had given to M. Leger.    I replied :  &quot; That is so, and, indeed, M. Spaak has given similar explanationsto M. Laroche.  Nevertheless, I must express to you once more my surprise, sothat you may bring this to the notice of your Government, first  of all as regardsthe question of form.  I would like you to remind them that as long ago as themonth of July it was M, van Zeeland who spontaneously expressed the desire fora new Locarno meeting at which we should make every effort in our power witha view to a detente and agreement with Germany, failing which solidarity between england, France and Belgium should be strengthened.   I do not feel that theKing&apos;s speech represents the views which M. van Zeeland then expressed.   Inthe second place, at the termination of the London Conference it was agreed thatwe would not undertake  any unilateral action,  and  that we  would only  take decisions agreed upon in common.  This is not the case as regards  the King&apos;sspeech.  At  Geneva  M. Spaak,  in expressing to me certain sentiments  andpotentialities which  were,  in  fact, in conformity  with what emerges  from theKing&apos;s speech, had indicated at the same time that it was only a question ofhypotheses to which his Government had not yet given consideration, and  thatthe Belgian Government would not take  any  decision without having exchangedviews  with  us.  When I indicated to him  the necessity for general  staff conversations, which would place the problem on a military and technical basis, asis essential,  M. Spaak said he agreed and added  that he would send me a note,after having thought the matter over and seen M. van Zeeland.   But the King&apos;sspeech was made without my having received the note in question and withoutthe general  staff conversations contemplated  having taken place.&quot;    M. de Kerchove took note of what I said, adding that, he agreed with it, andwould transmit my views to his Government.    I then called his attention to the psychological effect produced by the King&apos;sspeech.  Whatever its intention may have been, it could not be denied  that it hadbeen interpreted, not  only in France but in the whole of  Europe  and moreparticularly in Germany, as  a notable weakening of  Franco-Belgian solidarityand as a reorientation of policy towards the side of Germany.   The result hadbeen shouts of triumph from the Flemish elements and  the Nazis. It also seemedto me only too clear that the King had put, or seemed to put, France and germany on exactly the same footing, as if there was the same danger of aggression from france as from Germany.  This impression had not been diminished by the speech
delivered by M. Spaak yesterday, in which he declared that Belgium would notin any circumstances give free passage to anybody.  It seemed to me from the psychological point of view equally regrettable that his Government  no  longerappeared to distinguish  between the aggressor and the victim in the case of a conflict,  and that the King, having taken as a starting point for what appearsto be the new Belgian attitude Germany&apos;s unilateral denunciation of the Treatyof Locarno, seemed  to take this into account, not  in  order to react  and take measures against the danger, but to submit to the fait accomfli.     To repair  the psycholgical effect thus produced it seemed to me absolutely necessary that the Belgian Government should  declare publicly in some form orother that the interpretations which I regretted to have to make were false.     M. de Kerchove reminded me of the explanations of which he had just spoken.I replied that  I  had noted them with satisfaction, both as regards Belgium&apos;sfidelity  to the  present  Locarno  agreements and to the arrangements of the1st April, and  further as regards her wish to participate in the conclusion of anew  agreement, the continuation of contacts between the General Staffs, and theaffirmation of her fidelity to the League  of  Nations; but that something more would be needed to put right the effects produced.     I then indicated to him the points which  the French Government would wishto have elucidated.  M.  de Kerchove declared  at once, as was natural, that hecould not answer me, but that he would lay carefully before his Government thequestions which I was about to put to him.     1.   What  is the new international status envisaged by Belgium?   Is shetending towards neutrality in law or in fact ?     The King appears  to speak  with regret (nostalgie)  of the  position of neutrality occupied by Belgium in 1914.  It  does not appear that Belgium had reason  to congratulate herself in this connexion.  Without doubt violation of belgian  neutrality by Germany procured  her,  as it  did also  France, muchsympathy and assistance; but without doubt also it would have been better to haveavoided war by agreements similar  to those of  Locarno, and  above all by agree-ments between the General Staffs, which would have allowed France effectively todefend Belgian territory.     His  impression  was  that Belgium had  no  intention  of  declaring herselfneutral.     2.   Since Belgium had found it necessary to make a considerable military effort, that was without doubt in order to defend the greatest possible area of her territory.  I should be glad to receive confirmation that such  was, in fact, herintention, and  that she  did not  mean  to fall back  upon a mere fraction  of thecountry,  thus leaving open the principal routes for invasion of France.     Here again, the Ambassador felt he could say at once that it was the formerhypothesis which was the true one.     3.   This question,  I  told him,  was essential.    I did  not attach much importance  to  the   discussion   on  the  words:  &quot;Belgium  guaranteed&quot;  or&quot;guarantor.&quot;   It  is not words,  but facts which are of importance.  Moreover,France does not count literally on what is called a guarantee from Belgium.  Shedoes  not envisage that Belgian soldiers should  enter upon her territory to help her.But  the  common defence of France  and Belgium necessitates guarantees  andprecautions.   France cannot  guarantee Belgium except in so  far as the latterallows it; by the right of passage, the right of flight over her territory, the postsof the watcher system, &amp;c, in particular, French assistance to Belgium cannot beimprovised at the last moment; it  must be  minutely organised  in  advance, as hitherto  it has always been foreseen and practised.  Our plans of mobilisationmust be co-ordinated.  That was the meaning which I,  for my  part, attached tothe continuation  of  the  General Staff  conversations, which would be withoutmeaning if such was not  their aim.   I added  that these considerations were evenmore cogent for England than for France.     M.  de Kerchove shared this feeling.  I  next asked him  if in the case of anew  Locarno agreement  Belgium would  envisage parallel conversations withGermany.  Oh  this point M. de Kerchove made an  express reserve.  He did notthink it possible for Belgium, in a general agreement, to refuse to Germany whatshe was giving to France.     I  pointed  out to him that there exist,  besides  diplomatic conventions,realities; that,  once more, we believe Belgium realises that  the  danger fromGermany is not the same as that from France, and that, in consequence, it did
not seem to me permissible that she should deprive herself of means of guardingagainst a real danger in order to enter into agreements concerning an imaginaryone.  M. de Kerchove replied that on this point he could only place the question before his Government.    Finally, I asked him to submit the question with relation to the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, pointing out to him how paradoxical it would be that Belgium,who has always given an  example of  loyalty and  of respect for right, and who,moreover, is a  small country very seriously threatened, should  appear to rangeherself with those countries who wish to destroy collective security by placing the aggressor and the victim of aggression on the same footing.  I pointed out to him in this connexion how much it is in Belgium&apos;s  interest to support the conceptionthat every country should come to the assistance of the State attacked, whereasnow she  seems to incline, towards a contrary conception, since she would  appearnot even to admit the right of passage  in any circumstances.    M. de Kerchove said:  &quot;You are  thinking  of what Belgium  ought to do&apos;if France alone, and not Belgium, were attacked ?&apos;&apos;    I replied :  &quot; Yes, that is the eventuality which must be envisaged from two points of view: first, from the point of view which I have just indicated, and,secondly, in the interest of Belgium itself, who has no guarantee that Germany,while  appearing,  at  first, to  attack  France,  would  not  subsequently  attackBelgium, a fact which, moreover, demonstrates the necessity of the preliminaryagreements of which I have just spoken.&quot;    The Ambassador took note of this question also, which he would bring tothe attention of his Government.    He complained of certain violent utterances in the  press and on the wirelesswith regard to the King of the Belgians, but he thanked me for the improvements which he had noticed in to-day&apos;s  press and which were  due to my moderatinginfluence.[C 7571/4/18]                     No. 3.                    Mr. Eden to Sir E. Ovey (Brussels).(No.  541.)Sir,                                        Foreign Office, October 23, 1936.    THE Belgian Ambassador came to see me this morning, when  he left with me the attached note in reply to the British memorandum of the 17th September.His Excellency went on to  give me some account of the circumstances in whichthe Belgian declaration was made.  He stated that he was in a position to do this,since he had  been over to Brussels in the last day or two, and in the course ofhis  visit  had  had a  conversation  with  King  Leopold,  as well  as  withM. van Zeeland,  M. Spaak and others.  From these conversations  it appeared that the King&apos;s declaration had been a draft of His Majesty&apos;s own composition and that he had  read it at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, over which,contrary to the normal procedure, he had himself presided.  At the conclusion ofthe reading of the memorandum M. Vandervelde had jumped up and had declaredthat it was so good that it must at once be made public.  The Ministers had agreedto this without apparently appreciating the full international consequences oftheir decision.  The objectives which they had in mind  in so doing were limitedto the domestic political field.    2.   Baron Cartier went on to explain the depth of anti-French feeling nowexisting in Belgium.  The attitude of the French press, the  speeches of some ofthe French Deputies, one of whom had spoken of King Albert as having been glad to fly to Havre during the war, had aroused keen resentment among all sectionsof Belgian opinion, Walloon as well as Fleming. Moreover, the French suggestionpublished in  their  press that M.  Spaak should come  to Paris, &quot; or  rather toCanossa,&quot; to explain the Belgian statement  had aroused indignation.   france was altogether too indifferent to the feelings of Belgium. The Ambassador was more worked  up on this subject than I have ever seen him.    3.   In reply  I told the  Ambassador that whatever any of our feelings mightbe about our  treatment by the French nation, or any other nation, we had to be
careful not to allow this to influence our political judgment, since the realities ofthe international situation were not affected thereby.  I therefore hoped that theBelgian Government would, in a communication which I understood they were sending to the French Government, do  all in their power to meet the apprehen-sions of the latter.   These, I understood, related more especially to article 16 andto the position of Belgium under the old and still existing Locarno  Treaty.    4.   The Ambassador undertook to  tell the Belgian Government what 1had said.    5.   His Excellency  emphasised that  if Belgian feeling against France was strong, there was both sympathy for and  support of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  The  Belgian Government were most anxious to help us in any way that they could.    6.   I replied that we fully appreciated this, and were grateful for it.  Atthe same time I felt I must point out  to the Ambassador that the satisfactionwith which the Belgian Government in  their  note  greeted  the fact that HisMajesty&apos;s Government did not ask for a guarantee from Belgium in  the projectednew Locarno, did not seem to me by itself fully  to justify their claim that theyshould not guarantee the French Government either.  The two guarantees werenot on all-fours. In the old Locarno Belgium did guarantee France, though she had never guaranteed this country.   I  therefore repeated  my hope  that hisExcellency would  make clear to his Government our point  of view,  as I had expressed it to him.                                                  1 am. &amp;c.                                                      ANTHONY  EDEN.                            Enclosure  in  No.  3.       Memorandum in reply to the British Note of September 17, 1936.(Translation.)    BY  their memorandum  of the 17th  September the British Governmentwere good enough to communicate to the Belgian Government their proposalsconcerning the subject of the discussion which it is hoped to begin  at Londonbetween the five  Powers signatory to the Treaty of Locarno.  At  the same time they expressed the desire to receive either in writing or orally the observations of the Belgian Government.    2.   By the communique agreed in London on the 23rd July, 1936, &quot; the firstbusiness to be undertaken should be to negotiate a new agreement to take  the placeof the  Rhine Pact of Locarno, and to resolve,  through the collaboration of allconcerned, the situation created by the German initiative of the 7th  March.&quot;The British Note of the 17th September sets out a number of questions which forthis purpose might usefully be  considered by the interested Governments.  TheBelgian Government willingly agreed with the programme thus defined.    3.   In this memorandum the British Government were good enough  to set out what was in a provisional and general manner their view of the different pointsthus enumerated.    In reply to the invitation addressed to them the Belgian Government have the honour to set out in writing their own point of view.    4.   In  regard to the scope of  the  new  agreement destined  to replace  theTreaty of Locarno, the Belgian Government consider that the agreement must provide for  undertakings of non-aggression between the interested Powers.    5.   As  regards  the clauses which are to guarantee the observance of these undertakings, the Belgian  Government were  particularly glad to note  that  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared, as in the  past,  to give Belgium the benefitof their guarantee, which is of great importance for the peace of Europe.    The Belgian Government note with satisfaction that the British government do not subordinate the guarantee which they are disposed to give to  Belgium tothe receipt  of a  reciprocal guarantee.  The  Belgian Government consider thatthis question must so far as they are concerned  be viewed in the same manner bythe other signatory States, and they think it  desirable to explain the reasons.
    6.  As a result of the geographical situation of Belgium, any aggression ofwhich she might be  the victim would be  a  direct menace to other Powers.  Bydefending the access to her own territory Belgium contributes in the most effectivemanner to the security of the States which surround her.  The accomplishmentof this task demands important sacrifices and a very considerable effort.    Conscious of her duties towards the other nations as towards herself, Belgiumis resolved to undertake it.  By so doing she creates for herself a  right in givencircumstances to assistance which  the Powers threatened across her territory would have a vital interest to give her.    She considers that she will by these means fulfil to the limit of  her powers theduty which is hers in this region of Europe which has so often been exposed to theravages of war.   . Belgium will not, however, confine to this her  contribution to  the work of collective security.  She will continue to observe in respect of the obligations ofthe Covenant the scrupulous fidelity which she has always shown in the past.    7.  As regards  special  provisions for dealing  with air attack,  the BelgianGovernment have for more than  a year shown the interest which  they attach tosuch suggestions.    8.  The Belgian Government consider  that the new agreement might well,like the Treaty of Locarno, contain arbitration and  conciliation clauses.    It  is their  view  that  the  settlement  of  the  problems raised by  westernsecurity would greatly help to ensure the peace of  Europe.
