CABINET.          SUPERANNUATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.            Memorandum by the Minister of Health.              I desire to obtain the approval of my colleagues to   the  preparation of a Bill to amend the Local Government and    Other  Officers Superannuation Act, 1922.              The  question of the superannuation of employees in   the  local  government service was reviewed by a Committee, under   the  Chairmanship  of Sir Amherst Selby-Bigge, Bart., K.C.B.,   which  reported in  1927.   The main recommendation of the majority   of the Committee was that provision for superannuation, which is   at present  left to the discretion of individual authorities,   should be made  compulsory,  subject (in the case of &quot;servants&quot;  as   distinguished from &quot;officers&quot;)  to the right  of the employees  of   individual  authorities to decide at stated intervals whether  or   not  compulsory  superannuation should apply to them.   A minority   of the Committee,  however,  were opposed to any provision making   it obligatory on a local authority to superannuate its &quot;servants&quot;   (i.e. broadly speaking,  manual  v/orkers)  on the grounds that   provision was already made  by the Widows&apos;,  Orphans&apos;  and Old Age   Contributory Pensions Acts;   that to a large extent the wages  of   &quot;servants&quot; are governed  by  agreements applying not only to the   employees of local authorities  but  also  to persons performing   similar work outside  local  authority service;   that there was  no   indication of any  widespread demand;  and that the cost  involved   would be very considerable.             The recommendation in favour of compulsion (at  any rate   so far as &quot;officers&quot;  are  concerned)  has  commended itself to my   predecessors,  and, in the  course  of discussion with the interests                              1.
 affected in England and Wales,  this  has  been made  plain, subject always to the caveat  that  compulsion would  not  necessarily apply to servants.   Apart  from  the  reasons advanced  by  the minority, the compulsory superannuation  of &quot;servants&quot; would  embarrass the Government  in its  relations with its industrial employees. Moreover,  it is not essential  in the case of this  class, as it is in  the  case  of  officers, to  secure mobility  in the interests of the efficiency  of  the service.    It is proposed, therefore, that any application  of the principle  of compulsion should extend to &quot;officers&quot;  only, leaving the  superannuation  of &quot;servants&quot;,  as - at  present,  in  the discretion of the authorities by whom they are employed.          Some  modification in the financial basis of the Act,  so far as  future entrants  to superannuation schemes are concerned, is necessary having regard to the change in interest rates since 1922.    The  present rates of contribution are 5fo of remuneration from officers and servants and an equivalent contribution from the local authority.   The Committee above referred to recommended  that the rate for &quot;servants&quot;  should be less than the rate for &quot;officers&quot;.   The Government Actuary has advised thatthe total contribution-required to secure the benefits of theAct for  &quot;officers&quot;  is lS.fo and for &quot;servants&quot; lO^c and it is accordingly  proposed that the contribution to be required from persons brought under superannuation schemes after the passing  ofan amending Bill should he &amp;fo in the case of &quot;officers&quot; and  5fo in the case  of &quot;servants&quot;,  the local authority contributing  an equivalent amount  in both cases.          The effect of the principal provisions of the proposed bill would be as follows     1.   To make  the  Act of 1922 apply,  without adoption, to          all authorities not  having local  Act  superannuation          schemes (except minor authorities such as Parish          Councils, etc.)  and to all their  whole-time officers.
     2.   To require major authorities to set up and maintain          superannuation funds for their own employees and to          admit to them employees of authorities not required          to have separate funds.     3.   To amend the provisions of the Act as to the amount          of the contributions in accordance with the advice          of the Government Actuary, with the differentiation          above-mentioned as between 11 officers&quot; and &quot;servants&quot;.     4.   To empower the Minister of Health for the Secretary          of State for Scotland/ to determine certain disputes.     5.   To give effect to certain amendments of detail          recommended by the Committee and remedy defects which          experience of the working of the Act has brought to          light, and, in particular, to make provision for the          special case of certain transferred poor law officers          and of registrars of births, deaths and marriages.          I am satisfied that on general grounds there is, inthe interests of the local government service, a good case forthe compulsory superannuation of officers.   There is considerable pressure for legislation both by the representatives of localauthorities in England and Wales and by the representatives of the employees, and a promise of early legislation has been given sorecently as this year.          The principles underlying these proposals have forthe most part been discussed with the associations of localauthorities and of employees of local authorities, in Englandand Wales.   These Associations have, in discussion, expressed -themselves as in favour of the extension of compulsorysuperannuation to &quot;servants&quot; as well as to &quot;officers&quot;,  though,with  the exception of the Trade Union Congress,  whoserepresentatives spoke on behalf of  the &quot;servants&quot;,  my impressionis that they do not  feel strongly on the point.    None  of themfavour giving &quot;servants&quot;  in the employ of individual authorities
November 5th,  1936. the right to decide by ballot  whether or  not  compulsory superannuation should apply to them,  as was proposed by the majority of the Committee.           A proposal to leave  the  superannuation  of servants to the discretion of local authorities may be  expected to arouse some criticism from  Labour, but otherwise  the Bill should be substantially non-contentious.           The  Aot  of 1922 applies to  Scotland and it would be , preferable that  any amending Bill should  so apply.   It is known that the National Association of Local Government Officers  (whose  membership  extends to  Scotland) will resist any proposal to  restrict an amending  Bill to England and Wales I understand,  however,  that in  Scotland a large majority of whole-time officers  are already included under voluntary superannuation schemes,  and that the numbers of such officers at  present  outside  superannuation schemes may be so small as t render  difficult, if not impracticable, the application of the compulsory principle in  Scotland,  involving a  wide measure of combination among independent Authorities.   In these circumstances  I appreciate that the Secretary  of State  may wish to consult further with representatives of Scottish LocalAuthorities and others concerned before finally determining the scope of any amending legislation  as  applied to  Scotland.                                       K.W.
