CABINET                       INDIA               Appreciation of the Political Situation,, bythe Government of India, dated 21st November, 1936..              .. Circulated for the information of  the  Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political.-Situation in India, dated the 21st November, 1936issued on the authority of the Secretary of Statefor India.          The crops are generally reported to be excellent,except iii the Bombay Presidency where successive failuresox the Kharif and Eabi rains have resulted in a gravesituation in the Deccan ana ranch Mahals.  Relief works.have already been sanctioned in two districts and Taqaviadvances of over 5o lakhs have been granted.  the distressed areas are receiving assistance from the FamineRelief Bund and public subscriptions..  In Madras and Orisaa,a., severe cyclone caused some damage to property, whileheavy rain in Lucknow resulted in the collapse of a numberof houses, for the rebuilding of which loans are beinggranted.          There have been no marked developments in theelection campaign..  The various parties and groups arestill in the process of sorting themselves out and itcannot be said that the month&apos;s activities, have resultedin any appreciable simplification of. the situation..  TheCongress is. sfill the only party in the field which is.making a., definite effort to reach the electors by putting up front-rank speakers, to tour various provinces, but,in trying to make its appeal too comprehensive, it isfinding some difficulty in meeting all points of view among its possible, supporters..          The selection of - candidates, by Congress: localparliamentary boards has made slow progress, and has ledto much controversy.  In Bengal, the deadlock on the subjectof the communal award persisted until Ja.-vahar Lai Nehru
was recently forced to accept a compromise whichpractically commits Congress to reject the award.  Theresult lias already been to arouse suspicion among the moslems and some support will be lost by this move.In Madras, where Jawahar Lai Hehru conducted another of his electioneering tours and drew the usual largeaudiences, he failed to satisfy the Congress Socialists.-on the one hand or to reassure the land-owners on theother, while his views on tne subject of non-acceptanceof office were opposed to the sentiments of the generality of the local Congress supporters....  After a session atLahore, which revealed serious internal differences,the Hindu Mahasabha has decided to fight the electionseparately, but to co-operate with Congress whenever     ,possible.          The Congress Socialist party, through its localbranches, has shown considerable independent activity.It is apparently prepared to use the Congress platform forSocialist propaganda, but it has attached the selection of Congress candidates and has itself been excluded fromthe first list of Congress candidates published byVallabhai patel. in Bombay.  An illustration  ox the spiritunderlying some of the support which the Congress may receive is found in the election manifesto of the All-r-IndlaTrades Union Congress, which frankly states  that itsulterior object, in participating in the election is toprepare the masses for a direct struggle against theState and that it finds the Congress platform the bestadapted for this purpose.  On the other hand, the democratic Swaraj party of Maharashtra has now definitelysevered itself from the Congress, and announced its aimas the constitutional attainment of independence together
with the reversal oi&apos; the coromunal award and oppositionto socialism and communism.          Among the Moslems there are. few signs ofcohesion as yet and Mr. Jimiah&apos;s efforts to unify themby means of the Moslem League party have met with nosuccess.  His recent visit to the North West frontier province on this mission proved a complete failure.          Generally, excex^t at the meetings of Congress.Socialists, the election speeches delivered have beenmoderate in tone and an improvement in this respect .has followed a. warning to the Congress  parliamentaryBoard in the North West Frontier Province.                    r          After the serious outbreak of communal riotingin Bombay City mentioned in last month&apos;s appreciation,an improvement was maintained during the last week ofOctober, although a few isolated attacks continued to occur.  In November there has been some recrudescenceof trouble and, although casualties, have not beennumerous, a state of tension still prevails.
