Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 315 (36).                               CABINET.    ALLOCATION OF CONTRACTS TO  THE  DISTRESSED  AND                           SPECIAL AREAS.                  Note by the First Lord of the A dmiralty.    THE  attached  memorandum forms one of  the  appendices to the currentAdmiralty Progress Report which is being forwarded to the Sub-Committee on defence Policy and Requirements to-day.  I feel, however,  that the issue is suchan important one that the facts adduced and the conclusions reached should alsobe brought to the attention of the Cabinet.                                                   (Initialled)       S.  H.    Admiralty,  S.W. 1,        November 18, 1936.Memorandum on  the Allocation of Admiralty Contracts to  the Distressed and                              Special Areas.Government Policy in Allocation of Contracts to the Areas.    1.   The  recommendations   of  the  Government  investigators  into  thedepressed areas in 1934 included the designed direction of Government orders tothose areas the Durham report suggested priority other things being equal, theScotland report a certain measure of  priority in shipbuilding-and probablyother orders to the Clyde area,  and the Wales report the guarantee of 10-yearcontracts to firms  who would set up works in the areas.    2.   The policy finally adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government did not allow of an actual price  preference to firms in the special and distressed areas, but onlya preference &quot; other things being equal.&quot;   In these circumstances the Admiraltypractice is to give  sympathetic consideration within the framework of the systemof competitive tendering  to firms in these areas  (with preference when tendersare equal in quality and price and delivery rate is adequate) with special regardto the possibility  of allocating orders to them  when the opportunity arises forwidening the existing field of supply.    3.   The list of areas to which special consideration is given &apos;&apos; other thingsbeing  equal&quot;   comprises  the  special  areas  scheduled in  the  Special  Area(Development and  Improvement) Act, 1934, and certain other areas listed by theMinistry of Labour for  the purpose as  suffering from prolonged  and severeunemployment.  The list is revised by the Ministry of Labour from time to time.    4.   Paragraph 51 of Cmd. 5107 states that the needs of the Special Areas.will  receive  consideration  when arrangements  are  being  made  to  meet requirements under the defence programme.Admiralty&apos;s Position.    5.  The Admiralty&apos;s  biggest contribution to  the relief of unemployment inthe Areas is naturally through the medium of contracts for new ship construction.The fact that the shipbuilding industry and its adjuncts are largely concentrated in the Areas enables a  considerable share of Admiralty contracts to be allocated to them even without the exercise of the preference &quot; other things being equal.&quot;     [14152]
  A good deal of the work is sub-contracted, with the result that it is spread over  a wide area, and all shipbuilders who receive orders are requested when placing  sub-contracts to give consideration as far as possible to firms situated in the areas  where unemployment is exceptionally severe.                       ;  :  Admiralty Contracts Placed.      6.  Returns which  have been  made  from time ;to time give the following  information  about the value of Admiralty contracts placed in the areas :-                                                             Value of contracts                                                                 placed.                                                                              Financial year 1934-35 : Special Areas only      ...     9,093,200          Financial  year  1935-36 :  Special and  other  listed      Distressed Areas     ..................     13,442,000          Period the 1st April,  1936, to the 30th September,      1936: Special and other listed Distressed Areas      ...     14,159,000*           * Approximately 57 per cent, of value of contracts placed in all districts.      7.  It is of interest that  the last-mentioned figure  includes contracts  of   7,787,200 placed in the scheduled Special Areas of England and Wales.      8.  One of the heaviest periods  included in  the six months the  1st April,  1936, to the 30th September, 1936,  mentioned  above was the two months of July  and August, during which contracts amounting to  8,172,460 were placed in the  Special and  Distressed Areas, and of  this amount  7,127,300 represents ships  and ships&apos; machinery.      9.  Among measures pursued by the Admiralty have been arrangements for  building the hull of a cruiser (H.M.S.  Sheffield) at Walker-on-Tyne instead  of  at Barrow, as  provided for in the contractors  tender.  More recently, at  the  contractors  suggestion, we allocated  to Walker  the  hulls of two  destroyers  (Afridi and Cossack).   In  allocating  contracts for steel  structural materials  preference is given  to  steel  makers  in the Special  and  Distressed  Areas.  (E.g., during the twelve months  from June 1935 the more important  structural  steel materials purchased amounted to 37,027 tons in weight. Of this, 31,845 tons,  value  349,850, were allocated to distressed area firms.)  This allocation is in part  &apos;&apos; automatic &apos;&apos; owing to location of firms in the areas, but a much larger quantity  would have been allocated to firms outside the areas but for the preference &quot; other  things being equal.&quot;  Special attention  has  been given to letters from firms  in the areas  included in the flood of applications to tender which followed the  White Paper on Defence (Cmd. 5107).      10.  In  extending  sources  of  supply  the  Admiralty  have allocated  a  considerable volume of work to the  SXGclS,  clS the following particulars will show.  Gun Mechanism Parts.      11.  Two small Educational orders placed with Rose Bros, of Gainsborough.  Gun Mountings.      12.   Armstrong-Whitworth of Newcastle and Harland and Wolff of Glasgow  have been newly brought into this work, and orders have been  placed with them of some  250,000 and  120,000  in value respectively.  An order has also been given to Marshall Sons and Co. (Successors) Ltd., Gainsborough, for  - 5-in. Gun  Mountings, of some  20,000 value. H.A.C.S. Tables.      13.. The Northern Manufacturing  Company have been newly brought in for, this  work and have been given an order amounting to   63,000.  The  Admiralty were, also prepared  to place with their  associated. Company, Rose Bros,  of Gainsborough, an order of   12,000 in value for  Gun  Sights, but the Company could not  undertake this in addition-to H.A.C.S. Tables. Parts,for  Gun Mountings.      14,   Marshall Sons and Co. (Successors) Ltd., of Gainsborough, have recently been brought in for this work and have received orders of about  29,000 in value.
 Torpedo Tubes.     15.  An order for 2 sets of 21-in.  Torpedo Tubes at an approximate total cost of  16.500 was placed in September 1936 with  Sir W. G. Armstrong- Whitworth  (Engineers),  Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne. Torpedo Casings.     16.  A  small order (about  185) has been given to Ashmore,  Benson Pearce and Co. Ltd., Stockton-on-Tees, for Steel  Pressings for Casings. Mines and Sinkers.     17.  Orders for Mines have been placed with  the  N. British Locomotive Co., Ltd., of Glasgow, and orders  for mines and sinkers with Head Wrightson and Company of Stockton-on-Tees. Shell.     18.  Butterworth and Dickinson of Burnley have been newly introduced to this work and have been  given an order worth  19,000, arid a further order for -7-in. practice shot of some  4,000 value.     19.  An order was given to Lang Bridge Ltd., of Accrington, again  newly brought in for this work,  to a value of some  40,000. Fuzes, &amp;c.     20.  An agreement has been negotiated with Messrs. Ferranti, Ltd., for themanufacture of fuzes in a new plant to be installed at Oldham.  A rough estimate of the value of orders over the next three years  is  500,000.  Some orders have already been placed. Gyroscopes for  Torpedoes.     21.   An agreement is being negotiated with Messrs.  Ferranti, Ltd., for the manufacture at Oldham  of Gyroscopes.   The contract under negotiation would be of approximately  200,000 in value spread over three years.Location of New Government Establishments.     22.   The new torpedo factory at Alexandria,  Scotland, is  situated  in  a Special Area, as is the new Mining establishment at Pembroke.  Mention may also be made of  the new Boys&apos; and Mechanical Training Establishment at Rosyth. Although  Dunfermline Burgh, in which  Rosyth is situated,  is not a  listed distressed area, unemployment there is serious, and such neighbouring areas as Inverkeithing and S. Queensferry are actually on the distressed &quot;list.    23.   There is a possibility of a new training centre for Royal Marines, and consideration might be given to a site in South Wales. Transfer of  Unemployed  from Special, &amp;c, Areas to jobs elsetvhere.    24.   In  order to facilitate industrial transference, the Admiralty, in common with other Government Departments, accompanies its contracts with an appealto  contractors to engage any additional labour required through the EmploymentExchanges, which are thereby enabled to put forward for engagement unemployedmen from the areas.  The Ministry  of Labour recently asked that this &quot;appeal&quot;should be replaced by a definite condition of contract making such recourse tothe Exchanges  obligatory upon contractors.  The Admiralty were, prepared togive a 12 months&apos; trial to such a condition, but the War Office and Air Ministry declined to do so, and it  has therefore not been adopted.    25.   The Admiralty  have just decided to set up a  Joint Committee withthe Ministry of Labour on labour  supply  problems affecting either contractorsor  Admiralty Establishments this should enable the Ministry of Labour to make to  the Admiralty any concrete proposals they wish about indiistrial&apos; transference.Further Possibilities.            ^                -          .          Mu&apos;-v    26.  Extensions of works for the production of Admiralty:suppliesrule, required for very special articles which can only be made by firms accustomed to  work of great accuracy.  They must be undertaken by firms of high standing
and the extensions must be in close proximity to their existing factories.  Mostof the necessary extensions, &amp;c, so far as can be foreseen at present,  are nowin hand, so that there is little possibility of  new factories for Admiralty work being erected in the depressed areas.Price Preference.     27.  Allusion  has  already been  made in paragraph 2  to  the fact thatsuggestions for a positive price preference have not so far been approved by theGovernment.     28.  This possibility has been  re-examined.  It would, of course,  be quitesimple to apply such a preference, as we do for Home and Dominion goods against those of foreign origin, but the practical question is whether a preference wouldappreciably help the areas.  On the whole it is considered that,  so far as theAdmiralty are  concerned, it would  not result in any  significant increase in thevolume or proportion of work allocated  to firms in the areas.  For example, theclaims of the various shipbuilding districts to a share of orders are always very carefully considered, and it might  well be the case that a preference  in price to distressed areas would make little or  no difference to the allocation  of workin the long run, but would add to the cost.  Also the bulk of our armament work must go to the firms who have the special equipment  and skilled labour to dealwith it.  The introduction of a positive price preference would be an important new principle  which would  arouse protests from districts  not  scheduled asdistressed or special, yet suffering from a considerable burden of unemployment even the mild expedient of a preference &apos;&apos; other things  being equal!&apos; has  not beenfree from such  criticism.  The list of districts is liable to change as employmentfluctuates.     To sum up      (1) The Admiralty  are doing their best to give work to the Special andDistressed  Areas other things being equal, and to develop new sources of supply in such Areas as far as possible.  A good deal has already been achieved.   Further,the volume of work assigned by the  Admiralty to such areas is likely to increasein the future correspondingly with an anticipated increase in the total volume ofAdmiralty orders.    But there does not  appear to be  much  prospect of any considerable increase in the percentage  (already  high) of Admiralty  ordersassigned to these  areas.  The bulk  of  Admiralty orders must go to firms whoare specially equipped to undertake  them and the scope for preference is limited.The giving of a definite price preference is  deprecated in principle and wouldnot result in any significant increase in work  for the areas in question.     (2) The question of  locating new Establishments in these Areas is of special importance since they have a permanent value. As will be seen from paragraphs22 and 23 above the Admiralty have kept in the forefront the desirability of putting them up in a Special or Distressed  Area, and are strongly of opinionthat this should be the general policy unless  there are very good reasons to thecontrary.   At the moment  no  plans for  further new  Establishments are underconsideration by the Admiralty except those  mentioned above.
