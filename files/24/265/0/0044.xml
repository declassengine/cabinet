Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1936.SECEET.                                                         Copy  No.CP. 324 (36).CABINET.PUBLIC  RECORDS (SCOTLAND).            Memorandum by  the Secretary of State for Scotland.    1.  A NUMBER of Parliamentary Questions have recently been addressedto me regarding Scottish public records.   The Convention of Royal Burghs hasalso submitted a comprehensive Memorandum on the subject, and has asked me,as the responsible Minister, to receive a deputation which I hope shortly to beable  to  do.    2.  There is no doubt that better provision is required for the preservation,care  and custody of public records in Scotland.   Some of the criticisms of theexisting arrangements can be  met  by administrative  action, and need  not be mentioned.   On  three points, however,  I am  satisfied  that  legislation isdesirable,  viz. :     (1)  To provide for the transmission to the  Keeper  of  the  Registers  and          Records of  Scotland of Sheriff Court  records,  and to regularize the          procedure for the periodical transmission to the Keeper of High Court          and Court of Session records.  The existing local arrangements for the          preservation of Sheriff Court records at the Sheriff Courts are in many          cases unsatisfactory.  The Sheriff Court Records Committee (1926)          recommended that provision  should be  made for the  transfer of the          older Sheriff Court records to the Record Office  in Edinburgh for safe          custody and preservation, but hitherto no action has been taken.    (2)  To provide permissive authority  (on the lines of Section  2 of the Public          Record  Office Act,  1838, under which public  records may be placed          under the charge of the Master of the Rolls) for transmitting to the          Keeper, not only State and Departmental papers of Scottish Depart-          ments  or institutions in  Scotland, but, so far  as  may be found          expedient, such papers relating exclusively  or  mainly  to Scotland as          are in the custody of United Kingdom Departments or institutions, as          well as of the Scottish Office in London.  In particular it is desirable          to provide for the transmission to the Record Office in Edinburgh of          a few records which were removed from Scotland by Edward I. These          records are  purely  Scottish  records,  and there is  a .strong desire          among Scottish  people for their return to Scotland.  It appears that          they should have been returned to Scotland under the terms of the          Treaty of Northampton, 1327.   It is  also proposed to provide that          Scottish local authorities may, if they so desire, with the consent of the          Keeper, transmit local records to the Keeper for custody.    (3)  To facilitate the work  of the Record Office in miscellaneous ways  (e.g.,          by conferring powers  on  the  Keeper in regard to the cleaning  and          repairing of records, &amp;c).    3.  These proposals have already formed the subject of consultation with theTreasury, all  United  Kingdom  Departments, the  Public Record  Office  andthe Home  Office.   No  objection of  principle has  been  raised  to  them,  andobservations which have been received on specific points will be incorporated in      [14213]
any Bill which may be prepared.  Some little time, however, must elapse beforedetails can be finally adjusted, and in the meantime, in view of the interest whichis being taken in this matter in Scotland, I am anxious to announce the intentionof the Government to introduce legislation, on the lines above indicated, to make better provision for the care and custody of the Public Records of  Scotland:I should accordingly be glad to have the  approval of my colleagues, to such anannouncement and to the preparation and submission in due course to the HomeAffairs Committee of the necessary Bill.                                                                W. E.  E.    Scottish Office,  Whitehall S.W. 1,           December 3,  1936.
