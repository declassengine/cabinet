Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 308 (36).CABINET.PREPARATIONS FOR THE FIVE-POWER  CONFERENCE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IN my memorandum  CP. 278 (36), which I circulated on the 23rd October,I pointed out the points of difference which had been revealed as a result of thecollation of the various replies  received from the four other Governments whoare concerned in the preparations for the proposed new Western Pact.  On the4th November I addressed a  memorandum  to each of these four Powers, callingtheir attention to the chief of these points of difference.  In this memorandum Iinvited the views of  each Government  as to how this variety of opinion could best  be  reconciled,  and  stated  that it was the  intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to communicate  at  an early date their own views on these matters.    I now submit to my  colleagues  a draft of this further communication.  Itwill be observed that  five  distinct questions are dealt with, i.e.:     (1) The proposal  that  His Majesty&apos;s Government  should be  given  aguarantee by  France against Germany  and by Germany against France.    (2) The proposal that  Belgium should only  receive  guarantees  and not give  any.    (3) The question whether the non-aggression arrangements to be embodied in the new Treaty should  be subject  to any exceptions, and, if so, what should bethe basis of those exceptions.    (4) The question of  the machinery to be provided for reaching a decision as to whether  these non-aggression arrangements had been violated  in  anyparticular case.    (5) The connexion between the proposed new Five-Power Treaty and thesolution of other matters affecting European peace.    It may be convenient to my colleagues if I here summarise  the manner inwhich I  attempt in the present  draft note to deal with these questions.    As regards the  proposed guarantee  to Great Britain,  I have   taken intoaccount the views of  the  Chiefs of Staff as stated in their report CCS. 522 ofthe 9th November, but pending further consideration of this report I  still adhere to the view expressed in my memorandum of the 23rd October, to the effect thatwe should not abandon our request for guarantees.   In the present draft, however,I leave it open to the German and Italian  Governments to give any further ormore convincing reasons  than they  have hitherto done for  appearing to objectto a  guarantee being given to the United Kingdom.    As regards the refusal of Belgium to give a guarantee under the new Treaty,I see no object  in attempting to press  the  Belgian Government in this matter,more particularly since the Chiefs of Staff have said in their Report that they donot attach any particular importance to  Belgium giving  guarantees.  I do,however, propose to ask the Belgian  Government for certain assurances as to themanner in which they will in practice interpret their intention to forbid access to Belgian territory.      8884  [14091]                                                B
    As regards  the  question of exceptions to  the  proposed  non-aggressionarrangements, it is essential, for the reasons  given  in  paragraph  2 of my memorandum CP.  278 (36) of the 23rd October, that there  should be certain exceptions.  The German Government have said that  from their point of viewno exceptions are necessary, and in any case object to the exceptions  being basedon Article 16 of the Covenant.  In these circumstances  it appears to me essential for the success of the negotiations to make an alternative  proposal which would cover all cases in which an exception could properly be made, and which it wouldbe difficult for the Germans to reject.   The suggestion  made in the draft is thatthe basis of  the exceptions should be an attack by a signatory of the  new Treatyupon  a non-signatory in violation of some obligation which is binding upon thatsignatory, whether a general one, such as the Pact of  Paris or the Covenant ofthe League,  or a  special  non-aggression  agreement  with  the non-signatoryconcerned.  This would involve a departure from the scheme of Locarno, but itshould adequately safeguard the French  position as  regards their arrangementsfor mutual assistance with Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, as wellas our own arrangements with Egypt  and Iraq, and  would do  so in a manner towhich it would  be difficult for the Germans to take reasonable objection.    As regards  the question of the machinery to be provided  for determining whether a breach of the non-aggression undertakings has taken place, this assumesparticular importance if there are  to  be  exceptions to those undertakings,especially as the German complaint against the Franco-Soviet Pact was reallythat under it France  would herself decide whether she  was entitled, withoutviolating her Locarno obligations,  to come to the assistance of the Soviet Unionagainst Germany.   Although this  complaint was not, in fact,  well-founded, thepoint is one which  must certainly be met  if the negotiations are to  have a successful issue.   Apart from the fact that I do not wish to see the League side-tracked in this matter, I can think of no better arrangement for this purpose than to confide the decision to the Council of the League, as  was done in Locarno, andthis course has accordingly been advocated in the draft memorandum, which alsoproposes to maintain the Locarno system for dealing with sudden attacks whereimmediate action of the guarantors is necessary, subject to  a subsequent referenceto the Council.    As regards the connexion between the proposed new Treaty and  the solutionof other matters affecting  European  peace,  although  the  question falls into a somewhat different category from those  already  dealt  with, I  have thought itnecessary  at this point to reassert the view of His  Majesty&apos;s Government thatthey consider that the successful conclusion of the new Treaty is not an end initself, but is intended to lead to the solution of other questions which are of direct interest to the peace of Europe.                                                                    A. E.    November 11, 1936.                          NEW  WESTERN TREATY.Draft of Memorandum for communication to the French, Belgian,  German and                            Italian Governments,    IN their memorandum of the 4th November His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom had the honour to invite the Belgian, French,  German andItalian  Governments  to  consider further a number  of  matters in  order  to see whether the various views expressed  by the  five Governments thereon could be reconciled.  In that event it  would be possible  to agree on certain  fundamental principles as a basis  for the proposed conference.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmentadded that it was their intention to make known at an early date their own viewson these matters.    2.  The first of these matters concerns the guarantees to be provided in thenew treaty,  and  in  this  memorandum  His Majesty&apos;s  Government wish,  inparticular, to deal  with  the questions of  a guarantee to this country by Franceand Germany and of a guarantee by Belgium to those two countries.
    3.   As regards a guarantee to the United Kingdom, the German Governmenthave suspended a final expression of their views until they have learned those ofthe other Governments, and the Italian  Government have given reasons why theydoubt the desirability of extending the non-aggression and guarantee obligations of the new treaty beyond the limits of the Treaty of Locarno.    4.   His Majesty&apos;s Government see  no reason to abandon their view that theUnited Kingdom should receive guarantees from France and Germany, but theywould appreciate a  further exposition  of the views of  the German and italian governments on this point.  In this  connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldrecall that in the discussions on the subject of the proposed Air Pact between thefive Powers in the spring of 1935 it was proposed that the guarantees to be givenshould include one to Great Britain by Germany and France; and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were then under the impression that this proposal was agreeable toGermany and Italy.  It is true that on that occasion only air attack was underconsideration;   but it is difficult to contemplate an  air  attack  which will  not involve the other arms.    5.   The second  question arising out of the discussions as to the form of thenew treaty concerns a guarantee by  Belgium to France and Germany.  In their memorandum of the 22nd October the Belgian Government have explained why they consider that it would  be undesirable that Belgium should give a  reciprocalguarantee to any of her co-signatories.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government observe thatthe Belgian  Government undertake to forbid access to the territory of Belgium,and  that they  state that  Belgium  will continue to observe in respect  of  theobligations of the Covenant of the League of Nations the scrupulous fidelity which she has always  shown in the past.   His Majesty&apos;s Government interpret this as implying the intention of  the  Belgian  Government  to  forbid access to Belgian territory by  land and also the  flight across Belgian territory of foreign aircraft to attack a third Power; and, further, their intention to take, should the casearise and in accordance with paragraph 3 of article 16 of the Covenant, &quot; thenecessary steps  to afford passage through their  (Belgian) territory to  the forcesof any of the  members of the League which  are co-operating to protect  theCovenants of the League.&quot;    6.   The third question which  it  is. necessary  to  consider  is whether  theproposed non-aggression arrangements would be subject to exceptions, and, if so,what the nature of these exceptions should be. On this point  there is a difference of opinion between  the views  expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government on the  one hand and the German Government on  the other.While the two former Governments  considered that certain exceptions would benecessary,  the German Government &quot; have no motive for weakening the security for peace which lies in the conclusion of such an agreement for  the renunciation of aggression by demanding exceptions  of any kind whatever.  In ease the otherGovernments concerned should think it necessary to insist on making exceptionsof this kind, it would be for them to put forward proposals to this end.&quot;    7.   His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate that the position  of  theGerman Government may in this respect differ from that of other signatories tothe proposed treaty.  Germany is not  at present a  member of the  League ofNations, and is not, so far  as His Majesty&apos;s Government  are aware,  a party toany  special arrangements  for  the rendering  of  mutual  assistance  against aggression.  The other signatories to the proposed treaty, however,  are all bound by the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and some of them have, in addition, arrangements for mutual assistance  in certain circumstanceswith States who would not be  signatories to the new treaty.  It is obvious thatthe treaty  must not be inconsistent with  the obligations  resulting  from  the instruments referred to; it would, for instance, be impossible for His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment to  become a party to arrangements  which might be incompatible with the provisions of their treaties with Iraq and Egypt.    8.   It appears therefore to His Majesty&apos;s  Government to be inevitable thatthe proposed non-aggression arrangements should be subject to such exceptions asmay be necessary to make them acceptable by those signatories whose position isas indicated above.  If so, the question arises of what should  be the basis of such exceptions.  In  their memorandum of the 17th September His Majesty&apos;s Govern-      [14091]                                                    B 2
ment expressed the view that they should be on the lines which were laid downin article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.  The German Government in their note ofthe 12th October point out that in article 2 of that treaty the important exceptionsare laid down with reference to the Covenant, and in particular to article 16thereof, and they give reasons which in their view preclude the repetition of theuse of this method.     9.  In these  circumstances,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government desire to suggest forthe consideration of the other Governments concerned the possibility of taking asthe basis of the exceptions (apart from the case of legitimate self-defence) an act of aggression by a signatory to the new treaty  against a non-signatory whichconstitutes a violation of some instrument by which the signatory in question is bound.  All the proposed signatories to the new treaty are bound by the Pact of paris, to which almost all the nations of the world are also parties;  all of them,except at present Germany, are bound by the provisions of the  Covenant of theLeague  of Nations;  and any of them may also be parties  to non-aggressionarrangements with particular countries.   It seems to His Majesty&apos;s Governmententirely legitimate, and indeed  necessary, that an attack  by a  signatory to thenew treaty upon  a non-signatory, in violation of  a treaty which is binding uponboth States, should entitle any of the other signatories to come to the assistanceof the victim  of  aggression without thereby violating  its non-aggression under-takings  towards  the signatory concerned.   This  appears  to  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  to  be  the  scheme  of  the  German-Polish  declaration  of  the26th  January, 1934,  since  it is there stated  that the  two Governments  havedecided to base their mutual relations on the principles of the Pact of Paris. Ifthis scheme were adopted, the rendering of assistance in such circumstances to anon-signatory would  not bring  into operation,  on one side  or  the other, the guarantees to be provided in the new treaty.   It appears  to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that an exception on this basis would cover all the cases for which itis proper that provision should be made,  and  they  desire to  commend thissuggestion to the consideration of the other Governments concerned.     10.  The next and  fourth question which arises is how a decision should bereached as to whether the non-aggression arrangements in the new treaty have beenviolated.  If these are to contain exceptions, such as those suggested above, thisquestion assumes  particular importance, for in order  to  determine whether thenon-aggression arrangements have been violated it might be necessary to determine whether a  signatory  had attacked a non-signatory in breach of  an instrumentwhich was binding between them.   It  appears  accordingly  to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be of  particular  importance to provide a method of determiningthis question which should be efficacious, rapid in its action, and such as to com-mand the confidence of  the Governments concerned and of their peoples.     11.   From this point of view,  His  Majesty&apos;s Government remain of theopinion, which they expressed in their memorandum of the 17th September, thatthe best method of determining  this question would be to confide the decision tothe Council of the League of Nations.  In their view the Council, both as regardsits composition and the conditions in  which  it works, would be a more effectivebody for the purpose in  question than any other.  In this connexion the following considerations are, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, relevant.  What-ever changes may be introduced in the working of the League it appears  probable,and it is certainly the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,that  the  peace-preserving  functions  of the  Council  will  become  even  moreimportant than in the past.  It is therefore probable, to say the  least, that in theevent of its being necessary to determine whether a breach of the non-aggressionarrangements had occurred, the  Council would have been dealing with the casepractically from the outset  and would be in  full possession of the facts; andtherefore from the point of view both of the authority which its  decision would carry and  the rapidity with which  such a decision could be given  the council would be a more effective instrument than any other extraneous body.     12.  The German memorandum of the 31st  March, 1936, proposed such anextraneous body  in the  institution of an international court of arbitration whichwould have competence in  respect of  the observance of the various agreementsconcluded.  This proposal  is not repeated in the German memorandum of the12th October, but His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to say that for the purposes
of deciding the question now under consideration such a court, which is apparentlyintended to be an ad hoc tribunal and might well be meeting for the first timewhen it had to decide whether an infraction of the non-aggression arrangements had  taken place, would  not in  their opinion  present,  from the point of vieweither of rapidity of decision, full acquaintance with the facts or the authority which its  decision would  carry, the same advantages as would the Council of theLeague.     13.  The  German Government  now  suggest that the decision should bereached by  a  common decision  of the signatories to the treaty who  are, in a given case, not directly parties to the conflict.  His Majesty&apos;s Government do not see that this solution would present any  advantages  over the course of leavingeach guarantor to decide for itself.  And it is open to a  particular objectionwhich is mentioned in the next  paragraph.     14.  In their observations  on this question  the French  Government,  theGerman Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government all mention the case, whichwas  dealt with in article 4  (3)  of the Treaty of Locarno, of immediate action by the guarantors pending a subsequent  decision as to whether a violation ofthe non-aggression arrangements had taken  place.   His Majesty&apos;s government note that in the German  Governments view &apos;&apos; a distinction  between flagrantbreaches of the treaty and other  kinds of breaches of the treaty such as was laiddown in the old Rhine Pact will no longer come into consideration in the newpact.&quot;  In the view of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government, however (and this view is confirmed by the discussions of the proposed air pact which took place last year),it is no less necessary now than it was previously to make provision for caseswhere a sudden and unprovoked attack (such,  for instance, as an air  attack) ismade in violation of  the non-aggression arrangements.  In such circumstancesimmediate action by the guarantors may be essential, and it would not be possibleto await a decision of the competent body.  It appears, however, to His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be essential to provide, as was  done in the Treaty of Locarno, thatguarantors,  in deciding to intervene, should know that their decision  is subjectto a  subsequent pronouncement by the competent body, so as to ensure that action without a previous finding by that body would not be taken except in cases where no reasonable doubt can exist.  If it is decided to adopt the Council of the Leagueas the body to decide whether an infraction of the non-aggression arrangementshas  taken place, there would be no difficulty  in reproducing the scheme of theTreaty of Locarno in this respect.  If, however, the decision were to be taken, asthe German Government suggest, by the signatories to  the treaty who were not directly parties to the conflict,  the following difficulty  would arise.   If all theguarantors had immediately intervened to assist the signatory attacked, their decision would not, in fact,  be  subject  to any subsequent  control,  because  theyevidently would not concur in a  finding  that they had acted wrongly.   If, on theother hand,  some of the guarantors had intervened and  others had not, it wouldseem unlikely  that it would be possible for a unanimous decision to be reached at all.     15.  In view of all these considerations, His Majesty&apos;s Government remainof the opinion that the best course would be to entrust the decision to the Councilof the League.     16.  Lastly there remains the further point raised in His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s memorandum of the 4th  November, namely, the point that other matters affecting European peace would,  in the words of the communique of the 23rd July,necessarily come under discussion if progress could be made at the Five-power conference. The German Government, in their memorandum of the 12th October,state that they must reserve, until the result of the Five-Power Conference hasbeen reached, their attitude with  regard to the question whether, and if  so, which,other problems might later be discussed.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government feel obligedto make it clear that the  importance which they attach to the successful outcome of the Conference of the  Five Powers is due not only to their wish to see a new treaty take the place of the Treaty of Locarno, but also because they continue toassume that such a successful outcome of  the  Conference of the Five Powers isintended to lead to the solution of other  questions which are of direct interestto the peace of Europe.
    17.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom hope that they may receive the views of the Belgian (French) (German) (Italian) Government on thequestions dealt with in this memorandum at as early a date as possible.    18.  A similar memorandum has been addressed to the French, German andItalian (Belgian, German and  Italian)  (Belgian, French and  Italian) (Belgian,French and German) Governments.
