Printed for the Cabinet. November,  1986SECRETCP.  319  (36).                                THE CABINETNEED FOR  THE EXPANSION OF  SECTION  A OF                  THE ARMY RESERVE     MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE WAR    1. The Home Affairs Committee&apos;s classified  list of  Bills  for the 1936/37 sessionincluded, under the  category of &quot; Bills not  yet ready or Bills required in certainevents &quot;,  a War Office Bill to amend the Reserve Forces and Militia Act, 1898, with anote that it would be urgently required if the steps, referred to in paragraph  5, whichare now being taken  to strengthen the Army Reserve, proved unsuccessful.    2. My colleagues are aware that as a result of the present difficulty in obtainingrecruits the  strength of the Regular  Forces  in  this country is abnormally low andbarely  sufficient  to  maintain overseas garrisons at  the required  level, so  that  theproblem of filling the depleted ranks of the Army at home to meet  unforeseen calls isan acute one.  In a minor emergency, in  order  to fill the ranks, reliance has  to beplaced entirely on Section A of the Army Reserve.    3. Section A of  the Army reserve consists of men who, under the provisions of theReserve Forces and  Militia  Act, 1898, as amended  by the Territorial and reserve forces Act, 1907, agree to be liable during the first two years of their Reserve service to be recalled to the Colours &quot; when  they are required for service outside the UnitedKingdom when warlike operations are  in preparation or in progress,&quot; in circumstances,however, in which it has not been judged  necessary to call up the Reserve as a  wholeby proclamation.   When actually called up they are liable to serve only twelve monthsAvith the Colours reckoned from the date of re-joining.  In consideration of the specialliability accepted  by them, such reservists  draw a higher rate of  Reserve pay, viz.,Is. 6d. a day instead of Is. a day.     4. The number of men  in  Section A is  limited by Statute  to 6,000, but the authorised  strength for which provision is made  in Estimates is  3,000 only.  In thecurrent  emergency  in Palestine,  the whole  of the  infantry reservists  (2,265)  inSection A had to be  recalled to the Colours to bring six battalions of infantry  up toan average  strength of  700.  We were  therefore  left  without any  means  of strengthening  our  infantry battalions should  another  emergency  have arisen.Furthermore, the failure to obtain recruits will automatically add to the existing deficit in the peace strengths in the Regular  Army  Tnfantry  and correspondingly  a greater number  of  reservists  will  be needed  to complete establishments  in  emergency.Immediate steps must therefore be taken to add to the strength of  Section A of theReserve.     5.  The  Treasury have  agreed  to  the  enrolment of 3,000  recruits beyond the number called up for service in Palestine, a total of 5,478 for all arms of the Service. The problem, however, is to  get the  men.   All Infantry reservists who  are eligible within  the existing law and regulations, but  who  have not yet  been  enrolled in Section A, have been circularized  with the result that only about  1,100  additional men have been obtained.  The regulations  themselves can be relaxed so as to allow a man to join the Reserve up to any time within eighteen months  of his leaving the Colours, instead of within  twelve months as  heretofore, and  to join it for any period not extending beyond two years from the date of his transfer to the Reserve, instead of for one year at a time as at present.  This has been done but the further potential assets from this source are not great.COPY  No.  .i dThis document is the property of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;s Government.
(B36/8) 70 12/36  W.O.P. 88     6. It is clear to me that in order to recruit Section  A to the required strength wemust remove the statutory two-year limit.  I propose that  the 1898 Act, as amended by the 1907 Act,  be again amended to provide that the liability of a man enrolling inSection A to be called out may extend  not to the  first two years of his Reserveservice as at present but to the first five years, with the proviso that such liability shallnot  extend  beyond   the  term  of the man&apos;s  normal engagement of  twelve  years(Colour and Reserve service taken together).   Amendment  of the law  on the  above lines would enable me  both  to accept men  in the later years of their  Eeserve serviceand to extend the period for which  men  may  enrol  beyond the present  two years (soreducing the numbers passing out of the Section), as circumstances may require.     7. This  expedient is  one which, from a military  point  of  view, I should havebeen glad to  avoid.   The military efficiency of men who go to the Reserve inevitablydeclines  from the  time they leave the  Colours and, in the  circumstances in which section A reservists are normally called up, it is not possible for them to undergo arefresher course before  being  posted to  their  unit for  sending  overseas ; but in  thepresent circumstances this is completely outweighed by the vital necessity of increasingthe strength  of Section A.  I do not think we need anticipate that the measure will prove a source of controversy in Parliament.                                                                       D. C.     THE WAR OFJTICE,         BOth November, 1936.
