NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR ON THE    POLICY  OF  HIS  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT  IN    RELATION   TO   THE   PRODUCTION   OF   AERO-    ENGINES.  It is desirable  to  commence  by  outlining the factors  whichgoverned the policy of the Air Ministry in regard  to the supply ofaero-engines  for  Service  purposes  prior to the formation  of  the shadow Aero Engine  Scheme in  April, 1936.  These factors  arefundamental  to a correct understanding of the position.  First, the determination of a particular make of aero-engine to beused in a  Service type of aircraft is primarily, a matter for  theaircraft company  who  design and produce  the  aeroplane.   Thedecision is  made  in the light of  the Royal Air Force requirements which  the  aircraft must  fulfil,  and  the aeroplane designer will naturally select a suitable type already in production, or a new orimproved type so far developed as to  have a reasonable prospect ofbeing&quot; available for production in time for his purpose.   It is onlyin special and somewhat rare cases that the Air Ministry decide onthe make of aero-engine to be used in a particular type of aircraft.  Secondly,  it normally  requires  some  five  years of unremittingresearch, experimentation and development to bring to the quantityproduction  stage  a new or basically improved type of engine satis-factory for Service use.  Moreover, the cost  up to that  stage is so great that most  private firms cannot afford to bear the whole of it,and Government assistance  is therefore necessary.  Again, aero-engine firms will normally specialise  either on air-cooled or liquid-cooled types of aircraft,  Thirdly,  owing to  the  higher horse  power required for Servicepurposes,  firms  producing aero-engines for Service use  are, apartfrom occasional  orders for civil aircraft which fall  within the range of horse power, almost entirely dependent on Government  ordersfor their existence.   Any order obtained for foreign governments would normally follow  on orders obtained for the  British Govern-ment.  In  consequence, during  the period of retrenchment  which followed the war, the majority of firms which had catered  for thewar needs of the Royal  Air Force  returned to  their peace timebusiness, leaving only a  few airframe  and engine firms to supply the very limited  requirements of the  Service.  It was, however, the policy of  the Government to interest  andretain the  services of  sufficient airframe and  engine  firms,  notonly to meet their requirements in the various types, but  also topromote a measure of competition,  and to  provide an  incentive
 to new ideas and to the advancement of design.  The firms supply- ing the requirements of the Air Ministry in aero-engines were four m number : Armstrong  Siddeley  Motors, Limited, The Bristol Aeroplane Company Limited,  D. Napier  and Son, Limited, and I tolls Royce,  Limited, two of  these  firms  producing  air-cooled engines  and  two   liquid-cooled   types.   These   firms  by  their unremitting work on research, assisted by the Air Ministry policy of encouragement,  produced a  succession  of  engines of outstanding performance and reliability, which  were  in  advance  of  those  of any other nation.  These four  firms more than  sufficed to supply Air  Ministry requirements,  and at the  same time provided a sufficient measure of competition,  and for these reasons other firms  who desired  to design  and produce  aero-engines  for  the  Air   Ministry  were invariably informed  of the facts  of the situation and their neces- sary effect on Government  policy.  It  was, however, no part  of the Departments  policy to  withhold from  firms which1 embarked on the  design of  aero-engines such technical  advice as could be given when  requested, and  indeed advice was and is freely given in all cases.                                          i  These were  the conditions obtaining in 1929 when Lord Nuffield began  to  engage in aero-engine  construction.  During the yean- that  followed, the  Directorate of Technical Development at the Air Ministry,  with full Ministerial approval, were in touch with the works which Lord Nuffield  had established  and any  advice and technical assistance which  were asked  for were readily given.  On the  25th July, 1935,  Lord Nuffield  wrote  to the Secretaryof State asking  for  an  interview on  the 31st.  The Secretary of State was unable to arrange a meeting on that day owing to otherengagements.  On the  19th November, 1935,  the Secretary of  State wrote toLord  Nuffield  as follows :     Personal.                                        19th November, 1935.    DEAR load  NUFFIELD,     : You will remember suggesting to  me in July that we should    discuss the question of aero-engines, and I was vevy sorry that  . : at, the time I was so pre-occupied with  the new wqrk here that    I was unable to arrange to meet you on the day which you sug-    gested.-  After I first took over, my urgent work was to arrange  .  for  the  execution  of  the  new programme, which necessarily    depended  on certain specified types of machines  and  engines.    In  all  this, as you know,&apos;.I have  had  the constant help of    Lord Weir.  This programme has occupied us both to the full,    but we  are  now able to look further  ahead, and  we should    very much  like to  have a full  talk with you at this  stage.    Would it  be convenient for  you to meet us  on Wednesday,   38935                                                   A 2
     the .27th of November?  T  have provisionally  arranged with     Weir  to keep  the  time from three o&apos;clock onwards that day     free.                                    Yours sincerely,                                  (Sgd.)  P.  CUNTJIKKE-LISTER;.   The Secretary of State and Lord Weir, with  Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, the Air Member for Research and  Development, saw Lord Nuffield and Mr. Cannell  on the 27th November.   At this meeting  Lord Nuffield began  by expressing.his anxiety&quot;about the unpreparedness of the  supply  arrangements  for the production of aero-engines.   The Secretary of State and  Lord  Weir outlined the situation as  regards the  Air  Ministry  expansion  programme, aud the  par- ticular  needs  and   structure  of  the  aero-engine industry.    The existing  programme was within the  capacity of the existing in- dustry, and  the production  of reserves on  the  scale at present anticipated, after the present programme was complete, was prob- ably  also within its capacity.  Both  the  Secretary  of State  and Lord Weir gave it as their personal opinion  that the introduction of a fifth engine firm, if that firm was a large automobile concern, would be  welcome  on  the  ground  of  the production experience which it could  contribute.  At the  same time  they  made it clear to  Lord  Nuffield that the  real  customer  for the  military  aero- engine is the aircraft manufacturer, and an  engine market could not be guaranteed by the Air Ministry, although in certain circumstances- stances the Air Ministry had intervened to encourage aircraft inanu- facturers  to  adopt  a certain  type of engine.   It  became clear  in  the  course of discussion  that  Lord  Nuffield was not  prepared to make any proposal  himself but  stressed  rather the question whether he would be justified in continuing his develop- ment of  the  Wolseley series of aero-engines in view  of the lack of support which  he alleged he had  received from the Air Ministry.   On this aspect of the question Sir Hugh  Dowding  pointed out that when he  was first approached two or three years before by the Wolseley  Company he  had  told  them that  a  military  aero- engine must find its own  market amongst  aircraft manufacturers. The Wolseley firm, however, had specialised  in engines of a horse- power lower than  that  which was  required  by the Air Ministry for  military  purposes, in  the hope of securing a  civil&apos;market. They  had now under development a  600  h.p.  engine,  i.e. the Gemini, which just came within  the  lower end of the military range and the  Air  Ministry  had promised, in spite of difficulties of  arrangement, to provide  an  airframe in  which  this could be tested for endurance  purposes  Jin  the air.  Lord Nuffield  and Mr.  Cannell both  acknowledged  the  assistance which  the Air Ministry was  giving in this respect, but Lord Nuffield went on
to say that  he could  not  see any advantage in going on with thedevelopment of his aero-engines,  although he  and Mr. Cannellwould  think over the points that had  been  given  them  on thegeneral situation  by the  Secretary of iSfcate and Lord Weir.  Lord Nuffield mentioned that he was in a position to manufacturean American engine under licence, and  asked  whether that wouldhe of interest  to the Air  Ministry.  The  Secretary of State andLord  Weir  pointed out that this  would not be  an  attractive pro-posal  for the Royal Air Force.   It was most  desirable  to keep  toBritish types, which were proved and wholly satisfactory, and whatwould  be  required  in a further  expansion  would be a larger pro-(1 net ion of British  types,  which would  fit in  with  the  aeroplaneprogramme-.  Prior to the meeting between the Secretary of State  and Lord,Nulfield, Wolseley  Aero Engines Limited  had written  to the AirMinistry on the 15th October, 1935, bringing to their  notice a range of three medium  powered  air-cooled engines of 155 h.p., 205 h.p..,and 225 h.p.,  respectively, which  had been type-tested  and were then on a production basis.   The  letter stated that  the company had been  requested by several aircraft  firms from time to  time  tofurnish particulars  of their engine development  and  suitability formilitary aircraft.   They  asked  therefore  to be  given  information about new specifications for  which their engine  might be suitable,so, that the  firm might co-operate more  fully with aircraft con-instructors.   A reply  to this letter was held up in view of the Secre-.tary of State&apos;s impending interview with Lord  Nuffield, but a reply was sent on the Gth December, giving as much  information as couldbe released  regarding specifications, but pointing out that only themost  powerful of the engines so far produced by the  firm (Le., theGemini) could he considered for use in  Service aircraft, although(here  was a  possibility  that one  or more types of civil  aircraftemploying some  of the lower powered range  of Wolseley  engineswould be chosen for training  purposes.   In acknowledging thereceipt of this letter Wolseley Aero Engines stated that the informa--tion supplied would be of great assistance to them in  enabling themto put forward to aircraft  constructors the range of  Wolseley aero-engines to meet the various specifications.  The negotiations with  the Wolseley Company in  regard to the shadow scheme are dealt  with at length below and it only remains to deal here with the placing of an  order  for  300 Scorpio engineswith the Company  in August, 1936.  It was  decided during the summer of 1936 to adopt for training purposes a  twin-engined  aircraft developed by the  Airspeed Com-pany  from their civil &quot;Envoy &quot; type.  It was originally  the inten-tion to use another engine for  this  aircraft, but in the course  of-negotiations it was seen that the Scorpio engine presented certain advantages  and a decision to adopt the Scorpio engine was taken on  the 5th August.   Mr. Richardson of Wolseley  Aero Engines&apos;
Limited had already  attended a meeting at the Air Ministry heldon the  20th  July, when he gave details of the engines  which hisCompany could supply, and a letter from the Company followed onthe 25th July, giving particulars of the quantities which  they werein a position to produce.  Following the decision taken on the 5thAugust, Mr.  Richardson  was  seen  by the Assistant Director of contracts (Engines) on 11th, when the Air Ministry procedure forthe placing of contracts was fully explained to him. Mr. Richardsonstated that  there would he no difficulty in the acceptance by hiscompany of an Instruction to Proceed on the lines which had been indicated to him.                                         \\   On the 19th August, the Chief Inspector of Engines in the Aero-nautical Inspection  Directorate visited  the  Wolseley works and discussed the problem of  output with Mr. Cannell,  the  managing director.   The Chief  Inspector was  informed that  parts were in production  for the first batch of 50 engines and  that materialsupplies were available for the second batch of engines.  A letterconfirming the arrangements made  was sent  to the firm on  the21st August and was acknowledged by the firm on the 24th.  On thesame  date two members of the  stall&apos; of the Aeronautical InspectionDirectorate were temporarily attached to the works.  On  the  26th August  Mr.   Boden,  who  had  been  appointedManaging Director of  Wolseley Aero Engines  Limited in place ofMr.  Cannell, telephoned  to  the Assistant  Director of  Contracts(Engines) and after saying that he understood  that Mr. Richardsonhad discussed the issue of a contract with Wolseley Aero Engines,asked how the matter stood.  He was informed that  an instruction to Proceed for 300 Scorpio engines was either in the post or about to be posted.  (It was subsequently confirmed that; the formal I.T.P.had, in  fact, been  despatched before Mr.  Boden telephoned.)  Hethen stated  that in view  of changes  that  had taken place  in  theorganisation of his company it had been decided to discontinue themanufacture of aero-engines.  Arrangements were  immediately put in hand for the  supply of alternative  engines.          The scheme for a shadoio aero-engine industry.  During the early months of 1936 the Government  decided that itwould be necessary to substitute for the  programme  previouslyapproved a  far larger  programme  of  expansion for  the Royal  AirForce.  This decision was announced in the Statement relating to defence (Omd. 5107), of the 3rd March, 1936, and envisaged  notonly a further increase in the  first-line strength  of  the Royal  AirForce, but the building up of  very  large reserves of aircraft and engines.                  .1  The programme was so large that  it was clear that it exceeded the capacity of the existing airframe and aeroengine firms as thep
 constituted.  Two courses were open  to the Government, either to afford assistance to existing aircraft firms to make very large exten- sicxns of their buildings and plant or  to bring in firms outside the aircraft  industry who  would,  in  the  event  of war, be required to turn  to aircraft production.   A great deal of work had already been  undertaken by the Com- niittee  of Imperial  Defence  in  reviewing civil industry and in preparing plans by which the resources of a number of firms would in war&apos;be earmarked for particular types of war production, naval, military,  air, and work common  to all three Services.  Under that allocation  various motor firms  were allocated  to aircraft work. Morris Motors  Dtd.  were allocated not to the Air Ministry, but to the War Office.  This decision had been taken in view, of the great amount of War Office work which the firm normally undertook and of the large demands which the  War  Office would make  upon that- firm in the event of war. The associated  firm of Wolseley Motors Ltd.  was, however, allocated to aircraft work.   The Government  accordingly  decided that they could serve the double purpose of securing the  additional  airframes and  engines which were required by the programme and afford valuable experi- ence  to the firms allocated to aircraft if these firms would  under- take  the erection,  equipment  and  management of  a  series of &quot;  shadow &quot; factories on behalf  of the Government.   Action was accordingly taken in regard to both airframes and engines.   As  regards engines,  the type of engine  required was determined by the  decision with  regard to  the  aeroplanes.   Briefly the  gap which required to be-filled by  production outside the Industry was the production  of a large number of engines of Bristol type.  The Air Ministry, therefore, invited a number  of motor firms  who were allocated for aircraft work to co-operate in the &quot;  shadow &quot; scheme.   The invitation took the form  of a letter  outlining  the scheme which was sent to the Chairman or Managing Director of the follow - ing firms : The Austin Motor  Company  Limited,  the Daimler Company Limited, Bootes Securities Limited, the Rover Company Limited, &apos; Singer  and  Company  Limited,  the  Standard  Motor Company Limited and Wolseley  Motors Limited.   The letter of invitation sent  to Mr. Cannell is reproduced as Appendix I, and identical letters  were sent to the representatives of the other firms.   On the 7th April, 1936, the Secretary of State and  Lord Weir,with  Sir Arthur Robinson, of  the Supply Board, and  members ofthe Air  Ministry met  representatives of  these  seven firms  and explained the position to them in detail. They were asked to assist in securing the production of a given  number of engines  of Bristoltype required for the immediate needs  of the expansion programme,and to utilise this opportunity to the  best  advantage as an  educa- tiou for the role which they might be called upon to  play in time
of war.  The firms were asked tq consider, in consultation with the bristol Company,  what was in their opinion the most practicalway of carrying out the scheme, bearing in mind, first, the import-ance of obtaining delivery  of  ihe  engines  within&apos;the  stipulatedtime,  and,  secondly,  the   desirability  of  giving  the  firms  theexperience which they would require for production of aero-enginesin the event of war.  The   firms  concerned  agreed  to  co-operate  with  the  AirMinistry as a team through  a committee  which they formed at themeeting on the  7th April under the chairmanship of Sir HerbertAustin.  In Lord  Nuffield&apos;s absence abroad, the invitation  to  attend themeeting on  the  7th April was  sent  to Mr.  Cannell, who,  it  was assumed, would represent Wolseley  Motors  Limited.   Some con-fusion arose as to whether Mr.  Cannell was  representing WolseleyMotors  Ltd. or  Wolseley  Aero Engines  Ltd., and at a later dateMr. Lord of Wolseley Motors Ltd., joined the committee.  On the 21st  April the Secretary of the Committee reported to theAir Ministry that  the Committee bad now discussed among them-sefves and with  the Bristol  Aeroplane Company the best means ofcarrying out the programme envisaged,  and  that they were  of theopinion that each  of the shadow  factories set up should undertake the manufacture of a different  group of parts of aero-engines, andthat the assembly and test of the complete units should be under-taken by two factories only.  This  recommendation  was  not  wholly  welcome to the  AirMinistry, who would have  preferred that each engine  should not&apos;have been sub-divided among as many as seven firms.   A meeting was in consequence arranged with Sir Herbert Austin as Chairmanof the Committee on the 30th April, who undertook that the matter should be further  considered by the Committee.  The matter was duly considered by the Committee, and  the AirMinistry were informed on the 7th May that the Committee was definitely arid  unanimously&apos;of opinion that the only safe  and  practi-cal scheme was for each firm to  manufacture one  section only.  The reasons for this advice were:       (1) That  the nnmber  of  machine  tools required for the    scheme would be greatly increased  if each firm  undertook the    making- of  more than  one section  at a time when a serious    shortage of machine tools existed.       (2) That the strain of supervision on the Bristol Company    would be  enormously  increased  if  the  making of ,&apos;the same    sections were undertaken by more  than one firm.  For  these reasons the Committee did  not consider that the pro-gramme could be completed in time except on the basis  of  eachfirm manufacturing one section.            ....             -.&apos;
  On the 6th  May, Mr.  Cannell wrote  to Lord Weir without theknowledge of his colleagues on the Committee, suggesting that theCommittee should  undertake the  construction  of  2,000 Bristolengines,  as in  Lord Nuffield&apos;s opinion  this proposal would be  of greater  value  to  the  Air Ministry than  the  co-operation of theWolseley Company in the shadow scheme.  This letter was acknow-ledged by Lord Weir  and referred to the Air Council, and as aresult Mr. Cannell was informed that the proposal was inconsistent with the policy proposed  by the Committee which the Air ministry had agreed to adopt.  On ithe 16th June, Lord  Nuffield had an  interview  with  LordWeir in  which he expressed concern at the  fact that he did not know how best the production facilities of his company could be utilised.  He asked that representatives of the Ministry should meet mr.  Lord and examine  the general  facilities of the Morris andWolseley companies and discuss the best way of using these facilities in peace  or war.  The  Director of Aeronautical Production accord-ingly visited the Wolseley works.   In  the course of conversationwith Mr.  Lord, he gathered that while  Wolseley Motors would beprepared to participate in the scheme  worked out  by  the Aero-Engine  Committee, they  would greatly  prefer  to  make wholeengines  instead of components only.  Partly as a result of this report by the  Director of AeronauticalProduction, representatives of the seven firms were  asked  to meetthe Secretary of State and Lord Weir again on the 29th June priorto a  meeting which they were proposing to hold with the bristol aeroplane Company on the 30th June, at which decisions wouldbe taken as to the sections to be manufactured by each firm.  Atthis  meeting the Secretary of State reminded  the firms of the objects which the shadow scheme had in view, and said he wishedto confirm finally that the advice of the firms was that these results could best be  secured  by dividing the  work  on  each engine  intoseven parts.  The  success of the scheme was,  he said, a matter ofsuch paramount importance that he had considered  it desirable  tomeet the firms&apos; representatives to be quite sure that  he had under-stood their views correctly, and that the plan  that it was proposedto adopt was indeed the most effective plan  for the purposes in view.In reply, Sir  Herbert Austin,  as  Chairman  of  the Committee,assured the Secretary of State that the whole matter had been most carefully considered.   The  Committee  were  still of the opinionthat  the only safe and practical scheme was for each  firm to rhanu-facture one section only.  The Secretary of State mentioned that be had  been  fed  to  re-open  the  question with  the  firms  sincesuggestions had reached him that some of them had agreed to adoptthe seven-unit scheme  only because they thought it  was a schemefavoured by the Air Ministry.  It would be a most  serious matterif  a  mistake were  made and an  unsuitable  plan  adopted..   SirHerbert  Austin replied that naturally there  was room  for differ-
ences of opinion amongst seven firms.   Some  of them,  includinghis Own company, would, so far as  their own  interests were con-cerned,  have preferred to make complete engines, but such a coursewould not have secured the objects in view.  Sir Herbert Austin&apos;view was confirmed by the representatives of the other firms ;  Mr.Lord stating that  he thought that the  output  required was most likely to be secured by adopting the seven-unit scheme. specialisations-tion was the  simplest and most direct  method,  but he  was,notconfident that the scheme would succeed, and  suggested  that theAir Ministry should  cover  itself  by. obtaining  engines from someother source as well.  He added that though  he had little doubtthat Wolseley Motors  would join the scheme, their  participationmust for the moment be regarded as provisional, as he would need to consult Lord Nuffield.  On the following morning Mr.  Lord telephoned to the  Secretaryof State saying that  Lord Nuffield had now decided that WolseleyMotors  would  not co-operate in the shadow scheme.  The  Secretaryof State accordingly  sent a message: to the  other members of theCommittee who  were meeting at Bristol, asking  them to  proceedwith the scheme  on the basis  that  Wolseley  Motors would not co-operate.                                                ,  ;  Subsequently,  at Sir  Herbert&apos;Austin&apos;s  request, Lord Weir  sawMr. Lord  on the 7th  July and discussed the suggestion thatWolseley Motors Ltd.  should come  back into  the shadow schemeprovided that  the Air  Ministry  purchased  for use as a  shadowfactory  a building at  Coventry  belonging  to  Lord  Nuffield  andcertain  machinery from the latter&apos;s existing aero-engine factory in birmingham.  This proposal  was carefully considered, but the AirMinistry were, for various reasons,  unable to accept the factoryas suitable for the purpose, and Lord Nuffield informed Lord Weirat an interview on the 8th July  of his withdrawal from the scheme.At  the  same time he stated that the scheme had his entire good-will.  Shortly afterwards the agreement  between the Air Ministry andthe Singer Company  that the latter should participate in the schemewas terminated by arrangement, and the Aero  Engine Committeeapproached Wolseley Motors with a proposition that they shouldtake over the share  previously  allotted  to  the Singer Company,together with  the erecting and testing of part of the engines.&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;  On the 7th August  Mr.  Lord telephoned   to the  Director ofAeronautical  Production, saying  that  his firm  were  definitelycoming  in, and after suggesting that the Air Ministry should takeover the factory  discussed previously, agreed to establish a factory in  Birmingham.   An  officer of the Directorate  of. AeronauticalProduction  accordingly  visited  Birmingham  to   make   detailed arrangements  with the  firm and  full  proposals  were submitted ;byMr. Lord in a letter  dated the 14th August.
                          APPENDIX I.Secret.                                               24th March,  1936,DBAU MR. CANNELL,  You will be aware of the general policy which the Government  intends to  pursue in order  to ensure  that civilian industry may be able to play a prompt and effective part in war production should  that be required and also to obtain under the present Defence programmes certain supplies which are in  excess  of the capacity of the normal munitions industries. -  Broadly the plan  contemplates that a number of firms normally engaged on civil  work shall have allotted to them the  particular kind of work theywill be  called upon  to undertake in war, that the necessary steps shall betaken to enable such firms to turn over  rapidly to war work  in case of need; and  that particular  firms should be asked during a  limited period to  produce  certain  munitions to supplement the  output  of  the  regularmunition firms.  Mr. Lord subsequently  resigned  from  bis post of  managing director oi&apos; Wolseley Motors, and Mr.  Boden  was appointed in his place.   On  the  25th August  a  letter, which  is  reproduced  as appendix 11, was sent by Mr.  Boden  to an officer  on the  staff ofthe Director of Aeronautical Production, saying that owing to thechange  in management his company wished to withdraw the pro-posals  contained  in  Mr.   Lord&apos;s letter   of  the  14th  August.Immediately on receipt of this  letter  the  Director of AeronauticalProduction rang up  Mr. Boden  and suggested that he should cometo the Air Ministry  and explain to the  Air Member for Supply and organisation what the position was.   Mr.  Boden replied that hewould be unable to come for 10 days.. lie was  informed that he must come the same afternoon, and did so.   At his interview withthe Air Member for Supply and Organisation Mr. Boden explainedthat when he  had taken  up  the post of Managing Director he hadtaken stock of the situation and  had come  to the conclusion thatin view  of the amount  of  reorganisation  which  was taking placein Morris  Motors Limited  he could  not  in  fairness  to  the AirMinistry continue to carry  on with  the  shadow  scheme  and dojustice to it.  Arrangements  were immediately made to get  in touch with the bristol  Aeroplane Company, and  a representative of the Company-was  interviewed  the same afternoon.  The Company  have  agreedto participate in the scheme and  to  undertake  the assembly  andtesting  in place of Wolseley Motors.  It will be seen from the above statement that the plan which hasbeen adopted  is  that advocated by the experienced firms  who aremaking themselves  responsible  for its execution as the  plan whichin their considered opinion is the most practical  in  all the  circum-stances.  The firms concerned are actively engaged in carrying outthe work.  The preparation of sites and work on the erection of the factories have been  proceeded with energetically.   The greater  partof the machine tools have already been ordered.
  It is  an essential part of the plan that the ordinary civil work  of thesefirms should not  be interfered with,  and that the facilities created  and putin  use  in the present  emergency  shall  remain  in  existence  as  a  &quot; war potential  &quot; when no longer required for current  production.  At the Air  Ministry  I  have  under  consideration the  measures  to  betaken  under the above  scheme  with regard. to aero-engines.   So,m.e. actualproduction of  particular typos  will bo  required, and plans must also  bemade for large-scale production in  time of war.  It is  important that theaction which is taken  to meet  temporary requirements should  be in accord with the  right method to be adopted on a much larger scale in the eventof war.  Certain firms have  been  allocated for the production of  aircraft and/oraero-engines in case of war.   Your firm  is one of these.  Before  taking  decisions as  to the  detailed planning of the war  potentialor the placing of orders for  aeroplane  engines outside the  regular aircraftfirms, I  am anxious to  discuss  with firms  who will be most directly con-corned the best way of  achieving the objects set out in paragraph 4.  Inparticular I would like to  have the  considered  opinion  of  firms  as  towhether production of  engines on a large scale in war would be best obtained by each firm manufacturing complete engines, or  by  an arrangement underwhich  selected  component parts would be  allotted to  particular  firms,with one  or more  central places of  assembly.  It will be appreciated that what is  required  in case of  war is rapid  production  on a large  scale  of definite approved types. The governing factor is how  to  get  quick large-scale production  in  such an emergency.  I  would be grateful if you  could arrange  for a representative  of  yourfirm to  attend  a meeting with  Lord Weir and myself at the Air Ministry,Adastral  House,  on 7th  April  next  at  3.15 p.m. to discuss these  matters.A similar invitation  is  being  addressed  to  certain  other firms  who  are particularly concerned.  You  will appreciate that the subject-matter of  this letter should for thepresent be treated as  strictly confidential.       .    ....      -  It may be convenient  for you to  have before you the Government white paper on  the Defence  Policy  and Programmes and the speech in the Houseof Lords  in which I  dealt  particularly with the  industrial  side of&apos; thisquestion.  Copies are enclosed.                 -                 .      ;                                                    Yours  sincerely,  . i,;                                                               SWINTON.
