Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1936.SECEET.                                                        Copy No.CP.  307 (36).CABINET.PREPARATIONS  FOR  THE FIVE-POWER CONFERENCE.  CIRCULATED BY DIRECTION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.Memorandum by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom regarding   the Agenda of the Five-Power Conference, communicated to the Belgian,   French,  German  and  Italian  Ambassadors  by  Sir R.  Vansittart  on   November 4, 1936.   IN order to prepare the way  for the negotiation of a new treaty to take theplace  of  the^ Treaty of Locarno, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  UnitedKingdom in their memorandum of the 17th September enumerated certain points to which it was felt the attention of the five Governments might well be directed,and which might profitably be discussed by them through the diplomatic channelin advance of any meeting.  The list submitted by His Majesty&apos;s Government wasnot to be considered in any way as exhaustive.   2.  The communications in reply to this memorandum have now been receivedby His Majesty&apos;s Government from the other four Governments.    3.  A comparison of the views of the five Governments as  expressed in these communications reveals not unnaturally a variety of opinions on certain points.His Majesty&apos;s Government would not propose to discuss  at the present stage every point on  which  differing views are held;  but they would suggest  to the otherGovernments concerned that it would  be useful to examine further some of thesematters where they  involve fundamental  issues, in order to  see whether, as aresult of  further elucidation and discussion,  the  various views expressed couldnot be reconciled in such a way as to enable the Governments to agree on certainfundamental principles as a basis for the conference which they have in view.    4.  The subjects which  His  Majesty&apos;s Government would thus invite theBelgian, French, German and Italian Governments to consider further, in thelight of the views which have now been expressed, are as follows : (i) What is to be the form of  the new agreement?    His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  state,  in their  memorandum  of  the  17thSeptember,  that they  &quot; assume that  the new agreement will include  certainnon-aggression arrangements, whereby the participants would agree in no case toattack or invade each other by land, sea or air, or to resort to war against eachother.  (For His Majesty&apos;s Governments views on &apos; exceptions &apos; see point (ii)below.) ....  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  would  be  ready  to guarantee the observance of such arrangements  as  between  Germany, on the  one  hand, andFrance and Belgium, on the other, in return for similar guarantees for the UnitedKingdom from France against Germany and from Germany against France.&quot;    The French Government state, in their memorandum of the 30th  September,that they &quot; consider that  the provisions  of  the  Treaty of Locarno should bemaintained subject to the inclusion of the modifications and additions rendered necessary by present circumstances or  which experience seems to render desirable. Just as the Treaty of Locarno is based upon a guarantee of the territorial status quo  resulting from  the frontiers between Germany and Belgium  and between      [14062]                                                     B
Germany and France, and a guarantee of the inviolability of these frontiers, thenew agreement should be based upon the recognition of the fact that there doesnot  exist  between  the  contracting parties  any  territorial  dispute,  and,consequently,  in their mutual  relations,  upon an  individual  and  collectiveguarantee of  the territorial status  quo  as well as of the inviolability of the frontiers of their possessions and dependencies.  Each signatory would undertakevis-a-vis each of the other signatories not to proceed to any attack or invasion byland, sea or air, and not to resort in any event to force.  (For French governments views on &apos; exceptions &apos; see point (ii)  below.)  In case of failure to observe theobligation of non-aggression, assistance (the obligation to render which must notbe less  extensive than that resulting from the Treaty of Locarno) should be rendered by the other signatory Powers to the Power attacked.....The FrenchGovernment wish to declare at once that,  subject to  reciprocity, they are ready to contract the obligations of guarantee and  assistance referred to above towardseach of the Powers parties to the new agreement.&quot;     The German Government state, in their memorandum of the 12th October,that they, &quot; as already proposed in their peace plan of the 31st March last, regardobligations for non-aggression between Germany, on the one  hand, and belgium and  France, on the other, and the guaranteeing of these obligations by GreatBritain and  Italy,  as the essential elements  of the pact.   The answer to thequestion whether these elements in the treaty should further  be supplemented bynon-aggression and guarantee obligations between other treaty partners will haveto depend on whether such an extension of the  system of the Locarno Treaty is inthe general interests of peace and whether it can be  introduced without upsettingthe necessary balance of the treaty system.  The German Government will only beable to form their final judgment on this  point when they have learned the viewsof the other Governments concerned.&quot;     The Italian Government  state,  in their memorandum of the 18th October,that in  their opinion &quot; the new pact should retain the fundamental principles ofthe Treaty of Locarno.  These principles consist in essence of :  (a) the specificundertaking of France, Belgium and Germany not to have recourse to war in anyquestion which  may arise between them; (b)  the joint guarantee by Italy  and england of the non-aggression agreements between France, Belgium and germany which form the foundation of the Locarno Treaty.....  The Italian Govern-ment have gathered  that it  is the intention  of  the British Government tointroduce into the guarantee  system a new principle  : that of reciprocity.  Itseems to emerge from the British memorandum that  the British Governmentwould  be ready to renew  the Locarno  guarantees,   so  far as concerns  thenon-aggression agreements between Germany,  France and Belgium, in exchange for similar guarantees in favour of Great Britain on the part of Germany against france  and  on the  part  of France against Germany.  That which in  the communique of the 3rd February, 1935, was the  principle on  which the Air Pactwas  to  be based would thus come  to be used as the organic foundation for theentire system of guarantees  in the new treaty.     &quot; This innovation seems  to the  Italian Government to be of the greatest importance, and the Italian Government would  wish to call the attention of theBritish Government to what would, in their opinion, be  its practical consequences.To begin with,  the  Italian  Government  has  always regarded the  Locarnoguarantee as a joint Italo-British guarantee, and has always considered that thereal  strength of the Locarno Treaty lay in the fact that the aggressor would inevery case have found himself faced by the united forces of  the Power attacked and  of the two guarantors.  The joint character of the Italo-British guarantee,and  this union of  the forces of  the  guarantors and the  Power  attacked,constituted the fundamental unity for  all practical purposes of the locarno treaty.  Confronted with the  suggestions contained in the British memorandum,the  Italian Government  wonders  whether this fundamental unity  would be effectively maintained in a regime of reciprocal  separate guarantees, or whetherthe Treaty of Locarno would not become  split  into two tripartite systems, whichwould fundamentally alter the position of the guarantors, do away with the&apos;jointcharacter of the guarantee and, for all practical purposes, transform the locarno treaty into two separate pacts of mutual assistance : one Franco-Anglo-Germanand  one Italo-Franco-German, only  formally linked  together  in  the commonframework of a general pact.  In the opinion of  the  Italian Government, this
would represent a general weakening of the Locarno system, which it is certainly not the intention of any of the five Governments to bring about.  It is perhapsunnecessary for the Italian  Government to call the attention  of  the  BritishGovernment to the fact that, once the joint character of the Locarno guarantee isweakened,  the Treaty  of  Locarno  would  come  to  lose not  only  one  of  itsfundamental characteristics, but also a function to which an essential importancehas always, and rightly, been attributed.&quot;    The Belgian Government state, in their memorandum of the 22nd October,that they &quot; consider that the agreement  must provide for undertakings  of non-aggression between the interested Powers.....The Belgian  Government notewith satisfaction that the British Government do not subordinate the guaranteewhich  they are  disposed to give to  Belgium  to the receipt  of  a reciprocalguarantee.  The Belgian Government consider  that  this question must,  so  faras they are concerned,  be  viewed in  the same  manner  by  the other  signatoryStates, and they think it desirable to explain the reasons.   As  a result of  the geographical situation of Belgium, any  aggression  of which she might  be  the victim would  be a direct menace to other Powers.  By defending the access toher own territory Belgium contributes in the most effective manner to the securityof the States  which surround her.   The  accomplishment of this task demandsimportant  sacrifices and a very considerable effort.  Conscious of her dutiestowards the other nations as towards  herself, Belgium is resolved to undertakeit.  By so doing she creates for herself a right in given circumstances to assistance which  the Powers threatened across her territory would have a vital interest togive her.   She considers that she will by these  means fulfil  to the limit of  herpowers the duty which is hers in this  region of  Europe which  has so often been   *exposed to the ravages of war.  Belgium will not, however, confine to this  hercontribution to the work of collective  security.   She  will continue to observe inrespect of the obligations of  the Covenant the scrupulous fidelity which she  hasalways shown in the past.&quot;(ii) Would these non-aggression arrangements  be subject to exceptions  on  the         lines laid down in article 2  of the Treaty of Locarno ?    His Majesty&apos;s  Government stated,  in their  memorandum of  the 17thSeptember,  that,  in their  view,  the non-aggression  agreements  should  be&quot; subject to certain exceptions on the lines  which were laid down  in article 2of the  Treaty of Locarno.&quot;    The French Government state that the obligation of non-aggression shouldnot impede &quot; the exercise by one of the  signatory Powers of the  right oflegitimate defence, that is, of the right to oppose the violation of the obligationdefined above.....It shall not be possible for the benefits of this new treaty(and, in particular, the obligation to  render  assistance which results from it) tobe invoked by a signatory Power which fails to observe the obligations laid downin it, or which shall undertake in Europe something contrary to the territorial integrity or political independence of another Power, in particular by launchingagainst  the  latter  an  unprovoked  attack.   Consequently,  the principle  ofassistance could not be brought into  force against a signatory State which, inaccordance with the principles of the Covenant of the League of Nations, resistsan act of aggression by one of the contracting parties against a State which isnot a contracting party.  In laying down this principle, the Government of theRepublic have in mind the provisions of article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.&quot;    The German  Government, &quot; in their peace plan of the 31st March, havealready declared themselves prepared  for a renunciation of  aggression vis-a-visBelgium and France unrestricted by                  From their standpoint theyhave no motive for weakening the security for peace which lies in the conclusionof such an agreement for the renunciation of aggression by demanding exceptionsof any kind whatever.   In case the other Governments concerned should  think it necessary to insist on making exceptions of this kind, it would be for them to  put forward proposals to this  end.  Meanwhile, however, the German  Government must indicate at once that they do not consider the method proposed by  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in their memorandum   of  the, 17th  September to  be practicable.  In article 2 of the Locarno Treaty, to which the memorandum refers,       [14062]                                                    B 2
the important exceptions in practice to the provisions for the renunciation of aggression are laid down with reference to the provisions of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, and in particular to article 16 thereof.  The repetition ofthe use of this method is, in the view of the German Government, precluded by thefact that the interpretation of article 16 has led to  the well-known differences ofopinion between Germany  and the other Locarno Powers,  and, furthermore, bythe fact that the discussion regarding the future of article 16 and other provisionsof the Covenant of the League of Nations is at present still quite open.&quot;     The Italian Government do not discuss this question pending a  decision on question (i).     The Belgian Government express no view.(iii) How  shall  a  decision  be   reached  as to whether the  non-aggression         undertaking has been violated?     His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed the view that &quot; the question whetherthe non-aggression undertaking has been  violated should be  submitted  to theCouncil of the League of Nations.   In the case of  a flagrant violation of a frontier,the guarantees might operate immediately, as in the Treaty of Locarno, pending a final pronouncement by the Council.&quot;     The French Government state that  &apos;&apos; at  least  the mechanism contemplated by  the Treaty  of  Locarno  (article 4), which comprises,  on the  one hand, the recognition  by the Council of the  League of Nations of the fact that an act of aggression has taken place, and, on the other,  in the event of a flagrant violation of the above-mentioned  obligation, the immediate application of the  guaranteespending  a  definite decision of the  Council, should be maintained with thenecessary addition to forestall the danger of sudden air attack.&quot;     The German Government &apos;&apos; do not consider it either necessary or appropriate to submit to the Council  of the League of Nations  the question of deciding whether an  infringement of  the  obligation  of  non-aggression has  taken  place,   andconsequently whether the guarantee obligation has entered into force. It wouldbe necessary to examine whether such decisions should not be reached by a commondecision of the parties to the treaty who are not in a given case directly partiesto the conflict.  A distinction between flagrant breaches of the treaty and otherkinds of breaches of the treaty, such as was laid down in the old Rhine Pact, will no longer come into consideration in the new pact.&quot;     The Italian  Government express no view,  in  the circumstances described above.     The Belgian Government express no view.     5.  A further point on which a certain  divergence of view  seems to existconcerns that passage in the London communique of the 23rd July,  which wasquoted in His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s memorandum, and which reads :          &quot; If progress could be made at the  five-Power meeting,  other matters     affecting European  peace would necessarily come  under discussion.  In these    circumstances,  it would be natural to  look  forward to the widening of the     area of discussion in such a manner as to facilitate, with the collaboration of     the other interested Powers, the settlement of those problems the  solution of    which is essential to the peace of Europe.&quot;    On this point the French Government state that their memorandum &apos;&apos; doesnot take into account all the questions which will arise in the course of the forth-coming conference for the solution of which the collaboration of other countries will be indispensable.   It has been purposely limited to the principal problems connected directly with the negotiation  of  the  treaty to be substituted for theTreaty of Locarno, and which,  for this  reason, and subject to the eventualparticipation of the Netherlands in the  negotiations does  not call for the participation of other Powers than the signatories of the last-named treaty.  TheGovernment of the Republic wishes to point out that, in accordance with the spirit
of the arrangement of the 19th March,  1936, and of the London Communique&quot; ofthe 23rd July, this negotiation should be the prelude to a wider negotiation whichimplies the collaboration of the interested Powers.&quot;    The German Government &apos;&apos; assume from the terms of the invitation conveyed to them on the basis of the London Communique of the 23rd July last and their reply  thereto, that the subject to be dealt with by  the conference will be the replacement of the old Rhine Pact of Locarno by a new pact between Germany,Belgium,  France, Great  Britain and  Italy.  If the communique&quot; in questioncontemplates the discussion later on of other problems  connected with the securingof European peace, a decision with regard to these problems (as, indeed, the communique itself indicates) can only be reached when the result of the conferenceof the Five Powers, with respect to the subject to be dealt with at that conference,has been arrived at.  The German Government must therefore reserve till thentheir attitude with regard to the question whether, and if so which, other problems in given circumstances might later be discussed.&quot;    The Italian Government do not deal with this point.    The Belgian Government express no view.    6. His Majesty&apos;s Government desire  to  invite  the views of  the French^)Government as  to how this variety of opinion can best be reconciled.   It is theintention  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government to make at an  early  date  a further communication  to the French(1) Government,  giving their own views on thesematters.    7. As regards subsequent procedure, they would be glad also to be informedwhether, in the view of the French^) Government,  the best method of procedure would be the diplomatic channel, or whether a meeting of  the  representatives ofthe Five Powers should be convened.    8. A similar memorandum has been addressed to the Belgian, German andItalian Governments.(2)Foreign Office, November 4, 1936.(*) Also Belgian, German and Italian Governments.(2) Mutatis mutandis.
