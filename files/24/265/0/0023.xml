DOCUMEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF BIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT.ET.303 (36)COPY NO.41                         6, A B I.&quot; N ET.                   MERCHANT SHIPPING. LEGISLATION.       Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     I desire authority to proceed at once with the preparationof a Merchant Shipping Bill on matters which have arousedconsiderable public interest.  The possibility 0f this legislation was mentioned in the list of Bills for the present session whichwas before the Cabinet on the 21st October. (Cabinet 58 (36)Conclusion 9).  This Bill would deal, in the first place, with two matters requiring immediate legislations  They are:-     (a) Overloading of ships.  As the result of a FormalEnquiry by Lord Merrivale into the loss of the tanker&quot;La Crescenta&quot;, which went down with all hands in the Pacificduring the winter of 1934, a prosecution was instituted against those responsible for the ship&apos;s management.  The main charge was made under Section 457 of the Merchant Shipping  Act, 1894*&quot;for sending or attempting to send a British ship to sea in suchan unseaworthy state that the life of any person is likely tobe thereby endangered&quot;.  The Judge held that there was no evidence to go to the Jury and the defendants were acquitted.     The Judgment in this case left it open to doubt whetherit is possible, in the absence of very exceptional circumstances,to obtain a conviction under the Section quoted above when the offence is sending a ship to 6ea overloaded.  While under thepresent law the actual submersion of the Load Line can be punished by a fine, it is proposed to meet the difficultyarising out of the Judgment by making it an offence, which canbe punished by imprisonment, to send or attempt to send a british ship to sea with the appropriate load line submerged.-1-
no       (b) Life Saving Appliances on fishing vessels.   The  Sea Pish Commission, in their Report dated March, 1936,  recommended that the Board of Trade should have power to make  rules with regard to the Life Saving Appliances to be carried  on fishing vessels, in the same way as they alreauy have power  to make such rules in respect of merchant ships.   At present,  Life Saving Appliances on fishing vessels are dealt with in  the Fifteenth Schedule to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1394.  In  practice, however, the provisions of this Schedule are out of  date and unworkable, tjid there are no effective statutory  provisions applying to Life Saving Appliances on fishing vessels.       There are two other mutters on which it may be necessary  to legislate, and these can be dealt with, if necessary, in  the same Bill.       (c) Steering Gear.   The Reports of the Steering Gear  Committee, which was appointed as the result of the findings  of Lord Merrivale in recent Wreck Enquiries, are under  discussion with shipowners and the Classification Societies.  The Classification Societies are willing to incorporate a  number of the Committee&apos;s recommendations in their Rules, but  there are several outstanding questions of difficulty on which  their agreement has not been secured.   Discussions are still  going on, and if, as I hope, they result in a satisfactory  arrangement *  no legislation v/ill be necessary.  I should, however,  like to have authority to incluae in the Bill provisions on  this subject if a satisfactory agreement is not reached.       (d) I am considering whether anything  can be done to meet  public criticisms which have been levelled at the law regarding  the loading of grain cargoes.   This Bill would be a convenient  place in which to deal with the matter,  and I should like to  have provisional authority to deal with this subject also.                                             W.R.- of Trade,6th November,  1936.              -2-
