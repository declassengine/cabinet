State,for: Scotland                     and the Minister of Health           1.  -/hen the Second Appointed  Lay under the      Unemployment Act, 1954, originally  fixed for 1st March, 1955,      was postponed, the Government agreed that during the period      ox postponement public assistance authorities should      receive  grants from  the Exchequer to put them as nearly as      may be in  the financial position  they would have occupied      had there  been no postponement.  The Unemployment      Assistance (Temporary Provisions) (No.2) Act, 1955,      authorised grants for this purpose  up to 50th September, 1955,      and the  Unemployment Assistance (Temporary Provisions)      (Extension) Act, 1956, extended the period of grant to      51st March, 1956,  The total annual rate ox grant payable      amounted to approximately  5,985,000 in England and Wales      and  1,620,000 in Scotland.           2.  The Second  Appointed Day has been x7ixed for      1st April, 1957, by  an order made by the Minister of Labour      on 28th  July, 1936.  public assistance authorities are      continuing to meet the cost of relief to those ox the      able-bodied unemployed who are on public assistance, but      pending  further Parliamentary authority they cannot be      paid grants from  the Exchequer in this regard for any      period subsequent to 51st March,  1956.-1-&amp;  0 Y E ii S M S  I I
      3.   It is therefore proposed to introduce legislation to authorise a continuance of grants fox  the period of IE months to 31st March, 1937.   On 1st April, 1837. the Unemployment Assistance Board will become responsible for the persons in respect of whose relief these compensatory grouts have been paid and the necessity  for the grants will cease on that date.      4.  The basis of the grants for 1936-37 will be  the same  as provided in the previous Acts, with a modification which will result in the intention of the Government  as referred to in paragraph 1 of this memorandum, being  more closely implemented.   In the course of the debate on  the previous Bill an undertaking was given to consider &quot;hard cases&quot;, that is, cases where it is estimated that the grants calculated on the basis laid down  are insufficient to compensate the authority for the expenditure incurred by them  in consequence of the postponement.   The modification contemplated will empower the Minister, after consultationwith  the local authorities1  associations  concerned, tomake  an increase in the grant in such cases, which are very few in number,  tne additional amounts being provided  by- reductions in the grants of those authorities whose expenditure resulting from the postponement is estimated tohave been less then the grant they would  receive on theprescribed basis.      5.  A draft of the necessary Bill is attached and we should be glad to have the authority of our colleagues toproceed on the  lines  indicated above.   The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer a.grees.   It is desirable that the Bill  shouldpass through all its  stages before Christmas so that  thelocal authorities may receive further grants as early as
possible.  In view of the fact that there may be nomeeting of the Home Affairs Committee in the immediatefuture,, ve ash that the Cabinet should authorise theBill without reference to that Committee.
