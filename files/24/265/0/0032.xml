Policy oncarriage ofArras byBritish ships.documents 2 -A Note circulated by the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs explaining the difficulties of the  situation (Appendix I).    Copies of telegraphic instructions issued to the  Naval Ooinmanders-in-Ohief, Mediterranean and Home  Fleet on 20th and 22nd November (Appendix II).    A letter from the President of the Board of Trade,  who was unable to attend the meeting to the Prime  Minister, dated 21st November? urging that  belligerent rights at sea should be publicly  recognised as soon as possible (Appendix III).                                                   /*       The Foreign Secretary urged that from the pointof view of Foreign policy it would be preferable not torecognise belligerent rights to General Franco&apos;s forcesat present.   The moment for this was unfavourable.General Franco had announced his intention to blockadeBarcelona.-   He could not do this without exercisingbelligerent rights, and by granting them we shouldbe held to be taking a preliminary step indispensable to liis acting, and thus helping his cause,     He hadnot thought it prudent to ascertain the intention ofthe United States of America, but he had no reason tothink that they or any other Government intended togrant belligerent rights.   Prance certainly did not.If we were to grant these rights it would berepresented as following the lead of Germany and Italy,Another reason why the moment was inopportune was thatGeneral Franco was not so.&apos; successful as before,  -andmight not get further successes without even morehelp than he was already receiving from Germany and
Italy.  Information hud lately been received to theeffect that German and Italian officers were walkingabout in Salamanca in their own national uniform.General Franco coulo. not make his threat to Barcelonaeffective without outside help.  It was possible that he might receive aid from German and Italian ships flyingthe Spanish flag.  Again, the result of the blockademight be to curtail supplies of food to Madrid, wherethere was already a shortage, and we ought not tofacilitate this.  If we were to announce that we intended to stop interference with British shipping by either side that would have a tonic effect.  In theHouse of Commons next u.ay, therefore, he would like to announce that we maintained our original position and to accompany the announcement by instructions to british ships not to carry arms to Spanish ports.       The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out thedifficulties on the other side.  The Comrnander-in-chief and the Navy generally in the Mediterranean were placedin a difficult situation by the uncertainties of theposition.  About four British merchant ships were knownto be engaged in gun-running.  It was a tall order to expect the Havy to protect British ships carrying arms from (say) Odessa to Barcelona, more particularly owingto the risk of an incident with German and Italianwarships.  There was a difference between our positionand that of the German and Italian Governments, as theyhad recognised the insurgent Government as the onlyGovernment,  and he did not think that by recognising belligerent rights we could be accused of following their lead. o-6
For we should not he recognising General Franco&apos;s government but merely adopting our traditional attitude in recognisingbelligerent rights,   He Lad Held a Conference with Admiraltyofficers and officials at which all had favoured this course.As a result of this Conference new instructions had been drawn up telling the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,  notto protect British ships which were caught carrying arms to Spain and to allow visit and search (for details seeAppendix III),   The instructions, after amendment, had been approved by the Foreign Office.   Like the Presidentof the Board of Trade he wanted certainty, so he appealedfor recognition of belligerent rights to General Franco.   fHe added that he had met Sir Austen Chamberlain who, despitehis known sympathy for France, favoured recognitionof General Franco.       The Foreign Secretary explained that the new instructionsto the naval Commander-in-Chief had only been issued as atemporary expedient pending a decision on our permanentpolicy.       The Home Secretary pointed out that belligerentrights would involve a good deal more than permission to stop a merchant ship on the high seas and would include such things as the right to take a ship into port, setting upprise courts and issuing lists of contraband.   Legallythey could even stop liners wholesale and., as necessitated by modern conditions,  take  them into port for examination,though in practice they wore unlikoly to go so far.       (The Chief of the Naval Staff entered at this point).       Discussion then took place as to the extent to which british ships were engaged in carrying arms.   It transpired
that information had heon received that about four ships were so engaged on behalf of the Spanish Government andone ship for the insurgents.   British ship owners hadbeen ached by the Board of Trade not to engage in thisbusiness, but it was a lucrative one ana at present theGovernment had no power to stop it as the carriage of warmaterial from one foreign &quot;port to another were perfectlylawful.       One suggestion was that the Government should themselves undertake to stop this traffic by naval means,the necessary legal authority being obtained as soon aspossible and if necessary by act of indemnity.       It was -pointed out that, unless a guaranteewould be given to General Franco that we could and wouldstop the ships he would persist in using his own forces for the purpose.       The Chief of the Naval Staff pointed out that itwould be very difficult for the Navy to guarantee to stopthese few ships from reaching Spanish ports.       It was then pointed out that the policy proposed would be very like saying that we would have grantedGeneral Franco belligerent rights, but that we should prefer to stop the ships ourselves.       The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that we might tell General Franco of our intention to stop the ships and offer, if he had any information to give us as to their movements, to acton it.
       The Rome Secretary sixggested that the policynow being considered merely amounted to an extensionof the Foreign Enlistment Act so as to prevent british ships from carrying war material from foreign ports to spain.       The First Lord of the Admiralty insisted that thepolicy involved a heavy responsiblity for the Navy.       The Chief of the Naval Staff pointed out that it involved watching for these few scattered British shipsday and night and involved something approaching a blockade,.       The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thensuggested that it would be possible to legislate so as tomake the carriage of war material from a foreign port bya British ship a penal offence.   That appeared tobe the mimimum we should do if we v/ere not prepared togrant belligerent rights.,       The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed and recalled that in the case of civil aeroplanes ourpreventive action had proved completely successful.  he presumed that our Navy would take action to make theproposed lav/ effective only outside of the three mile limit.       The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thathe only Government that was entitled to exerciseauthority within the three mile limit was the de jureGovernment of Spain,,       Discussion thesn took place as to the actualoperation on tho spot of the proposed policy and as toGeneral Franco&apos;s probable reaction to it.
          The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that if we were to say that we would not allow a British ship to he captured outside the threemile limit neither General Franco nor anyone else was likely to make the attempt.          The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence-said that in that event we should cither have to take action to treat General Franco&apos;s ship as a pirate orto condone the offence.          The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whatwould happen if a British warship found an Insurgentcruiser taking a British ship in the port.          The Chief of the Naval Staff said that underthe present instructions a British Officer would go on&apos;hoard the merchant ship to check the search.          The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he would prefer the British Officer to he in a position to say -&quot;I will make the search&quot;.   He pointed out that general franco&apos;s object was not to quarrel with us hut toprevent munitions coming from Russia to the SpanishGovernment,   He could, therefore, hardly object ifwe ourselves took action in execution of our own policy of non-intervention for this purpose.          The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the policy proposed would be offering a goodpart of de facto recognition.   In reply to a question,he said that in the American Civil War, we had recognised the Government of the Southern States de factoi and hadgranted Belligerent Rights at an early stage *          The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested thatwe might very soon have to recognise General Franco&apos;sGovernment, owing to the development of the trade negotiations.   This would be an advantage from theAdmiralty point of view as conferring Belligerent Rights.                       - 6 -
           The  Minister for Go-Ordination --if Defence agreed that it would he a good  thing  to seize any favourable opportunity for recognition such as the trade negotiations might afford.           The  First Lord of  the Admiralty  said we appeared to lack contact with General Franco!s Governments           The  Secretary of State  for  Foreign Affairs said we could  get contact very  easily.   In addition. we ought to make a statement here  almost at once. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that even if we granted  Belligerent Bights,  we  should be a long- way off recognising a blockade.           The  First Lord of  the Admiralty  in reply t;? a question  said that one of  the difficulties of the Navy .in dealing with these  ships  was that accurate information was hard to obtain.   It was mostly received from the ports of  embarkation and was too flimsy to  act upon.   No information could be counted on from ships on their voyages.   He felt that our Navy  was in  a special   position  i:a this matter and that we  ought not  to wait on other countries.           The  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in reply to a  question agreed that  if BelligerentRights  were  granted,  we  should be  going towards de  facto recognition to  which it would probablybring us.           The  Secretary pointed out that if our Navywas  to  stop  ships bringing war material to theSpanish Government,  we  should have to be consistentand  stop them  also bringing war material to the insurgents.   That is  to say, the Atlantic ports aswell  as the Mediterranean ports would be involved.
          There was general  agreement that we  shouldhave to stop the ships in &quot;both cases.          The Chancellor of  the Exchequer thenhanded round the following draft which he had prepared:-      (l)    The attitude of  His Majesty&apos;s Government             towards the contending parties has             been and is governed by the             International Agreement for Non-             intervention which has been  concluded             between the countries  concerned,  and             this agreement  has hitherto  rendered it             unnecessary for any further             definition of the attitude of His             Majesty&apos;s Government to be issued.             (Quoted from Foreign Office  telegram             to Paris No. 134 (Saving) 20th November,             1936.)      (2)    His Majesty&apos;s Government in pursuance of             this policy are determined to take             all steps in their power to  prevent             any materials of war being carried by             either side in  British ships.      (3)    They have accordingly authorised their             Naval Commanders in the Mediterranean             to stop any British ship . which,  from             information received from any soiarce,             they have reason to suppose  is             carrying materials of  war to any             Spanish port.      (4)    It is the intention of  His Majesty&apos;s             Government to introduce legislation             to validate any action taken in             accordance with the above decision,             which has at present no legal basis,             including the power to take into  a             British port and search any British             vessel and to confiscate or impound             any materials of war found therein.  -          The following draft preparedsimultaneously by the Home Secretary was also  handed round:-            &quot;We propose  to legislate to secure that             British ships do not carry arms and             ammunitions to  any Spanish port.   (This             is analogous to the Foreign Enlistment             Act.)             We will make it illegal for a British             ship whether chartered er not to  do  so.             This is because we do  not desire             British interests to have anything to             do with the Spanish Civil War.
           The British Navy will have  power to           stop any British ship it suspects and           we will take note of any information           provided.            The Chief of the Naval Staff commentedon the third paragraph of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s draft on the ground that it wouldinvolve instructions tc the Naval Commander-in-Chiefto capture ships sailing to Spanish ports which,as he had already explained, involved great difficulties.          The Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence said the first thing was to decide whether we intended to make this traffic illegal.   If so,it might be possible to stop the practice without &quot;involving Naval action at all.          The Chancellor of the Exchequer saidwe might say &quot;We have authorised the Commander-in-Chief, etc.&quot;.          The Chief of the Naval Staff said theCommander-in-chief would require more detailedinstructions.          The Home Secretary suggested that a shipsailing from say Odessa would be watched and if shewas found to be approaching Spanish waters, theCommander-in-Chief would act.          The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence pointed out that the legal powers alone would be considerable.   For example, they could not beevaded by selling the ship, as transfer from theBritish Register would not be allowed.          The First Lord of the Admiralty said itwould be very helpful in his own position if thematter could be explained to General Franco.
had not much time for legislation.          The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said it would he a very short Bill providing only for preventing arras being carried for either side in theSpanish struggle in pursuance of the policy ofNon-intervention.          The Nome Secretary said that the ForeignEnlistment Act would be cited.   It was already illegalto export arms from this country to Spain.   The newBill would merely make it illegal to oarry them to spain from anywhere.          The First Lord of the Admiralty said hewould like some explanation to be given to general franco before the policy was announced here.          The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said it would also have tobe announced to the SpanishGovernment.   We had no communication with Valencia,but a message could be sent through Madrid.          The First Lord of the Admiralty asked thatif the policy was adopted, the first favourable opportunity should be taken to recognise the insurgents de facto.            The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairspressed for an announcement to be made on the following day.          The First Lord of the Admiralty insisted thatGeneral Franco should be told at least simultaneously.          The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed, but a communication would also have to be madeto the Spanish Government.           The Home Secretary said it would benecessary to consult the Board of Trade.   The bill might involve rather tricky questions about chartersand so forth.   He drew attention to paragraph (d) ef
the iris tract ions of the Cornxnander-in-Ohief cf the22nd November which was equivalent to accordinga  large measure of Belligerent Rights althoughqualified (as the Chancellor pointed out) by thepresence of a British Officer at the search of theship i          A good deal of discussion took place onthis point.          The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the present instructions were, as agreed between the Admiralty and the Foreign Office, only ofan interim character pending the decision on policynow being taken.   He thought that for the remainder of the interim period before the passage sf the Billit would be desirable to go back to the earlierinstructions.          The First Lord of the Admiralty wanted togo straight ahead on the next day and send a message to General Franco, otherwise there was a danger ofthe General thinking that the policy was hostile to him.          The  Secretary of  State  for Foreign Affairs agreedbut didn/^&quot;want to leave the announcement of the policyuntil Tuesday.    If, by any chance, a British shipwere taken into a Spanish port in the interval and thepresent interim instructions were still in force, itmight make it very difficult to announce our policy.          The Prime Minister insisted that the Boardcf Trade must he consulted on the arrangement.
      The  First Lord preferred  to keep the issue of amended Admiralty,  instructions back until a Qommuhica- tion  had  been made to  General  Franco.      The  Chief of  the  Ixaval  Staff explained the diffi- culty of  issuing counter orders.  All these orders had to he issued by  cipher,  whioh took some time.  They had to he transmitted  by  the Commander-in-Chief to individual  ships,  sometimes  commanded by relatively young and inexperienced  Officers.  A good deal of confusion would  be caused.      The  Prime Minister  said a message ought  to be sent to General  Franco  that very  evening to tell him that we intended  to legislate  to stop  arms going to Spain and that  v-&apos;e expected to make an  announcement on the subjeot on Tuesday.  There should, ox  course, be a similar message to  the Spanish Government.       The Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer thought that if an episode  should  happen, that is to say  a British ship  should be captured  in the interim, it could be explained that it  had  occurred before it had been possible  to give effect  to the new policy.  As a matter of fact,  in view jf the  fewness of the ships  involved, an incident was  very unlikely.      The  Foreign Secretary agreed in the latter, especially  as General  Franco did not know of the orders that  had  been issued..      The  Horns Secretary  suggested that if on Monday, after  consulting the Board of  Trade, the Foreign Secretory were to announce that we did not intend to acknowledge General Franco1s Government but that we did intend to legislate to prevent arms going to Spain in British ships, the information would reach all over theworld in  a very  short time.
     The Foreign Secretary pointed out that there  were several Questions  on this subject down for Monday.      The Home Secretary suggested that tho proposedblockade of Barcelona might raise diliioxluies.   If wedia not recognise belligerent rights, what should  wedo if General Franco put his ships round Barcelona andstopped ingress and egress?  Technically he would thenbe a pirate.     The minister for Co-ordination of Defence said it was implicit in the new policy that we would not stand for a blockade.     The Home Secretary saiu that even if general franco did sink a ship it would not necessarily mean that we attacked him.  We should only have a veryserious grievance against him and demand redrsss.      The Chief of the Naval Staff thought it was very unlikely that General Franco would, sink aBritish  ship approaching the  port0     The Prune minister thought the Meeting should adjourn to  -nable the Foreign Secretary to draft his statement and his telegrams.     The Foreign Secretary said he would send telegrams to General Franco and the Spanish Government that.veryevening.  Be felt he was bound to make a statementtomorrow.   In the meantime he asked the First Lord to revert to th? earlier instructions to the &quot;avalCommandei-iij-Chiel.     The Chief of the Naval Staff pointed out that theei feet of that would be that if one of General Franco&apos;sCruisers stopped a Eritish merchant ship the Navy would interfere to protect it.   They would probably receive an S.O.S.  by wireless, and under the forniei instructionsthey would  hav^  to  Intervene.     The Chancellor  of the Exchequer thought it wasnecessary  to communicate  oar intentions to both sides,                          -13-
but he doubted if,  in the interval, it was in the publicinterest to make sue&apos;: an announcement.     The Minister  ioi Co-ordination of Defence thought we could announce  that we had no intention of departing1from our general policy oi non-intervention.     The Foreign Secretary then read  the Borne Secretar.y&apos;draft announcement,  the general tenor of which was dis-cussed and met with approval.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer  thought it would besufficient to announce on Monday that the Government had made up their rinds as to their policy and sh ould explain the r-asons why they could not  announce it, namely, thatthey felt bound to communicate  it  tj  the two parties in spain first.  It would be better not  to mention thequestion o: belligerent rights  in  so  many words untilthe whole policy could be announced.     The Foreign Secretary thought that if a telegram was sent to T-?is Majesty1 s Ambassador  at Hendaye tonightthe drawing up oi&quot;  a Statement to be made on Monday wouldnot be very formidable.     The First Lord again insisted on an explanationbeing sent to General Franco t ; tell him the nature of the  Statement to be made, with  the object oi preventingmunitions being carried by British ships.     The Prime Minister agreed  that the first thine1 tobe done was to get  off that telegram.     The First Lord  asked if the admiralty were to go back to the old instructions.   In  any event the new policy would supersede the old  instructions in certain respects.   In that  event he thought it might be as well to cancel the new instructions  at  once.
         The Chancellor cf the Exchequer pointed outthat whether the old or the new instructions werein force an incident was possible.         The Foreign Secretary explained that ifan incident took place under the old instructions itwould not invalidate the new policy.  If it tookplace under the new instructions,  there was dangerof this,  he pressed, therefore, that the admiralty should revert for the moment to the old instructions.         The First Lord suggested a return to theinstructions of November 20th,         The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencesuggested that in any announcement in parliament it could be said that we were going to protect british ships, provided  that they were not actingcontrary to the policy of Kis Majesty&apos;s Government.         The Foreign Secretary felt some doubt asto whether this formula would meet the case, but thought this might be possible provided itannounced a reversion to the eld naval instructions.
The Conclusions of Ministers may be sunned upas follows:-(a) The general policy of the Government is    one of a continuance oC Non-intervention,    that is to say to take no part in the    conflict on either side.(b) In pursuance of this policy, it is the    intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that    British shipping should not carry war    material to any port in Spain.(c) The best method of securing this is to    legislate so ss to ensure that British    ships do not carry arms and ammunition    to any Spanish port.  This is analogous    to the Foreign Enlistment Act.   The    legislation should Provide that it is    illegal for a British ship, whether chartered    or not, to do so.(d) The Foreign Secretary should the same    evening send messages to the Spanish    Government and to General Franco&apos;s    Government announcing the above general    policy and explaining that in addition to    the action which His Majesty&apos;s Government    have already taken to prevent the export    of arms from this country to Spain, they    are considering what action they themselves    can take to prevent transport of arms by    British ships to Spain.    (A copy of the telegram actually sent is    attached in Appendix IV).(e) The Foreign Secretary should, before making    a statement in Parliament, consult the    Board of Trade as to the feasibility of the    proposed legislation.(f) If possible,  the Foreign Secretary should    announce the policy in the House of Commons    on the afternoon of Monday, November 23rd.(g) The Admiralty should consider the issue of    fresh instructions to the Naval Comnanders-    in-Chief concerned,  in the light of the    statement to be made by the Foreign Secretary.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.22nd November, 1936.
SECRET.                     -SITUATION IN SPAIN.               Q^estgota of Belligerent Eights.     HpJ^hy. the secretary-e tsrvy ^of,State f or Foreign Affairs.     A difficult situation has now arisen which requires  urgentc o n s i de r a t i o n.     In view of General Franco&apos;s apparent intention to attemptto stop and search ships of all nationalities on the Nigh seasit is for us to consider what our attitude should he,  thepresent compromise embodied in the Admiralty&apos;s  instructions tothe Commander-in-Chief being in our view, and also I understandin that of the   Admiralty, untenable for  long.    There are two alternative courses.    Either to accord belligerent rights to both parties, or to continue to maintain  the instructionspreviously issued to  the Fleet,  i.e.  that they  should protect british ships from all interference outside the three-mile limit-     In favour  of course 1 are the following considerations:(i)  In previous civil wars it has been our usual practice to accord belligerent rights to both sides at an earlier stage ofthe conflict, cf.   American Civil War.(ii)   We are seeking  a modus yivendi for  our trade with Spainthrough negotiations  with the Burgos authorities.    If these make progress some form of recognition of the  Franco Government willbe come almos t inevitably table.(Hi)   The  danger  of  incidents under the  instructions  previouslyissued.    If a  warship of the Spanish insurgents should attemptto stop s  British  merchant ship  on the  High Seas it is the dutyof H.M.  shins to protect it.    This may Involve an incident.(iv)   We have information that certain  of our ships have  been carrying war material from foreign ports  to Spanish ports.This is contrary to the spirit if not to  the letter of the
Non-intervention  Agreement.   It would not seem satisfactorythat  British  warships  should have to protect merchant ships carrying  on such  a  trade.(v)   There have Been reports, though as yet unconfirmed, offoreign ships flying the British flag.   If this should become the practice  then Kis  Majesty&apos;s ships might be involved in protecting such bogus  British ships by force against one ofGeneral Franco&apos;s  ships.(vi)  The possibility  that General Franco may succeed in establishing  a blockade, in which case our attitude tobelligerent rights would inevitably have to be reconsidered.      The following are the arguments in favour of course 2,i.e.  against  according belligerent rights:-(i)   In taking this step we are  likely to be  alone among thenon-dictator  Powers.   Neither France nor the United Statesof America, nor,  so far as we are aware any other countrycontemplates  such a course at present.   They intend tocontinue to defend their own ships outside the three-mile limit.(ii)  To grant belligerent rights now might be considered toplace  us in a humiliating position in that we could be accused of having done so only on account of General Franco&apos;s threatand our consequent fear of on incident in the Mediterraneanwith a Spanish ship.   It is extremely important that we shouldshew ourselves strong in the Mediterranean just now, and this step would certainly be interpreted abroad, as weakness.(iii)   Even though, we decide to  resist interference outsidethe three-mile limit it would still be open to either side in the Spanish conflict to take  what action they think fitwithin their  own territorial waters.
           (iv)   To accord belligerent rights is to give de facto           recognition  to General Franco&apos;s Government.   To grant such           recognition  at tne present time, when the military situation           has not changed fundamentally for some weeks, would be           difficult to  justify.   Such recognition would certainly           be interpreted as following at a lesser pace the lead           of Italy ana  Germany.                                                 A.

In the meantime in order to avoid incidentsinstructions (0. in Co Home Fleet) contained in my 1755/19/3(Go in Co Mediterranean) approved by my 2104/15/8 should be provisionally modified to the extent that it is no longer necessary for you to protect ships flying the British flag fromvisit and. search or (if they are carrying war materialdestined for Spain) capture by Spanish warships.3.        Ii you are appealed to for assistance by any british ship which has been stopped, by a Spanish  War vessel,you should enquire whether the ship is carrying war materialdestined for Spain...  If so,  you should inform the masterthat HoM. Government are not prepared to accord himprotect ion.4.        If the snip is not carrying war material destined for Spain you should advise the master to submit to visit and search, but should afford him protection if any attempt is made to capture the ship, or to interfere with hermovements.5.

to the Admiralty.60        Admiralty realise that these instructions representa purely temporary compromise which may be difficult to carryout in practice.  Main objectives are on the one hand to avoid any incidents between H.M. Ships and Spanish warships,  and  onthe other to avoid giving the impression that H.M.  Governmentare not prepared, to afford full support to unobjectionableactivities of British ships.

               APPENDIX III.                                      BOARD OF TRADE,                                          S. W. 1.                                21st November, 1936.My clear Prime Minister,     I am sorry th t I cannot attend the meeting which isto be held to-moraow, but I understand you have alreadybeen told of my position.     In the circumstances it maybe useful if I give you my views in writing.     So far as our trade and. merchant shipping areconcerned,  it is,  I think, desirable that belligerentrights at sea should, be publicly recognised as soon aspossible if we are not prepared in effect to protect british merchant ships against any interference on thehigh seas.     The position under the instructions sent by theAdmiralty to the Commander-in-Chiaf on the 20th Novemberwill be that protection will not be afforded to british ships beyond that which would be given if belligerentrights were recognised.     On the other hand, the UnitedKingdom shipping interests, are under the impression thatthey can count on protection from British warships against any interference on the high seas.    Shipowners were informed that such t.)rotection would be afforded in theearly days  cf the Spanish difficulties and. in the absenceof any notification to the contrary they will assume that full protection will continue to be given.    I understand.that it would, not be consistent with the compromiseadopted that shipowners should be informed of the changeof attitude.                    (i)
     Under the instructions as modified a british merchant vessel,  if stopped fay a Spanish warship, will, on appeal for help to a King1s ship, he informed of theextent to which protection will he afforded.     Once this happens it must he anticipated that weshall have to make public our attitude and the public will want explanations.     The position is full of anomalies and I do not regard the modified instructions as&apos;removing the risk of&quot;incidents&quot;.   I am strongly of the opinion that inthe interests of traders generally and of shippingcertainty is desirable.     I am sending copies of this letter to Edenand to Hoare.                    Yours, etc.                       (Signed)  VhfLTER RUNG MAI.The Right  Hon.  Stanley  Baldwin,  M. P. ,    10, Downing Street,  S. W. 1.
November, 1936.H.  Chilton,ENDAYE.ypher.      Please take immediate steps to get  into touchwith General Franco and give him the following information, which I am anxious should reach him ifpossible before I make public announcement  in Houseof Commons tomorrow afternoon.      H.M.G. have been considering further  theimportation of arms into Spain by sea.   H.H.G.intend to continue not to accord belligerent rights at sea to either side in the Spanish struggle.Their policy is to take no part in the conflict  on either side.   In pursuance of this -policy  it is theintention of H.M.G. that British shipping should not carry war material to any port in Spain.    therefore in addition to the action which H.M.G. have already taken to prevent the export of arms from thiscountry to Spain they are considering what  further action they themselves can take to prevent  transportof arms by British ships to Spain.    A similarcommunication is being made to the  Spanish  Government
