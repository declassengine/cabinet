CABINET.             RATIFICATION 0? THE LONDON NAVAL TREATY 1956.             Memorandum Joy the First Lord of the Admiralty.              At its Meeting on March 13th, 1936, the Cabinet     decided -         &quot;To authorise the signature of a Three-Power Naval          Treaty on the understanding that it would not be          ratified unless or until a corresoonding bilateral          Treaty was concluded with Germany&quot;.     When this decision was taken negotiations with Germany     were only in an early stage and negotiations with Soviet     Russia had not commenced.  The position is now quite     different.  The negotiation of the agreements is now well     advanced, and the outstanding points of difference are few.     Subject to some unforeseen happening the conclusion of these     two agreements now seems probable.              The London Naval Treaty, 1935, comes into force on     1st January, 1937, if ratified by all three signatory Powers.     If not ratified by that date, it comes into force as soon     as all the ratifications have been deposited.   The U.3.A.     have ratified the Treaty;  France has not yet ratified but     the indications are that she will follow this country&apos;s lead     in fee matter.              If the Treat?/ does not come into force on the     1st January, 1937, an interval will then begin during which     there will be no limitation of sizes of ships and guns by     international agreement at all, and there will be nothing to     prevent any country, should it be so minded, from making a     radical departure from Treaty limits in the interval between     1st January, 1937, and the coming into force of the Treaty.     There are many objections to such an interval, and on the     assumption that we are finally going to ratify the Treaty     there are many advantages in doing so before 1st January, 1937.
     Before a decision can be arrived at it will  be ncees aryto take into account not only the factor of the negotiations withRussia and Germany mentioned above but also the negotiations withJaoan with regard, to the 14&quot; gun.   Unless Japan has signified.her acceptance of the 14&quot; gun before the Treaty comes into force,we shall lose this gun, and the maximum calibre will beincreased to IS&quot;.  From this point of view, therefore,  there arestrong arguments in favour of deferring ratification until thelatest date up to which the question of the gun calibre for capital ships can be kept open, i.e. 1st April, 1937, if by so doing there is any reasonable hope that Jaoan may accept the14&quot; gun-   Once this point is clear,  however,  it would be very important to ratify,  and so, to the best of our ability, ensurethe Treaty coming into force as soon as possible.   From allthe above points of view it aonears very desirable that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be in a  position to ratify at very short notice should they wish to do so.     An incidental advantage of bringing the Treaty intoforce early,  if it can be done, is its effect on Italy, sinceCount Ciano has recently stated that Italian accession &quot;mightbe difficult&quot; until the Treaty had been ratified.     I therefore suggest that the following action should betaken:-     (a)  The Cabinet should be invited to revise their         decision of March 18th,  1936, in the sense that         the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and         the First lord of the Admiralty should be given         discretion to decide,  in consultation, when the         appropriate moment has arrived for1 ratification.     (b)  All arrangements should be made here and in the         Dominions to permit of ratification at short         notice.
(c) The French Government should be invited to    conform t?ieir orocedure to ours,  so that,  if    negotiations proceed satisfactorily the Treaty    may come into force as from January 1st.(d) The Italian Government should be asked to  give    a written assurance that they will accent  the    14-inch gun maximum if Japan accents it.(Infld)  S.  HoAdmiralty.14th December, 1936.
