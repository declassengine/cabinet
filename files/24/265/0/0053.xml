(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS gRITAMIC 2IAJE5TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET                                               COPY NO (/&apos;;.CP. 333(36)                        CAB I N E T.              WAGES OF FARM ,SERVANTS IN SCOTLAND.      Memorandum by the Secretary of State Tor Scotland..          In July last my predecessor circulated to the cabinet a Memorandum (C .P .205 (36))  asking authority for the preparation ofa Bill relating to the conditions of employment and remuneration of farm workers in Scotland.    At its meeting on 29th July theCabinet decided (Cabinet 55(36) Conclusion 16) that the terms to beinserted in the Bill should be submitted to it before the Bill itself was presented to the Committee of Home Affairs.     At the present moment  the whole cereals position is  beingconsidered, and it is possible that a policy may be decided upon,the announcement of which would provide a suitable  opportunity forintimating a decision to proceed with legislation dealing withScottish agricultural wages.    I am anxious to be in a position totake advantage of such an opportunity and I therefore think it rightto bring the  matter before  my colleagues now.     Consultations as to the  recommendations of the DepartmentalCommittee by which this matter was recently reviewed have takenplace with representatives  of farmers&apos; and farm servants&apos;organisations in Scotland,  with special reference to the  question,referred to in the previous memorandum, whether the proposed central board should have power to  vary the findings of the district committees.   As was anticipated,  a cleavage of opinion was foundbetween employers and employees,  both on the principle, of wageregulation and on the particular point of the powers of theCentral Board.                                                          1/  .
           I have carefully reviewed the position in the light      of the discussions which have occurred, and I have reached      the conclusion that legislation diould be proceeded with.      I would propose that this should be generally on the lines      of the existing English Act - a brief summary of the main      provisions of which, as proposed to be adopted,  is attached -      and that the Departmental Committee^ recommendation that      the Central Board should be given powers to vary the findings      of the District Committees should be departed from.   In      other respects such legislation would be in conformity with      the Committee&apos;s proposals.           The reasons which have led me to reject the CommitteeTs      proposal as to the powers of the Central Board are those      to which my predecessor referred in his memorandum in July.      The proposal in question was rejected by Parliament in 1924;      it is not now in operation in England;  and it is unpalatable      to the farmers.           I accordingly ask the approval of my colleagues to the      preparation and submission to the Committee of Home Affairs      of a Bill on the lines indicated;  and to the making of an      announcement,  at such time as seems appropriate,  that      legislation is to be proceeded with.                                         W.E.E.Scottish Office,    4th  December, 1936.
     Summary of Main Provisions of Agricultural Wages        (Regulation) Act, 1924,d?proposed to be applied&quot;&quot;                       to Scotland.     A Scottish Agricultural Wages Board and such number of district agricultural wages committees as may be considered necessary will be set up.   The Board and Committees willeacn include representatives of employers and employees inequal numbers, with one or more impartial members.     Each wages committee will fix minimum rates of wages foragricultural workers in its district, and may cancel or varysuch rates.   When minimum rates have been fixed (or cancelledor varied) the committee will report its decision to theWages Board, which will make an order giving effect to theCommittee&apos;s decision.     If a committee fails to fix a minimum rate,, or hy aresolution of its representative members asks the Board to fix, cancel or vary a minimum rate, the Board will beempowered to fix, cancel or vary the rate as the case .requires.     The Secretary of State will be empowered to direct aCommittee to reconsider a minimum rate which it has fixed.     Provision will be made for penalties, regulations, theappointment of officers, expenses, etc.
