CAB I N E T.                  JOURNALISTS (REGISTRATION) BILE.              Note by the Lord Presi dent., of the Council.              I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to       a point in connection with the Journalists (Registration) Bill.       This is a Private Member&apos;s Bill, which is the Second Order on       friday next, 4th December;  there may9 in fact, not be time       for its consideration before four orclock.              The Bill is open to some objection from the point of       view of the Privy Council Office.  Under it,  all Regulations       made by the Journalists Registration Council would require       the approval of the Privy Council.   No uermission was sought       before this provision was made, and it is undesirable that       the promoters of Private Bills should be able at will to       impose duties on the Privy Council.              At oresent the Privy Council, except in one case,       anoroves Regulations of statutory bodies only under Measures       introduced by the Government of the day.   The exception is       under the Architects Registration Act;  but this was promoted       by the Royal Institute of British Architects, a Chartered       body over which the Privy Council had exercised a  measure of       control for nearly a century.   Moreover,  in every case the       regulations have related to matters, such as medicine or       pharmacy,  in which the Privy Council had a direct or       traditional interest.   Such is not the case with the present       Bill, and I do not think that the proposal should be allowed,       by tacit acceptance, to create a convenient precedent for       other bodies which may wish to be associated with the       Privy Council.-1-
             It may well be that the &quot;Regulations of the     Journalists Registration Council,  if it should ever be     constituted as -proposed in this Bill,  might appropriately     be approved by another Department  and not by the Privy     Council,   In this connection,  I would observe that the     Board of Trade are already responsible for the Statutory     Register of Newspaper Proprietors  and Newspapers under     the ITewspaner Libel and Registration Act, 1881.                              (Infld)   J.  R. M.Privy Council Office.28th November,  1935.
