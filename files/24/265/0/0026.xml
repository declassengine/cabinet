CABINET.CIBRALTAR  AS A LINK  IN  IMPERIAL  AIR  COMMUNICATIONS.               THE PROBLEM OF ESTABLISHING AN AIR BASE.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE herewith, for  the consideration of my colleagues, the text of a Secret despatch which I have  just  received from General Sir CharlesHarington, Governor of Gibraltar, in  which he states his views on the proposalfor the establishment of an air base at Gibraltar on a site to  be reclaimed fromthe sea.

APPENDIX.Secret Despatch from General Sir Charles Harington, Governor of Gibraltar, to       the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated November 2, 1936.(Secret.)Sir,                                          Gibraltar, November 2,  1936.    I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret  despatch ofthe 1st October asking for my  observations on  the proposal contained  in J.D.C.Memorandum 264, for the establishment of an air base at Gibraltar  on a site tobe reclaimed  from the  sea.  I have carefully  studied  the  Memorandum,  andperforce must agree  with the considered conclusions of the Joint Oversea  and home  Defence Committee  that there would  appear  to be  no  satisfactory alternative to the  provision of the area required by reclamation, and that  the siteproposed is the only practicable one.    2.   The necessity for an air base here is fully appreciated, whilst  it is equallywell realised that its  importance  in  connection  with  the whole strategicalconception of  Imperial Air Defence makes it essential that other interests, subjectto safeguards as far  as possible, must be subordinated to it.    3.   Many questions of  detail must naturally arise at a later stage,  but forthe present I  confine  myself to more or  less general remarks.    4.   The  political aspect,  that  is,  the possible  reaction in  Spain to thedevelopment of the proposed scheme, is  perhaps not directly within my province,for this must have already  received the consideration of Plis Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs advisers in consultation  with the British Ambassador.  That it will giverise to criticism and representations is beyond doubt, irrespective of  the party      [14098]                                                      B
 that may be in power.  All classes in that country are, not unnaturally, at least sentimentally jealous of the British occupation of the Rock of Gibraltar.   Time has done nothing to eradicate this feeling, and, as has been indicated in previous correspondence, the restoration or recovery has been referred to in propaganda issued  by  practically all the many and varied factions  which  exist in  that unfortunate country at present.  Amongst others,  the Fascist party has given prominence to the  subject, and it is, I feel sure,  needless for me to mention the significant liaison which now undoubtedly exists between that party and its allied groups,  and the so-called Fascist Powers  of Europe, from  whom they  would endeavour to enlist sympathy, at least.  Furthermore, there might  well be a tendency to appeal to general foreign opinion on the grounds that advantage was being taken of  the  present turmoil in Spain to  increase  British  territorial jurisdiction.     5.   It is noted that  the opinion of the Law  Officers of the Crown is being sought on the legal question regarding British rights in the British zone  of the Neutral  Ground  and the  adjacent territorial waters.  As these officers will have been furnished with the full history of this difficult and delicate problem, together with the records of the views of their learned predecessors upon which previous decisions have been framed, I confine myself to stating that I cannot conceal from myself, and from you, that an adverse  legal  decision would have  highly  incon- venient,  if not serious, consequences.     Amongst  other  considerations, I   would mention that  it  is   becoming increasingly apparent that the area of the Rock is inadequate for many purposes. Slum clearance, with  building expansion, for example, is an essential modern development in the general interests of both Colony and Fortress, and this will not be practicable unless further encroachment for building purposes is made on the North Front,  subject, of  course, to defence requirements.   Some such encroach- ment has been made in  the past, without recent protest  from our  immediate neighbours, and I can see no adequate reason why this &quot; peaceful  penetration &quot; should not continue.  The huge platform under the  air base scheme, which it  is proposed to push towards Spain, is hardly within the same category.     6.   I now come to the civil Government aspect.  The comparative magnitude of the proposed  reclamation  gives  room for  a deal of thought  and a certain amount  of alarm, particularly as regards the  encroachment  on to part of the commercial  anchorage,  and  the smothering  of certain  civilian enterprises established  along  the  waterfront affected.    At one  time,  too,  there  was  a possibility  that  the  scheme  might  adversely  affect  the  local  and  important Gibraltar-Tangier  steamship service, but investigation shows  that this is not necessarily so.   I have satisfied myself  that a certain amount of inconvenience which may be caused can be, and will be, loyally accepted by  the steamship  firm of Messrs. Bland and Co.     The anchorage to be encroached upon by reclamation is mainly  used by small craft. I have no reason to anticipate, however, that  any difficulty that may arise cannot be overcome without serious detriment.   In  fact, the situation may provide me with an opportunity of clearing that part of  the Bay of certain superfluous and derelict craft.     In connection with the properties along the present waterfront, admittedly a certain amount of hardship and inconvenience may be occasioned, but for the bulk of them alternative accommodation can be found provided that the opinion of the Law Officers is not against the development of North Front.  The exception is the ship-building and repair yard of Messrs. Bland and Co.  This yard is now the only  one of its kind in Gibraltar, and its loss  would hit the firm very hardly and  would also remove an enterprise of value to commercial small shipping. In the event of it not proving possible to find the firm another site with access to the Bay or Admiralty Harbour a question of compensation may arise.     7.  From another  civil standpoint, I view the proposal of an  aerodrome at Gibraltar with considerable  interest.  The absence  of  such a  facility has been long felt, and through it the Colony has no place in the aerial sun.   I realise that there may be difficulty about civilian aircraft using a Royal Air Force landing ground, but if international Air Conventions will  permit of such a ground beingmade available, under necessary control and  restrictions, for certain  approvedBritish flying concerns  only, there would be hopes  of  the revival  of  Gibraltar
Memorandum on the Military Aspect on the Proposal to Establish an Air Base             at Gibraltar on a Site to be Reclaimed from the Sea.    IN J.D.C. Paper 142 (Revise), paragraph 10, it is stated:  &quot;In view of theimprobability of war with Spain, the Committee  (of Imperial Defence)  have not taken into account land attack by that country.&quot;    The Defence Scheme, however, has always envisaged the possibility of raidingattacks, either sea-borne or across the land frontier.    2.  In War  Office letter No.  024/861 (M.0.2), dated the 23rd September,1936 (C.R7 Gibraltar/31916/10), it is stated : &quot; The Army Council do not proposeto consider amending J.D.C. Paper 142 (Revise) pending a review of the  situation at the termination of the present disturbances in  Spain.&quot;    3.  It must be emphasised that any aerodrome at Gibraltar,  whether whollyreclaimed from the sea or encroaching on &quot;British Neutral Ground,&quot;  is quiteundefensible against a serious attack from  Spain, and  particularly exposed toany form of  raiding attack.    4.  For  the safety of  the Fortress against a raiding attack, the  followingpoints have been held as  vital:      (a) The maintenance of only one entrance into Gibraltar, i.e., The Causeway,          with a water obstacle on each side.    (b) The maintenance of a clear field of fire from the Fortress over this Cause-          way and over  all approaches thereto.    (c) The  maintenance of  a &quot; Tank Trap &quot; in  the water obstacle on each side          of the Causeway.    5.   In accordance with the above points, it is  essential that the South-Easterncorner of  the proposed  aerodrome, as shown on the  sketch  map  attached toJ.D.C. 264, should be modified so as to maintain a  continuous water obstacle on theWest of The Causeway between the Aerodrome and the Fortress.    The exact width of the obstacle can be settled after a review of all the factors involved, but a minimum of  100 yards is suggested, which should.suffice to makeassault bridging impracticable.

This point, I submit, has an Imperialas well as a local significance.    8.   The purely military point of view regarding the scheme is contained inthe enclosed  copy of a memorandum prepared by my General Staff representative,with the terms of which I am in  full agreement.  I am enclosing an additionalcopy of this despatch  for transmission to the War Office.    9.   Like so many of Gibraltar&apos;s problems,  the question at issue has also a naval bearing.  I have shown the correspondence to and discussed it with the rear-Admiral in Charge, and feel that  I cannot do better than transmit to you acopy of a memorandum on the subject submitted by that officer to My Lords of theAdmiralty.  I concur with the views of Rear-Admiral Pipon  as to the possibleclanger of the commercial anchorage being detrimentally restricted should anyattempt be made strictly legally to partition the narrow Bay of Gibraltar.   Thissleeping dog should be allowed to lie peaceably.    10.   I am afraid that I appear to have pointed out nothing but difficulties,but  I consider that if the scheme is one of vital importance to Imperial interests,as it would appear to be on the information supplied to me, then these difficultiesmust be met at all costs.    11.   In  conclusion, I would remark that  I had the greatly appreciatedopportunity  of discussing the whole scheme actually on the spot with Sir samuel hoare, First Lord of the Admiralty, when he visited Gibraltar last month.                                       I have, &amp;c.                             (Signed)      C. H.  HARINGTON,                                                    General and Governor.
    6.  With regard to paragraph 5 of  Secretary of State&apos;s despatch dated the1st October,  1936, it is assumed that,- in any case, this encroachment will  not extend further East  than the main road to Spain.    The factors involved are mainly administrative, namely, the provision of newaccommodation for troops now quartered in this area.    For the safety of the Fortress, it is certain that at least the present numberof troops must be quartered somewhere close to the boundary fence.   Increasednumbers may well be required to safeguard the new construction on the aerodromefrom sabotage.  It is difficult to suggest  any alternative site for their barrackswhich  would not curtail  seriously  most military and  recreational  training facilities on the remainder of the North Front.    Fortress  Headquarters,           Gibraltar, October 13,1936.     Rear-Admiral-in-Charge, Gibraltar, to the Secretary of the Admiralty.(Secret.)(No. 218/4806.)                                           October 29, 1936.     PROPOSED establishment of  an aerodrome  on  land  to  be reclaimed  in commercial Harbour.     Be pleased to inform Their Lordships that  the  project of establishing an aerodrome on  land to be reclaimed in Commercial Harbour has been the subjectof investigation at Gibraltar.  This matter was first  mooted last spring.  If an aerodrome at  Gibraltar  is considered necessary  for  Imperial  reasons, the siteproposed in  the secret J.D.C.  Paper on this subject, which was shown to me a fewdays ago by his Excellency the Governor, is the only possible one.  The reclamationwould not be a difficult operation and the loss of  anchorage space in the shallowarea to be covered by the actual aerodrome is  not,  in my opinion,  of greatimportance from a naval point of view.  It is now only used by small  craft.     2.  This project being the subject of a J.D.C. Paper, it must be presumed that Their Lordships have considered it and have  acquiesced in  the proposal now put  forward.   It  does seem, however,  that some local  aspects of  the possible repercussions may have escaped investigation and notice,  and  so the followingremarks on the matter are submitted :      (a)  Earlier C.I.D.  Papers refer to Gibraltar as a Naval Base and anchorage;          route giving port; and Contraband Control base; it was also in the          late  war,  and  undoubtedly  will  be  again,   an important convoy          assembly port.     (b)  It is precisely these aspects of its usefulness which may be most adversely          affected  by  the  changed  conditions resulting from  any  strict          delimitation of territorial waters in the Bay.     (c) It is clearly foreseen in  the latest J.D.C. Report that any reference to the          International Court  at The Hague of our rights in the Neutral ground          and in the waters of the  Bay must surely  result in  a  decision which          will seriously limit the area under British  jurisdiction.    (d)  To gain an aerodrome we are risking the  loss  of rights over much of the          North end of the Bay where we now exercise control.    (e) Existing orders and draft proclamations  to be issued by His Excellency          the Governor in time of war claim the port of Gibraltar  to comprise          an area between a  line drawn South True from Roccadillo Tower and          a line drawn West  True from Europa Point.   Actually even this          large area was sometimes found inadequate in the last war when large          convoys were at anchor.    (/) The  most  valuable part of this  area for anchorage  purposes is  the          Northern portion,  where the water is  of moderate depth; and more          shelter is obtained; and it is precisely this part of the Bay over which          we may lose control.
   (g)  In the plan enclosed with the J.D.C. Report red pecked lines show some          possible delimitations of British and Spanish territorial waters that          may be expected to result  from a decision of  The Hague Court.   If          these are produced Westwards it will be seen that they will award to          Spain much of the present commercial anchorage.   (A)  The Spain of the future is likely to be a very different one to the one we          have  all been used to.  It is highly  probable that it will be taken out          of its almost mediaeval life and outlook and  that the famous  motto          &quot; Manana  &quot; will largely disappear.   It may be argued that it is not          possible to change the nature of a  nation in a short  time, but could          anyone have foreseen that the Italy of to-day would have emerged out          of the Italy of pre-war days and Caporetto?  In addition to this, it is          most  likely that Spanish policy will be largely  influenced by Italy and          Germany.    (i)  It cannot be assumed that  Spain would consent to the use of  her          territorial  waters  as  an  anchorage for British Convoys, or  for          purposes of the Contraband Control Service  in a war  in which she          was a neutral.   (j)  It follows therefore that the establishment of this aerodrome may lead to          a  grave diminution  of the  value  of   Gibraltar for  the  purposes          mentioned  above.
