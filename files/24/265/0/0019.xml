SECRET.                                                    COPY NO. ff3C.P.299(36)                                 CABINET.               Location of proposed Cordite  Factory at Gretna.                    Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.   The recommendation to establish a cordite factory at Gretna in preference to Bishopton is based,  inter alia,  on the  saving of time and money (including capital outlay and recurring expenditure), the moreabundant water supply and the facilities for expansion.   These are mattersupon which I am not in a position to offer expert criticism,   I appreciatefully the importance of the time factor;  but there are  considerations affecting the supply of labour for erecting  the factory  and the provisionof housing for those who are to work in it,  which lead me to wonder whetherthe balance of advantage in this matter lies so clearly  as is suggestedwith the Gretna site.   These considerations are referred to later in thismemorandum;  but before dealing with them I  propose to examine some of theother arguments which have been put forward  in favour of Gretna.2.   These arguments are briefly that     (a) there is a labour shortage at Glasgow and  consequently the         erection of the factory at Bishopton would not  assist the         Glasgow area;     (b) there would be a shortage of skilled labour  to  build the         necessary factory at Gretna but once the factory was built,         unskilled labour would be required  which should be obtainable         at Gretna:     (c) the erection of an explosives factory is of  little value  to a         distressed area as it can only be worked at  part time for a         period of years until the necessary stocks are  accumulated, and         would then have to close down.
3.   I venture to suggest that these arguments to some extent cancel eachother out, as is shown, by the following facts as to the labour supply ineach area.     Bishopton is easily accessible with good road or ferry communications,from the following centres:  Glasgow, Renfrew, Paisley, Johnstone, PortGlasgow, Greenock,  Clydebahk and Dumbarton.   The total number of adult malepersons registering at Employment Exchanges in these areas at21st September,  1936 was 64,515, of whom 44,270 were classified as labourers.     Gretna,  on the other hand,  occupies a more isolated position, beingsome ten miles from Carlisle and eight miles from Annan.   Its labour requirements are met principally by the Annan Employment Exchange and to a smaller extent by Longtovn (4 miles away);  the total number of adult malepersons registering at these two offices at the same date was 444 of whom262 were classified as labourers.4.   As regards the alleged labour shortage at Glasgow, it is clear fromthe figures I have given there is no general shortage.   There is undoubtedly a shortage of skilled building operatives (but this is nomerely local phenomenon) and possibly of precision workers in engineering.But these are difficulties which would be much more acute at Gretna, wherethere is neither housing nor industries to attract skilled men.  The men required for an explosives factory are irainly process workers, recruitedlargely from among labourers, together with a large proportion of menaccustomed to heavy labouring and there is an ample supply of men of this type within easy reach of the Bishopton area.   There is certainly noconsiderable body of such men at present at Gretna and the location of theworks there will undoubtedly involve importation from other areas, if as islikely, the numbers required will be in excess of the very small surplus atpresent available in that area.    Moreover, I observe that the opinion has been expressed that this labour would be drawn from England ratherthan Scotland, and to that extent the relief afforded to the depressed areas of Scotland would be diminished.
 5,   I understand that there is a considerable number of derelict buildings at Gretna.   These will presumably have to &quot;be cleared away, and new premises built.   In addition housing will &quot;be required for  the men brought in from other areas.   All this will take time, besides creating a problem in the supply of building labour, which at -periods of exceptional activity in the industry, as at present, is in short supply and is reluctant to go to areas so isolated as G-retna.     At Bishopton on the other hand, fewer houses would be required and there would be less difficulty in obtaining such building labour as would be necessary for factory or other buildings, in view  of the accessibility of the site. 6.   I turn now to the argument that an explosives factory is of little value to a depressed area^ owing to the part-time employment it affords until it closes down upon accumulation of -die necessary stocks.     I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of this description of the activity of an explosives factory;  I do, on the other hand, most seriously doubt whether,  depressed areas apart, we are justified in putting^such a factory down in an area into which it will be necessary to import practically all the labour required,  and provide them with houses and public services, instead of establishing it in an area where there are ample reserves of at any rate a large proportion of the labour required, and the housing and public services to a great and possibly sufficient extent already exist. 7.   When to the foregoing considerations is added -the clamant need for providing work,  even if it lasts only for a period of years, in the depressed areas,  I think we should be rightly censured if we spent  4,000,000 or moreupon the construction of a factory - which in itself will ^ive a large amount of employment - in an area like Gretna, unless the arguments in favour of such a course are far stronger than those which have yet been advanced.    In my viewbearing in mind our frequent protestations of our determination to lead the way in reviving industry in the Special and depressed areas,  the social andpolitical arguments are almost overwhelmingly in favour of the Bishopton site, and I suggest that the economic arguments tend strongly in the same direction.
