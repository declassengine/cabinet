At their Meeting on June 10th, 1936, (Cabinet 41 (36)Conclusion 8), the Cabinet had before then a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (CP. 148 (36)) covering the Reportof the Committee on Electricity Distribution.under the Chair-manship of Sir Harry McGowan.                                 ,     The Cabinet agreed-          That the Minister cf Transport should &quot;be          authorised to publish the Report of the          Committee cn electricity Distribution0     On June 25th, 1936, the present Committee was appointedby the Cabinet to examine and report on  the conclusions andrecommendations contained in the McGowan Report (Cabinet 46(36) Conclusion 2),2,   We have examined the principal proposals contained in tneReport of the McGowan Committee (CP. 148 (36)), and are agreedthat legislation to give effect to them  is desirable.   We have carried our investigations to a point at which it is possibleto formulate recommendations, and, after examining the alterna-tives, we are prepared to accept the general conclusions of theMcGowan Report.   These were stated by them as followsj-          &quot;The essential features of any scheme of           re-organisation must be:               (a) a substantial reduction in the present                   number of undertakings by the substitution                   where appropriate of larger and more                   economic unitsj                              -1-SECRET.S.E.238  (36) .
     (b) the prevention of the splitting up of         comprehensive undertakings in consequence         of the exercise of rights of purchase by         individual local authorities!     (c) the elimination of duplicate powers         wherever they exist in the same area.Adequate grounds do not exist for an immediate and complete re-organisation on a regional basis under public control by the setting up of regional boardswhich would buy out all existing undertakings.Re-organisation should be based on tne retentionand utilisation, where possible, of the larger andcore efficient of the existing undertakings andthe absorption by such undertakings &apos; of tne. smaller&apos;or less efficient undertakings.Any attempt to carry through a scheme of re-organiSt.:tion on a voluntary basis is bound to fail and legislation must confer definite and adequate compulsory powers.The schemes of re-organisation should make provisionfor the possibility of ultimate public ownership ofall undertakingss including those not at presentsubject to purchase by the local authorities/&apos;                     (McGowan Report, page&apos;81).3.   we have had worked out for us the heads of a craft Bill,and nave satisfied ourselves that a practicable measure can beproduced on the above lines which will secure the improvementsrecommended by the McGow&amp;n ReA ort.4.   We are further of opinion that a L. roinise of such legislation should, if possible, find a place in the King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of the new Cession, and that ete:.s should be taken to draft the necessary Bill with a view to its introduction later in the Session if time permits.5,   We propose to submit shortly a full Report upon the outlineswhich we think the Bill should, follow.   We suggest that theCabinet Committee be kept in being in oreer that in due course it may examine the detailed provisions of the measure, prior tosubmission to the Cabinet.
0o6.   To sum up,  we recommend to the cabinet-          (i) The acceptance of the general conclusions              of the McGowari Report;         (ii) The promise of legislation on tne lines of              that Report in the forthcoming KingVs Speech              on the Opening of Parliament 5        (iii) That the Committee be kept in being in order              to examine the detailed provisions of a Bill,              which might,  if time permit;., be introduced              later in the  Session.Signed on behalf of the Committee       HALIFAX              chapter i man.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.I.
