Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 332 (36).                                CABINET.POSITION OF BELGIUM AND THE PROPOSED FIVE-POWER                          CONFERENCE.        Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues as annexes to this memorandum a despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at  Brussels recording my conversations on the27th and 28th  November  with the Belgian  Prime Minister  (Annex A) and atelegram from Sir E. Ovey giving the  text of the relevanL^oaitioiTs of M. vanZeeland&apos;s statement in the Belgian Parliament on the 2nd December respectingBelgium&apos;s position in relation to the negotiations  for the proposed Five-PowerTreaty.  Much of the  information  contained in these two reports was alreadyknown to us, but in  the light of it and of earlier reports it  will be convenientonce more to state briefly the position of the Belgian Government:     (a) Belgium, in accordance with her undertaking given in London in March,          adheres provisionally  to her obligations under the  Treaty of Locarno          of 1925, but she &apos;&apos; wishes the new agreement at which we are aiming          to be concluded as quickly as possible.&quot;  Her existing obligations in          this matter  &apos;&apos;  must not be  allowed to crystallise  into  permanent          obligations and the provisional period could not last much longer.&quot;    (b) Belgium will not give guarantees to other States  in any new treaty, but          she will take defensive measures  to prevent Belgian  territory being-          used  by  an  aggressor  State as  a  passage  or base  of operations.          (N.B. It is still not absolutely clear that this refers also to the air.)    (c) Belgium will continue her membership of the League of  Nations  and          her fidelity  to her obligations under  the Covenant, though of those          obligations,  and particularly of article 16,  Belgium &quot;will accept no          other interpretation than that which she thinks proper to give as a          sovereign  State.&quot;   She cannot, for  example,  allow the question of          the passage of  troops  across her territory under paragraph  3 of          article 16 of the Covenant to be decided over her head by France or          some other outside body.    (d) M.  van  Zeeland did not,  in  my  conversation with  him, exclude the          possibility of Belgium undertaking  under  the proposed new treaty          to furnish France  and Great Britain with information designed to&apos;          assure them of the efficacy  of her  defences,  but he stipulated that          Belgium must be free  to give similar information  to Germany if the          latter required  it.   In the  Belgian Parliament he added that  &quot; we          require a  military system which  shall not permanently be directed          against anyone  nor tied  up in a permanent fashion with the military          conceptions of anyone else.&quot;  (N.B. This does not suggest that the          Belgian Government are likely readily to communicate their defence          plans to the French Government as desired by the latter.)    (e) As the Belgian Government expect  the negotiations for the new Western          Treaty to break down on the question of the safeguarding of France&apos;s          treaty relations with  Russia, M. van Zeeland suggested to me that      [14243] &apos;                                                   B
           an  attempt might then be made to negotiate a  treaty under  which           Germany,  Great Britain, France,  and possibly also Italy,  would           guarantee  Belgium&apos;s independence and  integrity, and possibly that           of the Netherlands;  and he seemed to suggest that this treaty might           be followed by a second treaty between Britain and France, or between           Britain.  France and  Germany,  guaranteeing   the  German-French           frontier as it was guaranteed under the Treaty of Locarno; Belgium           would not be a party to this second treaty..   1  2.   In passing  I  should like to  deal &quot;first with M.  Van Zeeland&apos;s desire to conclude the provisional  period. is:, the continuance of the obligations of the existing  Treaty  of  Locarno, as speedily as  possible.   With regard  to  this,  I propose to ash him to await the conclusion of the exchanges of views  at present proceeding between  the  five Locarno Powers before  calling  in question the duration of the  provisional period,  and even  then to  make  no definite move without reference to me.     3.   Meanwhile, we must face the  fact that the present exchange of views may demonstrate sooner rather than later that no agreement is possible on the basis of the old Locarno Treaty. We had better therefore consider what courses will be open to us in the case  of such a breakdown.   Three courses  have been suggested at different times :      (a)  The course  outlined in the  Letters which  His Majesty&apos;s  Government           addressed to the French and Belgian Governments on the 1st  April           last (Annex C).     (b)  The course  now  proposed  by M.  van  Zeeland, as  explained  in           paragraph  1 (e).     (c) A system whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government would, instead of entering           into any  agreements with other Powers, merely state  by means of  a           declaration made in  the most formal manner  that it is a vital British           interest that the independence and integrity of Belgium (and possibly           also the Netherlands) should be  maintained, and that the Franco-           German frontier should not be violated, and that they intend therefore           to intervene whenever they think it necessary in order to ensure the           respect of this vital interest.     4.   Under the letters  of the 1st  April we undertook, should  &apos;&apos; the effort of conciliation &quot;  (based on a Western treaty of mutual assistance) fail, to consider with France and  Belgium the situation thus created, to come to the assistance ofthe two countries in  respect of any measures  jointly  decided upon, to take all practicable measures for assuring their security against unprovoked aggression,and to establish contacts between the General Staffs.  France undertook to take similar action,  but Belgium did not reply to our letter.  In view of the attitudenow developed by the Belgian Government,  it is  impossible to carry out thesepromises in the form of a mutual guarantee treaty between  the three Powers, as was evidently contemplated : but the  essence of these promises could be kept by adopting courses  (b) or (c) as will be shown by the following paragraphs.     5.   At first  sight M.  van Zeeland&apos;s proposal holds  certain attractions.  if germany shows a modicum of goodwill it ought to be possible for her to become  a party to the Belgian  Guarantee Treaty  and  thus to continue to co-operate withthe other Western Powers in  the maintenance of  the  status quo  in western europe.   Also  it probably represents the greatest measure of co-operation thatwe can  in present circumstances hope to extract from  Belgium, and there  is thedanger  that, unless we accept the offer now,  it may  be withdrawn and Belgium,perhaps under  another Prime Minister than M. van Zeeland, may gradually bedrawn into the. German orbit.   On the other hand, the proposed Belgian Treatyhas an  unpleasant resemblance  to the fateful.,&quot; neutralisation &quot;  treaty of 1839,and although M.  van Zeeland assures us that Belgium has  no wish to return toher pre-war &quot;neutrality&quot;  and has  every  intention of  continuing to fulfil  herLeague obligations, nevertheless, the  very character of the  treaty will certainlystrengthen the  present Belgian  inclination to resist.any effort by Great Britainor France to make their guarantee effective by assuring themselves that Belgiumis contributing effectively to her  own defence.  Still less will Belgium under sucha treaty be inclined to co-operate in any way with Great Britain or France in thegeneral defence of the territorial status quo of Western Europe.  But  even more
 important than these considerations is the fact that the French Government can and would claim that under our letter of the 1st April she could not be asked to accept M. van Zeelancls treaty, unless adequate provision were made at the same time to secure to France the guarantee which she at present  receives from Great Britain.  This could only be done by means of a separate xAnglo-French treaty, which, unless Germany could be induced to join it, would have all the appearance of an Anglo-French alliance against Germany.   It would be difficult to induce Italy  to join such a treaty unless Germany did so too.  As for Germany, all her objections which, presumably, will have rendered impossible a new Locarno Treaty -France&apos;s Eastern commitments, League of Nations control, a French guarantee to Great Britain, &amp;c-would be equally present when it came to formulating this more  limited  treaty.  If it had been impossible to meet Germany&apos;s objections in the case of the proposed Five-Power Treaty, this difficulty would be in no  sense reduced by the fact that Belgium was now excluded from the scope  of this  more limited treaty.     6.  There remains the declaratory method.   If  His Majesty&apos;s Government made  a declaration as outlined in paragraph 3  (c)  it would, of course, be essential that France should make  a similar  declaration guaranteeing this  country and Belgium  (and, possibly, the  Netherlands).   The advantage of the  declaratory method is that it  leaves the door open to future detailed agreements with other Powers if and when necessary,  while  it relieves His Majesty&apos;s Government of having to take an early decision in favour of an Anglo-French  treaty.  At the same time this system would enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to fulfil in  their essentials the promises they made  to France in the -letter of the 1st April, and at the same  time  it would give  His Majesty&apos;s Government  and France  a  locus standi, if they desired it,  for pressing Belgium for assurances  regarding the efficacy of her  defences  and for a measure of co-operation in  the common defence of the status quo in-Western Europe.     7.  I do  not  wish  to  suggest  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government should here and now make their choice between these two courses.  It is difficult at the present moment to foresee how matters are going to develop,  and I  would wish to keep my hands free until I can  form a more accurate estimate  than is possible at present of the prospects of the new &quot;Locarno&quot; treaty, and  of the causes which are  likely to  render it impossible for such  a treaty to  materialise in present conditions.   / would -propose, therefore, to warn M. van  Zeeland that I see serious difficulties in the way  of his new plan, and that I would be grateful if he would therefore abstain from putting it forward, even unofficially,  until the situation has further developed.  I would add, however, to M. van Zeeland that I saw  considerable advantage in his carrying out the suggestion  he  made to me, of finding some early excuse for an unofficial visit to Paris for  conversation  with tlie French Government.     8.  Superimposed upon this problem of future policy is  the more immediate question which has been created by the action  of the Belgian  Government in withholding in any future treaty  the  guarantee which Belgium has,  hitherto, given  to France.  The  French Government are pressing for consultation  with His Majesty&apos;s Government in order to settle what measure of co-operation should still be required of Belgium in the absence of Belgium&apos;s former guarantee.  This question arises primarily in connexion with the exchange of views now: proceeding regarding a new &quot;Locarno&quot; treaty, but it will subsist in the case where,  as a result  of such  &quot;Locarno&quot; treaty failing to materialise, His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment are  called upon to adopt any of the other courses which I  have examined in this paper.  An early decision  is necessary, as the French Government are pressing to know our views on the  subject.    9.  The position is as  follows :  Since the war we have always proceeded on- the assumption that Belgium should co-operate as a full and active  collaborator in the mutual defence of &quot;the &quot;territorial statics qyo in -Western -Europe.-  This. assumption derived from the conviction that the previous policy of &quot;Belgium&apos;s neutralisation,  which had existed from 1839-1914, had failed  lamentably when put to the test in the latter year.  This policy  of full co:operatibinwhs not  only formally embodied in the  Treaty of  Locarno,  but it forms  the basis on which His majesty&apos;s government are at present conducting their negotiations for a new- Western Pact, of Mutual Guarantee.     &quot;                    :   y-        -a4ih -  .[14243j  &apos;              V&quot;&apos; ;.w,-          31 - .&quot;&apos;-i I: W^^&amp;^lSui
     10.   Its object is to try to make  our guarantee effective by enlisting theco-operation of Belgium in the  defence of the territorial status qve of Western Europe and ensuring that she  contributes effectively to her own defence. Inpursuance of this policy, the French wish to obtain a positive undertaking fromthe Belgian Government that Belgium will, under paragraph 3 of Article 16 ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations (Annex D) give passage over her territory to a France acting  against Germany when declared to be an aggressor; that theBelgian Government will communicate their defence plans to the French Govern-ment; and that  positions  will  be prepared  in Belgian  territory which french troops can take up  before Germany enters  it.   Is it desirable that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should support the French in these demands and that  the BelgianGovernment should, in addition, be called upon to define their undertaking to forbid access to Belgian territory, so as to make it clear  that they will resist notonly a violation by the German Army of Belgian territory, but also of Belgian airby German aircraft?     11.   The main argument in favour of the policy  of co-operation seems to bethat it is a great risk to be committed to  a  guarantee of Belgian independence and integrity without receiving  in return any assurances from Belgium as to her future plans and policy under  the new Treaty.  The giving of a guarantee to belgium is a much more serious matter now than when the Treaty of Locarno wasnegotiated in 1925.  At that time the German Army was confined  within thelimits of  the Treaty of Versailles and the  Rhineland  was demilitarised.  Yet inthose days we enjoyed the  indirect benefit  of the guarantee which Belgium  gaveto France.  That guarantee is now to go and, as things stand at present, we shall,after the  expiry of  the present provisional period, be left only with some generalstatements of good intentions by the Belgian  Prime  Minister, who  may be outof power  and disowned to-morrow.   It is comprehensible that the  French willnot be satisfied with such a situation, and  will press for  its improvement.     12.   The alternative policy  is to try to produce a situation in which we andthe French can base our plans on the assumption that Germany will not violateBelgian territory or air;  and which will ensure the  greatest possible chance ofBelgium keeping out of any war.  To judge from recent reports submitted bythe Chiefs of Staff, I gather that they would propose the complete abandonment of the policy of co-operation with Belgium,  and its replacement by a policy ofwhat they described as Belgian &quot; neutrality,&quot; but which  would be more correctlydesignated as &quot; non-belligerency.&quot;  Not only do they  deprecate any co-operationbetween Belgium on the one side and  France and Great Britain on the other forthe better defence of Belgium&apos;s  independence and integrity;  they would go  even further and restore in its entirety the pre-war system  whereby Belgium  as a&quot; neutralised State  &quot; was forbidden to undertake any commitments or obligations which might lead her to become  a belligerent in certain circumstances.  For thispurpose it would seem that they would welcome action whereby Belgium wouldbe formally released from those obligations Avhich are  binding upon her  in virtueof Article 16 of the Covenant.     13.   In support of this view it might, I  suppose,  be  argued that  if Belgiumis &quot; neutral &quot; (or non-belligerent), the violation of Belgian territory by germany could appear to the world in no  other light than wanton  aggression.   Be that asit may, world indignation, however intense, would not  drive the German army outof Belgium in a future war any  more than  it did in 1914.  It might perhaps alsobe said that if Belgium were &quot; neutral &quot; (or non-belligerent), there would be lesschance of the violation of  her territory by Germany  than in 1914,  because theBelgian defences  are stronger  than then. But even  if  that is the case, would notthe adoption by Belgium of such a position diminish the pressure which could bebrought upon her by France and  this country to maintain  adequate.defences;  and what guarantee should we have that, as the years passed, those defences would not become inadequate  and increasingly inadequate 1   Our leverage might, in fact,vanish at  any time,  and thus would disappear one of the arguments on which therecommendation of the Chiefs of Staff is founded. Again, it might be urged that new deterrents to German aggression have been created by the proposed extensionof the Maginot line  to the sea and the fact that it is now known that Britain will certainly fight for the security of Belgium.  But the extended Maginot line is stillonly in process of construction; and, as regards the German view of the certainty
of British intervention, reference may be made to a telegram from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Berlin of the 25th November.  It is there stated that the informa-tion of the higher Nazi circles is that the British public  will not fight again for france or Belgium for at least  a generation, and that the fighting spirit is sodormant in England that only an attack on the Empire would awaken it.     14.  In the  light of these  observations some doubt is legitimate  whetherthe German General Staff may not still hold that Belgium is the easiest line of advance  on Paris and the Channel ports; and  in this connexion  it  is perhapslegitimate to point out that, as compared  with 1914, the  vulnerability of  theUnited Kingdom  and,  therefore,  presumably,  the attractiveness of  any  directroute to  the United Kingdom, has been increased by the development of the airweapon.  In fact, everything seems to confirm the earlier view of  the Chiefs ofStaff that the  chances  of Belgian  &quot; neutrality &quot; being maintained throughout a western European war are remote. I would go  further and say that  they are soremote as to be almost negligible.  Nevertheless, in their latest reports the Chiefsof Staff would  appear  to recommend that our policy and our strategy should bebased entirely on  this admittedly remote possibility.     15.  To me this seems to constitute a risk which is altogether  too great andwhich  we ought not to be invited to run  until it is absolutely  unavoidable.   Inother words, the arguments which have been advanced so far have  not convincedme that  it is  either desirable or  safe to alter  the policy  of co-operation withBelgium which France, and  to  a less extent His Majesty&apos;s Government, have followed since the war.     16.  Moreover, by recommending for Belgium a policy of non-co-operationwe should be going further than M. van Zeeland, who, to judge from his conversa-tions, is  prepared for some measure of co-operation.  In any case, he has  neversuggested that  Belgium should be free from her obligations under Article  16 ofthe Covenant.  All that he  has stipulated is  that Belgium should  be  free to interpret them  herself.  If now Belgium were, for our purposes, relieved of these obligations, other States might well desire the same advantages for their purposes;and the disintegration of the  League in its present form would thus have receiveda  considerable  impulsion at  our hands.  On the other  hand,  by  showing  the belgians that  we are  in  favour of   some  measure of  co-operation, we  shallstrengthen the hands of those Belgians who are  anxious to co-operate with us in defence of Belgian territory and shall  correspondingly weaken those who, in the face of the growing menace of Germany, are ready to submit to German influence and, if need be, German dictation.    17.  In principle therefore  I adhere to  a policy of co-operation between theUnited Kingdom, France and Belgium.   But since in practice it is clear that belgium  is not likely  to go beyond the attitude which M. van Zeeland has now taken up towards Article 16 of the Covenant, and towards the communication of defence plans,  I should propose to take the following  line in discussing withthe French and Belgian Governments  the points which the French have raised with me in connection with the Belgian decision to give no guarantee under theproposed new &quot; Locarno &quot; Treaty :     (1) The French  Government  having  raised the  question of  Belgium&apos;^responsibilities  under  paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Covenant  in  the matterof the passage  of  troops across Belgian territory, I would propose to advise themto agree with M.  van Zeeland to accept as the best solution that can be obtained in the  circumstances the assurance which he is apparently ready to (jive, to  theeffect that he recognises Belgium&apos;s obligations under paragraph 3 of Article 16,provided that Belgium is alone judge of the circumstances when, and extent towhich,  she shall carry  out these obligations.    (2) I should ask the Belgian Government (again either alone or jointly withthe French) to  define their undertaking to forbid access to their territory,  so asto mean that they will resist not  only a violation by the German army  of Belgian territory, but also of Belgian air by German aircraft.   This seems particularly important for us.    (3) I should urge the Belgian Government to do all  they can to remove  thepresent uncertainty as regards  their  attitude  towards  co-operation with  theFrench, and impress upon them the importance that both we and the French attach,       [14243]       &apos;                                              b 3
 to being assured at regular intervals that Belgium is continuing to maintain her defences in such a state of efficiency as really to be able to carry out her under- taking not to grant access to her territory or allow it to serve as a passage or base for operations for German military or aeronautical forces.  A gain this seems of vital importance  to us; and  its reasonableness has been admitted  by M.  van Zeeland.     (4) In discussing  with the French  the question of urging the Belgians to define the extent to which  they are prepared to  co-operate with France, I should make it clear that, although I  sympathise with the desire of the French to remove the  present  uncertainty,  I am  not  prepared  to  take  part  in  any  detailed discussions  with regard to the actual French proposals (i.e., communication of defence plans, and. the preparation of positions in Belgian territory  for French troops), since His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves do not wish  to  participate in such measures of co-operation.   The latter desideratum I am satisfied that the Belgian Government would not in any circumstances grant.     Foreign Office, December  5, 1936.ANNEX A.                      Mr. Eden to Sir E. Ovey [Brussels). (No. 608.) Sir,                                      Foreign Office, November 30, 1936.     THE  Belgian Prime  Minister took the opportunity of his recent visit to! London to explain to me the present attitude of the Belgian Government as a result of the situation created by the withdrawal  by Belgium of the guarantee she has hitherto given to France.     M. van Zeeland stressed  the  fact  that he  had  never used  the word &quot;neutrality&quot;  in  describing Belgium&apos;s new position, and insisted  that he had no wish to see Belgium  return  to  the position of a  neutralised  State  as before 1914.   On the contrary,  he stated definitely  that the  Belgian  Government considered themselves bound by all their existing obligations,  that is to say,  by the Covenant of the League and by the arrangement of the 19th March, which kept alive the conditions of the Locarno Treaty as between Great Britain, France and Belgium.     As regards the  Covenant,  M.  van  Zeeland did not deny that in certain circumstances Belgium was bound by paragraph 3 of article  16 as regards the passage of troops across her territory.. The point, however, he did  insist upon was that Belgium should  in every  case be the judge as to when and whether these circumstances had  arisen;  he could  not  allow  this  question to be decided over the head of Belgium by France or by any outside body.     As regards Belgium&apos;s obligations under the arrangement of the 19th March, M. van  Zeeland  stressed the  fact  that  these obligations  were  clearly of  a provisional character.   They clearly must  not be  allowed  to  crystallise into permanent obligations, and he warned me that  he considered that the provisional period could not last much longer in view of the decreasing prospects  of a new Locarno.   In case, therefore, of  the present  negotiations  for a new Locarno having to be abandoned, he had been thinking over what could best take the place of this provisional regime, and he now proposed the following  plan :      It was probable that the negotiations  for a new Locarno would suffer ship-wreck on the rock  of France&apos;s obligations in the East. It was  indeed these same obligations which  made it  difficult  for Belgium to assume commitments vis-a-vis-of France.  On the other hand, there, was  general  agreement between all the parties that Belgium&apos;s independence and integrity ought to be guaranteed, and he suggested that  a new treaty might be constructed round this nucleus, that is to say, that Germany, Great Britain, France,  Belgium, and  possibly also Italy,should each aeree to  guarantee  Belgium&apos;s  independence and integrity.  M. van Zeeland considered, moreover, that the Netherlands might be ready to enter into such a treaty on the  same terms as Belgium.  M. van Zeeland did not exclude
the possibility  in such a  treaty of Belgium  furnishing information to Franceand Great Britain  to assure them of  the continued efficacy  of  Belgium&apos;s  own-defences, but he stipulated that Belgium must be free to give similar information to Germany  if the latter required it,  as Belgium could  not associate herselfexclusively with any particular Powers.    M. van Zeeland seemed to suggest that this Belgian guarantee system wouldbe accompanied by an Anglo-French or possibly an Anglo-French-German treaty to guarantee  the German-French frontier in the same way as  it was guaranteedunder the Treaty of Locarno,  but Belgium would definitely not be a party to this second treaty.    M. van Zeeland said he  had been very disappointed  and surprised at the critical attitude which the French bad taken up as regards the  King of the belgians&apos;  speech.   It was pointed  out  to him that it was  only natural that theFrench should be upset at being suddenly deprived of Belgiunfs guarantee afterthe assurances of mutual  assistance which had been exchanged last March, andthat they should be anxious to see whether they could not save out of the wreckagefor the future some measure  of  technical co-operation  between France  andBelgium.  To this M. van Zeeland  replied that he was quite willing, and indeedintended, to initiate further conversations shortly  with French Ministers with aview to reassuring them of BelgiunTs policy and intentions.                                                 I am, &amp;c.                                                     ANTHONY EDEN.ANNEX B.:              Sir E. Ovey to Mr. Eden. (Received December 3.)(Telegraphic.)  En clair.                         Bmssels, December 3, 1936.    FOLLOWING is the text of M. van  Zeeland&apos;s remarks in regard to theTreaty of Locarno and the League :-          &apos;&apos; I must here remind you that the conclusion of the Pact  of Locarno was    a tremendous step forward.  The same consideration of independence and    of care for the  preservation of equilibrium  among  our neighbours which    animates  us at the moment went toward the making of it.  At Locarno    former enemies found themselves placed on a footing of equality, and our    country retained the position wherein it believed that it con Id  most effectively    play its role of peacemaker in the west.   I feel that I can say here and now    that if  we were to find ourselves again in the same circumstances which    prevailed  at the period when the Treaty of Locarno was signed, in the light    of everything which we have  since seen, we  would have to clo again that    which we  have done.   But, in reality, circumstances have been modified; the    conceptions which dictated the Treaty of Locarno remain intact, but they    must be applied to  a situation which  has been profoundly  changed.  The    reoccupation of the Rhineland, German rearmament, the weakening of the    League  of Nations,  involve the multiplication of  pacts  and the confusion    which flows from them, all these elements oblige us to adapt  our attitude to    the new circumstances.  Hence the clear-cut position  which the Government    has taken up and which found its expression in the Royal speech.         &quot; Gentlemen, somebody has dared  in this House to try to establish a    distinction (I know not how) between the attitude of the Government and    the King&apos;s speech.  But has the fact been lost sight of that the publication    of the King&apos;s speech  is a declaration of the Government?  We live under a    parliamentary regime, a regime of constitutional monarchy.   The King acts    through the intermediary  of his Ministers, and it is the Government who    bear the responsibility, who endorse, who apply and who make their own    the policy so magnificently set out in the Royal speech.&quot; (Applause  from    the Government side.)         &quot; However, I would not, I think, be committing any breach of discretion    when I  say that when at  that historical council His Majesty made to his    Ministers   the  communication  contained  in  that  famous speech  the
 spontaneous reaction to it was such that one member of the Cabinet straight away declared : &apos; There  is not one word of this speech to which we  cannot subscribe  unreservedly.&apos;   And,  Gentlemen,   to  this  speech, which  has become  through publication a  declaration  of  the  Government, no one has the  right  to  give  more  or less  fantastic  or  more  or less  imaginary interpretations. No one has the right to cut it into pieces nor keep  that part of it which pleases him and to throw away the rest. The declaration, which is a great declaration, constitutes an  entity which must be taken as such. It demonstrates in a  marvellous  fashion a sacred and  indestructible bond which unites  in one single conception the views on foreign policy--and the views on military  policy which are expressed therein.  And I do not  under- stand how  anybody  can dare to invoke the Royal speech and be  governed in military affairs by any principle other than those which have  animated the King and his  Government, in other words the vote on military defence which is submitted to you.&quot; Speaking on a policy of  independence M. van Zeeland went on :      &quot; Independence  does not mean an absurd  pretension towards  isolation, still less a dangerous and blind misappreciation of our duties. On the contrary, we mean to carry out our duties  and, as a first step, to  put ourselves in a position the better to fulfil them.  Small countries, more than anyone else, should  be careful scrupulously to  respect and, in full,  to apply all  the obligations which they have  undertaken.  We have always done this.   We always   shall,  but this is  yet  a  further reason  for  not  undertaking obligations except with prudence and for only undertaking  such obliga- tions  as we could  fulfil and such as  are entirely precise,  clear and limited; obligations which could not  drag us into adventures with which we have nothing to do.    &apos;&apos; What are our  obligations then ?   To begin with we are members of the League of Nations.  Our  position  vis-a-vis  the  League of Nations has  not  changed; we  remain  convinced  that  the  League  of Nations represents a great effort towards  a better future. We believe in its usefulness, we believe in  its future.  No temporary check, however grave, can modify our policy,  but we have never thought that the League freed  us  (from the obligations) to make the maximum effort in our power  to protect  ourselves. We have always considered it and we will still consider it as a supplementary factor which in certain circumstances could afford us assistance, and I think that we have no right to  reject any element which, in difficult moments, could succour us in  any  degree at all;  Alas, if we look facts  in the face we must to-day recognise that the support brought or promised by  the League and its members is, since the reverse (which it suffered) in the matter of Ethiopia, sensibly reduced.  Thus our  fidelity to the League of Nations urges us to seek to define, while  limiting certainly but at  the  same time making them perfectly clear,  the obligations  which are incumbent upon us by virtue of the Covenant  until these definitions have been given  and particularly as regards article 16. We will accept no other interpretation except that which we think proper to give them as  a  sovereign State.    &quot; The other kind of international  engagements which we have arise from the Treaty of Locarno. They are at the moment provisionally embodied, if I may say so, in the agreements reached in London last March.   Again  and that goes  without saying we are strictly  and rigorously loyal to these engagements,  as to the others;   but these London agreements  have a  provi- sional character; they are to be replaced by others; they could not in any Way be transformed  automatically into definite  agreements,  and  we wish the new agreements towards which we are aiming to be concluded as quickly as possible, by whatever  method  it may be.    &quot;We have clearly defined &quot;what position we would  take in the negotia- tions of these  new accords; we  will  no longer give to France  and Germany the guarantee which is written  down in the accords of  Locarno of 1925 a guarantee  which none the less at  that moment was necessary and  justified. a guarantee which would be to-day inefficacious, dangerous and  unjustifiable.    &quot;As for  saying that we will  not assist in the  organisation of peace in the west, far from it, we have a  great duty to fulfil towards our neighbours,our historical role which derives from our geographical position; it is our duty
ANNEX C.       Mr. Eden to M. Corbin and to Baron de Cartier de Marchienne.Your Excellency,                               Foreign Office, April 1, 1936.    I HAVE  the  honour  to hand  herewith  to  your  Excellency  the lettercontemplated in the Text of  Proposals  drawn  up on  the 19th March by  therepresentatives  of Belgium, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland, and Italy.   Your Excellency will appreciate that the delivery of this letter in no  way implies that  in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom the effort of  conciliation referred to in this letter has failed.  As you  are aware, we have to-day received from  the German Governmentcertain proposals which we have communicated to your Government and  to whichwe are giving our immediate consideration.    Meanwhile, His  Majesty&apos;s Government  are  willing,  in accordance with paragraph III  of the Proposals, to instruct their  General Staffs forthwith  toenter into contact with the Belgian General Staffs, with a view to arranging  thetechnical conditions  in which the obligations referred to in that paragraph shouldbe carried out in case  of unprovoked aggression.    On behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government I have  the honour to state that it isunderstood that this contact between the General Staffs cannot give rise in respectof either Government to any political undertaking, nor to any obligation regardingthe organisation of  national defence.  I shall be glad to have your Excellency&apos;sconfirmation that this is likewise  the understanding of  your Government,    His  Ma.iesty&apos;s  Government  propose that the  conversations between  theGeneral Staffs of the two countries, necessary for  establishing  the  contacts  inquestion, should be begun in London.    I am addressing a similar letter to the French Ambassador.                                                 I have, &amp;c.                                                      ANTHONY EDEN.to the best of our ability to isolate (&apos; immunise!&apos;&apos;) one of the most sensitivepoints in the west, and probably of the world, in  preventing our territoryProm  serving as a starting-point or as a passage or pawn to one or other ofthe great countries which can. and have so often, entered into conflict.   Welessen.by that action in a considerable measure the possibilities and the risks of conflict. Such is the service which all our neighbours have a right to expectfrom  us.  It is our duty to protect them  reciprocally, the ones from  the othersall round us, and with that in view it is necessary that we. should be strongjn,every way, strong enough to be able  to snatch  away iu advance from  ourneighbours every  advantage  which they con Id take  by  a violation of  ourfrontiers, and thus, here we are.brought back to the  military problem.  Tofollow the policy of independence which we have, and in order that this policy should have the results which we desire, that is to say, peace at home as an element of peace in the west and in the world, it is necessary that we make every effort in our power;  and  that is the reason why it is necessary for usto assure for ourselves a cover  for onr  mobilisation, and that is the reason why it is necessary that our army should have resources in men and in richescommensurate with the importance of our country.  But at the same time thatis the reason why it is necessary for our military organisation to correspond with  the conception of our foreign policy, which I  have just outlined.   we require a military system which should not permanently be directed againstanybody, nor tied up in a permanent fashion with the military conceptions ofanyone else.  That is the conception which is at the bottom of the  draft bill which we have submitted to you.&quot;
ANNEX  D.                 Paragraph  3 of Article Id of the  Covenant.    THE Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually supportone another in the financial and economic measures  which are taken under thisArticle, in order to minimise  the loss and inconvenience resulting from the abovemeasures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and thatthey will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to theforces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect thecovenants of the League.
