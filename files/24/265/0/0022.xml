GERMAN AND ITALIAN OBJECTIONS TO A GUARANTEE TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.                     (Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 520.)                                REPORT.    IN our Report* on the preparations for the proposed Five-Power Conferencewe expressed the view that, from the military point of view, we had, on balance,something  definite  to gain  from receiving  guarantees  from France againstGermany,  and from Germany against  France, in any new  Agreement; and wetherefore  recommended  that every endeavour should  be made to obtain suchguarantees.    2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had now asked the Committeeof Imperial Defencet to  consider this question in the light of the objections madeby Germany!, and Italy\ to a guarantee to the United Kingdom, and to advise&apos; whether the military value of such a guarantee is sufficient to render it desirablethat we should make the receipt by ourselves of such a guarantee a sine qua nonin the negotiation of a new Five-Power Pact, or  whether we should be prepared,if necessary, to withdraw our demand  for a guarantee in order to facilitate theconclusion of a Five-Power Pact.&quot;    3.   As the result of  a careful  re-examination of the problem, we  see no military reason to modify the opinion quoted in  paragraph 1 above.    4.   On the other hand, as we have frequently emphasised in the recent past,we consider it vitally important at the present juncture that we should leave nostone unturned to lessen the chances of our being involved  in war, at least until such time as our defensive preparations are much further advanced than  we can expect them to be  for some years.  If, therefore, it is the view of the ForeignOffice that a Five-Power Pact is likely to make a substantial contribution to thecause of peace, we ought to make any reasonable concession that will facilitate its conclusion.    5.  There  is another  point.  We  have  on  more than one occasion  invited attention  to the importance, from a military point of view, of a resumption of our former friendly relations with  Italy.   It  will be  seen  from Sir Eric Drummond&apos;s telegram $  of the 19th October, that Italy is the nation that  has the strongest  objection to our receiving any guarantees.   We  feel that,  apart from          * Paper No. CCS. 511 (also C.I.D. Paper No.  1260-B), paragraphs 12-18.          f See Appendix  A.          $ See Appendix  B.          g See Appendix  C.

the much wider considerations indicated in the preceding paragraph, it would bea mistake to cling to yet another bone of contention with Italy for the sake of theadvantage that we might hope to derive from such guarantees.    6.   We therefore consider that in view of the considerations  in paragraph.pKa.-4and 5 above, it would be wiser, if necessary, to forgo the advantage that is tobe gained by receiving guarantees from France and Germany.          &apos;  .8.O.0                                   (Signed)      ERNLE CHATFIELD.

APPENDIX  A.       Copy of a Letter from the Foreign Office, dated October 21, 1936                             (No. C. 7387/4/18).        ******    You will have seen from the German Memorandum* of the 14th October, andfrom Drummond&apos;s telegram  No. 654* of the 19th October that both the  Germanand Italian Governments seem to object to our proposal to recast the  locarno treaty so as not merely to provide a guarantee from Britain and Italy for France,Belgium and Germany, but guarantees  for those two countries at least so far aswe are concerned from France and  Germany.   It is probable that both powers have taken alarm at  the mention   in the  French  Memorandum of the  30thSeptember (paragraph 5)t of a &quot; guarantee of the territorial status quo as well as of the inviolability  of the  frontiers  of  their  territories  and  dependencies.&quot;Germany may  well be thinking of the  colonial question, and Italy of a Frenchguarantee for Malta.    It is, of course, also possible that both Powers may think  that a Frenchguarantee of the United Kingdom would further solidify the relations  between france and this country.    I enclose a short Memorandum\ setting out the various references,  explicitand implicit, to a French (and German) guarantee to the United Kingdom in thelast three years.    The Foreign Secretary would be grateful if, in view of the objection  made byGermany and  Italy to a  guarantee  to  the  United Kingdom, the Committee ofImperial Defence would now consider whether the military value to this country of such a guarantee is  sufficient to render it desirable  that we should make thereceipt by ourselves of such a guarantee a sine qua non in the negotiation of a newEive-Power Pact, or  whether we should be prepared, if necessary, to with drawour  demand for a guarantee in order to facilitate the conclusion of a Five-PowerPact.                                       .  (Signed)      0. G.  SARGENT.                        ENCLOSURE TO APPENDIX A.                Memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office.    ON the 5th December, 1933  (Berlin telegram  No.  274), \  Sir  E. Phippsreported Herr Hitler as  informing him that he, the  Chancellor, would be glad if England and France made defensive alliances.  In February 1935  came theproposal first elaborated in an Anglo-French meeting in London for an  Air Pactto be entered into by France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Italy  for mutualprotection against air attack.  In a paper for the Cabinet dated the 1st February,Sir J. Simon stated that, &apos;&apos; unlike Locarno,  this proposal provides this country with a definite and immediate  protection against the risk of  air attack.  It,therefore, is not open to the objection raised against Locarno that we are entering into commitments for the benefit of others.  On the contrary, it is directly meetingthe principal preoccupation of British opinion on the subject of danger fromthe air.   On  the  8th February,  1935,  the Chiefs  of  Staff  Sub-Committeejlcommented on the proposed Air Pact.  After pointing out that in most respects the proposed Treaty differed little  from Locarno in that &quot; in actual practice an aggression that brings the air forces into operation under  the proposed Pact will inevitably bring the provisions of the Locarno Treaty into operation, and, in any                 * Reproduced as Appendices B and C to this paper.                 f Full text of this paragraph is reproduced as Appendix D.                 % See Enclosure.                 g Not reproduced.

 event, it is obvious that it is not possible to limit war to one particular arm of the defence forces,&quot; the Chiefs of Staff continued that &quot;  we appreciate the value to us of some definite  guarantee against what may be  a grave menace  in the future.&quot;   Sir M. Hankey, in a memorandum* of the 14th  February, 1935, also noted  the  French  proposal  to  guarantee  the United Kingdom,  but he asked &apos;&apos; whether  any democratic country, and particularly France, can be counted on for more than a  year or two to honour such an engagement,&quot; and he continued that &quot; the  truth is that, if it is to France&apos;s interest to come to our assistance, she can be relied on  to do  so whether there is a treaty  or not.  If it is not  to her interest at the time, she will not do so.&quot;  He also suggested that even if France gave us a guarantee the circumstances in which we were attacked might be such that she would not be able to honour it, and  he expressed some doubt whether, should we  be attacked  as a result of our  refusal to surrender a colony, France would come to our help even with the guarantee in force.  On the 21st February, 1935, t the  Foreign Office made certain  comments,  particularly  upon Sir M. Hankey&apos;s views as described above.   The Foreign Office took the view  that the proposed Air Pact was important, amongst other reasons, for the &apos;&apos; clear indica- tion which, unlike the Locarno Treaty, the Convention contains that the integrity of Britain  is a vital interest to France.&quot;    2.  The next important development is the discussions which proceeded with the Italian Government about the Air Pact and the British guarantee to Italy and the Italian guarantee to this country (see Central Department memorandum of the 14th October, 1936i).    3.  The next important development for the present purpose is the German note giving the German Governments views on the Air Pact dated the 29th May,- 1935.  This note forwarded the draft of an Air Pact, one of the articles of which reads that,  &quot; if one of the high  contracting parties is the object of an attack by the air force of  another high contracting  party without having provoked that attack,  the remaining  high  contracting parties  will immediately  come  to the assistance of the party attacked with all  the air forces  at their disposal.&quot;  In both their  notes$ of the 7th and 31st March, 1936, the German Government declared their readiness to conclude an Air Pact &apos;&apos; in order to strengthen further the security agreements between the Western Powers.&quot;    4.  In the meantime, in the  Text of Proposals of the 19th March the British, Belgian,  French and Italian Governments had stated that the  reinforcement of their security &apos;&apos; ought to include, in particular, undertakings of mutual assistance between Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, together with suitable measures to ensure prompt and effective  action of  the  guarantor  Powers and technical agreements for the preparation of measures to ensure the working ofthe assistance obligations.&quot;   Later, in the Foreign Office memorandum $  of the 19th August on the preparations for  the proposed Five-Power Conference it is stated  that &apos;&apos; we presumably wish  in the new agreement to be  guaranteed by France, and possibly Belgium, and this would, for the sake of equality, involveequally a guarantee by Germany.....  The Committee of Imperial  Defence are being asked to consider the implications of our acceptance of a guarantee by France, Belgium  and Germany.&quot; The views of the Chiefs of Staff contained in their memorandum of the 1st September were generally in favour of a guarantee, and they stated  that on balance their conclusion was &quot; that we have something definite to gain from receiving a guarantee under any new agreement, and that,in view of our vulnerability to  air attack, we should make every endeavour to obtain such a guarantee.&quot;                                          (Signed)      R.

                   ANNEX TO ENCLOSURE TO APPENDIX A.  Note on the Understanding  between Great Britain  and Italy  that neither         Country should guarantee the other in a Western Air Pact.    THE communique^ issued at the conclusion of the Anglo-French meeting inLondon  on the 2nd and 3rd  February,  1935, contains  the  following  passageregarding  an air pact:  &quot; The British and French Ministers, on behalf of theirrespective  Governments,  found themselves in agreement that  a mutual arrange -ment of this kind for Western Europe would go far to operate as a deterrent to aggresion and to ensure immunity from sudden attacks from the air;  and theyresolve to invite Italy, Germany and Belgium to consider with them whether sucha convention might not be promptly negotiated.&quot;    2.   On  the  same day  instructions  were sent to Sir  E.  Drummond  tocommunicate the text of the Anglo-French communique&quot; to Signor Mussolini andto express the hope that  the Italian  Government would approve and support theproposals contained therein.   For his own information, Sir E. Drummond was informed that mention of Italy  did not imply that  there would be reciprocalguarantees between Great Britain and that country.    3.   Sir E. Drummond at once replied that, since the communique spoke of amutual arrangement, he  felt sure  that the Italian Government would read it as implying the full participation of Italy.  If Italy felt that  she  was being leftout in the  cold, the consequences might be, to say the least of  it, unhappy.  Evenif the Italian Government did not take up the point at once, he thought it wouldbe desirable  that they should be made aware at the earliest possible moment ofthe intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government so that no misunderstanding should arise.    4.   On  the  same  day  Sir  E.  Drummond  reported that  he had  givenSignor Suvich the text of the London communique, and that he had expressed thehope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that it would meet with the approval of theItalian  Government.  In order  to  dissipate Signor  Suvich&apos;s assumption thatthe air agreement would be of  a general character, including  both Great Britainand Italy, Sir E. Drummond added  that, speaking purely  personally, he believedthat what was suggested might be a development of the Locarno system with theaddition that each guaranteeing Power would itself be guaranteed by France andGermany as regards the air.    5.   On  the  4th February a  telegram* was  sent  to  Sir  E.  Drummondapproving his language to Signor Suvich.  Attention was  drawn to the fact that.the Anglo-French communique only considered the application of the air agree-ment to Western Europe.  This did not mean that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government had lost sight of the fact that the plan must be soconstructed as to include all the Locarno Powers.  It was for this  reason that the communique definitely stated that Italy was  one of the countries  to be&quot; consulted as regards its negotiation.   It would be appreciated that the question whether his Majesty&apos;s Government contemplated entering into completely new commit-ments was an important one.  Under Locarno Italy and Great Britain have nocommitments to each other.  In the view of the French and British Ministers, theproposed  air agreement  as  applicable to Western Europe  would  involve theextension  to Great Britain of  the guarantee of France, Germany and Belgium.But it was not suggested that either Italy or Great Britain  should be asked toextend the radius of their obligations under Locarno by guaranteeing each other.It was important that all the Locarno Powers should co-operate in the new agree-ment, and it was hoped that it might be possible so to construct the latter that ineffect Great  Britain would exchange guarantees with  France,  Germany andBelgium,  while  Italy would  exchange  similar  guarantees   with  France andGermany.   Sir E.  Drummond was informed that His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be grateful for any impressions or suggestions that the Italian government might be prepared  to give at this early stage.[14036]* Not reproduced.
    6.  On the 5th February the Italian Ambassador spoke to Sir R. Vansittartabout the proposed air pact.  He said that he felt sure that his Government would insist that there should be not two agreements, but one agreement concludedbetween the five Locarno Powers  &quot; with the same obligations and advantages.&quot;Signor  Grandi  himself  also felt  strongly  that one agreement would be farpreferable to two.  His idea (which he had already mentioned to the Secretary ofState) was that, while keeping to  one agreement, this country and Italy should sign a special arrangement  (there  were  several treaties  under Locarno,  he said)in which they would relieve  each other from the practical application as between themselves  of the assistance provided for.  The Ambassador laid great stress onthe high political  necessity  of  not disturbing &quot;the Locarno structure&quot;  or the close texture of Anglo-Italian relations.   Speaking privately, he said that he feltthis was a most important point.   Signor Grandi&apos;s statements made it clear that italy would not wish to be relegated to a second (or, in her eyes, secondary) placein the agreement.   Sir  R.  Vansittart  told  the Ambassador  that the  ItalianGovernment had been asked for any  suggestions of comments that they might wish to make, and he said that he would telegraph to Signor Mussolini makingthe suggestion which he had already described to Sir R. Vansittart.    Sir E.  Drummond was thereupon instructed to seek an interview with signor mussolini soon after Signor Grandi&apos;s telegram might be presumed to have reached him.    7.  On the 6th February Sir E. Drummond explained to Signor Suvich thegeneral views of His Majesty&apos;s  Government as regards the proposed air  arrange-ments and asked whether the Italian Government preferred one or two conventions.Signor Suvich replied that he considered that one general instrument was prefer-able.   He suggested, however, that this single  convention should be concludedbetween  all the Locarno Powers  with a  proviso  that owing  to  geographicalconsiderations no guarantee was given by Great Britain to Italy nor by Italy toGreat Britain.   He thought that such a solution was desirable for two  reasons:first, that it definitely brought in all the Locarno Powers, and, secondly, that the prench now seemed desirous  to extend the convention suggested as between France,Italy and Germany to the Little Entente and possibly other Powers.   He was opposed to  any such generalisation, and wished the guaranteed and guarantors tobe limited to those included in the Locarno Treaty.  Signor Suvich said that hewould ask Signor Mussolini  for his approval of this proposal.    8.  On the 7th February Signor Grandi called at the Foreign Office and read to the Secretary of State the substance of a telegram which he had received fromSignor Mussolini.   Italy was disposed to approve the broad lines of the suggestedplan  for aerial assistance  between the Locarno Powers in  the general formproposed, but Signor Mussolini wanted there to be a single agreement embracingall five Locarno Powers and not  two regional  agreements, one of  which would include ourselves but not Italy, and the other of which would include Italy but notourselves.  In order, however, to exclude the case of the United Kingdom being required to render assistance to Italy or vice versa Signor Mussolini was  in agree-ment with the suggestion of  a temporary protocol or  some such instrument enteredinto between Italy and this  country under which we mutually agreed not to look to one another for aerial assistance under the agreement.   Signor Grandi and theSecretary of State had already discussed this method of achieving the main resultin a single instrument while ruling out  its  application to assistance rendered bythis country and Italy  inter se, and the Ambassador expressed his pleasure  in finding that Signor Mussolini was ready to adopt these ideas.  Sir John Simonsaid that His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatly regret the necessity for working out an air agreement in a form which did  not put  this  country and Italy in thesame document.  Signor Grandi stated that  it would be the first time  since thewar in which Italy and the United Kingdom would be  making correspondingagreements in separate documents, and he most earnestly trusted that  we couldkeep  the arrangement within the boundary  of  Locarno,  neither more  nor less.Signor Mussolini&apos;s view was that if there was  any question of including othercountries such as the Little Entente, that ought to come by separate negotiationslater on.                                                               ;     Sir  John Simon pointed out to  the Ambassador,  and he agreed,  that the simple formula of a protocol under which Italy and the United Kingdom under -took not to look to one another for assistance under the main agreement, would not
cover all the cases which must be excluded.  For example, in the improbableassumption  of  Italy  making  an unprovoked aggression  by air on  France orGermany, Sir John Simon presumed that Signor Mussolini did not desire that weshould be bound to assist the State attacked, yet if there was a single reciprocalagreement between the five  Locarno Powers  this case would be covered and itwould not be excluded by a protocol in the terms hitherto  suggested.  Similarly,we must  consider the equally  improbable  case of an unprovoked attack by  thiscountry on  France or Germany.  We  did  not desire, while excusing Italy fromassisting  us if we were attacked,  to find Italy  under  the obligation in  thisimaginary case of coming in against  us.  It  would therefore be necessary,  if asingle agreement between  the  five Locarno Powers was the main document, toprovide for  the cases excluded  along  somewhat different lines;  for  example, we might say that nothing in the document would  require either the United kingdom or Italy to take action under  it  in a class of case not covered by its existing obliga-tions under the Locarno Agreements.    9.  On  the  17th February Signor Suvich  drew  the  attention of Sir E.Drummond  to certain juridical questions, which would require careful considera-tion in connection with  the  conclusion of  an  air convention. By the Treaty of locarno Italy and Great Britain were bound to go to the assistance of germany or France, whichever of the latter was attacked.  But supposing under a  new convention France were to guarantee England in the air, and Germany attackedGreat Britain,  then France would have to attack Germany.  Italy might not, how-ever, have any legal cognisance of the French guarantee to Great  Britain  andmight find  herself compelled by reason of Locarno to go to the  assistance ofGermany as having been attacked by France.   Sir  E.  Drummond remindedSignor Suvich that the Covenant of the League prevailed against any subsequenttreaty and that in such a case  of aggression, surely Italy would have to supportthe attacked party.    10.   At the  Anglo-French conversation  in Paris on  the 28th  February,M. Laval communicated the text of a draft air pact.  This French draft contains an Anglo-Italian reservation as a protocol to be attached to the convention.    11.   This  French draft was subsequently circulated by M. Laval  to  theBritish and Italian Delegations at the Stresa Conference.   A British draft  wasalso circulated.  Article 3 of  the British draft reads as follows : &apos;&apos; The provisionsof the  present treaty shall not impose any obligation upon either the UnitedKingdom or Italy in a  case  to  which the  obligations of that Power underArticle 4 of the Treaty of Locarno would not be applicable.  In particular, neitherthe United  Kingdom  nor Italy shall  be under any obligation,  in virtue of  thepresent treaty,  to come to the assistance of  the other.&quot;    In the  Joint  Resolution of the Conference at  Stresa it  was stated that thethree Governments agreed to continue actively the study of the question of an air pact with a view to the drafting of a pact  between the five Powers mentionedin the London  communique&apos;  and of  any bilateral  agreements which mightaccompany it.    12.   No step was taken to implement the Stresa Resolution until the 7th May,1935,  when  His  Majesty&apos;s  Ambassadors  in  Paris  and Rome  were asked toascertain  if the French and  Italian Governments would be  ready to agree to a four-Power  (including Belgium)  Jurists&apos;  Meeting in  Geneva,  &quot; privately  andunobtrusively to  discuss the two drafts of a proposed air pact and  any other suggestions  as  to  the drafting of the  pact.&quot;  The French,  Italian and belgian governments all agreed to this meeting, which took place on the 28th May, 1935.Sir W. Malkin in his report on this meeting states that his Italian colleague  hadno instructions at all, and did not know of the  agreement which had been reached between the United Kingdom  and Italy that each of them should not give aguarantee either to or against  the other.   Neither his Italian nor his Frenchcolleague  showed any knowledge of what the position was to be as between Franceand Italy as regards any guarantees going beyond those existing under Locarno.The Belgian and  French Representatives  intimated that their  countries wouldnot be prepared to guarantee Italy against the United Kingdom or the UnitedKingdom  against Italy.    As regards the English  draft already circulated  at the time of the StresaConference, the Jurists made  the following comments on Article 3:  &quot;It was
observed that this Article only limits the guarantees given by the United Kingdomand Italy.  This involves the more general problem of determining the States whogive  guarantees  and the States who receive them.  This  question of principlemust be settled before seeking the proper formula to express the solution which is adopted.&quot;                                        (Signed)       V. G. LAWFORD.    Foreign Office, October 14, 1936.APPENDIX  B. Translation of a Memorandum communicated by the German Charge d&apos;Affaires   on October 14, respecting the Proposed Meeting of the Five Locarno Powers.     THE German Government have the honour to express their views as  follows with regard  to  the  questions  raised in  the memorandum of His Majesty&apos;s Government of the 17th September, so far  as this is possible without knowledge of the attitude of the other Governments concerned at this stage of the  present exchange of views.     1.  The  German  Government assume, from  the  terms of the invitation conveyed to them on the basis of the London communique of the 23rd July last, and their reply thereto, that the subject  to be dealt with by the conference will be the replacement of the old Rhine Pact of Locarno by a new  pact between Germany, Belgium, France,  Great Britain and Italy.  If  the communique in question contemplates the discussion later  on of other problems connected with the securing  of  European peace, a decision with  regard  to these problems (as indeed the communique itself indicates) can only be reached when the result of the conference of the Five Powers, with respect to the subject  to be dealt with at that conference, has been arrived at. The German Government must therefore reserve  till then their attitude with regard to the question whether, and if so which, other problems in given circumstances might later be  discussed.     2.  The structure of the new pact would naturally  have  to take into account the political developments  which have given rise to the plan for such a pact.  The German Government,  as already proposed in their peace plan of the 31st March last, accordingly regard obligations for non-aggression  between Germany on the one hand and Belgium and  France on the  other, and the guaranteeing of these obligations by Great  Britain and Italy, as the essential  elements  of the pact. The answer to the question  whether these elements in the treaty should further be supplemented by  non-aggression and guarantee obligations between other treaty partners will have  to depend on whether such an extension of the  system of the old Rhine Pact is in the general interests of peace and whether it can be introduced without upsetting the  necessary balance of the treaty  system.  The German  Government  will only be able  to form their final judgment  on this point when they have learned the views of  the other Governments concerned.     3.   The German Government, in their peace plan of the 31st March last, have already declared themselves prepared for a renunciation of  aggression vis-a-vis- Belgium and France unrestricted by any exceptions. From their standpoint they have no motive for weakening the security for peace which lies in the conclusion of such an agreement for the renunciation of aggression by demanding exceptions of any kind whatever.  In case .the other  Governments concerned should think it necessary to insist on making exceptions  of this kind, it would be for them to put forward proposals to this end.  Meanwhile, however, the German government must indicate at once that  they do not  consider the method  proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in  their memorandum of the 17th September to be prac-ticable.   In article 2  of the old Rhine Pact, to which the memorandum  refers, the important exceptions  in  practice to  the provisions for  the renunciation of aggression are laid down with reference to  the provisions of  the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, and in particular to article 16 thereof.  The repetition of theuse of this method is, in the view  of the German Government, precluded by the fact that the interpretation of article 16 has led to the  well-known  differences ofopinion between Germany and the other Locarno Powers, and, furthermore, by the
fact that the discussion regarding the future of article 16 and other provisions ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations is at present still quite open.    4.   The German Government do not consider it either necessary or appro-priate to submit to the Council of the League of Nations the question of deciding whether an  infringement  of the obligation of non-aggression has taken place and consequently whether the guarantee obligation has entered into force.    It will be necessary to examine whether such decisions should not be reached by a common decision of the parties  to the treaty who are not, in  a  given case,directly  parties to the conflict.   A distinction between flagrant breaches of thetreaty and other kinds of  breaches of the treaty, such as  was laid down in theold Rhine Pact, will no longer come into consideration in the new pact.    5.   The obligations of non-aggression  on which  agreement is  to be reachedwill, naturally, have to extend also to air attacks.   Moreover, the rendering ofassistance  by the guarantor Powers  would have  to  cover their air forces  also.The German Government, therefore, share the view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat there  is no necessity for a special air pact.    6.   The German Government consider  it appropriate that the parties to thetreaty, especially  those between  whom obligations of non-aggression are agreedupon, should at the same time  reach agreements, by suitable peaceful procedure,for the settlement of the disputes arising between them.    Berlin, October 12, 1936.APPENDIX  C.  Telegram from Sir E. Drummond (Rome), No. 654, dated  October 19, 1936.    My despatch No. 1097* and your telegram No. 383.*    I received  this  morning  note dated  18th October setting forth ItalianGovernment&apos;s point of view in reply to our memorandum of 17th September.    Note, of which translation goes by air mail to-night, is about the same lengthas our memorandum,  and is couched in general and friendly terms. agreement is as follows :     Most hopeful approach will be to take Treaty of Locarno as a basis, adaptingit to any changing circumstances  without  altering its general bearing and its essential characteristics.  Its  fundamental  principles are (a) the  precise under-taking  given by France, Belgium and Germany not to have  recourse to war between themselves;  (b) joint guarantee by  Italy and Great  Britain  of  non-aggression  agreements  between France, Belgium  and Germany.  Question of guarantees  interests,  particularly  England and Italy,  and Italian government considers further examination of this point to be necessary.    His Majesty&apos;s Government  seem  to  wish  to introduce a new  principle,namely, reciprocity, i.e., His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to renewLocarno guarantee in respect  of  non-aggression agreements between  Germany,France and Belgium in return for  similar guarantee in favour of Great britain on the  part of Germany against  France,  and on the part of France againstGermany.   Thus principle enunciated in communique&quot; of 3rd February for air pact would become the basis of entire system of guarantees of new treaty.  this seems to Italian Government of great importance.  In  their view the essence of locarno guarantee was  joint Italian and British undertaking  and real  force of treaty of Locarno consisted in the fact that aggressor would in every case findhimself  confronted by  united forces,  the victim of  aggression  and the  twoguarantor  Powers.  Will this fundamental unity be preserved under  a regimeof mutual guarantees or will not it mean that Locarno  Treaty will be broken up into two tripartite systems which would  alter position  of  guaranteed States?The joint guarantee would disappear and  for all practical effects treaty wouldbe broken into two separate pacts of mutual  assistance, one Anglo-French-Germanand the other Italo-Franco-German, only  formally joined in  framework  of  ageneral pact. This would mean a  weakening in Italian view of Locarno system which is certainly not the intention of any of  the five Powers.* Not reproduced.
     In proceeding  to  examination of the other questions raised by  Britishmemorandum on which Italian Government will give their opinion later, it seemsnecessary  for signatory States to reach agreement upon character of new treaty and to decide whether it is their intention or not to reconstitute that treaty onits original basis.    Italian  Government state  that copies of this document, which  is not for publication,  will be sent to Governments of Germany, France and Belgium.APPENDIX  D.  Extract from the French Governments Memorandum of September 30, 1936.                    TV&quot;          &quot;A*           ^          &quot;TV&quot;           &quot;/V&quot;    JUST as the Treaty of Locarno is based upon a guarantee of the territorialstatus  quo resulting from the  frontiers  between  Germany and Belgium and between  Germany and  France,  and a  guarantee of the inviolability  of  thesefrontiers, the new agreement should be based upon the  recognition of the factthat there does not exist between the contracting parties any territorial dispute,and consequently,  in their mutual relations, upon  an individual and collectiveguarantee of the  territorial  status  quo as well as of the inviolability of  the frontiers of their territories and dependencies.
