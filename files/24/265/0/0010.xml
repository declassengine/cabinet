CABINET.CP. 290(36)PUBLIC  ORDER:. bill memorandum by the Home Secretary.1.        At its meeting on the 28th October, the cabinet agreed (Cabinet Conclusions 60(36) Conclusion 7)  to postponefurther consideration of this matter until the Bill in final draft was before them.2.        The proposals summarised in the Report  of theCommittee on Preservation of Public Order (C.P.282(36)) havebeen further considered by the Cabinet Sub-Committee, and thedraft Bill,  of which a copy is attached,  embodies therecommendations of the Sub-Committee,  which are now submittedto the Cabinet for approval.3.        The following is a summary of the more  importantprovisions of the Bill:-          /     (A)   Political Uniforms.4.        The Sub-Committee, after careful consideration ofvarious methods of dealing with this difficult problem, have cometo the conclusion that the simplest and most satisfactory solution is a direct prohibition of the wearing in any publicplace or at any public meeting of any uniform signifyingassociation with any political organisation or with the furtheringof any political object.   Permission to wear such uniform onany ceremonial, anniversary, or other occasion may, however, begranted by a Chief Officer of Police,  with the approval of theSecretary of State,  if the Chief Officer is  satisfied that the
wearing of such uniform on that occasion will not he  likelyto involve risk of public disorder.   No attempt is made to define what constitutes a uniform for this purpose, hut it isbelieved that the Courts will not find any considerabledifficulty in determining this question,  and, in order to preventvexatious prosecutions and extravagant interpretations, it isprovided that the consent of the Attorney General is  required before the Court can dispose of any charge of the illegal wearingof political uniforms.     (B)  Private Armies.5.        The Bill lays down the general proposition  that anyassociation is illegal if its members or adherents are (a)organised or trained or equipped for the purpose of enabling themto be employed in usurping the functions of the police or of HisMajesty&apos;s forces, or (b) organised and either trained or equipped for the purpose of enabling them to be employed for the use ordisplay of physical force in furthering any political object,or in such manner as to arouse reasonable apprehension that thatis the purpose of their organisation and training or  equipment.Any person taking part in the control or management of any suchunlawful association or in organising or training its members inthe manner described would be guilty of an offence, and the bill provides for the winding up under the Companies Act,  1929, of anysuch association if, on a petition presented by the attorney general, the Court is satisfied that it is an unlawful association6.        This Clause (Clause 2) is the kernel of the Bill.   Theprinciple which it enunciates will, I hope, be universallyaccepted, since everyone dislikes the introduction of foreignmethods into the politics of this country and since the formationof one private army inevitably leads to the formation of othercounter forces .    Indeed evidence is not lacking that the
existence of the quasi-military Fascist organisation is alreadycausing certain of the political opponents of Fascism to bandthemselves into an organisation for the purpose of counteringFascism by force .      (C)  Processions.7.        At present in London the Commissioner of Police hascertain powers of routeing processions, and outside Londonsimilar powers are possessed by the Councils;of boroughs and urban districts, but there is no specific power to prohibit aprocession or to require it to disperse so long as it isorderly or is not an unlawful assembly.8.        Recent experiences, particularly in the East End ofLondon - though the problem is not confined to London - haveshown the need for further powers to control processions y/hichare frequently provocative of disorder, to say nothing of thedifficulties to which they give rise in modern traffic conditions.9.        The preservation of public order and the precautionary measures necessary for this purpose are a function of the police and not of local government.   The Bill accordingly proposes,while leaving undisturbed the existing powers of localauthorities, to empower Chief Officers of Police, if theyapprehend that a particular procession may lead to seriouspublic disorder, to impose such conditions as appear to benecessary for the preservation of public order.   Under thisprovision it would not be open to a Chief Officer of Police  to prohibit a procession at his discretion, but he could, e.g.,prohibit the carrying of provocative banners or the shouting of offensive slogans.   The Bill further provides that, should  a chief Officer of Police be of opinion that, owing to the
conditions in his police district or any part thereof,  thepower to attach conditions is not sufficient to prevent seriousdisorder resulting from the holding of processions,  he  shallapply to the Council of the borough or urban district,  as thecase may be, for an order prohibiting for a specified period the holding of any processions or any class of processions  in the borough or urban district or part thereof, and they may,  withthe consent of the Secretary of State, make an order in theterms of the application or with such modifications as  may be approved by the Secretary of State.   In London the commissioner would apply direct to the Secretary of State, as the police   rauthority, without first applying to the local authority.10.       This scheme,  while enabling a certain measure ofcontrol to be exercised over processions, appears to provide adequate safeguards against bureaucratic and unnecessary inter-ference with the freedom of assembly and demonstration.     (D)  Meetings.11.       The only other provision to which I desire to callspecial attention is the proposal to amend the Public MeetingAct, 1908, by (a) empowering a constable to require a person whom he reasonably suspects  of committing an offence against that Act(i.e.,  of acting in a disorderly manner for the purpose of preventing transaction  of business for which the meeting was calletogether) to declare to him his name and address, (b) making itan offence for a person so requested to refuse his name and address or to give a false name and address, and (c) empowering aconstable to arrest without warrant a person who refuses, when sorequired, to declare his name and address or whom the constablesuspects of giving a false name and address.
12.       At present the Public Meeting Act,  1908,  ispractically a dead letter, since the law provides no machineryfor its effective enforcement.   Organised interrupters cannot he compelled to give their name and address,  and, where the organisers of a meeting are willing to prosecute, they are often unable to do so because they cannot ascertain the identity of the offenders.   The Fascists justify the brutalmethods they have employed on occasions - notably at Olympiain June, 1954 - on the ground that only by these means can  theright of free speech be preserved, and it seems  desirable,  ifpossible,  to stop the gap left in the Act of 1908.    On theother hand,  it is clearly desirable that the police should  notbe put into the position of acting as stewards of public meetings.    The position of the police would be  very invidiousif they were made responsible for enforcing the  Public MeetingAct, 1908, and the Committee accordingly recommend that, whilethe police - if present at a public meeting - should beempowered to ascertain the names and addresses of personscommitting offences against that Act for the purpose of givingthe information to the organisers of the meeting, it should beleft to the party aggrieved, i.e., the organisers of themeeting, to take proceedings, and that the police should not bedrawn into the arena of party politics by being  made responsiblefor the enforcement of the Act.13.       The object of the Committee has been to propose only such amendments of the law as appear to be called for by thepresent situation without any unnecessary interference with theliberties  of the subject.   The Bill holds the balance as evenlyas possible between the rival factions of Fascism and Communism,and my interview with the leaders of the Opposition leads me to
believe that the principles of the Bill will he openly-supported from the other side of the House.14.        I should &quot;be glad to have the authority of theCabinet for the early introduction of the Bill.J.S .3rd November, 1936
