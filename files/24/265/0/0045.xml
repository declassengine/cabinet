SECRET.CP.  325  (36)                               THE cabinet copy  NO.    4 4THE  ORGANIZATION, ARMAMENT AND EQUIPMENT                         OF THE ARMY    The subjoined memorandum was originally issued as D.P.R.  145.   In accordance    20with conclusion 2 (ii)  of the 30th Meeting of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy  Generaland  Requirements,  1 now circulate  it to  accompany  my  memorandum on the   ^572re-equipment of the Territorial Army (The Role of the British Army ;  CP. 326 (36)).                                                                       D. C.    THE WAR OFFICE,         4th December, 1936.    1. The Monthly Progress Reports hitherto  submitted  to the Sub-Committee  on defence Policy and Requirements  have  dealt  with  the subject  mainly from thepoint  of view  of production of  material.    In the paragraphs which follow is given a  summary of the present situation asregards the organization,  armament  and equipment  of the Army in  relation  to  itsreadiness for war, and a forecast  of the stages by which it is hoped to reorganize andre-equip it on modern lines.                      THE REGULAR FIELD FORCE                    FUTURE COMPOSITION AND  ORGANIZATION    2. The Regular Field Force is to consist of two Corps,  each of two divisions, onemobile division of two (mechanized) cavalry brigades, and a  tank  brigade, togetherwith the necessary ancillary units and services, and L. of C. troops.    3. As the result of further  examination  of the strategical and  tactical problems involved, the Army  Council consider it essential to include in the Regular Field Forceone Anti-Aircraft group (previously described as an Air Defence Brigade) additional tothe two refeiTed to in paragraph 65 of  Paper  No. D.R.C. 37.    Apart  from this, the general composition  of the Force remains as indicated inD.R.C.  37.  although recent developments  in  armament  and other  material, andexperiments in their use, have led to changes  in  the organization and  equipment ofcertain units, and their distribution within the Force, and may lead to further changesin the future.    Where necessary, Treasury  sanction is  being, or will be, sought for  such changes.    4. The Army Council have been charged by His Majesty&apos;s Government with thetask of organizing existing Army formations in the most effective form, and equippingthem  with the  most modern armament  and  equipment, at the earliest possible date.    The main changes in organization, armament and equipment which are proposed,in order to achieve this object, are as follows :   .    (i) Cavalry.     (a) Eight regiments (instead of six only, as originally  proposed) will, subject to           India&apos;s co-operation  (see  paragraph 5 (iii)  below), be converted  from a           horsed to a mechanized basis, in order to provide  the  four  cavalry  light           tank regiments required  for the  two (mechanized)  cavalry brigades and           four (mechanized) divisional cavalry regiments.  It is possible that the           latter will also be equipped with light tanks.    (&amp;) Cavalry brigades will each consist  of two light tank regiments, and oneportee           infantry battalion.                        Printed for the Cabinet, December, 1936
     (ii) Artillery.     (a) All divisional  field  artillery,  which has  hitherto  been  horsed, will  be            mechanized.  Non-divisional field artillery brigades are already mechanized,            as are also all medium brigades.     (b) All field  artillery  brigades,  which  are at present  equipped  partly  with            18-pdrs. and partly with  4*5-inch howitzers, will be re-equipped  with            25-pdrs.     (c) The requisite reserves of ammunition  will be built up for the new weapon.     (iii) Engineers and Signals.                All units of these arms will  be completely mechanized as regards            their 1st line transport, and up-to-date equipment (including, for  the            Signals units, wireless sets of new  designs) will be provided.     (iv) Infantry      (a) Battalions will be re-organized as rifle and machine gun battalions.                Infantry brigades will in future consist of three rifle battalions only,            while machine gun battalions will become units of divisional  and corps            troops (two a division, and one  to each corps).     (b) The 1st line transport of all infantry  battalions will  be mechanized.     (c) Rifle battalions will be provided with  new weapons, in  the shape of Bren            light machine guns (in place of  Lewis guns), anti-tank rifles and mortars.     (d) Machine gun battalions will be armed with heavy (Vickers) machine guns,            carried   in  armoured  and   tracked  &quot; carriers,&quot;  and  anti-tank   guns,            mechanically towed.     (v) Royal  Tank Corps.     (a) The Tank  Brigade has to be entirely re-equipped  with both  medium  and            light tanks.     (b) Three  new  Army tank  battalions are  to be  formed (only one exists at            present).                The  whole of  the  equipment  for these battalions has  yet to  be            provided.            CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE RATE  OF RE-ORGANIZATION     5.  In  order that  the nature and  extent  of  the problem of re-organizing  andre-equipping the Army may  he appreciated, it may not be out of place to mention someof the principal factors by which that process is effected :      (i)  The programme of  re-organization  of both  infantry and artillery is retarded            by the necessity  of maintaining two divisions ready for immediate despatch            overseas,  since  units which  are in process of re-organization  cannot be            mobilized at short notice ; they are temporarily hors de combat.     (ii) It is essential to maintain the closest  co-operation with India as regards  any            changes in the organization of British units.  The change-over to separate            rifle  and  machine-gun  battalions,  in  place  of  the  mixed  battalions,            depended on India&apos;s ability to accept such changes.                Owing&apos; to our draft-finding liabilities for the British Army in India,            the  mechanization of more than  six cavalry regiments at Home depends on            the  mechanization, pari passu-, of British cavalry ^regiments in India.                These questions&quot; are  now  under discussion with the India  Office and            the  Government of India, and an early settlement is urgently required.    (iii) A considerable  time must elapse  between  the  start of the conversion of a            cavalry regiment, from a horsed to a mechanized basis, and the  time when            it is fully trained in  the use of  its  new equipment.    (iv) Similarly,  the  conversion  of the infantry of a division, to the  separate  rifle            and machine gun  basis, and the training of the battalions in  their new            r61es, and with in  the  case of the  machine gun battalions their new            equipment, takes roughly six months.
     (v)  The  x*ate of re-equipment of artillery&apos; with  a new  weapon does not depend           merely on the production of  the weapon itself, but also on the provision           of adequate  reserves of ammunition for it.  At the  present time sufficient           reserves of  18-pdr. and  4&quot;5-inch howitzer ammunition are being built up           to maintain  two divisions (see (i) above) in the  field  for the period that           must elapse before post-mobilization manufacture  can catch up with the           anticipated expenditure.                In addition,  preparations are being  made  for the manufacture of           sufficient stocks of 25-pdr. ammunition to meet the requirements (including           reserves) of the whole Field Force.                It is to be noted, in this connection, that, in  order to obviate maiu-           tenance difficulties in  the field, artillei-y  brigades  cannot be re-equipped           individually ;  re-equipment must be carried out on a divisional basis.     (vi)  When the design of a new tank  has been  settled, it takes roughly a year           (under peace conditions) before that tank is &quot; in production,&quot; and probably           another year before units are fully equipped with it and trained in its use.                            PRESENT SITUATION     6. At present the  maximum force which we could despatch  overseas at short notice would consist of  two divisions, with a proportion of non-divisional troops.     This force would not  be  provided with up-to-date armament and  equipment, andwould not be &quot; fit for war &quot;, according to modern standards.     Among its defects and deficiencies the following are important :      Divisional cavalry  and artillery  would still be on a horsed  basis.                 i     Field artillery would still be equipped with 18-pdrs. and i^o-inch howitzers.     Infantry battalions would not have been re-organized, and  their 1st line transport       would still be horsed.     Units would not  have their respective quotas of anti-tank guns, anti-tank rifles, or       Bren guns.     Much of the Engineers and Signals  equipment would be of out-of-date patterns.     No Tank units would be available to accompany the  force.     7. A substantial beginning has, however, been made in the process of re-organiza-tion and  re-equipment;  the  most  important steps  already taken, or  to be takenshortly, are      (i)  The conversion of five cavalry regiments to a mechanized basis has begun.           A sixth will   be  converted  on arrival  from India  next relief  season.           The conversion of the remaining two (see paragraph 4 (i) (a) above) will           begin as soon as agreement is reached with India on the subject of  cavalry           mechanization  (see paragraph 5 (iii) above).     (ii)  The mechanization of two divisional  artilleries has begun.   This  should be           completed  by next summer,  when  the remaining divisional artilleries  will           be mechanized.    (iii)  The complete mechanization of Engineers and Signals units is being carried out.    (iv)  The infantry of one division is now being reorganized on a rifle and machine           gun battalion basis.  It  is proposed shortly to begin the reorganization of           all other  battalions at Home, except those included  in the two divisions           at   present earmarked  for  despatch  overseas  in  an  emergency  (see           paragraph 5 (i) above).                The infantry of the 1st Division will be  re-organized immediately on           its return from Palestine.                Machine  gun battalions cannot at first  be  re-organized in their final           form, since  they will not have the armoured machine gun  carriers with           which they are eventually  to  be  provided,  and which are  tactically an           essential feature of their organization.  Until the carriers are available, the           machine guns and their  crews will be conveyed in unarmoured wheeled           vehicles.     (v)   The 1st line  transport of  all infantry  battalions except those of the two           &quot; earmarked &quot; divisions (see (iv) above) is being  mechanized.    (vi) A second &quot; Army  &quot; tank battalion will shortly be created  ; owing to shortage           of trained personnel, it can at first be created in  cadre form only.                N.B. No detailed reference  is  being  made  in this paper to the           provision  of armament  and  equipment, since this subject is dealt with in           the War Office Progress Reports.
                                FUTUUK PROGRESS     8. Assuming that the production  of  new  armament and  equipment  proceedsaccording to present expectations ; that recruiting is satisfactory  ; that India falls in with our plans in regard to mechanization ; and that no &quot; emergencies &quot; occur to delayour programme ;  it is hoped that by the  summer of 1939 the Regular  Field Force, as described in  paragraph 2  above, will  be, generally  speaking, re-organized, re-armed and  re-equipped, in the manner  proposed will  be, in other words, &quot; prepared  forwar &quot;, except possibly, in one or two particulars, namely :      (i)  The third  Anti-Aircraft group,  which will probably have to be raised on  a           Territorial  Army basis,  may not be  fully trained up  to the  desired           standard.    (ii)  According to the present programme, the whole of the field artillery may  not           be  equipped with the 25-pdr.:  there  is,  however, a possibility that the           provision  of 25-pdrs. (and  the ammunition for them see paragraph 5  (vi)           above) may be accelerated.     9. As regards the intermediate  stages, while it is  not  possible to forecast thesewith certainty, it is hoped that the following will be achieved :      (i)  By ihe autumn of 1937 :          The equipment of the two divisions earmarked for despatch  overseas,  in  an     emergency,  should be improved to the following extent:              Divisional artillery should all be on a mechanized basis, the infantry should         be re-organized, and the infantry  1st line transport should be mechanized,         except  that   aimioured  machine-gun  carriers will  probably  not  yet  be         available.             The divisions should have their correct  complement of anti-tank guns         and anti-tank rifles, but will not yet be equipped  with Bren guns.             It should be  possible to include a light tank battalion, equipped with the         existing type of light tank, in the non-divisional troops  accompanying these         divisions.     (ii) By the Spring of  1938 :          Three  divisions should  be lit  to   take  the  field,  but  with  the  following    probable defects  and deficiencies in  their equipment:      (a) it  is doubtful  whether  the divisional cavalry regiments,  on a mechanized           basis, will  by that time be fully  equipped and trained.     (b) the artillery  of only one division,  at most,   will be re-equipped with  the           25-pdr.     (c)  all rifle battalions may not yet be equipped with the Bren gun, unless provision           of this weapon can be accelerated.         So far  as equipment is concerned,  one (mechanized) cavalry brigade  should     be ready to take  the field.                                   PERSONNEL     10.  This  appreciation is based  on  the personnel  required being  forthcoming.A statement summarizing the position is attached as an Appendix.  From this  it willbe seen  that our resources in personnel must be greatly increased  before we  canmobilize  four divisions and the requisite  Corps troops with  the certainty  of being ableto maintain them in the field.   This matter is  being dealt with in another Memorandum(CP. 326).                             TERRITORIAL  ARMY     11.  The Territorial Army is  not  at present equipped  for war.   Small quantitiesof certain types of modern equipment and transport are being issued gradually fromthe  250,000 a year allotted for instructional and training purposes.  The equipmentotherwise is  mostly of obsolete  pattern, and war  reserves of  nearly  all  items  aredeficient or non-existent.  The Cabinet have  decided to postpone, for the present, the equipment of the  Territorial Army for  war and the provision of the necessary  war reserves.
                    AIR DEFENCE  OF  GREAT  BRITAIN                                     UNITS    12.  Of the 76 batteries authorized,  33 exist;  21 more are being formed inDecember,  1936; the  formation of the remaining 22 is now under investigation.    Similarly, of the  108 searchlight companies authorized,  38 exist; 50 more arebeing  formed in December,  1936; the formation of  the remaining 22 is now underinvestigation.                                  EQUIPMENT    13.  (a) 3-inch  guns. 180 guns out of a total of  608 required  exist or are  on order  for delivery by  31st March, 1937.  Of these,  78 are now  with units  and are complete with all equipment; 22 are ready,  and  will be issued to the  new  unitswhen  they form.    (6) Searchlights. Out of a total of 2,547 required, 511 exist  or are  on order for delivery by 31st March,  1937.   Of these, 201 are with units or at practice camps, and delivery  of  the remainder is expected to continue regularly.  Fifty will be  ready for issue to the new units when they form.                        COAST  DEFENCES ABROAD    14.  The following  is the  situation as regards progress towards the completionof the defences at the more  important ports abroad:                                 (a) Hong  Kong    A small acceleration is being made this year in  the programme for the moderniza-tion of the defences which is on a 10-year programme.                                 (b) Singapore    (i)  The third British battalion authorized will  arrive at the end  of  the  1936/37Trooping Season.    (ii) The provision of the defences already authorized is proceeding satisfactorily,and it is anticipated that the coast defences as at present approved will be completed by the end of 1937.    (iii) Proposals  for  the  provision of certain additional defences will  shortly besubmitted to the  Committee  of Imperial Defence.                                 (c) Trincomali    It is anticipated that the essential defences will be  completed in 1937.                                   (d) Penang    It is proposed  to commence work on the defences  in  1937.                             (e) Colombo  and Aden    It has not been possible to carry out any appreciable  work on the modernizationof the defences of these ports.                             (/) Malta and Gibraltar     A small acceleration is being made this year in the  programme for the moderniza-tion of the defences of  these ports which is  at present  on  a 14-year programme.                                  (g) Freetown     No  work on the  modernization  of these defences  is in hand, but it is proposedto commence work in 1938.     15. The general  provision of modern Anti-Aircraft equipment for  ports abroadwill depend upon production and the claims of the Air Defence of Great Britain andthe Field Force.  This may  involve a  delay in provision for the ports.     16. The shortage of personnel, particularly R.A.  and R.E., may prove to be  alimiting  factor and steps are being  taken to use  Indian and local  personnel  to  themaximum extent.
                                 APPENDIX   NOTE  ON MAN-POWER POSITION  FOR INTERMEDIATE CONTINGENT81.  If we  mobilize the  Intermediate Contingent the war requirements (including      wastage) amount to........................     ...    101,000   Other commitments, e.g., training units, home  establishments and ports abroad      amount to   ..............................     26,0002.  To meet these we have : (a) Serving soldiers of units in Intermediate Contingent      ......     39,500    Regular Reserve allotted to these units.........     ......     37,000    Supplementary Reserve.....................     12,000    Maturing personnel at depots   ..................      6,000    Post-mobilization recruits      ..................      1,500Giving a total liability of      ........................   127,000                                                                               96,000(&amp;) Regular  Reserve and Supplementary Reserve of units  other than  those  in      Intermediate Contingent and serving soldiers in Corps, e.g., R.E. from units      not in Intermediate Contingent   .....................     31,000                Total assets     ........................    127,000          N.B. To make up the R.B. about 400 from the R.E. in Palestine-and      Egypt are required.3. This  leaves  at  home  (including  those  temporarily  in the  Mediterranean)      unallotted on mobilization :         Serving soldiers not in Intermediate Contingent    ............     42,000        Reservists, Supplementary Reserve, etc.     ...............     47,000Total    ..................     ......     ...     89,000    4. With the full Regular Field Force our total liabilities amount to       ......    256,000              i.e., 129,000 more than the Intermediate Contingent, and we have only          89,000 to meet this.   Deficit is therefore 40,000.    Most of this deficit falls in the infantry, whilst the R.E., R.A.S.C. and R.A.O.C. can only justmeet their Intermediate Contingent liabilities.Consisting of two divisions, with quota of non-divisional troops (see paragraphs 5 (i) and 6).(B36/8)  70  12/36  W.O.P. 96
