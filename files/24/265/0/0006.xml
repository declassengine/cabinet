SECRET and Personal.    My despatch, secret, of the 16th October  and last sentence of your telegram,secret and personal, of the 21st October.   I think that you should know that Ihave now seen  a number of local officials  and their unanimous opinion is thatany measure of Arab disarmament would meet with a very small degree of success.    Shertok stated in the course of  a conversation with  Chief  Secretary  on19th October that  while formation of Jewish auxiliary police force would  be welcomed by Jews he thought it most unlikely that any of them would hand over their illicit  arms,  at all events until  after they had gained  confidence  in the capacity  of  the auxiliary  police  to defend them, and were satisfied that  at  nofuture  date auxiliary  police  would  be disbanded  by  Government and  rifleswithdrawn.(2) Personal and Secret Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies       to the High Commissioner for Palestine, dated October 23, 1936.    IMMEDIATE,  Personal and Secret.    In view of what you tell me in our personal telegram of the 22nd October Ishould like to know whether you  wish to vary the recommendations in yourdespatch secret of 16th October regarding the disarmament of Arabs and  Jews.As you know, your despatch will be considered by the Cabinet on 28th October,and before then I must be quite clear as to what  you  think is desirable anduracticable.SECRETl&apos;      if&apos;I&apos;I&apos;.-CP. 286 ^36).[13993]
 (3) Private and Personal Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to         the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated October 25, 1936.........     PRIVATE and Personal.     Your  telegram, 23rd  October.   In my  despatch written four  dgys after calling off of strike  (i.e.,  the  16th October),  there were two main grounds&apos; on which I urged desirability of  disarmament:  (1) to  reduce number of $ifles in possession  of Arabs,  (2) the moral effect of showing  Government determination to ensure security in the future.  Also I was hopeful, after my  interview with Shertok and Ben Gurion,  that the  Jews would agree  to hand in arms  they illegally possess.   Further  interview with agency on the  19th October now make this very  doubtful  and consequently  difficulties of  disarmament  are greatly increased.     As I  reported ten days after calling off of strike  (i.e.,  on 22nd October) officials in  close touch  with villagers  report that though  villagers are freely returning to their normal life they have already hidden  their arms and will not surrender them.  Even application of drastic measures might fail to induce them to disclose  their rifles.  Consequently, my first object to reduce number of illegal arms would probably fail in view of the present spirit of the  people.     I cannot recommend disarmament of Jews by force, and Arab  disarmament is made doubly difficult without some measure of Jewish disarmament.            ^     An unsuccessful attempt to disarm the Arabs would have bad moral, effect, and if very drastic measures were adopted under these circumstances, widespread armed resistance to Government authority would be resumed.   I  have conse^- quently come reluctantly to the conclusion that I can no longer recommend policy of disarmament I outlined in my despatch of 16th October.  As time passes I anticipate  police will obtain information of hidden rifles, and in the  future as in the past will from time to time be able to confiscate  a certain  number of rifles. This might be  accompanied by some  extension or variant of existing system of licensing; but present very severe penalties for unauthorised possession of fire- arms have not in practice deterred both sections of the population  from acquiring and retaining illicit arms  on large scale.  These views are concurred in by the Inspector-General of Police.^ri   Dill, with  whom I  had another  talk on 23rd October, is of opinion that to attempt general disarmament without martial law is  to court failure and risk a recrudescence of rebellion.     In the circumstances, he considers  unless  and until some situation arises in the future demanding martial law,  no attempt should  be made to disarm  the country as a whole.   In the meantime, in his opinion, control of  arms should be undertaken by enforcing a system of licences to possess arms.     As I have  indicated above, I consider that without use of force.and drastic measures no system of licensing could be made effective and complete.
