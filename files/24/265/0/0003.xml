                                                              it SECRET                     CABINET.                  COPY NO .  H&quot;\  CP. 283(36 ).         INCREASE OF THE [JfiER LIMIT OF REMUNERATION        FOR CiMPJLoOilY INSURANCE AGAINST U:a34PLOYM3i;;T.              Memorandom ,b,y the Minister of Health.          I am  afraid I cannot view the proposal of the Minister of Labour to  raise the remuneration limit for unemployment insurance of  non-manual workers to  400 a year without serious misgivings  as to  the repercussions of  such a step on the Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Schemes.          The Government&apos;s Election Manifesto last year announced the definite intention of providing a voluntary scheme of insurance  for  pensions for the black-coated worker, and it is taken as a  matter of course that this  pledge will have to be redeemed.   It  is for this reason that I have put forward the scheme set  forth  in my memorandum dated 23rd October (CP.276 (36 )).          If  it were now to be announced that these olack-coatedworkers were  to be brought compulsorily into unemployment insurance I fear that it would be practically impossible to proceed with the scheme for voluntary insurance.   It would, I fear, be difficult to justify making the insured person pay himself the whole of the contribution  for  pensions while one-half of the unemployment insurance contribution was paid by the employer.   Moreover the deduction from the workerTs wages of his share of the unemployment insurance contribution might just turn the scales in his decision on the question of paying the suggested contribution of Is.3d. aweek for pensions insurance.          In  these circumstances I suggest that we should proceedfirst with  the scheme of voluntary insurance for pensions anddefer for the present a decision on the extension of unemploymentinsurance.          This would have the further advantage of providing a useful means  of testing in practice the desire of the black-coated
    workers for inclusion in further schemes of social insurance    which, with all respect to Sir W. Beveridge1s Committee,  is    today largely a matter of conjecture.    There would still be    time after the response to the voluntary scheme had been    ascertained to extend unemployment insurance  in the lifetime    this Parliament if it then seemed desirable to do so.                                      (Intld.)  K.W.October 26th, 1936.
