     THIS DOCUI.ENT IS TIIS EB0EB3TY 0? KIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S G0VBH1TOT.(36)                        CABINET.                   COPY NO.           RECRUITING FOR THE AMY AND THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR.                Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.  1.   In making ray comments on  the memorandum (c.P.522(36)) by the Secretary  of State for War, on the subject of recruiting for the &apos;Army,  I should in  the first place  like to make it clear that I approach the problem which  the Secretary of State raises  with the greatest possible sympathy and with a  full realisation of the gravity of tiie situation which he describes.   If I  dissent from one or two of his proposals, I should like my colleagues to  understand that  I do this because in the light of the knowledge of the labour  situation possessed by my Department, I believe that the proposals which I  criticise would  not help recruiting and would, by a confusion of purpose, tend  to impair the efficiency of the Employment Exchange machinery, the maintenance  of which at the  moment is vital for the supply of workers for the defence  programme.  2.   The increasing shortage of skilled men, particularly for the engineering  and shipbuilding trades, is causing considerable anxiety to the Minister for  Co-ordination of Defence, to the Service Departments and myself.   It would,  I think, be generally agreed that it v/ould be disastrous to take any step  which would lessen the power of my Department to help in an emergency which  is already taxing its resources to the utmost.  3.   I agree with the Secretary of State that conscription is at the present  moment outside the sphere of practical politics and that it would in any case  be difficult to  introduce until every possible step had been taken to make  the voluntary system produce the results required.   I find myself in  substantial agreement also with him on many of the steps he suggests should be  taken to promote voluntary recruitment.   In particular I believe that the  most effective and essential measure is the guarantee of employment for ex-  regulars to the  greatest possible extent, by a combination of an ear-marking  of jobs and a judicious system of training the nature of which I shall be  happy to discuss.   Some of his proposals seem to me, however, to approach  the matter from  the wrong angle.   I do not propose to examine and comment upon  all his suggestions in this memorandum, but I shall be happy to do so and to offer
some constructive proposals myself, particularly in reference to pacifistpropaganda, if the general inquiry which I suggest later in this memorandum is approved.4.   For the present I should like to examine and dispose of one of his proposals upon which I think there is a good deal of misunderstanding, thatis the proposal that the officials of Employment Exchanges should be instructed to take the initiative in suggesting to those who register forwork and who seem suitable the possibility of joining the Army.5.   I cannot help  suspecting that this propose!  has its origin, in partat any rate, in the mistaken idea that amongst the unemployed at theExchanges is a large number of young men, potential recruits, who remain outof work all the year round, and are content to live upon unemployment benefit or assistance.6.   Statistics taken out last May show that the number of young men betweenthe ages of 18 and 25 who were then registered at Employment Exchanges inGreat Britain was approximately 229,000.   Three-quarters of those between the ages of 18: and 20 have been unemployed for less than three months andproDably two-thirds of those between the ages of 21 and 25 have been umemployed for similar periods.   The total number, therefore, whose periods ofunemployment did not exceed three months was 158,000, and of these the greatmajority had been unemployed for less than six weeks.   It is also estimatedthat of the 229,000 the number who had been unemployed for a year or more wasonly 32,000.   All these figures must have fallen since May owing to thecontinued improvement in employment.7.   The field, therefore, so far as the unemployed are concerned is not so large,  even assuming that they are all up to the required physical standard,as the crude unemployment figures might lead one to suppose.   The question is whether the Exchanges can help to tap this limited source in the manner suggested;   I think not.
8.   The normal practice oi&apos; the Exchanges is to offer jobs to unemployed menand to suspend payment of benefit if the job is technically &quot;suitable&quot;  andis refused.   It is only where the job is not regarded as &quot;suitable&quot;  that a refusal is not followed by suspension of benefit.9.   There would be no power to suspend benefit if service in the Army  were suggested to a man by the Exchanges and were refused;  and to take such power would be to introduce conscription by a back door, a coarse which I do  notsuppose would commend itself to my colleagues.    It would follow, therefore,that such service would be put on the level of an &quot;unsuitable job&quot;, so  faras benefit is concerned, and the unemployed men would soon realise that no attention need be paid by them to any suggestions by the Exchanges that they should join the Army.10.  On the other hand our political opponents would wish for nothing betterthan to be given such an opportunity of alleging that the new arrangements are &apos;a form of veiled conscription.   The Exchanges would thus become  involved inan acute political controversy which would certainly not help recruiting but which would seriously impair the ability of the Exchanges to supply the laboururgently needed for the defence programme,11.  Equally strong objections apply to the proposal that recruiting  officers should be given the right of entry to Instructional and Training  Centres.Recruitment for these centres is voluntary and meets with many difficulties, some of which are due to political propaganda against the centres.   Admissionof recruiting officers to the centres would give this propaganda  just thematerial which it requires and the result,  I am convinced, would  be to  make itimpossible to continue the centres,  with anything like the present numbers,  ona voluntary basis.    Compulsion would then have to be contemplated and  would raise a political controversy which would be difficult enough in  any circumstances,  and would be greatly aggravated if linked up, as it would be,with allegations of veiled conscription.12,  The real solution it seems to me is not to involve the Exchanges in workwhich is outside their experience and for which they are not equipped,  but tomake the conditions of service in the Army more attractive, to see that thepeople of this country realise fully the need for imintaining and evenincreasing the size of the Army, and to take more effective steps to  ensure that                                 3.
men discharged from the Army in the prime of life are not thrown on theindustrial scrap-heap.   If we do this, we shall find men asking theExchange Officers more and more for the kind of information about militaryservice which they are already authorised to give and which can be amplifiedin any way that may bo thought desirable.13.  I would suggest for consideration that a small Committee of the cabinet should be set up forthwith to examine into the causes of the comparativefailure to secure recruits for the Army and to make recommendations as to the steps necessary to remove them.   This Committee might base its deliberationsupon the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum and should aim at producing its recommendations before we disperse for Christmas.
