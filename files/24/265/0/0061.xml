)SURVEY  OF  THE  ECONOMIC  SITUATION, DECEMBER  1936.                Part 1. Summary of recent economic events.                                (a) Finance.    THE principal  economic event of recent months has been the devaluationof the  franc, which Avas  followed  by the devaluation of the  Swiss,  Dutch,Italian  and  Czeehoslovakian currencies.  The significance  of  these  changes are discussed in  the  second part  of  this  report.   The  devaluation  of  the franc was accompanied  by declarations in similar terms by the governmentsof the  United  Kingdom,  the  United  States and France,  in which these governments  agreed that  the devaluation of  the  franc should not  in itself be the  occasion of further depreciation  of  their  currencies  by the first twopowers,  undertook  to  co-operate  in  preventing  undue  fluctuations   in  the values of their  currencies,  and  expressed the hope that  the obstacles to  theexpansion of world trade would be reduced.  In Franee devaluation was effected by a series of emergency measures on the 26th September, and was subsequentlyconfirmed by a law of the 1st October, under which the government is authorisedto fix the new  gold  value of the  franc by decree at a level which must  show adepreciation  to between 65 - 6 and 74-8 of its former value.  Gold holdings wererevalued forthwith on the basis of the higher of these figures, and out of the profits of revaluation  an exchange fund  of 10 milliard  francs  was  set up,  to  be administered by the Bank of France, which is required to maintain the value ofthe franc for the time being within  the limits set for its final gold content.  Thelaw also requires that all gold held either at home or abroad by  persons of Frenchdomicile must be sold to the Bank of France at the old parity, or if it is retainedthe owner must  pay a tax  to the  government equal to the increase  in its value.It may  be observed that this provision does not prevent the  development of aprivate  market in  gold in France, as it has been prevented in the  United States.The  Swiss  franc  and  the Dutch  guilder  were also  devalued  after  a littlehesitation.  In the case of the Netherlands no new parity was  prescribed for theguilder,  but  an embargo was placed  on the export of gold except with  theauthority of  the central bank, and an exchange fund on the British model was set up.  The  actual depreciation of the guilder has amounted to 20 per cent.   Inthe case of Switzerland,  the Swiss National Bank was directed to maintain thevalue of the franc at between 66 and 75 per cent, of its old gold value.  TheItalian  lira was devalued by 41  per cent, from its  previous nominal value, andthe de facto depreciation relative to the franc was thus somewhat  increased.   Inaddition,  in  Czechoslovakia, where  the value of the currency  had already beenreduced by 16 per cent, in 1934, there was a further depreciation of by 16 per cent.The Greek, Latvian and Turkish currencies, which had previously been attachedto the franc, are in future to be attached to sterling, though  there has been&apos;no significant change in their values.  An  agreement between  the three  powers concerned in the declarations of the 25th September was subsequently announcedwhereby gold is to be made available from their exchange funds in liquidation of balances accumulated in either of the other two centres.  Switzerland and theNetherlands  have  since  become  parties  to  this agreement, the  importance  ofwhich lies in the fact that it modifies the regulations previously  in force in theUnited  States whereby gold for export could only be made available if consigned to countries operating a gold standard.  Exports of gold from  the United states to Belgium were already permitted under these regulations.   The course of theexchanges in London on New York and Paris is shown in table 1.

As London is the distributing centre for newlymined gold, the  price of gold in the open market is normally rather lower  thanthese official prices.  Making allowance for this the divergence of the exchangesfrom their theoretical gold parity gives some indication of the direction and forceof the movement of funds occurring at these rates of exchange.TABLE 2.Exchange rates and the price of gold since October  1935.Month.

Treasury bill rates remain very stable at a little over one half per cent.,at which level  they have  been  maintained during the whole of 1936, with theexception of a period of higher rates in June.  In that month the stringency ofthe money market often associated with the end of the half year was aggravated by French hoarding of English notes.  The effect of  this hoarding was offset bypurchases of gold by  the Bank in July, and bill  rates relapsed to their  normallevel.   During  the six months up  to  the middle of November the amount of treasury bills outstanding has increased by  71 millions to  826 millions, roughlyin step with the growth of the excess of Government payments over receipts which now amounts to  97^ millions, an increase of  66^  millions in the six months.Since the devaluation of the franc  there has been no  official  price of gold inParis.  The Paris rates of exchange  for September refer to the period up to the25th of that month.    2.  The gold  holdings of the principal central banks are  given in table 3.Up to the end of September the Bank of France was losing gold heavily.  Betweenthe 25th September and  the  2nd Otcober the  Bank  of France&apos;s gold holdingincreased in nominal value by 7-2 milliard francs.  This appears to have been dueto the revaluation of the  gold stock, on the one hand, which added  17 milliardfrancs to its nominal value,  and, on  the other hand,  to the  transfer of gold to the value of 10 milliard francs to the newly constituted exchange fund.  Afterthe 2nd October the Bank of France gained gold to the value of  7 milliard francsunder the provisions of the law requiring the surrender of hoarded gold.  Sincethe 23rd October  there has  been no change in  the  bank&apos;s  gold holding, and presumably current exchange transactions only affect the exchange fund&apos;s holding.Exports of gold to France from Great Britain in the month of October amountedonly to  1 -3 millions, and it may therefore be assumed that very little of the goldknown to be hoarded in London by Frenchmen has, so far,  found its way backto the Bank of France.  Since the suspension of the gold standard in September1931 net imports of gold into this country have amounted to 93-8 million ounces;of this, approximately 26-7  million  ounces have been  added  to the  Bank  ofEngland&apos;s gold stock, and there is a  balance of  67-1 million ounces unaccountedfor.   Information  is not, however, available as to how much of  this gold is helddirectly by foreign hoarders.                                 TABLE 3.

Nevertheless, as a result of the funding operations of last December  andthe first payments on that recently announced the total issues of Treasury billsare  75 millions less than a year ago.  Of the present issue of  826 millions of treasury  bills,  G08 millions  have been issued by  tender  and  218 millions&apos;&quot;through the tap,&quot; the increases in the last six months being  55 millions and 16 millions respectively.   On the 17th November the issue of a further fundingloan was announced.   The loan is for a nominal amount of   100 millions andis issued at a price of  98^ per cent.  The loan bears interest at 2j per cent, andis redeemable in 1952-57.   Of the proceeds some  37-2 millions may be requiredto repay outstanding  issues falling clue  early  next year,  and the balance of 61 - 3 millions will be available  to reduce the floating  debt.  The  terms  of theissue are less favourable to the Treasury than those of the 1\ per cent. Fundingloan issued last year at  96^ per cent.  That issue, however, was largely taken up by public departments  and is now quoted in the market at 93 per cent.    4.   Bank deposits have been  increasing steadily and at   2,202 millions inOctober were  166 or  8-2 per  cent,  greater than a year ago.   The increase indeposits has been made possible by an expansion of  15 millions, or 7-4 per cent.,in the banks&apos; holdings of cash,  which  in October  of this  year  amounted to 219 millions.  The other assets of the banks which have expanded are, in orderof importance,  advances   87 millions,  or  11-2 per  cent,  greater,  discounts 46 millions, or 15-5 per cent, greater, and money at call  14 millions, or  10 percent, greater.  The investments of the banks are practically unchanged, comparedwith a year ago.  The increase in bank advances is, in part, due to the credit of 40 millions to the French Government, largely supplied  by the clearing  banks.This is now falling due for repayment.  Ordinary advances are now expandingfairly rapidly.                                  TABLE 4.

    5.   Stock exchange quotations in Great Britain have shown, on the one hand,great strength on the part of ordinary shares, which, in the middle of November,were 16 per cent, higher than a year earlier, and, on the other hand, a weak and,in some instances, a declining tendency on the part of fixed-interest securities.New issues in the third quarter were somewhat lower than in the second and  thanii  the corresponding quarter of 1935.

From August  to  October  thepercentage of unemployment among insured workers was 11-9 in Great Britainand  12-1 in  the  United Kingdom, or  2-5 per  cent, less  than  in  Octobera  year  ago.   In  a  further  table  (table  9)  we analyse  the  growth  ofemployment  and unemployment  in  different groups  of industries  betweenthe year 1929 and  the years  1935 and 1936.  It will be observed  that everygroup  of industries showed an  increase in employment and a decrease in umemployment in 1936  compared with a year before.  The proportional  increasein employment was greatest in the case of the four groups of investment industries(engineering, &amp;c, 12-9 per cent., iron and  steel  12  per cent., -building and construction 8-8  per cent.,  building  materials 6-3 per cent.); employment in transport increased by 5-6 per cent., and in the other groups from 3 to 4 per cent.The increase in employment in the investment industries amounted to 294,300, and made possible a reduction of  unemployment  of 115,000,  and  new  recruitment of 169,300. In the other groups, the increase in employment amounted to 320,000,and brought about a reduction in unemployment of 218,300 and new recruitment of 101,700. The level of unemployment in the investment industries was 12-9  percent,  in  1936 compared with 11-0 per cent,  in 1929,  and in the other groups12 - 0 per cent, compared with 9 - 5 per cent, in 1929.   Paradoxically, the whole ofthe increase in unemployment since  1929 is  accounted for by those  groups ofindustries which in 1929 were looked upon as sheltered, although these industries have  also been responsible for the whole of the  increase in employment.  the explanation  is to be found in the fact that,  during the  depression, the shelteredindustries, just because of their more favourable experience, attracted labour in larger quantities than  has been justified by  the subsequent expansion ofemployment.   The  percentage of unemployment in the  unsheltered  industrieswas  13-6 in  1936 and 13-1  in 1929.  In the sheltered industries, on the otherhand, unemployment has increased from 8-0 per  cent,  in  1929  to 11-6 per cent.in 1936. -The proportional  expansion of employment  between 1935 and 1936was  about the same in the  southern and midland divisions  of Great britain as in the rest of the United Kingdom, being approximately 5-7 per cent.in both  cases.  In the South  the expansion  of employment of 336,000 caused a reduction  of  unemployment of 101,000,  and new  recruitment of  235,000.In the North the expansion of employment  of 284,000 caused a reduction ofunemployment of 238,000 and new recruitment of only 46,000.  It is obvious thatthe expanding industries in the South and Midlands must  have drawn heavily onthe surplus of labour in the North. The percentage of unemployment in the Southand Midlands was 7 -1 in 1936 compared with 6 - 4 in 1929.  In the North it was18-8 in 1936 compared  with 13-2 in 1929.

According to the Board  of Trade index,  industrial  production in thethird quarter of 1936, at 121-7 per cent, of the 1930 average was 1 per cent, lessthan in the second quarter and 9-9 per cent, more than in the third quarter of1935.  There is normally a seasonal decline in the index in the third quarter ofthe year.  The iron and steel industries and the engineering and shipbuilding industries continued to show the greatest expansion in comparison with 1935; but every group of industries showed  a substantial improvement.

They remain, however, very high and are consistent with a continuation of great house building activity for some months to come.  The October figuresfor new plans passed.for dwelling houses was  17  per  cent,  lower than a yearago.  Plans passed for  other buildings in the third quarter  remained near the peak level reached in the second quarter, and the October figure was approximately equal to that of a year ago.    10.  The  domestic absorption of steel continues at  an  extremely high level,averaging 902 thousand tons a month in the six months ending with this Octobercompared with 718 thousand tons  in  the  corresponding  six months of 1935.Imports in the last six months have averaged 22 thousand tons more than a year before,  and exports about  11  thousand tons less.  Production has shown  anaverage increase  over last year of 151 thousand tons,  and in October reached1,060 thousand tons, the highest figure  ever recorded.

Retail trade  in  October showed  a substantial improvement both overOctober  a year ago, and over September.  The improvement over  September Avaslargely but by no  means  wholly of a  seasonal nature.  An interesting feature of the  October  trade is the substantial  improvement in the  Sales  of &quot;othermerchandise,&quot; i.e.,  all goods except food and perishables.  Hitherto the expansionof retail trade this year has been largely accounted for by foodstuffs,  and hasbeen in part a reflection of their higher prices.

The  Federal  Reserve Board&apos;s  index of  production  averaged 95 per cent, of the 1923-25 level  in the  first quarter,102 per cent, in the second quarter, and 108 per cent, in the third quarter.  even at  its  October  level of  109 per cent., the index is still substantially  below theaverage for the year 1929,  which was 119  per cent., but it  is already almost atthe average level for 1928, namely 111 per cent., and if the present rate of progress is maintained, it should not be long before the 1929 level is reached and surpassed.Factory employment is not expanding as fast as production; employment in thethird quarter this year was 9 per cent, greater than a year before.   But therehas been an increase of about 7 per cent, in the number of hours worked in theweek since a year ago.   Retail  trade has shown a considerable increase since  ayear ago,  department store sales being 11^ per cent, and chain store sales 13  percent, greater in the third quarter of 1936 than in the same quarter of 1935.  Thus,although  the improvement in productive activity in the United States has been most marked in the industries producing durable goods largely for the  expansionof capital equipment, it is supported by an expansion of consumers&apos; demand.

More recent changes in the level of business activity in the United States.are indicated by the index published by the New York Times, which summarises the results of a number of series of important statistics.  The movements of thisindex since September are given in the following table.  The index is supposed to represent the level of activity as a percentage of an assumed  normal, which isadjusted both for seasonal variations and for longer trends.  It appears likelyfrom this index that there was little change between  September  and October, butthat there was a  further sharp improvement in November.f

As is natural, having regard to the building boom which was  such amarked feature of the years preceding the depression, constructional activity still remains  relatively the most depressed section of American economic  activity.Nevertheless,  the revival which began in  residential building  in the  second quarter of 1935 is gathering strength, and  there is an improvement in the other classes of building activity.  &apos; The average monthly value of all building contractsawarded in the last six months reached about 45 per cent, of the value in  the peakyear of 1928.

Wholesale prices of raw materials have been rising more rapidly and
have more than made good the decline which occurred between February  andMay of this year.  Since the devaluation of the  franc the value of sterling has fallen nearly to the level prevailing in the first part of 1935, thus bringing Britishprices more nearly into line with American.  The rise in the comparable Britishprices since the first quarter of 1933 and the first  quarter of 1935 respectively areas follows : wages, 4 - 3 per cent, and 4 per cent.; raw materials at  wholesale,15-7 per cent,  and  9-7  per  cent.;  retail  food  prices,  14-3 per  cent,  and11-9 per cent.

American stock prices continue their strong upward movement, the-Dow Jones index being more than 10 per cent, higher at the end of Novemberthan at the end of August.  Bond prices are also higher.  The American Treasuryhas published an investigation bearing upon the inflow of foreign funds into theUnited States.  According to these,  the total inflow of funds in the  first nine months of the year amounted to 2,282 million dollars, of which 780 million dollarscame from the United Kingdom.  It is further estimated that of this total thenet inflow of short-term banking funds was 1,353 million dollars, the net increaseof brokers&apos; balances was 23 million dollars, and the net inflow of. funds in respectof security transactions was 905 million dollars.  Of the latter figure 633 million dollars represented net purchases of American securities and 272 million dollarsnet purchases of  foreign  securities.  Moreover,  it  is  estimated  that the netpurchases of securities by the United Kingdom amounted to 342 million  dollars.It is clear that this inflow of  capital must have had an important influence on the:course  of stock prices in America.

The French index of production which in April and May was approxi-mately 10 per cent, higher than a year earlier, at 102 per cent,  of the 1913 level,declined to 98 per cent, in June and July, and  to 93 per cent, in  August, at whichpoint it was equal to that for a year  earlier.   In September the index rose to 95.The decline in the French industrial  index is no doubt largely a reflection of the interruption of production  caused by the strike epidemic,  which  began in June;for it is pointed out that the French index being largely based on the consumptionof materials is liable to distortion from month to  month by the accumulation ordissipation  of stocks.  The indices of employment have shown no such violentchanges.  They show only a moderate improvement between May 1935  and May1936,  and no decline in activity since that month.

     18.  There has been  a substantial rise in French prices, which were about35 per cent, higher in October than a year ago.   Up to May of this year the rise inprices was confined to foodstuffs, and since May industrial products also have been rising. Before September the rise in prices was greatest in home-produced goods,the rise  in prices of imported goods  being moderate.  Since devaluation therehas naturally been  a sharp rise in the price of imported products.  Devaluationalso had an  immediate effect upon the prices of ordinary  shares,  the index ofwhich, having  fallen from 193 in April to 137 in August, rose again to 190 inOctober.  Government securities  have also improved;  3 per cent, rentes, whichhad fallen  to 65 in September, rose to 81 on the 8th October, but have subsequentlyreacted to  77.  The improvement  in security prices was assisted by the reductionin the Bank of France&apos;s rate of discount,  which since the 15th October has stood at 2 per cent.                                (e) Germany.     19.  Production  in Germany continues to expand, and unemployment  hasbeen reduced to extremely small proportions.   The percentage of unemploymentappears to be about 6 per cent., a figure which  in Great Britain at any rate would now be regarded as the minimum consistent with the maintenance of the necessaryfluidity in  the labour market.  Hours of work have also increased from 7 - 44 hours a day  in September a year ago to 7-62 hours this September.  A few industries,however, are still  working  fewer  hours  than are  normal,  notably the  textileclothing and the beer and tobacco industries.   A feature of the production indexin recent months has been the improvement in the position of the consumers&apos; goodsindustries.  In  1935 the expansion of production in the investment industries wasin part  at the expense of production in consumers&apos; goods  industries,  largely because in  the  circumstances of  the time  the  resources available  for purchasingraw materials  were insufficient  to  maintain  full activity in both branches  ofproduction.  The measures since taken to maintain and improve  export  trade have borne substantial  fruit, and the volume of  imports of raw materials into germany, though still low in comparison with 1929,  is materially greater than ayear ago.  The result has been that  the  improvement in demand  arising, from increasing  activity  in the investment  industries has  carried with it this year, asit could not in 1935, a substantial improvement in output in the consumers&apos;  goods.industries. Nevertheless, supplies of raw materials still appear to be insufficient,and stocks  are so small that production is sometimes seriously interfered with.    20.  The food situation in  Germany  is still  unsatisfactory.   Last yearconsumption  of cereals was in  excess of  production plus  imports, and inroadswere made into stocks, which at the end of the cereal year were half or less thana year earlier.  This year&apos;s harvest  has not been very much better than that of ayear ago, and, of course, it will be impossible this year to supplement consumption by drawing on  stocks to the same extent as a  year ago.  Moreover, demands  forfodder are likely to be greater this year, as  the livestock population has been increased at  the expense of meat consumption, by limiting the slaughtering of animals.    21.  In  the course of the  current year a certain  number of  fundingoperations  have been undertaken by the German Government.  The total valueof consolidation loans issued since 1935 amounts to 4,030 million reichsmarks, ofwhich approximately 2,400 million reichsmarks have been issued this year.  Theprocess of  consolidation has not  been easy; the last operation undertaken this autumn resulted in a sharp advance in interest rates, due apparently to the factthat the new loan appealed principally to financial institutions, who  withdrewmoney from the market to buy it, whereas the floating debt redeemed was in the possession  of industrial organisations, who were not prepared to accept the lowrates offering in the money market for the funds at their disposal through  theredemption of debt.  The  principle  hitherto underlying German finance has been to allow the  increased demand resulting from government expenditure to  resultin increased profits to industrialists, but to prevent these profits from accruing asincome to individuals by limiting the  rates of  dividend permitted.   Owing to theprohibition of  new industrial issues,  these undistributed profits necessarily find their way into the market for government issues.  This procedure bears consider-able similarity to the system of  taxing excess profits in  force in this country during the war, and the resemblance is increased by the recent decision to double the rate of the  corporation tax, which is levied on all profits whether distributedor not.  The principal indices of German economic activity are reproduced intable 19.

The quantum of world trade in thesecond quarter of 1936 was slightly lower than in the first, but was 3-1 per cent.higher than  in the second quarter of 1935.   The figures given are exclusive ofItaly  in  the years 1935 and 1936.  The gold value of world trade  was 10-4 percent, higher in the third quarter of 1936 than in the same quarter of 1935, butthe greater part of this increase is probably due to rising prices.

After comparative stagnation in the first half of 1936 British exports have shown renewed signs of expansion since July.   Exports in the first ten months of 1936 amounted to  361 - 8 millions, an increase of  10 - 0 millions over1935.  Re-exports at  50-0 millions are  4-7 millions greater, and imports at 688 -1 millions,  75 - 7 millions greater.   There is thus an increase in the adverse balance of trade of  60-9  millions in  the first ten months.  The percentageexpansion of British exports in comparison with the corresponding month of theprevious year is shown in  the following  table                                    TABLE 21.The monthly increase in British exports since January 1934 as a percentage of         the exports in the corresponding months in the previous year.JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember1934.	1935.	1936.

                Part 2. The economic situation, December 1936.        (a) Devaluation in the gold bloc and the prospects of world trade.     26.  The devaluation of the gold bloc currencies has generally and rightly been regarded as opening a new phase in international economic relations;  and it must affect the position of this country at a number of points.  In the first place, there will be certain direct reactions on the prospects of British  trade.  There have already been important consequences in the monetary sphere, and there will be more.  Finally, there is the possibility that as a consequence of devaluation there may be some improvement in the conditions under which international trade is conducted.   But  the devaluation in the gold  bloc, though  it is the principal, is not the only factor affecting British trade at the present time.  The rise in the prices  of raw  materials and of  cereals is likely to be  of growing  importance. Moreover, the  strain placed by  rearmament programmes throughout the world on the capacity of the engineering industry is  a new and important element in the world economic  situation.     (b) The effect of devaluation on the position of British foreign trade.     27.  We may begin our discussion  with a survey of the present position of British foreign trade and the other factors entering into the balance of payments and the  probable repercussions upon them  of the devaluation of  the gold  bloc currencies.  We do not wish, however, to suggest either that these can be estimated with any high  degree of accuracy, or that, even if they could, the avoidance of an adverse balance of payments is in present circumstances a necessary objective of British policy.   In 1935, for  the first  time  since 1930, the Board of  Trade estimated that our balance of payments  showed  a substantial surplus, amounting to  37 millions.  But this  surplus was the  consequence of a number of special circumstances, and if adjustment is made for these, it seems likely that there was not much change in the underlying conditions between 1933, 1934 and 1935,  and that they were such as  to  produce,  upon the Board of Trade&apos;s calculations,  a favourable balance in the neighbourhood of   10 millions a year.  This year the visible  balance of trade alone seems likely to be between some  60 and  70 millions worse than last year; and though the invisible items in the balance of payments will show an improvement, this will  hardly be  great enough  to prevent a small adverse balance of payments.     28.  Some  elements in  the  increased adverse balance of trade are of an entirely normal character.  We have imported more foodstuffs, raw materials and semi-manufactured goods this year than last because industrial activity and home consumption have been greater.  Moreover, under the influence of widening world activity, and in some cases of diminished supply,  the prices of the goods we import have been rising faster than those of  the goods we export. But we do not think that these changes  alone can  account for the  deterioration  in  the balance of payments.  They should have  been  offset by increased exports,  by increased commissions  and shipping  receipts and by  increased yields  from  our overseas investments.   There have been two special factors at work to prevent this result. The first  is the  strain on the capacity of our iron and steel, and, even more,  our engineering industries, which has come about through the conjunction of a strong home demand for building and for industrial equipment with the special demand arising  from  the government&apos;s rearmament  programme.   During  the last few7 years these industries have made a rapidly expanding contribution  to the credit of our balance of payments; exports less retained imports of the goods concerned amounted to   67-4  millions  in 1933,  to   74-3 millions  in 1934,  and to  85-1 millions in 1935.  This year, on  the other hand,  net exports  in the firsteleven  months  of the year  amounted  to  only   74-9 millions compared with  79-2 millions in 1935.  The other factor to which we attach importance is the check which the expansion of our other exports received in the first six months of the year,  a check which may be attributed in part to a  slight overvaluation of sterling.    29.   For the immediate future we must recognise that the adverse influence of the first of these factors, the pressure  on the capacity of the heavy industries,is  likely to be accentuated.  For the full force of the government&apos;^ rearmament
 programme has not yet been felt, and there is no reason to suppose that the other elements in home demand will show any serious falling off.   If, therefore, any appreciable improvement in our balance of payments is to be achieved, it must come through  an improvement in the overseas demand for the  products  of the industries not subject  to this strain.  It  is  to  be observed that as far  as the competitive position  of these industries is concerned the recent changes  in the relative valuation of the three major currencies will be by no means a helpful development.   The pound has  become cheaper in terms of dollars, but dearer in terms of francs.   But whereas the appreciation of the pound in terms of  francs will work to the detriment  of  the industries in which we still have considerable capacity available for use in the export trade, the advantages of the depreciation of the pound in terms of dollars will accrue mainly to those industries which have already little capacity to spare for exports.  For American competition is of little or no importance in, for example, the textile trades.  Moreover, the changes in tourist  traffic  which  will be induced by the gold bloc devaluations  are likely to work out to the disadvantage of this country.  If, therefore, Great Britain is to benefit  from the recent  alignment of currencies it must be because of the indirect effects of this alignment in improving overseas demand for British goods.     30. One of the hoped for effects of the devaluation of the franc and the other currencies of the gold bloc is the improvement which  it may bring with it  in the internal markets  of  the countries  concerned.   This,  if  it comes, will  call for increased supplies of raw materials and foodstuffs from abroad, and will increase the purchasing power  of the  primary producing countries.   In view of their improved  competititive position a great part  of  this  new demand will  no doubt be directed  towards France and the other gold  bloc  countries, but it  is  by  no means impossible that Great Britain will share in it.  In default of any improve- ment in their internal situation, the repercussions of  the devaluations on  Great Britain will  probably be unfavourable;  for we  shall suffer from the effects of greater  French competition  abroad and indeed at home, and as we have seen the slight improvement in  our  position  vis-a-vis  the United States  is not likely to bring us any material benefits.  The anticipation that devaluation in France  would be associated with internal recovery  was largely based  upon the view that the return flow of capital to France would create conditions of great financial ease in that country, and would thus promote the expansion of trade.  To some extent this has already occurred.  The Bank of France has regained substantial quantities of gold, and has been able to reduce its rate of rediscount to 2 per cent.  But for a number of reasons the main flow of capital to France has not yet begun.  The repatriation of French gold  hoarded abroad has been obstructed by the provisions of the devaluation law, which prevent a profit being  secured thereby.  The fact that under the devaluation law a considerable margin for further devaluation has been allowed, has encouraged the belief that by holding back, speculators will be able to  secure  better terms for themselves.  This expectation has  been  given greater  plausibility  both by the confused state of French domestic  politics and by the  unsatisfactory position of  the 1937  budget,  which in  view of  heavy appropriations for defence  and public works, is still expected to show a very considerable deficit, even after allowing for  a substantial improvement in receipts. None the less, there has already been a noticeable improvement in some  branches of French activity. In  other countries of the  gold bloc the prospects of internal improvement are not clouded by the same difficulties.    31.   Whether the devaluation of the franc on the whole assists British trademust depend on the development of the internal situation in France.  Its beneficial results can scarcely be expected to begin before the return flow  of French capital gathers  strength, and, even then, the condition of  its assisting this country is that it.shall in some  part be repatriated in the form of goods rather than gold.  Bearing in mind the adverse influence which intensive rearmament is. in any case  likely to exert on the balance of payments, it seems reasonable to conclude that during the next few years this country is likely to be confronted with an  increasingly adverse  balance of payments on income account, which may possibly become con- siderable.   Within limits, however, this result is  not altogether to be deprecated. For one  thing, it is desirable to prevent the rearmament programme from bringing about an excessive expansion in the  industries specially affected, and this canmost easily be achieved by drawing some part of the supplies required from abroad. Moreover, we are of opinion that one of the necessary conditions for the improve-
merit of international trade is a readiness on the part of those countries who can afford it to acquiesce in an adverse balance of payments.   This leads us to theconsideration of the monetary aspects of devaluation.                   (c) The monetary aspects of devaluation.     32.  From the monetary point of view the devaluation  of the franc and theother currencies which  in  1933 were covered by the declaration of the gold blocpowers  at  the  International  Economic  Conference, has  two  advantages,  onenegative and  one positive.  First, the danger  that  these  currencies might  be increasingly subjected to a system of exchange regulation on the German modelhas disappeared.  Secondly, a more positive advantage  arises from the readjust-ment of their external values to levels more in keeping with their domestic values.Since the outbreak of the slump the mechanism of the foreign exchange marketshas been overwhelmed by the movements of great masses of short-term capital fromone centre to another in search of security against the possibility of loss followingdepreciation.  These  movements have been primarily responsible for  the settingup  of exchange funds and the use of  other devices in  every important  country which  has maintained  a free  exchange  system,  with  the  object of insulating-domestic money markets from the inflationary or deflationary effect which, underthe old gold standard, would have been entailed.  One result of this new techniquehas been the immobilisation of great quantities of gold; for the countries in whichthis short-term capital found refuge could not, and cannot yet be sure how muchof this might  ultimately be withdrawn, and tended accordingly to maintain  fullreserves of gold  against this contingency.  There is now  a hope that with theestablishment  of more appropriate relationships between the major currencies ofthe world these movements  of short-term capital will disappear, and that the goldwhich  has  been  held  against their occurrence will  become  available  formonetary use.     33.  There is, however, one possibility which may impede this favourabledevelopment, namely,  the further growth of the movement of international capitalbetween different security markets. Hitherto this has been on a less substantial scale than the movement of short-term funds, although the prospect of a stock exchangeboom in the United States has already  attracted  great quantities of Europeancapital to America, as it did before 1929. It is becoming increasingly plain thatthe  great variability of American security values  has introduced a new  anddisturbing element into international financial life.  In so far as the range offluctuation in the value of ordinary shares in the United States is expected to exceed that in Great Britain,  France  and other European countries,  there is atendency for investors to transfer their capital to America so  long as there  is ageneral expectation that  prices will  rise,  and to repatriate  them when  it isexpected that  prices will fall.  At the moment this cyclical  ebb  and flow of fundsis likely to be subordinate  to the effect which anticipations of preventive actionon  the part of the American authorities may have on the actions of investors,and for that reason we think that a temporary outflow  of capital from america is a possibility to be reckoned with.  Nevertheless, whatever  their direction, greatmovements of capital not only give rise to a number of difficult problems in the sphere of domestic financial policy, but prevent the exchanges  from  respondingreadily to the comparatively small movements of  funds attributable to  changesin the balances of payments of different countries.     34.  The  inward flow  of long-term capital into the United States began in1931 and, after  an interruption in 1933, gathered force  in the last few years.  Itarose in the first place from the repurchase by nationals of the countries concerned of loans floated in the United States during the boom years of the  twenties,  and only more recently has it taken the form of purchase by British and  continentalinvestors of American stock exchange securities.  Throughout this  period theUnited States has maintained a  favourable  balance  of  payments  on  current account, though lately on a considerably diminished scale.   It has followed thatthe United States has been piling up short-term claims abroad, which have been generally satisfied by the import of gold.  The movement of gold to America underthe influence of long-term  capital imports has been, with the immobilisation ofgold held against refugee  capital, an important  influence preventing the  very       [14225]                                                      E
great increase in the world&apos;s supplies of monetary gold since 1931 from having itsnatural effect in improving the financial position of the smaller countries.    35.  In this  respect it is interesting to contrast  the position of the sterling-area with that of the rest of the world.   It was one of the factors contributingmost strongly to the expansion of trade within the sterling area that in.the year1932 the members of the sterling area were enabled to replenish their balances of sterling in London, partly because this country maintained a substantial adverse balance of  payments at a time when the balance of payments of the sterling area as a whole was very favourable, and partly by reason  of the dispersion by india of part of  her hoards of gold.  The less  important countries outside the sterling area have  at  no  time benefited from  a  refreshing stream  of foreign exchange resources;  and it is largely for this reason that in spite of an improvement in their trade position, there has been no relaxation in  the  strictness with  which theyadminister their exchange controls.  It is to be hoped that the devaluation of the franc, associated as it  may be with a dispersion of  some part of the gold nowimmobilised  against  refugee  capital,  will  not only  create conditions of greatexchange ease in the devaluing countries themselves,  but may also alleviate theposition of a great many other countries now suffering from a shortage of gold andforeign exchange.   If, however, this  hope  is to be  realised, there must be a willingness on the part of the countries whose supplies of gold are great, or whosecurrency is willingly accepted as a medium of  foreign trade, to incur an adverse balance of  payments on current account.  This is true of this country, and it isfor that reason that we believe that it  is important that we  should not be undulydisturbed by the prospective  deficit on our balance of payments.  It will equallybe true of France, as  soon  as  the  return  flow  of capital achieves substantialproportions.   But it is true most of all  of the United States,  and it is for that reason greatly to be hoped that whatever course the flow of capital may take, theAmerican  authorities will pursue an  exchange policy which will facilitate thedispersion  of some part of their great  reserves of gold.                          (d) Raw material prices.    36.  The dispersion  of gold and  foreign  exchange reserves throughout theworld is likely to be assisted by the rise which is taking place in industrial rawmaterial prices.  Trade in raw materials reached its lowest ebb in  1932; since then  there has been, in  volume at least, a steady  increase.   The  increase in demand has naturally led to  an improvement in prices.  This tendency has beenassisted in a number of instances by the restrictions placed on the production ofraw materials, and by  the gradual  disappearance of the surplus stocks  of rawmaterials, as they passed into consumption or were absorbed in the growing stocksof half-manufactured goods which is an inevitable feature  of  greater industrial activity.  Production of  raw materials, which declined almost  by 30 per cent.between  1929 and 1932, is now again  approaching the level of the former year,and as this position is reached it is natural that the relative decline in the pricesof raw materials should disappear.  It is interesting to contrast the position ofindustrial raw materials with that of foodstuffs, which have borne the full bruntof  agrarian  protectionism  in  Europe.   In  their  case  world  production has remained more or less stationary throughout the depression, but  the quantum of world trade declined up to 1934, and, though there was a small increase in 1935,this was mainly  due to special  conditions in the United  States following the drought of 1934.    37.  The improvement in the demand for raw materials has taken place at atime  when  a large part &apos;of  Western Europe has  been suffering  from  severedepression.   In France, for  example,  the volume of raw material imports thisyear,  though 12 per cent, greater than last year, is still 13 per cent, lower thanin 1929, whereas in the United  Kingdom they are now 19 per  cent, more thanin 1929. If now there is a substantial revival of industrial activity in the goldbloc countries the demand for raw materials will benefit accordingly.  It is very unlikely, therefore, that the rise in raw material prices has reached  its end.  Ifworld industrial activity continues to expand, the present capacity of the primaryproducing  countries to  provide the necessary raw materials may even be  subjectto some strain.

The foregoing table, therefore, understates the concentration of goldin their  hands, since the beginning  of the  last depression.   It may, therefore,be anticipated that  in the event of a substantial improvement in their tradingposition,  the  primary  producing  countries  will  use  some  of their increasedresources to strengthen their reserves  of gold, and that not all of this increase willreturn to the industrial countries in the form of increased demand for industrialexports.   It  may  be observed that such  a development will  aggravate thedifficulties in  the way of securing raw materials of those countries who have noreserves of gold and whose currencies have not an international status.     39.  Another consequence of increasing  raw material prices will follow  fromthe shift in the balance of prosperity within primary producing countries them-selves.  The industries  established  during  the  crisis will be maintained, butfurther industrialisation will become relatively less profitable  and the expansionof raw material production for export more profitable.   This tendency is likelyto be assisted  by the growing financial security of the primary producers.  Thegreater demand for staple manufactured  goods  from  primary producers  is,therefore, likely to  be  satisfied to some extent by imported  goods.  We  may,therefore, see  a temporary revival in the exports of our older staple industries, inspite of their  secular tendency to decline.     40.  Of great importance to this country is the question whether the rise inraw material  prices will reach such  dimensions as to affect the stability of ourinternal price structure.  In so far as raw material prices enter into the cost ofliving, it may be anticipated that their rise will promote an agitation for higher wages, and that this in turn will give rise to a further rise in the cost of living.In this way the vicious circle of rising prices might be set in motion,  and thewhole structure of costs might come to depend upon an anticipation of perpetuallyincreasing prices.   The influence of raw material prices on the cost of living is,however, of less importance than that of the prices of  foodstuffs; and havingregard to the  important part which  rent  and charges of  a comparatively rigidnature, such,  for example,  as those  for lighting,  transport and entertainment,play in the total expenditure of the  wage-earning  classes, it  is probable that acomparatively  large  rise in the price of raw materials  might  occur,  withoutcreating a general demand for higher wages.   The position, however, is different       [14225]                                                     E  2    38.  One important  consequence  of this change is  that it  will assist  theprocess of  dissipating the surplus of  monetary gold, which  is now  held almost exclusively by  industrial countries.   The  published reserves  of gold  held by central banks and governments now amount to approximately  4,440 millions atthe present price of gold, compared with approximately  2,100 millions in 1929at the  old price.  They are distributed as follows : 
                                      28 in so far as foodstuffs are concerned, and rising prices in this field are likely to react  immediately upon the cost of living.  The retail cost of foodstuffs  is, according to  the Ministry of Lahour&apos;s cost  of living index, approximately 4 per  cent, higher than a year ago.   This increase  is accounted for in part  by the rise in the prices of cereals brought  about by the cumulative effect of three subnormal harvests, and is to that extent likely&apos; to  diminish next year if more normal crops are harvested in the current season.  The rise in costs, however, is not confined to those  directly affected by  the  cereal harvest.   In view of the specially unsatisfactory position of international trade  in  foodstuffs, there are large potential reserves of comparatively low cost production, recourse  to which is open  to us for the  purpose of preventing an  undesirable rise in the cost  of living.   &apos;The effects of rising  raw material prices will not be seriously felt  if adequate use is made  of these reserves in the case of foodstuffs.                    (e)  The outlook for international trade.    41.   The situation as we have described it above obviously  includes certain factors which augur well for the future of world trade.   There is, in the first place,  the prospect of  greater monetary ease which will follow from the adjust- ment of the external value of a number of currencies to a level more in keeping with  their internal value.  There is the possibility of  the  release  of  large quantities of gold  previously immobilised  by  the  fear of large-scale capital movements as soon as these capital movements are completed.  There is  the hope that the recovery of raw material prices  will lead to the dispersion of this gold among  those  countries  which  are suffering most  from exchange stringency. Finally,  there is the possibility that the rising trend  of raw material prices, and the fear of increases in the cost of living may lead to  a greater willingness on the part of industrial countries to accept larger imports of foodstuffs, and on the part of primary producers to accept larger imports of staple  manufactured goods. There  are, indeed, considerations  on the other side, namely, the  danger that the value of sterling in  terms of dollars may be held at  an artificial point, and the magnetic attraction which a rising market in Wall Street exercises upon European funds.   But the  helpful elements in the situation certainly predominate. The question arises whether the forces now released making for the expansion of world trade are likely  to  be  of  sufficient strength to overcome  the resistance to  its expansion which comes from the regulation and restriction of trade in practically every country of the world.    42.   The  great  depression of international trade has been the effect of two sets of causes.  In the first place,  there was the  breakdown of the fundamentally unstable distribution of purchasing power which had become established in the twenties, a distribution based, on the one hand, on a flow of borrowed money from the United States and Great Britain to the British Dominions, to South America,and to Central and  South-Eastern Europe, and on the other hand, on  an over-valuation of sterling, which prevented the development of new export trades fromthis country and the other members of the  sterling  group, at a time when the olderexports of this group were becoming of relatively less importance through changes in the nature of demand, or were depressed by the growth of competing industrieselsewhere. In the second  place, the disturbance caused as the extent  of thesemaladjustments became obvious led to an international financial crisis, which gave rise to all those restrictions upon the movements of goods and funds with whichwe have become familiar.   The improvement which  we now hope for in world trade would be based  on the relief of international financial  stringency, as a consequence of the revaluation of gold in  terms of the great majority of  national currencies.  But even on the most optimistic view, it  is unlikely that world trade will fully recover the position which it held in 1929,  for at  that time the volumeof trade was being artificially enhanced by the foreign lending then taking place.    43.   There is, however, reason to fear  that, though  the  majority of therestrictions and regulations which now impede world trade were imposed as crisismeasures, they will not easily disappear when  the  crisis  passes.  restrictions were imposed in the first  instance with  the  object either of creating new and maintaining  established industries, in the face  of  foreign competition, or  of protecting the exchanges against a drain of funds abroad.   They took the formfirst of increased  tariff protection; secondly, when these proved inadequate,  Of
quantitative limitation of imports; and, finally, of complete exchange control andthe supervision of foreign trade by the State.   In this last phase the mechanismof control proved itself  capable of adaptation to another use, the maintenanceof export trade;  and there has been a growing dependence of export trade on thepower of the  State, in  which control over imports  is now vested in so  many countries, to enter into  agreements whereby  each import  transaction is  made conditional on an equivalent export transaction.    44.  In these circumstances the adaptation of internal  prices to the generalworld level is no longer a necessary condition of exporting.  The State authority,by the control  of the rate at which import and export transactions take placecan arrange for industries with uncompetitive  costs to be supported by industries which are strongly placed.  We may quote the practice of certain South american countries whereby the exchange derived from the  trade in certain staple productshas to be surrendered at the less favourable  official rate of exchange, whereasthat derived from new exports, which it is desired to encourage, may be disposedof more favourably in  the  unofficial market;  and  a similar discrimination ispractised in the case of imports, those which it is desired to favour being in this case given the  advantage of the official rate.   Another example of the growingdifferences between the value of  a single thing according to  its use is to be foundin the value of the German mark in trade with different  countries.   &quot; Aski &quot;marks with which most  German purchases are made in South America stand ata different and varying  discount,  according to the state of  the German balanceof payments with each  separate country.  Under  these conditions world tradeis being progressively canalised under the influence of the special  bargainingadvantages  which one country holds over another.     45.  This  tendency  has been accentuated by  the weight given to political, as opposed to  economic  considerations.   There is, first, the desire  of this countryto promote  inter-imperial trade.  There is the similar  desire within the  French Empire.  There is thirdly the German insistence upon autarky.  Other examples are to be found in the Japanese desire to dominate the Chinese market, and in theGerman and Italian struggle for markets in South-Eastern  Europe. The fear ofwar and the paramount necessity of  securing supplies from quarters access towhich would not be imperilled  by the outbreak  of hostilities, has in  some casesgiven force to  these policies.  And in some cases their success has been assisted by the natural desire of comparatively weak  countries to conciliate a powerful and insistent neighbour.     46.  We  may conclude that whereas some  of the restrictions  which nowhamper world trade will tend to disappear if the international position developsfavourably,  there are others which may prove more obstinate.  Restrictions suchas quotas, whose  sole purpose is to limit imports, will not be continued when thepreoccupation  of governments  is focused more on  the  difficulty of obtaining supplies and less on the necessity of protecting  home industries.  On the otherhand,  many of the policies which have  led  to  the  canalisation of  trade have their roots in the necessity of effecting a readjustment in internal economy afterthe  collapse of the inherently  unstable equilibrium existing before  the  worlddepression,  and thus affect the course of international trade.  They might indeedhave proved unnecessary had it been  possible to effect a rapid readjustment inthe  price structure of  the countries  where major adaptations were required.But since comparatively little progress has been made in  this direction, theircontinuation in some form is probably inevitable for some time.     47.  We may illustrate the importance of measures making for the canalisa-tion of trade, by reference to the position of certain of the major countries.  GreatBritain  and the  other countries of the sterling area have made, comparatively small use of the  more modern devices for the control of trade; and. the sterling area is,  often referred  to as an  example of comparative  freedom  in a worldotherwise given over to  a regime of regulation.  Nevertheless, the overvaluationof sterling has been corrected at least as much by measures directed towards thedeflection of trade from  its previous channels as by the depreciation of the pound.There have been three  major  acts of policy leading  to this  result;^ first, theadoption by Great Britain  of  a.system of moderate  protection,  the principaleffect of which  has  been to curtail  very considerably  our imports  from the
industrial  countries  of  Europe;  secondly,  the Ottawa  policy  of  reciprocalpreferences between  Great Britain on  the  one hand, and the self-governingDominions and the colonies on the other, which, though it has strengthened tosome  extent the position of British exports  in  Empire markets, has been evenmore  effective in reserving the United Kingdom market for Empire  supplies;and,  finally, the trade  agreements negotiated with the  Argentine  and the scandinavian and Baltic countries whereby the dependence of these countries onthe British market for their exports has been used to encourage the expansion ofBritish exports to them.  As a result of these arrangements and of the concurrentdevaluation of  sterling and the currencies associated with  it, it was possible to pursue an  expansive  monetary policy  within the sterling  area  at a time whenthe greater part of the world was still given over to deflationary measures,without imperilling the sterling exchange. It may be remarked that now that moreexpansive monetary policies are being pursued outside the  sterling area,  and an expansion of trade, with an increase of purchasing power is now more likely inthose  areas, the special advantages which Great Britain has derived from herpolicy in the past will tend to diminish; and the principal  effect of maintainingtoo tenaciously the preferential position which it has secured us may be to  restrictour share in the revival  of  trade now  in  progress  in the rest of the world.    48.  The policy pursued by Great Britain has had important reactions onthe continent of Europe.   Germany in particular has been forced to rearrangethe whole structure of her trading relations  since  the onset  of the depression.Before 1929, Germany bought her raw  materials largely from  the United States,from  the British  Empire, and from South America.  She financed these importslargely by  exports to Great Britain, to  the Scandinavian  countries who had alarge  export surplus  with  Great Britain, and to the countries of Central andSouth Eastern Europe,  which were at  that time being  largely financed by american loans.   These sources  of foreign  exchange have  been very  greatly reduced by changes in British trading policy and the cessation of foreign lendingby the United States.  In consequence, it has been of the greatest  importance toGermany to improve her export position  in markets unaffected by British policy.This improvement she has secured  partly by  the  aid of subsidies, but principallyby the simple device of buying in these neutral markets largely in excess of hercapacity to pay in freely transferable currency, and by insisting that balancesagainst her should be liquidated by the  export  of goods.   She has been  able to pursue this course either because  the  countries from which  she has made herpurchases have had difficulty in disposing of their  products in the free markets of the world or by offering an extremely favourable price in reichsmarks, whichhas not, of course,   always  proved so  satisfactory  when the German goodspurchased with the reichsmarks came to be disposed of.    49.  It is  an interesting fact  that transactions of  this  kind have beencomparatively infrequent between Germany and members of the British Empire.Eor in their case  the sellers of primary produce have a free market open to themand have themselves sufficient financial reserves to  prevent them making forcedsales  on disadvantageous terms.  Moreover,  the Anglo-German payments agree-ment, affording as it does  a supply of sterling  to Germany, has enabled her topurchase  goods within  the  British  Empire without  forcing  her goods  intodominion and colonial markets.  In the rest of the world Germany has been ableto use her position as the only unsatisfied market for raw materials to force outher exports, and  has  thus created  what is rapidly becoming an area of german influence out of the parts of the world excluded from the sterling area.    50.  Though Germany has not succeeded in securing by these means suppliesof raw materials adequate to her needs, she has been able to carry through a programme of rearmament on an unprecedented scale.  Even in normal  circum-stances this might have led to a substantial adverse balance of payments, but ithas been undertaken at a time when recourse to  foreign borrowing has  been closed to her, and when, indeed, her receipts of foreign exchange from tourist traffic are earmarked for the liquidation of her short-term debt abroad.   It may,therefore, be confidently expected that she  will be very reluctant to relinquishthe benefits which she has obtained  by her system of clearing accounts and&quot; Aski &quot; marks.   We do not  rule out  the possibility that Germany will  in timeaccept the necessity  of devaluation.  But if  she does devalue, her object will be
 to avoid the internal financial complications which flow from her system of export subsidies, rather than  to free her exchange from the  rigorous control to which it is now subjected.  It is conceivable indeed that the effectiveness of her present system will be reduced as the world demand for raw materials expands.   For in that event the willingness of Germany&apos;s suppliers  to accept &quot; Aski &quot; marks or clearing account balances might disappear.  For the moment,  however, Germany is unlikely to renounce the advantages which  she has  gained  for herself  by her complicated system of  control over foreign trade.     51.  We  come finally to  Japan, who has probably  suffered more from discriminatory  practices  than any  other nation.   The severity  of  Japanese competition arises  in part from the peculiar weakness  of the Japanese economic position.   Her principal export before the slump was silk, the position of which was undermined partly by the permanent competition of artificial silk, and partly by the temporary drying up of  demand in the  United States, her largest market. Being deficient in other raw materials, she was forced to turn to her manufactures to supply the  deficiency which appeared in her export  trade.  Unfortunately, however,  her manufactures were precisely those the production of which had be.ui most  stimulated in other countries  which  were  encouraging  the process  of industrialisation behind heavy tariffs.   Her cotton   goods  were  exceedingly unwelcome to producers in South America, in the British Dominions and India and in the less advanced  countries of Europe.   Moreover,  the older  industrial countries  were  themselves  burdened with excessive industrial  capacity  in  the industries affected by Japanese competition, and not  only were unwilling to accept Japanese  goods in their domestic markets, but also excluded  them  as  far  as possible from the colonial markets which they controlled.  This,  however, is not a complete account of the difficulties associated  with  Japanese competition. Japan is  divided into two nations; on one side there is a comparatively efficient though not very advanced industrial nation using the methods of production of industrial Europe;, and on the other there is a much larger agricultural nation, which, owing to the pressure of a vast  population in a  comparatively small area, is only capable of maintaining itself  at  a very low standard  of living.  The standard  of living throughout Japanese life is  set by the agricultural community, and it is therefore possible  for  industrial Japan to  undersell her  European competitors at every point.  In a perfectly free world the solution of this problem would be achieved  by a rise in the general standard of life throughout Japan, which would call for large imports of food;  and this would imply a willingness on the part of the relatively efficient agricultural  nations, such as those of North and South America and Australia,   to  accept  great  quantities  of  Japanese manufactures.  But as  greater industrialisation is a settled part of the policy of the  agricultural nations, this is a solution which is very unlikely to be quickly reached.     52.   The closer relationship of members  of  the sterling  area, the German system of fostering exports, and the  special position  of Japan  are all factors which will make for the prolongation of exchange restrictions even if greater liquidity  is restored to the international financial system under the influence of the events described earlier in this report.  If  these restrictions are gradually to disappear,  it will  be  necessary  to  leave some element of  flexibility  in  the mechanism of international trade, so that no abrupt changes in the structure of internal prices  is  required of any country in  response to  variations in  the commercial policy  of others.   This flexibility will  most easily be achieved byavoiding  any  immediate return to the system of legally unalterable  exchange parities.   Moreover, we must look to the possibility that within the  next fewyears a setback in trade may develop  which  will require renewed government intervention in the monetary field, intervention which  may be impossible  if  thegovernment is committed to the maintenance of fixed exchange parities.   Thereare,  of course,  serious  difficulties associated with the operation of a system  ofvariable exchange parities;  and if it is necessary to  envisage the prolongation ofthis system for a further period of years, an attempt will have to be made  to overcome  them.  Fundamentally, these difficulties  arise  from the fact that  in theordinary  course of export trade commitments in foreign currencies have to be incurred relating to a future period.  In the case of  some of the major currenciesthese difficulties are met to some extent  by dealings in forward  exchange; thougheven in their case such  dealings are not possible very far in the future.  It is by
the extension of such dealings, assisted as they must be by close co-operationamong the central banks concerned, that the problems arising from the possibilityof variations in the level of the exchanges must be met.    53.  The recovery which has taken place both in the United Kingdom and inthe Empire as a whole has involved a considerable  dislocation of trade with therest of the world. It is gradually becoming clear that full recovery, both in theEmpire and in the rest of the world, cannot be expected without some resumptionof trade along its old channels.  The possibility of a development of world trade on these lines depends on France and the United States as well as on the UnitedKingdom, but the changes in British policy since 1931 have probably caused themain  alterations  in the channels of trade,  and therefore it rests largely with usnow to&apos; do what is possible  to  restore  the situation.   Without  suggesting theabandonment of the policies of protection and the Ottawa Agreements  we thinkit inadvisable, under present conditions, to carry either policy  further.   Indeed,just as conditions prevailing during the  depression  were the ground for theadoption of these policies, so the changed conditions now  prevailing make somesteps  in the opposite direction  desirable;  and in our  opinion the objective ofpolicy should now be to seek to expand  trade, wherever possible, between theUnited Kingdom and the Empire,  on the one hand,  and the rest of the world, onthe other.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     December 18,  1936.
