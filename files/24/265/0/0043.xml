[This  Document is  the  Property  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1936.SECRET.CP. 323 (36).Copy No. ...CABINET.RECRUITING  FOR  THE  ARMY.MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   I appreciate the  difficulties with which the Secretary of State for War is facedand I can understand, therefore, the importance which he attaches to the proposals put  forward  in  his Memorandum  on recruitment (CP. 322).  It will  he seen,however, that the greater part of the cost  of them, if sanctioned, would fall, not on british, but on Indian revenues, and it is  essential, therefore, that I  should  informmy colleagues of India&apos;s position in the matter of her expenditure upon the defence services.  The conclusion to be drawn from a consideration of all the factors in thecase will be  found  to be that India, far  from being in  a position to add  to  herexpenditure on defence, is likely, as I shall explain, to prefer a request in the nearfuture for an  increase in the subvention of  1,500,000  of which she is at presentin receipt following on the award of the Garran Tribunal.    There are two distinct  aspects of the case to which I would direct attention:(a) the actual difficulty of financing any further  demands in  respect of the Armyover  and above the requirements of  the security of India, and (b)  the political repercussions which compliance  with  such  demands  would inevitably have throughout India.   I will deal first of all  with (a).    India already spends rather more than 41 per cent, of her Central revenue uponthe  defence  services.   The  actual  Budget  estimates  for 1936-37  are,  revenue 92 million,  expenditure on  defence   SS  million.   The Cabinet will remember that a careful examination of  the finances of India was recently undertaken  bySir Otto Niemeyer  with a view to providing Parliament with  material on which  to base a decision as to the practicability, from a financial  point of view, of bringing.into operation  the  first part of the  Constitution  embodied  in the Government ofIndia  Act of 1935.  The  financial scheme recommended by Sir Otto Niemeyerinvolved a number  of complicated and delicate adjustments  between the  centre and  the  Provinces without  which  it  would  not have  been possible  to bringProvincial Autonomy into operation ;  and his considered opinion was stated in these words &quot;. .  . on a  general review of existing tendencies I should conclude that the budgetary prospects of  India, given prudent  management  of her finances, justifythe view that adequate arrangements can be made, step by step, to meet the financial implications  of the  new Constitution.&quot;  It has to be borne in mind, however, that sir Otto Niemeyer only  reached this conclusion after his review had indicated that though no substantial reduction in expenditure at the Centre could  be expected, itwas at least &quot; unnecessary to contemplate any serious increase in total (Central)expenditure unless  the Railway Budget, contrary to expectation, fails to improve.&quot;    In deciding to inaugurate Provincial Autonomy next April we have accepted notonly  this opinion, but also the premises on which it rested, and it would be idle  to suppose that  on her present carefully balanced levels of  income and  expenditureany additional charges can  be met.   In other words, if the cost of these proposals was to be imposed upon India fresh taxation would become inevitable.   But this  isnot all, for India is  actually faced at the present time with demands that she should bring her military organisation and equipment up to a much higher standard than has been necessary  in the past in order that she may keep pace with the changes  in organisation  dictated by the needs of the Field Force and of the Cardwell  system. In the view of the  Government of India the early execution of this programme of reorganisation and re-equipment is the most useful contribution which they can make to the defence of the Empire.  Such deficiencies as exist in India are not comparable in point of seriousness or of urgency with those which we are. trying to  remedy here. Some of the measures  in the Indian  programme are desirable on her  own account, though they  could hardly be described as urgently necessary.   Others  have  no  real      5387    85  11.36
 ralson (Vulva  except the desire to conform in the general  interests with changes in army organisation at home.   None of the military deficiencies which we should like to meet in India is of such a nature as to constitute a danger  to India&apos;s security. The estimated cost of these various measures  is Rs. 7  crores or   5   million. Every possible method of finding this sum  within  any reasonable  period  of time from Indian resources  without resort to fresh taxation has been explored  without success;  and it is in this couuection  that the Government of India are likely in the near future to appeal for a revision of the amount which she at present  receives under the Garran Award-  I would remind my colleagues that the Garran Tribunal recommended  a contribution from the  Home  Government towards the cost of the Army in India on the following grounds :        (I)  That the Army in India  is a force, ready in an emergency to take the !    field at once, which  does not exist elsewhere in  the Empire, which is specially     available  for immediate use in the East, and  which has on  occasion  been     so used.       (2)  That India is  a training ground for active service such as does not exist     elsewhere in the  Empire.    The Tribunal  made no recommendation as to the amount of the contribution, which, in  the circumstances prevalent  at the time, was  fixed at  1,500,000  by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    I  now  come to (b), the political aspect of the  case.   I have  already called attention  to the  heavy  percentage  of  the Central revenues  which  is  already earmarked for defence and so excluded from the control of the Indian Legislature. As the Cabinet must be well  aware, public opinion  in India already finds in  this a source of bitter complaint.   I have recently received from the Viceroy his opinion as to the effect which any increase of taxation for defence purposes would  have on  the political situation.  He  tells  me  that  in his considered view the results would be so serious as to imperil the prospects of the new Constitution.  He adds that even  moderate Indian opinion would say that the plan had  been deliberately designed to make India pay the major  part of the cost of  measures required  to meet an Imperial emergency in  the matter of recruiting.  It has to be remembered that the cost of a British soldier in  India  is already something like three  times the  cost of an Indian soldier,  and  nothing would  be more  calculated  to arouse feelings of bitterness against the British soldier and the British  connection  than to  impose  upon  India  a still  greater burden for his maintenance.  It  may  be said that the sum involved is after all uot a vast  one, and that I am exaggerating the  effect which it  would  have on  the Indian  Budget.   The cost to India is estimated  by the Secretary of State  for  War  at   150,000 capital and  1,139,000recurring,  and  it may be  admitted that  in the   800  million  Budget of the United Kingdom the amount might  be  described  as comparatively  trifling.   not so in the case of the Indian  Budget of little more than  90 million.  Indeed, if it were possible to translate  this into  a comparable figure  in our own  Budget, making allowance for the size of the  Indian Budget and the taxable capacity. of  the country, the  result would be a  sum  of  staggering  dimensions, and this sum would be  devoted to  one purpose only, namely,  concessions to British troops. In these circumstances it is clear that the Government of India will not voluntarily agree to impose the necessary taxation, and  I should be extremely loath to  require them to do so.  Indeed, in  matters affecting  charges upon  the revenues of  India the  Secretary  of State himself is not a free agent since all such charges  require the  concurrence of his Council, and I should anticipate great difficulty in securing their concurrence in this case.   The conclusion  to be  drawn, therefore, from a consideration of the politicalaspect of the case is that,  if  it were decided to overrule the Government of  India in the  matter, a situation of real gravity would be created which might well involve His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  on  the   very  eve of  the  inauguration of the  new Constitution in yet one more problem of the first magnitude.   I would add one word in conclusion.  I have not attempted in this memorandum to examine in  detail, the  pros and cons from the  point  of India of  each  particular -proposal  set forth in  the  memorandum  of the Secretary of  State for War; that I shall be prepared to do,  if required, in the course  of discussion, or, if it is preferred,in  a separate  memorandum.  I have tried  rather  to present to my colleagues  in
tbroad outline three main considerations which seem to me to be vital in connectionwith this problem.  They are stated in the briefest possible terms, as follows :       (1) That without placing such an excessive burden upon  the  Indian  tax-    payer as would impede the economic recovery of the country,  India cannot  in    present  circumstances  raise the additional money required  to  finance the    proposals of the Secretary of State for War.      (2) That to require the Government of India to do so would  be likely to  give    rise to a political situation of real gravity.      (3) That, unless  means  can  be found of relieving  her of  the  rising cost,    India will  find great difficulty in  continuing  to  serve the  interests of the    Empire  as hitherto by  maintaining forces organised and equipped on a level    in excess of purely Indian requirements and ready in an emergency to take the    field at once.                                                                          Z.     INDIA OFFICE,  28th November 1936.
