Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 292 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE  SITUATION:  TEXT OF PROPOSED  ANNOUNCEMENT                   IN  THE  HOUSE  OF  COMMONS.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    AT their meeting of the 28th October the Cabinet accepted my view thatthere should be  no change in policy  and no suspension of immigration into palestine for political reasons.    2.  There  were, however, certain points  upon which I was asked  to make further enquiry  of the High Commissioner.   I attach in Appendix I to thisMemorandum  copies  of my  private  and  personal  telegram  to  the HighCommissioner of the 29th October and his reply of the 31st  October.  these telegrams are self-explanatory and I need not comment upon them.  But I mightpoint out that the  total  Jewish immigration  for  the six months October 1936-March 1937 is estimated by the Commissioner for Migration at 10,000 only, ascompared with 17,350 for  the  preceding six months.  Even allowing for  an addition of, say, 1,500 on account of illicit immigration, the figure would be very substantially less than for the preceding six  months.  It will be seen, however,that the High Commissioner fears that the  Commissioner for Migration may prove to be under the mark in his estimate of the total immigration for the periodOctober 1936-March 1937,  for the reason that the Jewish  Agency  may  do everything possible to stimulate immigration  as they have done in the  last fewmonths. I shall be  seeing Dr. Weizmann before the next meeting of the  Cabinet,when I shall endeavour to secure his co-operation in keeping immigration figures as low as possible, and I will report to the Cabinet on the 4th November the resultof my conversation with  him.    3.  I attach as Appendix II to this Memorandum the draft of the statement which I should propose to make in the House of Commons on the  5th Novemberregarding immigration.                                              (Initialled)      W.  0. G.    Colonial Office, Downing  Street,          November 2, 1936.[14043]
APPENDIX I. &apos;(a)  Private and Personal Telegram from Secretary of State for the Colonies to         the High Commissioner for Palestine, dated October 29, 1936.    MY  telegram, personal, of the  26th October.  Yesterday Cabinet approved in principle  that  there  should be  no  suspension  of immigration  for political reasons, and they also approved your proposals regarding the Labour Schedule.But anxiety was expressed lest during coming months large  numbers of Jewsmight, in fact, enter Palestine as capitalists and as dependants of residents or of immigrants admitted under categories other than C.    As the result of discussion in Cabinet, there are three points on which I wantspecifically to consult you :     1. Cabinet  would  like  your  opinion  as  to  whether  any  restriction  ofcapitalists (as distinct from complete suspension) from an economic point of view is desirable or practicable.  (I realise, of course, that  the Immigration Law couldbe amended,  as  was at one time  contemplated, so as to increase  the minimumcapital qualifying for admission, but you will remember that on the 24th MarchMr. Thomas stated in the House of Commons that the suggested increase from 1,000 to   2,000 would not be proceeded  with, and  I doubt  whether any amendment of the Law  in that direction could now be considered.)    2. How many certificates allocated in the Autumn of 1935 and the Spring of1936 still remain unused ?  And what numbers of dependants by categories is itestimated will be entering before next April?  I should be  glad also to receivethis October&apos;s figure,  as far as available.  The point is that the Cabinet seekreassurance that totals of Jewish immigration during  coining months will, in fact,be materially less than in recent months.    3. It was suggested that persons entering Palestine as capitalists buy land.If so, this would be  argument for  restricting number of such immigrants  asfurther alienation of  Arab land to Jews while Royal Commission is sitting is undesirable.    I propose to  see  Dr.  Weizmann on Monday  and endeavour  to secure hisco-operation in keeping  down the numbers of Jewish immigrants in all categoriesduring the coming months, and I should therefore like your reply to this telegrambefore then, if possible not later than the 1st November.    Cabinet will further consider the matter at meeting next Wednesday, whentext for statement on lines proposed in your telegram No: 864 of the 28th Octoberwill be settled.  I  shall telegraph  the approved  text  to you  that evening andannouncement would be made here the following day.(b)  Private and Personal Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine       to the Secretary  of State for the Colonies, dated October 31, 1936.    YOUR personal telegram of the 29th October.    1.  From an economic point of view I do not consider that a restriction ofcapitalist immigration  would be desirable  nor would it be  practicable withoutaltering  existing  laws  or regulations which I do  not  recommend in presentcircumstances.   Increase of qualifying capital from  1,000 to  2,000 would bebitterly resented by Jews and might be represented  as prejudging the findings of the Royal Commission.    2. (a) It is not  possible to estimate how many certificates granted in theautumn of 1935 and the spring of  1936  still remain unused.   Between october and December 1935, 1,320 dependants certificates  (each of which might&apos;on theaverage mean the  introduction of three persons) were issued.   These certificateshad a validity  of twelve months.  No  doubt  many of them  have been used andby 31st December next all- of the remainder will have  expired.  Certificates issued in the spring 1936 have either been already  used or have now expired:    (b)  Commissioner of Migration anticipates that about 7,000 dependants ofall categories will enter  during six months ending 31st March, 1937. Of these, heanticipates that 900 will be of category A1,  1,300 of category C  and  4,000 Ofresidents. :  -   -                           -
    (c)  For the  period  1st October  to 26th  October provisional figure  of immigration is 1,200 (including 750 dependants).    (d)  Total  immigration  for  the six months ending 31st  March,  1937, isestimated by  the  Commissioner at  10,000  (as  compared  with 17,350 for thepreceding six months).  As much as 1,500 might be added  to the above total onaccount  of illicit immigration.    I fear that the Commissioner may prove to be under the mark in his estimateof total  immigration,  since Jewish Agency,  anticipating  that restrictions  of immigration may be  recommended by the Royal  Commission,  will do everything possible  to stimulate immigration as they have done in the last few months.   Ishall be  grateful if you will endeavour to secure Dr. Weizmann&apos;s co-operation in keeping  immigration figures as low as possible.    3.   I doubt  whether temporary restriction of capitalist immigration wouldappreciably  affect alienation  of Arab  land,  since  existing   companies  andcapitalists already in  Palestine will continue land purchases, and intendingimmigrants could, and do, purchase land from abroad through agents.APPENDIX II.                              Draft Statement.     ON the 19th June and  the  22nd  July I informed the House that His Majesty&apos;s Government could contemplate no change  of  policy whatsoever with regard  to Palestine  until they had  received and  considered the Report of  the Royal Commission.  On the 22nd July I also said  that as regards the suggestion that there should be a temporary suspension of immigration while the Commission is carrying  out  its enquiries,  I was not at the time  in  a position  to make any statement as to  the intentions of  His Majesty&apos;s Government beyond saying that their decision would be taken in due course on the  merits of  the case.     As the House  is aware, the Royal Commission  is leaving for Palestine to-day and His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered whether or not there should be a temporary suspension of immigration while the Commission is carrying out its enquiries.  They have decided that a temporary suspension of immigration; would not be justifiable on economic or on other grounds.   It is, in the  view of His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  right that the status quo  should be maintained pending the Report of the Royal Commission; and if immigration were suspended, this would be regarded  as prejudicing the  enquiries  of  the Royal  Commission, which will be directed, among  other matters, to the very important question of immigration generally.    At  the  same time, His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  thought it right in  the present  circumstances obtaining in Palestine to ask the High Commissioner to take a conservative view of the  economic  absorptive capacity of the country.  He has accordingly recommended that the six-monthly Labour Immigration Schedule, which was due to be issued last month, should be fixed at 1,800 certificates : this recommendation has been approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  These figures compare with a Schedule of 8,000 in April 1935; 3,250  in October 1935; and 4,500 in April 1936.    The new Schedule of  1,800  certificates includes a special  allotment  of 300 certificates  to  provide for  registration  as immigrants of the German-Jews in possession of a capital of  1,000 already in Palestine  who will have been unable as yet to transfer from Germany the qualifying capital within a prescribed period of twelve months.  The total increase, therefore, in the Jewish population resulting from  this  schedule will not exceed  1,500.    It will be  appreciated,however, that immigration is not confined to  those persons who receive certificatesunder the Labour Schedule.  The categories  under  which other immigrants enterax&apos;e as capitalists (that is  to say,  persons in possession of not less than   1,000)and dependants  of such  capitalists, of persons authorised to enter under  theLabour  Schedule,  and of  persons  already  resident in Palestine.   Taking intoaccount  all,forms  of Jewish immigration, it is expected that the total  for  the six months from October 1936 will be substantially below that for the precedingsix months.
