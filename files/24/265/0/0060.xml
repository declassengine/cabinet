ID3NTIAX.                                               A.C. 367.                        BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.                        STATE OF TRADE - NOVEMBER, 1956.              OVERSEAS TRADE.  Imports in November at  78.7 m .         were  7.2 m. more  than in November, 1935.   Nearly &amp;0% of         the rise was in food and raw materials.   Of the increase of          1.6 m. in manufactured goods, nearly  400,000 related to         machinery and  172,000 to non-ferrous metals.   Exports of         United Kingdom products,  38.4 m., were nearly  1 m.  less and         re-exports,  4.3 m. , were  230,000 less than in November, 1935         (which however, had one more working day).              EMPLOYMENT.   The total number of unemployed persons         on the registers at 23rd November - 1,623,602 - was 11,798         more than at 25th October.   The main variations were:-              London  .......  * 5,613     North Western . 4- 1,260              South Eastern .  4* 9, 978     Northern......- 2,044              South Western -  4- 3 , 704     Scotland......4- 4,109              Midlands......  - 2,744     Wales.........- 7,155              North Eastern .  -   929         The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-G4 in         employment  (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,120,000  -         17,000 more than at 26th October and 560,000 more than at         25th November, 1935.              Employment improved  (as compared with October) in the         coal mining, iron and steel, engineering, motor vehicle and         aircraft, metal goods, cotton and wool industries, the dock         and harbour service, and the distributive trade;  but it         declined in building and public works contracting, in most         of the clothing trades (including boot and shoe manufacture)         and in the hotel, etc., service.              RAILWAY TRAFFIC.   In the five weeks ended 29th November,         railway traffic receipts increased by  154,000 (1,07%)                                -1-
1 compared with  the  corresponding period of 1935.   Passenger traffic increased  by 4. 365^ and merchandise, minerals arid livestock by 2.64;% but coal, coke and patent fuel fell by 5.49$.      SHIPPING AND  SHIPBUILDING.   All freight markets were firm, tonnage vras  well distributed and the healthy  demand for cargo space  continued.   The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 = 100) was 111.41 as against 110.73 in October  and 89.74 a year ago.   operating costs are showing an upward tendency.   The improvement in shipbuilding is  being well maintained.      BANKING.    Money was more plentiful than in October&quot; The average Treasury bill rate varied between lo/6.24d. arl r 11/5.29d.   Some stringency in money at the end of  the year may be anticipated.   There was little variation in the price of gold owing  to the steadiness of the dollar, the  movement being between 141/loid. and 142/8-^.   The price of  silver1                              15/ fluctuated  between 20d. and 22  i6d.   The franc remained remarkably steady  around lu5^;  a weaker tendency at the beginning of the month (when the three months&apos; forward rate rose  to 3-g discount) was overcome.   The dollar was steady between 4.87^ and  4.90f.      COAL.   The  average weekly output of coal during the thirteen weeks ended 21st November was 4*56 m. tons as compared with 4.49 m. tons in the corresponding period a year  ago.   The  average number of wage earners employed was slightly more than a year before.   Exports in November amounted to 2.92 m. tons as compared with 3.50 m. tons inNovember, 1935.   Most markets took less, notably Egypt, Spain, Canada,  the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands. The chief increase was to Belgium.
     IRON AND STEEL. Iron and steel markets continued very busy.   Thetendency for delivery periods to lengthen became general.  In the pig-iron section new plant commenced operation.   Morefurnaces are lively to be blown in as soon as the uncertaintyregarding ore and fuel supplies has been removed.   Pi^-ironoutput (645,100 tons.  was 21.5 per cent, greater, ana cruaesteel production (1,001,300 tons) was 10.3 per cent, greater,than in November, 1935.   Producers of semi-finished steeloperated at almost full capacity.   The strong demand forserai&apos;s necessitated imports from the Cartel countries inexcess of the agreed quota.   The starting of new plant earlyin 1937 will euse the position.   Nearly all branches of the&quot;finished&quot; section produced record amounts.     Total exports of iron ana steel were 193,300 tons,compared with 194,400 in October ana 212,000 a year before.     Scotland.  The industry was busier than in any previous month this year ana demand still tends to increase.   A new plant for the production of bars ana semis will be startedearly in 1937.     North  East Coast.  Pit-iron producers were wellemployed ana a further increase in output may be necessary.Recent price increases did not appear to affect demand.  Steelworks were fully occupied.     Sheffield.  Production records continue to be broken.Detnana for special, and stainless steels was particularlystrong.   Export orders for alloy steels were good.     South Wales.  Activity was well maintained and demand for most products was increasing.   Business in heavy finished steel was particularly good.   The tinplate trade was wellemployed but the galvanised sheet section still suffered from l&amp;cic of satisfactory export markets.
     ENGINEERING.   Activity further increased;  it was increasingly difficult in certain cases to keep pace withdemand.   A still higher level of activity is anticipatedduring the ner.t few months at least.   Exports ofmachinery were valued at S3,64 n, as compared with  3.50 m.in November, 1935.   Imports valued at  1.55 ra, were 390,000 more than a year ago;  machine tools accounted for more than half this increase.     MOTOR INDUSTRY.   The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered in October was 33S4G7 - 3,331 more than a yearago;  the increase in private cars was 1,351.  Theproduction of private cars during the year ended september was 353,838, as against 511,544 in the previous year, andthe production of commercial vehicles increased from 8,176 to 108,109.   Exports of new private cars andchassis in November amounted to 6,322 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,637 - 28;. and 42:: respectivelymore than in November, 1935.   1,290 complete new private cars and taxis were imported as compared with 756 a year ago     LIGHT I.JETAL INDUSTRIES.   Activity increased or was maintained in most light metal trades.  The lock and allied trades were very busy and several makers have hadto extend their capacity.   Difficulty was experienced in meeting the exceptionally heavy denanfi for engineers&apos;small tools and precision tools.  The export trade incutlery and plate improved.     ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.,  Activity continued at asatisfactory level, particularly on the heavy side.  Theindex of heavy engineering orders (both home and export)was much higher than for November, 1935.  Consumption ofelectricity amounted to 2,010 ra. units - 14.3 per cent.more than a year ago.
     COTTON. The seasonal expansion of activity was maintained.Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were28.8 m. lbs. as compared with 27.6 m. lbs, in October and30.6 m. in November, 1935.  Yarn production represented80^ of spinning capacity, as compared with 77% a year ago.Prices of American raw cotton fell but prices of Egyptianand Indian cottons tended to rise.  The increase in yarnprices, begun in October, continued and spinners&apos; marginsprobably widened appreciably.  Yarn exports at 12.4 m. lbs.were  .6 m. lbs.  less than in October but slightly more thanin November, 1935.  Exports of piece goods at 154 m. square yards were 24 m,  square yards less than in October (whenthey were exceptionally large) and 4 m, square yards lessthan in November, 1935. Exports to most of the importantmarkets were less than in October, those to British WestAfrica falling by 9 m. square yards; the largest increasewps to the Dutch East Indies.  An agreement to increaseweavers&apos; wage rates, to take effect early in 1937, wasreached.     SILK AND ARTIPICIiiL SHK, - Rayon, The general tone  in the  weavingtrade,  particularly in Lancashire,  was optimistic. Demand forstaple fibre improved, &quot;but the possibility of labour troublesin the cotton trade had a somewhat unsettling effect.Business in rayon piecegoods suffered from the competition of light weight woollens.  Exports of rayon yarns declinedcompared with November, 1935, but exports of piecegoodsincreased.     Silk.  The fluctuations in raw silk prices had anunsettling effect on the piecegoods trade, but there was some activity in the printed goods section.
     WOOL. General activity was well maintained; although no-&apos;,so busy as the woollen section, the worsted sectionimproved considerably.   Exports of yarns and tissueswere less than in October, but exports of tops increased.Raw wool prices rose sharioly.   Reports as to new businesswere favourable on the whole.     HIDES AhD LEATHER.   Hide markets were very activeduring November and prices steadily advanced.  Conditionsin the leather trade were on the whole unsatisfactory.Manufacturers experienced great difficulty in obtainingadvances in the prices of their finishec3 productscommensurate with the increased cost of raw materials.     RETAIL TRADE.    The money vaLue of retail sales inOctober was 7.3 per cent, greater than in October, 1935*Sales of food and perishables rose by 6.4 per cent, andof other merchandise by 8.2 per cent.   PreliminaryReturns for November indicate continued expansion for thecountry as a whole.    AUSTRALIAN TRADE. The wool positien remained very sound.  1,76,3,000bales were received into store from 1st July to31st October as compared with 1,715,000 a year before,the quantity sold or shipped being 611,000 and 722,000respectively.    Wheat and flour shipments in the yearended 30th November were equivalent to 98.4 m. bushelsof wheat as against 102.5 m. a year ago.   Buttershipments from 1st July to 28th November pere 27,380 ton&quot; .as compared with 32,500 for approximately the same perioda year ago.   Imports of merchandise during Octoberamounted to  9.86 m. (Australian currency) as comparedwith  9.49 m.  a year before.
     CANADIAN TRADE.    Economic conditions improvedfurther in October,  The index of physical volume  ofbusiness was higher than at any time since 1930.   Comparedwith the previous month, imports of textile raw materials and crude petroleum increased but imports of bauxitedeclined.  Exports of copper,  .zinc, asbestos and  planksand boards rose but nickel and v/ood pulp exports fell.The iron and steel industry was more active and newsprintproduction reached a new high point.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE. Imports in September were18.9% greater than in September, 1935.    Exports(excluding gold) were slightly more.  Shipment of  diamonds,wool and sugar increased substantially.   Maize exports were almost negligible.  Gold output was greater  than inSeptember, 1935;  exports were 2.5$ less.  The woolmarket was very active and prices hardened further.   SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.   The improvement in economicconditions continued.   Argentina. The surplus of exports over imports  for thecurrent year will probably exceed that in 1935.  unless there is very unseasonable weather, good 1936/37  crops  arelikely.  Grain charterings were heavy and wool sold atrecord prices.   The National Revenue figures are buoyant.The peso appreciated by nearly 6% and the gradualrelinquishment of exchange control is anticipated.  TheGovernment&apos;s minimum guaranteed prices for wheat  andlinseed were suspended.  Wheat and maize prices were firm.   Brazil. Exports and imports for the first nine months of1936 were higher than a year before.  Coffee shipments  were greater in value, though less in volume.  The improvementin shipments of cotton and frozen and preserved meat was maintained.  The coffee market was firm.    The foreign
exchange position was easier and the milrei  improvedfurther.   Chile. Both imports and exports for  January - Septemberincreased as compared with January - September,  1935.   Theforeign exchange position continued difficult.   Certainluxury articles can now only be imported against purchases of gold.  The outlook still gives cause for  some concern.   Uruguay * The situation continued satisfactory.Weather was mainly favourable to growing crops.    The  1936budget is expected to close with a substantial surplus.The wool market was very active.   Colombia.  Coffee shipments were well maintained and prices were firm.  Coffee exporters are optimisticregarding the immediate future.   Peru.  The expansion in overseas trade continued.Reports on the coming cotton crop were favourable.   Ecuador.  The shortage of foreign exchange continued,Cocoa and coffee were active markets.   Venezuela.  The new-crop coffee met a fair demand from europe.   Paraguay.  The country is slowly recovering from theeffects of the Bolivian War.  Trade was dull but the underlying tone is considered sound.
