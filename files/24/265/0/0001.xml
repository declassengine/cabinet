Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 281 (36).CABINET.ARGENTINA-MUTTON  AND  LAMB.            Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     THE long negotiations with Argentina are now nearing an end one end or another.  By argument or threat, the Argentine negotiators have been induced to accept the levy of f&apos;d a lb.  (say, 20 per cent.) on chilled beef (with corresponding duties on other beef and beef products), as against  their present right of free entry.  They have accepted the possibility of a further 5 per cent, cut on the quantities they send, over  and  above  the reductions  that  have ensued from the existing Agreement.   We have withdrawn from them their guarantee of freedom from duty for  their  bacon  exports.  They have undertaken to continue, even if they  remove exchange control,  the system  of  import permits,  which gives our exports a 20 per cent, preference over those of certain other countries.  They have agreed to reduce the  amount reserved from our exchange quota to meet the service of their public debt in other countries.   They have given us assurances as to Japanese competition in textiles.     All these  are additional to the benefits we received under the existing Agreement.  All are to the detriment of Argentina,     I need  only trouble my colleagues with one of the points  as yet unsettled. It was agreed  some months ago that we could offer Argentina freedom from duty for three years (the proposed term of the Agreement) for mutton and lamb, and a guarantee that her imports would not be further reduced during the first year of  the  Agreement.  The  Argentine  negotiators are not authorised, by their present instructions, to  sign an Agreement which  does not extend this last guarantee for the whole three  years&apos; period.    They  were told  that the only guarantee they could be given for quantities in the second and third  years would be a guarantee that they would not be cut by more than a percentage which would be considerable, an offer which they thought worse than no guarantee.    At a meeting with the two Ambassadors, which I described as a final meeting in order to force  them to settle outstanding points, Dr. le Breton unexpectedly offered to submit to his Government a guarantee that Argentine exports of mutton and lamb would not be reduced  by more than another 5 per cent, of the  Ottawa Standard Year quantities.   Some reply had  to be made at once to this unexpected approach, and  I told him that the most I could consider was a guarantee of not more than a  10 per cent, cut in present quantities.    Dr. le Breton obviously thinks the danger of further drastic cuts too real to be ignored, a view in which he  would be strengthened  if he were aware of thearguments advanced  by the Ministry  of Agriculture.   He knows that we have already reduced Argentine exports by 35 per cent., i.e.,  by  484,000 cwt.   he knows, from experience of the old Agreement, and from the current negotiations,that there is  no  effective  limit to what  the  Dominions expect in beef,  and presumably also in mutton.    I told Dr.  le Breton that I had said my last word on all outstanding points.He is still asking for the guarantee he  suggested, and may well fail to inducehis Government to accept anything less. I  think that it is impossible for us  tooffer less than  I  have proposed.   On the particular issues involved, I  would      [13983]
suggest that a possible 10 per cent, further cut on all foreign supplies (following the past cut of 655,000 cwt., or 35 per cent.) gives us good  ground on which todiscuss Dominion exports if  necessary; that the concession  to  Argentina is small;  that the concession is necessary if we are to conclude an Agreement whoseadvantages to our investors and to our exporters (especially  in South Wales andLancashire) outweigh all the concessions we have given.  I do not wish to submitany new compromise to the Argentine negotiators, nor do  I think  they would accept  one.  For  example, it is, I fear,  useless to  suggest a guarantee that any reduction over a given figure shall be shared with the Dominions. The Argentinenegotiators must ask for some definition of the basis on which any such reduction should be made, and  this would lead to an interminable and inconclusive wranglewith the Dominions.  Moreover, Argentina will remember our  inability  to carryout a somewhat similar undertaking given in the  1933 Agreement in regard tochilled beef.  It is useless to consider compromise proposals.  Argentina wants aguarantee,  and she is entitled to a guarantee.  That is Avhat  Agreements are for.    The issue raised in these discussions goes to  the root of the government&apos;s policy and  calls in question the principles on which is based  the system of trade agreements which we have built up laboriously and to which we have committedthis country during the past five years.   If this system is  now to be interruptedrudely  in order to satisfy demands made by a section  of  our supporters in theHouse  of Commons, we shall have to review and re-state our attitude to foreign trade,  and  at the same  time surrender  much of what by this  policy we  havealready achieved.                                                                   W.  R.    Board  of Trade, October 23, 1936.
