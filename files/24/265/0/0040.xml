                                 REPORT.Introduction.    1.  Our Committee was appointed by the Prime Minister in February, 193(3,for the purpose of classifying into certain categories the staffs of GovernmentDepartments, with  a view to meeting requirements of war-time administration.Our terms of reference were subsequently expanded          &quot;To include the submission of a scheme for the selection and prepara-    tion of alternative accommodation for the staffs of Government Departments    remaining  in London, and for those to be evacuated.&apos;&apos;         (C.I.D. 281st  Meeting, Conclusion 9 (/).)    2.  In July,  1936,  we  submitted  a  Report (C.I.D.  Paper No.  1239-B)containing certain recommendations, which may be summarised as follows :      (i) The  retention  of  a nucleus of the Government  machine  in  London,           comprising  those who were essential to the &quot;direction&quot; as opposed to           the  &quot;execution &quot; of plans for the conduct of the war.    (ii) The  evacuation of the staffs of Government Departments from London          on the outbreak of war to provincial localities, with a view to achieving,           by the adoption of a policy of dispersion, a measure of protection           against dislocation by air bombardment.    3.  Our  recommendations  were  adopted  by the Committee of ImperialDefence (C.I.D. 281st  Meeting,  Conclusion 9),  and we were directed to proceedwith the preparation of the necessary scheme.    4.  Our  subsequent investigations in greater  detail have, however, revealedthat a plan on the lines which we had anticipated presents so many difficulties asto render its adoption impracticable. In the first place we have been forced tothe conclusion that to expect a small body of Ministers and senior Crown servants to control war, divorced from their subordinate staffs, is not reasonable.   In thesecond place, alternative accommodation in the provinces on the  scale requiredcould not be provided except by an extensive programme of temporary buildings in advance, which would inevitably entail  publicity.  In the third place a largeevacuation of Government staffs on the  outbreak  of  war might well  be renderedimpossible by sudden and intensive air attacks, and  would, in any case, cause sosevere a degree of dislocation as to endanger the efficient working of war controlduring the first and perhaps most critical period.    For these reasons  we have  had to consider the  problem afresh, and  submitherewith the  conclusions which we have  reached.The Problem.    5.  The effect of air bombardment on the scale to be anticipated in the nextwar is largely a matter of conjecture. Nevertheless, we feel that as a measure ofprecaution we  have  no alternative  but  to assume  that  it  would be  on sounprecedented  a scale  as could render Whitehall untenable.  We  are impressed by the view that, even with the  present-day developments in bombing technique,absolute security cannot be guaranteed.   The range of aircraft is increasing daily,and even if the destructive  power of bombs remains as it stands to-day, we  are faced with a  threat of serious magnitude.  Again, the destruction or dislocation of the machinery of Government, and especially  of that part of the machineryresponsible for the conduct of the war, might well be made the special object of theenemy&apos;s attacks.  Not only is the security of those  responsible for higher directionessential to the successful conduct of the war, but the avoidance of dislocation ofthe essential part of the Government machine is a necessary corollary.    6.  From  this brief review we may  deduce two somewhat contradictoryprinciples :     (a) a degree of dispersion  is necessary to secure the maximum degree of           security against air attack;    (b) a  degree  of  concentration  is   necessary  to  ensure  continuity  of           administration.

Future Policy.     7.  Our examination of the various schemes which have been put before usleads us to the conclusion that a  general tendency to decentralise not only theGovernment, but also the various  activities which  go to make the capital sofavourable a target to enemy aircraft, is one to be encouraged as a matter of long-range policy.   We therefore consider that a policy of decentralising GovernmentDepartments from Whitehall on a permanent basis should be adopted forthwith.The scheme which we have in  mind, however, wmuld inevitably take some years to materialise,  and might not,  in our view,  be completed by 1939 the date laiddown by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the completion of the present re-armamentprogrammes.  We consider, therefore, that an interim scheme should be preparedwhich would enable  some measure  of security to be obtained in the event of warbreaking out before then.  We therefore propose the preparation of two plans :          (a) a short-range plan, and         (b) a long-range plan.The Short-range Plan.     8.  There  exist  on the outskirts of  London,  suitably  distributed,  fourGovernment Offices.   These, which for purposes of secrecy we refer to as &quot;X,&quot;&quot; Y,&quot; &quot; Z &quot; and &quot; W,&quot; could be adapted to provide accommodation for  approxi-mately 13,000 people.   Space  in varying degrees exists at &quot;X,&quot;  &quot;Y,&quot; &quot;Z&quot;and &quot; W &quot; for the preparation of dugouts  and  other defensive measures.   Theextent of the work  of  preparation  required would  vary greatly in each case.This accommodation would enable the essential parts  of the Government machineto continue to  function efficiently, and, provided that adequate protection wassecured for the vital nucleus, would meet the two requirements  referred to aboveof relative security by dispersion  and an adequate degree of concentration for efficient administration.     9.  The  remaining portions of the Government machine would move out toearmarked accommodation in the provinces, but that portion of the machine is not essential to the conduct of the  war,  and an interruption in its work would not,therefore, be of serious consequence.     10.  It would, of course, be of considerable advantage if the majority of theGovernment  Departments could  be evacuated  to  the provinces  during  the precautionary period, or when  a threat of war  was  imminent.  We appreciate,however, that the decision as to the moment for such  an evacuation to take placeis bound up with important political considerations.The Long-range Plan.     11.  To meet the long-range plan, we suggest the building on the peripheryof London of permanent Government accommodation.  In these buildings wewould locate, in time of peace, those Departments or portions of departments which could, without undue inconvenience, perform their functions at a  short distance from the main centre of Government.  These staffs would comprise thosewho were not essential to the conduct of a war, and in the event of war breakingout  they would move to the provinces on the lines advocated under the short-rangeplan.  Thus the dispersed accommodation on the periphery of London would beavailable to house those essential to the conduct  of a war.     12.  We are fully alive to the objections that have been raised  in the past,and will undoubtedly be raised in  the future, to any plan of decentralisation ofadministration in time of peace.   We cannot but feel that the idea of concen-tration has become almost a fetish.  The development of means of communication and of telephones has done much to overcome the inconvenience of decentralisation-tion. We  are,  however,  quite ready to admit that the -standard of conveniencewill not be as high.as,it is to-day, but we are labouring under the shadow of war,and we consider tKah the relatively small sacrifice which decentralisation, underthe system.we propose, would entail, is a small price to pay for relative securityof the nerve centre of. the Empire in time of war. &apos;, ,   ; .13. i Arising out of  this proposal,; we are forced to consideration of  thedecision of&apos;His Majesty&apos;s  Government  to erect a  new  Government  Office in whitehall.
 The New Government Building in  Whitehall.     14.   We submit that at a time when the  nation^ attention  is directed  to rearmament and preparation for  war, on which hundreds of millions are being- expended, the erection at considerable cost of a large building in the centre  of the most dangerous area, and without any form of protection against air attack, is an unjustifiable project.  We have already referred to  the  importance  of dispersion as a matter of future policy.  If this principle is accepted it is hardly consistent to build a  Government Office in Whitehall to accommodate between 5,000 and 6,000 people.     15.   We have given full consideration to the reasons which led His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide upon the building.   There are in this area, extending from St. James&apos; Park to Kingsway, 11,000 staff occupying hired accommodation, but we suggest that if a policy of decentralisation is accepted adequate accommoda- tion in Whitehall could be found for those whom it was necessary to locate there, and the balance could be located  in a series of new buildings suitably designed and suitably located on  the periphery of London.     16.   We would point out that at the time when His Majesty&apos;s Government took the decision to erect this new building in Whitehall war was not a major factor to be taken into account;  whereas to-day it has  to be admitted as a serious possibility.   In addition the problem of unemployment entered into the original decision, while to-day  there is a shortage of labour in  the building trades.     17.  There are, of course, political considerations of some importance, and whilst they  are not strictly within our  competence,  we venture to submit our views.     18.  It  may be alleged that  the abandoning  of  the new building  at  this stage would  be regarded by Parliament as an act of panic, dictated by the  fear of war; but we submit that it might well have the effect of inducing in the mind of the general public a realisation of the present situation.  If our rearmament is to be successful it must have the  backing  of  an  educated  public  opinion.. Efforts are being made to educate public opinion, particularly by the Air Raid Precautions  Department in connection with passive, defence measures, and such an example of decentralising  the central Government would help to convince the country of the gravity with which the Government regard the situation.     19.  A contract for the diversion of a sewer on the Whitehall Gardens site has  already  been authorised, and  the evacuation of  the  Whitehall Gardens premises will start at an early date preliminary to the demolition of the existing buildings on  that site.  It is essential, therefore, if nugatory expenditure is to be avoided,  that an immediate  decision should be taken.  For this reason  we are submitting this Report to the Minister for Co-ordination  of Defence with the suggestion that it should be  referred forthwith to the Cabinet. Summary of  Recommendations.    20.  We  recommend      (1) the encouragement of decentralisation from London of Governmental and           other  activities as a matter  of long-range policy with a  view  to           rendering  the capital a less favourable target for air  bombardment           than is at present the  case  (paragraph  7);.     (2) the adoption of a policy of decentralising Government Departments from           Whitehall forthwith, on a permanent basis (paragraph 7);     (3) the adoption of a short-range plan to meet  the eventuality of war in the           immediate future.  This plan provides, on the outbreak of war, for           fully  protected  accommodation for the vital nucleus  and for the           decentralisation of that part of the machinery of Government which           is essential to the conduct of the war to Government offices on the out-           skirts of  London.  It  also  provides  for  the  evacuation  to  the           provinces of those  staffs not essential to the conduct of the war;

S.W. 1,     November 26, 1936.(4)  the adoption of a long-range plan, under which       (a) those parts of the machinery of Government which could,  with ;\            minimum  of  inconvenience in  time of peace,  be located  in            permanent buildings on  the periphery of London,  should be so            located,  subject to the retention in Whitehall of offices  for the            Ministerial Staff of major departments;      (b) accommodation in Whitehall would be reallocated  to cover those            Departments required near the centre of Government, together            with such  portions  of   Departments  now  housed in hired            buildings as fall within this category;      (c) in war, those staffs not essential to the conduct of the war  accom-            accommodated  in peace in  buildings on  the periphery of London            would be evacuated to the provinces, and their places taken by            essential war  staff other than the nucleus provided with fully            protected accommodation (paragraphs 11 and 12);(5)  the abandoning of the new Government building in  Whitehall  (para-      graphs 14 to 19).
