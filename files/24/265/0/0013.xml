   THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S  government.EGRET                     CABINET                   Copy No  o0p0 393 (36)                Seats on the Coronation Processional Route              Memorandum by the  First  Commissioner  of  Works.                      I hesitate to trouble my colleagues with  what may             appear to he a detail  in  the  Coronation arrangements, but             public interest in  the amount of  accommodation  which can             be provided on the  route  Is already such  that I think the             Cabinet should be acquainted  with the  general position, so             far as the part of  the route  over which the  Government has             control is concerned.                      In view of the great improvement in transport, and             for other reasons,  the demand for seats both on the  part of             visitors from Overseas and from the population  of  this             country. Is far in  excess of  the  demand which was  made             twenty-five years ago. It is quite obvious  that there is             no possibility,  either on the part of  the route within the             Governments jurisdiction or  elsewhere, of meeting more than             a fraction of the demand, and this in  spite  of  the fact that             in order to enable  more people to witness the procession,             His Majesty has agreed to a route considerably  longer than             that of previous occasions.   The  parts of the route  within             the Government&apos;s jurisdiction which are capable of the             largest scale development for seating  accommodation  are the             Mall,  Constitution  Hill,  and  the  East  Carriage Drive in Hyde             Park from Marble Arch  to  Hyde Park Corner.   But the  number             of seats which can  he  made available Is disappointing for             two reasons             (a)  The trees along the  route have grown since the  Coronatio:                              - 1  -
    of 1921,  and although it is hoped that  they will  not  be    in full leaf by the 12th May^  they none the leas  interfere    with the  erection of stands*(b)  The Coronation Executive Committee recommend that  nc stands    should be erected on the west  side of the East Carriage    Drive in  Hyde Parko        Although it is true that people standing in the    roadway more than ten or twelve deep are unlikely to  soe    much of the Procession, it I3  probable  that a vast  concourse    of people will assemble in Hyde Park, and even although  they    may &quot;be very many rows back from the Processional  route,  and    may see nothing &quot;but the top of a Lifeguardsman5s  helmet,  r    they would probably be very much annoyed if stands  wars    erected along this side of the roado 1 am inclined?  there--    fore, to  agree with the recommendation  of the Committee  that    no stands should be erected on the west side of this  roado    This; however., has the effect  of reducing by 36,000 seats    the possible amount of seating capacity which might be    provided;.  Having 2&apos;egard to the agitation which has already    started in the Press* and the  many appeals which  have been    made to me by deputations and  otherwise for the maximum    possible  amount of seating to  be provided,, 1 feel that I    must direct my colleagues&apos; attention to this decisions as    it may lay us open to strong criticism  for not using, in    the face  of an unexampled demand, what  opportunities we    have of providing seats..        The number of seats which can be provided, apart  fromthe abovep total, in round figursBp approximately 66,000* Sofar as the general public demand is concerned this number -  creven 110,000 if the seats J have alluded to above were provided -is only a drop in the ocean5 and neither figure will  go more
 thojn a very smal2 way  in meeting even  the demands of that section of  the public which has? so to a peak.-,  official or quasi-official claims for thw Government&apos;s consideration^        Ho seats erected by the government  in these circumstances.; can bs made available for purchase indiscriminately by the general publico  I have interviewed representatives of Ticket Agencies and Travel Associations, who pleaded strongly that not less than 20,000 seats should be made available  for that purposes but I am satisfied that if these were allotted  to these Associations? the majority of the seats would at once be sold to visitors from foreign countries, and that the ordinary &quot;man in the street5 would have very little chance of obtaining any of thenu  One firm alone stated that they already had applications for seme 80,000. and another stated that he would allot them to those who made use frequently of his Travel organisation  As any number such as 20,000 seats would be swallowed up almost as soon as they had been allotted to Ticket Agenciesj such a  sale  of seats would do little to stop excessive prices being charged for seats in shops and buildings? and?,  indeeds might have the opposite effect-        The Executive Committee have recommended also that no attempt should be made to erect a stand for sale at high figures for the benefit of Hospitals or other cuaritieso  They have con- curred in my proposal that all seats should be sold at a price approximately 50$ above cost?  the balance being allotted toHospitals or other charities as may be approved by the Treasury and Office of Works in consultationa  this s I hope, will tend to obviate the charge that privileged persona could obtain seats atmuch too low a price? and? incidentally? should raise a larger sum of money for charities than if one or more stands were erected with seats available for sale at a high price on thosem g ICQ
stands only.  In advance of tenders it  is not possibleto say what the cost price of seats will be? but Ienvisage the sale of seats at about thirty shillingsto two pounds each.        Although I understand that at past Coronations theFirst Commissioner of Works has undertaken the sole respon-sibility of allocating the seats on the stands to view thsCoronation Procession^ I have thought it rights in thecircumstances of todays to seek the advice of thsCoronation Executive Committee on the subject..  They have set up a subcommittee for the purposes with whosedeliberations,, through ny representative upon its I havebeen in continuous touch.  The committee have prepared adraft a3 location of seats which I submit in the accompanyingappendix for ths information of ny colleagues^  It is not intended in any sense as final at this stage, though Ishould aay that I have myself 9 with the Earl Llarshal andthe Ohairnan of the Allocation Sub-Caomitteej had certainnegotiations rxith ths High Commissioners for the dominions in ths natter of the allocation to the Dominions,; sjndgthough the means at our disposal are naturally not sufficientto satisfy all their needss we have secured their agreement to ths figures shorni in the drafts        The aim has been to distribute seats for sale to representatives as far as possible of avery phase of thenation9s activities.  It will be seen that the distribution
coyers not only Members of Parliament,  the Civil and DefendServices, and the London Boroughs? as well as visitors fromOverseas9 but also representatives of Organised Labour,Werner/s Organisations, Provincial Municipal Bodies, Trades,Commerces and the likeu        I would ask the cabinet it) whether? in the face of the exceptional&apos; demand for    seats? they agree with the proposal not to use for    this purpose any part of the Park side of the East    Carriage Drives(S) for their agreement in principle to the allocation of    the 85,000 seats on the lines recommended in the    accompanying draft.I recommend both these proposals.-.HoMo Office of Works eto*    30 th October9 1938.
