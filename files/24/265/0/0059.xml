Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1936.SECRET.CP. 339  (36).CABINET.THE  BALANCE  OF  PAYMENTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.                Note by the President of the Board of Trade.    I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum prepared  at my request by theChief Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government.    The first part of the memorandum deals with our present balance of payments.It suggests that in the year now ending we may find we have incurred a slightadverse balance.  Such a result (which only represents the position at one moment in time of a running account) need not in itself be alarming; and the memorandumshows that our increased imports are due largely to our improved home position,and partly to  &quot;refugee&quot; money.  It is therefore suggested that the remedy-apart from any weakening  of  our exchange should be sought  in increased exports.  These conclusions will be found on page 5    The second part deals with our export trade.  It indicates some limitingfactors to the success of our protective and preferential policy.  It suggests, inconclusion, some general principles which we should bear in mind in consideringour commercial and industrial policy.  These will be found on pages 15 and 16.    I do not think the  questions  dealt with call for any specific decisions atpresent; but I  find myself in general agreement with the conclusions which sir frederick Leith-Ross draws, and I hope my colleagues will bear them in mind as and when occasion arises.

SECRET.MEMORANDUM  ON THE BALANCE  OF  PAYMENTS.(By the Chief Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government.)                 PART I.-ANALYSIS  OF IMPORT STATISTICS.The value of our overseas trade.    During the first nine months of 1936, imports into Great Britain amountedto  608 - 0 millions, an increase of  68 - 6 millions in comparison with the sameperiod of 1935.  This increase was  offset to the extent of   5-0 millions by  anincrease in exports of imported goods.  During the same period exports of british goods at  320 -1 millions showed an increase of only  8 - 3 millions, with the resultthat the visible adverse balance of trade rose  from  187-1 millions  to  242-4millions, an increase of  55-3 millions.Changes in volume and price.    2.  The usual analysis prepared by the Board of Trade indicates that in thefirst nine months  of 1936 the increase in imports was caused by an expansion inthe volume of imported goods retained in this country by 8-2 per cent., comparedwith 1935, accompanied by a rise in their average prices of  4 - 3 per cent.  Exportsof British goods, however, increased only by 1 - 2 per cent, in volume, and in priceby 1-3 per cent.Increase in different categories of imports.    3.  About half of the increase in the volume of retained imports is accountedfor by increased  imports of raw  materials, which fluctuate in  accordance withthe level of industrial activity in this country.  During the years 1933 and 1934the retained imports of raw materials were  on a rather  higher scale than was justified by the increase of production.   In  the first nine months of 1935  theimports were relatively rather low, as it was possible to draw upon stocks built  upin the two preceding years.  This special source of supply was no longer availablein 1936 and it is natural that the increase in raw material imports this year shouldbe  rather  larger than the  increase  in  production^  Imports   of  foodstuffsincreased by 4 per cent, in volume,  as a result of increased purchasing power dueto better employment.  Imports of manufactured goods which, of course, includemany raw materials in  a semi-manufactured  state,  or manufactured goods(e.g.,  machine  tools) which  are essential for  other branches of production,increased in volume by 8 per cent.   The  volume of retained imports of oil wasabout the same and that of non-ferrous metal in a refined state declined; but therewere substantial increases in volume in respect of other classes of manufacturedgoods.   The outstanding increases were  in respect of iron  and steel goods and machinery.    * The indices for the volume of imports of raw materials and the volume of production of manufacturing industries (i.e., excluding coal mining)  were as follows:-                     (Average of the years 1928 to 1935=100.)

The effect of price changes.    4.  The increase in the price of our imports was a material  factor in theincrease in  their value  during the first nine months of the year.   Of the  total increase in  the value of retained imports  of   63-7  millions in the first  nine months of the  year  21 millions was due to higher prices.   This increase was distributed  among the different classes as follows,  foodstuffs, &amp;c,  10 millions;raw  materials   4 millions;  manufactured goods   7 millions.  A  relativeworsening of our terms  of trade is a natural outcome of the improved position of primary producers which has followed the general  recovery in world productionin the last few years.  Just as at the onset of the depression, the prices of primaryproduce showed a relatively large fall,  so in the period of recovery they may beexpected to  rise faster than those of  other goods.Failure of exports of manufactured goods to expand adequately.    5.  Changes in the imports and exports  of  foodstuffs  and raw materialsduring  the first nine  months of 1936 together  accounted for an increase in the adverse balance of trade amounting to  43-0 millions.   It might have been hopedthat, as a result of the improved position of the countries from which we import,there would have been at the same time an increase in the favourable balance oftrade in the third class of goods, namely, manufactured  goods, which, with the help of an increase in  the &quot; invisible &quot; elements in the balance of payments, wouldhave sufficed to offset  the increased payments required under the first two classes.In  the  event, however,  there  has  actually been a worsening of our favourable balance of trade in manufactured goods to the extent of  11-7 millions.Some reasons for this  failure.    6.   5-5 millions of this increase is attributable to heavier imports, associatedwith only slightly greater exports, of investment goods.   The  strain placed on the productive  capacity  of  the  British  industries concerned  by the  rearmament programme  and the industrial demand for new equipment is responsible for this result.  The balance of  the increase is attributable to  the higher prices we  havebeen called  upon to pay for our imports of non-ferrous metals and oils in therefined  state, and to  the increased demand for manufactured timber  caused  bythe continued development of building activity.   The other classes of goods showonly a small change on  balance, though, of course, the proportionate increase innet imports  is very much greater than  in exports.  The failure of exports in these classes to expand more rapidly is disappointing.  It appears  to be due in part toa relative rise in sterling prices, and in part to  the effects of trade restrictions inforeign markets, but  in part, at any  rate, it appears to be due to the fact thatmanufacturers  in many lines, but particularly in the Engineering trades, are sobusy with domestic orders that they are unwilling or unable to press their exports.Causes of increase in  the adverse balance of trade.    7.  The conclusion which emerges from the preceding examination is thatthere have been four factors at work to increase this country&apos;s adverse  balance oftrade during the course of the current year :  First,  greater industrial activity and purchasing power in this country has led to a greater volume of imports of foodstuffs, raw materials and manufactured  goods, the principal value of which lies in their raw material content.  Secondly,  the  prices of these  imports  have risen  as the abnormally depressed position of primary producers has improved.Thirdly, the rearmament programme,  coupled with internal trade activity, whichhas strained the capacity of a number of important exporting industries, has ledto increased imports of competing  products.   Finally,  the same  causes  havediminished the incentive to press the  sale of British goods abroad in the face offoreign trade restrictions and currency risks,  and, as a consequence, the expansionof our exports has been checked.The state of the balance of payments.    8.  The increase in the  adverse  balance of trade  arising from these causesis great enough to direct attention to the present state of the balance of payments.Excluding special receipts on account of silver, there was last year an estimatedfavourable balance  of payments amounting to   22 millions.  It seems likely atthe moment that the visible adverse balance of  trade will  be not less  than
 60 millions greater than the adverse  balance last year.  This estimate allowsonly for a comparatively small increase in the adverse balance of trade in thelast quarter of the year; for the heavy  flow of imports began in September  and october 1935.   Part of this increase will be offset by improvements in the invisibleitems in the balance of payments, particularly in respect of shipping and receipts from overseas investments.  It is, however, unlikely that these will produce animprovement exceeding   30  millions.   This  suggests that,  in place  of  the favourable balance estimated at  22 millions last year, there will be an adverse balance of payments this year  in the neighbourhood of  10 millions:Capital movements and the balance of payments.     9.  An adverse balance of  payments means that for the time  being  themovement of capital is in our favour, i.e., more foreign capital is being transferredto our  market than British  capital transferred  abroad.   Whether  this  is  a dangerous situation or not depends on circumstances.  When we were on the goldstandard, we had constantly to protect our gold reserves against an adverse drainby raising the bank rate and  attracting short-term  foreign funds to London bythe offer of high  rates of interest, even at the risk of discouraging domesticinvestment; meanwhile,  we continued  to  issue  long-term foreign loans on  aconsiderable scale,  with  the result that when confidence was shaken  our assetswere not sufficiently liquid to meet our liabilities.   The position to-day is entirely different.   We  are no longer tied to gold, but our  reserves to meet a foreigndrain are very  substantial.  We  have made no attempt to attract foreign short-term funds by offering high rates of interest; indeed, our money rates have beenlower  than those  of  any European country.   Meanwhile, we have tried to discourage the investment of British capital abroad by the control of new capitalissues, and the  amount of such issues has been substantially less than  the repay-ments which we have received on account of the foreign loans  which we  haveissued in the past.  It is  true that the control  of  new capital  issues does not preclude private transfers of funds, which have  been freely invested abroad,especially in the New York market; and that the falling off in new capital issuesis due more to the absence of credit-worthy foreign borrowers than to  the officialrestrictions; but these restrictions, so far as they were  operative, have tended toincrease the plethora of  funds seeking  investment at home, and thus  to give anadditional stimulus to  domestic trade production, while,  at the same time,strengthening the value of sterling.   In the main, however, the inflow of capitalhas been due to the lack of confidence felt by the gold bloc countries  in their  owncurrencies, and London has for the time being become a place of refuge for largeamounts of French, Dutch and Swiss money.  This  flight of capital  to Londonhas tended to strengthen sterling in terms  of other currencies,  and thus to raisesterling prices  in  relation to world prices, with  adverse effects on the tradeposition, not only of the United  Kingdom, but of the whole sterling area.   the devaluation of  the  continental currencies has already led to a certain readjust-ment of the dollar-sterling exchange, and if confidence is  re-established in thecontinental currencies, the flight of capital  should be reversed, and the tendenciesthereby caused should correct themselves.Methods of correcting an adverse balance of payments.     10  In such circumstances an adverse balance of  10 million is, in itself, of little importance and is probably much more than  offset by the realised profits made on capital investments abroad (which are not  included in our estimates ofinvisible receipts).  What  is important is  the trend, and if the adverse balanceseems likely to  continue  the question arises whether any steps should or can betaken to correct it.     This  might be effected in a  number of ways.   First the relative  growth ofindustrial activity in  the  sterling area might be checked by  bringing about astiffening of  interest rates  in  this  country;  secondly,  the importation ofcompetitive goods  into  the  United Kingdom  might be  reduced  by  higherprotective duties;  thirdly,  sterling might be allowed to depreciate slightly withthe object of stimulating exports from the sterling area as a whole; and, finally,special measures might be taken to stimulate exports from the  United Kingdom.The first alternative is clearly  not appropriate  in present  conditions.   Thesubordination of the cheap money policy to exchange  considerations  could  only
 be justified in much more serious conditions than the present.   The choice, if it must be made, lies between checking the importation of competitive goods, and taking some steps to encourage exports.  The criterion which should be adopted is the probable efficiency of moderate measures in either direction. Imports and employment.     11.  Restrictions  on imports are usually advocated on the ground  that they will benefit employment. An increase of imports, whether of competitive or non- competitive goods, withdraws money from circulation in internal trade and is for that reason normally prejudicial to employment.  But if, as appears to be the case in this country  to-day, the increase in imports  is  largely a consequence  of increasing employment and business activity at home, import restrictions will not necessarily have the effect desired. It may be observed that throughout the period in which imports have been expanding, employment in this country and employ- ment in manufacturing industries in particular has been expanding rapidly.  In the case of manufacturing and mining industries indeed, although accurate results will not be available until the result of the July count is known,  it seems probable that employment in August was about 6 per cent, higher than a year before. Domestic disadvantages arising from the restriction of imports.     12.  Moreover, any restrictions on imports that could be imposed would apply only to a very small share  of  our  total imports,  and would therefore have to have a relatively very large effect  on that share.  Investigation into the nature of imports of manufactured goods leads to  the conclusion that probably no more than 40 per cent, of these should properly be classed as competitive.  As all manu- factured goods only amounted to a  quarter of  all  imports  in 1935, only 10 per cent, of our total imports were of a competitive nature ;* and it is obvious that a very drastic limitation of these imports would be required to produce an appre- appreciable  effect on  the balance of  payments.   Moreover, within  the category  of competitive goods are  included many in the production of which the existing British industries are working at  or near their full capacity.  Important instances of these are to be  found among iron and steel goods, in certain classes of machinery, and in many building materials.   To exclude these goods, which are essential in subsequent stages  of  manufacture, would   retard the development of British industrial activity.  Of the remaining competitive imports, many are of a highly specialised character, the demand for which is so inelastic that their importation would probably continue even though the tariff against them was extremely high. Finally,  with  industry in  many divisions approaching  boom conditions,  the importation, or even the threat of importation of foreign goods provides a useful corrective for the tendency of industrial prices and profits to become unduly high. Restriction on imports unsuitable in present circumstances.     13.  For these reasons, the restriction of imports does not appear an advisable remedy for the comparatively small  adverse balance of payments with which we are to-day faced.  It  could certainly not be made effective without raising our, tariffs  to a point where we would become definitely a high protectionist country and run the risk of finding tariffs raised against our own exports abroad. More- over, such a measure of protection as would enable us to dispense with  increased imports during  a  period of  great  internal trade  activity, accompanied by  a rearmament programme, would almost inevitably involve us in a large expendi- ture of capital on  domestic plant and equipment,  which as soon as the present exceptional activity diminished  would  prove redundant.   It is more  advisable to meet part of the special requirements of the moment by means of additional imports, even if they involve some temporary adverse balance of payments, than to sink capital in new installations  for whose  capacity there will be no prospect of permanent employment and whose  existence will in  the future make it more difficult for the existing plants to maintain their position. Exchange adjustment.     14.  The  preferable course seems to  be to meet the adverse balance of payments by other means, and, in particular, by allowing the exchange to adjust itself  as it may  be expected to do,  to  a slightly lower level, provided that this adjustment is not, large enough to affect internal costs materially.   This method                     * For details  of this analysis, see Appendix I.
has the advantage of operating on a very wide field, viz., the trade of the wholesterling area;  so that a relatively small deviation in the balance of payments canbe corrected by a small change in the level of the exchanges.  It is difficult, in thecircumstances  surrounding the depreciation of the franc, to distinguish the effects of capital movements from those arising from transactions on income account andthe question whether,  and to what extent, sterling is at present over-valued  is open to considerable differences of  opinion.  It should be  remembered  that thebalance of payments of the United States is deteriorating even more rapidly thanthat of this country, and if sterling is over-valued to-day,  it may be that it  is over-valued in terms of other currencies rather than of the United States dollar.But if in  fact  the adverse tendency  of our balance of payments continues, it maybe expected sooner or later to lead to pressure on the sterling exchange,  and anyuntoward consequences can then be adjusted by allowing the exchange to yield  tothis pressure.The expansion of exports.    15.   For  the  rest,  the  balance  of  payments should  be adjusted by  an expansion in our exports.  The improvement in the position of primary producersmust  eventually lead  to  increased  demands  for manufactured goods  in thosecountries, and it is  important that our export trade should be in  a position  toobtain their proper share of any such increased demands.  The recent tendenciesin our export  trade, and the questions whether it is maintaining its competitive position and whether  any steps can usefully be taken to stimulate  it, raise anumber of further considerations which will be dealt  with in the second part  ofthis memorandum.Conclusions.    16.   My conclusions, therefore, are that      (a) two-thirds  of the increase in the  unfavourable balance of trade is due           to  increased  demand  for foodstuffs  and  raw  materials   directly           necessitated by the activity of internal trade;     (b) of the remaining one-third,  a  large proportion  represents  manu-           factures  which we  cannot economically  supply;     (c)  the increase of prices of these  commodities, which has contributed  to           the adverse balance of  trade, will improve  the  financial position  of           the producing countries and lead to an increase of their demand for           manufactured goods;     (d) the increase in the adverse balance of trade will be partly compensated           by  an increase, of our invisible receipts  from  shipping, foreign           investments, &amp;c,  but  there will probably be an adverse  balance  of           payments this year amounting to about   10 millions.     (e)  This  adverse balance should not be corrected by increasing money rates.           It  is, in  part, the result of an  influx of refugee money from Europe           which will  eventually  be withdrawn.    ^f) Nor would additional restrictions  on imports be effective, having regard           to  the comparatively small proportion of the additional imports which           we  can  restrict  without adversely  affecting  our  own industrial           activities.     -(g)  The  natural  adjustment of the adverse balance, if it persists, should           be found in a moderate depreciation of the exchange, such as  may           be expected  to follow  a  revival  of confidence in  the  European           currencies.     -(h)  For  the rest, the remedy should  be found  in  an expansion of our           exports which is dealt with  in the second part of this memorandum.
                      PART II. ANALYSIS OF EXPORTS.1. Analysis by classes of exports.    The failure of exports of manufactured goods to expand  more rapidly isdisappointing.  One reason for this has already been touched upon, namely, thefact that the iron and steel and  engineering  industries,  for  whose  productsoverseas demand was, up to 1935, most elastic, have been  benefiting from a very strong home demand  and from  government orders for armaments.  Exports ofthese  industries are not expanding  as fast as they have done up to this year, asmanufacturers are now  so busy at home that they are ceasing to press for orders from  overseas.Exports of United Kingdom goods.(  millions.)	-1 1929. i 1931. i		1933.	1935.

In1936, however, there was not much difference in their rate of expansion and inthat of the products of other industries.2.  Analysis of export outlets.    The Ottawa agreements and the trade agreements negotiated since 1931 withcertain  foreign countries have helped us to maintain  our export  trade withinthe areas covered by these agreements, but have caused a considerable diversion of British trade.  During the earlier years of the recovery this diversion assistedour export trade because it secured for this country a large share in the expandingdemand for goods in the countries of the sterling area, in which  an expansivemonetary policy was being pursued.  Recovery has by now reached a high levelwithin  the  sterling area, and  the scope for  further expansion of  trade  isconsequently greatest in the countries outside the sterling  area.   One effect,however, of the preference which this country has secured in British marketsoverseas and of  the favourable position secured in the  countries  with which wehave negotiated trade agreements, has been  to accentuate  the force of foreigncompetition in those markets where we have not secured a specially favourable position; and British exporters  have failed to  benefit  materially  from theexpansion of  demand which is now  apparent outside the sterling area.   Thefollowing tables illustrate the fortune of British export trade since 1929, in thethree  different groups of countries, namely, British countries; trade agreementcountries  (Denmark,  Norway, Sweden,  Finland,  Latvia,  Lithuania, Estonia,Poland, Holland, Russia and the Argentine*)  and other  foreign  countries.

Of this decline  7-1 millions are accounted forby Italy and Spain, where special circumstances prevail.-Comparison, between British and  German exports.     3.  The most  serious competition which British exporters are meeting  in neutral markets comes from Germany and Japan.  Exports from Germany arebeing assisted by a number of devices, including direct subsidies,  which in spiteof her high domestic  prices enable her exporters to compete on very favourable terms.  Germany has also used the machinery of Clearings successfully,  first,to procure imports on credit and thereafter to secure outlets for her exports.  TheTesult has been that Germany has secured the  greater part of the recent increase    * The trade agreements differ greatly in importance and to some extent  in. nature, but ithas been thought  best to group together the countries concerned, without  regard to  these differences. The classification above is not perhaps strictly accurate.

The above figures should not, however, be taken as meaning that Germany hasbeen more successful than we have been in maintaining export trade, as comparedwith the pre-1931 position.  On the contrary, she is, both absolutely and relatively,in a worse plight.  In view of the differences in the currency policies of the twocountries,  any  comparison on the basis of  values is misleading.   The  bestcomparison is probably the relative changes in the volume of exports when price changes have been eliminated.   The decline for Germany in 1935 relative to 1929was 46 per cent,  and in the United Kingdom  25 per Gent.   But 1929 was muchmore of a  peak year for German exports than for  United Kingdom exports; andGerman exports  have expanded by about 13  per  cent, this year as against anincrease of only 1 per cent, for the United Kingdom, Germany is therefore tending to improve her relative position but this recent expansion in German exports isvery largely an effort on the part of Germany to  regain ground which she had previously lost.Summary  of difficxdties.    4.  The difficulties in the expansion of our export trade may be ascribed toa number  of causes of varying importance:     (a)  The diverse capital movements which have affected the exchanges during          the past year have  probably  led to some over-valuation of sterling,          resulting in  making this country a more attractive market to  sell in          than  to buy from.    (&amp;)  Apart from exchange rates, the marked revival of internal trade and the          boom which has now developed in many manufacturing industries are          causing  British prices to rise, affecting both current orders and still          more tenders for future orders.    (c)&apos; The same factors are  leading  to an  increasing diversion of enterprise,          skilled labour and productive capacity to supplying home demands in          preference to export trade.    (d)  This tendency  to concentrate on the domestic market is furthered  by the          difficulties of doing profitable export business in face of foreign  quotas          and exchange restrictions.in trade not only in Eastern Europe but also in a number of South American andAsiatic markets which has followed the more vigorous demand for raw materials.British exports have only made headway in  those  markets  where  Germancompetition is a   secondary  matter.   This  point is  clearly  illustrated  bystatistics of the broad geographical distribution of British and German tradein the first half of  1935 and 1936.
     (e) Apart from trade restrictions, clearing and compensation arrangements           have affected our exports to many countries, and particularly to those           countries with which we have a favourable balance of payments.     (/) But these impediments are, largely, the reflection of a wider difficulty,           viz. :  the diminution in the exports and purchasing power of foreign           countries (and particularly of many European countries) caused by           the world crisis and accentuated by the measure of protection adopted           by the United Kingdom and by the other principal creditor countries.     (g) The effect of the crisis on primary producing countries; both  European           and  overseas, has been to accentuate the development of  domestic           industries, which will permanently affect the market in these countries           for imports of consumers&apos;  goods  (especially  textiles,  clothing, and           light metal products) though it may lead to additional demands for           capital equipment.     (h) Our policy, by establishing a preferential or favourable position for our           exports to the Empire and to the  countries with which  we have           negotiated Trade Agreements, has accentuated the competition which           we have to face in other countries, particularly in South America and           the Far East, where the scope for expansion of trade is now most           marked.     ii) The competition of Germany has been particularly severe and  has  been           aided not only  by  clearing and  compensation  agreements but by           subsidies and  liberal credit terms.     In the following paragraphs, these difficulties are examined in turn with aview to seeing whether any  means can be suggested for meeting them.              fThe Value of Sterling.     5.  It is not easy to estimate the precise extent to which British exports mayhave been affected by changes in the gold value of the pound during the past year.From March to October this  year the gold value of the  pound was rather higherthan in the corresponding  months of  1935 a  circumstance  discouraging to exports though lower than in 1934.  Since the devaluation of the franc the goldvalue of the pound has again declined and is now  slightly lower than it has ever been before at this season of the year.   If the only factors affecting the exchangeswere those which enter into  the annual balance  of payments, the position wouldbe comparatively simple.  A markedly adverse balance of payments  would befollowed by a depreciation of the pound and that in turn would favour exports and discourage imports, thus tending to restore the  balance of  payments toequilibrium.   But in  practice  the effect  of  the  balance of payments on theexchanges may for long periods be outweighed by the influence of more powerfulfactors.  The course of the exchange in the last  year has clearly depended in themain on movements of capital  in great volume, inwards to  this country from europe and  outwards from  this country to the United States.  These factors and  the operations  of  the Exchange  Equalisation Account have exercised amore important influence than the balance of payments.  As regards the future,a decline  in  the value of the pound  from whatever cause would for a time atleast tend to favour exports;  and should the return flow  of capital to theEuropean countries which have recently devalued assume important proportions,the  tendency might be  in  that direction.  But  we  must  now anticipate anincrease of competition both in the home and in the export market from continentalindustries, especially as regards textiles.  It would not be possible, or desirable,to attempt to meet this  competition by a deliberate depreciation of the pound.During the past year the terms of trade with the raw material producing countries have turned against us and prices of raw materials have risen substantially interms  of  sterling.   There is every  reason  to  expect that  this rise will bemaintained and may. be  substantially  increased.  In such conditions any  largedepreciation  of sterling  would  tend  to increase costs  of production so far as these relate to  raw materials while at the same  time  increasing  the  prices of foodstuffs.  As a result of the present shortage of skilled labour and the great increase of industrial profits, demands for increased wages must be expected insome industries, but if a substantial rise should occur in the cost of living/these demands might be widespread and difficult to resist.  We must at all costs avoid
 getting  involved  in the vicious spiral  of increased  prices, increased wages, increased costs and increased  depreciation of currency, and  no  improvement  in our export trade could compensate us for the ill-effects of such a  situation.  Any depreciation of the pound must therefore be kept within moderate limits. Domestic Trade Revival.     6.   The effects of  the  revival of  domestic trade activity  on the export situation are manifold and difficult to counteract.  In the first  place  there has been a definite rise of British prices and though this rise does not at present represent any  large proportion of total costs the tendency  is increasing, with the result that not only are a number of  British exports becoming  relatively dear but manufacturers are  hesitating to quote  for orders involving delivery  in the future without including  a  substantial margin for increase of costs.   The rise  in  prices  particularly  affects iron  and steel  and  engineering   products generally.   In the case of the export trade in iron and  steel products themselves, the position  as  regards both quantities and prices is governed by the agreement between the  British Iron and  Steel Federation and the Continental Cartel, and the Federation  has set up a special organisation  to ensure  that our producers export up to the full amount of the quotas to which they  are entitled under the agreement in overseas markets.  As regards the home markets, the Import Duties Advisory Committee have constantly emphasised  that the protection of  the  home industry was conditional on its pursuing a policy aimed at large output and low prices, and assurances were obtained from the Federation that they would follow this policy.   None the less, on the basis of costs,  several  substantial rises have been agreed  to.  At the same time the  Federation have  agreed to substantial increases of  imports where a marked shortage has been  felt; and the bringing of new plant into production towards the end of this year should  increase supply and tend to  keep  prices down.   But the situation should be watched to ensure that the protection of the home iron and steel industry is not carried so far as to prejudice the export trade dependent on it.  Arrangements have been made for special rebates to British shipbuilders but these rebates cannot extend to branches of  the industry where the  raw material represents a less important  part of the total costs, and this is one of the factors which  is tending to raise the  price of iron and steel manufactures generally.   Every effort should be made to  counter- act this  tendency.  The  improvement which is now taking place in the position of  primary producers  should, before long,  be  reflected in an increased demand for manufactured goods, of which a considerable proportion  should be  satisfied by increased exports from the United Kingdom.  But we can only hope  to obtain our share of this increased trade if we keep our prices on a competitive basis. Effect of rearmament programme.     7.  The  development of  the  rearmament programme,  coming on top of thegeneral industrial revival,  has-created a great demand for skilled labour, and difficulties have  arisen in obtaining normal deliveries from  sub-contractors.  This has been put forward by some  of our export industries as the reason for delays in carrying out  existing contracts or for hesitating to tender for new contracts. Such delays are very detrimental to our export business.  It is  difficult to estimatehow far the  reasons given are justified and how far they represent excuses bymanufacturers  who have been adversely  affected by  the  rise in prices.  The rearmament programme cannot be said, up to the present,  to  have involved sucha direct  demand as in itself to cause prejudice to the export industries except in special cases, e.g., machine tools.  Nevertheless, the indirect  effects are probablybeginning to be felt and it is important to secure that the rearmament programme should not lead to a disorganisation of our export connections.   In the  case of machine tools at a meeting at which representatives of the Service departments were present, Sir Thomas  Inskip and  the industry accepted a  proposal under which &amp;2\ millions out of an estimated  production  of   8  millions would  be allocated for exports.  It was also agreed that if the Service requirements  were so  urgent as to demand delivery within  periods which  would prevent  suchallocation, then  such of their demands  as could not be satisfied  should  be filled by&apos; additional imports.  The  industry  are now endeavouring  to  work out  ascheme to give practical effect to this principle.  It is very desirable that similar arrangements should be  made  with other branches of  industry  affected by theDefence  Programme.
&quot; Export Weariness.&quot;    8.  But what is probably the most difficult factor to deal with is the diversion of interest and energy from exports to the more profitable home  market.   Thesame  phenomenon was observed  in Germany after the inauguration of the Naziprogramme of internal revival.   The clumping of German exports which had been going on during the preceding period of deflation suddenly stopped and german industry suffered  from what was  described  as &quot; export weariness.&quot;  The measures taken by Germany to counteract this tendency are referred to later on, but mostof these measures are not easy for us to imitate, and everything should be doneby the trade organisations to maintain interest in export markets.  The Presidentof the Board  of  Trade, speaking at the Dinner of  the London Iron and SteelExchange, dealt with this question in  the following terms :          &apos;&apos; At the present time  many  industries in  this country,  including the    iron and  steel  industry, are fully  occupied with the revived home  demand,    coupled with the  requirements of the rearmament  programme,  which are    now beginning to be felt.         &quot; There is a temptation, in these circumstances, to industrialists to fill    up their  order books with these  profitable and safe home  orders to the    exclusion of  the export trade.  This can  become a short-sighted policy.         &quot; The time may possibly come when the present lively  home demand    will begin to fall  off.   The time will  certainly  come when the rearmament    programme is completed and what I  may call large capital orders become    replacement orders.         &quot; Let our  industries see to it that when that time comes  they have not    lost their export connections.  I strongly commend to industrialists the  long    view that export trade should be maintained and expanded.....         &quot; There must be  no   failure on  our part to  strengthen  our trade    connections overseas and to maintain  our reputation for the quality of our    products, the integrity of our merchants and manufacturers, and last, and by    no means least, the punctuality of our deliveries.&quot;Foreign Trade Barriers.    9.   The network of restrictions imposed by foreign countries in the form ofquotas,  exchange  controls,  clearings  and  compensation  arrangements  have undoubtedly  affected  both the  possibilities of exports and  the interest of ourmanufacturers in exporting, particularly to Central and Eastern Europe.  Wherebusiness has been possible, losses have  too often occurred as a result of exchangedifferences.   In some cases, the foreign restrictions were imposed  in  order tomaintain the currency at  an artificial level, and it may be hoped that, as a resultof the readjustment of currencies which has recently taken place, some of these restrictions may  be removed.  In other cases,  the restrictions have been imposed in order to limit  the volume of imports to the  amounts that can be  paid  for,  and,where this is  the case, we cannot justifiably complain of the effects on our exporttrade,:  indeed, in some  cases, e.g.,  Germany and Italy,  we have definitelyrecognised the  reasonableness   of such  limitations.  In  general, the  foreignrestrictions  in question cannot  be removed until the countries in  question  havetaken the necessary steps to restore equilibrium to their national economy.Fall in Purchasing power of foreign countries.                              -    10.   This readjustment  must  be carried  through  by  the governmentsconcerned : but the difficulties,  which they have to remedy, are partly due to our policy.   In the effort to promote domestic and Empire industry and agriculture,we have, since 1931, steadily reduced the proportions of our imports derived fromthe Continent of Europe and  increased  the proportion derived  from  Empiresources.  The result of our efforts to alleviate the strain  on our  balance ofpayments has been to transfer part of  that strain to  some countries (bothEuropean and overseas)  with far less  financial and  economic resources than we ourselves possessed, and we are now feeling the inevitable reaction on our own position of the reduction in their purchasing power caused by this and other factors.   The standard of living in some of the countries of Eastern Europe has fallen to the position of a century ago  : and in such  conditions we cannot expect the same market for our goods as we used  to find there.  This may not be due somuch to the direct fall in their exports to the  United Kingdom as to the indirect
effect of the fall in exports of connected countries, e.g., Germany, through whom they were able formerly to obtain foreign exchange resources.  Germany has (aswill be explained hereafter) used her purchasing power in these markets to secureClearing and Compensation Arrangements, but in the main  these arrangementsmerely expedite and  crystallise  in a rigid form the working of  the ordinaryeconomic law that a country cannot sell its exports and collect its debts unless itaccepts payment in goods.  As a long range policy, the possibility of recovery inthe export industries, and specially in those associated with Central  and eastern european  trade, depends essentially  on  restoring  the  purchasing power  of continental Europe,  and this can,  in the long run, only be achieved by allowingan expansion of their export  to other countries,  and particularly to the UnitedKingdom.Unde sir ability of further restrictions on imports from foreign countries.    11.  So far as we are concerned, the internal revival in the United kingdom has now reached a point when further restrictions on imports from Europe  arelikely to do us positive harm, both  by accentuating the disparity of prices in  theUnited Kingdom and  by reducing the outlets for our exports to the markets whereexpansion  is still possible.  There are signs that  some at least of the Dominionsare beginning to realise that their  recovery, too, cannot be carried much  furtherunless they can  resume their former trade with  Europe,* and it may be hopedthat this may  lead  to a mitigation  of their demands  upon us for excessivepreferences in the United Kingdom market.  But the extent to which this countryin isolation can go towards restoring the situation in Europe is limited, as wecannot afford to revert to the pre-1931 conditions.    Our own economic  position particularly  vis-a-vis the  United States  ofAmerica is  far from strong,  and  permanent recovery in European trade  willrequire joint  action,- not only by ourselves and the European creditor countries(France, Switzerland  and Holland), but also  by  the United  States  of America.Such joint action will not be easy to realise, but in the meantime, as the countrymost interested in  securing such a recovery, we should take the lead  and do allthat we can to promote such joint action, even if it involves some risk; and if wecan do nothing more, we should at least refrain from increasing our protectivesystem.Industrialisation of primary producing countries.    12.  Meanwhile,  in  the  primary  producing  countries,  the  process   ofindustrialisation which has  been taking  place  since  the war has   been  greatlyaccentuated since the depression.   The reduction of their exports caused by  the increasing agrarian protectionism of Europe and the sudden cessation of foreignloans sharply curtailed the power  of these countries  to purchase manufacturedgoods  from abroad and stimulated  the  creation  and  development  of domesticindustries.  As  a consequence, there has been, and will continue to  be, a shift inthe character of the goods which they need to import.   They produce more, and,therefore,  import less, of their requirements  of  a number of consumers&apos; goods,    *  This aspect of commercial relations within the British Empire  on the one  hand, and between the Empire and  foreign countries on the other hand, was the subject of an interestingarticle in &quot; Planning &quot; last June, summarised in the November issue in the following terms :         &quot; We reached the conclusion that the Ottawa Agreements had assisted the Empire    countries to  weather the slump by diverting to each other as much as  possible of  the    trade which they had previously conducted with the outside world, but that this attempt to    &apos; pass the  buck&apos; to  foreign  countries,  although  in  the short run beneficial to British    interests and  of immediate benefit  to the Empire overseas, had tended  to arrest future    development.  We showed that the primary producing interests of the overseas Empire    must inevitably be far wider than the British market, and  that the industrial  and com-    mercial interests of Great Britain are far wider than  the market provided  by the overseas    Empire. We  expressed fears concerning the ultimate wisdom of a policy which, in face of    the traditional British conception of imperial trusteeship, has sought to exclude from the    Crown Colonies cheap manufactured articles which the United Kingdom  cannot supply    on competitive terms and which, by reason of their  low standard of life, Colonial popula-    tions urgently desire.  We urged that if the potential resources  of the   Dominions and    Colonies as raw material producers were to  be fully developed, and if British exports of    manufactured goods (together with British  invisible exports) (were  to  be restored  to    something like their pre-depression level, increased commerciaL intercourse with foreign    countries was essential.&quot;
notably textiles, clothing and certain  light metal products.   At the same time.their demand for  the capital  equipment necessary to these secondary industries.is expanding, and this is the explanation of the comparative success which up to1935 attended our export trade in  engineering products.   A second group of products, the demand for  which from abroad  is capable of great  expansion, isthat for the newer mechanical luxuries first developed in the United States afterthe war.     This group includes, in addition to motor cars, such goods as  wireless sets,typewriters,  domestic, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and a whole group of mechanical  domestic appliances.  In  this  second group, production in GreatBritain was  held back up to 1931, both by the over-valuation of  the  pound,  andby the  difficulty of  establishing domestic  industries without the  assistance ofprotection; but it is now expanding  rapidly.    The effects of  the rearmament programme have been felt with greatest force in the heavy  engineering industries;.but even in the light mechanical industries, capacity for export is comparatively small because of the growth of home demand.   Nevertheless, it is  to this group of industries that  we must look to replace the losses our export trade has suffered by reason of  the progressive closing of overseas markets to the goods of our olderindustries, and to the increasing competition of semi-industrialised countries,such  as  Japan.   These  light industries are for the most  part  situated in thesouthern parts of England, especially in and around London, where the tradition of exporting  is much less developed than in the north.  It is of the first importance that these industries should become export-minded, and  that they, no less  thanthe older engineering industries, should be encouraged to set aside some part oftheir production for the export market, in the hope that the connections so gainedwill be of great assistance if and when home trade shows signs of falling off.German penetration of &quot; neutral &quot; markets.     13.   The situation in the  &quot;  neutral &quot; markets of Asia and South America is affected by other factors also.  Here Japan has tended to increase her trade byreason of low prices and geographical propinquity.  We cannot hope to compete with Japan in the lines for which she is specially adapted.  But it  is not Japan,but  Germany, which has made  most progress recently in  these markets.   Thesuccess of Germany is due, partly, to the low prices which her exporters can quote,on the basis of export subsidies, partly to their readiness to accept payment in theform ofdoarter for local  products, and to the higher prices  they are prepared tooffer for these products, provided &quot; aski &quot; marks are accepted, partly to the grantof long and liberal credit  facilities, and partly to the energy and  enterprise oftheir export organisations.Siibsidies.     The subsidies granted to  German  exporters are an irritating factor becauseof their  arbitrary  character.   But the Reichsmark is probably overvalued by atleast 40 per cent,  and the main  effect of the subsidy is merely to counteract thedifference in  costs  arising  from  this overvaluation.  In any case, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could  not embark  on a policy of subsidising particular export trades,and  if counter-subsidies  are required to meet German competition  in particular cases, it is for the industries concerned, and not for His Majesty&apos;s Government, toorganize and finance them.Barter.     14.  Nor is it possible for  us to  counteract German competition based onbarter or compensation business.  As a creditor nation, it is not in our interests to adopt a tied-house system  for our trade. Moreover, barter transactions arenot, in general, economic, involving as they do the acceptance of goods at artificialprices and without the guarantees of quality that can be demanded in the open market.  There are grounds for  thinking that the German Government are nowtending to restrict the use of barter  transactions.Clearings.    15.   Clearing agreements  have been a valuable device for forcing out Germangoods, but only because, in the first instance,  they-  were  used  for  large-scaleimports into  Germany.   Owing to the shortage of  means of payment, Germany
) experienced  difficulties  in  acquiring imports in  the  normal markets.   These difficulties were reduced when Clearing Agreements were first instituted, as these agreements gave confidence to foreign traders and encouraged them to undertake deliveries to Germany against  a credit  in the Clearing account.  As a result, Germany bought supplies on an abnormal scale from the clearing countries  and soon accumulated debts on these clearings amounting to many millions of pounds. In order to liquidate these so-called  &quot;clearing arrears,&quot; and in some cases  also to secure payment of their financial claims, the other countries had  either to restrict their own exports to Germany or to encourage  German exports to them. This procedure of first taking a surplus of imports, and then making it a lever to force out exports,  has been used by Germany with marked success in  her commercial relations both with the Balkan  countries and with  South America recently. But it has not won Germany any goodwill, and now that the improving demand for  raw materials has opened alternative outlets to their produce, the producing countries are likely to resist this form of pressure more strongly. Credits.     16.  In  Asia, German exports have been greatly assisted by the readiness of their traders to undertake contracts  for capital equipment on the basis of payment spread over a long period of years.   These contracts have been financed in Germany  by advances  from  the German Banks  backed  by Government guarantees.  Such contracts are attractive to the German industrialists, as they thereby acquire a credit in foreign currency against a  liability in Reichsmarks, Avhich they no doubt hope one of these days to liquidate on profitable terms.   The business undertaken would, in  many cases, be regarded as risky by the more conservative  financiers in  this country,  but hitherto it has  apparently  proved successful, and there have been remarkably few bad debts to write off. Export Credits Facilities.     17.  In  this field it  is clear that  the  United Kingdom  should be in a favourable position to compete  with Germany.  Our financial resources are in every way superior to those of Germany.   What is lacking is the appropriate organisation and the spirit of enterprise.  The British banks have never engaged in financing long-term contracts in the same way as the German banks and have not the same close connexion with the manufacturing industries.  It is true that, e.g., in China, there have been special finance institutions which  have done such business, but these institutions have sustained heavy losses in the past and have been disinclined to launch out in new  ventures. The Export Credits Department, which should assist in carrying risks, has been perhaps unduly influenced by banking principles and has hesitated  to underwrite business in countries such as China,  where information as to credit risks is difficult to obtain.  They have now agreed  to send out a special representative to China, and it may be hoped that, as a  result of his recommendations, the Committee may adopt a more liberal policy. It is also to be hoped that the British Banks in the Far East will do more than they have recently to finance long-term contracts in that part of the world. Long-term Loans.                                   ?     18.  The London market is also peculiarly well organised for financing long- term loans and international trade wall not be fully restored without a resumption of foreign long-term lending.   It is a  question  for consideration whether in present circumstances  the restrictions on  foreign  lending need  be maintained. These restrictions are  not very effective as they do not apply to  private capital transactions, but in so far as they are operative,  they have tended to strengthen the position of sterling and to divert capital from foreign to home investment. We cannot, it is true, afford to indulge again in the policy of granting long-term loans to foreign borrowers purely on the basis of short-term funds which are only temporarily placed in London and which may be withdrawn at an inconvenientmoment.  But there is not, at present, any prospect of foreign loans being placedon the market in such volume as  to create any embarrassment for us.   If it isconsidered necessary to maintain some control of new issues, it should be possibleto relax the conditions under which issues can be  authorised, e.g., by requiring a smaller proportion of&apos; any loan to be expended on orders in the United Kingdom.
Efficiency of export organisations.     19.  The success of Germany  is also partly due  to the superiority of herexport organisations.  Young German engineers are prepared to go abroad andto rough it at salaries which would not attract any competent British engineers.They follow up openings and work out proposals with an energy and enterprisethat deserves success.  While some of our  export  organisations are equallyenergetic, others have fallen into decay or been dissolved, and the lack of interestin exports makes  it probable that this process will  continue.  Our industries should be encouraged to maintain their export agencies abroad in a high stateof efficiency and, if necessary, to combine representation for this purpose.Industrial agreements.    20.  Another  line of approach which would be helpful would  be to promoteindustrial agreements with our competitors, including both Germany and Japan.In a falling market,  such as existed between  1930 and 1935, it was difficult toavoid cut-throat competition.  But  it is not in the interests of producers in any country to export  at a loss and with the upward turn  which has taken place in world trade, it should be easier to negotiate working arrangements for a reasonableallocation of markets.  The Iron and Steel Cartel has  shown the way and everyeffort should be made,  as  opportunity occurs, to negotiate  similar agreements between other industries. It has recently been decided that it would be undesirableunder present conditions to make any official approach to the German Governmentfor the purpose of fostering such arrangements, but  that the United  Kingdomindustries should be urged to adopt this method as the solution of one of their most pressing problems.                                            aGermany^ export  policy contrasted with that of the United Kingdom.    21.  The situation  of  Germany is so  different from ours that it  would be unnecessary and undesirable for us to imitate all the  expedients which she hasadopted.  But it is worth while to contrast her policy with ours.   The german policy in industry is to encourage employment by State contracts and State credit,but to prevent this resulting in increased profits or wages.   The export traderanks with the armament requirements and domestic food supply programme inthe allocation of labour.  Dividends are strictly controlled and limited and leviesare imposed which are used to subsidise exports.  By these means the export tradeis encouraged at the expense of the home market.  Here, on the other hand, we donot control or limit dividends, we are not  able to organise our labour  supplies :and in general home trade has been stimulated in preference to the export trade.No doubt, the grant of subsidies to exports is  contrary to all  sound  economicprinciples  and is  justified  in  Germany  by  considerations  (e.g.,  the  artificialexchange value of  the Reichsmark) which do not apply to this country.  Never -theless, it is a question whether our heavy industries should not be  advised to set aside a definite proportion of their profits to an Export Fund  which  would be utilised to strengthen their export organisations, and, if necessary, to enable themto meet subsidised competition.   If no such action is taken, our  heavy export industries may in*a few years find it difficult to regain their share of the exporttrade: and  the mere suggestion of the intention  to create such a fund  mightinduce the Germans to come to an understanding with us for a reasonable alloca-tion of markets.    22.  My conclusion, therefore, is that the present position of our export tradeis the inevitable result of the policy which  we have followed,  with  great success,in promoting revival first in this country, and, secondly,  in the  Empire.  Wecannot expect our trade with the rest of the world to expand at the same rate, butwe should do all we can to maintain it,     (a) by keeping down our export prices and allocating a reasonable propor-           tion of our manufacturing capacity to  exports,  even at the cost of           additional imports to meet emergency demands;
