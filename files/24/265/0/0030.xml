I desire to bring to the notice of my colleagues a        matter as regards the Coronation arrangements which has        already attracted a good deal of public interest.   It  is        that of the accommodation which can be provided to view        the Procession on that part of the Route over which the        Government has control.   I need hardly say that the        demand for seats both from overseas visitors and from        the population of this country is likely to be far in excess        of the demand which was made on the occasion of the last        Coronation.   I am afraid it is quite clear that there  is no        possibility of meeting more than a fraction of the probable        demand, either on the part of the Route which is within the        Government&apos;s jurisdiction or elsewhere, in spite of the fact        that His Majesty has agreed to a Route considerably longer        than that of previous occasions.             This matter was considered by the Coronation Committee        of the Privy Council at their meeting this morning, and        certain decisions were reached of which I think it important        that the Cabinet should be informed as soon as possible.             The first question which arose was whether stands        should be erected on the west as well as on the east side        of the East Carriage Drive in Hyde Park from Marble Arch        to Hyde Park Corner.   This matter has received the        careful consideration of the First Commissioner of Works        and of the Commissioner for Metropolitan Police,  as well as        of the Coronation Executive Committee,  and in the light of                       &apos; \       -1-      &apos;  -&quot; &quot; &apos;       -       &apos;
 their views, the Coronation COiOmittee of the Privy Council has coiiie to the conclusion that the balance of advantage is against erecting stands on the west side of the Carriage Drive.   The Committee was informed that from the police point of view it was on the whole more advantageous that the stands should not be erected;  the Committee also thought it likely that there would be considerable disappointment on the part of the general public if both sio.es of the Carriage Drive were occupied by stands, to the detriment of standing- room 0     The number of seats and chairs under the Government&apos;s control which can be proviued is in these circumstances in rounci figures 85,000.   So far as the general public demand is concerned this number is only a drop in the ocean.  Having regard to this, the Coronation Coumiittee considers that it woula be practically useless to allot any part of them to Ticket Agencies or Travel Associations for indiscriminate sale to the general public at competitive prices.   Such a sale of seats would do little, if anything, to stop high pricesbeing charged for seats on private property.   The Committee                                                  should considers? therefore, that no part of these seats/be so allotteda     The Coronation Committee has also come to the conclusion that no attempt should be made to erect special stands for sale oi seat s at high figures for the benefit of hospitals or other charities.    They have, however, approved the proposal that the normal charge for seats within the Government&apos;s jurisdiction should be fixed at a price which will cover not only the cost of the erection of the seats but also provide a margin of profit to allow a sum being distributed to one or more charitiesby the Government.   The Coronation Executive Committee has been requested by the Coronation Coiimittee to consider and aavise furthex  as to the charity or charities to which su.is might thus be allocated.   It is intended that all tickets on Government stands should be. issued subject to the condition that they arenot to be resold.

     The Coronation Committee  proposes to adopt  a scheme of allocation for the above-mentioned total  of about 85,000  seats which, after providing for a number  of official categories end for visitors from the Dominions,  India, and the Colonies, will allow in addition of a substantial allot- ment for national services and other activities  other than those directly under the State.   This arrangement will allow for seats being provided at a  reasonable cost to a large number  of persons who might otherwise be unable  to view the Coronation Procession.   The main principle  would, however,be to provide seats for representatives of as many aspossible of the nation&apos;s rctivities including Local Gevern- ment, Commerce, the Professions, Learning,Sciences, Art andLabour,,                                                      r     I  attach in an Appendix a table showing a provisional allocation of the 85,000 seats, which was submitted to the coronation Committee by the Coronation Executive Committee. It will be seen that 32,700 seats have been  allocated tovisitors from the Dominions, Colonies and India, and thatout of  the unallocated number  it will be necessary to make provision for the Home Civil Service and the representativeactivities other than those directly under the State.Following this table,  there is a list giving examples of suchrepresentative bodies and interests to which it is thoughtthat seats should be allocated.  The Coronation Committeehas given general approval to the proposals  outlined in theAppendix, on the condition that the allocation to Trade.1Unions,  Friendly Societies and other categories represent-ative of manual labour should number some 10,000 seats.These 10,000 seats would be additional to the allotmentof about 10,000 places to organised labour,   etc. in the space reserved for standing room, as set out at the endof the Appendix.                    -3-
     I would summarise as follows,  for the information ofmy colleagues, the conclusions of the Coronation Committeeof the Privy Council on this matter.1.   Stands should not he erected on the west side of     the East Carriage Drive in Hyde Park;2.   Seats on Government property should not he provided     for indiscriminate sale to the general public,  hut     should he allotted in accordance with a plan prepared     in advance.3.   The price of seats on Government property should, in     general, be cost price together with a sufficient     margin of profit to allow of a sum being distributed     to a charity or charities.4.   The allocation of seats should be in general accord-     ance with the scheme outlined in the Appendix to this     paper, on the understanding that the provision for     Trade Unions, Friendly Societies, etc , should be     about 10,000.
