Printed for the  Cabinet.  November 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 295 (36).CABINET.GIBRALTAR  AS A LINK  IN  IMPERIAL  AIR  COMMUNICATIONS.               THE PROBLEM OF  ESTABLISHING AN AIR BASE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    THE provision of an air base at Gibraltar is considered by the Committeeof Imperial Defence to be an essential need for Imperial defence.  This needwill be most acutely felt when the Royal Air Force is fully equipped with aircraft of sufficient range  to undertake the  direct flight from  England  to Gibraltar,which will be within the next two years.   It is therefore important that thereshould be  as little delay as possible in  undertaking the construction  of  the aerodrome.    2.   The only practical means  of providing an air base  at  Gibraltar is toreclaim from the sea a piece of land adjacent to the &quot; British neutral ground,&quot;north of the Rock.   Inasmuch as it would be open to the Spanish Government, inthe event of their desiring to challenge the legality of  such action, to bring thematter before the Permanent Court of International Justice under the  optional clause, the legal status of  this area and the  question  how far we should beentitled by international law  to  make  the proposed reclamation  have been carefully gone into by the Law Officers, whose  opinion has  been circulated tothe Cabinet.  In their opinion it is not possible  to say for certain whether weshould be able successfully to defend,  before an international  tribunal, our rightto take the  action  proposed.   The  Law  Officers consider that  the BritishGovernment have a prima facie case entitling them to take whatever initial stepsthey  consider appropriate pending objection by the Spanish Government, but intheir view  it would be premature  and of little value to attempt to  express  an opinion as to chances of success  until the nature and basis  of the SpanishGovernments objections, if any, have been disclosed.    3.  This matter was carefully considered in the Foreign Office before  theoutbreak of the present civil war in Spain.   It was felt then and this view wasshared by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Madrid that any attempt to pursue thescheme without consulting the Spanish Government would certainly be resisted by them, since they  are constantly on the look out for any infringement of whatthey  consider to be their  rights in the neutral ground.  It  was  felt  that HisMajesty&apos;s  Government would almost certainly  be called before an international tribunal to justify their action.    On the other hand, it was also felt that no Spanish Government would be in aposition, if approached, to give their consent to a conspicuous extension of Britishjurisdiction in Gibraltar, except in return for very considerable inducement.   Amoney compensation would probably not be adequate, because with the Spaniardsthe question would be largely one of national prestige.   The Spanish people havenever reconciled themselves to the British occupation of Gibraltar, which they regard as an anomalous limitation  of  their national territory, and  are extremelysensitive on all matters relating to its  use.      8882  [14079]
    4.  In view of the difficulty of finding a suitable quid pro quo it might, there-fore, have been considered preferable in normal circumstances to proceed with thescheme without consulting the Spanish Government and to. rely  on being able  towin  the case before the Permanent Court of International Justice.   It is forconsideration whether the recent opinion of  the Law Officers would, in normal circumstances, have justified this course.     5.  However this may be, the civil war in  Spain has greatly altered theposition, and I consider  that no moment could be more unfortunate than thepresent for embarking on this project.  An attempt to carry it out  independentlywould inevitably incur the deepest suspicion  in Spaniards of all parties that weare taking advantage of their troubles to strengthen our position  at their expense,and would implant in the minds of any future Spanish Government the greatestmistrust of our actions  and intentions.   Nor is there any chance at the presentmoment of reaching an  understanding with the Spanish  authorities on a matterof this importance.     6.  Moreover, it must be regarded as certain  that the Spanish Government(and in particular a Fascist or National Government) would be supported by theItalian  Government, and possibly other  Governments also, in their opposition tothe scheme.  The construction of a large strategic  aerodrome at  Gibraltar wouldbe of direct concern to the Italian Government, and though it might not in normal circumstances be  necessary to consider their  feelings on the subject,  it must  beremembered that we have very recently extracted from them  assurances in regardto the maintenance of the status quo in the Western Mediterranean, and that agreat development  of  the strategic importance  of Gibraltar might well  beconstrued as a deliberate attempt to alter the  status quo on our  side. It must alsobe realised that an extension of the facilities enjoyed by His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment at Gibraltar  might provide the Italians with an  excuse  for obtaining a concession or lease of  territory  for similar  purposes  elsewhere  in Spanishterritory,  at a time when they are particularly well placed for pressing  such a claim.  Another point of  importance is that it would be awkward  for us to haveto face, under  Italo-Spanish pressure, an examination  of our anchorage rights in the harbour of Gibraltar.     7.  In these  circumstances 1 feel bound  to recommend that  the initiation ofthis  scheme be suspended at  least until the issue  of the civil  war is more  clearthan it is at the  present  and until the international situation generally is  morefavourable.  There will then remain two methods of proceeding with this scheme.Either we can attempt  to obtain Spanish permission, or  we can proceed without such permission.  If we choose the first alternative, it will be necessary to examinewhat tangible inducements we can offer to the new Spanish Government to give their consent.  The question of early recognition and  of general political andfinancial support to the Insurgent Government, if it should succeed in maintainingitself as a result  of the civil  war, have a bearing on this question.  If we prefer the second alternative,  it would seem desirable that the work  should be begunquietly at a time when  general attention is less concentrated upon Spain than itis at present.
