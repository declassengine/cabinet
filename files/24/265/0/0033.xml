JThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s      Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.     I have to seek the approval of ray colleagues to theintroduction, as a somewhat urgent matter, of a very short and entirely formal Bill to clarify a point in theGovernment of India x^ct passed last year.  If the Billis to be promoted at all it is important that it shouldbe passed before 1st April next, when most of the Actwill come into operation.     The point at issue is the meaning of the words insection 292 of the Act &quot;all the law in force in british india immediately before the commencement of Part III ofthis Act&apos;!-.  The general object of the section in which those words occur was to preserve intact the IndianStatute Book notwithstanding the repeal of the existing government of India Kct.  The point which has been raisedis whether the words in question cover without doubt Actswhich contain provisions giving power to the Executive tobring them into force piecemeal or in particular areas, incases where that power has not been, or has only partiallybeen, utilised.  There are on the Indian Statute Book anumber of such Acts,  but the question is of particularGovernment.SECRET.CP.313 (36)CABINET.BILL TO AMEND SECTION 292 OF THE GQVEPNI^NT             OF INDIA ACT, 1955.
importance in the case of certain Acts of  the  BengalLegislature of this character providing powers to  dealwith terrorist activities.   The Bengal Government  havenaturally represented most strongly that if  there  is  the slightest doubt as to the preservation of  these Acts  andif consequently there is any risk of their validity,  orthe validity of any action taken under them, being called in question after 1st April in the  Indian Courts,the risk is one which they cannot afford to  run.     I referred the matter to the Law Officers who,while themselves entirely satisfied that such  Acts are,in fact, covered by the section, cannot deny that asuperficial argument to the contrary is sustainable,  and themselves are of opinion that the matter can  only beplaced beyond doubt by fresh legislation.     I propose, therefore, if my colleagues agree, tosubmit to the Home affairs Committee the text  of a short bill which, I am informed, can be obtained in  at mostthree clauses: the first operative clause would clear upthe doubt, and another clause would apply the  provisionsof the Bill to the identical difficulty which  arises onthe Burma -act.  I propose that the Bill should not onlycover the point which I have mentioned, but should alsoremove three other small points of doubt which have arisen on the construction of the section and  thefollowing section, 293, the provisions of which are closely connected, namely:-      (1) whether, in the case of Indian ^cts  which have            extra-territorial effect as well as effect            in British India, that extra-territorial            effect is, in fact, preserved (as  is necessary            and was intended) by the words &quot;law in force            in British India&quot;.&apos;
            (2) Whether the effect of the section is to                  continue in force Acts which were expressed                  as being temporary in character and as                  terminating on a fixed date - which, of                  course, was not intended.            (3) Whether the power to adapt existing Indian                  Acts given by section 293 includes (as is                  desirable that it should) the power to                  repeal any Act, or any part of an Act, the                  provisions of which are repugnant to the                  Government of India Act.         The Bill could, if necessary, of course, be    introduced in the House of Lords.  But I suggest that the    more convenient course might be to take it first in the    House of Commons, and to place it on the Order Paper in    that House for all its stages along with the East India    Loans Bill.         I do not anticipate that the Bill should give rise    to any controversy or difficulty, since its sole purpose    will be to make clearer what was the undoubted intention    of Parliament in enacting sections 292 and 293 of the Act.
