(C.I.D. Paper No. 1269-B.)     (Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 282nd Meeting, Minute 5.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1269-B) regarding the position of Belgium inthe proposed Five-Power Conference.    SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD, at the request of the Chairman, introduced theReport and summarised the salient points, leading to the conclusion that from themilitary point of view His Majesty&apos;s Government should not ask that in the new treaty Belgium should guarantee the United Kingdom,  and  should not supportthe view of the French Government  that Belgium should guarantee France (andGermany).  This conclusion was in accord with the conclusion reached in a reportdated September  1936,  dealing  with the preparations for  the  Five-power conference^    SIR ROBERT VANSITTART said that he had no reason  to differ with theconclusion reached by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.   Any opposition on  our part to the policy recently declared by  the Belgian Government might encourage the Belgians to pursue a less vigorous defence policy than  now  seemed possible.                              CONCLUSIONS.    THE  COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed           To recommend     (a) That  approval  should be given to the  Report  by the Chiefs of Staff          Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1269-B), the conclusions of which          are summarised in paragraph 15 as follows :           &quot; (i)  From the  military  point  of view, His  Majesty&apos;s Government                 should  not  ask that in  the new Treaty  Belgium  should                 guarantee the United Kingdom; and           (ii)  From the  military  point  of view, His  Majesty&apos;s Government                 should not support the view of the French  Government that                 in the  new  Treaty Belgium should  guarantee France (and                 Germany).&quot;    (b) That the Report should  be submitted to the Cabinet together with  the          Minutes of the Committee on the subject.        ******   2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,         October 29, 1936.                          * C.I.D.

(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1260-B.)                               REPORT.Introductory.    IN our Report on the preparations  for  the Five-Power Conference, theconclusions that we recorded on the question as to whether         &apos;&apos; Belgium should be relieved of giving any guarantee, and her commit-    ments limited to an understanding to defend her own territory,&quot;were as follows* :    &quot; (i)  An effective Belgian neutrality would be greatly to our advantage and         should  not deliberately  be  rendered impossible,  even though the         chances of its being maintained throughout a  Western European war         are remote.    (ii) We should, therefore, welcome a request by Belgium that she should not         be  a guarantor Power, but should  merely give an  undertaking to         defend her own territory.&quot;    2.  Since then, Belgium has made  a public declaration of her policy.  Forthe future she is determined to ensure  the protection of her own  frontiers, but she intends to have no  obligations  as a guarantor  Power.  In  other words,Belgium has adopted the precise attitude which -we hoped, from the military point of view, that she would adopt.    3.  We have been informed by the Foreign Office that the French government feel strongly on the subject of this declaration of Belgian policy, and  that theirAmbassador has indeed expressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would support the French Government in urging the Belgian Government to remain aguarantor State.    4.  We have, therefore, been requested (see Appendix) to  re-examine theconclusions summarised in paragraph 1 above, in the light of the arguments adducedby the Belgians and France, in the notes which are annexed to the Appendix tothis Report.  (Enclosures Nos. 1 and 2 respectively.)               * Enclosure to C.I.D. Paper No. 1260-B, paragraph 45.      [13990]                                                    B
Belgian A rguments.     5.  It  would  appear  that  Belgium  has  two principal reasons  for  herunwillingness to be a guarantor Power.   In the first place, she desires to avoid the risk of being drawn into war as a result of French commitments in central and Eastern Europe, and particularly as a result of the Franco-Soviet Pact.  Withthis desire we have every sympathy, the more so since  we recently emphasised in our Report on the preparations for the Five-Power Conference, the importance,from our own point of view, of taking &quot;steps to ensure that any guarantee wegive will not automatically draw us into a war which has as its origin the rectifi-cation of Germany&apos;s Eastern frontier.&quot;  (Enclosure to C.I.D. Paper No. 1260-B,paragraph 48.)  In the same Report* we stressed the necessity, from the military point of view, for limiting our commitments in Europe,  and for undertaking noliability to engage in any war in which our vital interests  are not affected.  It maybe  that in  any case Belgium&apos;s chance  of  maintaining an effective  neutralitythroughout a Western war  is small; but in our opinion the chance will be verymuch greater if she is relieved of  any guarantees and if her only commitment isan understanding  to defend her own territory.     Moreover, the greater her chance of maintaining her  neutrality effectively theless is the likelihood of our being  dragged in; consequently  we ought to supporther in gaining this end by relieving her of any guarantees.     6.  Secondly,  it seems that the Belgian Government desire to promote national unity in support of a national foreign policy, and thereby, to obtain the support ofthe Belgian people for the  strengthening of their military forces and defences.As to this,  it is clear that  any action which renders Belgium the more able todefend her  own territory, is to our advantage from the military point of view.If, therefore, the giving of  a guarantee to France would, as we believe to be thecase, wreck the hope of Belgian national unity  in the field of foreign policy, and thereby prejudice the military preparations which, we learn, are being undertaken by  the Belgian Government  with commendable vigour in the face  of strongParliamentary opposition, it would be unwise on our part to use our influence insupport of the French demand for any such guarantee.French Arguments.     7.  Turning now to the French objections to the  declared  policy  of  theBelgian Government (see Enclosure No. 2 to Appendix), they draw attention inthe first place to its implications from the Belgian point of view.  They argue thatthe close collaboration  in the preparation of concerted  defence plans that  hashitherto existed between the French and Belgian General Staffs will no longer bepossible.   As a  result,  there will  be inevitable delay in the assistance -that  canbe given by the French Army, and a risk that Belgium may be overrun before such assistance can become effective.     8.  There is, of course, some force in this argument.  We would observe, how-ever, that we have  been informed by the Chief of the Imperial General  Staff thatGeneral Gamelin,  the Chief of the French General Staff, informed our military attache in Paris,  as  recently as  last March, that the French were prepared tosupport Belgium,  only if it was known for certain that  the British Field force was on its way to  Belgium.  It seems probable that this  threat to leave belgium to her fate was intended to  force us into a definite commitment to send the field force to Belgium at the outset of the war, and to undertake, in time of peace, the detailed military  conversations that this commitment would  involve.   In thesecircumstances we are left with the strong impression that what the  French mostfear from the Belgian  declaration although they do not  admit it is that thetermination of the existing close liaison between the French and Belgian General Staffs  will automatically put  an end to any hope of the  Franco-British military conversations.     9.  As to this, it is our  opinion that mutual assistance pacts on a multi-lateral basis have no more military value than the Covenant of the League.  Anymultilateral  agreement,  as wTe have  previously  pointed out,t  precludes  thepossibility  of effective staff  conversations between the parties  thereto,  since it is              * Enclosure to  C.I.D. Paper No. 1260-B, paragraphs 4 and 5.              f Enclosure to O.I.D. Paper No. 1260-B, paragraphs 59 to 62.
 ciearly impracticable to concert plans with A for war against B and, at the same time, with B for war against A.  We have also expressed the view* that bilateral staff conversations or conversations between a limited number of the parties to a multilateral agreement would be invidious, and would, moreover,  tend  to involve us in military commitments which would fetter our freedom of action as to the form that our intervention might take when the occasion arose.   Therefore, we again wish to emphasise that, whatever the position of Belgium in  any new treaty that may be negotiated, other of course than a definite alliance, we should not be committed to military  conversations, either with France or with Belgium.   It might be thought right to make a definite statement to this effect to the French Government.     10.   Turning  again to the French  objections, they argue that the recent Belgium declaration involves grave consequences to French and British interests. In the first place, the concentration of the French and British forces would, they consider,  be prejudiced by the fact that,  in the absence of a pre-concerted plan, the distant Franco-Belgian cover, which is at present contemplated, would not be available in time.  This argument assumes, without justification, that we  are committed to despatching the Field Force  to France at the outset of hostilities.     11.   Apart from this, the French contend that the most  serious consequences of Belgian neutrality would arise in connection with aerial warfare (see Annex to Enclosure No. 2, Section II).  They point  out, in particular, that both France and Great Britain  would, under the new Belgian policy, be deprived  of the Belgian anti-aircraft observation service and anti-aircraft  defences, and  of the use  of Belgian  aerodromes.  Great Britain would thus &quot;find  it impossible to  operate on the vital zone of the Ruhr, and the German bases in  Westphalia,&quot; whilst  the French air forces would be unable, without inevitable difficulties, to reach these objectives, for to  do  so they would have to make  long nights  over German territory. Germany, on the other hand, would be able to attack London from bases on the North Sea, whereas &quot;Great Britain would have no chance of attacking, by way of reprisal, German  objectives of comparable importance.     12.   It is our view that recent technical developments have reduced the potential value to us of the Belgian observation service and anti-aircraft defences, and it is an over-statement to suggest that it would be impossible for us to operate against the Ruhr without the use of Belgian aerodromes.  We could clearly do so by operating from bases in N.E. France,  and the tactical difficulties in doing  so would be largely offset by the greater certainty of occupying  them  and the added security  and convenience of  such bases  and  their lines  of communication as compared to those  in  Belgium.   Though we  agree generally with the  French thesis that a neutral Belgium would enable  German Air Forces to attack  our vital areas in  greater strength than we could attack theirs,  it must be observed that even if Belgium were not neutral, the Germans would still have the advantage due  to  the far  greater  importance  and  vulnerability of  London than any comparable objective in  Germany.    13.  We have, however, seen a Recordt of a conversation  between Mr. Strang and  M. Massigli in which the  latter &quot;admitted that there might be ways of getting round these difficulties, even if Belgium gave no  express guarantee.  She might,  for example, consent to the passage of French or British forces, through or over her territory, in circumstances to be defined in the new treaty, and indeed, she was bound to do so  under Article XVI (3), of the Covenant, if France and Great Britain were acting under that article.&quot;  The possibilities of  the caseclearly call for the  most careful examination.                                CONCLUSION.    14.   The foregoing examination of the arguments adduced by the Belgiansand French has led us to the conclusion that, from the military point of view, thebalance of  advantage is  to be derived from adhering  to the  recommendationsquoted in paragraph 1 above.             * Enclosure to C.I.D.

    15.  Accordingly,  our  answers  to the specific questions put  to us by theForeign Office, are as follows :      (i) From the military  point of view, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not          ask that in the new  Treaty  Belgium should guarantee the United          Kingdom;  and    (ii) From the military  point of view, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not          support the view of the French Government  that in the new Treaty          Belgium should  guarantee France (and Germany).

APPENDIX. [C.O.S. 515.]                     -- Copy of a letter from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial                                  Defence. [C 6903/4/18] Sir,                                       Foreign Office, October 16,  1936.     IT will be recalled that in Foreign Office memorandum* of the 19th  August on the preparations for the proposed Five Power  Conference the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence was sought on the question whether Belgium should be relieved of giving any guarantee and her commitments limited to an undertaking  to defend her own territory.   The  views  of the Committee of Imperial Defence on this question will be  found  in  paragraphs 36-45 of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee&apos;s Report! of the 1st September (CP. 218 (36)). The conclusions of the Sub-Committee were that:      (1) an effective  Belgian neutrality would be greatly to our  advantage  and          should not deliberately be rendered impossible even though the  chances          of its being maintained  throughout a  Western European war are          remote, and     (2) we should, therefore,  welcome a request by  Belgium that she  should          not be a guarantor Power but should merely give an undertaking to          defend her own territory.    2.  Subsequently, on the 17th September, a  memorandum was communicated to the four other Governments, in paragraph 5  (1) of which is expressed, in the following words, the view of  His Majesty&apos;s Government as to  which  Powers should give and receive guarantees so far as the United Kingdom is concerned :          &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to guarantee the observance    of such (non-aggression) arrangements as between  Germany on the one hand    and France and Belgium on the other, in return for similar  guarantees for    the United Kingdom from  France against Germany  and from  Germany    against  France.&quot; It should be noted that in this memorandum no view is expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government upon the question of a Belgian guarantee to France, or,  indeed, respecting guarantees by or to any Power except in cases where His Majesty&apos;s Government  are themselves directly interested.    3.   During the recent discussions at Geneva it was learned that the  French Government   intended  to  emphasise the importance which, for a number  of reasons, they  attached to a Belgian guarantee to  France. It was also learned (see Geneva despatch:): No. 96 of the 30th September; copy enclosed) that the Belgian Government  were very satisfied with our Note  of  the  17th September did  not propose a Belgian guarantee to the United Kingdom and that they hoped that France also would not ask Belgium for a guarantee.  Subsequently, the  French Governments views were developed in detail in a memorandum^ communicated by the French Delegation at Geneva on the 2nd October (Geneva despatch No.  106 of the 2nd October; copy enclosed).   Copy of recordsll of conversations at Geneva between French and  Belgian Ministers and officials, which have been communi- cated confidentially by the French Embassy in London, are also enclosed.    4.   The arguments used by the  French  and Belgian Governments for and against Belgium  continuing as a guarantor Power are not discussed  in  the Foreign Office memorandum of the 19th August, nor in the Chiefs of  Staffsmemorandum of the 1st September.  I am therefore directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to ask that the views of the Committee of Imperial Defence may be obtained with the least possible delay on such of these arguments as have a military character.  * Appendix to Enclosure to C.I.D.

    5.  There are, in effect, two separate questions  now under discussion :     (a)  Should His Majesty&apos;s Government ask that  in the new Treaty Belgium          should guarantee the United Kingdom, although this was not the case          under the Locarno Treaty ?    (b)  Should His  Majesty&apos;s  Government support the  view of the French          Government that in  the  new Treaty, as  in  the Treaty of Locarno,          Belgium should guarantee France (and Germany) ?    6.  Mr. Eden will  be glad if the Committee  of Imperial  Defence willreconsider both these questions in relation to one another as well as in the lightof the  technical  arguments now adduced by  both the  French  and belgian governments.  I am  to point out that an early decision may be required of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, as  the French Ambassador asked on the 13th October tobe furnished with their views  as  soon as  possible.  The  French Governmentevidently feel  strongly on  this subject, and the Ambassador,  indeed, expressedthe hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would support the French Governmentin urging the Belgian Government to remain a guarantor  State.    7.  Since  the foregoing was written the  need for very early  considerationhas been emphasised by the speech of the King of the Belgians on the 14th October.

United Kingdom Delegation,          Geneva, September 30, 1936.                         Annex to Enclosure No. 1.          Record of a Conversation between Mr. Eden and M. Spaak.    I HAD a conversation this evening with M. Spaak, the Belgian ForeignMinister,  who asked me  whether I could give him any information as to thepresent position and prospects of the Five-Power meeting.  He had heard somepessimistic reports which his own information did not seem to justify, and this had made him particularly anxious to obtain authentic information.   I  gaveM. Spaak some account of recent developments, which, I said, led me to agreewith him  that, while there were still plenty  of obstacles to be overcome, there seemed to me to be no grounds for excessive pessimism at present.    M. Spaak said that he had carefully studied the memorandum which we had sent to him stating our views  as to the method we proposed for facilitating theprogress of negotiations through the diplomatic channel.  The Belgian Govern-ment were in entire agreement with those suggestions.  They were, however,  by no means so completely  in agreement with the  document submitted by the FrenchGovernment, and  M. Spaak asked me whether I intended to return any reply tothis.  I said that  I had not yet had time to give any detailed study to the Frenchdocument, and that I did not expect to be able to do  this until I arrived back inLondon.   I would then consider whether the  document was of a  character thatcalled for a reply.  My own impression was  that the French Government had stated  that it was for our information, and I supposed for that of the BelgianGovernment also,  but that it had not been communicated  to the other signatories of the Locarno Treaty.  M. Spaak said that this was so.  In the circumstances, I
added, the document was hardly in the same category as our memorandum, whichhad been submitted to all the signatories with a view to furthering progress, andit would perhaps be a pity if in this early stage of our diplomatic negotiationsthere  were  already  two sets  of proposals in  existence.  With this opinionM. Spaak declared himself to be in complete agreement.    The Belgian Foreign  Minister then asked  me  whether I had had anyconversation with the Dutch Government as to  their participation in a newWestern Pact.  I replied that I had not, whereupon M. Spaak said that he had had some exchange of views with the Dutch Minister at Brussels, which had been followed up by some conversation with M. de Graeff himself at Geneva within thelast few days.   From this it appeared that the position of Holland was that shewas willing to be guaranteed, but that she did not wish to be a signatory of the projected treaty.  M. Spaak commented that this seemed to him to be hardly atenable position, and he thought it likely that in due course the Dutch would move from it and be willing to sign a treaty by which their territory was guaranteed aslong as they were not asked to guarantee others.    In this connexion the Belgian Foreign Minister expressed his gratitude thatin our proposals we had not suggested  that Belgium should guarantee GreatBritain.  As  he understood our  position, we did not ask Belgium  for such aguarantee,  but we did expect her to  insist upon respect of her neutrality, both byland and by air.  I replied that this was the position.   M. Spaak expressed the earnest hope that it might be the  position of the French Government  also, for ifBelgium had further to increase her armaments and her length of military service,both of which he feared would be necessary in the near  future, it would be greatly facilitated  if she were not asked to guarantee France.  It was impossible to denythat,  unfortunately,  there  was a certain anti-French feeling in Belgium.   Agraceful gesture by France, such as we had made in our proposals, while it could have  no deep  political significance,  would  be of the  greatest assistance  in promoting Belgian national unity in support of a national foreign policy; it wouldbe all the better if Belgium and Holland could  eventually be in the pact on thesame  terms.    I understood from M. Spaak that he had made some progress with the FrenchGovernment in conversation on this subject, though the latter appeared to have certain apprehensions as to the consequences of Belgium not guaranteeing France.He himself thought  these apprehensions misplaced, since France stood to gainif she  only were attacked by Germany, for her own narrow frontier was heavilydefended.    I  asked M. Spaak what was his view as to the problem of Luxemburg whichhad been raised in the French memorandum.  He replied that he did not considerthat the matter had  any political  significance.  Luxemburg&apos;s position wasunchanged in this respect by the violation of the demilitarised zone.  The question was purely a military one and should be considered on that basis.    Finally, the Belgian Foreign Minister stated that he had the impression, fromconversations which he  had had with certain members of the French delegation in the last few days, that relations between France and Soviet Russia  were now alittle less close than they had been a month or two ago.   This fact seemed to giveM. Spaak some satisfaction, even  though he is a Socialist.                                                      ANTHONY EDEN.

Consequences from the Military Point of  View of a  change in the International     Situation of Belgium as established by the Treaty of Locarno. (Communi-     cated by M. Delbos to the Secretary of State.)     A modification of the international situation of Belgium tending to divest her of every obligation as a guarantor Power and  leaving her merely  in  the position of one guaranteed might  have serious consequences, both from the point of view of Belgian security and from the  point of view of French and British interests.                                      I.     So long as Belgium intends herself to ensure the protection of her frontiers, such a modification would not  result for  her in any reduction  of her military burdens.     Franco-Belgian military collaboration, in the event of a conflict, in effect only implies  assistance  to  be rendered by  the  French armies  to a  Belgium whose territory has been violated or has  been threatened with violation; by abandoning her position as guarantor Power  in respect of France, Belgium would thus not be avoiding any positive obligation.     On the other hand, it is permissible to ask whether, once the international situation of Belgium has been modified, French assistance  would have the same efficacity.     At present this assistance takes the form of intervention, after a very short lapse of time, by the first echelon of important forces.     The despatch of  these forces  after this short lapse of time presupposes a careful preparation in time of peace on the part of the General Staffs of the two armies working in collaboration;  and it necessitates  close and frequent contacts between these General Staffs.     As soon as the co-operation of the two armies no longer takes place as the consequence of  reciprocal obligations between the two countries, two forces will operate to relax the military ties which exist between Paris and Brussels;  on the one  hand,  the  same  Belgian elements which  would  favour the abandonment by Belgium of the position of guarantor would declare for a strict application of the principle of  neutrality;  on the other hand, Germany would not  fail, proceeding from the modification which had taken place in the situation of Belgium in relation to France,  to  argue  that the guarantee given without reciprocity by all the signatories of the  new treaty to Belgium implies a loosening of the military ties with France.   It  is impossible not to recall in  this respect the  advantage which German  a,pologetics have drawn from the supposed Anglo-Belgian Staff conversations which preceded 1914.     Thus the preparation in time of peace of the Franco-Belgian co-operation mentioned  above  would  become  impossible;  from   which  the  following consequences would  result, which would not fail to have  a serious import for Belgium :      An inevitable delay in  the assistance given by  the French armies  to the Belgian armies fighting for the defence of the national frontiers;     A risk that the Belgian forces would  find themselves unable to hold up the German forces on the Meuse;     The Belgian forces  would be obliged  to abandon to the enemy the greater part of the territory,  with all the consequences  which might result so far as concerns the subsequent conduct of operations.     Such risks would  not, moreover, be compensated  for by any  chance that the reich, on account of the attitude of strict neutrality  adopted by  Belgium, might at the  beginning  of  a  conflict renounce  the invasion  of that  country.  the invasion of Belgian territory by Germany in  the event of military operations in western Europe results in effect  as much  from strategical necessities as from political aims;  every  diminution  of the possibility  of defending the country would, by increasing the advantages to be  gained from such an invasion,  in theend only encourage the German General Staff still more to  undertake  it.
     Such, generally speaking, from the Belgian point of view, are the military consequences to be foreseen, whether  it is  a case of war  on land or of war in the air.     If the situation be now considered from the point of view of French and British interests, the consequences appear singularly grave.     It will be noted first that, should a German offensive in Belgian territory be facilitated for  the reasons indicated above, the concentration of the French and British forces, deprived as they would  be  of the distant  Franco-Belgian  cover which it would not have been possible to organise in time, might be hindered.  But it is, above all, from the point of view of aerial warfare  that the consequences would be serious.     Here there are several hypotheses to examine :      (a) The  case of  a German attack confined to the Franco-German frontier             and not including flight  over Belgium.     Under the Treaty of Locarno, France and England were  entitled  to demand from Belgium  the bringing into action of the  Belgian observation service and anti-aircraft system, the right of flight over Belgium (which would result, in any case, from the application of article 16 of the Covenant of the  League of Nations) and the right to use  Belgian aerodromes.  That being  so, the French and British air forces would be able, without difficulty and effectively,  to attack the  Ruhr Basin.  Moreover,  the Belgian observation service would allow  enemy  forces making for Paris or London to be observed  within a limit of time  compatible with the  necessary  delay in  putting  into  operation  the arrangements for the defence of the  two capitals.     On the other hand, in the event of Belgium confining herself to the attitude of a  &quot;guaranteed Power,&quot; Great Britain would find it  impossible  to operate on the vital zone of the Ruhr, and on the  German  air bases in Westphalia; it would follow from this that the assistance of the British air forces would lose a great deal of its effect so far as  France is concerned.  As  for the  French air forces,  they  would  be unable, without  inevitable  difficulties,  to reach  these objectives, for  to  do so they would have to make  a long flight  over German territory.     It will be observed, on the other hand,  that Germany, operating from  bases on the North Sea, would be able, without violating Belgian air, to attack London. In this case Great Britain would have no chance of attacking, by way of reprisals, German objectives of comparable importance.     (b) The case of a German  land attack confined to the Franco-German frontier             with violation. of Belgian  air, but without acts of  war  being             committed on Belgian territory.     If the Belgian Government does not consider flight over its territory to be a casus belli, the situation will be,  from the French  and English point of  view, extremely serious.  Certainly,  French and British air forces will be able in  their turn to fly over Belgian territory to attack the Ruhr and the German air bases in Westphalia; but France and Great Britain will lose the advantage of the Belgian observation service, which will be very serious for  the security of Paris and still more for that of London.     (c)  The case of  the German attack violating the  territory and  the air of             Belgium.     Evidently in this case there is no  theoretical difference between Belgium as a guarantor  and  as  a guaranteed Power.  But if,  in consequence of the new situation of Belgium, no preparations for intervention had been made  in time of peace, the efficacy and, above all, the rapidity of the intervention of the Franco- British air forces would be seriously diminished.  The absence of previous agree- ment for the  organisation of the observation service  in Belgian territory for the advantage of France and England would,  moreover,  have extremely awkward consequences, at least at the outset of the conflict.                                    III.    To sum up, the  modification of the situation  of Belgium in the new treaty would  offer grave drawbacks  from the point of  view of French and Britishinterests.
    As for Belgium herself, since the French and British obligations towards a guaranteed Power are identically the same as towards a guarantor Power, this modification would be without practical inconvenience,  if preparation could bemade in time of peace for the co-operation of the three countries.  But, for thereasons  indicated above, the most serious  doubts must be expressed in this connexion.  If these doubts are  even in part well founded, the consequences forBelgian security would be grave; in view of the conditions of modern war, havingregard at once to the possibility of  a German attack by rapid motorised forces and to the technical conditions of French intervention,  a minute and continuouspreparation for co-operation is  particularly necessary.   In  the absence of suchpreparation, the French army would only be able, at the best, to form a rallying-point for the Belgian army.    Geneva, October 2, 1936.
