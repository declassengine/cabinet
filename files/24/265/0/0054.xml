CABINET.THE ROLE OF  THE  BRITISH  ARMY.              Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    IN his memorandum of the 3rd  December (OP. 326 (36))  the Secretary ofState for War raises two issues.  The first concerns the role of the  British Army,in which he asks his colleagues to &quot; reaffirm their decision.&quot;  The second concerns the time at which steps should be taken to incur expenditure on the re-equipment of the  Territorial  Army;  he suggests that  a start  should  be made now,  as opportunity offers, priority being given to the Regular Army.    These two issues  are  closely inter-related, but I wish at the outset to say something about the role of the British Army.    2.  It  is  implicit in  the  present form  of  Army  organisation  that theTerritorial Army  is to be used,  if  necessary, to  reinforce  the Regular Armyoverseas.  But in my view there is a  wide difference between this  statement andthe statements in paragraphs 6 and  9  of the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum to the effect that we must aim at being able to send  contingents of the TerritorialArmy overseas with the minimum of delay.  The D.R.C. aimed at a  schemewhereby three  contingents, each consisting of four  divisions  of Territorials,should proceed overseas at intervals of  four, six and  eight months after theoutbreak of war.  The Secretary of State for War  does not appear content  withthis, since he argues that we cannot  rely on having time, as in the last war, tobuild up and equip an Army.  It would therefore appear as though his ultimate aim was that the measure of the military effort which we should be able to make on,  or shortly  after,  the  outbreak  of war should be  not  the  First RegularContingent of five divisions, but four  contingents, comprising  in all seventeendivisions.    Acceptance  of this  Conception  could  not,  in my  view,  be regarded  asreaffirmation of a previous  decision.    3.  The Secretary of State does  not explain in detail the type of emergencywhich is likely to require a Field Force of  seventeen divisions available as soonas possible after  the  outbreak  of  war.  I should imagine, however,  from hisparallel with the last war  that he has in  mind war in Western Europe in which large continental  Armies are engaged.  In  essence it seems to me that what wehave to decide  upon is the  size and character of the force which we must plan tobe available on the outbreak of such a war, and I submit that this  decision is oneof major importance  which should  only be answered  after a  survey  by thecompetent authorities  of all possible  alternatives.    4.  If we  could afford to consider the scale of our military efforts in isolationfrom our other defence preparations, there is clearly much to be said for theSecretary of State&apos;s view.   But  it is necessary, in determining the  role which our army can be called upon to play, to  consider the parts played by the other two services, and the effect upon our industrial organisation of the present programme for remedying our defence deficiencies.       [14276]                  Printed for the Cabinet. December 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy  No. &apos;CP. 334 (36).
  ,   5.  The Navy remains the first line of defence in preserving our sea communi-cations.  For this reason we have always put the maintenance of  a strong Fleetbefore the maintenance of  a large Army, and we must continue to do so.     But a Navy, however strong, no longer suffices for the defence of this country.Unless we are to  be at the  mercy of a sudden knockout blow from a ContinentalWestern Power we must have a  strong Air  Force.  Further, such is  the powerof attack from the air that it is only by building up an Air Force capable itself of dealing a powerful attacking blow, and therefore affording a strong deterrentagainst any attack upon us, that we can ever hope to  provide a real measure of security for these  islands.     6.  The position in which we find ourselves  to-day  is that after a  period in which  we  deliberately  allowed  deficiencies  to  accumulate,  in the hope  ofsecuring a measure of international agreement on  disarmament,  this  country isat the beginning of an intensive effort to rebuild our defences.  In order, however,to secure these islands from attack, it is necessary that we should  not  merely, asin the past, make our Navy  sufficiently strong  to preserve our overseas communica-tions.  We must also build  up a strong Air Force able to strike a potential enemyat least as hard as he can hit us; and at the same time to provide the maximumpassive defence against air attack.  This latter includes the re-equipment of that part of the Territorial  Army which provides Anti-Aircraft defence.     7.  These needs have  first claim.   Looking at the matter from a practical point of view, the essential point is whether  our resources (skilled labour, indus-trial organisation, finance and  imports)  can  cope effectively  with the whole task,in addition to the equipment required for seventeen  divisions ready to take  an effective part in Continental War.     8.  In this connection it  must be  borne in mind that, if we are to  sendseventeen  divisions overseas on, or  shortly after, the outbreak of war, we must also  take into account the  effect upon the Supply  position.   We should have tomaintain in peace time, as a permanent commitment, largely increased reservestores of all kinds, and an  inweased capacity for munitions production, in orderthat the seventeen divisions might be kept continuously supplied from  soon afterthe outbreak of war.     AH this would seem likely to involve very  heavy additions to the cost andstrain of the  programme, more especially  when it is  remembered that  theproposals now under consideration for the provision of tanks, .&amp;c., for the FirstContingent of the Field Force have been found nearly twice as costly as thoseincluded in the approved programme.     9.  Work  has been in progress  for a  few months only upon the  defence programme;  but  already there are signs of shortages or impending shortages of skilled labour; already, too, there are symptoms that our exports are slackening,notwithstanding favourable trade tendencies; and it is only too clear that overseastrade once lost will not be easy to recover.   Again, within  but a few  months ofthe  Cabinet  having approved a comprehensive scheme  of rearmament which represented the results of many months of preparation, it has been found necessaryto seek authority for additions to the approved  programme, of which  the cost isin the neighbourhood of  100 millions,  while the total of Defence Estimates for1937 seems likely to exceed the forecast given to the Cabinet in February  last by 70  millions.  These figures are quoted to show that there is a continuous upwardstrain on our industrial and other resources.   ,10.  All this tends to indicate that  the execution of; the  programme approved in February which included  the re-equipment  of five Regular  Divisions  only,is as much as our resources can at present stand;  and  that to add to that programme any  substantial degree of  re-equipment of the  Territorial  force would.,, only result in the breakdown of  the whole  scheme.     11.  Even, however,  if  we were to assume that  our resources will  not be wholly occupied  in the next  two or  three years with: the  existing programme,is it certain that the  re-equipment of a Field Force consisting of, say, seventeendivisions is the best way of utilising  our available sources *of production ?  this seems to me to require very serious-consideration.
   &apos; 12.  Owing to our geographical position it is unnecessary for us to maintain a large army ready for war at a moment&apos;s notice.  It is thus open  to us, if weso chose,  to devote a correspondingly larger proportion of our available resources to the  Air Arm than is the case with Continental Powers.  The Air Arm has emerged  in recent years as a factor of first-rate, if not decisive,  importance.    Further, the rate of expenditure on munitions of war of all kinds by modernarmies in the field is so great that we should probably attain a far greater degreeof strength  by concentrating on air strength  than we could attain if  we were now to devote a considerable proportion of our energies to the re-equipment  ofa larger  military force.  Should  we not be wise  to exploit these factors to thefull, and to build up an Air Force which might  well exercise a preponderatinginfluence, rather than  to spend  our resources on equipping  in  peace time amilitary  force  which could only  be small  compared  with Continental armies&apos;?I suggest that, before  coming to any decision, we should give  due weight  tothese alternatives.    13.  The Secretary of State says in paragraph 6 of his paper that a war of any magnitude cannot be fought upon the principle of limited liability.  I am not, of course, making  any such  suggestion, though it would be no less foolishto assume that our resources  are  without limit.   The important point  is so toprepare our resources in peace as to make the most effective use of  them on theoutbreak of war; naturally bearing in mind that as the war progresses we must be free to readjust our  national effort as circumstances may require.    14.  There remains the political aspect  of  this problem.  No doubt  theexistence of  a substantial British Army strong  enough for immediate and effectiveintervention  in Continental disputes, in addition  to our  naval and air forces,would  in some respects strengthen our influence on the Continent.  But there aredefinite limits  to the contribution we can make in such an eventuality; and inmaking our  choice of the relative sizes of the three arms of our Fighting Services,we should not lose sight of the fact  that the  political temper  of people in thiscountry is strongly opposed to Continental adventures.    15.  Although when the time comes they may, as in 1914, be persuaded that intervention by us is inevitable, they will be strongly suspicious of any preparationmade in peace time with a view to large-scale military operations on the Continent,and they will regard such preparations as likely to result  in our being entangledin disputes which do not concern us.    16.  Opinions will, no doubt, differ as to.whether or not this  almost instinctiveaversion  from large-scale military preparations corresponds with a sound percep-tion  of the principles upon which our foreign policy should be founded.  Butat least it is a factor which can never be ignored by those responsible for framingour policies.     17.  I note that the Director-General of Munition Production is of opinionthat the  industrial position of the country makes it possible to make a start onthe re-equipment of the Territorial Force. But it must be remembered that thecountry  is not yet feeling the full strain of the programme already  approved, asmay be judged by the very large increase in  Defence Estimates which is likelyto be asked for next year, as compared with  the current  year.  I am  far fromconfident that  we could safely proceed to an expansion of a part of the defence programme which, in my view, stands in a lower priority to other defence needs.     18.  I am entirely in agreement with the view of the Secretary of State forWar as expressed in his last paragraph that the ultimate goal of endeavour shouldbe clearly known from the start.   But I  submit that the considerations  advanced in his paper  do not  take account of all the factors which should be appraisedbefore a final  decision is taken, and  I have  endeavoured  in  the foregoing paragraphs to set out some of them for the attention of the Cabinet.    :  :     Treasury  Chambers, &amp;.
