Amir&apos;s letter: &quot; I am sorry owing to certain causes a little delay has taken place in ray making haste to send a reply to Your Excellency&apos;s friendly letter dated 9th August 1920. I join with Your Excellency, in the friendly greetings which Your Excellency conveyed to me at the time of the return of my Royal delegation, and in the expression of Your Excellency&apos;s gratification that the real (? aim) what was removal of mutual misunderstanding and the paving of the way to conclusion of a . treaty of friendship between the two Governments, has been attained. I write to say that head of our delegation anal his companion, having returned in perfect health and with souvenirs of friendship, came to our Royal presence and submitted to us and to the Supreme Council the detailed particulars of discussions, and also a written statement which was given by the Honourable Head of the respected delegation of tlie t Illustrious Government of,Britannia to the Head of our respected delegation, the Foreign Minister, together with certain other memoranda and writings. We have fully acquainted ourselves with what was said verbally, and what was contained in (said) writings. I myself and my Council, cannot refrain from expressing our pleasure at elegant manner in which hospitality was shown and courteous reception was given by officers of British Government to our respectable (? respected) delegation; and also at the proof of sincere and good intention of the Illustrious British Government toward Afghanistan. Notwithstanding, some of the items contained in written statement and the memoranda have been found in our Supreme Council not to be free from possibility of complaint and objection. I Can assure Your Excellency that this objection and complaint does not conflict with basis of question(s) on which we wish to found conclusion of a treaty of friendship, but refers to certain things, which are considered to be trivial; and with regard, to many matters it is found that they are suitable (? and) comfortable.&quot;As the Honourable Mr. Dobbs suggested to the Head of our Royal delegation at Mussoorie, the necessity of sending of an (sic) envoy on behalf of Your Excellency&apos;s Government to our sublime court, I write to say that Afghanistan considers itself ready and prepared for conclusion of a treaty of friendship ; and in the same way as Your Excellency has said that there will he no objection on the part of Your Excellency&apos;s Government to negotiate a treaty, my Royal Government has also no objection with regard to it.&quot; Therefore, if trustworthy representatives invested with power to conclude a treaty are sent to Kabul on behalf of Your Excellences Government, so that after arriving at an understanding, conclusion of a treaty of friendship may be arranged, (sic) I hope Your Excellency will inform me of the nomination of representative and his companion and strength of party, which including officers and subordinates should &apos; not exceed 20 persons ; and also of the time, of their departure so that endeavours may be made to succeed at the earliest moment in establishing (? feeling of) amity, and in raising high the relations of friendship such as prevail among friendly and free Governments of world.&quot;  End of Part 1.   Part 2 follows.
