9 HffTH SESSION OP THE GOVERNING BODY OJ THB IIWEmTIQi^LABOUR OPfllOB.DRAB^T INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIR MALCOLM DELEVIflGHB.1.   Confirmation of the Minutes of the fourth Session. RQ^est of Norway for copies of Minutes.The British Government, on the merits of the case, have no objection to Norway or any other country being informed of the proceedings of the Governing Body.     But if the existing circulation of the Minutes is cn^reby extended, it will probafrly be impossible to resist the demands of other Govern-ments for the same privilege.   Not only the Governments but also the employers and workers1 associations in each country may then demand, with equal justice, to receive copies of the Minutes. That may lead to a demand for representation from wvy smaller States, involving^ if granted, the creation of a body so large as to convert the Governing Body into a general debating Society. It is suggested that the point raised by Norway be met by the reply that the proceedings of the Governing Body will now be reported fully in the printed Bulletin of the I*Lt3U 3t   Letter to Governing Body from Mr, Zaalberg re incident at Genoa.This letter is understood to have reference to a pilTate conversation.The matter is, therefore, a personal one and not for theGoverning Body-1-
4*   He port of thoi Director.This will presumably relate to the activities of theU Bureau since the last meeting of the Governing Body.5* Report of the Committee of Standing; Orders,&apos; (lotion of,&quot;IvV.&quot; Carlier;_subptitutesy^reform, of the Go^rniM, jSp^dyj.No copy of the Report of this Committee had reachedthe British Government,     Sir Kalcolm Delevingne will see, frcmthe remarks under item 2, that the Government do not favour the enlargement of the Governing Body.     In their view, itwould be better, on the analogy of the League of Nations, to regard the annual Conferences as being in the nature of aGeneral Assembly for the purpose of approving the proceedingsof the Governing Body, than to enlarge the latter in the hopeof making it more thoroughly representative.6*   Commissions of Enquiry.This is understood to be a formal report of thenominations made by the Governments under Article 4-12.7 *   Appointment of one Employers * and one Workers1 Member on the Joint Maritime&quot;Commission.The Cabinet understand that, under the terms of aResolution passed at the last meeting of the Governing Body,it falls to the present session to appoint two additional members, presumably representing Governments,- to the JointMaritime Commission of eight nominated by the Genoa Conference,4 employers viz.   Mr. Kbrdberg (Sweden), Mr. Deckers (Belgium)Mr, K, Hori (Japan) Mr. Robb (Canada) Mr. Cuthbert Laws(Great Britain), 4 seamen Mr. Rivelli (France) Mr. Giulietti(Italy) Mr. Coring (Germany) Mr. Nielsen (Norway).The British Government would wish to be represented on this Commission by an officer of the Marine department ofthtf Board of Trade.8.   Reference, to ffiavernln/^Boriy of ?rr. JoshVs request for the insertion on the Agenda of the next Conference of the question of primary education.
It is understood that Mr. Joshes request was received too late for consideration,.that is to say, after the Agenda for 1921 had been approved by the Governing Body for circu*-lation in accordance with its Standing Orders,    Mr. Joshi will presumably be so informed.    Apart from this fact, hovrever, it does not seen that the subject of primary education is one for the I.L.C,Conference*    In the view of the British Government the nearest approach to the problem that such Conferences can legitimately make is by adopting conventions or recommendations limiting the age of employment of children in industry, as had already been done at Washington and Genoa. 9. Use of Gerraan as an auxiliary language.On the assumption that this proposal does no more than to place the German language Upon the same footing as Spanish for the purposes of the International Labour Office, the British Government will raise no objection to this proposals10, Resolution of the International Congress of Miners that mFuMma^omlLe.^o\3T Office should pay special attention to the speedy establishment of an International Office for the ais^tTToiuTon of coaT7 mineral sand other materials ox primary importance *The attitude of the British Government to this proposal is indicated in the Minutes of a Meeting v/hich took place in Sir Montague Barlowf0 Room on 1st September, representative-Ives of the Board of Trade and the Coal Control were present and also Sir Balcolm; Delfcvingne.    (Sir Malcolm Delevingne has already received a copy of the memorandum embodying the con-elusion arrived at (copy is annexed) 11, Report of the Finance Committee,As fehe League of. Nations Secretariat is in no way res-ponslble for the amounts indented from its funds by the I.L.0,and it /
and it has been expressly ruled that the responsibility for expenditure of the I.L.O. rests&quot; upon the Governing Body, the British Government would wish to be kept informed of the financial position.12*    Date and place of the next Session*
Memorandum of Meeting held at Montagu House on September 1st.Present:Sir Montague Barlow    Parliamentary Secretary (Chairman)(Ministry of Labour). Sir Malcolm Delevlngne      (Home Office).Mr. Foley (Coal Control)Mr. Flux (Board of Trade)Mri Oswald Allen (Ministry of Labour)Sir Montague Barlow stated that he had been asked to take up the questions raised by the International Labour Office and the Director, M.Thomas, relating to coal. These questions seomed principally to be*1.     The demand that a representative of the International Labour Office should be a Member of the Committee or CoLomission at Bsaen.2.     The proposal of M. Thomas at the Miners1Conference at Geneva that the Intor-national Labour Office should in some way interest itself in a scheme for regulating the distribution of coal in Surope.As to 1. Mr. Foley explained that at Essen there are two Committees both under the Reparation Commission. The first Committee deals with distribution pure and simple and the second is the one referred to in paragraph 5 of the Protocol of the Conference at Spa on July 16th. This is a Committee or Commission including German representatives, whose object is to Improve the conditions of life amongst the miners &quot;in regard to food and clothing ..... with a view to a better worxing of the mines.&quot;    It is on this second Commission that presumably a representative of the International Labour Office is suggested./it
It was agreed that It was not desirable that the Inter-national Labour Office should have a representative on the second Commission for the following reasons.1,     This second Commission has boon appointed as a result of high diplomatic negotiations and its membership constituted presumably in the same Kay, and any claim by an outside body such as the International Labour Office for special representation, v/ould certainly cause difflenities *2.     The objects of the Commission are specifle, namely, to improve the conditions of food and clothing and have nothing to do with hours of labour.3t    There are German representatives to guard the interests of the German miners.14.     It was understood that the Reparation Commission in Paris have already considered and refused this demand of the International Labour Office.Sir Montague Barlow read a report from the Times news-paper of the statement by M*Thomas at the miners  Conference at Geneva during the first -eek in August, to the effect that if his Governing ^ody agreed he would be glad If the Labour Office in co-operation with the League of Nations could take up the question of the distribution of coal in Europe.It was agreed,li That any proposal that   M.Thomas or the Labour Office should, as an executive body^egulate i$he   distribution of coal in Europe^would be entirely out of the question2, That so far as any question of collecting statistics was concerned, it night be desirable that some such authority as the League of Nations should do t&apos; is.3. That if a Committee were set up under the1 Economic Section of the League of Nations which seemed the proper authority to take the lead then a Committee representative of various interests would probably be desirable and that the International Labour Office should be represented on such a Committee.
