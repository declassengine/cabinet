Brief Statement of the Purport of this Memorandum.THE allocation of the cost of military expenditure incurred in connection with, the East African campaign is one which requires early settlement. Since the opening of the operations in 1914 a great part of this expenditure has been charged to joint accounts between the Imperial Government on the one hand and the British Protectorates in East Africa (the East Africa Protectorate (now Kenya Colony), Uganda and Nyasaland) on the other, the intention being that the final allocation of these accounts should be taken up at the end of the War. This memorandum deals with (1) the allocation of these joint accounts; (2) the large question of what share of the total expenditure upon the campaign the British Protectorates named can and should bear.ii. Summary of the Present Position as to the Military Expenditure which is underReview.For present purposes the expenditure upon the campaign may be divided into four broad sections : (a.) Pay and allowances of British, Indian, South African and other troops sent to East Africa from overseas during the War. These were chargeable to the Imperial Exchequer (i.e., to the War Office), subject to the payment of part of the expenditure by India, the Union of South Africa, &amp;c.,&apos; under separate agreements. The Protectorates in East Africa were not concerned with this expenditure, and it is not necessary to give it further considera-tion here.(b.) Expenditure on &quot; Common Charges.&quot; It was found impossible in the case of supplies, stores, works, transport, &amp;c, to divide expenditure currently, and it was arranged, with Treasury sanction, that all &quot; Common Charges &quot; (i.e., practically everything except pay and allowances) should be charged to separate ,l Common Charges Accounts &quot; between the War Office and the British Protectorates in Eastern Africa. There are two such Common Charges Accounts, the East African Common Charges Account for the northern theatre and the much smaller Nyasaland Common Charges Account for the southern theatre. Both have been financed, in the first instance, by the War Office, and it was arranged that their allocation between the War Office and the Protectorates should stand over until the end of the War. An approximate estimate places the total of the East African Common Charges Account at 27,000,0002.(c.) Pay and allowances of the King&apos;s African Rifles. The King&apos;s African Rifles (native East African troops with European officers) at the strength of three battalions constituted the regular military garrison of the British Protectorates in Eastern Africa before the War. The expansion of the force for war purposes began with the outbreak of war, but it was not until 1916 that the systematic increase of the force, which ultimately led to its expansion to twenty-two battalions, was decided upon. During the last year or two of the campaign, the King&apos;s African Rifles formed a large portion of the total British force engaged. It was arranged that as from the 1st June, 1916, the cost of the pay and allowances of the Kings African Rifles should be charged to a joint account known as the King&apos;s African  Rifles  Account-between the War  Office  and  the British[4415] I I   B ,
Protectorates. Some proposals for deciding the ultimate incidence of the cost of this account were formulated, but they were not accepted by the Protectorate Governments, and the question is now one for settlement.. As regards the cost of the pay and allowances of the Kings African Rifles between the 4th August, 1914, and the 1st June, 1916, it was provisionally arranged that the Protectorates should bear the cost, subject to certain contributions from the War Office in respect of war additions to the normal establishment.(d.) Pay and allowances of locally-raised East African units other than King&apos;s African Rifles. In addition to the King&apos;s African Rifles, the Prdtectoriite Governments raised a number of European volunteer units, native labour units, and other subsidiary units in connection with the campaign. The European volunteer units were mainly raised at the very outbreak of war as an emergency measure for the defence of the Protectorates ; subsequently, on the arrival of expeditionary forces, they were, for the most part, broken up and the personnel distributed mainly among the subsidiary units,.such as the East African Military Labour Corps, which grew into &apos;a large organisation for controlling native labour for the whole East African force in connection with the campaign. At a very early stage of the operations, it was provisionally arranged that some of these units (i.e., those regarded simply as local,Protectorate units) should be a charge upon the Protectorate by and in which they were raised, whereas those which could be regarded as serving the whole East African force were treated as charges upon the Common Charges Accounts, and were thus classed as expenditure to be finally allocated between the War Office and the Protectorates later. It is necessary, however, to record that the Treasury and the War Office did hot accept the view that the pay and allowances of these Common Organisations were oh the same footing as other Common Charges.UI.--Cburse of Action proposed.The object of the present memorandum is to urge that all the expenditure^upon the whole campaign (including that summarised at (6), (c) and [d) in the preceding section) should be finally borne by the Imperial Government, the Protectorate Governments in Eastern Africa confining their contributions towards the cost of the campaign to a sum based on the military expenditure provided for in the 1914 (i.e., pre-war) estimates of each Protectorate (i.e., for King&apos;s African Rifles and Volunteers), this sum being paid retrospectively from 1914 to 1918 inclusive. The reasons which make this course desirable, and indeed vitally necessary, from the point of view of the Protectorate Governments are summarised below: (a.) In the first place, it would in present circumstances be literally impossible for ihe Governments of the East African Protectorate (Kenya), Uganda and Nyasaland to pay for the campaign beyond the basis now proposed. Nyasaland and Uganda are scarcely self-supporting and are. still under Treasury control, while the financial.position of the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya) is so insecure that there is some doubt whether, quite apart from this question of military expenditure, it will be in a position to pay its way in the near future. The only method, in fact, by which these Governments could possibly meet any such charges would be by means of an annual payment to the Imperial Government, which would necessarily be spread over many years, and would cripple their development for a long time to come. . , ,(b.) It is submitted that the share taken by the East African Protectorates in the campaign against. German East Africa and their close concern in it is primarily&apos; due to the geographical accident of their proximity to German territory, and that it would be inequitable that on this account they should be saddled with.a financial burden entirely put of proportion to their resources. The Protectorates contributed to the campaign to the utmost of their power, and placed the whole of their resources at the disposal of the Imperial Government for the purpose of the operations. Practically the entire European population of the Protectorates was utilised in connec-tion with the campaign, and the number of natives raised for combatant and non-combatant purposes..amounts to hundreds of thousands. It has inevitably followed *lhat, as a direct result of the operations against German
East Africa, and apart from the effect of the War as a whole, the trade of the Protectorates has &quot;been paralysed and their powers of production and development have been gravely interfered with. The loss to the Protectorates through the deaths and illnesses of officials, of European non-officials, and of native inhabitants, has alone seriously arrested progress and diminished their resources; and the set-back which they have suffered can only be made good by devoting to their development all the funds which can be made available from revenue or loan moneys. It is essential that these factors should &apos;be taken into account when the question of determining the amount of their financial contributions to the cost of the local operations is under consideration.,(c.) Reconstruction and development in East Africa and post-war problems, such as currency, labour and shipping, must be regarded as &quot;Imperial questions no less than as local ones.. To the Imperial Government the additional burden of relieving the : Protectorate Governments of any part Of the cost of the campaign would be small compared with the whole cost of the War, whereas to the local Protectorate Governments any material contribution would mean, in effect, a crushing burden of debt, which would retard their progress for years, and-might even throw them all back as charges upon the Imperial Exchequer. It is urged that a broad view should be taken of i the matter,; and thai the total cost of the military expenditure in question should be borne by the Imperial Government, subject to the contributions proposed above, which are, in effect, the maximum which the Protectorate Governments can afford to pay.(d.) It is recognised that the present proposals are not consistent with the provisional decisions taken as regards the final allocation of the military expenditure. It is submitted, however, that the previous arrangements, such as those by which the Protectorate Governments undertook to bear the cost of their locally-raised volunteer units and of King&apos;s African Rifles beyond their peace establishment and those arrangements by which it was implied that the Protectorate Governments should ultimately bear some&apos;share of the Common Charges Accounts and the King&apos;s African Rifles Account, were arrived at, for the most part, at an early stage of the operations, when it was thought that the campaign would be a short one and that the Protectorates would be in a financial position enabling &quot;them to meet &quot;such charges. The whole position has, in fact, changed since these early arrangements were made. The campaign, so far from being a short one, lasted the whole length of the War, and the Common Charges Accounts have thus reached totals enormously greater than was ever contemplated at the time when they were instituted. More-over, the ability of the Protectorates to pay has, for reasons explained above, decreased as the charges to be paid have increased. These circum-stances afford ample justification for disregarding previous arrangements and opening the question Of the Protectorates&apos; contributions &apos;de novo. A more recent precedent is, in fact, the case of the contribution of ,the Government of the Gold Coast to the cost of the contingent which it sent to East Africa to take part in the campaign. In this case exactly the same arrangement was followed as is now proposed for the East African Govern-ments, i.e.&apos;, the total cost of the contingent was borne by the War Office, and the Gold Coast Government paid over to thelmperlalGovernment the estimated provision for military expenditure which it did not require owing to the &quot;despatch of part of its garrison overseas.(e.) Finally, it may be pointed out that the essentially Imperial character of the operations against &quot;German &quot;East Africa, recognised at the outset by the despatch of an Expeditionary Force from India, became more and more obvious as the War progressed. The depredations of the &quot; Emden,&quot; the inability of the small naval forces which ;could be spared for East African waters to maintain a.strict blocka.de, the operations of armed raiders, and i ultimately the extension of submarine warfare, point to the menace which Empire and Allied traffic in the East would, have had to face if German East Africa had-not been reduced,; and the. Imperial, importance of German ;East Africa, with its seaboard of 800. miles, commanding the Indian, Australian -and;Far Eastern.trade.-routes, has been admitted by the accept-ance of the mandate for the administration of the country. By the immediate response of the European inhabitants to the call to arms, and[4415] B 2
by the heavy drain on the able-bodied native populations, the Protectorates&apos; contribution to the result of the War far exceeds in value any money payment which they could be asked to bear, and deserves material and generous recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government.IV. Some Points of Detail.For the sake of clearness and simplicity only the broad outlines of the general question have been given in this memorandum. There are, in fact, various points of detail connected with the general question of East African military expenditure which require settlement.   Such are (a.) The position of the Protectorate Governments in relation to the finance of the East African Salvage Commission, to which they originally supplied material and from which they later made certain purchases.(b.) The revenue received by the Uganda Railway in respect of military traffic.(c.) The remission, or otherwise, of Customs duties by the Protectorate Govern-ments upon imported goods bought locally by the military authorities, and the levying of such duties on goods imported duty free by those authorities and sold by the Salvage Commission to private persons.It is probable, however, that the claims and counterclaims represented by the above could be settled without difficulty by inter-departmental correspondence when once the larger question of the incidence of the cost of East African military expenditure generally has been decided. There are, however, two subordinate questions to which it is necessary to draw attention.(1.) Military Pensions.Hitherto all disability compensation, dependants&apos; compensation, &amp;c, granted in respect of members of the King&apos;s African Rifles and East African local forces has been provisionally charged to the joint Kings African Rifles Account, in the case of the former, and to the Common Charges Accounts (subject to a few exceptions), in the case of the latter, and the final allocation was to depend upon the allocation of these joint accounts. If the principle advocated in this memorandum is accepted, i.e., that the total expenditure upon the campaign should fall upon the Imperial Government subject to a contribution from each Protectorate based upon its 1914 Estimates provision for military expenditure, it will follow that the Protectorates will be relieved of all liability for the cost of disability and dependants&apos; compensation granted to and in respect of members, whether European or native, of the King&apos;s African Rifles and local East African forces disabled or killed as a result of the campaign against German East Africa, and that this expenditure will be borne by the Ministry of Pensions. Here again the precedent of the West African contingents sent to East Africa would be closely followed; in that case all disability compensation awarded is a final charge against the Ministry of Pensions. At present all compensation awarded to and in respect of European personnel of the .King&apos;s African Rifles and East African local forces is actually administered by the Ministry of Pensions under Imperial regulations, but the cost of the awards made by the Ministry is recovered periodically by them from the joint accounts. The arrangement now proposed, i.e., to make the Ministry.of Pensions responsible for all such compensation financially as well as administratively, would thus involve no change in the present arrangements for awarding and paying the compensation.(2.) Position of Zanzibar.Zanzibar stands in a somewhat different relation to the question of expenditure upon the German East Africa campaign from the other three Protectorates (East Africa Protectorate (Kenya), Uganda and Nyasaland) Zanzibar has remained somewhat outside the sphere of the operations and has not been a base of attack against the former German Protectorate from the military, as opposed to the naval, point of view. The effect of this is that though Zanzibar has contributed largely in material resources to the campaign and
has had to incur additional expenditure within the Protectorate for its own defence as a result of the campaign, it has not participated in the King&apos;s African Rifles Account or the Common Charges Accounts, so that no question arises of a contribution from .Zanzibar in connection with the allocation of those accounts. Apart from the assistance to the local campaign mentioned above, the contribution of the Zanzibar Government towards the cost of the War has taken the form of direct money gifts to the Imperial Exchequer amounting to 70,OOOL in all. In view of this it is submitted that, although Zanzibar is in a more favourable position financially than the other three Protectorates, and has not suffered as severely as they in material prosperity as a result of the local campaign, the principle upon which the Zanzibar Government should contribute financially to the cost of the local campaign should be the same as&apos; in the case of the others, i.e., that the Imperial Government should assume liability for the whole and that the Protectorate Government should pay over a sum based on its pre-war military budget.:  M.September 27, 1920.
