SUMMARY.RUSSIA.The present position in Russia is described from a great diversity of sources to be bordering on catastrophic. Prospects for the harvest are very poor. The disorders which started in Russia at the end of July have been increasing in frequency and now constitute a serious menace to the Soviet power. The influence of the Third International abroad has during the past month operated mainly towards a severance of the extreme communist elements in all countries from Moderate Socialists, and even from Communists willing to accept the Third International on their own terms.SIBERIA.Particular attention is drawn to the article appearing in Part IT. of this issue entitled &quot;An American Merchant-Adventurer in Moscow.&quot;ITALY.The occupation of the Italian iron and steel works is the. subject of a special chapter. The participation of the Soviet Government in the seizure of the factories is proved by a report to his Government by Vodovosoff, the Soviet representative in Italy, that the strike has reduced his funds by 2,000,000 lire. The lack of connection between the different important centres makes the chances of an immediate revolution unlikely.GERMANY.In spite of the fact that a large section of the German Independent Socialists has recently declared for Moscow, extremists have been losing ground. A careful observer is confident that. the German proletariat would not tolerate Bolshevism under any conditions. Only in the unlikely eventuality of a repetition of something like the Kapp Putsch would there be a danger of armed rising on the part of the Reds. -PRANCE.The situation as regards social stability and industrial output is steadily improving. The resolution of the Congress of the C.G.T. at Orleans of an overwhelming majority decided that the French Labour Movement should in future be kept clear from all political parties.NORWAY.Litvinoff has left Norway for Moscow, having completely failed in his mission, and is now barred from all the principal countries in which die could usefully exercise his talents; England, Italy, Sweden, and &quot;Denmark refuse to receive him, and Norway will not have him back.SWEDEN.Bolshevik influence is on the decline. At the recent elections for the Second Chamber extremists lost four seat9. The exposure of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; and its financial dealings with Strom are believed to have inclined waverers towards the Right.DENMARK.Syndicalist leaders have deferred their decision to adhere to the Third International, partly out of resentment at LitviuofPs dictatorial attitude,
HOLLAND.Holland is still refractory to Communist influence. It is confirmed that the Amsterdam Sub-Bureau of the Third International has not closed down. Wynkoop has been recognised by Moscow as head of the Dutch Communists. Internal trouble in the party there is daily increasing.SPAIN.The situation generally is very serious. Strikes are reported in progress throughout the country.PORTUGAL.Senhor Grranho&apos;s rather infirm government has been put in an awkward dilemma by the amnesty question.POLAND.The occupation of Vilna and insistence in the peace negotiations at Riga upon an outlet via the Dvina are reliably reported to be supplemented by intrigues for the establishment of a White Russian Republic at Minsk. The connivance of White Russian delegates is believed to have been obtained.EGYPT.iFeeling in Egypt and Switzerland is reported to be in favour of the Agreement, and the majority of the delegates are willing to sign. Zaghloul and one or two extremists are holding out, it is thought, for reasons of personal prestige.UNITED STATES OP AMERICA.Competent observers in presidential circles estimate the chances of Senator Harding as about three to one.American sympathies have been alienated from the cause of Ireland by the tactics of de Valera, whose alleged relations with Bolshevik extremists identify him with the disruptive elements which Americans hate.The breach between ultra-radicals and moderate labour appears to be steadily widening.ESTHONIA.State bankruptcy is regarded as imminent. The reduction in the output of grain brings the country face to face with starvation during the winter.TURKEY.The popularity of the Government among educated classes is said to be on the wane, and the military situation of the Nationalists in Auatolia is reported to be bad.PERSIA.Enver Pasha is reported to have told the Persians that a government independent of British influence would be respected and guaranteed by Soviet Russia,CANADA.The labour situation is easier.

CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.Political and Social.The situation both as regards social stability and industrial output is steadily improving. Notwithstanding all the efforts of Bolshevism and Syndicalism, the French workers are reported now to be applying them-selves as they have never done since the War. M. Millerand&apos;s election is regarded with satisfaction by all sections of the business community. His handling of the railway strike inspired confidence, and is in a great measure responsible for the present favourable state of things.Extremists would have preferred the election of a member of the Right, like Marshal Focb or General Castelneau, since such an election might have set up a ferment among the workmen which they might have inten-sified for their own ends. The advent of M. Millerand is a consecration of republican-conservative politics and of desire for the peaceful economic development of the country.The steadiness of French labour can be deduced from the fact that recent happenings in Italy do not appear to have had the slightest effect upon French workers, and the division between the small section of out-and-out revolutionaries and the moderate Socialists is becoming more marked.Communist propaganda.The Federation de la Seine du Parti Socialiste, which contained adherents both to the Second and Third Internationals, has split into two factions, each with its own headquarters. The breaking away of the Moderate Socialists from the extreme elements and the consequent complete control of the situation by the Government has enabled the management in many industries to dismiss agitators.The leaders of the Soviet Government now regard France as the centre of the sort of reaction likely to be most dangerous to their aspirations. The extremists, Cachin and Frossard, on their return from the Second Congress of the Third International at Moscow, duly recom-mended that the French Party should adhere to the programme there given out. Moscow, however, has not full and entire confidence in either of the delegates, and has not entrusted them with funds for propaganda. The Soviet Government is now trying to co-ordinate propaganda in France and Germany, and has given Daumig, the leader of the German Independent Socialists, 300,000 francs for this purpose in the two countries, the sum to be equally divided. Daumig, however, is only authorised to give money to the French when Cachin and Frossard have organised a Communist Party in France which will officially adhere to the Russian Bolshevik programme.From the point of view of the Communist, international control of one country by the other no doubt appears to be an appropriate measure,
but it remains to bo seen whether Moscow will altogether succeed in driving this ill-assorted pair in double harness.Cachin wrote to Daumig in September that he was having some difficulty in the formation of a really reliable French Communist Party, as the French Syndicalist leaders and Longuet&apos;s group, by their strong counter-action, were prejudicing propaganda for the Third International. Probably Moscow is not wrong in thinking that French extremist leaders are slippery people, and it will not be without precedent if, by certain influences brought to bear upon them, Cachin and Frossard are gradually diverted to paths of greater moderation.The C.G.T, and the Socialist Party Congress.The Minority extremists held their first annual Congress on 5th September, when they decided to continue their revolutionary propaganda within the ranks of the C.G.T. A few hot-heads advocated separation and enforced decision upon the part of waverers. The more level-headed were unwilling to sacrifice their influence and the opportunity of spreading their propaganda within the organisation itself.It was considered probable that Jouhaux and his friends would emerge triumphant from the Congress of the C.G.T. at Orleans, and that a policy openly hostile to the revolutionaries would then be adopted. This prophecy has, in fact, been accomplished. A resolution was passed by 1,482 votes against 691, and recommended that the French Labour movement should in future be kept clear from all political parties. This means, in effect, that the French Labour Party will remain affiliated to the Second International and will cut all its connections with the Communist Party and with Moscow. The decision of the French Socialist Party at its congress at Orleans on October 12th, when the question of adherence to the Moscow International will be discussed, is awaited with interest.BELGIUM.Extremists.The latest revolutionary group in Belgium is called &quot; Les Amis de l&apos;Exploite &quot; and seeks to relace other groups whose efforts at publicity, propaganda, and other activities have led them into financial difficulties. Their organ, &quot; L&apos;Exploite,&quot; seems to have plenty of unsold copies. At a recent meeting of the Brussels group, 50 of these Avere taken by each member for distribution in workshops, offices, and about the streets.The proposed Franco-Belgian military alliance is being much discussed by Socialists, especially in the Flemish provinces. It is anticipated that a split in the Socialist Party may take place when a general election is forced in November.Van Overstraeten, the Belgian representative at the Congress of the Third International at Amsterdam in February 1920, is reported to advocate eveiy kind of pressure, whether by threat, strike, or sabotage, upon the Government to bring about a renewal of commercial relations with Russia.The case of the dying Lord Mayor of Cork was exciting an evanescent interest in Flemish circles towards the end of August.ITALY,The Seizure oi the Factories.The part taken by the Soviet Government in the conflict is made clear by a report to his Government by Vodovosoff that the strike has reduced the funds of the Soviet Government by 2,000,000 lire.
As remarked elsewhere, the lack of connection between the different important centres makes the chances of an immediate revolution unlikely. Henceforward the men will participate in the technical and economic control of the factories. No wages are to be paid for the three weeks of forcible occupation, but the existing scale of wages is to be advanced by 20 per cent, as from 15th July. The workers are now believed to have attained the maximum the present system can admit. A further step will lead Italy either to industrial anarchy or something resembling the Soviet system.Extremist Agitation.Several Italian Socialists, including Turati, now share the censure passed by Lenin ou Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, and have been excluded from the Third International.The conferences of revolutionaries at Bologna, assembled on the 28th and 29th August on the initiative of railway syndicalists, decided to intensify the agitation in favour of an amnesty for political victims and in defence of Soviet Russia. The Anarchist meeting recently held at Bologna discussed the question of an Anarchist International, and decided to use the Soviet as a means to attain that end.Subversive propaganda is taking a Separatist form at Trieste and generally in Italia Redeuta, where, since the war, the population appears to have been entirely disillusioned, and to have in some cases instituted a boycott of Italian goods. There is fear in some quarters that if and when Fiume is proclaimed-an independent state the Triestini may attempt to join up with it.Bolshevik Forged Notes.The appearance of false 1,000 lira notes in Italy, said by the Socialist press to be of Spanish or Portuguese origin, but certainly of Bolshevik manufacture, has led to extreme nervousness on the part of cashiers and the public generally, who refuse to accept even good notes of this denomi-nation.   It has had a distinct effect on circulation.A special article on the occupation by the workers of the iron and steel works throughout Italy appears in Part II. of this issue.SPAIN.The situation generally must be described as very serious, although it will not necessarily culminate in alsolute revolution.&apos; The lull in the more active manifestations of labour unrest has not continued, and the settlement of a few minor disputes has not led to a cessation of the principal strikes, which are reported to be in progress throughout the whole country.Public opinion is reported still to be on the side of Senor Dato, despite the unpopularity which he has incurred by the King&apos;s recent dissolution of the Cortes at his request. Liberal organs make some parade of hostility against the King, and dwell upon the necessity of reforming the Constitution forthwith, to prevent the repetition of the manoeuvre, while Socialists and Republicans have redoubled their press campaign against the present Government. The Government has incurred less opposition on this account among the factions of the extreme Right, but Senor Dato is being criticised, even by extremist Conservatives, on his support of the increase in the railway tariffs a Rothschild interest, which Senor Dato, as the legal representative of that firm in Spain, is said to be concerned to further.
As reprisal for the Spanish Governments decision to cope with unrest in Barcelona by the suspension of the right of trial by jury throughout the province, the governor of the city was immediately shot.Labour.The fusion of the two most important parties in the Labour world, the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo, the extremist body adhering to the Third International, Avith the more moderate Union General do Trabajadores, has been the event of the month. It is likely to lead to a move to the Left on the part of the United body. The fusion is the culmination of efforts which have been going on for some time, especially in the mining districts of the north, to seduce members of the Union from their allegiance and to bring them into the Syndicalist ranks. In the event of Allied interference with the affairs of Soviet Russia the united body will order strikes against the export of coal or manufacture of munitions. It is also thought that it will continue and intensify the Syndicalist efforts (unsuccessful except in the case of a few disaffected regiments) to undermine the loyalty of tho troops. The new state of affairs will, to say the least, not tend to a cessation of the assassinations, sabotage, and unjustified strikes with which Spain has recently been so rife.The Germans.The newly formed Banco de Madrid is reported as a centre of employment for German agents. It is reckoned that 11,000 Germans have passed through Spain, mostly en route for South America, during the last six months.PORTUGAL.The amnesty question has put Senhor Granho&apos;s rather infirm govern-ment in an awkward dilemma, as the risk to the stability of the govern-ment which it entails displeases the Democrats and Popular Party, while if the amnesty is not granted the Sidonistas may stir up trouble.On the 5th October, the tenth anniversary of Portugal becoming a Republic, a petition was signed by commercial authorities and leaders in Lisbon asking for pardon for political prisoners.A Commission of Food Supplies, consisting of members of all the large commercial and industrial associations, has been formed and financed. An attack recently made on the Syndicalist paper &quot; Batalha&quot; by a party of unknown people resulted in the destruction of type set up ready for printing. The failure of a general strike ordered in protest disillusioned the C.G.T. by demonstrating the weak hold of their leaders upon the proletariat.More recently, however, the C.G.T., with the occult support of avowed revolutionary communists deriving funds from Germany.and Russia, has been trying to engineer a general strike against the cost of living, beginning by a railway, post, and telegraph strike in the second week of October.Late advices show that a beginning of this strike has, at any rate, been made.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. NORWAY.Extremists.As&apos; in other countries, the programme of the Third International, which has been made-compulsory for all organisations affiliated with
Moscow, is tending to cause a split in the ranks of the Extremists in Norway a rift which is likely to be increased by the anti-Bolshevik measures taken by the Government.If the Moscow programme is to be adhered to, many of the Socialist M.P.s who sire members of the Norwegian Labour Party will have to be expelled, and in some cases their influence is so great that Kyrre Grepp is afraid to take any action ; for this reason he intends shortly to travel to Moscow to seek some adaptation of the programme of 21 points to Norwegian conditions. Leuin&apos;s insistence on the complete subjection of all Trade Unions to Moscow also militates ia Trade Union circles against the full acceptance of the 21 points. Late in September the Executive of the Norwegian Trade Unions decided to postpone a decision regarding the conditions laid down by Moscow.The extremists are carrying ou violent propaganda in favour of complete submission to Moscow, and for this propaganda it is reliably reported that funds have been received from Moscow. An increase, in September, of copies of the Scandinavian Young Socialist weeklies and periodicals is worthy of note. Further, there is a notable increase of travelling Communist agitators lecturing throughout Scandinavia.The situation is most acute in the north, where, early in September, it was reported that Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Councils had been formed and were ready for action. Naval forces and a number of troops sent into the northern districts and the northern bases by the Government had the effect of forestalling.any immediate outbreak in these districts.One of the conditions proposed to the Norwegian Government by Litvinoff in his negotiations for the resumption of trade was that he should be permitted to place Soviet agents in all the northern ports.A non-political association similar to that recently formed in Denmark and other countries has been formed by trade organisations to place itself at the disposal of the authorities if and when important functions of society are threatened. It stipulates that it shall only be called in as a last resort.Litvinoffs Negotiations.After innumerable and contrary shifts and shuffles on the part of the applicant the Norwegian Government, towards the end of August, gave Litvinoff permission to proceed to Christiania from Copenhagen for the purpose of entering upon negotiations towards the establishment of trade, and even political relations. Between the time when his departure was mooted and the time of his arrival a change, however, took place in the attitude of the Government, which military events in the south had induced to modify its benevolent policy towards Russia and to look to London as its weathercock. In according Litvinoff permission of entry the Government laid stress on the fact that it had found the caprices and often contradictory demands in which he had indulged during the period of the advance into Poland fatiguing.On arrival litvinoff got into touch with Traumael and Olaf Scheflo, Friis, and Madsen, the leading Norwegian extremists. Despite an under-taking to refrain from propaganda or interference in the internal affairs of the country he was soon in daily contact with the Norwegian Bolshevik Council.Litvinoff had a bad press from the first, and in negotiating with him the Government acted with extreme reserve. The refusal of the British Government to receive the Russian Labour Delegates was interpreted by Norwegian Labour as a sign that; there would be no revolution in the United Kingdom, and that in case of a revolution in Norway active pressure might be brought to bear by the British Government.
tn his disappointment with the polite hut firm attitude of tho Norwegian Government and with the IKorwogian Labour L&apos;arty&apos;s inability to support his policy by mass action, Litvinoff appears, as usual, to have lost his temper. He considered that the press was intriguing against him. He incited the Holsheviks to collect material which might compromise the French Legation and reveal the activities of French diplomacy against the Scandinavian Bolsheviks. Towards the middle of September, Kameneff, on his way from England, informed Litvinoff that he was in possession of information very damaging to Mr. Lloyd&apos;George, which he would publish when all hope of an agreement with England had been given up.The disclosures, should they be made, will no doubt amount to nothing more than attempts to shake the stability of the Entente.Litvinoff was reported as much affected by the hostile influence brought to bear upon him by the small but relatively powerful group of German Socialists in Norway. He was advised by Kyrre Grepp that a stranding of the negotiations and his own departure would be a serious blow to tho Bolshevik ranks, evidence of whose faltering was apparent in the failure of the propaganda week of the Young Socialists and the obvious efforts of the Norwegian Labour Party to win Labour for the programme of the Communist International.Meanwhile the arrest of Alfred Madsen, editor of the extremist paper &quot; Ny Tid,&quot; of Trondhjein, and the seizure of the Bolshevik gold which lie was carrying, had created a very strong anti-Bolshevik feeling iu Norway, where non-Bolshevik elements show signs of increasing unity of mind and action. The publication of the new programme of the Communist International opened the eyes of many Socialists, and even such extreme leaders as Torgeir and Vraa started a campaign against the dictatorship of Moscow.All these circumstances caused Litvinoff&apos; to keep very quiet, and prevented a conclusion of the negotiations. His one endeavour in the end was to extend his sojourn in Christiania in order to obtain even small results. Norwegiau merchants, however, object to the rigorous demands of Moscow, and the Norwegiau Government, backed by public opinion, was firm in its refusal to recognise Soviet Russia. With this refusal Litvinoffs real task came to an end, and he left Norway on 4th October for Moscow, having, completely failed in his mission.Russian Subsidies.Towards the end of August the Customs authorities at Vardo discovered in the cabin of Alfred Madsen, editor of the extremist paper &quot; Ny Tid,&quot; of Trondhjem, a large consignment of gold belonging to the Soviet Government and addressed to their representative in Norway. Though, after his arrest, his sub-editor stated that the money was really destined for the fisher folk in the North to pay for fish to be sent to Russia, Madsen himself unfortunately stated next day that it was intended to support the enhanced status of the Soviet diplomatic representative which was anticipated to follow the official recognition of Soviet Russia.Although the importation of gold in Norway for legitimate purposes is not illegal, Madsen chose to smuggle the gold in at considerable personal risk by taking it across a stretch of water in a small motor boat. The money thus surreptitiously introduced was certainly intended for no good, and opinion was at the time divided as to whether it was destined to institute official Soviet representation at Folkets Hus, or whether the gold was intended for some other country, possibly for Great Britain.
Meanwhile Scheflo, another extremist, actually succeeded in coft-surveying to Norway another sum of money, which was to be used to create Red patches in the army, and Jacob Friis, having been appointed liaison officer between tlie Soviet and the Norwegian Labour Party, received a third considerable sum from Lenin.SWEDEN.General.Bolshevik influence is sadly on the decline.In August last Baron Palmstierna brought to the knowledge of his colleagues an overwhelming case against the Bolsheviks dealing more especially with their hopes and intentions in Scandinavia.Details regarding Litvinoffs activities in this direction were particu-larly illuminating, and the Swedish Government now decline to readmit him to their country. A little later Schliapnikoff, who was arrested at Stockholm for having forged his visa, was ordered to leave Sweden.These measures did not immediately put an end to Soviet activities in Scandinavia. Scandinavian Bolshevik workers are to be encouraged in every way to go to Russia, and 150,000 roubles in gold have been paid to the Central Committee in Stockholm to subsidise three Bolshevik schools in Sweden.The exposure of the &quot;Daily Herald &quot; and its financial dealings with Strom was much discussed in the press, and is believed to have inclined waverers towards the Right.The Elections.At the recent elections for the Second Chamber in Sweden all the parties of the Right made progress and all the parties of the Left have gone back. The extremists have lost four seats. The Bolshevik party was completely defeated, and derives its mandate in the new Riksdag only from the extreme north of Sweden.Aaland Islands.Sweden was reported in September to be by no means inclined to submit to an adverse decision by the League of Nations regarding the Aaland Islands. Secret preparations for the defence of these islands in the event of such a decision were made, and a force of 3,500 men was held in readiness for despatch. Orders for aeroplanes and heavy artillery had then been placed in Germany.DENMARK.Syndicalists and Socialists.Until the arrival of Litvinofi&apos; in Copenhagen the Syndicalists and Socialists were bitterly opposed to one another. Litvinoff, however, for a time seems to have managed to eliminate their differences so that nearly all the leaders, including Christen sen, accepted the programme of the Third International. The Danish Syndicalist leaders in favour of joining were Maria Nielsen and Andersen Nexoe. Litvinoff arranged for the former to attend the recent Congress of the Third International in Moscow, which she left to do, intending to proclaim the adhesion to it of the Danish Syndicalist Party. Whether she had full authority to do this is not clear. It would appear that she had not. The Syndicalists sent a telegram after her to Moscow forbidding her to make a definite declara-tion, which nevertheless she did. The discouraging telegram was, in fact, held up by the Soviet Authorities.   Maria Nielsen returned to
Copenhagen with the blessing of Moscow and funds for the unwilling converts. The incident was so eloquent of Soviet methods that it did much to renew the quarrels which Litvinoff had patched up. The Syndicalist leaders, moreover, resent LitvinofTs putting Aage Joergensen into the position of director of the whole Syndicalist revolutionary move-ment in Denmark and have now further deferred their decision to adhere to the Third International.The Conference of the International Metal Workers resolved, early in September, to use every means to prevent war against Soviet Russia and Socialists in general and to stop work if war were declared. Leaflets in English appealing to British sailors to refuse to move ammunition at Dantzic were thrown ou board British and French warships at Copen-hageiii Litvinoffs complicity in this mode of propaganda has been traced.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOLLAND.The Amsterdam Bureau.It is confirmed that the Amsterdam sub-Bureau of the Third Inter-national has uot been closed down. VVyukoop has, in fact, been recog-nised by Moscow as the head of the Dutch Communists, and is specially charged with carrying out their mission in Holland. He is in direct communication with Russia by courier, and has a representative in Moscow. Lenin&apos;s public disavowal of the Bureau was, as has already been stated in our June number, due to the fact that it was about to engage in Sinn Fein propaganda, which it could not openly do as long as negotiations were not broken off in London. The official representative in Holland is the Rev. Kruyt, through whom all such open questions as that of the exchange of prisoners, &amp;c., are discussed.Meanwhile the archives of the sub-Bureau of the Third International in Amsterdam and other Dutch towns are to be enlarged, and a new courier system between Vienna and England, via Holland, is to be inaugurated, so that Bronsky, the head of the unofficial Soviet Mission in Austria, may be in closer touch, with the Russian Mission in England. It is interesting to note that a member of Bronsky&apos;s staff is one Frederick Kuh, au American, who is the Vienna correspondent of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and whose articles in that paper may therefore be considered to reflect the official Soviet view with uncommon exactitude.Communists.Holland itself, however, is still refractory to Communist influence. Internal trouble in the Party is daily increasing. Attempts of the Communist Parly to make the Trade Union movement dependent upon them and, by the orders of Moscow, to establish the International Council of Trades Unions in opposition to the Amsterdam Trade Union International, have made the situation more acute. The official Com-munist Party, however, which enjoys the backing of Moscow, will probably be strengthened by the adhesion of the numerous small Com-munist divisions composed of men who, in a largo number of industries, are slipping off from the Unions and to whom inducements to join the International Council of Trade Unions will be held out. Financially the Communists are in low water, and two of their papers barely survive.Sneevliet, the notorious Dutch Communist, was to proceed direct from Moscow, where he had been present at the Second Congress of the Third International, to Japan, thence to carry out propaganda in the
British and Dutch East Indies. This plan, however, appears to have been temporarily postponed, and Siieevliet is reported to have returned to Holland instead of proceeding to the East from Moscow.The progress of the National Union against revolution was reported to be extremely satisfactory. A general meeting will be held in October.GERMANY. Relations with Soviet Russia.The policy of the German Government towards Russia previous to the collapse of the Soviet armies consisted in a strict neutrality to be maintained except in case of violation of German territory ; in case of any such violation au intense appeal to national feeling to unite against the invader ; and a non-political modus vivendi with Russia with a view to development of industry and commerce in both countries.At the end of July one, Reinbcder, of the Bolshevik General Staff, was sent as special representative of Soviet Russia to come to some agreement with Dr. Simons in view of the over-running of Poland, which was then considered to be impending. Dr. Simons agreed to maintain German neutrality on the Polish question ; to prevent munitions sup-plied by the Entente crossing German territory ; to destroy dumps of arms in East Prussia rather than have them handed over to the Entente ; to take steps to prevent provocation by German reactionary groups in East Prussia. Russia agreed, on the other hand, that the integrity of the German frontier would not be violated, though Russia was to proceed to the end with the obliteration of Poland. The Polish corridor would be restored to Germany, and Russia undertook to refrain from propaganda in this corridor. On the geueral question of the continuance of Bolshevik propaganda in Germany, considerable argument took place. Reinboder argued that as the German Red Army had originally been formed and developed out of the unemployed in Germany, and as, when raw materials arrived from Russia, such unemployment would cease, there was, therefore, no need for Russia to give any specific undertaking on this point; he also frankly told Dr. Simons that the German Red Army was a useful lever for the Russian Soviet Government against Germany. In conclusion it was agreed that the Russian Government would stop Bolshevist propaganda in Germany and would withdraw all support from the German Red Army on condition that Germany should deliver agricultural implements, machinery, war material, and equipment to be paid for in gold by the Soviet Government, as well as with such raw material as was ready and available in Russia. Reinboder went on to say that after over-running Poland Russia would attack Hungary, thereby levelling a blow at French influence and even threatening France herself.The German Government has never withdrawn its recognition of the reactionary Russian Legation and Consulate at Berlin, and these offices have continued throughout to protest against any alliance or agreement between Germany and Bolshevik Russia. Kopp, after consultation with Tchitcherin, who advised him to desist from complaint, spoke about the activities of the reactionaries to the German Foreign Minister on the ground that the two reactionary offices were carrying on in Germany a policy opposed to that agreed upon between the German Government and himself.   He does not appear to have received satisfaction.The Government has had to bear reproaches from the other side also ; the Russian Monarchist, Gutchkoff, accuses tho Germans of playing a double game in that they showed  themselves favourable to the
Monarchists while, in reality, they were treating with the Bolshevists, and concluded by threatening Hugo Stinnes with severe economic reprisals upon Germany as soon as Russia was ou her feet. Stinnes, in consequence, requested the German financial consortium again to sub-sidise tho Russian reactionaries. The Russian Monarchist Committee was accordingly reconstituted, and decided to enter into negotiations with all Russian refugees in America and Japan with a view to a reunion of the Russian parties in France to organise the fight against the Bolsheviks. All these anti-Bolshevik organisations, when developed, were to be placed under General Wrangel. Numerous recruiting agents have been sent to Vienna and Prague.Kopp&apos;s purchases of arms in Germany for the Bolshevik army have compromised him both with the German Government and with his own. The Russian Government is no longer satisfied with his results, and proposes to replace him. In the earlier part of February it sent three Bolsheviks to Berlin from Kovno to buy arms and ammunition, with orders not to enter into relations with Kopp, ostensibly in order to avoid compromising him. James Reich is also to be replaced on account of his failure to maintain a courier service betAveen Berlin and Moscow.Anti-British Intrigue.Divers nationalities subject to British oppression are still hard at work under Bolshevik guidance in Germany. A certain Colonel Emerson, au Irish American, who, in tho day of the Germans, was paid by them as a propagandist and anti-British intriguer in the East, is now working for the Bolsheviks. As President of the German branch of the Irish Revolutionary Society he summoned a meeting of representatives of Oriental groups in Berlin. He takes Ireland as a model, and tells Persians and Indians to emulate Sinn Feiners in making new laws which the people of the country will obey, to the neglect of British authority. He announced to a Persian representative that the Soviet had acknow ledged the existence of the Revolutionary Indian Party as the de facto government of India, and invited him to send a Persian representative to Moscow to ask the Soviet to recognise Persian independence in a like manner.It is reported that the Bavarian Monarchist League is despatching, via Stettin and Hamburg, war material destined for Ireland, and that the German-Irish Society at Munich is engaged in similar consignments.Enver Pasha arrived in Berlin when Bolshevik victory appeared certain. He was instructed by Djemal Pasha to recruit a staff&apos; of German officers for Mustapha. Kemal, and brought with him letters of recommendation from the Soviet Government. He saw Ludendorff, who agreed to favour this recruiting ou condition that he should not be officially compromised. At the first rumours of Bolshevik defeat he hurried lack to Moscow.Extremists.Extremists have recently been losing ground in Germany. A careful observer recently in touch with all classes and types in Germany is confident that the German proletariat as a whole would not tolerate Bolshevism under any conditions. The revelations of Herr Dittmann, the Independent Socialist, whose denunciations of the Bolshevik regime, largely founded upon the experiences of German workmen who had been despatched to Soviet Russia, have been appearing in &quot; Die Freiheit,&quot; have had a visible effect, especially as they have been backed up by a number of German workmen who have returned in the flesh. These articles and influences are being combated by agitation in Communist
circles and the distribution in Berlin factories of a resolution purporting to come from the remaining German emigrants in Russia which describes that country as a sort of paradise.According to Clara Zetkin the German Communist Party has given up all idea of immediate revolution and has fallen back upon the accumula-tion of arms and money for future action. Even before the debacle of the Soviet regime, now in progress, it became obvious that the situation in Germany was wholly unfavourable for action, and the most that could be hoped for was as alliance with Russia. Only in the quite unlikely eventuality of a repetition of something like the Kapp putsch would there be danger of an armed rising on the part of the Reds. rThe German Independent Socialist Party.The German Independent Socialist Party is on the eve of a serious split. It applied for admission to the Third International, but is still unrecognised by Moscow, and is charged by that body with failure to adhere to its programme. The Soviet has appealed to German workers to elect only delegates who are in favour of unconditional adhesion. It is believed that the moderate members of the Party will be driven to join the Majority Socialists, while those in favour of submitting to the Moscow conditions will go over to the German Communist Parties. Bukharin and Zinoviev have received permission from the German Government to &apos; attend the Conference which is shortly to be held to decide the question of the Party&apos;s adhesion to the.Third International. Meanwhile the Communist Party is devoting much energy to the extension and cou-solidation of its membership and to winning over as large a number of the Independent Socialists as possible.The Communist Party.The Communist Party, in fact, has increased tlje number of its groups from 14 to 52 in the last few months, deriving this accession to strength both from the ranks of the Communist Labour Party and of the Independent Socialist Party. The disavowal of both these parties by Moscow drives those who are convinced that union with Moscow is essential into the ranks of the Communist Party.Information has been received from a reliable source to the effect that the Communist Party is very short of money, in spite of the fact that it has recently received 25,000 francs from au unknown source. Formerly money was received from both Russia and Hungary, but Moscow now appears&apos;to be displeased with both the Communist Party and the Communist Labour Party, and the supply of funds has accordingly ceased. As a result both parties have caused members of their organisation to carry out armed robberies in various places. One of these gangs was recently caught in Spandau, and two have been caught in Berlin, In Communist circles it is thought that if the Government makes? use of these facts for propaganda purposes, a large body of workers will be frightened out of the Kampf Organisation, which was taken over by the Communist Labour Party some little time ago, and is in process of reorganisation.It is thought that the excuse that the robberies were committed against the Capitalists would carry little weight, since it is well known that not 50 per cent, of the proceeds of such robberies finds its way to the party funds.The Headquarters of the Western European Bureau are in Berlin, and branch offices have been created in Vienna and Amsterdam. The latter was dissolved some months ago because of its nationalist tendencies, but it has since been re-formed.   There are special branches in Geneva,
Alsace-Lorraine, Spain, England, and elsewhere, and an attempt has been made to restart the sub-branch in Paris, which was broken up some time ago by the French Authorities.The Berlin Bureau is said to be surrounded with Foreign Communist bodies. In this connection permanent English and American sections have been established which are affiliated to tho Communist Party.The Communist Labour Party.A split in the Communist Labour Party is already to some extent ai^ accomplished fact. Lauffenberg and WolfFheim, the Hamburg Communists, who were recently expelled from the Communist Labour Party, have founded a new party called &quot;Der Bund der Kommunisten,&quot; whose programme includes the organisation of revolutionary defence against the Imperialist powers of the League of Nations.The whole of the northern group of the Communist Labour Party, including Hamburg, Bremen, and Stettin, have declared themselves in favour of the Lauffenberg-Wolffheim policy of Communist nationalism and contact with the reactionaries of the Right. The position of the Communist Labour Party regarding the Third International is, * therefore, uncertain, but there is every prospect that when the split comes it will be to the profit of the Communist Party.SWITZERLAND.The Swiss Authorities veiw with considerable apprehension the effect upon their own Italian-speaking population of recent events in Italy, and believe that a large portion of the population of the Ticino will make trouble, which they fear that the recent recrudescence of Bolshevist propaganda is likely to reinforce.The Swiss Socialists are raising the question of the formation of a new International with a programe midway between that of the Second and Third. Fritz Platten, the Swiss Extremist, wrote to Caehin in France regarding &quot; this pernicious movement which was gradually gaining the sympathies of the proletarian masses.&quot; A conference was proposed between Platten, Cachin, and Daumig, but meanwhile the Swiss Government reincarcerated Platten in the prison of Andelfingen, Zurich, there to serve out the remainder of his sentence of six months&apos; imprisonment from which he had, for reasons of health, been allowed to remain in comparative liberty.AUSTRIA.Political.Mutual understanding was reported in September to exist between the reactionary parties of Hungary and Bavaria for the re-establishnient of an Austro-Hungarian State under Hapsburg rule. It was thought that the Christian Socialists and the Anarchists in Austria would support this movement, but in the event of the Christian Socialists being defeated at the elections it was proposed to extend the manoeuvres of the Hungarian army planned for this autumn on to Austrian territory and so force a decision. The success of the Christian Socialists would, on the other hand, be followed by the declaration of a Hungarian Monarchy simultaneously with the declaration of a &quot; Grossbayrische &quot; Monarchy, with the idea that, between the two, Austria would be included in the movement and the extended Bavarian - Austro - Hungarian State constituted.
The Soe;al Democrats have been pressing for a referendum to he taken throughout German Austria ou the question of union with Germany, a device to force the hands of the Christian Socialists, who would have to support the movement in their election campaign.Communist.There are further signs of activity on the part of the Communist Party of German-Austria founded in November, 1918, by the Radical Socialist, Steinhardt alias Gruber, and a woman named Friedlaeuder. The official organ of the Party is the daily paper &quot; Die Rote Fahne&quot; and its headquarters are located at Alserstrasse 691, Vienna, VIII. It appears that the necessary funds for these activities come from Moscow through Wigdor Kopp to Fasanenstrasse 29, and that the Viennesse Communists have already received 5.000,000 crowns in this way. Steps are being taken to extend propaganda to Slovakia and Italy and the tactics of the party will be discussed at two Congresses which will shortly be held, the first at Berlin and the second in Switzerland.The Communist Party, under the influence of Lenin, who steadily adheres to his recommendation that Parliamentary action should be used in order to demonstrate its inanity, decided by a large majority to rescind their decision to abstain from the forthcoming elections. Party agents got to work at once urging members of the party to register in time. The propagandist activities of Warsawski Bronski in Vienna are being tolerated by the Government partly from unwillingness to destroy the prospect of better relations with Russia, partly because they do not wish to prejudice the chances of their own representative, the propagandist Franz Walz, now in Moscow, negotiating for the repatriation of Austrian prisoners of Avar.Poale-Zion Movement.At an International Conference of the Poale-Zionist Party which was held at Vienna at the beginning of August a split occurred on the question of adherence to the 3rd International. The delegates from England. America, Palestine, and the Argentine were in favour of a more moderate policy.The rupture between the Left and Right Poale Zionist Delegates now appears to be complete, and the two sections, which have been renamed, are now acting independently.The Poale Zionists who have joined the Third International consist of Left Internationalists and the genuine Communists. Their intention to establish their head office in Vienna may meet with serious objection from the Austrian Police authorities.The right Poale Zionists have rejected the Second International and are only prepared to enter the Third International on their own conditions.HUNGARY.Hungarian Communists are reported to be actively propagating their doctriues in Central Europe. From their centre at Vienna, which is under the direction of one Kosoff, they communicate with all other Communist parties in Europe .and have established an especially strong connection with Jouhaux and the French Communists in Paris.Communication is reported to be by cipher messages carried in bottles of Odol.o  AS 8435 b
CZECHOSLOVAKIA.General.The Cijecho-Slovakian Government seems to be driven into a policy of extreme socialism and of close friendship for Soviet Russia by a veritable conspiracy of circumstances. The enmity of Hungary and the consequent diminution of French influence, the economic debility of Germany, the unrest within her own borders caused by the Czecho-Slovakian legionaries who have returned from Russia all bring Czecho-Slovakia within the sphere of Russian influences. In every sense Czecho-Slovakia forms the most obvious bridge from Russia to Central Europe.The State was described in September as in no position to offer resistance if trouble from the legionaries or Left Socialists arose. Though no immediate danger of a Red Terror was feared, confidence in the Government was being daily lost. Neutrality in the Russo-Polish conflict the Government in fact recognised as its only possible policy.On the 10th August the Government officially announced its intention of observing a policy of peace, neutrality and non-intervention in the conflict, a programme welcomed by the Social Democrats, whose policy is the establishment of diplomatic relations with Russia, and the refusal of help in the transit of war material to Poland, Hungary, or Roumania. The support of the Proletariat at the expense of the middle classes, and a benevolent neutrality towards Russia are incumbent upon a Government, members of whom are, indirectly at least, maintaining contact with Communist, circles.Great interest was talcen in the latter half of August in the attitude of British workmen towards the Polish-Russian war. Orderly demon-strations in favour of the speedy establishment of diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia were held in all large industrial centres. The motives for this policy, which coiucided with tendencies visible in Government circles, are the steady rise in the price of food and the unemployment, which is rife throughout the country.The Communists.On 14th September the official Czecho-Slovak Social Democratic Party was dissolved and three groups were formed : -(1) The Communist group under the leadership of Smeral, Skalkar, Hoiiser, Muna and Zapotocky, which adheres to the Third International.(2) The Central group composed of the more youthful elements under the leadership of Stevin,(3) The Right group under Nemec.The position of the Right Socialist Party is said to be stronger than that of the other two groups, in so far that it has a press, money, and is organised.The future policy of the Communist Party had been decided at a meeting of its own previous to that of the Social Democratic Party. The Communists resolved to form Workers&apos; Councils all over the country and proposed that 60 per cent, of labourers not engaged in Party work should be admitted to the Acting Committee. Dr., Smeral, who con-sidered that the time was not yet come for au absolute secession from the Social Democratic Party, was apparently over-ridden a few days later,
Russian and other Hostile Propaganda.Tlie propaganda of Bolshevism derives from two very different, and indeed, opposite sources. There is first of all Russian propaganda directed from Moscow. A Russian Red Cross Mission which arrived in Prague at the end of July, under the direction of a Dr. Gillerson, is reported as active in this direction, in defiance of the not very efficient or whole-hearted measures taken against it by the Government. Dr. Giller-son is reported to be acting as the Soviet agent in Czecho-Slovakia and has been in constant touch with Litvinoff whilst the latter was at Copen-hagen.   He has been specially active in anti-Czech propaganda.By similar means but for another end the Hungarians are also encouraging agitation in Czecho-Slovakia and using Bolshevist doctrines as a means to do so. Both the Austro-German Monarchist party, whose object is to break up the newly united Republic, and the Hungarian Christian Socialists and Communists, whose object is to retake Slovakia, encourage subversive movements of all kinds. The principal centres of their propaganda are at Bratislava and Komorn. Slovak peasants are being stirred up to retain their produce and generally to upset the economic balance of the country. The chief organisers in this agitation are Zatkovic, Felcan, and Karolyi. The first was arrested in August and deported, while Karolyi works from Vienna.Anti-Bolshevik League.A.&quot; White League &quot; has been formed in Czecho-Slovakia with a view to putting up a certain amount of resistance against Bolshevism. The existence of the League is kept as secret as possible, but it has large sums of money at its disposal. Among the chief supporters of the League are the Sokols, who are fairly well armed and are able to send reliable information regularly to Prague as to the situation in the various districts of Czecho-Slovakia.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.General.The present situation in Russia is described from a great diversity of sources of proved reliability to be bordering on the catastrophic. Prospects for the harvest are very poor. Even if the harvest of 1920 is collected in full it will not last the population beyond April 1921. The realisation of this, the adverse military situation, and growing discontent under Soviet rule, make it seem very possible that the disorders which started in Russia at the end of July and have been increasing in fre-quency ever since now constitute a serious menace to the Soviet power.The food question is, even at present, extremely acute, and the weekly ration in Petrograd. has been reduced to 1 lb. of groats, 1 lb. of apples, and ^ oz. of salt. The position of the masses is described as absolutely desperate. The population of 2\ millions in Petrograd is now reduced to 100,000 ; grass is growing in the principal streets, which are oozing sewage, owing to the break up of sewers. Moscow is very much overcrowded. Recent military defeats have brought the situation to a head, and revolts both of peasants and of workmen, and mutinies in the army itself have broken out everywhere. A brother-in-law of one of the leading commissars, who has just arrived in Reval, states that the Bolshevik Government is in a desperate situation and can see no way out, .b 2
Risings against the Soviet Government.In fact, inclicntious of the acute anxiety of the Soviet authorities about the internal situation are frequent. The Extraordinary Connnis-sion has been correspondingly active, and has resorted to severe repressive measures at the slightest sign of a rising. Eor some time past the Government has been carrying ou Avhat can only be called a policy of pogroms against the social revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, and the Chresvychaika has had orders to proceed ruthlessly against them.The leader of the Left Social Revolutionaries, KamkofF Krasnoff, and the divorced Avife of Tchernoff, were arrested early in September on charges of organising riots throughout Russia and especially in govern-meuts suffering acutely from the bad harvest, that is, the governments of Tamboff, Toula, Koursk, Riazan. Simbirsk, and Twer. In Twer the Social Revolutionaries succeeded in winning over the garrison. The Bolshevik Commissar of the Government Avas killed and all the members of the Chresvychaika Avere shot. In the Government of Tamboff peasants went out with scythes to meet the requisitioning party. Mensheviks organised similar results in part of the Donetz basin at Yousovka and Makeivka, so that Petrovski, a member of the Soviet Government of the Ukraine, Avas despatched with considerable force to suppress them. In 30 governments a state of siege Avas proclaimed. Countless peasants and Avorkers are reported to have been shot, and the concentration camps are hoav crammed with proletarians.Lunacharski, the Bolshevik Commissar for Education, who has just returned from the Ukraine, is reported to have described that region as in a complete state of anarchy and the Kuban district as openly insubordinate to the Soviet Government.The unsatisfactory military situation and new mobilisatious have also been causing risings. The fresh mobilisations taking place throughout the whole of Soviet Russia have resulted in men up to the age of 48 being called up for military duties in the rear of the army and in the forced mobilisation of all women already serving in military and supply depart-ments. Former officers occupying posts in the rear, and even those totally exempted from military duties on medical grounds, are being re-examined through the intermediary of extraordinary commissions. The severities resulting from the mobilisation have added to the general discontent. Insurgents in the area of Moscow are reported to have torn up the railway lines leading to the city, and to have deposited them at some considerable distance from the railway embankment, so impeding the movements of troops and making it very difficult for the authorities to quell the revolts.The Army.Meanwhile the army has been retiring upon all fronts a movement caused not only by the attacks of the enemy, but also by the inadequacy in the supply of provisions and equipment due to general disorganisation.A Russian general Avho served in the north and since commanded one of the armies against Poland states that under no circumstances can he keep his men together much longer, certainly not beyond the spring ; the position is not so much.one of any section of the Red Army revolting against the Communists as of a certainty that the men will drift back to their villages, especially Avhen the cold Aveather comes. At present they are under-fed and under-clothed, destitute of overcoats, and living largely on, salt fish..A special deputation from the Polish front recently arrived in Moscow, demanding arms and equipment, and threatening unless they got
tliem to go homo and leave tho front to its fate.. Communists at the front had been put under arrest and declared hostages to ensure the safety of the deputation.The Moscow Communists in the face of this disaster appear to be appealing ever more desperately for foreign aid. Serrati is reported at the beginning of September, in a letter to the Italian Socialists, to have stated that the French ex-Captain Sadoul had taken over command of an &quot; International Legion.&quot; then in course of formation in Moscow and already 15,000 strong, Serrati appealed for capable officers and non-commissioned officers for that army. Three to four thousand foreign officers would &quot;raise the moral of the Soviet army by giving it the impression that the proletariat of the world was already on its side.&quot; Simple Russian soldiers, he said, did not believe in the sincerity of the German officers now on duty with the armies.In view of the difficulties of the situation the Soviet Government resolved to summon a meeting at Moscow on 22ud September of all representatives of active Communism, including foreign Communists who had arrived to participate in tho Third International, to decide on the immediate future policy of the Government. It was reported that the higher military command might even go so far as to propose that military activities be stopped and a new programme of future activities of the Soviet Government drawn up. The relation of Soviet Russia to foreign powers, the questions of winter supplies, of the reorganisation of transport, and of Communist propaganda abroad were to be discussed. It is even said that the meeting decided on the suppression of several important political persons abroad hostile to the Bolshevik policy.These are the measures of the unnerved. And, in fact, reliable informants state that the Commissaries are now very frightened, and that, should their fear increase, one by one they will disappear, taking with them all the loot they can lay their hands on ; and that as soon as it becomes known that they are gone, persons will come to the front who dare not now declare themselves. One well-informed correspondent even states that the only reason why the Communists still continue in power is that the Kremlin is held by Lettish and Chinese soldiers.George Lomonosoff, a moderate Bolshevik and a close friend of Krassin&apos;s, is also reported to be of opinion that the debolshevising of Russia is nearer achievement than is generally supposed, and that after a settlement of the Polish question a new government of financial and business experts, which could reorganise Russia, might not be unattainable.General Wrangel and the Situation in South Russia.A reliable informant at Sebastopol describes Wrangel as a clever and versatile general, fighting in a country and with a people thoroughly known to him. His personal magnetism and his popularity with civilians and military alike enable him to do much which would not otherwise be accepted. Skatiloff, his Chief of Staff, is a remarkable and brilliant man of 38. Together they make a purposeful pair, who give inefficiency short shrift.Wrangel has many difficulties to contend with, especially in the economic sphere. It is by now a commonplace that he succeeded, where Denikin failed, in obtaining the co-operation of the peasants. He has made them owners of their farms on condition that they cede 20 per cent, of the harvest to the State, and the peasantry have fallen in with the arrangements and have been working land which has not been properly tilled since 1914, and which has, in addition, had to suffer the blight of a Bolshevik invasion.   As a result of this policy it has been
possible to export from the Crimea to France (with which, through the Russian representative in Paris, a monopoly in Crimean produce lias been arranged) nearly 20 million poods of barley, &amp;c, and a good deal of excellent wine and other produce. This, despite the difficulties of transport, inland and by ivatcr, and the general disorganisation of the public services, which, always bad, have not been improved by the inevitable corruption of au underpaid legion of minor officials, whose salaries cannot be effectively raised because the, rouble is valueless.The economic position, indeed, is WrangeFs most urgent trouble. There are plenty of roubles Romanoff, Kerensky, Don, &amp;c. but people can btiy nothing with them because of the dearth of manufactured articles. Everybody is trying to convert roubles into foreign money or such articles. Since both are lacking, the depression of the rouble continues. At the present moment the rouble stands at 100,000 to the   in Sebastopol.- In the territory occupied by Wrangel the ordinary revenue from taxes and customs is 22 milliards, and the ordinary expenditure is 14 milliards, but this takes no account of the army and of warlike operations, which are now costing at the rate of 240 milliards per annum.For the moment Wrangel himself regards public health as the most urgent question. He has in the Crimea 2,000,000 underfed and exhausted civilians, of whom a great proportion are refugees, with their women and children. Naturally none too cleau, they have been overcrowded for two years or more. It is probable that during the winter the ravages of typhus among these refugees will be terrible. Wrangel has made an exhaustive inquiry and calculates that there must be at least 100,000 cases among civilians by the end of the year. The infection of the army would have military consequences of the gravest nature. There is urgent need, therefore, both on the grounds of humanity and of policy, that Wrangel should, within the next few weeks, obtain stores of carbolic acid, sulphur, formalin, disinfecting apparatus, and hospital linen, as well as some 200 civilian doctors, the total outlay being calculated at 400,000/. a figure not unreasonable when it is considered that the League of Nations estimates the needs of Poland and Galicia at 2,000,000/.General Wrangefs Minister of Finance considers that only a foreign credit can save the financial situation, and has approached foreigners with a proposal for a loan, fixing the rouble indifferently at a thousand or a hundred to the  , and endeavouring to stabilise its value by the issue of a uniform series of notes for which all notes at present held would have to be exchanged, the loan to be guaranteed by the making over of the customs rights, the payment of annual interest ou the revenue of the State, the right of exploitation of certain State domains, and a guarantee that when civil war is ended in Russia certain concessions will be allotted in various parts of the territory.The Influence o  the Third International Abroad.The influence of the Third International abroad has during the past month operated mainly towards a severance of the extreme communist elements in all countries from moderate Socialists and even from Com-munists who were willing to accept the Third International on their own terms. The inherent contradiction of this attitude, which is that of Mr. Lansbury in this country and of the Socialist Labour party in Finland, of certain of the German Independent Socialists, and, in fact, of a certain class of Communist of all countries, has been more than once
pointed out in this Review. Lenin has never swerved from the opinion that those who do not accept in its entirety the programme of the Third International, including the arming of the proletariat during the period of transition between the destruction of capitalism and the full acceptance everywhere of the Communist theory of Government, are at heart still bourgeois, mere waverers, untrustworthy, and therefore to be treated as the enemy. His own public enunciations of policy have throughout been on these lines, but the acceptance of this policy by the Second Congress of the Third International and its official distribution to Communist groups throughout the world, with Lenin1s 21 points, have brought the discussion to a head in every country.The splitting, more or less grave, of all the present Communist parties and the rejection by the Moscow Congress of &quot; moderatism,&quot; even in its extremist forms, is now resulting in a clean severance and an absolute opposition between adherents to the Third International and the rest of the world, Capitalist, Moderate Socialist, Social Democratic, Independent Socialist, and even Pacifist Communists. The Congress at Moscow has, in fact, proclaimed that every shade of pink, short of the absolute scarlet, is white, and shall be treated as such, and that&apos; negotiation regarding principles is impossible with all bodies not of its own colour. Apart, therefore, from opportunist individualists, of whom the Third International is exempt no more than other human organisations, it may now be said that genuine Socialist opinion everywhere has been officially summoned to decide with which party it will stand, and the militancy of Lenin is proclaimed the creed of the Third International as a whole.It is unlikely, of course, that Communists of the type of Mr. Lausbury, of the moderate Left Wing of the German Independents, or of the Finnish Socialist Labour Party will accept the decision. They will continue to look to Moscow as their spiritual home, even though she rejects them ; they will also continue to receive money and encourage-menii; intrigue will continue to bridge the gulf, and efforts for their conversion to the true faith will not be wanting. But, none the less, the gulf is now fixed and has been made visible to all. Forces on both sides will be drawn up in battle array. It has been Leniu&apos;s deliberate policy that the severance should be a clean one. In his carelessness as to method and his acceptance of a generation, if need be, of universal civil wars he relies solely upon the force of his idea, which he believes to be irresistible.The Trade Delegation and Propaganda in the United Kingdom.A curious instance of the Bolshevik tendency to make what is in truth duplicity appear to square with actual fact was Tcbitcherin&apos;s denial that the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs had anything to do with or any knowledge of the 75,000/. offered to the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; Officially and literally this was true, though in fact it was false. All propaganda in England is directed, financed, and carried out in the name of the Third International by secret and illegal means. The Soviet Government could thus always argue that contracts and agreements not to engage in Bol-shevik propaganda given by members of the Bolshevik Delegation have been carried out, as members of the Bolshevik Delegation have no official connection with the Third International.Rosowsky, a member of the Delegation, has described the success of his revolutionary propaganda as passing all expectation. By placing sums of money in English banks the necessary subsidies to French, Spanish, and Italian revolutionaries are facilitated. Commercial travellers going backwards and forwards between France and England have been recruited as couriers, and it is believed that a regular service is main-tained.
Rosowsky is reported to have told Litvinoff that the Krassin Mission had distributed enormous sums of money for revolutionary propaganda in England, and was in close connection with the new English Communist Party.M. Riazanof, who in the latter half of September joined M, Krassiu&apos;s Trade Delegation in London, was for a time erroneously reported to have come as the successor to M. Kameneff; he really inherited none of M. kamenoffs semi-diplomatic functions, and joined the Delegation merely as au additional expert on M. Krassin&apos;s staff. He is a Social Democrat of the Left who has thrown in his lot with the Bolsheviks, and his real name is Goldendach. His purpose, apart from trade, is reported to be to help Krassin in moderate Trade Union circles, and it is pro-posed to use him to influence the Right Wing of the syndicalist and professional elements. He is described by those who know him as a man of no great standing or attainments ; a Jew of the coarser type ; in his early days a dubious student of medicine in Paris.How English conditions are reported in Russia may be gathered from a recent violent speech by Nogin, lately a, member of the Russian Delegation in London. Nogin, speaking in Russia, described the economic condition of England and Western Europe as bad in the extreme, and as 300 years behind that of Russia.Economic Conditions.Lenin is reported to have announced in the latter half of September that he intended to nationalise all Russian factories and works, and to entrust the management to British or American control, the present owners receiving a salary in subordinate positions. The position regarding locomotives is most serious. The two methods hitherto employed of keeping up the rate of output have been, first, redistribution-bution of stocks in hand at the expense of other Government departments; second, the &quot; divesting &quot; of dead locomotives. Both these sources have now run dry, and all engines requiring ordinary repairs having been exhausted, the railways have to fall back upon locomotives already-&quot;divested,&quot; which require complete reconstructive repairs, for which both time and material are wanting.All hopes of obtaining foodstuffs from Russia are being gradually dissipated. The Italians, eager to be the first in the field in obtaining supplies from Soviet Russia, arranged for the export, through the Black Sea to Italy, of considerable quantities of grain. Only a third part of the grain actually promised was shipped to them, and that third part, on arrival at Naples in August, was found to be so mouldy as to be useless. Its condition would seem to confirm the reports more than once quoted in this Review, that grain requisitioned by the Bolshevik authorities from the peasantry has often been dug out of hiding places in the woods, where the peasants have stored it in the hope that it would escape notice.In the latter half of August, Boukhanoff, acting Peopled Commissary for Foodstuffs, speaking at a meeting of the Moscow Soviet, estimated the requirements of Russia at 400 million poods of flour, and the production this year at 380 million poods. His only remedies for the shortage were the now quite unattainable ones of increased work, the destruction of the Wrangel menace, and the mobilisation of workmen. Owing to the shortage of labour, of supplies for workmen, and of implements the &quot; Economistishe Jizn&quot; reports that only 69 per cent, of the estimated requirements of firewood could be obtained ; of the require-ments in pig iron, amounting to 4,561,000 poods, only 50 per cent, is available.   The newspaper attributes these shortages to the lack of fuel;
it also announces the approach of a crisis in forage to combat which a commission has been formed whoso duty it is to organise the collection of substitutes, including *&apos; tree hay,&quot; Le., the leaves of trees. It. has to collect four to five veuiki, Le., bundles of not less than 10 pounds in weight of 10 to 12 branches tied together. The largest amount to be collected by any one province is 600,000 of these bundles.FINLAND.The Socialist Labour Party.The Left Wing of the Social Democratic Party which, a few months since, decided to join the 3rd International, has found that such affiilia-tion is a contradiction in terms and an impossibility. It is understood that the new Socialist Labour Party has now decided not to join the Third International if the latter body insists upon making the arming of the proletariat or the maintenance of secret armed organisations a condition of affiliation. Delegates of the Socialist Labour Party who were arrested by the Authorities when that body pronounced in favour of the 3rd International have now been released under an order of the High Court of Abo.The Finnish Communists at Petrograd, who have been egging on their comrades in Finland to energetic forms of action, in the danger of which they do not participate, have incurred reprisals ou the part of those comrades themselves. It is reported that a body of armed Finns recently entered the meeting of the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party in Petrograd, murdered nine of the members, and wounded seven others. The assailants were disarmed and arrested. Though Moscow reported the incident as the outcome of a White plot, there appears to be no doubt that it was really the result of friction between the two bodies of Finnish Reds. If so, it is unlikely that concord between the two sections will be restored for some time to come.German influences are reported to be at work upon all political groups in Finland. Even the Social Democrats and Finnish Socialists are being invited to model themselves upon their corresponding parties in Germany rather than in Great Britain.Baltic States.The policy of the Bolshevik Government towards the Baltic States is dictated by the necessity for Russia to command the seaboard of the Baltic as a channel of communication with Western Europe.. Of necessity it.is a policy fundamentally aggressive, though means of giving effect to it may be refined or brutal as circumstances require. At present Soviet policy is directed to lulling the suspicions of the small States by a willingness to negotiate Avith them and to make, on paper, all concessions. The smaller Avestcrn States have been approached first, in order that the others may be convinced of Bolshevik good faith.Behind these assurances, however, lies the profound intention on the part of the Soviet Government by all means to destroy the idea of a military union of the Border States. The agent of the Central Com-mittee of Stockholm in Riga states that the Soviet Government has spent more than 1,500,000 roubles in bribes to effect this disunion.The attitude to Russia of all these States Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania depends largely upon British policy. A Russo-British agreement virtually lays them at the mercy of Soviet Russia, whose
ESTHONIA.The financial situation is said to be going from bad to worse, and State bankrupicy is regarded as imminent. The &apos; output of grain has been reduced by 30 or 40 per cent., a reduction which brings the country face to face with starvation during the coming winter.For this reduction the laws sanctioning the expropriation of land recently passed by the Social Democrat Party appear to be in some measure responsible. The agrarian law does not appear to have satisfied the peasants more than it did the landowners. The landowners regard the compensation as insufficient, while the peasants, who have been elevated into a class of small-owners, complain of the Governments inability to provide them with the necessary equipment to run their farms. The net result will be a dead loss to the prestige of the Social Democrat Party.Bolshevik agitation meanwhile is reported to be on the increase, and three Communist printing presses were discovered at Reval towards the end of August. This propaganda will not, it is believed, have much effect upon the peasants, while Franco-British policy is reported to have completely upset the plans of the Soviet Government in Esthonia and to have greatly nonplussed M. Sogniers, the head of the Propaganda Section of the Reval Delegation. The hardening of British policy has also led to a firin stand against Bolshevik influences on the part of the Government, who, early in September, returned to Russia 61 Bolshevik agitators who had been active, under instructions from Moscow, in the recent strikes.LATVIA.Latvian firmness against Russian incursions is well maintained. A number of prominent Communists were arrested in Lettonia towards the middle of September, when the Poles also seized a quantity of literature, false seals, and a copy of accounts, showiug that the men arrested had been in receipt of funds from Russia.The Germans are endeavouring to capture trade and to embarrass the commercial relations between Latvia and French firms.influences they would no longer be able to withstand and whose Com-communism they would eventually, whether by gentle or more drastic means, be obliged to emulate. On the other hand, a definite break with Soviet Russia on the part of Great Britain would call forth active aggression against the Border States on the part of the Bolsheviks, if active aggression were still in their power. In such a case Finland, it is thought, would be the first (o he attacked, since a blow at her would terrorise the smaller States into a readiness for peace at any price. If the order of attack were reversed and the lesser States were taken first, Finland would intervene and the Bolsheviks would be faced with the situation which they are so anxious to avoid of a Bolshevik union opposed to them, with fighting upon two fronts. United and simul-taneous action on the part of all States at the first symptoms of aggressive action on the part of the Bolsheviks would appear to be the only way of forestalling the policy of frightfuluess which the Bolsheviks are inclined, and may even yet remain strong enough, to employ.
LITHUANIA.Axelrod was appointed the Soviet representative at Kovno early in September with instructions to transform Lithuania into an economic and political bridge between Germany and Russia, and to arm the Lithuanian working classes against the Poles with weapons from Germany. He is reported to have set to work with extreme caution and to have acquitted himself so well of his task that the Soviet Government have thoughts of appointing him as LitvinotTs successor in Copenhagen. His position must have been made more difficult, however, and his work endangered, by the recent Polish incursions and the. reported Polish diplomatic successes in White Russia.POLAND.Bolshevik excesses during the occupation of Poland, combined with &quot;the overwhelming Polish successes, have had the natural effect of heightening Polish national ambitions. Polish policy would appear to be directed to an accentuation of their outlet to the Baltic, necessarily at the expense of Lithuania. The occupation of Vilna and the insistence in the peace negotiations at Riga upon an outlet via, the Dvina is reliably reported to be supplemented by intrigues for the establishment of a White Russian Republic in Minsk, which would protect the outlet ou the Russian side.Despite official denials at Wrsaaw, Polish troops were said, on October 11th, to lie already in occupation of Minsk. It was said that the coup tfelat, then believed to be immiuent, had been engineered with the connivance of the White Russian delegates attending the Russo-Polish Peace conference at Riga.The late crisis seems to prove that the Polish Communist Party and Bolshevism in Poland are weaker than was generally supposed. Polish workmen, who are Socialists or Nationalists, declare themselves, when the moment arrives for their co-operation with the advancing Reds, as uncompromisingly opposed to Bolshevist doctrines. The behaviour of the Bolshevik commissars when they look over the factories at Bialystok proved to the workmen that Bolshevism was hardly the paradise of their expectations and the pillage and robbery of the Country at large roused ,the peasantry against them.The Polish representatives in Berlin were reported late in August to be continuing their efforts towards a rapprochement with Germany. A Polish propaganda society with branches in London, Paris, Vienna, and Berlin was formed under the presidency of Ledislaus von Baronowski and is apparently a sort of off-shoot with strong activist tendencies of the regular Polish Diplomatic Service. It is possible that from these efforts some rapprochement with Germany may result, but a division of policy in this regard appears to exist among the representatives of Poland abroad, and the Polish Consul-General in Zurich is reported actively to favour au alliance directed against Prussia on the part of Poland, France, and Bavaria.THE UKRAINE.The Moscow Government has consented with great reluctance to recognise an independent, allied, but not federated, Ukranian Republic, within national boundaries, and having an army and separate command of its own. The negotiations at Moscow were conducted on the Ukriauian side by Vinnitchenko, the Ukrainian leader recently converted to Bolshevism.
Pending recognition by one or other of the allied powers, Pethira has formed an offensive and defensive alliance with the Don Cossacks.The Ukrainian army, ill-equipped as it is, is reported to have borne its part well on the southern front. There is considerable suspicion among Ukrainians, however, of General Wrangel, whom they credit with intentions to reconstitute Russia within her former territories and to oblige them to submit to her under a Monarchist regime.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.BULGARIA.M. Stainbolisky is, at long last, carrying out the policy which has been advocated by Viscount Bryce, Mr. J. 1). Bourchier, and others since the early years of this century, the policy, namely, of dependence upon the western powers. He is reported to have great hopes during his visit to England of concluding financial arrangements which will give Great Britain a profound interest in the future of his country. In his own party M. Stambolisky is reported to have lost considerable popularity on account of the severity of his socialistic measures ; one of these gives power to local authorities to expropriate big houses, and especially village cabarets, and turn them into public buildings, schools, &amp;c. This has led to proprietors pulling their houses down and selling the material.JUGO-SLAVIA.British and American commercial prestige is reported as high in Jugo-Slavia, the wealth of whose agricultural products and still unde-developed natural resources make it an important market. Other countries have been attempting to obtain concessions, but there appears to be a distinct preference for dealing with Americans and English ; with Americans on account of the American attitude on the Adriatic question, and with the British because association with them during the war has impressed Serbians with the reliability of individual Britishers. This quality is not, however, ascribed to the British Government, which is still regarded by tho uninformed as a robber and despoiler of weaker nations.ROUMANIA.French policy in Roumania was reported early in September to be directed towards the creation of an understanding between that country and Hungary, at the expense of Czecho-Slovakia, and in opposition to the &quot; little entente&quot; between Czecho-Slovakia, Jugo-Slavia, and roumania. It is understood that Take Jonescu, the ententophil of former days, is anxious, in his fear of the Russians, to draw the bonds between Hungary and his own country closer.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES..   TURKEY. The Government and the Nationalists.&apos; The popularity of the Government among the educated classes is said to be on the wane.There is a growing feeling among supporters of the Government and the more moderate anti-Nationalists that a modus vivendi must be arrived
at with the Moderate Nationalists if chaos and anarchy at Constantinople are to be prevented. With the majority of the educated Turks who have relatives amongst the Nationalists the Grand Vizier&apos;s policy of war to the knife is reported to be unpopular.The Nationalists.The military situation of the Nationalists in Anatolia was reported early in September to be desperate. Funds and arms were wanting, and what equipment there was was worn out. They themselves felt that safety was only to be looked for in Russia. It was reported, however, that mere subsidising by the Soviet Government would not meet the case, as it would not touch the question of man-power.A proclamation issued by Mustapha Kemal late in August mentions a Turco-Riisso-German Holy Alliance, of which nothing had before been heard. It is addressed to Moslems of all countries and speaks of the two great nations to whom the Turkish Nationalists have allied themselves as supporting and helping them in the defence of Islam, and further institutes a sort of feudal conscription throughout Anatolia, each 40 families being bound to supply and equip one soldier and pay him  T30 monthly.At the secret meeting in August of the National Assembly at Angora a letter, believed to emanate from Mohamed Ali, President of the Indian Khaliphat Delegation in Europe, was discussed. It spoke of the disastrous peace signed by the Turkish Government under coercion, and announced that the time was ripe for representatives of the Mussulman world to take final measures for the consolidation and deliverance of Islam. The programme of general strikes proposed recalls the non-co-operation movement led by Gandhi in India.Italy continues to be the centre of Nationalist intrigues. It is reported that, at a meeting on 3rd August near Lucerne, Talaat Pasha described the union between the Nationalists and the Committee of Union and Progress as complete in its repudiation of the Peace signed by the English Government. Aided by Russia they would fight until England gave way.   Lloyd George was their only real enemy.It is confirmed that Italian Consulates in Switzerland are used as a channel for Nationalist and revolutionary communications. The Italian Consulate at Lucerne is reported to be the end of the channel established between Switzerland and Angora. The Italian Consul-General in Switzerland, Conimeudatore Guido dc Lucchi, is reported as noticeably anti-British. One of his Vice-Consuls, named Guisi, has been highly commended by Ilesbad Bey, who engages in gun-running in Switzerland on behalf of the Turkish Nationalists. It is believed that Commendatore de Lucchi is not unaware of what goes on.Enver Pasha.Enver Pasha was reported in September to be organising and training a considerable army of Turks and Tartars in Eastern Turkestan for the invasion of India. He had previously returned from Moscow with iiri-portant messages from Lenin. The idea then was that as soon as Poland was crushed the march ou India would commence, Enver Pasha being appointed to the command of the troops during the new operations. Local intrigues in Persia to win over to the Russian side the more important of the neutral troops was included in Enver&apos;s programme, and it was reported that the services of Das Gupta, the notorious Indian Seditiouist, who is well known to all the Turkish leaders, would be fully employed.
PERSIA.Persia and countries harbouring Persians are reported to be nests of anti-British intrigue.With the re-capture of Resht in July by the Persian Cossacks, the Bolsheviks, it is true, lost au important centre of distribution of Communist literature and propaganda. But a considerable growth of anti-British sentiment was reported towards the end of the same month. The resignation of the late Cabinet, while apparently a matter of necessity, was reported in reality to be only a manoeuvre to gain greater freedom for anti-British intrigue. The Persian Cabinet was in reality in complete sympathy with Kuchuk Khan, and afforded him assistance in secret.At Batouin the Persian Consulate is described as a centre of Bolshevism, and a certain Major Roshany Bey, thought to be identical with a well-kuown Caucasian cut-throat, was acting as courier Avith this centre and engaged in Bolshevik and Turkish intrigue there.Early in September a conference, largely consisting of Persians, is reported to have taken place at Enver Pasha&apos;s house in Berlin. At this conference Enver stated that should Persian Nationalists by a revolution set up a government independent of British influence, Soviet Russia would respect and guarantee Persian independence under a government not necessarily Bolshevik in form, but intransigent in its hostility to British influence. Enver gave a parallel assurance on behalf of Turkey. Funds Avere to be supplied through him from Soviet Russia.It Avas understood in September that M. Bravin would shortly arrive at Teheran as the Soviet representative.EGYPT.Egyptians in Switzerland received the announcement of the Anglo-Egyptian agreement with mixed feelings, Anglophiles and Extremists condemning it for opposite reasons. The agreement has, hoAvever, obtained the approval of the Moderate majority. The Extremists, seeing their power passing away, are taking steps to stir up dissatisfaction while they may. Anglophiles fear that independence entails for them at least retirement from public life, and possibly exile. They also fear a period of persecution should the Extremists as a last resort determine to seize poAver. The effort of the Moderates, meainvhile, is all for consolidation and the smoothing out of internal dissensions. The Moderate position is that, as the Egyptiau movement was entirely national and non-religious, Pan-Islamism did not enter into the question. The Right Moderates, who Avanted merely minor concessions, but did not think Egypt sufficiently advanced for Home Rule,.are embarrassed by ZaghlouFs success. .\Curiously enough the prospect of independence has raised the colour question. The difference betAveen the Extremists, many of whom are of a negroid type, and the fairer-skinned Moderates appears to have raised the sentiment of colour among the latter.Italy is beginning to regret her encouragement of anti-British movements, which, although they Avere to her interest as long as they Avere merely subversive and anti-British, are not so much so when they result in concessions. Italians do not believe that England would ever grant so full a measure of independence to Egypt, and are noAV in considerable anxiety about a possible claim for independence from Tripoli, which they aver British intrigue will be sure to encourage.
In Cairo there has been much talk as to whether Zaghloul&apos;s seven delegates will be able to persuade the Nationalists in Egypt to accept the Miluer agreement. The native press appears to be equally divided on the question.The cotton crop, which has been destroyed by worm, is causing anxiety, and the rising of the Nile has been premature.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.THE CAUCASUS.Hostility to Bolshevism was reported to be growing throughout the Caucasus, where the Bolsheviks have been showing extreme nervousness at the increased difficulty which they find in dealing with tribal outbreaks.Pan-Islaniism was reported as making small progress, and Moslem feeling is taking on a more and more national form against the Bolsheviks, though coherent effort in this resistance was reported to be lacking.Lithe Azerbaijan Republic, conditions, economic and political, have not been upset so much as in Soviet Russia. Local factories have been nationalised, but the technical personnel was from the first retained.Though the cost of living had greatly increased there was reported to be plenty of food, which there was no tendency either to export or to requisition. The Bolsheviks have been active in their Oriental pro-paganda, which, since it is directed against Great Britain, they appear to have thought would be considerably furthered by the encouragement of persons supposed to be representative of British Labour. Tom Quelch, then of the British Socialist Party, now merged in the Communist Party of Great Britain, attended the Congress of Orientals which opened iD Baku in September under the presidency of Zinoviev, and a proclamation in the usual strain issued by the Third International to the peoples of Persia, Armenia, and Turkey was signed by Tom Quelch, W. McLaiue, J. T. Murphy, and Jack Tanner on behalf of their organisations in Great Britain.Towards the end of September, Kirghiz was announced by wireless as having established an autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic.GEORGIA.The internal situation appears to be more or less stable. Public opinion was considerably influenced by the success of (he Poles against the Red Army, and the Government announced, with uncertain assurance, that it feared no attempt to establish Bolshevism.AFGHANISTAN.Jeinal Pasha arrived in Afghanistan early in September for the purpose of organising the army.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. CHINA.The Chinese Government has waived its objections to negotiate officially for the resumption of relations with Soviet Russia, but requires guarantees that no Bolshevik propaganda be undertaken in China.The President of the Russian Mission to the Far East was warmly greeted at Pekin.
SIBERIA.It was reported in July that the economic position in Siberia largely resembles that in European Russia, the powers of the Soviet authorities not extending in effect far beyond the zone on either side of the railway. Within that zone the peasants were subjected to the usual requisitionings . and ill-treatment by the troops, and their produce, which they were told was destined for England and America, was all being taken into European Russia. Under these conditions no surplus grain was available for export, and the only articles so available were hides and skins to the amount of 10,000 tons. The frequent peasant revolts were reported to be mercilessly repressed.The Japanese are adopting a conciliatory policy towards the popula-tion and Government, and have withdrawn their support from Semenoff. The subject of Kamschatka is not unlikely to cause friction between Japan on the one hand and America and the Soviet Government on the other. Both Japan and America are reported to have designs upon Kamschatka, and America is understood to be desirous of creating friction in order to frustrate Japanese schemes. In this connection attention is drawn to the article regarding negotiations now being conducted at Moscow by Mr. Washington Baker Vanderlip, which appears in Part II. of this issue.9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.General Conditions.The labour situation throughout Canada is said to be easier, as a result of the facility with which strikers are replaced by non-union men. Indeed, in Regina International Unionism is said to be losing ground, as non-union men receive just as much pay and work as well as the union men.An excellent report has been received regarding labour conditions on the construction work of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway ; the supply of labour is good, wages high, there are no agitators, and friendly relations exist between officials and men.In other places, too, the influence of the extremists appears to be waning ; all resolutions expressing sympathy with Bolshevism or One Big Union were overwhelmingly defeated at the Dominion Trades Labourv Congress in Toronto. Two resolutions on the Irish question were also defeated.On the other hand, the Central Branch of the Independent Labour Party of Hamilton, Ontario, draws a gloomy picture of conditions in Canada, and warns would-be emigrants that work is scarce, cost of living high, and housing conditions wretched.Although the strike amongst the Lake sailors is spreading to a number of the larger freighters and passenger boats on the Great Lakes, the Lake traffic is continuing without serious interruption, and every effort is being made to carry the Western grain crop to the seaboard before the close of navigation.A well-known agitator, Midgley, speaking of conditions in Canada, stated that there was no real misery and no food troubles, owing to the big surplus production. People could never be prevailed upon to make a general movement especially as excellent relations exist between the large majority of labour and the employers. Extremists mostly belong to the common lumbering and labourer class from the United States,
whose feelings have been embittered by the treatment they have received. He anticipates serious trouble in the United States, and advised the Canadians to watch the international border line very sharply. He, himself, expects to be superseded by the I.W.W. at the coming One Big Union Convention, as he has opposed their policy of national organisation and upheld local industrial organisation.Three parties have ariseu in the One Big Union which may con-conceivably split the organisation at the forthcoming Convention at Port Arthur. Urged partly by personal rivalries, one party champions a &quot; Geographical,&quot; another an &quot; Industrial,&quot; and the third a &quot; Class &quot; type of organisation. The miners and transport workers favour the &quot; Geographical,&quot; the lumberers (L.W.I.U.) advocate the &quot; Industrial,&quot; while the &quot; Class &quot; form, where all workers could be united, irrespective of race, creed, or colour, with power to act when opportunity offered, finds much support in Winnipeg. Should the breach widen there is every possibility that the One Big Union may come to an untimely end.In view of the approaching Convention, the General Workers Unit, One Big Union, of Vancouver has appointed a Committee to draw up tentative proposals for the establishment of a General Fund scheme as opposed to the &quot; Per Capita &quot; system of finance. An article has appeared in the &quot;British ColumbiaFederationist&quot; denouncing the Per Capita tax as a &quot; pernicious characteristic of craft unionism,&quot; and advocating owner-ship of all union funds by the union as a whole.A number of foreign-born One Big Union men have left the Bienfait Mines as a result of a strike ; a few who seceded from the One Big Union were taken back. The Company refused to take back the leader, Diaczum, but was disposed to reinstate the One Big Union men if they would undertake to cause no more trouble before May next. Before doing so the Company consulted the men who had refused to strike, and fouud that these men, practically all of whom were English-speaking, objected strongly to men who remained One Big Union being taken back :- &quot; Several of them told Mr. Sutherland that the One Big Union was the first footing of Bolshevism, and it would be a good thing for Taylorton and all Canada to get rid of them, and that every white man refused to go to work if they were allowed back. They told Mr. Sutherland that the One Big Union was agitating a rebellion, and they were not going to work with any One Big Union men.&quot;Extremists.A change of policy is reported among the Lumber Workers&apos; Industrial Union to (1) more sabotage, (2) fewer strikes, and (3) more energetic support of such strikes as are called. Curtailment of production is also strongly advocated.Agitators evidently employed by some organisation of means are busily spreading Bolshevist propaganda in lumber camps, on the railways, &amp;c. They have been active in urging &quot; job action &quot; in preference to strikes. In one case, strikers accepted the company&apos;s offer, but returned to work in an ugly temper, bent upon sabotage should an opportunity arise. Agitators are chiefly successful among the foreign shantymen, of whom there are 350,000 in the Dominion. Efforts to counteract this propaganda are being made by the Shantymen&apos;s Christian Association.The Winnipeg Running Trades Unit O.B.U. has decided to turn the Unit into a secret organisation, so that it may enroll members of the International, who, as such, are forbidden to join any other labour organisation.0 AS 8435 C
The Ontario Labour College is described as the meeting placo of the I.W.W. Communists and other Radicals, and an organising point for revolutionary matters.   The members are of different nationalities.It is said that the I.W.W. is once more being established in Van-couver, and the possibility is that it may become more dangerous to the operators than the One Big Union.The Soviet organisation in New York continues to exercise direct influence in Montreal, and two agitators, Michael Buhay and F. W. Gerrish, have called for the formation of a &quot; Committee of Action,&quot; or &quot; Vigilance Committee,&quot; in emulation of the &quot; Committee of Action&quot; formed in England. Oerrish is endeavouring to throw his organisation (the proposed Quebec Independent Socialist Party) into the Sinn Fein agitation, and is &quot;looking hopefully for McSwiuey&apos;s death as a fillip to his meetings.&quot;The Foreign Colony.A secret Communist-Anarchist organisation has been established in a foreign colony near Wellandj called &quot; Ontario.&quot; The leader, a very extreme man named Teschkevich, declares labour &quot; everywhere &quot; ready to overthrow the present capitalist regime. This society is in touch with one in St. Catherine^. Its proximity to stores of explosives used in the work on the new canal has caused anxiety, the population of the district being largely Ukranian, Russian, and Polish.The strongly revolutionary tendencies of the foreign-born population in Toronto, Hamilton, and the Niagara peninsula, have been strengthened by recent events in Great Britain like the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; agitation and the threat of a general strike by the Tripie Alliance. The riot at Thorold, too, has had a bad moral effect upon them also, for they con-elude, first, that it would be easy to upset the Government by mob action, and, secondly, that the English-speaking working people are ready to revolt. It is noteworthy that the revolutionary press of Canada now derives mainly from the English where it formerly derived from the American revolutionary press. The promptitude with which revolutionary actions in England provoke imitation in Canada calls definitely for remark.Miscellaneous.The company which held the Labour Temple in Vancouver has become insolvent, and the temple has been taken over by the provisional government.   The tenants are. under notice to quit.It is believed that a new wireless is being erected at Charleston, U.S.A., by the Federated Press, an organised radical press system. This wireless is to be in direct communication with Russia, ostensibly to obtain correct news concerning the labour movement there.It is probable that the Winnipeg Typographical Union may refuse to set up the &quot; O.B.U. Bulletin,&quot; on the ground that it exists to destroy craft unionism.A strike on a big scale, to begin on 7th October, or as soon as severe weather sets in, appears to have been resolved upon in the coal mines of the Crow&apos;s Nest Pass.AUSTRALIA.Australians are growing restive under the cloud of Irish gnats. They look forward to the time when their prelates may be native-born instead of, as now, predominantly Irish.The recent strike meetings appear to have been a fiasco. Although the boilermakers&apos; and stovemakers&apos; unions refused to work, the engineers remained at their posts.    At a large meeting at the town hall the
engineers&apos; deputies deprecated revolutionary speeches and declared in favour of constitutional procedure. Moderate Labour in Australia, although lacking a leader, is sufficiently strong to support constitutional methods.Five hundred and sixty boilermakers were discharged in accordance with the Federal Government warning. This brings the total of discharges to about 2,000 persons.A Triple Alliance of Miners, Railwaymen, and Transport Workers is being formed on the same lines as the British alliauce. The transport workers in New South Wales are at present endeavouring to decide on action which will dislocate the Australian Shipping Order and force the companies to abandon the &quot; bureau &quot; system of engaging wharf labourers. This system was inaugurated during the big strike of 1917 to enable the companies to recruit free labour. The companies then undertook to give permanent employment to loyal workers, whom they now refuse to abandon. If the Unions insist a strike is inevitable. Few are in a position, however, to support a big strike with funds.SOUTH AFRICA.There have been no outstanding incidents of revolution or unrest. Loyalty of the Dutch delegates to the pledge given at the Union was the outstanding feature at the Dutch Bloemfontein Reunion Congress. The proceedings turned entirely on the Republican issue, and a sharp cleavage of opinion manifested itself. The Nationalists adopted an unyielding attitude, while the South African party would make no con-cession involving the withdrawal of the English-speaking members. The old &quot; backvelders,&quot; the men who fought hardest in the Anglo-Boer War, were the most determined against any reunion of the parties which would mean racial division. An ex-Cape rebel declared that as England had redeemed her pledges they were bound to stand by the Constitution, and if anybody tried to pull down the British flag his rifle would be raised in defenoe.The Manifesto of General Smuts has been very well received on the whole. The time certainly appears propitious for the formation of a great moderate party of South Africans of both races in support of the Union Constitution, which will declare itself against revolution, violation of the Constitution or lawlessness in any shape or form. The Nationalist Party, chagrined at the boldness of the Premiers pronouncement, is endeavouring to create discord among the Dutch.The 17-month strike of the Broken Hill Silver Mine is at an end, and the mine is to be re-opened shortly. The miners have been granted an increase of pay and improved working conditions.A Sinn Fein conspiracy was discovered on the S.S. &quot; War Soldier&quot; during her voyage from New York to Capetown. The firemen, save two of Irish birth, mutinied and attempted to seize the ship, speaking of the Irish &quot; Republic &quot; and of raising the red, white, and green flag instead of the Red Ensign. An American who refused to join the rebels was thrown overboard. The officers and the rest of the crew refused to continue the voyage to Africa with the firemen, who were taken off the ship by H.M.S. &quot; Constance,&quot; and sent to the Bermudas. A crew of negro firemen were subsequently signed on.No success appears to have attended the attempt to induce the Post and Railway employees in Lorenzo Marques to strike in sympathy with the Tramway workers.0 AS 8436 D
10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The Presidential Election.Competent observers calculate the chances of Senator Harding in the Presidential Election at about three to one. Senator Harding&apos;s declara-tion against interference in Ireland makes it unlikely that his return will bring about any change in American policy in that respect. Mr. Harding&apos;s return would, of course, in accordance with the principles upon which lie is seeking election, delay the entry of America into the League of Nations. But there are circumstances which render it probable that this delay will not niuch exceed two years.Nearly all the South American States have joined the League, and it is more than possible that the Monroe doctrine, by its binding together of the new world as a whole, may end by influencing America in, this direction also. The vital importance of such a move and the impetus Avhich the League of Nations will receive as soon as America joins, require no comment.Trade with Russia.The restrictions on trade and communication between the United States and Soviet Russia have now been removed by action of the Department of State. Restrictions pertaining to the shipment of materials susceptible of immediate use for Avar purposes have, however, been maintained. The United States Government accepts no responsi-bility for such trade, nor will protection be afforded to any of its citizens who travel in or trade with Russia, they do so at their own risk. American consular officers have been instructed to &quot; take no action &quot; which, officially or unofficially, directly or indirectly, assists or &quot; facilitates commercial or other dealings between American citizens, &quot; whether domiciled in the United States or in foreign parts.&quot; No change will be made in the visa regulations now in force, nor will passports for Russia be issued.John Milholland, of Washington and New York, forms a link between Sinn Fein and the Martens Bureau. This man, who is a professional lobbyist, is very active when in Washington as an Irish agitator. During the first three months of this year he held daily conferences with Martens and Nuorteva in Washington. Milholland also had several interviews with Dudley Field Malone and Phillip Francis, editor of three of Hearst&apos;s newspapers, and was no doubt influential in enlisting the sympathy of the Hearst Press for the Sinn Fein cause.Santeri Nuorteva, Martens&apos; lieutenant, now in Russia, an enemy of England and America, whose malignity has been envenomed by the desire of both countries to be quit of his presence, has been appointed head of the Anglo-American Department in the Bolshevik Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, an appointment likely to prove an obstacle to any understanding between Russia and either country.Martens&apos; Bureau.The sum of four million dollars has recently been received by Colonel Roustam Bek to subsidise any American and Canadian labour organisa-tion which will form illegal revolutionary societies and declare their adherence to the Third International.Martens&apos; Bureau is conducting a campaign against Louis C. Fraina and the American Communist Party. Fraina attended the recent Congress of the Third International in Moscow,
Uncut diamonds weighing 13! carats and valued by the Customs authorities at between 35,000 and 40,000 dollars were found last month on Niele Jakobson, a seaman on tho S.S. &quot; Stockholm.&quot; The stones together with a type-written letter in German, dated 7th July 1920, addressed to &quot; Genosse Martens,&quot; were given to Jakobson by Erikson, a Customs guard in the Swedish Service. This was the fourth trip on which Jakobson had carried similar packages for the same persons, addressed to &quot;Mr. Boris,&quot; an alias of Martens. On his previous trip he delivered the package to a short, stout man, most probably Santeri Nuorteva. This man, the following night, was accompanied by another, since identified as Mischa Safron, who gave him a Package to take back to Erikson, in Sweden. Safron has now been arrested, charged with conspiracy to smuggle.In addition to the stones, Jakobson also carried Bolshevisk news-papers and pamphlets printed in Russian, Finnish, and Lettish, and a pamphlet in English, entitled &quot;The Communist International to the &quot; I.W.W. An Appeal of the Executive Committee of the Third Inter-&quot; national at Moscow.&quot; Two albums of Soviet pictures were found in his bunk.Irish Affairs.American sympathies have indeed been, to some extent, alienated from the cause of Ireland by the tactics of de Valera which show Americans the sort of thing England has to deal with in Ireland. Never since the introduction of the present Home Rule Bill in its original form has the Irish question been treated with such restraint and with so manifest a desire for fairness. Suspicion that de Valera is in relations with Bolshevist Extremists identifies him with those disruptive elements of society which Americans hate, fear, and have themselves no scruples in repressing.Much feeling has been arroused by the report that Sinn Fein money is being used by the Irish Information Bureau, at Washington, to influence the election. Irish efforts to produce a wave of sympathy for either Archbishop Mannix or Mr. McSwiney have, on the whole, failed, and Irish persistence has so tired the public that even the fear of losing the Irish vote hardly rjrevents politicians of both parties from being rude about Ireland.A &quot;Committee of 100&quot; has been initiated by &quot;The Nation,&quot; a weekly newspaper never remarkable for its friendship for England. This Committee is to &quot; investigate the atrocities, both English and Irish, in England.&quot; Sir Auckland Geddes has been invited to suggest the names of witnesses for the British and de Valera for Sinn Fein.Extremists.The breach between ultra-radicals and moderate Labour appears to be steadily widening. The course of the various strikes called for the beginning of September has not fulfilled the expectation of the organisers, but until Labour has been convinced that it must meet capital half way, and by reason of the changed economic conditions, can no longer assume the role of autocrat with which the war endowed it, the struggle must continue.The executive council of the American Federation of Labour, presided over by Mr. Gompers, has decided, however, not to attempt to force the Union in any large industries, particularly in the United States Steel Corporation, as such action might result in the mills being closed aud many thousands of workmen being discharged who are friendly to the Union,   Labour has not yet forgotten its defeat in the steel mills lastp 2
year, and feels that to force union labour now on industries which in the past have fought successfully for tho open-shop principle would be to court failure.The police of the British International Federation of Trades Unions has been repudiated by the American Federation of Labour, which has declared against Bolshevism and the revolutionary Labour Movement in Europe.A statement to this effect signed by Mr. Gompers, President of the Federation, is considered to be an answer to the plot initiated by the Third International to create industrial disturbances in America as part of a world revolutionary movement.Friction is still reported among the Communists and many of the members refuse to recognise the United Communist Party.The work of that party will continue underground until after the Election, the plans being decided upon and carried out by the Central Committee. Implicit obedience is expected from members of the party, and no explanation concerning the disposal of donations will be given to anyone. The only branch which will work openly is the Defence Committee, formed to defend workers who are arrested and prosecuted by the Government for acts in defence of the working class. Interesting is the recent growth-of antagonism of members of the United Communist Party towards the Irish element in the party, which is accused of showing interest only in the Freedom of Ireland, and not in Communism for its own sake.The A.merican Socialist Society, the organisation which operates the Rand School of Social Science, has been fined $3,000 by the Federal Court, New York City, for obstruction of recruiting by publishing Scott Nearing&apos;s pamphlet &quot; The Great Madness.&quot; Scott Nearing himself was acquitted.According to an article by Alexander Stocklitsky, who is under indictment in the U.S.A., which appeared in &quot;Izvestiya&quot; of 13th July, a majority of the Socialist Party of America has recorded its desire to join the Third International, much against the will of the Executive Committee, who were obliged to ask for admission. A year ago the Executive Committee expelled 40,000 members who held that the party should break with the Second &quot; Yellow&quot; International and join the Communist International. The leaders, Hillquit aud Bergers, have now had their hands forced.The fatal explosion in Wall Street is generally believed to have been the work of extreme agitators.A miniature civil war is in progress in West Virginia, covering 8 or 10 counties. A three-hour fight took place at a place called Willis-branch between striking miners and private mine guards, but no casualties were reported.Strikes and Precautionary Measures.The strike of the longshoremen in New York and Boston still continues, and is said to have been planned by Jim Larkin in prison. Its purpose is an attack on Great Britain by a world-wide boycott of her ships and trade. The negro associations, led by Marcus Garvey, have promised their aid, but, in view of their treatment by the Irish long-shoremen in normal times, they demand a guarantee of co-fraternal consideration. TheFriends of Freedom for India and the Zionists have expressed sympathy with the strike, and Dr. Maloney, who has given liberally to the Picket fund, has offered to collect funds.
Lurid and seditious placards are carried by the pickets, of which the following are examples: &quot; Trouble on British Ships. If you touch British ships you are foes to Liberty. England is Liborty&apos;s enemy. She is dirty; keep off her ships.   Keep clear of the &apos; Baltic&apos; &quot;&quot; Trouble on British Ships. British seamen have British ships tied up. British Marine Law means Slavery. So keep off. Work any ship but a Britisher.&quot;&quot; Longshoremen, England is shootiug down labour in Ireland. If you have guts, show your teeth.   Hang up her ships.&quot;Some placards, in intelligent but as yet unfulfilled anticipation, announced &quot; Terence MacSwiney is dead.   His soul goes marching on.&quot; &quot; MacSwiney is released.   Lloyd George admits that British Law is dead.&quot;As an American newspaper pertinently remarks : &quot; The professional &quot; champions of Ireland are manoeuvring for a purely political strike in &quot; order to attain an object which does not concern, aud cannot assist, the &quot; welfare of American labour.&quot; Why should the demonstration, it goes on to ask, be directed against the public at the American end of the voyage ?The unauthorised strike of the longshoremen who sympathise with the Lord Major of Cork aud Dr. MacSwiney was completely unsuccessful. Their attempt to prevent the sailing of British liners from New York was frustrated by the clerks of the International Mercantile Marine, who donned overalls, loaded the mails, &amp;c, and the boats sailed at scheduled time.Au interesting experiment is that of the United Hebrew Trades, representing 250,000 organised workers in and around New York, who propose to open a labour bureau on Ellis Island to inform immigrants on industrial conditions, to direct incoming workers to centres where shortage of labour exists, and to divert them from centres where strikes aud lock-outs are in progress. The scheme will, it is thought, obtain the backing of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.11. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.Evidence is accumulating that revolutionary and semi-revolutionary bodies are taking advantage of the supineness of the Government.Government lethargy in regard to the anarchy which has existed for over a year is one of the chief causes of the uneasiness felt among local directors of industry. The workmen have no tangible economic grievances, there are no complaints as to housing, pay, or hours of labour. Indeed, since December last, the Forestal Company has received no complaints at all regarding conditions of labour and men travel considerable distances to obtain employment with such companies.Unfortunately, the workmen are under the influence of revolutionary agitators, chiefly Spaniards, who have persuaded some of the local Police to join their Unions.  .A &quot; Soviet,&quot; well supplied with arms and ammunition, has secretly been established at the Villa Ana factory.   The traffic in arms, carried
on without restriction of sale or purchase, has attained alarming pro-portions. Apparently the extremists intend to demand the liberation of &quot; social&quot; prisoners, like those concerned in the murder of Mr. Branchini, a local manager of the (British) Forestal Land Company ; and refusal would be made the pretext for a general strike accompanied by the forcible seizure of the Company&apos;s property and the violent coercion of all recalcitrant workmen.Strikes.In the course of a strike at the Las Palmas Sugar establishment in the Chaco, a British concern, the factory was besieged by 500 armed Avorkmen ; of the defenders, among whom were the manager and his family, one was killed and tAVo Avounded. For a time, thanks to the prompt arrival of troops the strikers were repelled and retired to their homes. But the local situation remains so serious that it amounts to anarchy. The Company have granted in all a 50 per cent, increase of Avages since August 1919, and a reduction from a 12 to an 8 hour working day, with free quarters and fuel, and there is no doubt that the strike is merely a pretext for an invasion and confiscation of the Com-pany&apos;s properties.It is evident that the interests of the strikers are watched and controlled by Anarchists in Buenos Aires by means of agents amongst the federated Avorkmen ; the movements of drafts of free labour are quickly known and the drafts only reach their destination with great difficulty.The Company, after taking legal advice, attempted to evict the strikers from their houses to make room for the new drafts, bat found the men were armed with rifles&quot;, obtained- chiefly from Paraguay, and were firmly entreuched in their houses.The Government have notified their intention oi recalling 70 out of the 100 troops at present ou guard, and it is feared that the handful left will be insufficient to save the property.The Federation Obrera Maritima has declared a boycott against the Company at the Port of Las Palmas in order to assist the strikers. The secretary of the F.O.M. has his own office at the Ministry of the Interior, and the Directors Avere referred to him when they applied to the Minister of the Interior for assistance in settling the strike. Naturally they refused his intervention.A system of blackmail, connived at by the Government, has enabled the F.O.M. to neutralise the drastic action of the Mihanovich and other companies in suspending their river service, Avhich resulted in a paralysis, of the service of the interior, a large reduction in the service to Uruguay, and the doubling of the time required to load ocean liners. Now, Iioav-ever, the F.O.M. agents not only &quot; enter business premises and examine &quot; the books to satisfy themselves as to the declarations that goods for &quot; export are not from firms boycotted by the F.O.M., but also levy fees, &quot; Avhich in the case of hides, for example, have amounted to seven dollars &quot; per 2,000 hides, or 21 dollars per 5,000.&quot; There is reason to believe that the Federation leaders Avish to bring matters to a head and that they intend to organise a general strike throughout the Republic at an early late.Two stokers, an Austrian and a Paraguayan, Avho formed part of the group of Mihanovich strikers who attacked the Captain of the S.S. &quot; Labrador &quot; on 31st May, have received the maximum penalty of three years&apos; imprisonment, under the section of the Social Defence Laws Avhich deals with persons convicted of attempting by insults or threats to compel others to join a strike movement. 1
Bomb Outrage.Bombs and weapons were recently found in Buenos Aires, followiug a bomb explosion in the house of a taxi-cab driver. It is possible that tho discovery is connected with oilier stores found in March last, and with a Bolshevik outbreak which the police had reason to believe was being organised. Two days later a dynamite bomb of high power, believed to be of the clockwork type, exploded iu the Criminal Court House. The bombs are identical with those seized by the police just before the great riots in January 1919. Eighteen Communist centres have been raided by the police, who arrested more than 200 known agitators.Sinn Fein.Sinn Fein agitation is being carried on by a Society known as &quot; El Comite Argentino de la Joventad pro Liber tad de lrlanda.&quot; This Comite appears to be working conjointly with the &quot;Liga Democratica de la Naciones,&quot; and is circulating an anti-British leaflet entitled the &quot;English Ultimatum to Russia.&quot;A Hungarian ex-professor of the University of Budapest, Conde Somosky, is also assisting the Sinn Fein cause, instructed by colleagues in the States and in Germany. He is a great friend of Dr. Zeballos, and received correspondence from Bela Kun said to be conveyed through sailors belonging to English vessels.An Irish delegate, Santiago C. Gubbins, who arrived from Ireland some three months ago is reported to be receiving propaganda and money from the States. He proposes leaving for the United Kingdom in the course of a few mouths.The &quot; Comite pro Libertad de Irlande &quot; is assisting the Arab Colony in Buenos Aires to form an association to agitate for Arab liberty and independence from England and France. The Sinn Feiners and Germans are also aiding them in every possible way.South American States.The draft Convention signed by the Delegates of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraquay, Peru, Uruguay, and the Argentine Republic at the Police Conference held in Buenos Aires in February last has now been approved by Presidential Decree. This Convention dealt with the suppression of crime and inter-communication of data concerning undesirable persons.PANAMA.Scurrilous cartoons hostile to Allied action in regard to Germany and Soviet Governments in general have recently appeared in a monthly periodical named &quot; Quasimodo,&quot; and the daily paper, &quot; Diario de Pauama,&quot; is both pro-German and pro-Bolshevik. Two of the members of the editorial staff of &apos;&apos; Quasimodo,&quot; who were largely responsible for this propaganda Dr. Canales, a Porto Rican, and Senor Barcos, a native of the Argentine Republic have recently left Panama for the Argentine.CHILE.The authorities have decided to take drastic action against foreign agitators who are regarded as responsible for the prevalent unrest, and the registration of all foreigners is being enforced. The real source of the agitation has been traced to the Industrial Workers of the World in
Valparaiso. Their premises were recently raided and the persons present, caught in fiagrante delicto, marched off to prison ; 67 persons are said to have been arrested, among their number being some of the Australian I.W.W. deportees whe arrived in Chile in 1918. The leader of this Bolshevist confederation, a Chilean named Juan Chamorro, committed suicide while under detention. Considerable financial support for the movement is reported to have been sent from the United States.
1. THE OCCUPATION OF THE ITALIAN IRON AND STEEL WORKS.The occupation by the workers of the Italian Iron and Steel Works is pregnant with more immediate effects upon the industrial situation in other European countries than anything which has occurred in Soviet Russia. The fact that the workers for a time took over all the big iron and steel works, factories, and yards throughout Italy, established Workmen&apos;s Committees, assumed their management, and pretended to run them with an increase of productive poAver, affords a more plausible model for industrial agitation in highly organised communities than anything that Russia can show. The further fact that the Government has completely sided Avith the men Avill probably guide our own syndicates-calists to the line of least resistance. And, indeed, plans for similar impending seizures in this country have already been reported, and the approaches of the &quot; Coventry Soviet &quot; to the Mayor of Coventry shows distinct signs of Italian influence.It must not be supposed that any sudden revolution has been brought nearer in Italy. The impression of impending violence has been caused by highly coloured descriptions of the armed Red Guards, of the elaborate organisation for the defence of the invaded plants with hand bombs, machine guns, and field artillery, as well as barbed and electrified wire. The Avorkers&apos; armament has often been exaggerated. Fifty rifles in very dirty condition, 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and a box under the table of bombs, adaptations of the old German egg bomb fitted on the percus-sion principle, not very deadly and extremely uncertain, and others, fuse affairs on the jam-tin principle of 1915, constituted the meagre armament of one of the largest works in Italy. The workers&apos; preparations for defence, in fact, were more apparent and theatrical than real. They were not due to any danger of attack. Coercive measures, it &quot;ivas known, Avould not be taken to solve a crisis, which, had they been adopted from the very beginning, could not haAre been averted. There is no doubt that by any considerable exercise of force on the part of the Government the factories could have been captured.But there is no doubt either that if the authorities had attempted to regain posseesion of the invaded works by force they would have failed. The dispute was of its nature economic. The metal Avorkers resorted to the invasion of the Avorks and factories in order to compel their employers to increase their wages and to prevent a lock-out. Extremist leaders naturally played their part, but Avhatever their hopes may have been that the experiment would lead to a complete revolution, the Avorkers were throughout prepared to draw back in case the main object of the agitation, the increase of wages desired, was attained.The authorities, hoAvever, Avere really as powerless as if the men had actually been able to make an effective resistance. Many of the metal Avorkers were ex-service men. As a last resort they could damage machinery or destroy the works, and they were well known to have the resolute backing of the Italian Confederation of Labour and other organisations who, if they were attacked, Avould have proclaimed a general strike. The army, moreover, was only partially reliable. Cara-bineers and Guardie Avere said to be longing to get to work, but little
reliance was placed on&quot; ordinary troops. Recruits recently called up marched to the station singing tho &quot; Rod Flag,&quot; in spite of the protests of their officers. Reservists, if they had been called out, would have come unwillingly, and would, it was thought, not be amenable to orders. In fact, coercive and repressive measures and the employment of armed force would have led to strikes, bloodshed, something not unlike civil war, and possibly a revolution.The Government, moved by a policy of pure expediency, decided to expouse the cause of the workmen. They appear to have done so at first simply by process of non-interference. In Milan the Prefect received instructions to deal with the situation as he thought best, the Govern-meut thereby divesting itself of responsibility for such action as he might take. As events developed, however, the Government^ policy hardened against the masters.Both Signor Giolitti and the Minister of Public Labour, Sigouri Labriola, are in favour of amending the industrial organisation of Italy on a co-operative basis, Labriola is himself an exponent of Syndicalist theories and finds the present occasion favourable to their exposition by compelling employers to share their profits with the workmen. The solution of the conflict is, in fact, based on formal recognition of the co-operative system.This has been made sufficiently clear by the declaration of the Italian Government published in the English Press on 17th September. It is emphasised by the reception accorded by M. Giolitti to a delegation of owners belonging to the Industrial League who waited on him towards the middle of September in order to lay their claims before him. M. Giolitti is reliably reported as having said to them: &quot;The Govern-&quot; inent has done all it can. If the owners resist it by violence it will &quot; employ force against them. It is of no use pretending that the &quot; present economic system does not require fundamental modifications. &quot; Workmen must be put into a position to control and check for &quot; themselves both industrial administration and industrial profits. From &quot; participation in profits some increase of production may be hoped. It &quot; is no longer admissible that the owner has the sole right to fix rates &quot; of pay. As regards their occupation of factories and other workshops &quot; the Government will try, as far as possible (M. Giolitti is said to &quot; have repeated these words three times with increased emphasis), to &quot; oppose it.&quot;In Italy itself the imminence of revolution is not feared. The extremists are no doubt prepared for everything and have received funds from the Bolsheviks, but it is their obvious policy not to press for an inopportune revolution whose failure would be inevitable. They will be satisfied with further similar experiments to prepare the ground for a future radical change of the social system. The gravity of recent events lies in their far-reaching effects, and for Englaud in particular in the example of an industrial community amending itself with the consent of governors and governed on a co-operative and profit-sharing basis.2. AN AMERICAN MERCHANT-ADVENTURER IN MOSCOW.Mr. Washington Baker Vanderlip, believed to be a cousin or nephew of Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip, lately of the New York City Bank, and one of the most influential financiers in America, is now in Moscow. There has been some mystery about this journey, but it has now transpired that he is representing commercial interests in California and is furnished with a letter of recommendation from Senator Harding and from several
American banks and syndicates. The Soviet Government was in considerable doubt as to whether he should be admitted. lie stayed in Copenhagen in touch with Litvinoff&apos; during the first three weeks in August, and then returned to London for a little more than a week before starting for Russia about the beginning of September. His arrival in OOVf 4Joponhagoxuwas announced by a wireless message in England addressed to Litviuoffat Christiania on 17th September.Mr. Vanderlip is trying to negotiate-an agreement by which the Americans would obtain large concessions in Kamtchatka. He wants a lease of the oil fields, in order to corner the oil against British subjects, who are his only serious rivals. Incidentally he wishes to obtain oil and coaling stations for the American Fleet on the Siberian coast, in order to provide for the contingency of war with Japan. The Soviet attitude was that no concession of a permanent character could be granted, but the Soviet Government seems not averse to granting a lease for a protracted period, such as 80 years ; it intimated that it had no sovereign power in Kamtchatka, which belonged to the Far Eastern Republic, but that it had sufficient influence with that Republic to make recommeuda-tions which would be acted upon. It seems to have felt that such an agreement would protect its eastern flank better than any agreement with the Chinese and Japanese proletariat would do ; moreover, that it would be a check upon Japanese ambitions.It has been clear throughout that Mr. Vanderlip is very anxious that his negotiations should not become known in Japan or in England, and it is difficult to understand why Tchitcherine sent his message en clairc to Litvinoff.There is nothing to show that the American authorities are aware of Mr. Vanderlip1s activities. The American attitude towards Soviet Russia has recently undergone a slight modification ; though it still abstains from diplomatic or trade relations with Russia it now grants visas for trade purposes to Russians proceeding to the United States, and presumably it will do nothing to interfere with Americans who go to Russia at their own risk. It is quite true that Mr. Vanderlip is using the political side lof his negotiations as a lever for obtaining concessions, and that neither the State Department nor even Senator Harding is cognisant of what he is saying. Nevertheless, his proceedings should be watched.3. THE DECAY OP AGRICULTURE IN RUSSIA.The condition of agriculture, the basis of all life in Russia, is critical in the extreme. Definite statistics regarding it are not available. It is possible that the highly centralised Bolshevik Commissariat of Agriculture may conceive that there are disadvantages in disclosing them ; it is even possible, highly centralised as it is, that the chaos of its own bureaucracy may make them impossible to obtain.Individual observers, however, are agreed. The decay of agriculture has reached a point where it is seriously endangering and has, perhaps, irreparably damaged the moral of the peasant population. The peasants, driven by the hostility and neglect of the Government to speculation in foodstuffs, have ceased to work, concentrating all their attention on trying to smuggle commodities into the towns, where they can get fabulous prices or articles of daily necessity in exchange. Of the precise effect on the occupation as a class and on their moral it is at present impossible to judge, but the consequences can be good for neither.
The principal causes of the disorganisation of agriculture itself are (1) The destruction of model or well-equipped farms and planta-tions ; and(2) The &quot; communisation&quot; of industry and trade, which really means the transfer of private enterprise into the hands of mushroom institutions incapably managed.When, on the destruction .of the landowners&apos; class, the Bolsheviks created &quot; Committees of the Poor,&quot; they sapped the basis of the then rural economy. The construction of these new committees was simple. A commissar called upon the poor to gather together and seize the superfluities of the bourgeoisie. The &quot;pour&quot; were simply hooligans who did not want to work. They armed themselves and attacked &quot; the bourgeoisie,&quot; in reality the same peasants as themselves, who with the same amount of land and the same cottages worked for their bread. The &quot; poor&quot; robbed them of everything of their bread, their flour, their potatoes, their eggs, their honey and left them only a day&apos;s or at best a week&apos;s provision, the amount varying with individual &quot; committees.&quot;This plunder, encouraged by Government, killed peasant industry. The peasants declined to work for nothing. Of their superfluities they got rid into rivers or other receptacles for refuse. Guard detachments were then formed out of the &quot; Poor Committees.&quot; The belongings of peasants were registered and their transport prohibited. Then hunger strikes began, the peasants refusing to supply the soldiers with food.Realising that they had carried things too far, the Government next abolished the &quot; Committees of the Poor.&quot; But they left the Guard Detachments to exercise &quot; socialistic control&quot; over the rural industries. Trade was forbidden, even between two districts of one province. Permission for each transaction had to be obtained from the Commissariat of Foodstuffs, the Commissariat for Agriculture, the Provincial Soviet, and the District Soviet.The waste of time and energy involved was incredible. The imposition of all these formalities by an ignorant bureaucraey upon a starving country, where all moral feeling was replaced by the one thought of how to exist, accounts for the hatred of peasantry for the Government and Guard Detachments.Between the peasants and the latter a struggle for life or death is being carried on. The Guard Detachments conceive that they have to live. They produce nothing. They are not fed by the Government. They are refused food by the peasantry. No resort is left to them but to maraud.The process of requisitioning, on the other hand, has also broken down, The hostility of the inhabitants, who hide their supplies, the shortage of transport, the general poverty, and the unheard-of prices have prevented the Commissariat for Foodstuffs from obtaining any but the smallest portion of the supplies. In fact, Government requisitioning only provides for the inhabitants of the Kremlin, the four houses of the Soviets, and other Communists.   The inhabitants at large are starving.The two organisations concerned in the supply and distribution of foodstuffs are (1) the Commissariat of Foodstuffs ; (2) the Commissariat of Agriculture. Only negligible supplies are sent to the latter. The Commissariat for Foodstuffs is not an agrarian institution. It could not get into its head that the requirements of the Commissariat for Agriculture were dictated by nature. The consequence was that the Commissariat for Agriculture always received its seeds too late for useful
distribution among its various provincial, district, and parish depart-ments. Harvests decreased by 50 per cent. The Communists took care to deduct their share. The peasants were left with practically nothing. In the Dmitrovskoe district, Moscow province, after the oats had been divided, only 5 lbs. were available for each peasaiit household.At the beginning of April 1920 the Commissariat for Agriculture of the Moscow Province was informed by the Commissariat for Foodstuffs that 2,000,000 poods of seed potatoes were going to be handed over to it. Of this it was estimated that not one thousandth part would be planted in time. The peasants decrease their planting and sowing partly from lack of seeds and partly because they do not want to work for the idlers. By the centralisation of products transport is encumbered, products perish, and the sowing has come too late.Again, the establishment of an eight-hour working day in the estates is disastrous in a country over a great portion of which the summer is so short.The Moscow Provincial Alliance of Co-operative Unions, the only organisation of the sort which has to some extent retained its indepen-dence, last year bought seed from abroad. But the greater part of what it bought was requisitioned from it by the Commissariat for Agriculture, which would not allow the Co-operative Union to issue seed without its sanction. This Co-operative Union is described as a well-organised institution, keen to enter into direct trade relations with Great Britain without Bolshevik interference. Its competence had no weight with the Bolsheviks,whose cumbrous methods of distribution are derived from Com-munist theory and are therefore above criticism.In many parts of Russia disease among the horses has broken down local transport. This disease was in a sense the direct consequence of the &quot; fuel compulsion,&quot; which laid down that every village must in winter saw and deliver a certain quantity of firewood to the nearest railway station. Horses which strained themselves in doing this work were replaced by diseased horses from the front. Disease, and pur-ticularly the itch, spread both among horses and from them to the human beings.The shortage of iron is also acute. Iron cannot be had for horse-shoes or even for nails for such horseshoes as can be made. A peasant who has broken a cart-wheel can find neither wheel nor wheeler for hundreds of versts. Nor can he obtain iron for the felloe of the wheel or seasoned timber for the remainder. A scythe of recent Russian manu-facture is a positive danger. Only old Austrian scythes are of use. Shovels, rakes, and pitchforks bend or break the first time they are used.The Commissariat for Agriculture has not been more successful in management that in distribution. It took over all farms and plantations which had survived the plundering and put them in the hands of Com-munist managers responsible to the respective authorities. The farms were stocked with such cattle as the peasants had left, but the men put in charge by the Bolsheviks knew nothing either of the theory or practice of the work they were to do. The manager of one estate was a sanitary orderly from the Medical Corps, his assistant a parish clerk. With the best will in the world to their work they were hampered at every turn by the controllers above them. These controllers were principally old Government officials equipped with a fine flow of Bolshevik oratory. Their &quot;control &quot; consisted in going to the estates, loading their carriages with food, and leaving to report to their authorities that everything Avas
for the best in the best of all possible districts. Only when non-Communistic specialists were called in to consider the situation did they discover that the Governments hopeless losses on these estates.The &quot; new landowner &quot; had also to cope with the hostility of the peasants who in the old days could, at any rate, negotiate with landowners who were reasonable people, and knew that allowance must be made for times and seasons. Things have actually gone so far that in some parts of Russia the Bolshevik authorities, convinced at last by the appalling condition of the farms, have returned them to their previous owners.In the matter of agriculture all the evidence tends to show that the Bolshevik projects are barren except on paper, and fruitful only in the breeding of offices.4. FRANCE AND THE LESSER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES OFTHE EAST.Note. - The following Report has been compiled by a student oj the Assyro-Chaldeans, who has obtained information of recent developments from a local professor of the Chaldean community.There are in the East six Christian Churches in schism from Rome, and in her eyes heretical, known as the Lesser Eastern Churches as distinct from the great Orthodox Eastern Church. Though not all holding the same heresy, they have otherwise much in common which lends to their consideration together in contra-distinction to Western Christendom.Since the Council of Florence in 1439 certain elements in each of these churches have come back into communion with Rome, renouncing their heresy but reclaiming.their respective Eastern rites and language ; the term &quot; Uniate &quot; being prefixed as a rule to their national name to mark their return to Rome.Of these Lesser Eastern Churches, the two that are of interest in the present connection are tlie Nestorians or &quot; Assyrians&quot; with their &quot; Uniates&quot; the Chaldeans, aud the Jacobites with their corresponding &quot; Uniates &quot; the Uniate Syrians. Other Christians in Syria are the Maronites, a formerly heretical but now &quot; Uniate&quot; body of some 300,000 living in the Lebanon.During the war most of the above-mentioned churches suffered massacres and persecution from the Turks and Kurds, which greatly reduced their numbers. Of an estimated 200,000 Nestorians there remain scarcely 50,000 scattered around Mosul, Baghdad, aud the Caucasus. The Chaldeans suffered less proportionately. Before the war they were about 100,000. By conversions their numbers have increased, if anything, as explained below. The Jacobite Syrians suffered little, and their pre-war number of 250,000 probably holds good to-day. The Uniate Syrians were never more than 40,000, and this is about their present number.Seeing themselves threatened with extinction, the Christians who were being massacred by the Kurds and Turks sank for the time being their dogmatic differences and rallied ou the ground of their common origin, hoping thus to maintain themselves as a people. This was the easier in that, ou the score of which they are heretics, those dogmas mean little or nothing to the lay members. On.a question of tenets regarding the manner of union of the divine and the human in Christ, even the higher ecclesiastics, among the heretics at least, are vague, and ready to forego them in the face of the common danger.
Forming themselves into a body and calling themselves Assyro-Chaldeans, they were anxious to secure British or French protection. The French they had known before the war, but their acquaintance with the British made them in many ways prefer the latter.Some 45,000 Nestorians and Chaldeans had taken refuge in Trans -Caucasia. Among them Malik Kembar, a cultured and well-educated Chaldean, head of the Jelo tribe east of Lake Van.He came to Constantinople seeking the protection of England or France for the exiles. Meeting with little success from the British he turned to the French, who referred him to General Gouraud as controlling Syria,The Assyro-Chaldeans resent the support given by the Allies to the national aspirations of the Kurds the people who were foremost in persecuting them hence the unhappy incident of the murder of British political officers at Amadia in the autumn of 1919, for which, it is said, 10 Chaldeans were hanged.To General Gouraud then, went Malik Kembar with a scheme for establishing a settlement of Assyro-Chaldeans along the Konia-Mosul railway and its branches, which have lately been acquired by the French. The idea has apparently been viewed favourably by General Gouraud. Malik Kembar, after seeing him at Beirut, came to Constantinople to await instructions, and has recently been summoned by him afresh to Syria. Such a scheme would have obvious advantages economic, religious, and political for the Assyro-Chaldeans, who are excellent agriculturists and tillers of the soil.The Uniate Patriarch is willing to waive his rights in favour of the Nestorian Primate if the latter will come into the Roman obedience and faith. The Jacobites and Uniate Syrians would probably associate themselves, and the Chaldeans feel certain that numbers of the sur-rounding tribesy both Nestorians and Moslem, Mould also come over if they saw the Chaldeans protected and prosperous. Already there have been from among them many professions of complete unanimity with the Chaldeans.If the settlement spreads far enough south it is quite possible that it would link up with the Maronites, and this possibility is envisaged by the authors of the movement. It is not, however, likely that the Greeks, either Orthodox or Melkites, would be drawn into the scheme though no opposition from them is foreseen.The Assyro-Chaldeans have elected two Chaldean advocates to be their delegates at the Peace Conference, where they are now putting forward the claims of their people to political recognition. Lady Sykes has also promised to help financially in the scheme.To the French there is also much to recommend the venture. Frauce, the &quot; Elder Daughter of the Church,&quot; is quick to see the advantages of a &quot; colony &quot; founded on religious unity. Her anti-clericism, lately much modified, is not for &quot; export,&quot; and this scheme offers a way of fostering French influence and prestige, in the same way as has been done by the Maronites of the Lebanon, who for years have looked to France for culture and tutelage. Beirut has long been a centre of French Catholic influence. When France tries to demonstrate her rights over Syria it has always been Beirut which supplied the proofs. On the effective control of Syria depends the possibilities of transporting Mesopotamian oil.A further spread of French culture would go far to simplify the task which the French have undertaken in Syria, and this point gains significance from the recent pronouncements of M. Honnorat, the French Minister of Public Instruction, on the need of disseminating the literature
and culture of Frauce, &quot; whose greatest prestige will always be in tho domain of intellect.&quot;There is little doubt that wliat education there is among these people is with the &quot; Uniates&quot; their ecclesiastics first, and the lay members also, number meu of considerable attainments. The importance of the Eastern Catholic Church in the future was recognised by Benedict XV. in 1917, when, to the several &quot;congregations,&quot; such as that of the Index presided over each by a cardinal, he added that of &quot; The Eastern Church &quot; to deal with the new situation created for these bodies. France to-day has need of the Vatican&apos;s influence in her diplomacy which aims, it is said, at an alliance with Poland and the Buffer States emerging from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Protection of the Eastern Catholics would gratify the Pope.This plan of the Assyro-Chaldeans, following so closely on the foundation of a National Home for the Jews in Palestine, suggests a parallel; but in comparison the Assyro-Chaldean scheme looks the more promising of the two. It is founded on an unbroken tradition of the oldest inhabitants of the land, and is a nucleus with elements of unity and elasticity capable of large development on national lines. In a land where religion means so much to the natives it is as likely to appeal to the people as it is to benefit those who foster its growth.
