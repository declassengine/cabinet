^--- this Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&apos;1 9 8 4     ) Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   October 1920.EXTENSION OF FREE PASSAGE SCHEME FOR EX-SERVICE MEN.I WISH to suggest the desirability of extending for a further period the scheme of free passages for ex-service men and women which was announced in the House of Commons on the 8th April, 1919. As at present arranged, the last date for receiving applications under the scheme is the 31st December, 1920.The scheme was originally sanctioned on the recommendation of the Oversea Settlement Committee, who, in a memorandum submitted to the Cabinet in February 1919, urged that as a recognition of the war services of the fighting forces of this country, His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the policy favoured by the Empire Settlement Committee, that those who have served in the present war should be allowed to claim within a reasonable time of demobilization, and subject to approval by the Oversea Governments concerned, free transport for themselves and their dependents to any destination within the British Empire. The Oversea Settlement Committee proposed three years as a reasonable period for the grant of this privilege. This would have carried the scheme to the end of March 192*2.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, however, that in the first instance it would suffice if the privilege remained open until the end of this year, when the matter might be reconsidered in the light of experience. Accordingly, in announcing the scheme in the House of Commons on the 8th April, 1919, Lieutenant-Colonel Amery used the following words : &quot; I should add that, in view of the prior claims of their own ex-service men for resettlement, the Dominion Governments are not likely to be in a position to welcome any British ex-service settlers before the end of the present year, even if shipping should be available for the purpose before that date. Applications from ex-service men and women will, however, be received for a year from the 31st December next or from the date of release from service, or, if necessary, for such period as may be found requisite to afford them ample time in which to make their choice between the opportunities for employment and settlement available in the United Kingdom and those available in the British Dominions overseas.&quot;These words contemplate an extension of the original period of the scheme in certain circumstances. I venture to submit that these circumstances have actually arisen.The scheme has been very successful, so far as it has gone, in giving to ex-service men and women the opportunity of taking advantage of suitable openings overseas which they would not otherwise have been able to accept.The Oversea Settlement Committee have received numerous letters from individual settlers expressing gratitude for the privilege granted to them, and speaking in high terms of their position and prospects in their new home. From the Canadian authorities, too, letters have been received showing that the women sent out under the scheme have been of a far better type than the great majority of ordinary settlers.The number of applications has, however, been comparatively small, considering the numbers who are eligible to apply, the total up to date being about 50,000, and more than half of these applications are still awaiting the decision of the Oversea Government representatives to whom they have been referred.There are several reasons for this state of affairs: (a.) In the first place, the Oversea Governments have been so busy dealing with their own returned soldiers that they have not been in a position to accept large numbers of British ex-service men, and those whom they have accepted have, in the main, been in the category of agricultural workers. There have been very few openings for British workers of other categories hitherto. The same argument applies in the case of ex-service women, whom, generally speaking, the Oversea Governments have not been prepared to approve, except as domestic servants.[4581]
(b.) Even apart from this, the shipping situation, principally owing to the require-ments of repatriation, has been such that no more than the numbers already dealt with could have been carried.(c.) At the same time, the Oversea Settlement Committee, who are administering the scheme, were, and still are, handicapped ,by lack of accommodation and shortage of staff, and cannot keep pace with the applications actually received.(d.) Further, as regards the women&apos;s side of the work, the Committee&apos;s machinery for dealing with women only began to be properly organised this year after the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women had been formed and subsidised by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is most desirable that the ex-service women should be given every opportunity of proceeding overseas. As the Committee have pointed out, there were last year, between the ages of 15 and 45, 1\ million more women than men in this country.For the reasons explained above, it has been impossible to advertise the scheme widely, and there is evidence that large numbers of ex-service men and women are still unaware of its existence.The Oversea Settlement Committee have been urged by the representatives of the; various self-governing Dominions to endeavour to secure the extension of the scheme on these grounds. As typical of these representations I may quote from a letter from the High Commissioner for New Zealand. After mentioning the points indicated in the preceding paragraphs of this Memorandum, he adds :--&quot; In addition to the above, so far as New Zealand is concerned, the limited shipping accommodation available is still largely required to provide passages for fiancees of New Zealand ex-service men and for persons nominated, during the war period and subsequently, by friends or relatives residing in New Zealand. Also, the grave housing shortage in the Dominion makes it impossible for me to accept, at present, otherwise desirable ex-service men, on account of their having families and having no friends or relatives in the Dominion willing to provide them with at least temporary accommodation. So acute is the position that my Government have directed me to confine my approval at present to single men and single - women, widows without dependents, and married couples without dependents who are going to assured employment.&quot; I have given this matter very careful consideration, and am convinced that it would be highly desirable to extend, by at least one year, the period during which applications under this scheme may be received. Striking evidence of the widespread ignorance regarding the scheme is afforded by the sub-leader in the &apos; Morning Post&apos; of the 24th September regarding ex-service men&apos;s associations, in which the Government is accused of having failed to produce any scheme whatsoever for assisting ex-service men to migrate to overseas portions of the&apos; Empire. The time does not yet appear to be ripe, however, for any speciak publicity campaign on the subject, as even the present limited number of applicants is far in excess of the shipping accommodation likely to be available for many months to come. In view of the amount of unemployment at present existing, and apparently likely to exist in increasing measure in the near future, it is reasonable to anticipate that, were an effort made at this juncture to give greater publicity to the scheme, the resultant crop of applications would be almost greater than the Committee could cope with, while the number of migrants actually despatched overseas would not be increased by a single soul. Also the inevitable delay in dealing with the greater number of applications on hand would be likely to cause unsettlement, dissatisfaction and discouragement among the applicants, besides leading to a greatly increased volume of correspondence. On the other hand, to close clown the scheme before many of those eligible to avail themselves of it have had reasonable opportunity for becoming aware of its provisions, would appear to be inflicting a hardship, if not an injustice, which I am sure the Imperial Government is most anxious to avoid.&quot;The only satisfactory method therefore would appear to be to extend the period during which applications may be received until at least the end of 1921, and so.ensure a steady flow of applications capable of being dealt with without undue delay.&quot; I trust, therefore, that the Imperial Government may see its way to agree to the extension suggested.&quot; &apos;
Even if it were decided that the present arrangement should stand, and that the scheme should not be extended beyond the end of the current year, it would be necessary to give prominent advertisement to the decision so that all concerned might be given due notice to enable those who wish to do so to put in their applications in time. This would, no doubt, lead to a rush of applications, many of which might possibly be made by people who were quite unsuited for settlement overseas. Such a rush would paralyse the machinery of the Oversea Settlement Committee, which is administering the scheme, unless a large increase in office accommodation and staff, with its consequent increase in expenditure, were sanctioned. Even then it is highly improbable, and the letter from the High Commissioner for New Zealand confirms this, that the Oversea Governments could deal immediately with applications in the mass, or, if they could, that shipping would be available to carry all the suitable applicants within a reasonable time. The tendency would probably be for the Oversea Governments to reject many applicants whom at a later date they might be prepared to accept. This would be unfortunate for the Dominions. It would also be unfair to the applicants themselves. Having been compelled to apply for free passages long before they had any prospect of leaving, they would, if accepted, be restless and unsettled during all the subsequent period of waiting, and, if rejected, would feel that they had a grievance, in that they might have been accepted had they been allowed to apply at a later date.As regards expense, when the Oversea Settlement Committee made their original recommendation they framed a conjectural statement of the total cost at about  6,000,000, of which  1,350,000 was calculated to be the figure for 1920-21, while  2,250,000 per annum was allowed for each of the two following years. This conjecture has so far proved very wide of the mark.The actual expenditure during the last financial year amounted to  51,252. The estimate for the current year was originally  900,000. This was reduced by the Treasury to  500,000, on the understanding that if any further expenditure were incurred it would be provided for in the Supplementary Estimates. The actual claims received on account of passages to the end of September last amounted to just under  300,000, and the total for 1920-21 is not likely to exceed  600,000. If the scheme is allowed to continue for another year (that being the least period which would meet the situation in the Dominions), it is probable that  750,000, possibly somewhat more, will be required for 1921-22.It must be borne in mind, in considering the cost of the scheme, that all money expended on the oversea settlement of suitable settlers from this country relieves to that extent the housing problem here and also tends to relieve in still greater proportion the problem of unemployment.M.October 15, 1920.
