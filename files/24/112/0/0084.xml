v/X j^oc^ment is the Property &apos;!(&apos; m :    ^4 6 ?ice?   y*\ his Britannic Majesty^ GoverS^        !Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.1/ a 11*0 !5 1 PiSECRET.I circulate herewith, in pursuance of a decision of the Cabinet (54 (20) Conclusion 9 of 12th October 1920), copies of a telegram sent to Sir Percy Cox, and of his reply regarding the mandate for Mesopotamia.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,dated 13th October 1920.(Repeated Viceroy.)Cabinet request me to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government may be called upon almost at any moment to submit draft mandates for approval of League of Nations. Text of draft mandate for Mesopotamia in its present form is substantially the same as that enclosed in Vansittart&apos;s Despatch No. 71 of 2nd August, of which I think you saw copy in London. Some alterations have since been introduced, mainly in direction of uniformity with Palestine mandate, but general character of document not modified. But important alteration is also proposed, in Article 5, in view of fact that in Syrian draft French have omitted limitation of use of local forces to defence of the country. It is desired 10 persuade them to restore it and to add following: &quot; such forces may only be recruited from the inhabitants of the territories under the mandate.&quot; If French do not agree, neither provision will appear in Mesopotamian mandate; if they do agree, both will be included. It is realised that in latter case some inconvenience may be involved for Mesopotamia, but it is thought that this is lesser evil than making it possible for French to maintain in Syria, for offensive purposes, large army recruited from outside. Cabinet request you to telegraph, clear the line, (1) whether you concur generally in terms of draft Mesopotamian mandate; and (2) whether you consider that it could be published at once, without embarrass-in ent to yourself, or whether you attach importance to further postponement. Please reply as soon as possible as matter is urgent.Telegram from Sir P. Cox, Baghdad, to Secretary of State for India,dated IQth October 1920.(Repeated Viceroy.)Your telegram of the 13th October. I do not remember precisely in what respect the draft of 2nd August differed from first draft issued by Foreign Office on 10th June, of which I have copy. iPresume, however, that Article V. first mentioned is practically same as Article II. of June draft. On above hypotheses I offer following comments : (1) I concur generally in the terms of mandate. (2) On the whole I welcome publication, and do not think we need be deterred by risk of some local criticism of particular points. (3) I am not sure what is the precise frontier finally accepted. Part of Kurdistan will no doubt be outside our limit, but as part will also be inside, I trust we shall not be prevented by Article V. from recruiting Kurds generally. (4) In any case 1 agree that it would be safer for us to press French to agree to inclusion of both provisions to which you refer even at risk of some inconvenience owing to restrictions of recruiting field.2521     100  10.20
