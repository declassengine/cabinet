VERY SECRET.MESOPOTAMIA.PRELIMINARY REPORT ON   CAUSES  OF  UNREST.by major N. N. E. BRAY, M.C., Special Intelligence Officer attacked to Political Department, India Office.Note. There is not sufficient space in the margin to show the references to documents and sources of information on which the statements contained herein are based.   These are shown separately in the &apos; Appendix and referred to in the margin.Various causes have been put forward as instrumental in producing the present difficult situation in Mesopotamia, their variety is confusing and contradictory, while as a whole they are severally contributary, we must seek elsewhere lor the creative force of the movement and for the machinery that gives it its cohesion. No local discontent or fault in administration is the true and sole cause, nor is any one society or political group sufficient in itself to produce an effect so spontaneous or affecting so many different sections of opinions. The pan-Arabs, the Nationalists, the disgruntled Effendi, the tribesman impatient of his enforced inaction, and the fanatical priest taken separately are innocuous, taken collectively form a very dangerous combination. Similarly no particular defect in Government or unpopular measure, is capable of directing so many divergent interests into one channel of hostility. The following paper is an attempt to show how and for what purpose all these factors have been utilized for provoking hostile and concerted action.We must constantly bear in mind one factor of supreme importance in reviewing events The Tribes, in Mesopotamia namely that the tribesmen though representing a powerful yet unstable element do not and can not of themselves dominate or create a political situation, they are a valuable adjunct or become a serious embarrassment as the case may be by providing a military weapon of no mean order.It is to the educated classes throughout the Jezerat-al-Arab that we look for political trouble cJaSgMucatGd or peace. These latter are prolific students of history (especially of Arabian history) though they are not always capable of deriving correct conclusions therefrom. They take the keenest interest in and keep in constant touch with European politics, they are saturated with intrigues, provide a host of valuable speakers and plausible writers in addition large numbers of them have had military training both under the Turk and British and have considerable experience of actual warfare. Among them for years has grown up an Arab Nationalist spirit, for the pan-Arab movement is not a thing of recent growth, and before the war broke out preparations were well advanced for severance from Turkey. Independence is with them something very real. They therefore have all the necessary qualifications for being used as instruments by an outside organization, and it is necessary to thoroughly realise this in order to appreciate the fact that being imbued with these ideas, and being persuaded rightly, or wrongly, that their ideal was being threatened they could be easily persuaded to take the most drastic and fanatical action in defence of the same. It is necessary to appreciate this fact in order to realise that this party having legitimate aims for which many of them had sacrificed a good deal, were as a political party capable of producing a serious pan-Arab agitation and so causing considerable unrest; but it is doubtful if they could ever have reconciled the various sections of the community, sections which in many different directions are bitterly hostile. Time and the long uncertainty as to the future combined with the above have provided the means whereby, having been organized through various societies, and directed by outside influence through the medium of Berlin and Moscow, they have provided a powerful means of making concerted action possible. Similarly having been directed in using every possible source of dissatisfaction they have been able to rally to themselves a considerable following.The pro-Turkish elements have been similarly organized and directed till they too became Pro-Turkish capable of exercising considerable pressure in another direction. elements.These two objects having been achieved we shall see how, by an intensive propaganda  h0emp^^^^ though at heart bitterly opposed they were taught to realise that in effect their aims were identical, ana Turkish that they were.opposed to a common enemy, and that only by mutual support could they hope Appendix%&apos;. 8. to attain their object. 1 Appendix P. 9.

Stated very briefly these plans were Appendix p 13.      (a) By every possible means to discredit the Entente with each other thus preventing mutual support.Appendix p. 1      iP) Tne Nationalists to organize their forces in Anatolia and Trace, if possible obtainassistance in men, arms or money from the Bolshevists and Berlin. Appendix p. 8       (c) To prepare rebellion on a large scale in Syria and Mesopotamia. Appendix p. s. To organize all parties concerned so as to produce simultaneous action.These could not be carried out until the following arrangements had been completed :  (a) The careful organization of Nationalist elements in Turkey, Syria, and Mesopotamia.Appendix p. io.      ^ ^e alliance of the pan-Arab movement with the Turkish Nationalist movement.Appendix p. 5.      (c) The co-operation of the Tribes.Appendix p.&apos; il      (d) The unification of the whole on a pan-Islamist basis.When the unification was completed and all plans were ready the signal would be given, and simultaneous action would be taken that wo aid it was hoped, be of so wide spread a nature as to force the withdrawal of the British in Mesopotamia, and the French in Syria.  Various factors such as the Greek defeat of the Nationalists, French action in Syria, and the impatience of the tribes, have interposed themselves and so prevented the realisation of the full results hoped for, nevertheless, a large measure of success has been attained and still further efforts (a) organization will be made to bring yet other influences to bear in order to keep the agitation going and stultify a[ia\hparties02i any efforts of conciliation  In support of the foregoing we will trace the different results obtained. an(ikMe&apos;sopo-la UP to&apos;an(^ mcmding the outbreak of the disturbances in Mesopotamia.tamia. The scattered partisans of the Turkish Nationalists and pan-Arabs having as we shall seeiheNationai?st3 Deen collected through the agency of various societies, were by the autumn of 1919, so organized AptendV^p1^&apos;- as to ma^e their influence felt not only on the Damascus Government but in Baghdad.The Emir Feisal * (see note) found it increasingly difficult to maintain a moderating influence. Until November, 1919, he was able to maintain partial control, matters howrever, reached a climax when he was informed by His Majesty&apos;s Government that he should go to Paris and negotiate direct with the French, from whom he obtained little or no satisfaction. The result was, the extremists triumphed and Feisal himself bitterly disappointed lost his last vestige of control of the situation. From this period (November, 1919) events moved rapidly and it will be necessary to follow them as closely as the information at our disposal will allow. Appendix p. u. Feisal expresses himself to Zaqlul Pashas as being now bitterly anti-British, whilst Fuad al Katib his private secretary, ordinarily the most moderate of men, expresses similar feeling in verses vilifying the British that find their way to Syria, Switzerland and Berlin. i5.ii.io. About the 15th November, 1919, a very important meeting was held at Muntreux.   Thismeeting was presided over by Talaat who was specially summoned from Berlin but he did Appendix p. ii. not show himself until Feisal&apos;s representative had arrived. The object of the meeting was to discuss proposals (a) for a defensive alliance between the Damascus Government and Mustafa Kemal (b) to unite all the Chiefs of Arabia on a pan-Islamic basis, (e) to ask the King of the Hebjaz to head the movement and to forget all rivalry and personal, jealousies for the good of the common cause.On the 2nd or 3rd of December, 1919, Zaki Pasha Khersa arrived at the Belle Vue Palace Hotel in Berne where he met Amir Shakib Arsalan and delivered to him a message for Talaat Pasha to the effect that Feisal entirely concurred in the arrangements agreed to at the meeting at Montreux. Another meeting was held at St. Mortiz ; Talaat Pasha and Amir Shakib Arsalan attended this meeting discussed the possibility of an alliance between -the Bolshevists, Enver, Mustafa Kemal and the Arabs. The result of this conference was Appendix p. ii. evidently communicated to Amir Feisal, for in December (the exact date is doubtful) Amir &apos; Shakib Arsalan receives a letter from him saying he has the greatest confidence in his work  whilst evidently with reference to the above proposals he says he cannot agree to the above alliance unless the complete independence of Syria and Mesopotamia is recognised by Enver, Moscow, and Turkey.  He further authorised Amir Shakib Arsalan to go to Moscow to sound*Note. Emir Feisal in the following pages is frequently referred to as participating in anti-British endeavours. It must be borne in mind firstly that he was forced by the extremists to acquiese in action distasteful to him person-ally. Secondly : His name was used to assist in activities of which he may have had no cognisance. A clear example of this is evidenced by the documents received by Bin Saud who received a friendly and harmless letter signed by Feisal himself and attached to it another letter in the same hand-writing unsigned and containing a violent attack on the British. Thirdly : It is natural to suppose that being the leader of the Sherifian Army and head of the Arab Government, it was necessary for the extremists to act in his name, and for outside propagandists to quote it in order to convey the idea of official unity and strength to their transactions.2.12.197.1.20.

We have no information as to why ho did not go as suggested, but on 17.1.20 we have information that Amir Shakib Aksalan who was then at Sr. Moritz 17.1.20. had sent a letter to Litvinoff at Copenhagen in this connection.It is necessary now to turn our attention to -the efforts to incite the tribes, this can be ex- (c) co-operation plained more clearly by quoting various documents; from them we may assume much that hasof tho Tribcs&apos; gone before in the way of preparation and are better able to confine our investigations to the Appendix p. 0. period we have selected, viz., November, 1919, to April, .1920.Telegrams from the Under Secretary of War, Constantinople, to G.O.C.

Several Arab chiefs belonging to the same race and encouraged by these facts have given expression to ideals and plans which they have nourished secretly for some time. Thus the movement is openly expanding to Mesopotamia and Syria. As most of the directors among the Arab Patriots belong to the influential and intelligent classes of the Ottoman Empire, and as this movement has its mainspring in Islam, our National organization has been welcomed warmly and with confidence by the Nationalists in Mesopotamia and Syria. The representative body which takes in all movements in the Arab Towns and which is working solely to strengthen its position has done all in its power to fan and increase this wave of opinion.&quot; Turkish Mission left for Aleppo by orders of Mustafa Kemal with view to co-operation between Turks and Arabs.&quot;Extract of an announcement said to have been issued by Mustafa Kemal on July 12th, 1920 :-&quot; As a result of my journey of 7.6.36 certain essential matters were arranged between myself and the Chiefs of the Tribes. These same matters were then agreed to between the Chiefs and the Emir Feisal.&quot;We have unfortunately no original documents implicating the Arab Government of Damascus ParUcipation of in organizing the tribes though a large batch of papers is on its way from Baghdad and should Government, arrive shortly.%  We have, however, sufficient evidence from the reports of Sir A. T. Wilson, Appendix p. 1. G.O.C. Mesopotamia and Cairo, to exclude any doubt as to their participation, apart from constant references to mutual co-operation derived from Nationalist sources.* Note. One Tabbaba is reported to have been present at a meeting of the central Motjvahiddin Society at Angora.f Note. The Mouvahiddin Society will be described under &quot; Secret Societies.&quot; J Note. These have now been received and are included in the references shown in the Appendix.
SECRET SOCIETIES.A very groat number of these exist in Turkey, Anatolia and Syria, and wo find in tracing their activities that they link up eventually with Constantinople and Switzerland and from there Appendixp! io. ^oreign Office in Germany.  They are formed generally for some specific politicalAppendix p. 12] purpose, to &quot; tap &quot; as it were a new source of activityWe generally find that they contain the extremists elements and eventually exercise either singly, or in alliance with one another, powerful influence on the locally directing council or assembly, if we are correct in our appreciation of the intentions of our enemies, we find that a nationalist movement must be linked up with a religious, or anti-Christian movement. To exemplify this we must briefly note the activities of three such organizations. The Nadi-al-Arabi and Elahd in Syria and the Mouvahiddin Society* in Angora. The former started fairly quietly in Damascus, become more and more extreme as time went on until it has become completely pan-Islamist and in consequence Anti-European. It had by this time several branches including those in Aleppo and Constantinople and was in touch with Mesopotamian Nationalists. It is strikingly similar to the Mouvahiddin with whom it quickly allied itself. From several sources we have information that it exercised a powerful influence on the Damascus Congress.Mustafa Kemal writing in March 19, says &quot; The propaganda published by the two Arab papers appearing at Aleppo and Damascus which are subsidised fitly by us is due to the efforts of several Arab patriots amongst whom is Lieut.-Col. Izzet Eey and to the suggestions of the veterans of the Kida-ul-Arab.&quot;The following is a useful illustration of the form of instructions issued by the Headquarters of this Society at Damascus.   Extract of a letter addressed to the Muntada al Adaby  27.4.20.       &quot; guard the government and its steps.  Be very careful with same.   Do your best to know ofall that it prepares to do and that it is doing now and let us know everything.....9 ofour friends will arrive to you among them will be Jaafar Pasha. They have plans ready and they will show you what to do.  All this is to be made very secretly.&quot;&quot; Sheikh Abdul Kadr Mizrar.&quot; Salim Abdul Rahman.&quot;There is no advantage to be gained by discussing it at length and it is sufficient to say that it has had a considerable share in the pan-Islamist aspect of the trouble.Appendix p. 10. Tlie Mouvahiddin Society was convened on November 11th, 1919, at Sivas like the Nadi-al-Arabi it is extreme pan-Islamist, it recognises as its only object &quot;the assurance of acquisition by every possible means the independence and liberty of all Muslim countries living under foreign and Christian protection,&quot; a point of great interest is that action to achieve this appendix p. 8. purpose had been taken before its first meeting was held. In a short time it had merged itself with the Nationalist Movement, had combined with the Nadi-al-Arabi and claimed to have branches at Damascus, Homs, Baalek, Reshid, Haifa, Aleppo, Baghdad, Nejf and Kuweit.Appendix, p. 4. Bl Ahd the Mesopotamian League is composed of Mesopotamians of whom there are about 300 in Peisal&apos;s service. They were nearly all in Turkish Military employment. They are the leading personalities in the Arab State, and hold all the Military posts. This Society has carried out intensive propaganda throughout Mesopotamia and several documents of a hostile nature have been discovered bearing its seal.It was responsible for organizing the Mesopotamian pro-Turkish elements! referred to earlier in the report.We must now recapitulate. The meeting of Montreux proposed (a) a defensive affiance between the Damascus Government and Mustafa Kemal. This undoubtedly was agreed to though French action forestalled any advantage being taken of it, (b) to unite all the Chiefs of Arabia on a pan-Islamist basis. It was the task of the two Societies mentioned to achieve this. Our information from Baghdad, Mecca, Riadh, is sufficient to prove the scope and effectiveness of their efforts, (c) to ask the King of the Hecljaz to put himself at the head of the movement (Jihad). Without doubt he has been approached in the matter for we know that messengers passed to and from Constantinople, Damascus and Mecca and Raidh.Finally a very interesting document has fallen into our hands which has yet to be proved to be genuine but which fits in so well in the general scheme as to make it appear to be so. It is 24.5.20. dated Najaf-i-Sherif, May 24th, 1920, signed Abbas, Secretary to the Spiritual Chief of Nejaf, and is addressed to Mustafa Kemal, thanking him for the letters and presents he sent to the spiritual head of Najaf-i-Sherif, promises him, full support for the preaching of a Jihad, to send the &quot; necessary instructions to agents in Baluchistan, Persia, India and Hadramuth,&quot; to send a delegate &quot; who will be provided with all requisite powers &quot; to the Islamic Congress at Angora, and asks for 15,000 pounds in gold.* Note.-This Society has definitely proclaimed itself pro-Bolshevik. It has its representative in Moscow, and has converted 105 members of the Great National Assembly of Angora to Bolshevik principles.f Note. Yusinr SuwAiDiin his interview with Saiyed Talib at Baghdad on 28th July, 1920, said : &quot; The Nationalist party has been at work for six months and has accomplished marvels.&quot; Compare the above period with that selected as being necessary to organise the disturbances.

091 *j fa 1uth september, .1920.If this document is proved it completes the circle, but even if wo are unable to do so the gap is so small that we may safely sum up as follows: That the pro-Turkish Nationalists in Syria and Mesopotamia have been steadily organized since the Armistice but they were incapable of highly organized action till they were allied to the pan-Arab Movement which includes the co-oporation of the tribes, and that these in their turn could not be organized except on a religious basis. That time and circumstances have provided the means for these to be accomplished to such a degree as to enable a certain measure of co-operation. That the combined action contemplated has failed and that the success in the Appendix P. 3. future depends now largely on the Pan-Islamist movement. That both the Nationalist and Pan-Islamist movements derive their inspiration from Berlin through Switzerland and Moscow.The situation is further complicated with Italian, French and Bolshevist intrigues. It is not proposed to deal with these questions in the present report. All information available is being carefully sifted and already sufficient evidence is forthcoming to show that the task of our opponents is by no means easy of accomplishment, and that their plans have carried far short of what was intended and that the apparent cohesion of the present trouble is mainly artiiicial and can only continue under the most favourable circumstances. There are several factors that may be of the greatest assistance to us in our counter measures. A further note is in preparation showing the many conflicting interests and antagonisms of the various parties at present allied against us.In conclusion I would draw your attention to the fact that there is clear evidence that these disturbances have their origin from sources outside Syria and Mesopotamia; we have yet to track down their originators and organizers. That until we have done so we can hope for no permanent respite from dangers or outbreaks in every direction.The examination of the mass of information placed at my disposal confirms me in my strong belief that the various secret societies receive their inspiration from a comparatively small central organization that we may track down by a process of careful and methodical elimination.It is clear that Mustafa Kemal and the Amir, Feisal are both instruments for the Appendix p. 12. furtherance of far vaster schemes than those with which they personally have to deal. We see this clearly illustrated in the case of Mustafa Kemal by his constant hopes that the Entente by granting Turkey more favourable terms such as the retention of Smyrna would allow him to refuse extraneous assistance. We see it in his hatred of the Arab with whom he is forced to ally himself, throughout his negotiations with the Bolshevists and with Enver, and in his circular to newspapers subsidised by him, not to be too violent in their attacks on the Entente and especially in his distaste of the Pan-Islamist programme yet, we find, in spite of himself he is forced to use all these for the furtherance of schemes with which he has no sympathies.A close study of FeisaFs attitude throughout reveals the same helplessness against this outside influence he too has clearly fallen a victim to the extremists. Thus we see that the extremist parties gradually organize into various societies obtain a decisive influence in the councils of their respective spheres, and having obtained this influence, become linked up with each other. This policy is being still further pursued in the endeavour to link up with Enver&apos;s activities and the Bolshevist movement. A study of our evidence reveals another very significant fact, namely that plans are already prepared ready for execution when a new society is brought into being or a party lends its allegiance to the general scheme. For instance when the Mouvahiddin Society was inaugurated in Sivas we find that certain stops had already been taken in anticipation of the resolutions it is about to pass, in other words it is an adjunct to a scheme already in being and is formed to help bring about a political &quot; coup &quot; to achieve which, other agencies have been in motion for some time.Again we see this in the negotiations on behalf of Feisal and Talaat Pasha, two conferences are sufficient to provide the means whereby he may hope to attain his ends and. though he does not fall in with the whole scheme when presented to him, in a tentative manner, other agencies are at work to bring this full co-operation about.Yet another important factor helping to prove the control of the movement by agencies outside Anatolia, Syria, and Baghdad, is the frequent references &quot;to await our instructions.&quot; The Vali of Daibekir instructs one &quot; Mishel &quot; to wait for a certain event Ajaimi Saadun when he displays anxiety to attack is told by the Minister of War at Constantinople to wait patiently for the time when he will be let loose. The tribes in Mesopotamia are instructed by the Mujtahids to arm themselves and await instructions. When we find in addition that the Nationalists and Syrian extremists and the various societies are linked up to Switzerland and from Switzerland to Berlin the,controlling forces are still further reduced. These we have yet to find. Because we find the threads leading to Berlin and Moscow it by no means proves that we have reached the end of our investigations, we have only commenced them.India Office.
