tho Property of: rv1aj3sty&apos;s Gty&apos;s Government.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.The Mesopotamia,!! Mandate.There is nothing much more irritating than a last moment contribution to a discussion from a Minister who is compelled to absent himself from that discussion ; but although my doctor forbids any movement for a fortnight, I am forced to ask that the Cabinet should not approve the Mesopotamia!! Mandate at present.I have nothing to say now as to its particular provisions. Of its kind it seems to me the best that the Foreign Office and the India Office in consultation could draw up. But I feel that it does define, precisely if not meticulously, our future responsibility in Mesopotamia. To do this at the present time I conceive to be disastrous, for the following reasons : (1) It launches us upon liabilities, the force and expenditure necessary to fulfil which nobody can forecast.(2) It will be intensely unpopular in this country. The country is beginning to realise, perhaps in their view too late, that we are limiting our liabilities in Mesopotamia by Sir Percy Cox&apos;s Mission and our efforts to form an Arab State. When they find that, stretching through the years, we have accepted internal and external responsibilities for Mesopotamia, the campaign against the Government on this head will break out afresh.(3) There is no necessity for it. We have accepted a Mandate for Mesopotamia, and I should have thought that, so far as the public is concerned, the more indefinite that word, is, the safer we are in our. ground. Let us leave the public, for the present at any rate, to believe what I must confess in the present circumstances is the policy that I favour, that the Mandate will be to form an Arab Government, and to relieve ourselves of all responsibility as quickly as possible.(4) I feel convinced that the Mandate will embarrass Sir Percy Cox. We have not yet abandoned wholly at any rate the possibility of Feisel as Amir. Supposing we found that Feisel would not accept the Amirate, or there was no prospect of its being workable if we controlled foreign relations in the form which the Mandate wishes us to control them. It might con-conceivably be possible to protect our interests by other methods, but we should have tied our hands.(5) It is almost superfluous to remind my colleagues that we have no money to spend in Mesopotamia; that we have no troops to send to Mesopotamia; that the Dominions have refused to help us there; that India, and I do not mean only the Indians but the soldiers in India, including, I believe, the new Commander-in-Chief and the Government of India, are demanding the return of Indian soldiers and warn us of grave political consequences if we try to enforce the Turkish peace by Indian mercenaries. There are troops in the old Turkish Empire who have not been relieved from the very early stages of the war.In these circumstances is it not rash to define the liabilities involved by our Mandate? If such a Mandate and such a programme are going to lead to the expenditure of more money, to the necessity of reinforcements &quot;or the maintenance of the present force, I, for one, would agree with the Secretary of State for War in demanding evacuation. For these reasons, and with great regret, I would urge with all my power the postponement of the decision of the Mandate until we have reports from Sir Percy Cox. If the Cabinet take my view, I will at once inform Sir Percy Cox tbat we are waiting to settle the terms of the Mandate, the draft of which he has seen, until we have a report from him.E. S.
