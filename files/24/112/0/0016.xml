PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.During the week the coal situation has passed from one crisis to another. The decision, on the 24th September, of the Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to suspend for one week their strike notices,, which otherwise would have takeiteffect on the 25th, was followed by conferences on the 25th, 27th, 28th and 29th between representatives of the miners&apos; executive and of the Mining Association of Great Britain. The suggestion, first tentatively advanced by the President of the Board of Trade on the 9th September, that the miners should meet the owners to discuss the possi-bility of making such a readjustment of remuneration in relation to output as might give a sufficient satisfaction of their wages demand, was thus acted upon. The particular object of these joint meetings was to discover an output datum line, on the determination of which depends the Prime Ministers offer of the 22nd September. On the 29th Sep-tember the joint conference decided that they could not arrive at an agreed recommendation to the Government, and the owners&apos; and the miners&apos; representatives reported separately their failure to arrive at an agreement which would settle the present dispute. The miners&apos; representatives on this date were of the opinion that no further good could accrue from continued meetings with the owners.The foul-monthly period for the operation of the last Awards of the Industrial Court for the engineering and shipbuilding industries will expire at the end of November. The trade unions concerned have already denounced the agreement of February, 1917, under which the periodic hearings have been held, and the Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades have now put forward an application for an increase in wages of %d. an hour for their members. Negotiations are also proceeding between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations with regard to such matters as payment for night shifts and overtime. The National Union of Eailwaymen have put before the Central Wages Board a claim for an additional 2s. per week for the men included in the conciliation grades under the sliding scale.The labour situation in its more political aspects is comparatively quiet. Attention is,being paid to the probable course of employment during the coming winter, and the local London Labour Parties, the National Union of Ex-Service Men, and the National Union of Police and Prison Officers apparently propose to exploit the unemployment in the docks area. As regards the cotton textile industry, it is probable that arrangements will be made between masters and men for organised curtailment of production. Details are given below of the arrangements agreed upon for this purpose in the Northampton boot and shoe trade.The Industrial Courts Act, 1919, continued until the 30th September, 1920, the legal force of prescribed and substituted rates of wages which had been fixed under the Wages (Temporary regulation) Acts, 1918-1919. On and after the 1st October, there-fore, rates of wages will be settled by negotiation between employers and employed, except in those cases where Statutory Orders apply,.such as Orders of the Agricultural Wages Boards and Orders under the Trade Boards Acts.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 17th September was 154,762, made up of 154,209 lodged by men and 553 by women. On the 10th September there were 150,972 policies current, 150,402 for men and 570 for women.On the 17th September, 99,583 unemployment books, 69,127 for males and 30,456 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Corn-pared with the previous week, when there were 63,728 books lodged by males and 28,778 by females, the total increase is 7,077.The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found&quot; on page 413.
General Topics.Labour and Ireland. The labour situation in Belfast remains unsettled. The con-ference, called by the management of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolf!, Ltd., to discuss the question of reinstating the workers expelled from the shipyards on the 21st July and on the following days, was held during the week, and the following resolution was passed by the representatives of the workers in the firm&apos;s employment: &quot; This conference, representative of the workers of Harland &amp; Wolff, declare that we will work with any workers irrespective of religion, putting them on their honour that they are not associated with Sinn Fein or any other disloyal organisation.&quot;By way&apos; of contrast, the executive committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, who, from the first, took a strong line on the question of the expulsions, have now issued strike notices withdrawing their members from all the workshops involved in order to obtain a general reinstatement of their boy-cotted members. They are endeavouring to force the issue by threatening to expel from the society all members who refuse to obey their in junction. It is reported, however, that, on the 27th September, a specially convened meeting of joiners, at which the men employed in all the shipbuilding and engineering firms affected by the notices were repre-sented, decided unanimously to remain at work, and to contest the legality of their executive counciFs action in the event of their expulsion from the society. A committee was appointed to watch the interests of the men.In view of recent alarmist statements, Mr. W. J. P. Wilson, secretary of the principal linen trade organisations (the Flax Spinners&apos; Association, Ltd., the Irish Power Loom Manufacturers&apos; Association, and the Household Linen and Piece Goods Association), has issued a public statement to the effect that, except in a very few instances, all the expelled workers in the linen trade of the city are now earning their livelihood under normal conditions.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. Joint committees of employers and employed in different sections of the cotton industry have for some time past been considering the question of preparing a special scheme which would enable the industry to contract out of the general scheme of unemployment insurance under this Act. On the 27th September, a sub-committee, representative of the employers and operatives, issued a brief statement intimating that there was every reason to believe that the cotton trade as a whole might contract out of the Unemployment Insurance Act on the lines laid down by the Act. No definite information of the progress made in evolving a scheme has been published.Education Act, 1918. A significant claim, indicative of the social reactions of the present employment relation in industry, has been put forward by the Coventry and District Engineering Employers&apos; Association in a deputation to the Coventry Education Committee, on the 22nd September, on the subject of the attendance of juvenile employees at continuation schools. The object of the deputation was to emphasise the employers&apos; view, that it was essential that they, as employers, should have representation on the sub-committee dealing with the provisions of the Education Act, 1918, so far as they related to continuation schools. The deputation stated that, if this committee&apos;s proposals were formulated without consultation with the employers, not only would industrial dislocation ensue, but the question of maintenance payment during attendance would in all probability be affected. It was eventually decided that the deputation should meet the technical and continuation schools sub-committee.Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment Bill). New developments have taken place with regard to the agitation aroused by Clause 2 of this Bill. As a reply to the passing of set resolutions by organised societies of workpeople, condemning the terms of the clause, actual tests of the opinion of women employees are being undertaken by some firms. For example, Messrs. Abram Lyle &amp; Sons, Ltd., Plaistow Wharf, issued a ballot paper to their 533 women employees, in which the advantages and disadvantages of the adoption of a double-shift system were set forth in detail. The result of the voting showed 472 in favour and 61 opposed. Meanwhile, it will be remembered that a departmental committee appointed by the Home Secretary are considering the whole question.Unemployment (London). Considerable activity is in evidence among the Labour elements in East London over the present unemployment situation. Attention was drawn last week to the resolutions passed by a conference at Deptford, on the 17th September,FEATURES OF THE WEEK.
 .10.20, 408Features of the Week-continued.of delegates from all the Metropolitan Boroughs. It is now reported that, at a mass meet-ing of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers at Shoreditch on the 27th September, the Labour Mayor of Shoreditch stated that the Labour Mayors of the London Boroughs intended to apply for permission to hold a demonstration on the unemployment question in Trafalgar Square, probably on the 13th October. At the third municipal conference of the London Labour Party, on the 25th September, a motion was passed urging the Labour Parties in each borough to demand town&apos;s meetings in every borough in London on the question of unemployment, and to be held, if possible, simultaneously.Cotton Textile Industry. The Emergency Committee Of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, Ltd., discussed, on the 28th September, the question of curtailing production in the spinning mills under their control. A resolution Was adopted, and afterwards confirmed by the General Committee of the Federation, recording the opinion that a curtailment of production both in the American and the Egyptian sections of the cotton spinning industry was desirable, but that a ballot of the members on the question should be deferred, pending a meeting between representatives of the federation and of the operatives&apos;- organisations, to discuss the details of such a curtailment.Boot and Shoe Industry. On the 21st September a joint meeting of &quot;employers and workers&apos; representatives in the boot and shoe industry was held at Northampton to consider the best method of dealing with the unemployment situation resulting from the depression in the boot trade. Under the rules of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, out of work benefit is paid only to members who have been definitely discharged; but a special scheme was inaugurated on the 21st June to provide out of work pay also to members temporarily unemployed for not less than a whole week. This scheme expired on the 26th September, and has been a severe drain on the union funds. It is understood that as a result of the joint meeting referred to above, actual discharges will in future be obviated so far as possible, and the situation dealt with by. the equalisation of short-time working among all the workpeople, the short time being arranged in regular and not alternate periods..Housing. Progress is reported in the building guild movement. The Manchester Building Guild, which may be said to have come into existence on the 20th January, have at last secured the acceptance of a contract by the Housing Committee of the Manchester Corporation. Mr. S. G. Hobson, the guild secretary, has recently been engaged at Leeds and Bradford in promoting the guild idea. At -Leeds, on the 21st September, he headed a deputation from the building operatives to the Leeds Improve-ments Committee to advocate the claim of the Leeds Building Guild to a contract for municipal housing. As a result of his endeavours, it was arranged to hold a special meeting on the 12th October, to give full consideration to the project. A building guild was also formed at Bradford on the 21st September, notwithstanding the difficulty of reconciling with the guild idea, the commitments of the building trade unions to the direct employment schemes of the Bradford Corporation. Mr. Hobson suggested certain lines of development whereby the guild could be brought into being and rendered effective without the invalidation of the direct employment contracts.In addition, it is now reported that the contract between the Walthamstow Council and the Guild of Builders (London), Ltd., has been finally accepted.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Transport Workers&quot; Federation. The result of the deliberations of the Triple Alliance on the coal situation last week was a pledge that the miners&apos; claims would be supported by the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, provided that these two organisations were allowed to participate in any negotiations with the Government which might take place before joint strike action became inevitable. In view of this pledge, and of the gravity of the situation, the General Council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation have issued a circular to their 36 affiliated trade unions asking for special powers to. enable them to fulfil, the obligations placed upon the federation as a constituent member of the Triple Alliance.This circular pointed out that the federation have long had in view a policy of can-solidation and amalgamation, which would give greater strength to the General Council and place them in a similar position to the Executive Council of the National Union of Railwaymen. Owing to the war, and to subsequent industrial difficulties, it had not been possible to proceed very far with this internal re-organisation.  The lack of cohesion
and executive power was, therefore, making itself felt at the present moment as it did during the railway crisis last year. The circular requested that the affiliated trade unions should reply by the 30th September, so as to enable the General Council to know exactly what would be their position at the meeting of the Triple Alliance which is summoned for that date.This circular, though clearly intended merely to meet the needs of the present situation, has a more permanent importance. At the annual conference of the federation at Swansea, in 1919, a resolution was passed instructing the executive of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation &quot; when in conference with the Triple Alliance, to refrain from committing the unions affiliated to the federation to strike action without a ballot vote being taken of the. unions concerned.&quot; The internal organisation of the federation was also discussed at the annual conference at Southampton, in 1920, but, at this meeting, emphasis was laid not so much upon the powers of the executive of the federation, as upon the need for further co-ordination of the constituent bodies of the federation, and the conference adopted a recommendation to the affiliated unions to proceed with amalgamation by groups. The seamen&apos;s unions who are brought closely together in the National Maritime Board are already considering proposals for closer working; a proposal has been mooted for the formation of one great dockers&apos; union; and unsuccessful negotiations for the amalgamation of the United Vehicle Workers and the National Union of Vehicle Workers have taken place. The circular once again brings into prominence the question of the powers of the executive, and. their desire to be &quot; in a similar position to the executive council of the National Union of Railwaymen.&quot;National Society of Pottery Workers.-The eleventh annual delegation of this society was held at Newcastle, Staffs, on the .18th September. - The address of the president, Mr. W. Aucock, was devoted chiefly to a general elaboration of the thesis that the economic security of the worker should be the first charge upon industry, and to a defence of the operatives&apos; present bonus demand.On the detailed consideration of the annual report, the only matter which aroused discussion was the paragraph stating that a special committee had been appointed to make recommendations ibo the new executive on the policy of the union with reference to the working of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The question was dropped, however, on the general secretary, Mr. T. Clowes, stating that the Trades Union Congress had decided not to administer the Act if friendly societies and insurance companies were allowed to do so, and that the society ought to honour that decision^The following significant resolution was passed on the subject of non-union labour : -&quot; That this delegation instructs the National Executive Council to take the necessary steps to organise a &apos; show card&apos; day periodically throughout the pottery industry, and to formulate some method to compel the non-unionists to join the society.&quot; In this connection it should be noted that, during the year ending the 30th June, 1920, the mem-membership of the society has increased from 35,000 to 45,000,, and this increase is largely independent of the members gained by the absorption during the past year of the United Ovenmen&apos;s Society and the United Potters&apos; Packers&apos; Labour Protection Association.It was decided to hold the next annual delegation at Derby.Labour and Co-operative Co-ordination-^lie first national conference of the political wing of the co-operative movement the Co-operative Party was held at Preston on the 16th September. The meeting was convened primarily to discuss the proposed Labour and Co-operative Political Alliance.f It also considered the general policy of the p irty and its relation to the Co-operative Union.In connection with the Alliance, the following resolution was adopted: &quot; That this conference strongly recommends all co-operative societies to support the establishment of a Labour and Co-operative Political Alliance, and to instruct their delegates to vote in favour of a scheme to be submitted to the next annual congress.&quot; Mr. S. F. Perry, secretary to the party, explained to the conference the position of the party in the co-operative movement, and outlined its future policy and organisation. Several of the delegates complained that the party would have no executive power as a political body while it remained a constituent of the Co-operative Union. It was contended, in reply, that the party is not hampered by its association with the central board of the Union,* Although the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress, on the 13th July, ;passed a resolution recom-mending societies to refuse to work the Act if societies other than trade unions were allowed to take part in its administration, it should be pointed out that similar resolutions which appeared in the agenda of the annual congress recently held at Portsmouth were not brought forward for discussion.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 199, and Vol. II, No. 9, 28bh August, p. 288.
t SeeReport of 7th August, 1920, p. 201.but has ample scope as an organisation representing the political aspirations of the whole co-operative movement.Officials of the paity will interview the directors of the Co-operative Wholesale Society on the 29th September to discuss the opposition of the directors to the proposed Political Alliance.The scope and possibilities of the Alliance were further discussed at four conferences arranged by the North-Western Sectional Board of the Co-operative Union, held on the 18th September at Barnsley, Bradford, Lancaster and Manchester. Members of the national council of the party explained in detail what the proposals were ; but no resolution was taken, the conferences being of an educational character and designed to familiarise co-operators with the scheme, so that they will be prepared to vote upon it at the Scar-borough Congress.National Farmers&apos; Union. The National Farmers&apos; Union have issued a statement explanatory of their labour policy. They deny the allegation that farmers contemplate discharges on an extensive and unnecessary scale &quot; out of spite.&quot; They claim, with refer-ence to the recent increase of the minimum wage rates for agricultural labour, that there is already evidence that discharges are taking place which are directly attributable to high labour costs, and state that, in the circumstances, there is a danger that economic pressure will render a certain amount of unemployment inevitable. On the other hand, in view of the probable industrial situation during the coming winter, the union are urging farmers to retain the largest possible proportion of their regular staffs.Trade Union Topics.Federation of Foremen&apos;s Associations. An important agreement has been arrived at between this federation and the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers. The agreement provides that in the event of an officially recog-nised dispute between either body and the employers, the union not affected by the dispute shall observe strict neutrality. In such circumstances, the members of the one union will not take the place, temporarily or otherwise, nor perform the duties of any member of the other union, and will not accept the supervision or instruction of any person who may be put in the place of such member. The agreement further provides that, in the event of members of either body being threatened with victimisation for observing the terms of the agreement, the executive councils shall confer with a view to taking joint action to safeguard the interests of the members concerned. Efforts will also be made to encourage foremen to join, or retain membership of, both organisations. The Federation of Foremen&apos;s Associations consists of the National Foremen&apos;s Association of Engineering and Allied Trades, the Amalgamated Managers and Foremen&apos;s Association, and the Scottish Foremen&apos;s Protective Association.Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Tiviners. The quarterly representative meeting of this association was held on the 28th September, at Manchester. The most important item under consideration was the proposal emanating from the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association (of which the Amalgamated Association is an affiliated body) for the reorganisation of that association as a complete political and industrial federation of all trade unions in the Lancashire cotton textile industry; and the decision of the meeting was against the proposal. It will be remembered that there was evidence of considerable opposition to this proposal at the annual meeting of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association on the 26th and 27th July lastf ; but that it was finally decided that the opinion of the constituent bodies should be ascertained for the consideration of a special conference on the 13th November.Bank Officers&apos; Guild. The annual general meeting of the Bank Officers&apos; Guild. (Foreign Banks Branch) was held on the 23rd September, at Winchester House, London, Mr. E. J. Purnell presiding. The chairman stated that although they were demanding for those engaged in foreign banks a wage which was actually lower than the scale paid in British banks their demand was refused. A resolution calling upon the British Bankers&apos; Associa-tion to collaborate with the guild in the establishment of a &quot; Whitley Council &quot; for the banking profession was carried unanimously.Ex-Service Men.National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers. The general secretary of this federation has announced that the ballot of individual members,
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (Dublin). A demand for increased wages has been put forward in the Dublin building trades, and a strike is threatened to take place on the 2nd October. It is understood that the employers have refused to consider the claim, and a strike is, therefore, probable.Coal Miners (National). The situation became considerably easier at the end of last week, when it was agreed to suspend the strike notices for one week to enable repre-sentatives of the coalowners and the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation to confer on. the question of output and the basing of future wage increases on increased production.Sir Robert Horne&apos;s proposal to institute an immediate inquiry into this question, on lines which would ensure an increase of wages to the miners, provided that agreement with the coalowners as to a datum line was speedily reached, was amplified by the Prime Minister at the conference with the deputation from the Triple Alliance on the 22nd September, and also in correspondence which passed between him and the miners&apos; executive on the following day.At the resumed conference of the Triple Alliance on the 23rd September, and at the second delegate meeting of the Miners&apos; Federation on the same day, this proposal was apparently not very fully considered. Several delegates urged the acceptance of the other proposal, namely, to submit the wages claim to an impartial Court of Inquiry, and it was proposed that a fresh ballot of the members should be taken on this. This suggestion was rejected, however, on a card vote, in spite of the fact that it had Mr. SmilhVs support, as well as that of the delegates of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association.On the 24th September, all three sections of the Triple Alliance requested an interview with the Prime Minister. The conference with the miners resulted in their con-senting to postpone the strike notices for one week, within which period they would explore the possibility of a settlement along the lines of the output proposal. Further negotiations were, therefore,. suspended pending this investigation.  A committee of theordered by the annual conference held in London on the 23rd May, on the question of affiliation to any political party, has resulted in a very heavy majority against such affilia-tion. This result should prevent the raising of any further serious obstacle to the present movement for unification now nearing realisation.Employment of Ex-Service Men. In furtherance of the national campaign for the resettlement of ex-Service men, the Minister, on the 24th September, addressed meetings at Middlesbrough and Newcastle.International Relations of LabounInternational Labour Office. The third meeting of the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation of the League of Nations will take place at Geneva in April, 1921.  The agenda is as follows: (1) Reform of constitution of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office. (2) Agricultural questions : (a) The adaptation of the Washington decisions to agricultural labour :(i) Regulation of the hours of work ;(ii) Measures for the prevention of, and providing against, unemployment;(iii) The protection of women and children.(b) Technical agricultural education.(c) Living-in conditions of agricultural workers.(d) Guarantee of the rights of association and combination.(e) Protection against accident, sickness, invalidity and old age.(3) (a) Disinfection of wool infected with anthrax spores.(6) Prohibition of the use of white lead in painting. (4) The weekly rest day in industrial and commercial employment.(5) (a) The prohibition of the employment of any person under the age. of 18 years as trimmer or stoker ; (6) Compulsory medical examination of all children employed on board ship.t
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.coalowners was appointed immediately by the Mining Association of Great Britain, and meetings were held at the Board of Trade on the 25th, 27th, 28th and 29th September. The owners&apos; committee was composed as follows: Mr. Evan Williams, president of the Mining Association of Great Britain, Lord Gainford, Sir Adam Nimmo, Mr. J. G. Forgie, Col. Mitchell, Col. Harrison and Sir Thomas RatclifEe Ellis, secretary of the Mining Association of Great Britain.  The miners were represented by their full executive.At the conclusion of the meetings on the 29th September, it was reported that no agreement could be reached on the datum line. The coalowners offered to make this datum line 242,000,000 tons, a figure midway between the output for the March and June quarters, but the miners wished the datum line to be the ascertained output for the September quarter. The datum line put forward by the owners was to carry an immediate increase of Is. per day: that put forward by the miners, an increase of 2s. per day to * date back to the 14th July. The Prime Minister was informed of the result of the meetings by the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation who will report to their delegate conference on the 30th September. The deadlock created by the failure of the joint negotiations between the miners and the coalowners has brought about a situation similar to that which existed in the middle of last week.Objections to the action of the Federation in adopting the Prime Ministers proposal have been made by the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, who, at a delegate conference held at Cardiff on the 29th September, passed a resolution to the effect that the workers&apos; claim should be pressed before any question of output is considered.Engineers (National). The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades have put forward an application for an increase in wages to their members of 6d. an hour.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Furniture Trade Workers (Leeds District). The strike of furniture workers, which began on the 14th June, is not yet settled, although an understanding has now been reached on the question of the discharge of blacklegs and the calculation of overtime. A con-ference was held on the 15th September, when the Bradford men accepted the terms and work was resumed on the 20th September. The men remain on strike in York demand-ing to be paid the Leeds rate of 2s. Xd. an hour as against their own rate of 2s. ld*Vehicle Builders (National). A strike of vehicle builders employed in all firms in the National Federation of Vehicle Trades j began on the 27th September to enforce a demand for an increase of 6d. an hour. In London the non-federated firms have agreed to pay the new rates, and in certain provincial towns both federated and non-federated firms have made a similar settlement. The men on strike number between 5,000 and 6,000. The employers wish to introduce a system of payment by results, but this is strongly resisted by the men.Settlements and Agreements.Cotton Spinners (Oldham). A settlement of the unauthorised strike of spinners, which took place in the Oldham district on the 15th September, as a protest against the mule staffing agreement, is now in sight. During last week several of the mills whose employees were on strike applied to the Oldham Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association for permission to re-open, as the men were willing to come back. At a joint meeting between the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association and the Oldham Operative Spinners&apos; Association, held on the 28th September, it was agreed that the mills should re-open on the 5th October, and that all the strikers should be recommended to resume on that date. The union in the meantime will have under consideration any objections to the creeler agreement which may be formulated at special district meetings and communicated to the executive through the usual official channels.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Departments section of the Report, pp. 426 to 428.]* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 9 ; Vol. II, No. 11,11th September, p. 339. j See also p. 427 below.

The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 723 as regards men, and an increase of 71 in respect of women. All divisions except the South-Western report increases in the men&apos;s register, and all except the Northern, Wales and Ireland Divisions in the women&apos;s register.Men&apos;s Employment.Shipbuilding and Other Industries. The position in the shipbuilding and allied industries has undergone little change. A shortage of material is still adversely affecting employment in a number of shipbuilding centres in Scotland. At Clydebank the prospects, as regards the shipyard workers, have been much improved by the settlement of the dispute between the platers and their helpers. The situation in Coatbridge and district is regarded as very satisfactory. At Galashiels employment is also good, and surplus labour is in the main confirmed to unskilled workers. The demand at Greenock for coopers, shipwrights and ironmoulders remains urgent. The situation on the Tyne and Wear remains practically the same. The demand for labour is very small, and great difficulty is experienced in placing applicants. On the Tees, however, employment continues to be fairly good, and West Hartlepool report activity in ship-repairing work.The North-Western Division report that the industrial position must still be regarded as disquieting. But for the settlement of the electrical and printing trade disputes, the general position would have been extremely gloomy. The threatened. coal strike is causing widespread uneasiness, and is resulting in increased unemployment in many trades which were already quiet. The slackness in the cotton trade appears to have become more acute, and is giving much concern to local authorities in certain districts. Hitherto, the mills in the Oldham district have been active, notwithstanding the general depression in the industry. The sudden development, however, of a trade dispute in that area has resulted, it is understood, in a stoppage of work in 200 mills.At Denton the hatting industry is on short time, and local firms are suffering in competition with American firms, who appear to have captured the Canadian markets.The depression in the leather, lace, silk and jute trades still continues, and the position in the boot and shoe trade is reported as steadily becoming worse.Industrial Developments.-Worthing report that a firm of cork manufacturers intend opening the Yapton Aerodrome in the course of a month or two. A new fustian factory has been opened at Nantwich.  At Swansea,.Messrs. Topham, Jones &amp; Railton, Ltd., are
Employment Department-continued.building a new patent fuel works at King&apos;s Dock, which, it is stated, will be the largest in Europe, and will probably employ about 750 men.A new waterway at the silk factory of Messrs. Courtaulds, Ltd., Halstead, has been started ; 24 men, including 14 ex-Service men, have been engaged. The Portsmouth Town Council have decided that an extension of the esplanade in front of Eastney Barracks shall be started immediately. The Admiralty have agreed that the Council shall take over the responsibility for the sea wall. The Council also propose to construct a new road through the barracks at an estimated cost of between  40,000 and  50,000.Shortage of Labour. The position in London in regard to carpenters, joiners, brick-layers and plasterers is still unchanged. Very few men in these occupations are coming forward for registration, and the number of vacancies is large. The painting and decorating trade, however, is now undergoing a period of depression. Applicants of the general labouring type are difficult to place.There is still a shortage of moulders of all classes, motor-body builders, woodcutting machinists, wagon repairers and quarrymen.Labour Reductions.- There have been further discharges by Messrs. Tilling-Stevens Motors Ltd., Maidstone, and by Messrs. Harper Bean, Ltd., Tipton, due to slackness in the motor trade. Bristol report that nearly 1,000 workmen have received notice from the Douglas Motors, Ltd.Slwrtage of Material. At Walsall, firms in the ironfounding industry are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining supplies of raw material. At Edinburgh the shortage of cement is affecting employment in the building trade.Women&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation. Little change is indicated in the industrial situation. The depression in the textile trade continues to affect most of the manufacturing districts of the North-Western and Yorkshire and East Midlands Divisions. In most of the English textile towns additional mills are being closed indefinitely, and holiday periods are being extended. Steady trade, however, is still reported at Worksop, Sowerby Bridge, Todmorden and Wakefield. It is understood that the Yorkshire fustian manufacturers are considering the advisability of reducing output by 25 per cent, from the 4th October. They are not prepared to carry heavy stocks, owing to the large amount of capital involved.The Scottish textile industries remain unsettled, and short time continues to be worked ; on the other hand the textile trade at Galashiels, Butherglen and Selkirk remains steady.  The jute trade continues slack at Dundee, owing to the shortage of raw material.The strike of plain lace net workers in the East Midland districts is still hampering the lace trade, and discharges and short-time working are reported from Basford, Beeston, Derby and Ilkeston, Long Eaton and Nottingham.A growing slackness in the leather trades is reported from Armley, Workington and Hackney, Shoreditch, Bermondsey and Leyton.Hosiery work in the South Midlands and Eastern Division is slack, but, as in Beeston, Derby and Ilkeston, very little actual unemployment has been experienced in this trade up to the present.In the wholesale clothing, blouse and underwear trades, increasing depression is being felt in Braintree, Colchester and Oxford. Other areas specially affected are Hebden Bridge, Leeds, Armley, York, Barnsley, Basingstoke, Portsmouth and Swindon. Glasgow also report a growing surplus of workers in these trades.The West Midland engineering and metal-working centres, Birmingham, Handsworth, Hockley, Selly Oak and Tipton, all show increasing unemployment. The jewellery trade, however, has improved slightly, though there appears no immediate prospect of a marked revival. Cradley Heath, Dudley, Worcester and Stourbridge continue to place a certain number of unskilled wromen as hop-pickers. The shortage of buffers and burnishers for the Sheffield cutlery trade is again the subject of comment.The South Midland Division report that many of the women discharged from engineering firms at Cambridge and Chelmsford have re-started. The position of women tinplate workers in Wales has slightly improved during the week, further women having been placed at Blaenau Festiniog and Neath.In the Potteries, trade is comparatively brisk, but vacancies are not easily filled owing to the highly specialised nature of many of the processes.Factory work in London continues to be very slack, and surplus factory workers, both skilled and unskilled, are registered in all districts.  Canning Town, Wood Green,
Employment Department-continued.and Leyton, report abnormal unemployment among confectionery workers; Brixton, the City, East Ham, Great Marlborough Street, Hackney, Shoreditch and Stratford, in the needlework trades; and Deptford, Hackney, Shoreditch and Bermondsey, in the tin box making industry.Scotland also report a surplus of general factory workers, especially in the Glasgow, Aberdeen and Clydebank areas. Potato lifting, hop-picking and flax pulling continue to provide temporary employment for unskilled workers in many parts of the country, and forestry workers have been placed in several districts of Argyllshire.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Procedure.-The Bury Committee have passed a resolution that, when future appoint-ments of chairmen for Courts of Referees are considered, the Local Employment Committee should be consulted and should, have some voice in their selection.Employment.-Bermondsey have resolved that, in any scheme which may be authorised for the relief of unemployment in the borough, all labour required should be obtained through the local Employment Exchange.The Watford Employment Committee have passed a resolution requesting the Ministry of Health to institute an inquiry as to the conditions of labour under which a local housing-scheme was being carried out, and an intimation has been received from the Ministry that the matter is under consideration.Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance. The Leigh Committee are of opinion that no written statement from an employer, as to the reasons for which employ-ment terminated, should be accepted unless the employer is prepared to substantiate it by appearing personally in court.Training. The Enfield Committee are of the opinion that in most occupations a trainee should have at least two years&apos; training, and that his wages during his employment as an improver should be made up to at least the amount which he received as allowances during his period of training.Ex-Service Men. The Kendal Committee have decided to obtain from local employers on the King&apos;s Roll a quarterly return of the percentage of disabled ex-Service men in their employment, and recommended that a revised list of those qualified for the Roll should be advertised in the local newspapers.The East Ham Committee have requested the East Ham and Barking Councils to receive a deputation on the provision of employment for disabled ex-Service men on the local register. They also recommend that the Minister of Pensions be asked to revise his staff, in order that a larger percentage of ex-Service men may be employed.Miscellaneous. The Guildford Committee have protested against the continued retention of the Oxshott brickworks as a shell dump, and have asked that the Minister of Health should hold an inquiry into the possibility of reopening brickyards in Surrey.The Lowestoft Women&apos;s Sub-Committee continue to give consideration to the pro-vision of adequate accommodation for fishing workers during the coming season. Two private houses have been offered for the purpose.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made.-Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 16th September, show 729 payments to civilian workers, and 153,589 to ex-members of the Forces. The total amount disbursed to date is  22,403,044 to civilian workers and  32,965,464 to ex-members of the Forces.Ex-Service Men Discharged after the 31st July-Out-of-work donation policies, issued to men discharged from H.M. Forces subsequent to the 31st July, 1920, have not been valid beyond the 6th November, 1920.. It has now been decided that, in the case of men serving on duration of war attestations, with certain minor exceptions, policies valid for 12 months shall be issued, and that the validity of policies already issued to such men shall be extended to 12 months after the date of discharge.
2.10.20. 416Employment Department-continued.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 10th September amounted to  20,842 2s. Id.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 22nd September, 20,570 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 241,676 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller of the South Midlands and Eastern Division reports that an appeal to over a thousand farmers in the county has been made by the secretary of the Suffolk County Association. So far, 14 undertakings have been received. A further appeal by the Lord Lieutenant of the county is in preparation.A letter has been sent to all the more important golf clubs in Great Britain, inviting them to co-operate. A scheme whereby caddies at Walton Heath are guaranteed a certain sum per week was described in detail.Platings.At Grays, an applicant, suffering from severe wounds in both legs, who has also lost his right eye, has been placed as a handyman with a large oil firm, at the local labourer&apos;s rate.The Reading Exchange report the placing of an applicant, with both legs amputated below the knee, as an under-gardener.At Bedford, an offer has been made by a local manufacturer of sports goods to train three one-legged men in football making, and a suitable scheme is being prepared.Sixteen disabled men have been placed as caddies with a Scottish golf club. Although the club are unable to guarantee a wage, the caddies are engaged by individual members, and earn on the average 54s. per week.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Apprenticeship (Buildingj-Tke scheme of apprenticeship prepared by the Industrial Council for the Building Industry has been considered by four more Juvenile Employment Committees. The Chesterfield Committee, as a result, have offered to co-operate with the District Council of the Industrial Council. The Kings Lynn and Leicester Committees are arranging to discuss the scheme with representatives of employers and workpeople. At Romford the committee held a meeting with representatives of employers and work-people, at which a representative of the Industrial Council explained the scheme in detail, A resolution was passed expressing the great desirability of establishing a Building Trades Apprenticeship Committee for the Romford area, and the matter is now being submitted to the various trade organisations concerned.Juveniles from Outlying Areas.-The Plymouth Juvenile Advisory Committee have recently considered a proposal to extend their activities to the whole of the area covered by the 21 Branch Employment Offices attached to the Plymouth Exchange. Local sub-committees of the Plymouth Employment Committee have already been formed in connection with most of these Branch Offices, and it was suggested that one member should be added to each of these sub-committees to deal specially with juveniles. The committee approved the proposal in principle, and details are now being worked out in consultation with the education authority. Similar proposals have been approved by the Exeter Juvenile Advisory Committee.[Reference to matters of, interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 407, 408, 410, 418, and 421 to 425.]

The Director at Edinburgh reports that many works in the Glasgow area are making considerable staff reductions. In one case, that of a large agricultural implement manufacturing firm, 200 employees were dismissed last week.At Carlisle, the Mayor has agreed to place before the General Purposes Committee of the Town Council a proposal to form a Civic Committee to press home, as a local obligation, the absorption of every unemployed ex-Service officer and man in the city.In connection with the recent letter addressed by the Chamber of Commerce to the various employers&apos; associations and federations in the Birmingham district, the managing directors of these associations from wrhom a reply was not received were personally visited during the week by a representative of the department. Promises of practical assistance were forthcoming in most cases.The Director at Cambridge reports that vacancies in the engineering trades are increasingly difficult to obtain. Many of the larger firms continue to experience difficulty in meeting contracts, owing to the general uncertainty with respect to the cost of materials and labour.There is a great shortage of vacancies in the London Directorate.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments Department will also be found on page 410.]TRAINING DEPARTMENT.EX-SERVICE MEN.General.Statistical. On the 22nd September, 25,102 men were in training, as against 24,798 on the 15th September and 24,099 on the 28th July. On the 22nd September there were 18,984 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 15th September and the 28th July being 19,597 and 21,772 respectively. On the 22nd September, the number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 16,820, the totals for the 15th September and the 28th July being 16,422 and 13,812 respectively.The figures show a distinct improvement upon those of recent weeks. The waiting list, which is now under 19,000, stood at the beginning of February at over 28,000. During the week there were nearly 400 terminations of training. Including the men who termination-nated their training under the Ministry of Pensions, estimated at 11,000, nearly 30,000 men have now completed a course under the Government scheme. The number of cases dealt with under the Ministry of Labour since the 1st August, 1919, is approximately 41,000.Keports from the Divisional Directors on work during August are generally satis-factory. It is clear that the provision of training facilities is now fairly adequate in most divisions, although in a good many instances there is still much to be done in the provision of equipment and in constructional work. The discovery of improvers&apos; vacancies is becoming increasingly difficult; the appointment, however, of special mobile training officers in certain divisions is proving valuable in this connection. The uncertainty of the labour outlook enhances the difficulty, as it makes employers chary of accepting men for definite periods.
APPRENTICES AND BOYS. INTERRUPTED APPRENTICESHIPS.Questions Affecting the Scheme.Wages. Cases of the under-payment of individual apprentices under the scheme continue ; but difficulty in determining the prescribed rate seems at least partially responsible. Messrs. Walton &amp;- Co., London, printers, interpret the prescribed rate to be the rate prevailing when the apprentice was brought under the scheme. They claim to pay on this basis throughout his renewed apprenticeship, ignoring any subsequent increases.Owing to the long absence of the proprietor on military service, the business of the Hexham Herald was practically bankrupt. Before the war only union men were employed, and the union concerned agreed that, until the business was again on a sound footing, their members would work at a weekly rate of 65s., forgoing any bonuses or advances grantedEx-Service Men-continued.Block Printing (Flannels).-As the industry is supposed to be a dying one, the fact that the department are giving consideration to a proposal for training disabled men in the block printing of flannels, for universities and colleges, constitutes a distinct departure from usual practice. It is, however, believed that the present condition of the industry is due solely to a shortage of skilled men, and that there are possibilities of a revival should a supply of trained disabled men become available.Building Trades. The department have under consideration a proposal from the Board of Education to start an evening class at one of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s training centres, for the voluntary attendance of men in training at the centre in the building trades. It is suggested that instruction should be given in the theory of building, which, it is believed, will not only be of great assistance on the purely trade side of the work, but may also assist the men to find posts as teachers of building subjects.Government Instructional Factories. During the past few weeks several Government Instructional Factories have materially increased the number of men in training. At Sarisbury Court there are now 3.17 men, and at Birtley 373. At New Basford and Cardiff the totals now stand at 240 and 378.At the new Claydon Factory a volunteer fire brigade-is being formed. A library which has been formed will be a valuable asset during the winter in this somewhat remote centre.At Sarisbury Court the carpentry section have been employed on furnishing the cubicles, and cutting out the floors for the stores in the training college section, and also in making benches for their own shop. The plumbers have been running and fitting the lead pipes for the science tables in the training college. . Other men in the building trades have been engaged on various forms of adaptation work.Work at Ponders End, Guildford and Norwich will be started within the next few weeks. The Kirkdale Factory, Liverpool, has now come on to the active list, a course of training in watch and clock repairing having been started.Equipment and Supplies-Divisional Directors have been notified-/that a sufficient supply of tool kits for the boot and shoe trade is now available at the Central Stores, and that all further orders for such kits should be sent to headquarters. Deliveries to the Central Stores during the week include bricklaying tools, a large quantity of woodworking tools, a consignment of tool kits for all trades, sewing machines, motor lorry accessories, and machinery.Treasury Sanctions.Since the issue of the last Report the following is the most important of a number of proposals that have received Treasury sanction.The supply to each Government Instructional Factory of not more than one motor lorry, at a cost not exceeding  650, subject to approval by a departmental committee of the Ministry of Labour after a review of the circumstances of the factory.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week 10 schemes, providing 187 places, have been sanctioned. Included in this number are 42 places for training in various branches of the furniture trade.
Apprentices and Boys-continued.in the meantime. This was done for 18 months. The proprietor now asks to base his payments under the scheme on a rate of 65s., and the union agree to this as the rate for the district.Paxjment of State Grant-Some objection is being taken in the printing industry at Leeds and Bradford to the provision of. the printing scheme for payment of State grant at 19 instead of 21 ; and the question of not bringing apprentices under it until the latter age has been raised. The reasons put forward are that lads returning at a little over 19 will be in a similar position to men of 23 or 24, and that there is likely to bo trouble with ordinary apprentices, as well as with the older ex-Service men. The local officials of the Typographical Association apparently concur in these views.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics. Up to the 22nd September, 41 schemes had been approved. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 13th September, was 251, making a total of 44,122. The number of applications received from apprentices was 283, making a total of 49,579.Up to the 22nd September, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 42,591 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 40,931 apprentices, employed by 16,188 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 10,637.Applications. In the Northern area considerable progress is reported in providing for apprentice applicants who have been unable to find employers. Their numbers had been reduced to 32 by the 21st August, and local headquarters are making great efforts to get this remainder absorbed. Some of the large shipbuilding firms have been approached, and promises to provide for some of the apprentices have already been secured.In the South Midlands and Eastern area, local headquarters are specially approaching firms known to be favourable to the scheme, to make provision for one such apprentice or more. In view of housing difficulties, firms in the immediate neighbourhood of the apprentices&apos; homes will first be approached, but later on it may be necessary to provide for some of them at a greater distance.Acceptance or Non-Acceptancc-In. the Edinburgh plumbing trade applications are not yet coming in rapidly, either from employers or apprentices. The secretaries both of the employers&apos; and of the operatives&apos; associations have been asked to press their members to expedite matters. Recent reports from Dundee are by no means favourable, though a few applications continue to come through. In the engineering industry, federated firms still refuse to bring further apprentices under the scheme, until their points of difference with the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation are adjusted, but a few apprentices in this industry are still being brought under the scheme by non-federated firms. The arbitration in the plumbing industry,* which was expected to have a favourable effect in Dundee, has not yet led to any move on the part of the employers to adopt the scheme, nor apparently, is it likely to do so.Training in Operation.&quot; Progress. Further evidence is forthcoming that the depart-menfs inspections of training are regarded with favour. A recent inquiry in regard to training in the Scottish ironfounding industry was welcomed by all but one of the firms visited. At Norwich, a number of firms expressed themselves favourably regarding visits by representatives of the department.Termination of Agreements. Messrs. Lawrence &amp; Co., Colwick, furniture manufac-turers and body builders, have been compelled to discharge a number of apprentices. Owing to slackness they have largely reduced their staff, and the trade unions concerned insisted that the due proportion of apprentices to journeymen should still not be exceeded. They have promised, however, to reinstate the apprentices as soon as circumstances permit.Institutional Training. Sufficient students have now come forward to enable classes to be established at the Robert Gordon Technical College, Aberdeen, and the Heriot Watt College, Edinburgh. The difficulty in completing the classes was due largely to the reluctant-tance of the apprentices to forgo the higher wages of workshop training, even when they were being periodically suspended. This attitude is especially marked in Edinburgh, where the required numbers were only secured by applications from Kirkcaldy.Applications for training are increasing in the London and South-Eastern area, and so far all have been satisfactorily met.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 216.
4217.0.20.Apprentices and Boys--continued.GENERAL TRAINING.Apprenticeship (Building). Further inquiries, in connection with the national scheme drawn up by the Joint Industrial Council for the building industry, indicate that employers generally are favourable to a revival of indentured apprenticeship. Difficulty, however, in launching the scheme is expected in the South-Western area, outside certain important centres, such as Bristol, Gloucester and Southampton. This is due partly to the fact that apprentices&apos; wages are lower than in other areas, and partly to incomplete trade organisation. Many employers are outside the federation, and many operatives, particularly in Cornwall, do not belong to a trade union.A recent conference upon conditions in the industry in East Kent recommended a State grant of 55. per week during the first two years of apprenticeship, and State grant! towards the purchase of tools in cases of genuine hardship. It was also suggested that manual training, bearing on their future trade, should be given to intending apprentices during the final period of their elementary school life.At Bakewell not only are no lads becoming apprenticed to various outdoor building trades, but journeymen are leaving them to take labourers&apos; work. The latter entails, apparently, much less loss of time owing to bad weather, and no outlay for tools is required. The difference between journeymen&apos;s and labourers&apos; wages is small.Welfare Work (Wales).-The institution of a welfare scheme for the Rhymney Valley has recently been considered by a representative meeting. At this it was decided to approach the various miners&apos; lodges in the district to secure their financial support.[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department will also be found on pages 407, 410, 415, 416 awd 418.]INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: REPORTS.Building.-T]ie Resettlement Committee received official notification of the accept-ance by the Cabinet Committee on Housing of their amended memorandum of proposals for augmenting the supply of labour and accelerating output. The committee subsequently discussed the method by which the scheme could best be put into operation through the , agency of the trade unions concerned. Difficulties, however, arose as to the correct inter-pretation of the Government^ acceptance of the proposals, and it was necessary to arrange a meeting with the Minister of Health and the principal housing officers of his department.The committee undertook to endeavour to formulate a provisional scheme for the compensation of operatives prevented from working through stress of weather, on the understanding that any such scheme, if approved by the Ministry of Health, would immediately be made a charge upon housing schemes.  The efforts of the committee to come to an understanding were unsuccessful.  The offer of the employers to recommend payment on the lines of the Hereford Award,* increased to 50 per cent, of time lost, was not acceptable to the operatives, who were not prepared to recommend acceptance of less than 75 per cent, of such time.  The representative of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society stated that the London executive of his union had recently passed a resolution to this effect, in view of which it was impossible for them to consider a less favourable offer. It is thought that the operatives&apos; terms may be based upon the belief that the Govern-ment are prepared to stand by their original offer of a guaranteed week, notwithstanding that the trade are not prepared to work the longer week required under the Government scheme, or to accept payment by results.  This assumption appears to be based upon a misunderstanding which arose during the earlier sitting, and will probably be dealt with jn separate reports, to be issued by the employers and operatives respectively.* An award by Mr. W. H. Stoker, on the 2nd December, 1916, in respect of differences arising during the construction of the Hereford National Filling Factory.
Cablemaking. The Council met&apos; on the 22nd September. The Negotiating Com-mittee reported the revision of rates for girls between 14 and 18 years of age, by the payment of a service bonus of Is. per week, per year of service, to date from the first pay-day in October. A probationary period of one month for women workers was fixed during which time they are to receive \d. per hour less than the standard rates. It was decided not to include wire drawers, die setters and annealers in the schedule of operations covered by the recent agreement.The Council decided not to arbitrate in the case of a strike among navvies digging trenches for cables at Nelson.Electricity Supply.-The District Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire met on the 22nd September. An application was made by the trade union side for a further advance in wages. As no agreement could be reached, it was decided that the matter be referred to the National Council for decision.Gas, The Executive Committee met on the 23rd September. A model constitution for works committees drafted by the employers&apos; side was considered, but further consideration was deferred to a special meeting at an early date. The National Council met on the same day. The trade union side pressed that the adoption of a constitution for works committees should be expedited. Reports as to zoneing and grading by District Councils, on the basis of a scheme agreed upon by a sub-committee representative of both sides of the National Council, were received from several District Councils. It was decided not to consider them before all the schemes adopted had been received;Hosiery. A conference was&apos; held on the 23rd September between members of the Council and officers of the Employment Department to discuss informally the industry&apos;s draft special scheme for contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act.Local Authorities&apos;&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers [England and Wales).&apos;  The District Council for Northumberland and Durham met on the 17th September. Replies to a circular letter to local authorities in the area asking for a statement of intention to abide by the decisions of the Council were considered. It was decided that authorities who had replied negatively, or who had not replied, should be invited to send repre-sentatives to a conference with the employers&apos; side of the Council. The District Council for Essex, Hertfordshire and Middlesex met on the 20th September. The report of the executive committee, embodying a grading scheme for the area and minimum rates of pay, was approved; the scheme is to become operative as from, the first full pay-day following the 1st July.The District Council for the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire met on the 23rd September. Schedules of zones and grades and minimum rates for the area were approved. The District Council for the South Midlands Area met on the 24th September. It was decided that the Committee on Grading should meet on the 11th October to consider the fixing of minimum rates of wages for categories of workers, including women, not at present provided for in the grading scheme.Needle, Fish-hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Council met on the 21st September. A report of the Wages Committee, classifying the various operations con-nected with the industry in three grades, was unanimously adopted. Grading cards will be issued by the trade unions concerned, and the adjustment of wages will be made retrospective as from the first pay-day in May. A further protest against the prevalence of home-work was made by the trade unions, and it was agreed that the works committees should take steps to check the practice as far as possible.Pottery, A special meeting of the Council was held on the 23rd September to consider the application for increased wages made by the National Society of Pottery Workers, in respect of which strike notices to expire on the 30th September had been given. After protracted discussion, a sub-committee was appointed of equal numbers of representatives of employers and employees, with an independent chairman.

The chief business was the consideration of an application for an increased minimum rate of pay to day-workers in the South West England Area, which had been refused by the employers&apos; side of the District Joint Council for that area. The appeal to the National Council was made in accordance with Clause 7 of the constitution, which states that no strike or lock-out shall take place until the matter has been considered by the National Council. After representatives of both parties had stated their case, the Council unanimously decided to recommend an increase of Id. per hour as from the 1st November, and a further increase of Id. per hour as from the 1st February, 1921 ; that no further application for a general increase in wages shall be made before the 31st August, 1921 ; and that any departure from this settlement due to abnormal circumstances in any particular quarry shall be referred to the Area Council for settlement.Wool (and Allied) Textiles.

(Award No. 482.)AGREEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS.Coppersmiths (Dundee).-One of the clauses of an agreement negotiated by the Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, between Messrs. McAra &amp; Sons and their workers, provided that, if any system of payment of results were instituted, it should be a system of collective piece-work.Building Trades Operatives (Tunbridge Wells). The strike of building trades operatives at Tunbridge Wells has been settled. With the object of dispensing with working one hour overtime per day, the working hours were so arranged that 44 hours were worked from Monday to Friday inclusive, and the job was closed on Saturday. The chief objection of the operatives appeared to be to the somewhat arbitrary tone of the notice, and it was thought that they should have been consulted before the notice was posted. On the 16th September, a meeting of the operatives and employers was held and a settlement was reached under the terms of which Messrs. Jarvis, Ltd., agreed to withdraw their notice. On the 17th September all the men had resumed work.Women Metal Workers (London). A conference of representatives of Messrs. Witchell &amp; Co., Ltd., and the National Federation of Women Workers, to discuss a question as to
Wages and Arbitration Department-continued,the payment of the prescribed rate, was held at Montagu House. The firm agreed to pay to their employees who are members of the Federation a total sum of  76 in full settlement of the claim.Urban District Clerical Staff (Pontypridd). At a conference of the parties arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer, and held on the 20th September, an agreement was reached providing that a meeting of the &quot; Whitley &quot; District Council should be held on the 21st September to reconsider the situation; that this Council should submit the whole position to a meeting of the Pontypridd Urban District Council on the 28th September, when the secretary of the National Association of Local Government Officers would put forward the clerks&apos; case; and that any scale of wages agreed to should be retrospective to the 1st July.Corporation Workers (Swansea). The clerks employed by the Corporation have resumed work, on the promise that a deputation will be received by the Council and their grievances inquired into.Clogmakers (Smith). The employees have accepted the terms offered, and have returned to work. It is possible that they may, in the course of a few weeks, make an application for 3d. per hour increase, as a similar application has been made to other firms in the clog sole industry.COMMITTEES, CONFERENCES AND DEPUTATIONS.Royal Glasgow Asylum of the Blind. Mr. J. B. Baillie, O.B.E., was appointed to inquire into certain allegations made by the National League of the Blind. Mr. Baillie reported that the allegations of apathy as regards the workers&apos; welfare brought against the managers had not been established, except in respect of the indefinite arrangements for, and lack of system in, the training of apprentices, and of the attitude of the Board of Management towards the consultative committee of workers and managers, in form, though not in name, a &quot; Whitley &quot; Council. He also reported that the superintendent had been fair to the workers, had never deliberately misrepresented workmen to the managers, had been largely responsible for the success of the institution, and had throughout endeavoured to exercise a high sense of justice and great consideration for the men although, perhaps, he had not been very tactful. There would be serious difficulties in admitting a representative of the League to the Board of Managers, and the dismissal of the superintendent would be neither justifiable nor creditable.Canal Workers. A meeting of the employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s sub-committees took place at Montagu House on the 23rd September. Sir John Eaglesome, for the employers, submitted a draft proposal for a suggested Inland Waterways Joint Council. This was discussed and approved by the meeting; The draft will be submitted to a fully representative meeting of all employers concerned, at Birmingham, on the 1st October. If the draft is then approved, the employers will decide as to the number of representatives from each side. It was decided that the first meeting of the Council should take place at Montagu House as soon as possible after the 1st October.QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.Woollen Workers (West Wales).-The lock-out notices, affecting all the West Wales works took effect on the 18th September. The employers had previously been considering working three-quarter time, on account of the serious state of the trade and the possi-bility of a coal strike. The&apos;employers refuse to consider the case of the worker dismissed at Cwerchyr Mill until work is resumed. At the moment there appears little hope of a resumption, but a favourable issue of the coal dispute may have some effect.Vehicle Builders (National).* The National Union of Vehicle Builders tendered strike notices, which expired on the 25th September, to enforce a claim for an advance of 6d. per hour on the minimum rates set forth in the last Agreement, dated March, 1920. The employers refuse to concede any advance which is not based on increased output. On the 24th September a representative of the department saw separately representatives of the employers and of the union, but neither party was willing to agree to a conference to discuss the wages position generally.* See also p. 412 above.
Wages and Arbitration Department-continued.Lairage Workers (Birkenhead and Mancheser) In connection with the strike of slaughtermen at Manchester and the threatened strike at the Birkenhead and Wallasey lairages, an officer of the department saw a representative of the Ministry of Food and also representatives of the employers and of the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union. He suggested that a joint conference of the parties, under the chairmanship of an officer of the department, which would deal with the whole question of wages and working conditions, might prove a way out of the deadlock. This suggestion is being placed before the employers&apos; committee, but their representative is doubtful whether they will accept it, owing to the different nature of the work undertaken at Manchester and at Birkenhead.Basket Makers (London).-Members of the London Union of Journeymen Basket Makers are on strike for an increase of 15 per cent., wh ch was applied for last June. A joint meeting of the parties concerned was held on the 22nd September, the Chief Con-ciliation Officer, London, presiding. The employers complained of foreign competition, and maintained that no increases in wages would be justified. It was decided that each side should ascertain the views of their party as to referring the question to the Industrial Court, and a further joint meeting will be held on the 29th September.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration will be found also on pages 406 to 412 and 421 to 426.]
