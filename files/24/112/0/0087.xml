474I Joint Memorandum by the President of the Board of Ira&amp;e and tho Minister of labour.As requested by tho Cabinet (Cabinet 32 [20) Minutes l) we now present a Report, with appendices, setting forth the results of a departmental enquiry into the question whether the Index Number of ftetail  :rioes OOmpilod by the Ministry of Labour is appropriate .as an index to rariations in the cost ot living of the wording classes. The Report is based on a comparison of prices on 1st June, 1920^ with those prerailing in July, 1914.H.S. HORNS,October 16th, 1920.
IflDBX KUIiBER OF RETAIL PRICES.In aooordanoo with the instructions of tho Cabinet, representatives of tho Statistical Department of the Board of Trade and of tho Department of Intelligence and Statistics in the Ministry of Labour haVo jointly made an examination of the Indox Number of Retail pricos compiled in tho lattor Department with spocial reference to its appropriateness as an index to variations in tho cost of living of tho working &quot;classes..   The attached memorandum sets out some details of tho results of this examination, particular attention being given to the criticisms and suggestions containod in the Report of the Sumner Committoe.Tho process of calculating tho index number is in effect the following.   Tho results of an enquiry into tho actual pre-war expenditure of a number of working class families furnish a list of the principal articles of food consumed by those familios, and tho quantities of each article used per,week.    Taking tho30f quantities as a basis, the expenditure required to purchase equal quantities at any date can be calculated when tho prices for that date havo boon ascertained.     Tho comparison of the total ox-ponditure thus calculated for cliff oront dates show:, tho average variation   rom tine to time in tho pricos of those articles. In addition to a figure recording variations in tho cost of food compiled as just doscribed, the effect of changes in price on expendituro for fuel, clothing etc., and of changec,in rents i$ ostimated and combined with the food prices index in proportions oorrosponding with the average importance of those items in pro-war working class expenditure.   In effect, tho index numbor furnishes a comparison between the monoy cost at different times of a determinate schodule of commodities intended to represent tho averago pre-&quot;ar weekly purchases of a working olas3 family. This schedule of commodities may fail to bo representative either because of changes in habits or expenditure since the date of the/inquiry
inquiry on which it is based, or because tho particulars obtained woro not fully roprosontativo ovon for the dato of tho inquiry.    The examination of tho figures that has boon mado has boon especially aimed at testing the effect on tho reliability of the figures which would result from thoso two qualifications in the data.     Tho remaining data used, namely records of actual prlco3, thoro appears to bo   no reason for Examining spocially, particularly in view of the conclusion of the Sumnor Committee that tho procoduro for ascertaining prices might bo regarded as satisfactory,Tho most important linos of criticism of the index number havo boon that (a) it is based oh an incomplete budget of Expenditure, some items of wor]:being-class consumption not being ta&apos;:en into account,  (b) tho total expenditure shown in tho average pro-war budgot, o$%which the statistic   are based, wa3 inadequate for a working-class family and (c) tho changes in working class consumption since tho dato to which the budgot relates have mado its basis unsatisfactory.As regards tho first of those criticisms, it is true that some items of expenditure (including certain articles of food of minor importance, boor and spirits, trade union etc subscriptions, posta?o and furnishings) aro not takon into account.   The omissions are due in some cases (o,$. with fresli fruit and groon vegetables) to tho difficulty of making satisfactory comparisons betwoon prices for similar qualitios of articles at difforont dates, and in othor cases to tho relatively small importance of the article^ in working class family expenditure.   The commodities included, however, account for at least three fourths of tho pre-war working-class family expenditure, and tho exclusion of tho romaindor could not seriously affoct tho final index numbers unless the 1$ average psreontago increase in tho price of all those excludedarticlos, takon in combination, differed very greatly from tho percentage shown by tho indox number based on tho- S - &apos;
included articles,, From an examination which has been made of. the pre-war and presont prices of those excluded articles for which information is available it would appear that their in-conclusion might raise the index number very slightly, but probably not by more than two or three points.With regard to the second orlticiem, it is important to notice that, even though the average budget usod as tho basis pf the calculation were admitted to represent an expenditure inade-quate to provide satisfactorily for an average family, it would by no means follow that the validity of the index number was affected, at any rate in more than a negligible dogree. If, for example, it were necessary to add a large percentage to, or even to double, the amounts of and the expenditure on each of the commodities making up the budget, the index number would be entirely unaffected by such a change.   In so far as the substi-tution of an adequate for an inadequate basis of expenditure merely means a proportionate addition to each and every art$o.lo consumed, the question of whether the budget is adequate or in-adequate has no relation to the problem before us.   As a matter of fact, however, the raising of wages to a level adequate to fvrnirtftiatlrfaotory ataodart of living from a level inade-quate to that end, does not in^praotice mean equal proportionate increases in all commodities consumed, and it has been necessary to examine what effect is produced owing to disproportionately large, or disproportionately snail, increases in particular lines of expenditure.    It was Known in advance from the general theoretical examination that has boon made by many writers on the subject of index numbers, that, unless the relative import-ance of the different items out of w/which the composite index number.is compounded is very badly misrepresented in tho calou-lations, the effect of substituting data in which the relative importance is truly reflooted will be only trifling.   It has, in effect, been a commonplace with &apos;      index numbers statisticians that the figures which express the relative importance of the different items in a composite index number need only be aecer-tained with a rough degree of aocuracy.   This general
theoretical principle has been tested and verifi d in the particular instance before us&apos; , and lt is found that an Index number based on the budgets of the more highly paid group of wage earneri from whom information was obtained gives a measure of the change in price level, between 1914 and tho present time, almost identical with that represented by the published index number.     Thus what was to be expected from general theoretical considerations has been verified in practice.    While it might possess a certain decree of advantage to base tho taloulations upon a budget of expenditure recognised to be in no sorts e inadequate, were this done, the effect produced on the arithmetical results of the existing procedure would lie negligence-gibloi     There would, however, be involved an obvious disabled^ranta^ in that some suspicion o  bad faith might be developed wore the fundamental basis of index number calculations varied at the present time.The third of the points of criticisms to which reference has been made above is that present expenditure, rather than the expenditure of half a generation ago, should form the basis of calculations that are to be applied in guiding current wage changes.    In a large degree this criticism is met by the same considerations that have just been discussed.     If the changes of the last sixteen years had fundamentally altered the propor-tions of expenditure on food, clothing etc. and the proportion in which the more Important articles of food affect the total expenditure it might be of considerable moment to base the calculations on current expenditure rather than on past expenditure.    So far a3 the comparison of the results of the inquiry conducted under the auspices of the Sumner Committee with those of the earlier inquiry made by the Board of Trade goes, lt would appear that the 1914 figures of expenditure differed very little from the earlier figures, that is to say, that the relative importance of the different items in the Index number showed no indication of any large change.
During the war the supplies of oertain articles, such ao, meat, bacon, butter, chee.-.fe and sugar, wore so greatly reduoed that the proportions of the family income spent on different foods wer* necessarily   modified^ but, with the great improve^-ment in supplier which has since taken place, there has bten a reversion towards trie pre-war proportions.     Only in the case of sugar have supplies remained exceptionally small, tho domestic ration at first June being equivalent to about one-half the consumption indicated by tho budgets used in compiling the index number^    The aggregate quantity of sugar entered for home consumption for all purposes during the second quarter of the current year was, however, about 70 per cent, of the average quarterly consumption before the war, and, in the preceding twelve months, the amount so entered fell short by only one-eighth of the corresponding quantity for 1913, which was substantially greater, per head of the population than the consumption at the date to which the budgets relate.     If the basi3 of the index number calculations were so revised, as to assign to sugar only one-half of its pre-war weight, the effect on the final index number for all items of expenditure would be a reduction by about 8 points, i.e. the percentage increase of 150 shown for 1st June would be reduoed to 142*.   It should )*e observed, however, that all sweetened   commodities and sugar substitutes (e.g. jams, marmalade, confectionery, syrup, treacle, glucose, oakes and pastries, oondensed milk, saccharin and honey) are excluded from t,.e present index number.     The reduc-  -tion in the supplies of domestic sugar has, in many cases led to an increase in the proportion of expenditure allotted to this group of commodities, while the ratio of increase in their prices has, on the average, been greater than that expressed by the*The sugar ration has since been increased to flbt    If this quantity were used in computing the index number the difference of eight points would be reduced to 4 points.8.
general index number for ail the foods included within its scope.     The difference of 8 points* referred to above   would, therefore, be reduced if thio group of commodities were included, and as already indicated the inclusion of other items (e.g. rico, lard and currants) at present excluded from the calculations would.further reduce the difference.In the oourcc of the past seven years there has beon a considerable substitution of margarine for butter, tho propor-tion of butter to margarine consumed by the whole population having been at the beginning of the period about 11 to 5 and at the, end about 5 to 8.     Taking account of this redistribution of fconfrumption and assuming that, as i3 natural, the margarine substituted for the displaoed butter was of the better and dearei qualities, the reduction in expenditure compared with the cost of maintaining the old rates would bring down the Ministry of Labour General Index Number by two points or from 150 to 148. Some uncompensated loss in satisfaction arising from the substitution must, however, be taken into account.     It may be contended that, as the increase in the price of certain articles (e.g. potatoes and eggs) is considerably greater than the general average, whilst with certain other articles (e.g. margarine and tea) it is considerably less than that average, there has probably been a tendency, in many cases, to re-distribute expenditure so as to buy proportionately more of the lower priced articles, or of those articles which have trisen least in prlco, and less of those for which the rise is greatest, with a view to evading the full percentage increase shown by the index number.     While it is probable that adjustments&apos; of the kind have been made in many cases in which wages have risen leoa than prices, it is necessary to remember that a large proportion of the working classes have claimed that their pre-war wages were inadequate for the maintenance of   efficiency, and in numerous cases (exemplified in the recent wage settlement with the railwaymen) they have succeeded in obtaining increases in
wages considerably greater than the increase in prices indicated by the Ministry of Labour index number.     In such cases thegeneral tendency will have been in the direction of Improving onthe pre-war standard of living, and it is therefore unsafe toassume that, on trie average,   working class consumption has been diverted In the direction of a depreciated standard.    Further,even if such an assumption were justifiable, it is evident thatsome loss of satisfaction would be involved in the substitution of a depreciated standard of living for that prevailing beforethe war, and this loss of satisfaction vould not be reflected inan index number compiled on the basis of the depreciated standard.AS supplies continue to improve, the tendency will be to approaohstill closer to the pro-war standard, and an alternative calcula*tion based, for example, on the restricted quantity of sugar now available would require revision as supplies were increased.   Theappearance of instability whioh wotild be created by ohanges of thikind In the basis of the index number would destroy the present general confidence in its substantial accuracy.It is tnerefore very doubtful whether any advantage, otherthen a purely formal advantage, would be obtained by substitutingcurrent expenditure for past expenditure as a basis of calculation of the index number.    Such a substitution would of course involvethe disadvantage already stated, namely, the risk of an appearance of twisting the index number to meet administrative policy.   Apartfrom this last consideration It would probably be desirable when stablemore/jjonditions are reached to make a new Inquiry into working olass expenditure and to calculate the index number for a series of years on the basis derived from such n*w inquiries, and having thus obtained the means of coinparlng the new index number with the old, to make the calculations thence forward for another term of years on the result of the latest inquiry.     To initiate such a procedure, however, \JHfaen the application of the Index number to
wages regulation is so deli ante a matter as at present, appears Inexpedient, partioularly as no sufficient reason exists for believing that an index number based upon a new set of budgets would differ materially from that now oompiled by the Ministry of Labour,Finally, it may be noted that the British Smpire Statistical-Conference consisting of Government offloors dealing with statistics in the British Smpire assembled in London in the early part of this year and gave careful considernation to the problems oormected with the measurement of priee-ohanges oy mears of index numbers.    As the result of their deliberations the Conference resolved unanimously that such index numbers should be so oonstructed as to express &quot;the proportion of the aggregate, expenditure on the seleoted list of representative commodities, in the quantities selected as appropriate at the one date, to the aggregate expenditure on the same list of commodities, in the same quantities, at the other date&quot;.   The principle laid down in this resolution is that followed in the construction of the Ministry of Labour index numbers.As regards the adjustment of the index numbers to provide for ohanges in the character of national consumption, the Con-ferenoe were of opinion that &quot;it is desirable to revise from time to time, say at decennial intervals, the list of oommoditieSv and appropriate quantities on whioh index numbers are fcased&quot;. They also reoommended, however, that when such revision took plaoe the index numbers should be ealculated for at least four years on both lists.    The Sumner Committee&apos;s index numbers, on the other hand, compared the cost of a group of commodities at one date with the cost, at another date, of a differently oonstituted group, In which allowanae had been made for ohanges in consumption between the two dates.
cost of giving.A. Fofci.I, Tlie Ministry of Labour Index Number of Food Prices.&quot;The statistics prepared by the Ministry of Labour are designed to measure the average increase in the coat of maintaining the pre-war sTandard of living of the working classes.     By this is bant the average standard actually prevailing in working*class families just before the war. irrespective of whether or not such standard was adequate&quot; (Labour Gazette, March, 1920, p.118).Information is obtained In all towns with a population exceeding 5O,00C at the Census of 1911, and in a representa-tive selection of 540 smaller towns and villages distributed . throughout the United Kingdom.    Altojgether 630 towns and villages are reported on.    &quot;Separate returns are obtained for different districts in the Metropolitan Area, and by this means London is Given its appropriate weight in the statistics&quot;, (10c.cit.).    Returns are obtained from about 5,500 retailers, many of whom have several shops at which identical prices are maintained.    The Sumner Committee regarded this investigation as &quot;accurate and adequate for its purpose&quot; (Appendix, par. 31.)For oach article the returns are tabulated separately for large towns and smaller places, and separate unweighted arithmetic averages are calculated so as to give the per-centage increase since July, 1914.    The average for the United Kingdom is taken as the mean between the averages for tho large towns and for the smaller places.    Reference to the Census figures show that this is approximately correct-^The next point in the calculation is the weighting of the ascertained prices.    This is done on the baais of the average expenditure shown by 1944 working-class budgets collected by the Board of Trade in 1904.    &quot;The adoption of heights&apos; basod on the expenditure of 1904 was not In-validated by changes in quantities between 1904 and 1914, because tho changes in quantity (which were&apos; generally slight) were largely counterbalanced by changes in price-level, with tho result that the proportions of Income spent on the different commodities could not have been sensibly altered except as regards margarine, for which a special allowance was made&quot;, (loccit).The Sumner Committee said (Appendix I, par.7): &quot;The result of all the changes of quantities estimated from 1904 to 1914 is so slight that practically the same total expenditure is found whether we apply 1914 prices to the 1904 quantities as first given or to the 1914 quantities as now estimated.&quot;    And in paragraph 9: &quot;The expenditure shown in the table is, if anything, a^ underestimate a few more pence were perhaps spent on meat, and more possibly on those semi-luxuries, which, for want of in-formation, are assumed to have remained at the same level, while the butter anc1 margarine total may be 3d, out in either direction; but we can hardly add more than 1/-(or 4 per cent) to the total on any justifiable hypothesis, nor subtract more than 3d.&quot;
The Sumner Committee considered (Report, paragraph 34) that the unskilled class was probably under-represented in the 1904 budgets, and that, therefore, the Increase in expenditure between 1914 and 1918, as measured by the difference between the 1904 budgets adjusted to 1914 and the 1918 budgets, was under-estimated by about 4/1.    This under-representation of the unskilled class in the 19)4 budgets, however, is not sufficiently serious to have any material effect on the Ministry of Labour index-number of prices.    Another important point is that the 1904 budgets register the actual expenditure of the period without regard to the adequacy of that expenditure.     They have, consequently, been criticised, from the labour point of view a3 basing the calculation of wa^es on too lor: a standard.There is more serious difficulty in regarding the budgets collected as being fairly representative of working-class expenditure, on account of the smallness of their number relative to the- number of wor::ing-class families.    They were, however, carefully filled up and tbeve is no   reason for supposing that they err in over-estimating rather than in under-estimating expenditure.The foodstuffs included in the Ministry of Labour statistics cover over three-fourths of the total family expenditure on food in normal times; the chief omissions are fruit and vegetables other than potatoes.    There is no reason for supposing that the rises in the prices of the omitted foodstuffs were les3 than, rather than greater than, the rises in the prices of the included foodstuffs, and, consequently, it is as likely that the index-number understates the rise as that it exaggerates it.It must be repeated that the i:adex*hu;;iber of retail food prices is put forward by the Ministry of Labour only as a means of measuring the movement in the prices of a specific group of commodities, assuming consumption of uni-form quantities over the period under consideratibn.    The Sumner Committee reports (Appendix 1, paragraph 31) &quot;The method used is appropriate to measure the change In prices, but not the change of expenditure or the cost of living. In normal times, when consumption changes slowly and habits are not altered, these three quantities move in close re-lationship, and the index-numbers of retail prices can be applied with little adjustment to measure the change in the cost of living: but In times of movement, even much less catastrophic than those of the war years, general index-numbers are limited in their application5&apos;.II. The Sumner Committee Budget.Having made the adjustments of the 1904 budgets to 1914 -orices already referred to, the Sumner Committee con-eluded that they had established the level of working- class expenditure in June, 3.914, &quot;without material error1&apos;.    In order to ascertain the expenditure in June, 1918, they Isaaed lj,0-)0 budget forms and obtained 1,4./J returns,    They also calculated on the basis of estimates of relative food require -ments of men, women and children, that the standard family in the 1904-14 budgets was equivalent to 4,57 men whereas for  , 1918 it was 4,57 men.    Taking the latter figure the average expenditure on food in 1914 was 24/11 per family aad in 1918 it was 47/o, while the total household expenditure on food, fuel, clothing, rent, ..&quot;-.c., in 1914 was 44/4 and 75/5d. in 1918.    The increase in the expenditure on food
was 90$ between 1914 and 1918, but the rise in the prices of foods, assuming uniform consumption, was 110$ according to the Ministry of Labour index number of retail prices. The rise in the household e expenditure was f0%9 but, owing to the under-representation of the unskilled classes in the budgetst the Committee thought it should be 74$ (paragraph 34).    For the same reason (although the Committee do not take this point) the rise in tho cost of food should apparently be about 97 .por cent or 13 points Velow the rise in the price of food.    If the food budget for 1914 is too low by a shilling the increase in expenditure is 82% instead . of 90$.*11. The budget of 1918 shows considerable changes indietary compared vdth that of 1914, but the calorie value is stated by the Committee to be only 3/&amp; less for skilled families and to havo actually risen for unskilled families (para 38).     Many foods purchasable freely in 1914 could not be obtained in sufficient quantity in 1918, and in many the quality had deterJjaftcbed; the latter fact might lead to an important inos^ase in the reduction of calorie value beyond what the Committee estimate.12. -        Professor Bo-vley, who was a member oi&apos; the Su-nner Committee has interpreted the results as follows (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, May 1919):- hA person, who in 1914 had bought the dietary which was reached according to the urban budgets in 1918, would have paid 18/9;;d for it (excluding the foods for which prices cannot be stated); or more briefly the value of the 1918 dietary at pre-war prices was 13/9Jd. A similar person buying the average 1914 dietary expended 20/6-1. 1918 dietary was worth 8&quot;i per cent, less at pre-war valuation than the 1914 dietary.    The loss of satisfaction may perhaps be considered approximately the same as if the head of a family in 1914 had had to cut down his expenditure on food from 24/lld. to 22/lOd. (including here an estimate for the unpriced foods.)     If tho choice had been free, he would have cut down his purchases of the food that pleased or nourished him1 least and lost less than 8l per cent, of his satisfaction; as it is, the enforced modifications were, quite possibly of a kind which cut off more than 8-J per cent...... To put the result more crudely, the urban workman spent90$ more on food and got 8i per cent, less in return.    In this measurement it is assumed that there is no change in quality - and, theoretically, that should be allov^ed for in estimating the prices - but actually I doubt if the bacon of the summer of 1918 would have been valued at 11Jd. a lb. in 1914&quot; (p.351).... .&quot;Y/e can now amplify our earlier statement as follows:   the urban workman spent 90 per cent, more on food in 1918 than in 1914, and in return got 8-1 per cent less in satisfaction or 3 per cent, loss in nutrition.     If he had increased all his purchases in 1918 in proportion so as to restore the nutrition, the statement would have become, he spent 96 per cent, more on food, obtained the same nutri-tion, but 5i per cent, less satisfaction, a loss valued in 1914 at ls.5d. per family per week&apos;&apos;, (pp.353-4)13.        Apart from the facts that the increase in the cost of food should be about 97% instead of 90 : and that the estimate of the loss in calorie value is certainly too low, the Summer Budget cannot serve as a starting point for wage calculations. The circumstances under which it was computed were too abnormal and at best it serves only as a record of the manner in which expenditure was distributed at a particular level of income. In the debate on Professor Bowley&apos;s paper Sir L. Chiozza Money pointed out that if a miner could not get his usual cheose for
hi a lunch his expenditure would show a reduction and that that might even he used as an argument foaj reducing; or for refusing to raise hie wages.III. Ministry of Pood Expenditure Estimates.14. The Mi .i?try of Food from the Autumn of 1917 attempted to measure changes in family expenditure on food on the basis of their records of total consumption in the United Kingdom.    The results applied to the population as a whole, no estimates being made for working-class families separate-ly.    This procedure was open to various ariticisms, especially that the effects of prices and rationing on working-class families were assumed to be the same as for the population as a whole, which was almost certainly not the case.    Secondly, estimates could only be made for meat, bacon, fish, flour, bread,   tea, sugar, milk, cheese, butter and margarine, and there was &amp;reat uncertainty as to the consumption of fish, milk, cheese, potatoes and sugar.    Nevertheless, these estimates, so far as they went confirmed the accuracy of the 1918 budgets,15, The Ministry of Labour have published monthly in theLabour Gazette, along with  their own index of food prices, the Ministry of Food!s estimate of expenditure expressed as a percentage of the expenditure of July, 1914.    The two indexes are set out below, side by side for comparison, and it is to be home in mind that while the Ministry of Labour index expresses the movements of the expenditure necessary to provide uniform quantities of a certain group of food-stuffs, the Ministry of Pood index number expresses the changes in the expenditure by the population as a whole on the articles of food mentioned in the preceding paragraph, allowing for estimated changes in consumptionMinistry of Labour Ministry of Food July, 1914 * 100,   July, 1914 a 100,1919 January........... 230 179February.......... 230 177March.......,..... 220 179April............. 213 187May............... 207 181June............... 204 187July.,............ 209 197August............. 217 208September......... 216 203October........... 222 213November.......... 231 219December.......... 254 2161920 January .......... 236 215February.235 212March............. 233 207April............. 235The figures relate to the beginning of the month in each case.    After Marc::, 1920, ti.e Ministry of Food ceased to furnish the information required for the calculation of their index-number, since the statietios of consumption collected by them were no longer, in their opinion, sufficiently com-plete to form        a satisfactory basis for estimates as to quantities purchased.

Considering the funda-mental defects of the Ministry of Food*s record no closer approximation could be oxpeoted than was reached in August, 1919, and it is safe to say that if tho Ministry of labour indox number were - mistakenly - used as an index of oxpendituro oh food, the orror involved would, during the latter half of 1919, be well within 10 per cent.   After October, 1919j tho defects of the kinistry of Foodrs indox number seem to have increased for some time beforo thoy thought it wise to discontinue it. It is not credible that, during six months of rising prices and rising wages, expenditure on food should have aotually diminished, and the Ministry of Food*s index numbers for that period cannot be used as a means of criticising the Ministry of Labour figures.B. IT3MS OTHER THAU FOOD.I. SHE) MINI STAY OF LABOUR IMD5X NUMBER OF PRI0E1S.17.       In addition to prices of food, tho Ministry of Labour indox number includes rents anC the prices of clothing, fuel and light and other items.   As regards rents, during the period discussed the Rent Restriction Acts provide that, for the same aocommoda-tion, rents of working-olass dwellings may not be raised by more tftan the equivalent of the increase in rates.   Information as to tjaese inoreases in rates and their effect on rents has been olbtained from time to time by correspondence with the town clerks . of 100 of the principal towns.   The infonnation relatos to \ unfurnished dwelling-houses of the typo usually occupied by working-olass familiesj and account is taken of the Increased rents due to increasod rates. Information as to movements in the prioos of clothing (including men1s suits and overooats, woollen and cotton materials for womonrs outer garments, woollen and ootton underolothing and hosiery and boots), coal, gas, oil, candles, matches, soap, soda, domestic ironmongery, brushes, and p^tery is collected monthly from a large number of shop-keepers in the principal towns, either directly through the post or by local correspondents of the Ministry.   While it is difficult in somo oases, especially in that of clothing, to ensure that the statistics for ttyo present cjato relate to qualities idencioal with, or&apos; equal to, those purchased in 1914, care is takon to preserve the greatest possible degree of comparability, tho shop-keeper being supplied on each occasion when an enquiry is made with the prioos he returned at the previous enquiry and asked to quoto the corresponding prioe at the ourrent date.   As regards tobacco and oigarottes, fares and newspapers, no regular enquiry is neoessary, particulars being available through the medium of public announcements; when neoessary these aro supplemented by special inquiries.

Assuming the pre-war working class family income ti average about  2. a week, it would appear, on the basis of the information available, that about 24s. was spent on food, about 6s. on rent, As * 6d. to 5s. on olothing and 2s.9d. to 3s. on fdel and light, the remainder being applied to miscellaneous expenditure, insurance etc.     There is no reason to think that the statistics exaggerate the rise in the prices of those commodities taken as a whole.     As regards certain items which are not included in the statistics (e.g., beer and spirits, furniture, and holidays), it may be observed that they form in the aggregate only a very small proportion of total working-olass wuekly expenditure.    horeover, some have Increased in price more and others less than the average and it is very unlikely that the general average increase would be appreciably affected by the inclusion of a larger number of items even if it were found practicable to extend the list.II.   THS SUMNT3R COIiKITTEE BUDGET.19. The method adopted by the Sumner Gommittee was to estimate the average expenditure of working-class families in 1914. This estimate was compared with the average expenditure in 1918, as ascertained by a special enquiry into working-class budgets which the Gommittee made in that year, and the differ-enoe between the two sets of figures, was regarded as indicating the rise in cost of living between 1914 and 1918.For all items other than food, the information on which estimates of working-olass expenditure (as distinct from priue movements) are founded is weak, especially for the time before the war.     Thus for fuel pre-war information is limited to 110 budgets, and the Sumner Committee adopted the assumption that clothing was reponsible for one-seventh of the weekly working-class expenditure on the principal other neoessarles.     Informa tlon as to rents is on a somewhat sounder basis.     Current % comparisons of average expenditure on fuel and clothing with pre-war times are, therefore, lacking in substantiality when any attempt is made to pass beyond personal experience and vague recollection.     The estimates did not differ widely from those made by the kinistry for Labour, e.g., the general3 21
average of expenditure on rent was taken at 6/7 per week and that on clotiiing at 5/6.   Wor&amp;ing-olass expenditure is so dominated by food., that an index number of expenditure including; the movements of rents, fuel, clothing, &amp;o*, is certain to differ but little from one recording the movements of expenditure on food only.   The more inolusive figure gives an appearacce of reality which vanishes when the slender evidence for the groups other than food is considered.   At the present moment observation suggests that the working-olasses, especially the lower strata, are better clothed than they were before the war, and it is not improbable thet clothing constitutes a larger proportion of their expenditure than formerly.0. Comparison of Measures of Cost of Living,20. It is admitted even by Professor Bowley, whose animus against&quot;official&quot; statistics Is marked, that the Ministry of Labour Index number, - which, registers the relatlvo cost of maintaining the pre-war standard of living, is &quot;sufficiently accurate for periods in whioh changes have been gradual and uncorrelated&quot; (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, May, 1919, p.347). Seeing, however, th*t during the war the limitation of supplies made it impossible to maintain the standard without modification, Professor Bowley holds that the index number has become invalid and &quot;of no practical importance11.   &quot;Enormous and very expensive mischief&quot;, he says, &quot;has been caused by this publication; the figure is oommonly quoted by the Press as measuring the increase in the cost of living (not in the rise in prices, in spite of the italics in the Labour Gasette), and it is quite naturally used by Labour Leaders as measuring the increase of wages neoessary to meet the rise of prices.   It appears not to be- challenged by the Government, whon adjudicating on wages, and actually formed part of the basis by which railway wages were to be fixed in September, 1918........ but the evidence of the (Sumner)Committee showed quite clearly that while the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index numbers showed a rise of 110 per cent, in food prices from July, 1914, to Juno, 1918, actual expenditure had only increased 90 per cent, while the fall in standard of living was very small, and necessitated by war conditions. Every 4 points oost over a million pounds in the annual railway wage bill&quot;, (op.oit. p.348).21. Passing over what has already been said as to the in-sufficient measure of the decline in calorie value shown by the Sumner Budget, it should be noted that the shortage In war-time supplies is diminishing and is now ohiefly conspicuous in sugar and butter.   Censequently, the criticism against the use of the prices index-number as a measure of the oost of living is pro tanto ineffective, and will become increasingly ineffective.22..       More important is it to observe tbat expenditure depends upon wages and not wages upon expenditure.   The budge;ts of 1904 and 1918 are merely samples showing how expenditure la distributed at given levels of income.   They de not by themselves constitute grounds for an increase in wages, for tbny are themselves determined by the wages earned.   To serva as a reasonMJ!%(?isMa?lWa^imf^^^SaM of th.past or to an ideal of the future.   Labour leaders have legiti-mately used tho Ministry of Labour index-number of retail prices as measuring the expenditure necessary to secure the same amount ef &quot;satisfaction&quot; (to use Professor Bowley!b term) as before the war, and, seeing that the pre-war standard was not necessarily an adequate standard but almost certainly an inadequate one,
shey might justifiably have regarded the excess of the index-number over the Sumner measure rs indicating tho minimum of the claim they were entitled to make at that time.   The general Labour aim is to obtain a greater shpro of the product of labour, a greater share of the national income, and this will always be justified by referenoe to an ideal of the future r*-thc r than to a standard of the pest.   Refercnoe to a standard of the past-and the Ministry of Labour index-number may be taken as an im-perfeot measure of the cost of maintaining a standard of satis-faction set up at a past drte - will be medc ohiefly for two reasons.   Ono is to ensure that there is no slipping back, in real wages; the other is chrt those ale sets whose wages have risen less than the everago which she index-number of prices expresses may use it as an argument for bringing their remuncra-tion up to the average1), EX&amp;MIH/.MON OF AN &quot;ADEQUATE&quot; BUDGET.23.        Some criticism has been loveiled ^gainst the Ministry of Labour index-number on the ground that a large propertiom of the budgets from which the weights rre oaloulf tod wero not adequate for reasonable maintenance.   It will, therefore, be useful to examine ti^e result of taking as a basis a series of budgets more adequate than the average budget, and for this purpose the ex-$expenditure of families with a family income of 40s. a week and over (averaging 52s.) in 1904 has been taken..  As the families In question averaged 6.4 persons (including 4.4 children) the standard of expenditure may be assumed to bo fairly adequate, but not more than adequate.24.        Food.- Particulars are given on page 25 of tho second Series of Memoranda on British and Foreign  rede and Industry (Cd.2337) published in 1904.   Some adjustment has been made as regards margarine, and bread has been&quot;sep&amp;.rated from flour.25.        Some trouble arises with regard to &quot;meat&quot;.   The budget under oensideration gave for &quot;wept bought by weight&quot; an average eon-sumption of 8.19 lbs. oosting 5s.l0 d, (in 1904), the average price thus being 8.61d. per lb.   Under &quot;moat bought by weight&quot; were included beef, mutton, veal, pork and sausages, but no separation of those five items was m?dc.   On the whole, however, it would appear that no serious error would be involved by the assumption that the average price of ell the &quot;meat bought by weight&quot; was close to the everase price of beef and mutton, it would appear from this average&quot;that families of the skilled class of workers did not consume much imported meat before the war or, if thty did, it was mainly of the better grades and outs.   The relative importance of imported refrigerated beef and mutton in the, nations food supply had, however, increased considerably in tho years between 1904 and 1914, and the prices of the better outs of imported meat had appropohed more closely those of tho like outs of home-killed meat.   During the war this approximation of prices proceeded furtkr, and it appears to be sufficient for the purpose in hind to assune for the &quot;adequate&quot; budget, as is done for the general Index Number, that imported and homo-killed meat are of equal importance.   The mean of the prices quoted in the Labour Gazette for the better outs of meat in July, 1914, taking into aooount both British and imported meat and giving beof twice the weight of mutton, was       per lb. whioh corresponds olosely with the figure qVoted above.   For June, 1920, the corresponding average, according to the Labour Gazette, was ls.6j-d, and these figures h&amp;ve accordingly been used in the calculations which follow.
The consumption of margarine inoreased considerably between 1904 and 1914,   The Stunner Committee oaloulated that in 1914 it formed one-fifth cf the consumption of butter and margarine together, but this is plainly erroneous.   In 1913 the home-production of margarine vans between 80,000 and 85,000 tons and the net import? amounted to about 75,000 tons;   the net import of butter was about 200,000 tons and even if the 19C7 production cf butter (about 100,000 tons) was maintained, which is very doubtful, tho proportion of margarine must have been half that of butter.   Butter and jnargarins are, according-ly, weighted as 2 to lv,   These quantity weights fcgree closely with the quantities represented by the expenditure weights adopted by the Ministry of Labour.We can now work out the movement of expenditure between July, 1914, and 1st June, 1920, on the basis of a bu&amp;got of a higher standard than that used for the Ministry of Labour index-number.1.

Adding the cost of these foodstuffs to that of those included in the Ministry of LabourfB index number, it is found that to obtain the came food which in July, 1914, cost 29/10 would require in June, 1920, the expenditure of 77/4 - an increase of 159 per cent.
28. Fuel and Light.   The Sumner Committee estimated the totalfamily expenditure on oosl and gas only in 1914 at 2/4 per week. The Ministry of Labour also include oil, candles, and matches and estimate the total ^re-war expenditure on fuel and light at 2/9 to 3/- a week.   For the cl&amp;ss of families now under consideration, the higher figure may be taken.   Following the Ministry&apos;c classification and teeing the higher figure, the expenditure in June, 1920, allowing for 125 per oont, increase In prices, would be 6/9 a week.29. Rent.   The rent paid by families of the skilled class was put by the Sumner Oommittee at 7/3 per week.   The Ministry of Labour estimate the increase sinoe July, 1914, at 15 to 20 per cent., making present rents 8/6 weekly.30. Clothing.   The Sumner Committee put the expenditure onclothing in July, 1914, at 7/- per week for a family of the skilled class, consisting of 5.6 worsens;&apos;  for a family of 6.4 persons it may be estimated at 8/*- weekly.   The Ministry of Labour statistics show an average increase of nearly 330 per cent, sinoe July, 1914, in the price of clothing of tho kinds bought by the working classes;   but the percentages for diiforent grades of articles show consideiablo variations and in general the percentage inorease (as distinct from the absolute increase) is highest in tho csso of those articles which were cheapest be-fore the war.   For the clothing which would be bought by tho skilled families now under consideration, therefore, the per-centage of increase would be lower and it is probably safe to assume that, for such families as a whole, the average percentage increase in the prices of clothing, taking the same quantities, and so far as possible the same qualities as in 1914, does noj; reaoh 300 per aent.   It will probably be sufficient to assume that a wsokly expenditure of about 30/- at the yricea of June,192C would give for this class of family, the same quantity and quaJXty of clothing as 0/- at the prices of July, 1914.31. Other items.   Insurance was estimated by the Sumner committee at 3/6 per week at tho earlier date, and in their view it had not substantially changed by 1918.   Insurance, however, is savings, and its value is determined,by the general cost of living;   this item is better   omitted from &quot;expenditure&quot;, workmen1s rail and tram fares, which were reckoned at l/- per week in July, 1914, may now be put at l/3.   For cleaning- materials the Sumner Committee estimated the pre-war expenditure at 6d. to 10d., averaging it at 8d.   Of this it may reasonably&quot;be taken that 6d. related to the prices of soap and soda, whioh^are in-oluded in the Ministry of Labour&apos;s statistics of prices..   The Sumner Report does not deal with expenditure on ironmongery, brushes, pottery, newspapers, and tobaoco, which are included in the Ministry of labour&apos;s statistics.   Expenditure on these items is in the table below left to bo included in the surplus remain-ing from the family income.   This surplus would of course vary widely in different oases according to the variations 14 tt e amount of wages actually earned by different individual s\wi^n the group under consideration. \

At the beginning of June,^ 1920) rates of wages were probably on the average abodt 140;&apos; higher than in July, 1914, but the per-oentage was less, on the average, for skilled men than for labourers.    In the building, engineering and shipbuilding industries, for example, the average for skilled men was about 130 per cent, and, applying this proportion, a family income of 57/-* a week in July, 191-:, would have risen to about 131/- by the beginning of June, 1920.    It may be noted that though the margin for expenditure on household necessaries and luxuries and for saving fell from 7/5 a week in 1914 to 5/9 a week in 1920, nearly all such objects on which money was spent had at least doubled in price.
mwmtx no.a.hWm AND MABGAHNB.I1,        Par the purposes of the Ministry of Labour index-number the a^naxage workijagwOaas consumption of butter per family is taken at If lbs, per week in 1914 and that of margarine at 1 lb,    Aooord-ing to information obtained from the Ministry of Pood and from the Trade Accounts the total consumption of butter in 1913 (which year is taken as more normal than 1914) was 327,000 tons, and that of margarine 149,000 tons, the proportion being about 21* of butter to 100 of margarine.    As ike worse-paid sections of the working classes would naturally consume more margarine and the well-to-do classes would consume more butter, the figures for ifte population as a whole do not contradict the Ministry of labour&apos;s figures,8.        Expenditure on butter and margarine in July 1914, and on 1st June, 1920, were as follows, on the assumption that the same quantities ware purchased on the latter date as on the formerprioe per lb,        Expenditure.lbs.

A total output of 120,000 tons for the United Kingdom in 1920 is not likely to be exceeded.    Net imports of butter during the first six months of 1920 amounted to 52,500 tons and as in 1913 the imports of the first half and of the second half of the year were praotioally&apos;\   identical in amount, we may calculate on 105,000 tons for the tfiole year.    $he total amount of butter available for consumption this year should thus be about 225,000 tons.
4965.        If the home production of margarine be maintained at the 1919 levftl (which was over one-third above that of 1918), and no reasonis known why it should not be maintained, and net imports for the second half of the year continue on the same scale as those for the first half (18,000 tons), the total quantity of margarine available should be about 355,000 tons,6, The total supply of butter will, therefore, be to the total supplyof margarine almost in the proportion of 5 to 8,    Consequently if the average working-olass family were to distribute in titis proportion * the purchases of the 2f lbs, of butter and margarine together which were made in 1914. the butter would be reduced to 1.06 lbs, and the margarine raised to 1,69 lbs.    If the whole of this 1,69 lbs, of margarine were of the low grades represented by the price of l/2d, a lb, (at June, 1930,) taken by the Ministry of Labour in relation to the pre-war prioe of 7^d. for 1 lb,, the weekly expenditure on butter and margarine in June, 1920, would thus bo 61,03 pence or 90 per oeht. above the actual expenditure in July 1914,    It would be unreasonable, however, to make such an assumption; for of tho increased quantity of 1,69 lb. of margarine, 0.69 lb, would have been direotly substituted for an equal quantity of butter, and it is probable, in these oiroum-stances, that this extra quantity would not be the low grade margarine represented by the prioe of l/2d. a lb, quoted above, but would usually be the better class &quot;oleo&quot; margarine, which is generally bought in substitution for butter.    The price of this margarine would average about l/9d, a lb, and on the basis of 1 lb. at l/2d. and 0.69 lb. at l/9d. with 1.06 lbs. butter at 2/llJd. the expendi-ture on butter and margarine would be 65,86 pence or 105 per cent, above the expenditure in July 1914.    If we take the budget set forth in paragraph 27 of the Appendix to the Report already put in on the index number of Retail Prices, and for the. 1,93 lbs. of butter and .97 lbs. of margarine purchased in July 1914, substitute for June 1920, 1,115 lbs. butter and 1,785 lbs. margarine, (the proportions of total supply in 1920), taking 0.97 lb, margarine at l/2d, and 0,815 lb, at l/9d, per lb, the expenditure thereon would be 70,00 pence.    This would reduce the increase per cent, on the articles of food included in the Ministry of Labour Index-Number from 155 to 151 per cent, and the general Index flumber for all items of expenditure from 150 to 148 per cent,7.        With the improvement in the manufacture of margarine and with the increase in the su-roly of butter and margarine from 476,000 &apos; tons in 1913 to 580,000* tons in 1920 it cannot be said that 1here is such a serious loss in &quot;satisfaction&quot; in the compulsory sub-stitution of high glass &quot;oleo&quot; margarine for butter as exists in the oase of many other substituted foods.    An uncompensated loss, is however, widely felt and must be taken into aocount.
