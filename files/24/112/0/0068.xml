QoCABINET.INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CONFERENCE.&apos; Held at Brussels in September-October 1920.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE herewith the papers containing the Reports of the Committees on Public Finance, Currency and Exchange, International Trade and International Credits, appointed by the Brussels International Financial Conference, and the Resolutions adopted by that Conference, together with a covering letter dated the 8th October, 1920, which I have received from Lord Chalmers on the subject.(Initialled)       A. C.Treasury Chambers,October 14, 1920.Copy of letter from Lord Chalmers to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.British Delegation, Palaee Hotel, My dear Chancellor, Brussels, October 8, 1920,THE International Financial Conference has now completed its labours, and I hasten to acquaint you with the results of the deliberations of a very distinguished (gathering of delegates from all parts of the world.After some days of general discussion the Conference set up four Committees (each under the Chairmanship of a Vice-President) to deal respectively with Public Finance, Currency and Exchange, International Trade and International Credits. I enclose copies of reports of these four Committees in the form in which they were yesterday adopted unanimously by the Conference.It was originally arranged that Mr. Brand should preside over the Committee on Public Finance, but I am extremely sorry to have to report that since Wednesday of last week he has been confined to his bed. As a result of his regretted indisposition, I was invited to preside over the Committee on Public Finance, and yesterday presented the report of that Committee to the Conference. The report, as jyou will observe, enunciates in short resolutions the basic principles of sound finance, and its merit lies not in any novelty of the remedies it suggests for the grave situation which confronts us, but in the unanimity with which the Conference was able to lend the weight of its experience and authority to the expression of those basic principles.Attention may particularly be called to the fourth Resolution, which presses the League of Nations to take energetic action to secure a general and agreed reduction of armaments; and&apos; the sixth Resolution which, while laying down the principle that each, country must pay its way, affirms that it was for each country to decide the precise methods of taxation best suited to its own internal economy.The Report on Currency and Exchange is equally to be commended as a record of an international expression of adherence to sound prescriptions when so many tempting and illusory remedies are put forward. No cleavage in the Committee perhaps, was more marked than that between the &quot;Dear Money &quot; delegates and the &quot;Cheap Money &quot; delegates. The references to this question in the report are, therefore, the result of the compromise; but even so, as the result of much effort[4569] B
; , REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CONFERENCE.IN accordance with arrangements made by the Council of the League of Nations, the International Financial Conference met at Brussels on Friday, the 24th September, 1920, in the Chamber of Deputies, which was generously placed at its disposal by the Belgian Government and the President of the Chamber.The discussions of the Conference, which sat until the 8th October, have been governed by the Resolution passed by the Council of the League in February 1920&quot; The League of Nations shall convene an International Conference with a view to studying the financial crisis and looking for the means of remedying and of mitigating the dangerous consequences arising from it,&quot;and by the further instruction approved by the Council on the 5th August, 1920, to the effect that &quot; none of the questions which are the subject of the present negotiations between the Allies and Germany should be discussed at the Conference.&quot;The Members of the Conference, eightly-six in number, while appointed by their several Governments, attended as experts and not as spokesmen of official policy. They were drawn from those with both private and official experience, and the condi-tions of their appointment permitted them to give the Conference the full benefit of their knowledge and to express their personal opinions with freedom. The Members so attending represented the following thirty-nine countries: Argentine. France. Norway.Armenia. Germany. Peru.Australia. Greece. Poland. ,. .Austria. Guatemala. Portugal.Belgium. Holland. Roumania.Brazil. Hungary. Serb-Croat-Slovene State. .,V Bulgaria. India. South Africa.Canada. Italy. Spain. 5 oChina, Japan. Sweden. .. :;Czecho-Slovakia. Latvia. Switzerland.. Denmark. Lithuania. United Kingdom.Esthonia. Luxemburg., United States of America,,Finland. New Zealand. Uruguay. ;&quot;A list of the Delegates and of their advisers is appended to this Report;I. Review of the Situation. .. Some of the financial ills from which, the world is suffering are common to all nations. But the severity of the malady and the effects which it has produced on the body politic have varied immensely in proportion to the degree in which each-nation has been immersed in the maelstrom of the war. In order, therefore, to get a complete, and balanced picture of the situation, the Conference first devoted itself to hearing an exposition of the financial situation of each of the thirty-nine countries, represented.   These statements constitute Volume III of this report.*      ,  .Certain of the belligerent countries of Europe (Belgium, Bulgaria, France,. Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal), unable to cover the expenses of the war from their national current revenue, find their balance sheet burdened with an enormous volume of both internal and external debt, the amount of the latter being still undetermined in the case of Germany. The total external debt of the European belligerents converted into dollars at par amounts to about 155 milliard dollars, compared with about 17 milliard dollars in 1913, which, even when full allowance is made for the depreciation of money, represents a tremendous burden in proportion to the total national income of the belligerent countries. The external debt, amounting to about 11 milliard dollars due to the United States, to If milliard pounds sterling due to Great Britain, presents an even more difficult financial problem, because in nearly every case it is payable in a currency which is less depreciated than that of the country concerned...- * Not reproduced. - ,   &quot; - .       -y). &apos;  1 &apos; &quot;[4569] B 2
The Government expenditure, of these belligerent countries has increased; in proportions, which vary between 500 and 1,500 per cent.,ihe present figures amounting to between 20 and 4.0 per cent, of the total national income. The higher of these percentages represents the expenditure of France, who includes in her budget a very large sum for the restoration of her devastated provinces.In all cases vigorous efforts have been made to introduce an orderly fiscal system into State finance by the imposition of fresh taxation-mostly in the form of direct taxes and the ordinary revenues are in most cases now equal to, or not far short oft the ordinary expenditure. But, except in the case of Great Britain, there is still a very large gap between the total income and expenditure.these countries together have lost a very large proportion of their pre-war holdings of gold, and have enormously increased their paper currencies. This process of inflation, which has been reduced by Great Britain and checked by France, still continues in other countries. Except in the case of Germany and her allies, whose imports were prevented by the blockade, all those countries have during the war had an enormous excess of imports over exports. This excess increased in some cases after the armistice, but is now diminishing. Indeed, in almost every case there is now a perceptible growth of exports.During the war the exchanges of these countries did not reflect their real economic position, as artificial measures were in most cases taken to stabilise them; but the exchanges rapidly deteriorated when these measures were given up in 1919. This depreciation continued for twelve months. Since the spring of this year there have been appreciable variations, but on the balance the net movement has been towards improvement.As a result of the war a number of new States have been created, while certain existing States, some of which were belligerents, have had their territories profoundly modified. Among these are Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Esthonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Roumania, and Serbia. For none of these countries, except Finland, is there a definite basis of comparison. All of them have received as a legacy of the war extremely depreciated currencies. In most cases. the machinery of an orderly State revenue system is not yet in operation, and with enormous expenditure upon food relief, armaments, and in some cases actual war, there is no sign yet of any possibility of a budget equilibrium. In many of these countries the printing press is still in operation. On the other hand, several of thexa are predominantly agricultural. Their productive powers may recover rapidly, and a single good harvest-especially with the present high price Of food is likely to strengthen,both their financial and their economic position. In the case of Austria, whose economic life has been more completely disintegrated than elsewhere,, the situation is peculiarly difficult.In. the countries of Europe which were neutral during the war, including Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Luexmburg, Norway, Spain and Switzerland, the position is essentially different; but the financial difficulties are also serious. In some cases heavy expenditure was incurred by these countries directly in consequence of the war, and they have had largely to increase their internal debt. But in most cases the budget difficulties are due to the growth of Government expenditure caused by the rise of prices and the provision of subsidies to prevent this rise pressing too heavily on the general population, This expenditure has in some cases been met by increased taxation, but in the case of Holland, Switzerland and Spain there are considerable deficits, and in the two latter cases no equilibrium is yet in sight. The trade position of these countries also presents peculiar difficulties. During the war their trade balances were very favourable owing to the demand for their products from the belligerent nations, and the stoppage of their imports. The result was an accumulation of gold, which led to an expansion of currency and a rise of prices almost as serious as that which for entirely different reasons took place in the belligerent countries. Since the war the trade situation has been reversed, as these countries have been importing the goods required to replenish stocks and, owing in part to the premium to which their exchanges have risen, as compared with the depreciated currencies of the belligerent nations, the maintenance of their exports has become difficult. To some extent, therefore, the favourable factors in the situation of these countries are actually an embarrassment.The countries outside Europe have on the whole the most favourable economic position. Though special conditions affect certain of -them-especially China-in general it may be said that they have benefited by the ready disposal of their products to the nations of Europe.  Their trade balances have been very favourable, and their
exchanges have improved relatively to those of European countries, They have in many cases been able to pay off a large proportion of their external debts, and on the ether hand have made large loans to their former creditors. This is particularly the case with the United States, to whom most of the countries of Europe are now heavily indebted. But, as in the case of European neutrals, their accumulation of gold has led to a rise in prices and has rendered more difficult the maintenance of their exports. Their future economic position, therefore, is vitally dependent on the restoration of the purchasing power of their European customers. It must also be kept in view that many of these countries, especially in the new hemisphere, have immense unfulfilled demands for capital expenditure, and the world-wide shortage of capital at the present time constitutes a serious handicap to their development.It is noteworthy, however, that different as are the conditions in these different groups of countries, certain features are common to practically every country of the world as a consequence of the destruction and dislocation of the war. In every country the purchasing power of the national currency has diminished, and the cost of living in terms of that currency has increased. With a few exceptions, neutral as well as belligerent countries suspended the gold basis of their currency. Even where the gold basis has been retained, the purchasing value of the currency has declined, for the value of gold itself in terms of commodities has diminished to about one-half. In every country international trade has been impeded, dislocated and diverted from its normal channels. The inability of Europe to export during the war forced the normal purchasers of her goods to look elsewhere for their requirements, to develop production in unaccustomed channels at home or in other countries overseas. Simultaneously Europe&apos;s need for imports compelled the sale of her capital holdings abroad, which are not therefore now available for her present needs. The instability and depreciation of exchanges resulting from these and other causes have impeded the trade of both seller and buyer. Countries with unfavourable exchanges have found it difficult to. buy raw materials and those with favourable exchanges have found in them an obstacle to the sale of their exports. With half the world producing less than it consumes and having insufficient exports to pay for its imports, credits alone can bridge the gulf between seller and buyer, and credits are rendered difficult by the very causes which make them necessary. Finally, every country finds impediments to its international trade in the new economic barriers which have been imposed during and since the war.II. The Limits of Financial Remedies.Such in the briefest outline is the economic and financial condition of the world which was presented to the Conference in vivid detail by the Reports from the thirty-nine countries attending it.The members of the Conference were conscious that, limited to the sphere of finance both by their terms of reference and their personal qualifications, they could only deal with a part of the problem which faced the Governments and the peoples of the world.Finance is, after all, only a reflection of commercial and economic life a part only, though an essential part, of its mechanism. The wealth of the world consists of the products of man&apos;s work, and the sum total of human prosperity can be increased only by an increase of production. All that any official or organised action can do is to create conditions which are favourable to production, and of those the most important fall outside the sphere of finance.First and foremost the world needs peace. The Conference affirms most emphatically that the first condition for the world&apos;s recovery is the restoration of real peace, the conclusion of the wars which are still being waged and the assured maintenance of peace for the future. The continuance of the atmosphere of war and of preparations for war is fatal to the development of that mutual trust which is essential to the resumption of normal trading relations.The world must resolve the rivalries and animosities which have been the inevitable legacy of the struggle by which Europe has been torn. This, the Conference ventures to hope, is no vain aspiration. The fact that for the first time since 1914 representatives of belligerents and neutrals alike have met in conference is a good ..omen for the future.The world needs the inauguration of a new era of co-operation and goodwill between nations if it is to repair the destruction of those years of struggle, if indeed it is ever to secure the survival of its civilisation.
If the first condition of recovery is peaCe between the countries of the world, the next is peace within each1 of them and the establishment of conditions which will allay the social unrest that is at present impeding and reducing production, and which will restore social content and with it the will and the desire to work.Among the conditions, however, which, are essential if a maximum production is to be attained is the existence of a system which facilitates the exchange of commodities and their equitable distribution and within this third sphere lies the task of finance and the especial problems which the Conference has had to consider.III. Recommendations of the Conference.The Conference divided the work involved in the examination of these problems into four parts and entrusted special Commissions of its members with the task of making a detailed study and preparing specific recommendations with regard to (a) public finance and (b) currency and exchange, (c) international trade and commerce and (d) international action with special reference to credits.The recommendations of these Committees which have been unanimously approved by the Conference are given in full at the end of this Report and they require to be considered as a whole with the detailed arguments on which they are based.The substance of these recommendations may be summarised as follows : (a.) General Financial Considerations.The first step is to bring public opinion in every country to realise the essential facts of the situation, and particularly the need of re-establishing public finances on a sound basis as a p reliminary to the execution of those social reforms which the world demands.Nearly every Government is being pressed to incur fresh expenditure largely on palliatives, which aggravate the very evils against which they are directed. The country which accepts the policy of budget deficits is treading the slippery path which leads to general ruin; to escape from that path no sacrifice is too great.The statements presented to the Conference show that, on an average, some 20 per cent, of the national expenditure is still being devoted to the maintenance of armaments and to preparations for war. The Conference desires to affirm with the utmost emphasis that the world cannot afford this expenditure. Only by a frank policy of mutual co-operation can the nations hope to regain their old prosperity, and to secure that result the whole resources of each country must be devoted to strictly productive purposes. The Conference: accordingly recommends most earnestly to the Council of the League of Nations the desirability of conferring at once with the several Governments concerned, with a view to securing a general and agreed reduction of the crushing burden which, on their existing scale, armaments still impose on the impoverished people of the world, sapping their resources and imperilling their recovery from the ravages of war. The Conference hopes that the Assembly of the League which is about to meet will take energetic action to this end.It is also of the greatest importance that every Government should abandon at the earliest practicable date all uneconomical and artificial measures which conceal from the people the true economic situation.To enable Governments, however, to give effect to the principles of sound finance all classes of the community must contribute their share. Industry must be so organised as to encourage the maximum production on the part both of capital and of labour, as by such production alone will those improved conditions of life be obtained which it is the aim of every country to secure for its people. All classes of the population, and particularly the wealthy, must be prepared willingly to accept the charges necessary to remedy the.present situation. Above all, to fill up the gap between the supply of, and the demand for, commodities, it is the duty of every patriotic citizen to practise the strictest possible economy, and so to contribute his maximum effort to the common weal. Such private action is the indispensable basis for the fiscal measures required to restore public finances.The Conferences, moreover, strongly endorses the declaration of the Supreme Council of the 8th March last &quot; that the States which have been created or enlarged as the result of the war should at once re-establish full and friendly co-operation, and arrange for the unrestricted interchange of commodities, in order that the essential unity of European economic life may not be impaired by the erection of artificial economic barriers.&quot; Each country should aim at the progressive restoration of that freedom of commerce which prevailed before the war, including the withdrawal of artificial restrictions on, and discriminations of price against, external trade.
(b.) Revenue and Expenditure, &apos;c-. Where it is impossible to keep expenditure within limits of existing revenue, fresh taxation must: be imposed to meet the deficit, and this process must be ruthlessly continued until the revenue is at least sufficient, to meet the full amount of the recurrent ordinary expenditure. The relative advantages of the various possible methods of taxation depencj oh the special economic conditions obtaining in each country, and each country must decide for itself on the methods best suited to its own internal economy.In future, the loans which are required for urgent capital purposes must be met out of the real savings of the&apos;people. But these savings have, as it were, been pledged for many years ahead bv the credits created during the war, and the first step to raising fresh money must be to fund the Undigested floating obligations with&apos;which the markets are burdened.&quot; &apos;&apos; &apos;,: v&apos;   (c.) Cessation of Inflation.     .&apos;    &apos;% It is of the utmost, importance that the growth of &quot; inflation &quot; should be stopped. It should be clearly understood that this artificial and unrestrained expansion of the currency does not and,cannot add to the total real purchasing power in existence, so that its effect must be to reduce the purchasing power of each unit of the currency; Inflation is, in fact, an unscientific and ill-adjusted method of taxation.The effect of it has been to intensify, in terms of the inflated currencies, the general rise in prices, so that a greater, amount of such currency is needed to procure the accustomed supplies of goods and services. Where this additional currency was procured by further &quot; inflation &quot; (i.e., by printing more paper money or creating fresh credit) there arose what has been called a &quot;vicious spiral &quot; of constantly rising prices and wages, and constantly, increasing inflation, with the resulting disorganisation-tion of all business, dislocation of the exchange&apos;,, a progressive increase in the cost of living and consequent labour unrest.It is highly desirable, that the countries which have lapsed from an effective gold standard should return thereto. It is impossible to say how or when all the older countries would be able to return to their former measure of effective gold standard or how long it would take the newly-formed countries to establish such a standard. But in the opinion of the Conference it is useless, to attempt to fix the ratio of existing fiduciary currencies to their normal gold value. Unless the condition of the country concerned were sufficiently favourable to make the fixing of such a ratio unnecessary, it could not be maintained.The reversion to, or establishment of, an effective gold standard by any means other than devaluation would in many cases demand enormous deflation, and it is certain that such deflation, if and when undertaken, must be carried out graduallv and with great caution. Otherwise the disturbance to trade and credit might prove disastrous.The Conference does not recommend any attempt to stabilise the value of gold, and gravely doubts whether any such attempt could succeed. It believes that neither an international currency nor an internationalunit of account would serve any useful purpose or remove any of the difficulties from which international exchange suffers to-day.(d.)1 Central Banks of Issue.The Conference is of opinion that, in countries where there is no central Bank of Issue, one should be established, and if the assistance of foreign capital were required for the promotion of such a bank, some form of international control might be necessary.Attempts to limit fluctuations in exchange by imposing artificial control on exchange operations are futile and mischievous. In so far as they are effective they falsify the market, tend to remove natural correctives to such fluctuations and inter-fere with free dealings in forward exchange which are so necessary to enable traders to eliminate from their calculations a margin to cover the risks of exchange, which would otherwise contribute to the rise in prices.      , ,(e.) External Credits.The Conference recognises, however, that any general improvement in the situa-tion requires a considerable period of time, and that in present circumstances, it&apos;is not possible for certain countries to restore their economic activity without assistance from abroad. This assistance is required for periods which exceed the normal term of commercial operations * ; - .. . : M:&apos;  &apos;r;&apos; ;&apos; &apos;  &apos; &apos;
This assistance, however, can only be effectively accorded to countries which are prepared to co-operate with one another in the restoration of economic life and to make every effort to bring about within their own frontiers the sincere collaboration of all groups of citizens and to secure conditions which give to work and thrift liberty to produce their full results.the Conference does not believe that, apart from the particular decisions dictated by national interests or by considerations of humanity, credits should be accorded directly by Governments.(f.) New Credit Organisation.The Conference makes the following recommendations. An International Organisation should be formed and placed at the disposal of States desiring to have resort to credit for the purpose of paying for their essential imports. These States would then notify the assets which they are prepared to pledge as security for the sake of obtaining these credits and would come to an understanding with the Inter-y national Organisation as to the conditions under which these assets would be administered.The bonds issued against this guarantee would be used as collateral for credits intended to cover the cost of commodities.A plan, the details of which are set out in the Annexe to this report, is unani-mously recommended by the Conference, which considers that a Committee of financiers and business men should be nominated forthwith by the Council of the League of Nations for the purpose of defining the measures necessary to give practical effect to this proposal.(g.) Export Credit Insurance.An extension on international lines of the existing system of export credit insur-ance would also in many instances be of great value in developing trade with countries where the uncertainty of political and social conditions give rise to a lack of confidence. The Conference believes that an extension of this system is worthy of consideration, and that it should be further examined in detail by experts.(h.) Finishing Credits.The attention of the Conference has also been called to the present system of &quot; finishing credits,&quot; that is to say, of credits under which a lien in favour of the exporter or a banker is maintained on the raw material in all its different stages and upon the proceeds of the manufactured article.The Council of the League, is recommended to draw the attention of the different Governments to this question and to summon an advisory body of legal experts and business men to specify the legislative action needed to attain the desired object in each of the countries concerned.(i.) Miscellaneous Proposals.Apart from the above-mentioned proposals, the Conference believes that the activities of the League might usefully be directed towards promoting certain reforms, and collecting the relevant information required to facilitate credit operations. In this connection the Conference considers it well to draw attention to the advantages of making progress under each of the following heads: , Unification of the laws relating to bills of exchange and bills of lading. The reciprocal treatment of the branches of foreign banks in different countries. The publication of financial information in a clear comparative form. The examination of claims by the holders of bonds, the interest on which is in arrear.An international understanding on the subject of. lost, stolen or destroyed securities.The establishment of an international clearing house.An international understanding which, while ensuring the due payment by everyone of his full share of taxation, would avoid the imposition of double taxation which is at present an obstacle to the placing of investments abroad.It will be seen that these recommendations involve both internal action by the several Governments and also international co-operation. For the measures taken in their respective countries the several ^Governments are and must of course remain1
responsible, though on certain questions the Conference has ventured respectfully to tender to them its advice.The Conference is unanimous, however, in believing that national action is not by itself sufficient. International co-operation, of which the Conference itself is the first effort and example, must continue and develop, and in this the League of Nations must take the initiative. The specific recommendations now made, such as the proposal to form a new International Credits Organisation, are only instances of the measures of international co-operation which require to be elaborated in more detail.The work of the present Conference has been a commencement only. It will be necessary to follow up the diagnosis now arrived at by a systematic study of the comparative progress made in the solution of the present difficulties and by continued collaboration in devising new proposals to meet new circumstances as they develop. For this purpose and for the work of a continuous character which each of the Commissions has recommended within its own sphere, a permanent organisation will be necessary, and it may be desirable for the Conference itself to meet again at a later date.In this connection, the terms of reference of the present Conference were, as already stated, limited by the Council of the League. The Conference has never sought to overstep the limits which the Council of the League of Nations set to the scope of its deliberations. It, however, feels justified in associating itself with the hope expressed by M. Leon Bourgeois in his Report to the Council of the 5th April last, to the effect that the economic uncertainty which besets alike the countries which are entitled to receive and the countries which are under an obligation to pay reparation claims may speedily be removed, since the settlement of this question is indispensable not only for the reconstruction of the countries devastated by the war a matter of capital importance to the re-establishment of Europe&apos;s economic equilibrium but also for the recovery of the States on whom the burden of this reparation lies.IV. The Unanimous Character of the Recommendations.Some of the recommendations of the Conference may appear axiomatic in character rather than original contributions to the financial problem of the world. Their adoption, however, would mean a fundamental change in the policies of the great majority of European countries. It may for example seem almost a platitude to say that it is essential that Governments should meet their ordinary current expenditure out of their ordinary current revenue, and that, if they do not do so, the inflation and an increased cost of living are inevitable. In nearly three out of four of the countries represented at the Conference, however, and in nearly eleven out of twelve of European countries, budgets do not at present balance, and many of them show no prospect of doing so in the near future. In these circumstances the recommendations made collectively and unanimously by the Conference may perhaps claim a special force and significance.The members of the Conference venture to call special attention to the way in which, selected by the Governments of thirty-nine countries representing about 75 per cent, of the population of the world, they have been able through this fort-night&apos;s discussion to arrive at a general agreement as to the main features of the world5s economic and financial position, and some at least of the most important measures urgently required for its restoration. They therefore have been able to give to their suggestions the force of collective and unanimous recommendations.Whatever may be the future of our positive proposals, the Conference cannot have been in vain. It has been a gathering unique in the history of the world. It has been not a gathering of statesmen working at the solution of political difficulties in the interest of their particular countries; it has been a gathering of experts from all nations working for the solution of the common problem of the whole world. Such differences and divergencies of view as may have existed were brought to the common stock, and all alike have benefited by the interchange of views which resulted. As the work of the Conference and its Commissions proceeded there developed a spirit of,close and intimate co-operation such as might scarcely have been thought possible. That co-operation is in itself a factor of the utmost importance. Each country has had the opportunity of presenting to the rest of the world its special difficulties, its particular anxieties, and all have contributed towards finding a solution.[4569] C
II.INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CONFERENCE. Committee on Public Finance. Resolutions. 1.Thirty-nine nations have in turn placed before the International Financial Conference a statement of their financial position. The examination of these state-ments brings out the extreme gravity of the general situation of public finance throughout the world, and particularly in Europe. Their import may be summed up in the statement that three out of every four of the countries represented at this Conference, and eleven out of twelve of the European countries, anticipate a Budget deficit in the present year. Public opinion is largely responsible for this situation. The close connection between these Budget deficits and the cost of living, which is causing such suffering and unrest throughout the world, is far from being grasped. Nearly every Government is being pressed to incur fresh expenditure; largely on palliatives which aggravate the very evils against which they are directed. The first step is to bring public opinion in every country to realise the essential facts of the situation, and particularly the need of re-establishing public finances on a sound basis as a preliminary to the execution of those social reforms which the world demands.2.Public attention should be especially drawn to the fact that the reduction of prices and the restoration of prosperity is dependent on the increase of production, and that the continual excess of Government expenditure over revenue represented by Budget deficits is one of the most serious obstacles to such increase of production, as it must sooner or later involve the following consequences : (a.) A further inflation of credit and currency.(6.) A further depreciation in the purchasing power of the domestic currency,and a still greater instability of the foreign exchanges, (c.) A further rise in prices and in the cost of living.The country which accepts the policy of Budget deficits is treading the slippery path which leads to general ruin; to escape from that path, no sacrifice is too great.3.It is therefore imperative that every Government should, as the first social and financial reform, on which all others depend :-(a.) Restrict its ordinary recurrent expenditure, including the service of the debt, to such an amount as can be covered by its ordinary revenue.(h) Rigidly reducing all expenditure on armaments in so far as such reduction is compatible with the preservation of national security.(c.) Abandon all unproductive extraordinary expenditure.(d.) Restrict even productive extraordinary expenditure to the lowest possible amount.4.The Supreme Council of the Allied Powers in its pronouncement on the 8th March declared that &quot; armies should everywhere be reduced to a joeace footing, that armaments should be limited to the lowest possible figure compatible with national security, and that the League of Nations should be invited to consider, as soon as possible, proposals to this end.&quot; The statements presented to the Conference show that on an average some 20 per cent, of the national expenditure is still being devoted to the&apos;maintenance of armaments and the preparations for war. The Conference desires to affirm with the utmost emphasis that the world cannot afford this expenditure. Only by a frank policy of mutual co-operation can the nations hope to regain their old prosperity; and in order to secure that result the whole resources
of each country must be devoted to strictly productive purposes. The Conference accordingly recommends most earnestly to the Council of the League of Nations the desirability of conferring at once with the several Governments concerned, with a view to securing a general and agreed reduction of the crushing burden which, on their existing scale, armaments still impose on the impoverished peoples of the world, sapping their resources and imperilling their recovery from the ravages of war. The Conference hopes that the Assembly of the League which is about to meet will take energetic action to this end.5.While recognising the practical difficulties in the way of immediate action, in all cases, the Conference considers that every Government should abandon at the earliest practicable date all uneconomical and artificial measures which conceal from the people the true economic situation; such measures include : (a.) The artificial cheapening of bread and other foodstuffs, and of coal and other materials, by selling them below cost price to the public, and the provision of unemployment doles of such a. character as to demoralise instead of encouraging industry.(6.) The maintenance of railway fares, postal rates and charges for other Government services on a basis which is insufficient to cover the cost of the services given, including annual charges on capital account.- 6.In so far as, after every effort has been made, it is impossible to cut down expenditure within the limits of existing revenues, fresh taxation must be imposed to meet the deficit, and this process must be ruthlessly continued until the revenue is at least sufficient to meet the full amount of the recurrent ordinary expenditure. The Conference considers that the relative advantages of the various possible means of increasing the national revenue, whether by direct or indirect taxation or by a capital levy (to be devoted to the repayment of debt), depend upon the special economic conditions obtaining in each country, and that in consequence each country must decide for itself on the methods which are best suited to its own internal economy.7.If the above principles are accepted and applied, loans will not be required for recurrent ordinary expenditure; borrowing for that purpose must cease. In a number of countries, however, although the ordinary charges can be met from revenue, heavy extraordinary expenditure must at the present time be undertaken on capital account. This applies more especially in the case of those countries devastated during the war, whose reconstruction charges cannot possibly be met from ordinary receipts. The restoration of the devastated areas is of capital importance for the re-establishment of normal economic conditions; and loans for this purpose are not only unavoidable but justifiable. But in view of the shortage of capital it will be difficult to secure the sums required even for this purpose, and only the most urgent schemes should be pressed forward immediately.8.The means by which loans are raised are no less important than the purposes to which they are destined. In future the loans which are required for urgent capital purposes must be met out of the real savings of the people. But those savings have, as it were, been pledged for many years ahead by the credits created during the war, and the first step to raising fresh money must be to fund the undigested floating obligations with which the markets are burdened. Those principles apply both to internal and to external borrowing, and in regard to the latter, we suggest that it would be in the general interest for the creditor countries to give such facilities as may be possible to the debtor countries to fund their floating obligations at the earliest possible date.9.In order to enlist public interest it is essential to give the greatest publicity possible to the situation of the public finances of each. State.The Conference is, therefore, of the opinion that the work already accomplished by the secretariat in its comparative study of public finances should be continued,
and it suggests that the Council of the League of Nations should request all its members and all the nations represented at this Conference to furnish it regularly not only with Budget estimates and final Budget figures, but also with a half-yearly account of actual receipts and expenditure. At the same time, countries should be urged to supply as complete information as possible on the existing system of taxation, and any suggestions which may appear to each State to be useful for the financial education of the public opinion of the world.With the aid of the information thus obtained the League of Nations would be enabled to prepare (pamphlets for) periodical publications setting out the compara-tive financial position of the countries of the world, and making clear the various systems of taxation in force.10.The Conference is of opinion that the strict application of the principles outlined above is the necessary condition for the re-establishment of public finances on a sound basis&apos;.. A country which does not contrive as soon as possible to attain the execution of those principles is doomed beyond hope of recovery. To enable Governments, however, to give effect to these principles, all classes of the community must contribute their share. Industry must be so organised as to encourage the maximum production on the part both of capital and of labour, as by such production alone will labour be able to obtain those improved conditions of life which it is the aim of every country to secure for its people. All classes of the population, and particularly the wealthy, must be prepared willingly to accept the charges necessary to remedy the present situation. Above all, to fill up the gap between the supply of and the demand for commodities, it is the duty of every patriotic citizen to practise the strictest possible economy and so to contribute his maximum effort to the common weal. Such private action is the indispensable basis for the fiscal measures required to restore public finances.III.INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CONFERENCE. Committee on Currency and Exchange. Report.The currency of a country, in the sense of the immediate purchasing power of the community, includes (a) the actual legal tender money in existence, and (b) any promises to pay legal tender, e.g., as bank balances, which are available for ordinary daily transactions.The currencies of all the belligerent and of many other countries, though in greatly varying degrees, have since the beginning of the war been expanded artificially, regardless of the usual restraints upon such expansion (to which we refer later), and without any corresponding increase in the real wealth upon which their purchasing power was based; indeed, in most cases in spite of a serious reduction in such wealth.It should be clearly understood that this artificial and unrestrained expansion, or &quot; inflation &quot; as it is called, of the currency or of the titles to immediate purchasing power, does not and cannot add to the total real purchasing power in existence, so that its effect must be to reduce the purchasing power of each unit of the currency. It is in fact a form of debasing the currency.The effect of it has been to intensify, in terms of the inflated currencies, the general rise in prices, so that a greater amount of such currency is needed to procure the accustomed supply of goods and services. Where this additional currency was procured by further &quot; inflation &quot; (i.e.y by printing more paper money or creating fresh credit) there arose what has been called a &quot; vicious spiral&quot; of constantly rising prices and wages and constantly increasing inflation with the resulting disorganisation of all business, dislocation of the exchanges, a progressive increase in the cost of living and consequent labour unrest.
Therefore(1) It is of the utmost importance that the growth of inflation should be stopped, and this, although no doubt very difficult to do immediately in some countries, could quickly be accomplished by (1) abstaining from increasing the currency (in its broadest sense as defined above), and (2) by increasing the real wealth upon which such currency is based.The cessation of increase in the currency should not be achieved merely by restricting the issue of legal tender. Such a stepi, if unaccompanied by other measures, would be apt to aggravate the situation by causing a monetary crisis. It is necessary to attack the causes which lead to the necessity for the additional currency.The chief cause in most countries is that the Governments finding themselves unable to meet their expenditures out of revenue, have been tempted to resort to the artificial creation of fresh purchasing power, either by the direct issue of additional legal tender money, or more frequently by obtaining especially from the Banks of Issue, who in some cases are unable and in others unwilling to refuse them credits which must themselves be satisfied in legal tender money. We say, therefore, that(2) Governments must limit their expenditure to their revenue (we are not considering here the finance of reconstructing devastated areas).(3) Banks, and especially Banks of Issue, should be freed from political pressure and should be conducted solely on the lines of prudent &quot;finance.But the Governments are not the only offenders in this respect; other parties, and especially in some countries the municipalities and other local authorities, have raised excessive credits which in the same way multiply the titles to purchasing power.Nor will it be sufficient, for the purpose of checking further inflation, that additional issues of legal tender or the granting of additional credits should cease; since the floating debts of Government and other authorities constitute in themselves a form of potential currency, in that, except in so far as they are constantly renewed, their amount will come to swell the total currency in existence.  Consequently(4) The creation of additional credit should cease and Governments and muni-cipalities should not only not increase their floating debts but should begin to repay or fund them by degrees.In normal times the natural and most effective regulator of the volume and distribution of credit is the rate of interest which the central Banks of Issue are compelled, in self-preservation and in duty to the community, to raise when credit is unduly expanding. It is true that high money rates would be expensive to Governments which have large floating debts, but we see no reason why the community in its collective capacity (i.e., the Governments) should be less subject to the normal measure for restricting credit than the individual members of the community. In some countries, however, the financial machinery has become so abnormal that it may be difficult for such corrective measures to be immediately applied. We recommend, therefore, that(5) Until credit can be controlled merely by the normal influence of the rate of interest it should only be granted for real economic needs.It is impossible to lay down any rule as to the &quot; proper rates &quot; of discount or interest for different countries. These rates will depend not only on the supply and demand at different times, but also on other factors often of a psychological nature. It may indeed confidently be said that when once the arbitrary increase of inflation ceases and when the Banks of Issue are able successfully to perform their normal functions, rates will find their own proper level.The complementary steps for arresting the increase of inflation by increasing the wealth on which the currency is based, may be summed up in the words:. Increased production and decreased consumption.The most intensive production possible is required in order to make good the waste of war and arrest inflation, and thus to reduce the cost of living; yet we are witnessing in many countries production below the normal together with those frequent strikes which aggravate instead of helping to cure the present shortage and dearness of commodities. When diminution in the Governments&apos; demands frees more credits for trade and for the recuperation of the world, when inflation has ceased and prices cease to rise and when the general unsettlement caused by the war subsides it is probable that great improvement will be seen in productive activity. Yet in our opinion the production of wealth is in many countries suffering from a cause which it is more directly in the power of Governments to remove, viz., the control in various forms which was often imposed by them as a war measure and has [4569j 1 D
not yet been completely relaxed. In some cases business has even been taken by Government out of the hands of the private trader whose enterprise and experience are a far more potent instrument for the recuperation of the country.Another urgent need is the freest possible international exchange of commodities. With this another Committee will deal, but we feel that our recommendations here on inflation would not be complete without adding that(6) Commerce should as soon as possible be freed from control and impediments to international trade removed.Equally urgent is the necessity for decreased consumption in an impoverished world where so much has been destroyed and where productive power has been impaired. It is therefore specially important at present that both on public and private account, and not only in impoverished countries, but in every part of the world,(7) All superfluous expenditure should be avoided.To attain this end the enlightenment of public opinion is the most powerful lever. If the wise control of credit brings dear money, this result will in itself help to promote economy.We pass now from inflation and its remedies to the other points submitted to us.Without entering into the question whether gold is or is not the ideal common standard of value, we consider it most important that the world should have some common standard, and that as gold is to-day the nominal standard of the civilised world(8) It is highly desirable that the countries which have lapsed from an effective gold standard should return thereto.It is impossible to say how or when all the older countries would be able to return to their former measure of effective gold standard or how long it would take the newly-formed countries to establish such a standard.   But in our opinion(9) It is useless to attempt to fix the ratio of existing fiduciary currencies to their nominal gold value; as unless the condition of the country concerned were sufficiently favourable to make the fixing of such ratio unnecessary, it could not be maintained.The reversion to, or establishment of, an effective gold standard would in many cases demand enormous deflation, and it is certain that such(10) Deflation, if and when undertaken, must be carried out gradually and with great caution, otherwise the disturbance to trade and credit might prove disastrous.(11) We cannot recommend any attempt to stabilise the value of gold, and we gravely doubt whether such attempt could succeed; but this question might well be submitted to the Committee to which we refer later if it should be appointed.(12) We believe that neither an International Currency nor an International Unit of Account would serve any useful purpose or remove any of the difficulties from which International Exchange suffers to-day.(13) We can find no justification for supporting the idea that foreign holders of bank notes or bank balances should be treated differently to native holders.(14) In countries where there is no central Bank of Issue one should be established, and if the assistance of foreign capital were required for the promotion of such a bank some form of international control might be required.(15) Attempts to limit fluctuations in exchange by imposing artificial control on exchange operations are futile and mischievous. In so far as they are effective they falsify the market, tend to remove natural correctives to such fluctuations and interfere with free dealings in forward exchange which are so necessary to enable traders to eliminate from their calculations a margin to cover risk of exchange, which would otherwise contribute to the rise in prices. Moreover, all Government inter-ference with trade, including exchange, tends to impede that improvement of the economic conditions of a country by which alone a Wealthy and stable exchange can. be secured.We support the suggestion that(16) A Committee should be set up both for continuing the collection of the valuable financial statistics that have been furnished for this Conference and also for the further investigation of currency policy.-
IY.INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CONFERENCE. International Trade Committee. Resolutions (carried unanimously). 1.The International Financial Conference affirms that the first condition for the resumption of international trade is the restoration of real peace, the conclusion of the wars which are still being waged, and the assured maintenance of peace for the future. The continuance of the atmosphere of war and of preparations for war is fatal to the development of that mutual trust which is essential to the resumption of normal trading relations. . The security of internal conditions is scarcely less important, as foreign trade cannot prosper in a country whose internal conditions do not inspire confidence. The Conference trusts that the League of Nations will lose no opportunity to secure the full restoration and continued maintenance of peace.2.The International Financial Conference affirms that the improvement of the financial position largely depends on the general restoration, as soon as possible, of goodwill between the various nations; and in particular it endorses the declaration of the Supreme Council of the 8th March last, &quot; that the States which have been created or enlarged as the result of the war should at once re-establish full and friendly co-operation and arrange for the unrestricted interchange of commodities in order that the essential unity of European economic life may not be impaired by the erection of artificial economic barriers.&quot;3.The Conference recommends that, within such limits and at such time as may appear possible, each country should aim at the progressive restoration of that freedom of commerce which prevailed before the war, including the withdrawal of artificial restrictions on, and discriminations of price against, external trade.The International Financial Conference expresses its conviction that the instability of exchanges constitutes a great hindrance to the resumption of normal international trade.5. . I IThe International Financial Conference would welcome any action which can be taken by the League of Nations to enable the countries, which under present conditions cannot purchase the necessary supplies for their reconstruction, temporarily to obtain commercial credits on an approved basis for this purpose.6.The International Financial Conference expresses the conviction that the repair,, improvement and economical use of the transport systems of the world, and particularly of countries affected by the war, are of vital importance to the restoration of international trade.[4569]
Y.INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CONFERENCE.Committee on Inteenational Credits. Resolutions. 1.The Fourth Committee recognises in the first place that the difficulties which at present lie in the way of international credit operations arise almost exclusively out of the disturbance caused by the war, and that the normal working of financial markets cannot be completely re-established unless peaceful relations are restored between all peoples and the outstanding financial questions resulting from the war are made the subject of a definite settlement which is put into execution.2.The Committee is, moreover, of opinion that the revival of credit requires as primary conditions the restoration of order in public finance, the cessation of inflation, the purging of currencies, and the freedom of commercial transactions. The conclusions of this Committee are therefore based on the work of the other Committees.3.The Committee recognises, however, that this general improvement in the situation requires a considerable period of time, and that in present circumstances it is not possible for certain countries to restore their economic activity without assistance from abroad. This assistance is required for periods which exceed the normal term of commercial operations.4.The Committee is of opinion that in principle the resources out of which this assistance is to be provided should be found from the savings of the lending countries, and must nob result in undue increase of the fiduciary circulation that is to say, in the creation or extension of a disproportion between means of payment and the genuine requirements of business.5.The Committee believes, on the other hand, that this assistance can only be effectively accorded to countries which are prepared to assist one another in the restoration of economic life, and to make every effort to bring about within their own frontiers the sincere, collaboration of all groups of citizens, and to secure. conditions which give to work and thrift liberty to produce their full results.6.The Committee does not believe that, apart from particular decisions dictated by national interests or by considerations of humanity, credits should be accorded directly by Governments.7.It appears to the Committee that one of the chief obstacles to the granting of credits is the absence in borrowing countries of sufficient security for ultimate repayment. The Committee therefore studied with attention in the light of the general considerations enumerated above all the proposals presented, with a view to creating guarantees which world provide satisfactory security for exporters.The Committee has been forced to recognise that no single system could by itself suffice to provide for the many different needs of the various countries^ and that it is necessary to indicate a series of measures sufficiently elastic to be adapted afterwards to every variety of circumstances.
For these reasons the Committee decided to make the following recom-mendations: 8.An international organisation should be formed and placed at the disposal of States desiring to have resort to credit for the purpose of paying for their essential imports. These States would then notify the assets which they are prepared to pledge as security for the sake of obtaining credit, and would come to an under-standing with the international organisation as to the conditions under which these assets would be administered.The bonds issued against this guarantee would be used as collateral for credits intended to cover the cost of commodities.A plan based upon these principles is developed in Annex A. It has been devised to enable States to facilitate the obtaining of commercial credits by their nationals. It is easy to see that the scheme is susceptible of development in various directions, and that some of its provisions might be adapted so as to facilitate the extension of credit direct to public corporations.A committee of financiers and business men should be nominated forthwith by the Council of the League of Nations for the purpose of defining the measures necessary to give practical effect to this proposal.9.It has been represented to the Committee that more complete results might be achieved if the bonds used as collateral were to carry some international guarantee.The Committee sees no objection to the further consideration of this proposal. The Committee referred to in paragraph 8 above might usefully consider the conditions under which it could be applied.10.It has also been represented to the Committee that an extension on international lines of the existing system of export credit insurance would in many instances be of great value in developing trade with countries where political and social conditions give rise to an anxiety which is often exaggerated by exporters. The Committee believes that an extension of this kind is worthy of consideration, and that it should be examined in detail by experts.11.The attention of the Committee has been called to the present system of finishing credits, that is to say, of credits under which a lien in favour of the exporter or a banker is maintained on the raw material in all its different stages and upon the proceeds of the manufactured article. This system has suffered greatly owing to the lack in many countries of sufficient legal protection for the exporter throughout the various stages of importation, manufacture, re-exportation and sale. The Committee would suggest that the Council be recommended to draw the attention of the different Governments to this question and to summon an advisory body, of legal experts and business men to specify the legislative action which it would be desirable to take in order to attain the desired object in each of the countries concerned.12.Apart from the above-mentioned proposals which the Committee recommends the League of Nations to adopt and if possible to apply in practice, the Committee believes that the activities of the League might usefully be directed towards promoting certain reforms, and collecting the relevant information required to facilitate credit operations. In this connection the Committee considers it well to draw attention to the advantages of making progress under each of the following heads :-(1.) Ratification of the laws relating to bills of exchange and bills of lading. (2.) The reciprocal treatment of the branches of foreign banks in different countries. j(3.) The publication of financial information in a clear, comparative form. (4.) The examination of claims by the holders of bonds, the interest on whichis in arrear.
(5.) An international understanding on the subject of lost, stolen or destroyed securities.(6.) The establishment of an international clearing house.(7.) An international understanding which, while ensuring the due payment by everyone of his full share of taxation, would avoid the imposition of double taxation which is at present an obstacle to the placing of invest-ments abroad.13.During the course of its deliberations the Committee could not fail to be impressed by the fact that all, or almost all, of the many proposals submitted for their consideration require at some stage the active intervention of the League of Nations. The Committee is unanimously in sympathy with this tendency and believes that it is desirable to extend to the problems of finance that international co-operation which the League of Nations has inaugurated and which it is attempting to promote in order to improve the general situation and maintain the peace of the world.A annex to Resolutions of Committee on International Credits.I. In order that impoverished nations, which under present circumstances are unable to obtain accommodation on reasonable terms in the open market, may be able to command the confidence necessary to attract funds for the. financing of their essential imports, an International Commission shall be constituted under the auspices of the League of Nations.2. The Commission shall consist of bankers and business men of international repute, appointed by the Council of the League of Nations.3. The Commission shall have the power to appoint Sub-Commissions and to devolve upon them the exercise of its authority in participating countries or in groups of participating countries.4. The Governments of countries desiring to participate shall notify to the Commission what specific assets they are prepared to assign as security for com-mer6ial credits to be granted by the nationals of exporting countries.5. The Commission, after examination of these assets, shall of its own authority determine the gold value of the credits which it would approve against the security of these assets.6. The participating Government shall then be authorised to prepare bonds to the gold value approved by the Commission, each in one specific currency to be determined on the issue of the bond.7. The date of maturity and the rate of interest to be borne by these bonds shall be determined by the participating Government in agreement with the Commission.8. The service of these bonds shall be secured out of the revenue of the assigned assets.9.. The assigned assets shall in the first instance be administered by the participating Government or by the International Commission as that Commission may in each case determine.10. The Commission shall at any time have the right of making direct, representations to the Council of the League of Nations as to the desirability of transferring the administration of the assigned assets either from the Commission to the participating Government,&apos; or from the participating Government to the Commission.II. The decision of the Council of the League of Nations on this question shall be binding.12. After the preparation of these bonds the participating Government shall have athe right to loan the bonds to its own nationals, for use by them as collateral security for importations.13. The bonds shall be made out in such currencies and in such denominations as are applicable to the particular transaction in respect of which they are issued.14. The participating Government shall be free to take or not to take security for the loan of these bonds from the nationals to whom they are lent.15. The maturity and the rate of interest of the loan of the bonds shall be fixed by agreement between the participating Government and the borrower of the bonds; they need not be the same as the maturity and the rate of interest of the bonds themselves.
16. When making application to his Government for a loan of these bonds, the importer must furnish proof that he has previously obtained from the International Commission express permission to enter into the transaction for which the bonds are to be given as collateral.17. Each bond, before it is handed over by the participating Government to the importer, shall be countersigned by the Commission in proof of registration.18. Having obtained the consent of the Commission and received from them the countersigned bonds, the importer will pledge these bonds to the exporter in a foreign country for the period of the transaction.19. The exporter will return to him on their due dates the coupons of the pledged bonds, and the bonds themselves on the completion of the transaction.20. On receipt of the coupons and the bonds respectively, the importer will return them to his Government.21. Bonds returned to the participating Government shall be cancelled and may subsequently be replaced by other bonds, either in the same or in a different currency, up to an equivalent amount.22. The exporter, or, if he has pledged the bonds, the institution with which he has repledged them, acting on his behalf, would be free, in the event of the importer not fulfilling the terms oi&apos; his contract, to hold until maturity the bonds given as collateral by the importer, or to sell them in accordance with the custom in his country in case of default.23. In the second alternative an option of repurchasing the bonds direct must first be given for a short period to the Government which issued them.24. If a sale is resorted to and results in a surplus beyond what is necessary to cover the claims of the exporter upon the importer, the exporter shall be held account-able for that surplus to the Government which issues the bonds.25. The revenues from the assigned assets shall be applied as follows to the service of the bonds.26. Out of these revenues the Commission or the participating Government, as the case may be, shall purchase foreign currencies sufficient to&apos; meet at their due date the coupons on all bonds at any time outstanding in the different foreign currencies.27. In addition they shall establish abroad in the appropriate currencies a sinking fund calculated to redeem at maturity 10 per cent, of the bonds outstanding in each of the different countries.28. Further, in addition to the amounts provided for payment of coupons and for the endowment of the sinking fund, they shall establish out of the assigned revenues a special reserve in one or more foreign currencies for the redemption of bonds sold in accordance with paragraph 22.29. The amount to be set aside for the special reserve shall in each case be determined by the Commission.30. Any surplus remaining at the end of each year after the provision of these services shall be at the free disposal of the participating Government,31. A participating Government shall have the right to offer its own bonds as collateral for credits obtained for the purpose of importations on Government account. The previous assent of the Commission will in these cases also be required for the particular importations desired by the participating Government.32. If a participating Government which has been in control of its assigned revenues should fail to fulfil its obligations, the exporter concerned will notify the Commission and the Commission will apply to the Council of the League of Nations for the transfer of the management of the assigned revenues to the Commission.33. The consent of the Commission is necessary whenever bonds secured on the assigned assets are given as collateral and shall as a rule be accorded only for the import of raw materials and primary necessities.34. The Commission may, however, at its discretion, sanction in advance the importation of specified quantities of such goods.35. Even in the case of imports under such a general sanction a notification of the particular transaction must be registered with the Commission.36. The assent of the Commission must also be obtained in every case to the term of the credit which it is proposed to open.o
