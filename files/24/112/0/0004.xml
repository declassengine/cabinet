This Document is the Property of-Sis Orttannic Majesty&apos;s Government.At &quot;Seoret.1428weroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India,23rd September 1920.(Received 25th, 12 noon.)I.F.O.C. 1906. Please refer to para. No. 10 of my telegram No. 332 S., dated 23rd March 1920^ Wano Wazirs. Military position in Mahsud country appears now secure, and we feel we cannot longer defer dealing with Wano Wazirs. We have decided therefore on following programme : First. . Preliminary Jirga will be summoned to receive terms which will consist of payment of tine, return of Government rifles, &amp;c, taken by them ; surrender of a fixed number of tribal rifles, and undertaking not to interfere with the construction of roads or the movement of Government troops, &amp;c, within their territory, together with other subsidiary terms. Wazirs will be required to attend after one month of subsequent final Jirga to accept terms announced, and as guarantee of intention of submission, to deposit a certain proportion of fine required. After which reasonable period will be given for full compliance, with terms. In the event, of non-compliance at any stage, we consider that advance to Wano will, be necessary. This will be undertaken slowly with a view to allowing Wazirs to submit before arrival of troops at Wano. In the event of Wazirs not having submitted before our troops reach Wano, we would destroy their forts and villages and retire after a short halt arranging chain of such posts as may be necessary to deal with raids towards Zhob or i)era Ismail Khan. Foregoing programme offers, we think, best chance of obtaining submission and will, we hope, not be costly either in men or money.-
