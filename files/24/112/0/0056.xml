?S POC.UI.CTT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;^ GOVTONMEHT) . ?77 COT,1956,C A SI NET,TKE PERMANENT COURT OF * intl&apos;d^ATI^L JUST ICE.Memorandum by the Lord   President or the Council.(Previous Papers CP .1093 and CP, 1905.)There are three problems connectedwith tho draft scheme for the Permanent Courtof International Justice which so era to memost embarrassing, and as a matter Hillcome up before the Council at Brussels next week, I hope they will receive early cons id- ..oration.ItThe first two problems&apos; (which relate to the choice of the members of the Permanent Court of International Justice) arise out of the existing constitution of the Hague Tribunal taken in connection with the unique peculiarities of tho British Empire.    These two causes in combination would produce the paradoxical result that the British Empire     f will get too little influence In the selection of candidates for the new Court, and too much influence in tho  lection out of this l st of candidates of the persons who are. ultimately to constitute the Tribunal.     I do not know that in actual practice this would bo very important;   but the theoretical results of the first half of the plan to the Dominions, and the theoretical results of the second half of the plan to the United States, would be very displeasing; and we cannot regard either of these issues with equanimity. sThe first difficulty has arisen in this way.    The selection of candidates has
b:on loft to the existing Hague Tribunal and on this Tribunal neither the Dominions nor India have separate representation.    The British PJmpire, which for this purpose counts as a unity, has only the right to select two candidatesj and this right is vested (on be-half of the Empire) in the British Government. Hoy; can this machinery be so worked an to sat-isfy those parts of the Empire which, count as separate members of the League of Nations, but who are wholly ignored in the Hague Con-vent ion?This second difficulty seems to me at least as serious, though precisely opposite in character.     The first is due to the under-representation of the British Umpire in-the work of selection, if the League of Nations standard bo adopted.    The second arises from the over-representation of the Empire, accord-ing to American opinion, if the election is carried out on the same &quot;basis.Unfortunately the American view    or rather tho view held by the critics of the Covenant in America - has in this case some justification.    These critics have always been not by the reply that the most import-ant use of the vote possessed by members of the League was to vote things which ought not to be done, rather than to enable things . which ourdit to bo done to be carried by a majority;   and that for purposes of mere vote1 one. vote was as good as six,&apos;    There is much truth in.this contention, but it is not the whole truth.     It seems to me undeniable that
the election of Judges 1b an extremely ,import--ant function of the League? that this fun--ction la to be carried out in part by the Assembly; and that in the Asneribly the Brlt--ish Empire has six votes, and the United States online.   In the actual working of the new International Court I believe the ratter Is quite unimportant; but, as a controversial weapon in the hands of these who wish to keep America out of the League, it is, I fear, very far from negligible.   If either the Dominions or America would regard the under-representa--tion imposed on the British Empire under the first half of the scheme as balancing the over-representation of the Empire granted un--der the second, all would be well.   But that is not the way public opinion works.31*The third problem arises not out of the method by which the International Court is constituted, but out of the powers it may be called upon to exercise.   One of these powers is the right to determine any legal question in international la?&apos;.   In Sir Cecil Hurstts opinion (which I confess seems to me to be perfectly sound) this power, had it **x--isted during the Great &apos;:Var, would have given any Neutral the ri/tfit to bring the actions of our naval authorities and the decisions of our Prize Courts before the Permanent Court of International Justice.   I do not know w&quot;. ft the result would have been; but 1 cm jjardly believe that our naval authorities   ould have
regarded it with equanimity.It has, moreover, to be noticed that in the opinion of the Attorney General this problem does hot merely touch the great war of the future which, if the League of Nations succeed&apos;:,, will never take place, but has a retrospective bearing on the Great War which is Just over.   He seems to be of opinion that there is nothing to prevent Ueutrals (and I am not quite sure why he li its it to Neutrals) from claiming dnuages for any actions taken by our cruisers, and any decisions come to by our Prize Courts, and, if they do not re--ceive satisfaction, from bringing the case before the Permanent Court,     If public opin--ion in one Dominions would be outraged by the first of the three prohlems I have been discussing, while public opinion in America would be outraged by the second, the third is almost certain greatly to disquiet public opinion in this c -untry0As I understand it, the difficulties so far dealt with do not in any way depend upon Article 33, which enables one member of the League to hale another before the Perman--ent Court, irrespective of what this other may do or say.   * hardly think that this provision will stand discussion.&apos;  It Is not one in which the British Empire is more con--cerned than other people; but I think I &apos; should have instructions about it before going to Brusselse
I ought to add that embarrassing as these difficulties seem and are, it is very important that this country should not adopt an attitude at Brussels on this subject which can be represented, or misrepresented, as be--ing obstructive,(Intlld.)   A.J.B.11th,1 0.00
