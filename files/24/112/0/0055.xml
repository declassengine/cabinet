THE CABINET. PR^SOQjdiS - FOREIGN OFFICE.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.During the Recess I have been endeavouring to bring the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-and,the artist - Mr. Goetze - into some line of agreement in regard to the Frescoes painted for the Foreign Office, The position at   the mpment is that the Foreign Secretary agrees to these Frescoes being shown in place at the Foreign Office to be viewed by the Cabinet, and to remain there for a sufficiently long period to enable a considered Judgment upon their merits to be given,The difference tetween the Foreign Secretary and the artist lies in the question of how these Frescoes should be fixed to the walls.   The artist!s views are that they, should be fixed by   the &quot;Mar-ouflage&quot; process,.   He maintains firstly^ that otherwise   they cannot be properly judged, and that he will not feel that his work has received proper consideration, and secondly;- that, according to his opinion and that of the expert whom I personally have consulted there is serious risk of these very large canvasses, painted by a new and special technique never employed   before, being irrevocably damaged   by   treatment in any other way.   I- am to point out that in the original arrangement made by Lord Beauohamp (who was then First Commissioner of Works) with the artist; the artist undertook that he would be responsible for   the   oost of placing these Frescoes on the walls.   This arrangement the artist is quite prepared to carry out.The
The Foreign..Secretary,, on-&apos;tlie-otlier hand, ineists on the Frescoes being put up on stretchers, contending that serious damage might be done to the walls if the Frescoes are erected by the   riviarouflage&quot; process and then taken down, and that the stretcher process is the simpler one.intoIn.view of the narrow points/which the controversy now seems to have reduced itself, it is surely not unreasonabl to contend, in a matter of this kind, which, after all, is of the gravest importance to the artist, that it is only fair that hjg wishes should be met as far as possible.   The only conditions the artist asks for are, firstly, that the Panels should be placed as mural decorations in situ by the &quot;karouflage&quot; process   so that the Cabinet can then judge them for themselves, and secondly, if the Cabinet doubts the suitability of the Frescoes, that a Committee should be appointed consisting of the President of the Royal Academy as Chairmen and four painters nominated by the President who are experts in mural decoration*The whole position may be summarised as follows:-Mr, Goetze commissioned by a previous Government to paint these Frescoes for the mural decoration of the Foreign Office, having completed them, is requested to allow them to be adjudicated upon.   Reluctantly lie consents, but on the perfectly justifiable conditions that:-(a)   they are to   be put up at bis own expense in a manner which he, and other competent expert opinion, think the only manner in which they can be properly judged and
(b)   failing a decision by the Cabinet that the matter be referred to   the President of the Royal Academy who shall nominate a Committee of four painters, who are experts in mural decoration, with himself (the P.R.A.) as Chairman.   No expense i&amp; involved except; possibly, the expense; if they   &apos; are judged to be unsuitable for the Foreign Office, of taking , them down again,.The Foreign Secretary, on the other hand, agrees to the Frescoes being shown in position but stipulates that a method shall be employed&apos;which he contends is the simpler method, but which the artist contends will not show his work to proper advantage,    It would appear, however, to detract from the value of the opinion of Mr. Holmes whom the Foreign Secretary quotes that the Panels have not been seen by the former, whilst; on the other hand Mr * Turpin, the competent authority   I have asked to advise me, has seen the Frescoes and has the advantage of a large experience in placing mural decoration work for Mr. Brangwyn.I submit herewith the whole of the recent correspondence between the Foreign Secretary and myself, together with the opinion I have asked for of Mr, Turpin, and the opinion of Lr. Holmes, the Director of the National Gallery referred to by   the Foreign Secretary.As regards the possible damage to the walls, I have had-this matter gone into by the responsible officers of my   Department and I am informed that the maximum cost of re-decorating the wails (an expense, which in view of their present condition will have to be incurred in the near future in any event) will be  500.Without
Without wishing to be tedious I must again pointout what, in my opinion, la the position of the Cabinet inthis matter.   It cannot be denied that this work, was undertaken by the   artist directly under the commission ofthe then First Commissioner of Works, Lord Beauchamp, withthe sanction of Mr. Asquith&apos;s Cabinet.   In ordinarycircumstances the artist was quite entitled to anticipate that, when this work was executed that it would be placedin position at the Foreign Office without delay.   In viewof the opposition the Foreign Secretary has indicated to thecourse being adopted the artist is prepared, in order tomeet the wishes of the Cabinet   and myself as far as possible,to submit kis work to the possibility of refusal, which if ithad been anticipated on his part, would have certainlyprevented him devoting the enormous labour and money he hassacrificed for this gift to the Nation.   Surely the positiondifficultof the Cabinet is a sufficiently/and ungracious one in any event, and I cannot imagine that it could be good policy for the Cabinet to refuse   the artist the mere satisfaction of knowing that his work has been displayed in a manner he considers the only satisfactory one, and which would remove from his mind any   ground for grievance which he otherwise ?/ould very strongly feel if his Frescoes were not accepted. If the painful alternative of refusing the work should arise it will then, surely5 be in the interests of the Cabinet, to   be in the position of saying that they have done all that in possible to meet the artist in every way.This matter has now been in suspense a long time and my attention has been drawn to newspaper references intimating quite erroneously that I am responsible for giving the commission for this work to the artist, and that there is a personal controversy between the Foreign Secretary and myself over the matter *   As the Cabinet knows such statementsare
are quite erroneous, but their appearance and threatened continuance is very unsatisfactory and very unpleasant to me personally,   Therefore, if 1 am not to be authorised to deal with this natter in a manner which, I am advised by-a competent expert, to be the best way, I must ask the Cabinet to   take responsibility immediately and give me a definite decision in the mattere(SdJ  ALFRED MONO&quot;.15th October; 1920.
Westminster, S.Vf.l. 9th September, 1920.Dear Lord Ourson5In fu:;;*thrTref erence to the question of the Frescoes for the Foreign Office.     This matter&apos; seems to me to have reduced itself now to fairly narrow limits, namely, the best method of placing these fresooes in such a manner in tho Foreign Office that they can be adequately inspected and judged by the Cabinet or any body of experts they appoint, and that at the same time whatever decision is come to they can be removed again without any damage,Since writing to you last I have been in communication with Mr. P. Turpin who, I am informed, is the beet expert of this kind of work in London, and who has put up all Brangwyn&apos;s fresooes*     I Bend you a oopy of his report together with a further letter in whioh he deals with some questions I had put to him. You will see from these that if the fresooeB are fixed by the &quot;Marouflage&quot; process which Mr. Turpin so strongly recommends they can be both speedily put up and readily taken down again after a sufficiently long poriod to give ample opportunity for inspection.     I will also draw your attention to Mr. Turpin&apos;s remarks regarding the difficulties and risks to the works of art in question by putting them up by the only other method of whioh he apparently is aware, and which certainly would not produce the same effect from the point of view of either satisfying the artist or of showing hie work to the best advantage 0
advantageo     I have been in communication with Mr. -Goetze and it is only natural that whatever the ultimate decision may be, he is desirous, at any rate, that his work should bo judged under tho best conditionst and dealt with in such a manner as to involve the minimum risk of damage *In those circumstances I do sincerely trust that you. will withdraw your objection to having the frescoes fixed on the wall by the &quot;Marouflage&quot; process. I think I can state vrith some confidence that you need not fear* if this were done, and an adverso decision oome to, that Mr. Goetze would consider himself justified in starting a Press campaign of complaints     If you are anxious to avoid controversy of this character, which I certainly think would be unpleasant for all concerned, and Which I havo done ny best to obviate I feel sure, if you can agree to my proposition, that this result is more likely to be achieved.     You, like nv^sslf, must be most anxious to arrive at a settlement of this question, and I hope you can send mo an affirmative reply.Yours sincerely,(Sd.)

COPT.Po turpin,&apos;17t Bernere Street,We 1.3rd September, 1920Sir,As requested I have inspected tho walls of tho Grand Staircase at tho Poroign Office to find out tho best way of putting temporarily the decoration of Mr, Goetze, and beg to give you below my report.I find the walls are a very good foundation for fixing those paintings by our proceee of marouflagOo In sending a sufficient number of men I can guarantee to fix each canvas in one day; I will have to keep the preparation a little more fresh than usual, in order to bo able to take -them down within six weeks from the dav each canvas will havo boen fixed, should it be required.&apos; If the paintings are left longer the plaster of the walls may suffer, but if taken down in the specified time I cb not think that the plaster vail come off, but tho walls will only require scraping and repainting.I consider it the best way to do full justice to the artist1s work and also less danger of damage to the paintingst especially to the three largest and most important ones, than by hanging them in any other way,.I am, Sir,,Yours respectfully,(Sd.)

Po   TURPIN;17, BorneVs Street,W.    la6th September; 1920&apos;nDear Sir,I beg to confirm my verbal answer, which I gave you this morning, i.e0to quo stion hor 1.    &quot;What damage is likely to be involved in your method?&quot;I consider that in taking great care, as we always do in fixing mural decorations, there will be no risk of damage to the paintings in fixing them by our process of marouflago:to question Hq, 2o     &quot;What other methods you would suggest and how the danger of damage would compare?&apos;I do not wish to   suggest any other method of fixing these canvas? altliough they are sometimes fixed on wooden chassis, but in doing sc there is a risk of tearing the canvas with the naijla and also of damaging the paintings, ?which may crack, especially when the canvas to be dealt with are very large.     The whole of these paintings could not be transported already mounted on their chassis and there is so little room for fixing and stretching them on the chassis that I consider it would be a risky process to fix thorn in that way.     &apos; 1I remain, dear Sir, Your faithfully,(Sdo) P. TURPINoDan Thomas, Esq.,HcM. Office of Works, SJ0 1.
Grove House, Par]-. Road,Regents Park, N.W.6.13th September, 1920. Dear Sir Alfred,I have carefully considered your official letter of the 19th ultimo bearing on Sir Lionel Earle&apos;e conversation with me of August 11-5,Since then; as I understand you have received expert opinion on the question of fixing the panels at the Foreign Office in a temporary manner that would comply with the requirements of ny work.Accordingly I write to say that I agree to hand over to H.M. Government the completed decorations as commissioned by the Cabinet (May 15th 1914) on the understanding that this method; now under consideration for placing the whole scheme in situ, is oarried out, and that should there then be any question as to their suitability for the position for which they were designed, and should H.M. Government wish to be satisfied in this respect, I would be willing to abide by the judgment of a committee nominated by, and presided over by the President of the. Royal Aoademy of Arts, notwithstanding that no such reservation was indicated in the original contract.I am,, faithfully yours,(Sd.) SIGISMUND GOETZE.. Hon.Alfred Mond, Bt,, M-P.
1, Carlton House Terrace, S.W, Is,SBth September, 1920.Dear Sir Alfred Mond,Peeling doubtful whether the process of Marouflage as described in the correspondence forwarded by you might not(a) cost a considerable sum(b) involve injury to the paintings in thoevent of removal(c) entail a very great subsequentoutlay in the redecoration of the walls from which removal had been effected,I sent the correspondence to the Director of theNational Gallery of which I am a Trustee and asked himto advise,.In view of his reply, which I enclose, I am unable to agree to Mr. Goetze!s paintings being set up in the Foreign Office by that process and I adhere to my original proposal (to v/hich the objections are in the main illusory) that they should be hung on stretcherscYour&apos;s truly,(Sd.) 0URZ0N,
Copy of a lot tor from Mr, CJ,J, Holmos, Director of the National Gallery to Lord Curzon, dated 28th September, 1920.Dear Lord Curzon,Marouflage is not a cheap process, and I notice that lir. Turpin is silent both as to the co3t of fixing thesevast paintings in the first place, and secondly as to thestill greater cost of removing them? should they meet withdisapproval., and of miring good the walls to whichhis cementhas been applied,     I do not hesitate to say that thescraping and proper repainting of so large a surface may wellcost several thousand poundsn     On the other hand, ifthe pictures are erected on strotchers, for the time being and the edges covered&apos;with some suitable material (to form asort of frame for the painting, and to make a connection withthe wall surface)P the effect from the artist&apos;s point of view to would be/all intents and purposes a3 good as that of work permanently fixed, while the expense of erection and of removal, in case the pictures were not approved, would be quite small c     As the pictures in this cas,e could remain in situ for as long as might be desirable, instead of the bare six weeks which the marouflage process compels, there would also be no need to pass judgment upon them in a hurry. Kr, Turpin&apos;e statement as to damage from stretchers is not borne out by our experience hereft     The largest pictures are quite as safe from tearing and cracking when fastened to the wood by the ordinary methods^Indeed if the pictures should not be approved andthat possibility must be kept in mind, they will sufferinfinitely more by removal after marouflaging than they wouldwith even the most careless treatment on stretchers, while themoney saved by the use of stretchers might go far towardscompensating the artist for the time and labour which he musthave expended in producing the pictures.I return your enclosures herewith, and am,Yours truly,(Sd.) C,J. Holmes.
Office of Works Architect1s opinion as to the damage to the walls if the Frescoes are taken down after being fized by the &quot;Karouflage&quot; process in reference to Fr. Holmes statement.FOREIGN OFFICE FRESCOES.If the abovTe Frescoes are stuck to the walls it may be necessary, when they are removed to replaster,     In any case re-decoration will be required.     I consider that  500 should cover any cost of making good and re-decoration on their removal,, The above figure dees not, of course, include any fixing or actual removing, but merely ordinary, building and decoration work after removal.
