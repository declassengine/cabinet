Copy of letter from.Secretary. Cabinet, toSeeretary, treasury.2,   hit ehall G gardens ,S . i&apos;.&apos;. 1.36/A/2.4th October, 1920.Sir,I am directed by the Prime Minister to remind The Lords Commissioners of His majesty&apos;s Treasury that on the 10th November 1919 the Cabinet decided that the Cabinet Secretariat should be a Distributing Office for all communi-cations, whether to or from the League of Nations; that all Government Departments concerned, even in a secondary way, should receive copies of these communications; and that the Foreign Office should be deemed to be concerned either in a primary or a secondary way with all communications.   It was expressly laid down that the Distributing. Office should have no executive or advisory duties.It has been found in practice that the last named decision is unworkable and that unless tho Cabinet Secretariat in its capacity as Distributing Office undertakes executive and advisory duties a large part of the work would cease to be done.Owing to the growing volume and complexity of the work, it is no longer possible to continue the arrangement under which one of the Assistant Secretaries in this Depart-ment has taken charge of the League of   T?at Ions1 work, and after consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and I:r.Balfour, it has been agreed that the best solution of the difficulty will be to amalgamate the Depart-ment in the Foreign Office which deals with the work of the League of Nations with the Department in the Cabinet Secretariat concerned with that work.It is proposed that this arrangement should be carried out by seconding to the Cabinet Secretariat the Assistant Secretary in the Foreign Office who has hitherto been in charge of the Lenrue of Nations&apos; work in that Department.   This Officer, when seconded, will act as a liaison officer between the Foreign Office   and the Cabinet Secretariat in precisely the same manner as the Assistant Secretary seconded by the Treasury acts as liaison officer-between your Department an ; this Office, under the arrange-mentc approved in January last,I am to enquire whether Their Lordships will be prepared to give Their general sanction for the arrangements indicated above, and to add that, if They see no objection, it is proposed that the remuneration of the Assistant Secretary seconded by the Foreign Office should continue to be paid by th t Department during the time his services &quot;gre lent to the Cabinet Secretariat.1 am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd)   K.P.A.HAWKEY,Secretary, cabinet.
