TP I1.............olli v^xvJQi A .I circulate for the information of my colleagues in the Cabinet some comments on the report of the British Government delegates to the Genoa Conference (CP. 1824).The complaint is made in para. 49 that the instructions given to the Indian delegates were framed and carried out with little reference to the British delegates.These instructions were settled by me in consultation with the Government of India, but as a matter of fact one of the British delegates was informally consulted before the line to be taken in regard to the reduction of the hours of labour was decided upon. As for the manner in which the Indian delegates carried out their mandate to safeguard the position of Indian seamen, I cannot do better than append an extract from their report. This describes fully the events leading up to the final vote on the draft Convention on Honrs of Labour, and explains the reasons which led the Indian delegates to take no part in the voting. I have expressed my full approval of the action taken by them.The British delegates, I am informed, rendered little or no assistance in securing representation for India on the various Commissions set up (para. 22). By their own efforts the Indian Government delegates secured a place on the Committee of Selection, but on the six Commissions set up to deal with the various items on the agenda the Indian Government delegates only secured representation on one. Had it not been that the Canadian Government delegate, surrendered his place the Government of India would, indeed, have been without representation on the Commission on Hours of Labour, although the lascar problem was a special one, and although Indian seamen outnumbered those of any other country represented at the Conference except Great Britain.I am, however, less concerned with the want of agreement between the British and Indian delegates than with the proposal made in para. 50 that, in preparing for future Conferences, and in dealing with questions of international labour policy, the Ministry of Labour should co-ordinate the work of all Government Departments, including the India Office.My objections to this are two-fold. In the first place, any arrangement of the kind which would embrace India would in practice be found unworkable. -When an item is placed on the agenda the International Labour Office sends to each Government a questionnaire, and having collated the replies, issues a report describing the law and practice in each country, and the views of the various Governments, when views have been expressed, together with a draft Convention to be placed before the Conference. All this involves considerable delay, and in the case of a distant country like India, the instructions to delegates cannot be settled, and then only by cable, until the last moment. The intervention of the Ministry of Labour, even if it were desirable, would further complicate a procedure already sufficiently cumbrous, and it is also to be remembered that if, as may well happen, the two Government delegates are sent from India, the India Office would not necessarily know the facts nor be *aware of the instructions given to delegates unless those instructions involved legislation requiring the sanction of the Secretary of State.The second objection goes much deeper. The admission of India to membership of the League of Nations has created a new situation difficult to harmonise with the constitutional position, and this difficulty is accentuated by the recent grant to India of a substantial measure of self-government as the first stage towards responsible government.Already, in such matters as the nomination of delegates to International Conferences the question has arisen whether the Government of India should act independently, or under the control of the Secretary of State ; but I have purposely left this undetermined, preferring to proceed by mutual agreement. Sooner or later, hxxwever, the issue will have to be faced, and I have little doubt that, whatever the legal or constitutional position may be, it will be found impossible to deny to India a considerable degree of independence in exercising her rights as a member of the League. Just as India will henceforth be left free to settle her own fiscal policy, save when international interests are involved, so in domestic labour legislation it will be impossible to force her to adopt measures. against her will, and the status of India in International Labour Conferences must tend to approximate more and more to that of a Dominion a status. ,   2390     100  10.20 1 A
which the Treaty of Peace implicitly confers on her.  The idea underlying the Labour Covenant of the Peace Treaty, as I understand it, is that while each State is left free to ratify or not, as it pleases, draft Conventions that may be adopted, international public opinion will be brought to bear on an unprogressive State which, by persistently refusing to ratify, lags behind the rest of the world.   As India has become a member of the League of Nations, labour legislation in India is bound to be, influenced by this international opinion, but it would be unfair to India if she were, in addition, subject to any form of pressure from Great Britain, whose interests are in this respect not only not identical, but in some ways antagonistic.   At the moment Indian opinion is highly sensitive and suspicious, and I would deprecate any action likely to afford ground for the belief that in labour legislation the interests of India are to be subordinated to those of Great Britain or that the instructions given to Indian delegates are to pass through the alembic of the British Ministry of Labour. It may be that nothing of the kind is  intended in the proposal now made, but the treatment of the India Office as a department of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this particular matter would not unreasonably he so regarded. If, however, the Indian delegates are in London before an annual conference it is clearly desirable that-as was done before the Washington and Genoa Conferences---they should discuss matters informally with the British delegates.   Further, if before each annual Conference the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Dominions and India could exchange views with a view to ascertaining whether in any matters common- action is possible, I would cordially welcome such an arrangement.But the practical difficulties to which I have referred might render this impossible and it is uncertain how the Dominions wrould regard such a proposal.E. S. M,&apos;    30th September 1920.Extract from Report of the Delegates of the Government of India to the International Labour Conference held at Genoa, June-July 1920, to deal with questions relating to Seamen.Hours of Labour.Without any preliminary discussions in full Conference on the general principle embodied in the Draft Convention prepared by the International Labour Office, that document was remitted to a Commission of 30 members (10 Government, 10 ship-owners&apos;, and 10 seamen&apos;s delegates)&apos; for examination and report. It was, perhaps, unfortunate that this discussion did not take place, as the Commission started its work without guidance from the Conference as a whole, and without any clear indication of the views of the various Governments. On the Commission Great Britain, France, Italy, Holland, Japan, and Norway had eacifc three representatives; Sweden, Canada, India, and Denmark two each; and Germany, Spain, Greece, and. Australia one each. In the Government group India was not elected, and it was only through the good offices of the Canadian Government delegate, who surrendered his place in our favour, that the Government of India was represented on this important Commission.The Commission held 16 meetings between the 21st. June and the&quot;6th July.The history of its work is the history of the Conference itself, and it is desirable, avoiding unnecessary details, to describe in broad outline the events that led up to the final result; for although that result was inconclusive, it cannot fail to have an. important bearing on the ultimate.settlement of the hours of work of seamen.It would be almost impossible to give any connected account of. the interminable discussions that took place, of the cross currents at work, and of the vain efforts to reach a compromise.   At the outset the claim was advanced by the seamen that the Washington Conference had already decided that the principle of the eight-hour day. and the 48-hour week should be adopted in the case of maritime workers and. that the Genoa Conference was only concerned with the application of that principle.. A critical examination of the Washington documents (i.e., the report of the Hours of/ Work Commission, Article 1 of the Draft Convention and the debate in full
Conference) would seem to leave little doubt that this claim was well founded, although. Mr. Barnes in a letter to the Press had expressed the opposite view. It seems, however, no less clear that whatever may be the interpretation of the Washington Convention the majority of the delegates there who voted for the Convention did so in the belief that the whole question was left entirely open. It was not until almost the end of the Conference that the British delegates expressed any definite views on this fundamental question which coloured the discussions of the Commission, but by that time the seamen had obtained a long lead and the declara-tion that the Washington Conference had travelled outside its mandate in dealing with maritime workers lost much of its force. We took an early opportunity to point out that this particular question did not affect India, as Article 6 of the Washington Convention, which was self-contained, specified precisely the industrial undertakings to which the principle of the 60-hour week should be applied. But though India came to the Conference unfettered in this respect we declared that the Government of India had no desire to reap any advantage from this circumstance, but were willing, if the hours of work of seamen generally were reduced, to propose a reduction in the hours of work of Indian seamen so that in international competition the latter would be in no more favourable position relative to white seamen than at present. We also made it clear that the matter which concerned us most closely was to retain the Indian seaman in employment and that we cOuld agree to nothing which would have the effect of depriving him of his means of livelihood.The main discussion then proceeded on Article 1 of the draft, which declared the effective working hours to be either eight in the day or 48 in the week as provided in the succeeding Articles. The second Article, it should be noted, provided for a 56-hour week on large vessels. Much of the uncertainty that followed was due to the fact that the draft followed the French method of first stating the broad principle and then specifying the exceptions, however vital those exceptions might be, as, to the British mind, a definite statement in Article 1 that the effective hours were either eight in the day or 48 in the week bore the obvious interpretation that this was the ordinary rule to be adopted, only to be departed from in exceptional cases. In order that the position might be made clear the Chairman (Mr. Hipwood) put two questions to the meeting first, was the eight-hour day and the 48-hour week the standard to be aimed at? And, secondly, was the eight-hour day and the 48-hour week the rule to be adopted ? The first question was answered in the affirmative by a large majority; on the second question the voting was equal (15 to 15). M. Albert Thomas (the Secretary-General, who was not a member of the Commission) then intervened, in what many considered a partisan spirit, with the result that the second question was left undecided, Article 1 of the draft prepared by the Bureau being put to the vote and carried by 17 votes to 13, it being, however, understood that amendments could subsequently be moved.This was, not unreasonably, regarded by the seamen (who throughout were supported by the French, Italian and Netherlands Governments) as a substantial victoiy, but the vote was immediately followed by a formal declaration by the British Government that they were unable to agree to the immediate application of the 48-hour week to British ships. An amendment extending the Article to officers other than masters and supervising officers who do not keep a watch was next carried, and an amendment of more immediate concern to India was then moved by the Italian Government to insert the words &quot; without distinction of nationality or race.1&apos; This raised the whole question of the special treatment of Indian seamen, and we strongly resisted the amendment on the ground that the Conference was, under Article 405 of the Treaty, required to consider the conditions of special countries. Although not bound to admit any claim that might be made, it would, we pointed out, be unreason-able to pre-judge the case before knowing the modifications proposed in the case of India and the grounds on which the claim was based. The strength of the feeling against India was disclosed during this debate, and here again M. Thomas intervened against us. Although we urged that by refusing a hearing the Commission was in effect ignoring the clear provisions of the Treaty and that no Indian legislature could possibly pass legislation which would have the effect of driving out of employment Indian seamen (who had rendered such valuable services during the war), our arguments were of no avail, and the amendment was carried by 17 votes to 9. Nine seamen&apos;s, three shipowners&apos; (France, Holland and Italy) and five Government delegates (France, Germany, Holland, Japan and Italy) formed the majority, while the nine votes in our. favour comprised those of five Governments (Great Britain, India, Norway, Sweden and Spain), and four shipowners (Great Britain, Canada, Japan and2039 A 2
India). Three shipowners abstained with the object of compelling us to vote against the main Convention.At.first sight it appeared that the Indian case was by this vote irretrievably lost, but we expressed our intention of moving at a subsequent stage a special article and were not without hope that in accordance with the French method of allowing exceptions to the general rule, however precisely worded, such a proposal would not be ruled out of order.The Commission then resumed consideration of the general question, and the next important event was the rejection by 10 votes to 14 of what came to, be known as the McVey amendment. This, which had as its object the limitation in precise terms of the hours of work to eight in the day and 48 in the week, with 44 hours in port, amounted in effect to the conversion of Article 1 from a declaration of principle, according to the French method, to a rigid definition, according to the British method, of the hours of work.   We voted with the British Government against this amendment.The rejection of this amendment almost brought about a crisis. Mr. Havelock Wilson for.the; first time attended the Commission, and made a strong appeal to the shipowners for a more liberal attitude. After some discussion it was agreed that a Sub-Committee of six (&apos;two delegates for each group) should endeavour to reach an agreement, and when the Government group selected its representatives our suggestion that the Sub-Committee should also endeavour to affect a settlement of the lascar question was accepted.Previous to this we had discussed matters with the British delegates, and as they thought that a settlement might be reached if the present geographical limits of employment of lascars were continued, we had obtained from the Government of India authority to agree to this if Mr. Cameron did not object. Mr. Cameron&apos;s agreement -was obtained with some difficulty, but, as will be seen below, it became unnecessary, as matters developed, to explore further the possibility of reaching an, agreement on this basis.Mr. Kershaw, Mr. Cameron, and Mr. Mazarello met the Sub-Committee on the 29th June, when the case for the special treatment of lascars was discussed at length. We wrere shown a draft providing for a week of 48 hours for firemen, of 56 hours for deck-hands, and of 70 for stewards ; and.with the full concurrence of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Mazarello, offered, if these limits were fixed in the general Convention, to agree in the case of Indian seamen to a week of 48 hours for firemen, 60 hours for deck-hands, and 70 hours for stewards. The question of geographical limits was mentioned, but no one seemed to attach much importance to this aspect of the case, and as the seamen&apos;s delegates did not ask for any restriction the matter dropped.When the Sub-Committee presented its report it was found that they had come to a unanimous agreement on a number of points, but had failed to reach an agreement on the vital question of the effective hours of work of seamen generally. The two seamens delegates, backed by the French Government delegate, refused to give way on the 48-hour week; the two shipowners would not go below 56 hours in the case of firemen, the three watch system without limitation of time (this amounted to a 64-hour week) in the case of deck-hands, and 10 hours a clay in the case of stewards. The British Government delegate declared in favour of 48 hours for firemen, 56 for deck-hands, and 70 for stewards.We were gratified to find that the lascar question was one of the points on which the Sub-Committee had reached a unanimous conclusion, and their proposal was much more favourable than our own offer, as they recommended that a special article covering lascars should be inserted which would leave the Government, of India free to determine, in. consultation with organisations of shipowners and seamen, what reduction in hours of labour should be effected. It was evidence of the strong feeling in the Commission against lascars that this recommendation was not accepted without question, and the proposal that a special article should be inserted was only accepted by 19 votes to 10. Our position, though not absolutely safe, thus seemed reasonably secure, but at this stage we were approached by the British seamen&apos;s; delegate with the offer that if we voted for the 48-hour week our special article would not be disturbed. This we refused without hesitation, as we had consistently supported the British delegates in their opposition to that limit.We do not confuse this narrative by referring to minor amendments to the Indian article that were discussed, but next mention an important amendment moved by Mr. McVey, the British seamen&apos;s delegate. Though himself one of the Sub-Committee of six which had unanimously agreed to the special treatment of lascars, he now completely changed his ground (no doubt owing to pur refusal to vote for the 48-hour
week), and moved that the rules regarding the working hours of lascars should comply with the principle of Article 1 (i.e., the principle of the 48-hour week). As this would have destroyed the whole virtue of the article and placed lascars on practically the same footing as European seamen, we strongly resisted it, but it was only rejected by 14 votes to 12. It was thus apparent that the strong feeling against lascars still remained, and that the prospect of retaining the special article in full conference was remote.On the main question the Commission, by 17 votes to 12, decided in. favour of a 48-hour week at sea, with compensation in the form of rest or payment for extra hours worked, and by 14 votes to 12 in favour of a 45-hour week in port. The Commission, by 22 votes to 7, rejected the British proposal for a 56-hour week without compensation for deck-hands, and by 23 votes to 7 rejected the British proposals for a 70-hour week for stewards. In both cases we voted with the British Government.The Commission then reported to the Conference, and presented a draft Convention embodying the views of the majority. Its main provisions were as follows:-The preamble declared that the eight-hour day or the 48-hour week was the standard to be aimed at; Article 1 limited generally the effective working hours to eight in the day or 48 in the week; Article 2 fixed for large vessels the working hours at 48 hours at sea and at 45 in the week in port, with compensatory rest and payment for extra hours worked ; Article 4 stated that for smaller vessels hours should be fixed on similar principles in consultation with shipowners and seamen ; and Article 5 provided that a reduction in the working hours of Indian seamen should be made in consultation with organisations of shipowners and Indian seamen. An amendment to the Indian article was tabled by Mr. McVey in terms similar to that moved by him in the Commission, and we were reasonably certain that in full Conference this amendment would be carried. It would have been supported by all the seamen&apos;s delegates except Mr. Mazarello, probably by the majority of the Government delegates, while many of the shipowners&apos; delegates would have abstained in order to secure our vote against the Convention. Though assured, of the support of the British delegates, they did not command a sufficient following to ensure the rejection of the amendment, and we thought it well, therefore, to declare that, although we did not intend in any case to vote for the Convention, we would certainly vote against the Convention if the Indian article was not allowed to stand. If, however, that article stood, and Indian interests were thereby sufficiently safeguarded, we would abstain at the final vote. On this understanding the McVey amendment was with-drawn. Our special article successfully ran the gauntlet of three other amendments, and was adopted in its original form, by 39 votes to 26. One of these amendments, moved by the Italian seam en&apos;s delegate, to add the words &quot; to be in principle similar to those laid down in the above articles,&quot; received considerable support, and was only defeated by 24 votes to 20. Its rejection was secured through the intervention of Mr. McVey, the British seamen&apos;s delegate, who defended the article as it stood. As regards Articles 1 and 2, these also remained substantially the same, the British Government proposals being defeated by a large majority. The day before the final vote it was ruled that, for the purpose of calculating the two-thirds majority necessary to secure the adoption of a draft Convention, a formal abstention was equivalent to a vote against. We carefully considered our position, and decided to take no part in the voting, thus carrying out honestly our declared intention of voting neither for nor against if the Indian article was left untouched. Any other course would have placed us in a most equivocal position, and the good faith of the representatives of the Indian Government would have been open to question, with the result that the feeling against lascars, already sufficiently strong, would in the future have become intensified. As the voting was expected to be close, the British delegates were exceedingly annoyed at our decision, but in our view unreasonably so, as we had never concealed our intention of voting neither for nor against the Convention, and, having secured the insertion of a special article safeguarding Indian interests even to a greater extent than we ourselves had proposed, we did not feel justified by formal abstention in voting against the Convention. Our clear mandate from the Government of India was to secure special treatment for Indian seamen, and during the Conference we had received a telegram from the Secretary of State to do every thing-possible to counter the strong move that was being made to drive lascars off British ships.We trust that the action taken in the very difficult position in which we were placed will be approved.
gFortunately our votes did not affect the result, as the Draft Convention, having only received 48 votes out of 73 cast, failed by the fraction of a vote to secure the necessary two-thirds majority. The minority of 25 comprised 12 shipowners&apos; and 13 Government delegates (Great Britain, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Japan and Siam). The majority comprised the seamen&apos;s delegates, the French, shipowner and Governments (Germany, Argentine, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Roumania, Serbia, Sweden, Czecho-Slavokia, Uruguay and Venezuela).It is difficult to foresee the effect of this vote. Although the Draft Convention will not be transmitted by the League of Nations to Governments for ratification, the large majority in favour of the 48-hour week has strengthened enormously the seamen&apos;s claim, and is bound to affect profoundly the settlement of this question. Whether that settlement will be reached by direct action or by negotiation, no one &apos; can say, but a drastic revision of the hours of labour at sea is bound to take place, and, if so, the question of Indian seamen will arise. In dealing with that question the Government of India will now be in a very strong position, as the Draft Convention which so narrowly escaped adoption, and which will probably form the basis of a settlement, recognises the principle that Indian seamen cannot be treated on the same footing as other seamen, and that the Government of India, in consultation with shipowners and men, should be left free to determine the reductions to be made.If this forecast of the future be approximately correct, the result of the action taken by us in not voting against the Convention should be that British seamen, who otherwise would have resisted strenuously the differential treatment of lascars, cannot now adopt that attitude with any show of reason.
