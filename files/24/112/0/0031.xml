&apos;   THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.^RET. CABINET, I\1931.I1JT3IM REPORT OF COMMITTEE QH LAND SETTLEMENT OF\ ^-SERVICE MEN. MEUQRANDUK BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES, .Vrith roferbiice to the Memorandum by Sir L. v:orthin ton Evans, CP. 1915 on the Interim Report of the Committee on Land Settlement (L.S.13), I agree with Mr. Montagu&apos;s wish that &quot;the position of Councils which have already entered Into negotiations for the acquisition of land, should be safeguarded&quot; - but with certain reservations*Councils are at present considering the acquisition of about 56,000 acres, Including nearly 15,000 by the exercise of compulsory powers,     Of this area about 44,000 acres--are proposed to bo purchased for cash.    In cases where such proposed purchases have been allovred for in the quota already given, no difficulty arises, but I submit that discretion must be left to my Department to refuse approval of other purchases for cash, as otherwise a sum of about a million and a half may be taken up out of the four millions which the Report recommends shall be allotted to councils for the equipment of leased land and land purchased for annuities.L of F.6th October. 1920.
