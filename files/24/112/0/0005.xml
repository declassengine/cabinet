IfjONTOEJlTIAL. Copy 2fo,.5 A B I X-J B T.1 p ..](;or) BRAiPT SCHE!.fl$ FOR mivUlM&apos;1 COURT OffNote by the Attorney General. (Provide Papers - CP. 1859 and 1902).This seems to be a well-ccnsidered scheme, and the only observations I have to make by way of crltioism are (1) &apos;i&apos;hat no provision is made frr the election of the additional Judges and deputy-judges in the avent of the number belnfr increased in pursuance of Article ;5, or as to how many are to form a quorum In that event.   Presumably it is intended that the additional members of the Court shall be elected in the same manner as that which is laid down for the first election, and that the Court is to consist normally of the full number of judges (see Article 25) whatever that number may be.   But the draft dias net say se,(2)   For the dismissal of a member of the Court it is required that he should have ceased tr fulfil the required conditions in the unanimous epinisn of the other members.   I suggest that the opinion to that effect of the majority if the Court should b&apos;^ sufficient,   &apos;i!he members are not likely to form such an opinion without due ccuse.   Suppose, for instance, that two mev.&apos;bors wh^ supported one another proved in the opinion of the remaining members to be corrupt, it v;ould not, as the matter now stands, be possible to get rid of either af them.On the general question whether the institution of such a oourt as that proposed is in the interests of this country ( a question whi^h may perhaps ]ia thought irrelevant) there is much to be said far the view that it is not, at all events at present.England
(Initialled).   G. H.Englani has had a bemewhat unhappy experience of international arbitrations, and there are those who have no great faith in the Impartiality of foreign jurists.If the Court is established in the near future, it iB ptBSible that Holland and the Scandinavian countries will prefer claims based on *ur action during the war, and may even challenge the decisions of our Prise Courts, with the result that ve may have to pay heavy ojmpeneation.I do not know what is&quot;the position of the U.S.A. in reference to the scheme, having regard to the fact that she has n*t ratified the Covenant (see Article 32).   Perhaps the institution of the Court should be opposed by as until she comes into the shheme by ratification of. the Covenant or otherwise. 8th September. 1920,
