P 7637) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 450320tfi October 1920.(Received 12 noon.)Clear the line.1216,S. Your telegram of the 19th October, No. 2665a (Afghanistan), lias crossed mine, No. .1214 S., of same date. Latest developments in Kabul, and possi-bility that Afghans and Bolsheviks have reached final agreement for conclusion of treaty,, were, as that telegram, shows, fully-considered, in Council. They were not, however, discussed in detail in my telegram of 15th October, as there was temporary doubt as to chronological order of Bolshevik communications, and effect of events in Bokhara on position in Kabul and on relative strength of pro-Bolshevik ,and pro-British parties, which is even yet not clear, was, until day or two ago, very doubtful.
