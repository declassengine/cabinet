It is not possible to forecast to what extent unemploy-ment will prevail during the coming winter.   At present it is estimated that there are 180,000 ex-service men out of woric besides 145,000 who are classified as civilians and 115,000 women, but the returns show a tendency for the number of unemployed to increase week by week.Unfortunately there are no figures available for the general rate of unemployment in the years before the War. The only basis for a comparative estimate of present unem-ployment with unemployment in the ye^rs 1910 to 1914 is the monthly percentage of unemployed in the Traae Unions (Covering less than a million workpeople in 1910 and now covering l,7oo,OOC) of which the following are the figuresper 1Q0 of the members of the Unions.August.September.19101912 19152.0 8*8 1.69., p.43 w 34.32,31914 (July) 1320It will be realised that these Trauc Unions figures cannot be pressed beyond a certain point and in particular
do not at present give anything like sufficient weight to the number of ex-service men unemployed.The problem is, moreover, different from that arising from periodical cycles of unemployment.   A large number of the ex-service men out of work to-day have been prevented by reason of their war service from learning a trade and are therefore rendering more acute the normal competition for unskilled employment.Ex-service men are now entitled to unemployment donation of 2o/- a week without any allowance for dependents for eight weeks until 8th November next.   ThoQe who are within a year of demobilisation are entitled to donation for 26 weeks at 29/- a week followed by 13 weeks at 2o/- with allowances for dependent children in both cases.The number of men and women employed in industry to-day is between 500,000 and 1 million more than the number employed before the war.   The expansion of industry has, therefore, already taken care of a large number, and it is at least doubtful whether existing trades can be expected to absorb larger numbers in the near future.   Rather is it probable that trade will contract until prices fall, or foreign buyers are enabled to buy more owing to an appreciation of the value of their currency.prices probably will-fall; but in the process, and until manufacturers believe that bottom has been reached, reduced output and increased unemployment may result.The increased buying from abroad will depend upon &quot;the lengthy process of re-sestablishment of credit of foreign countries, and while likely to occur in the course of time it is unlikely to influence employment in the immediate future.
Hun pricetr&apos;h^ve&quot; alien and -&quot;when foreign buyers are ,Able-topayvTor their orders, no doubt trade will become active anc employment will become brisk.Ideanr4.ile the existing unemployment amongst ex-service men will not decrease, whilst a temporary depression of trade may Increase the number by throwing out of vqts some of those at present employed.rre are therefore of opinion that step;? should be taken at once to organise forma of work which may be put in operation from time to time to mitigate existing and future unemployment,2%      7/e are aware that the acceleration of Hou^e building, Road formation and repair, and other forms of public works, and the consequent creation of demand in the hands of those employed without at the same time creating immediately con-sumaole produce or goods to meet the demand, will check the fall In prices and so delay the recovery of productive enterprise,   nevertheless, the present situation, which may easily &quot;become worse, calls for immediate action if a serious state of unrest, and a probable cause of social disaster is not to be disregarded.In whatever steps are taken the greatest care must be observed to avoid attracting to temporary employment men nafr engaged in productive industry, and while the work provided should not be treated as relief work, in the sense of relief being   given instead of wages we are of opinion that it is absolutely necessary that the wages paid and the conditions of employment should not unsettle or attract those employed in other productive work or those employed in other areas,   Every inducement should
be preserved for men to retain existing employment,or to seek other and more immediately productive forms ofemployment.3,     in reviewing the possibilities open to the Governmentfor useful action, we have searched for a trade which isshort of skilled labour, in view of the immediate prospects of employment in that trade, believing that the moat usefulpermanent alleviation would be to enable young ex-service amen to learn/skilled tra-ue.   Not merely does it benefit the man taught a skilled trade. but the addition of askilled man to that tradt; probably also ensures the employ-ment of at least one additional unskilled man in that trade-- AP&amp;rt fro;:! those trades which the Ministry of Labourdesire to reserve for disabled men there are openings for skilled men In the following trades, subjeot however toagreements being come to with the Trade Unions concerned forthe admission of new men trained into the respectiveTrade unionsr*boundary Trades, Moulders and Co remakers 3000 to 3000vacancies.Hail&apos;ay wagon building   1000 vacancies, iron puddlers 1000        &quot;Building Trades (see para, 4).We understand that certain employers would be ready to accept untrained ex-service men into their works and to pay them while training them provided the Trade Unions con-cerned could be brought to consent to the arrangement.We therefore recorariend that negotiations be opened by the Ministry of Labour at once with the Trade Unions on this point,4,   - We are not in a position to make final reoommenda-tions regarding the Building Trades.
It io clear to us, hoover, that the least gbjectiona-blc for.&apos;, of state oubaidisod emplfcyraent fro;1; an enoriomic point of view is the build-in,-; of houst-.su   The arrears of house-building art? abnormal, and the social discomfort and distress due to the absence of inadequacy of house acooiu/iodation re qui rt s imv: t; di ate ac ti on *V/e believe that Jgiven the hearty concurrence of the skilled men in the building Tr.ac.es, employment could be found on building operations for at least 100,000 ex-s*:rvice men at present unemployecuvrc are desirous of carrying with us the Trade Unions concerned.   negotiations are proceeding for the introduction of ex-service men as apprentices, in order that they may be added to the ranks of skilled artisans in the Building Trades. We therefore postpone any recommendations regarding the build-ing trades until further progress has been made vdth these negotiations.5.      ve have also considered the possibilities of employment by expediting the execution of the plans prepared by the ministry of Transport for the road programme,   we have; had submitted to us by Bir Henry xaybury, Director-General of Roads, of the Ministry of Transport, a number of proposals for the construe-tion of new arterial roads for the relief of traffic in London. The Ministry of Transport would be prepared to recommend the construction of these road3 on their merits apart altogether from the question of unemployment, if the financial situation were such as to justify expenditure on work of this character. We have examined frow the point of view of providing employment the relative advantages of constructing new roads and the our** face improvement qf existing roads.   The latter would, no doubt, be preferred in the districts through which the road3 pass,   But they do not offer the same opportunity for the employment of unskilled labour, and moreover, owing to the ahortage from various causes of suitable material for road surfacing it would not be. possible to oarry out work ofthis
r9tj.is kind on a large scale during the coming winter.    The construction of new roads Is the most suitable &quot;fork for theunemployed for the reason that in the initial stages no material is required and that In no other form of public utility work Is so large a proportion of unskilled labour used. On the assumption that the work is spread over a period of six months it is estimated that the construction of a mile of new road would find employment on an average for 150 unskilled men for six months at a cost of  55,000 per mile.   The schemes which have actually been submitted to us have been limited to those districts in which there is unemployment.   Particulars are given in Appendix I to this Report.The sum of  35,000 per mile of road is fixed as the cost of the actual road formation of a 24 ft. carriage way.   For the purpose of the present emergency there will be great objections to carrying out road construction in its entirety, seeing that sewers, drains, mains and conduits of all sorts would have to be laid subsequently.   It is estimated that the average ultimate cost of a new arterial road\ 100 ft. wide, would be  74,000 per mile.    For the sum of  58,000 the newarterial roads could be graded and roughly shaped for their full width, the actual road formation being limited to 24 ft. so that ample margin would be left for the underground services without the necessity of disturbing the originalwetf^It is proposed that the work shall be completed at a later date by negotiation between the Ministry of Transport and the Local Authorities as had been the original Intention of the Ministry of Transport in respect of the national&apos;road scheme apart from the present problem of unemployment.     In the&apos; mean-time, the 24 ft. road with shaded ond Traded margins of 38 ft. on each side will be aval lade for traffic and Mil do muchto relieve the present congestion a
In view of the fact that these roads are of less value to the districts th:vo;v;n watch they pass than the improvement of purely local thorou^a^e-j; it would be right that the expense should be borne by the Ministry of Transport, as would be the case if the plans prepared by the Ministry of Transport were put in hand as part of a national road scheme, apart from the question of unemployment *     It should also be borne in mind that the Local.Authorities in London concerned in these schemes, are not financially in a position to undertake expenditure on a large scale *&apos;&apos;re recommend that the Ministry of Transport be authorised to expend  4,500,000 on the construction of arterial roads in Greater LondonuA considerable amount of preliminary work has already been done in the Ministry of Transports     Provided that time is allowed for sifting the schemes and for the preparation of the working drawings it is believed that the actual work could begin at comparatively short notice - say within two months from the appointment of the small staff of trained surveyors who will be required for completing the preliminary work.It is essential that these should be appointed forthwith if delay in the commencement of actual work is to be avoided,, &quot;&apos;e therefore recommend -The immediate temporary appointment under General - Maybury of six trained surveyors at salaries of  600 per annum.work could be started on all the roads proposed in the scheme, but none of them could be completed throughout their entire length without obtaining further statutory powers for the compulsory acquisition of land for the purpose.    nfe therefore recommend **That a Bill be introduced into Parliament conferring &apos; powers,.corresponding to those possessed by the Ministry of Health and the Local Authorities as respects, the
acquisition of land for Housing Schemes, upon any Government Department or Loc*l or Public Authority who may have schemes of work in hand or contemplation.This should be limited to those cases in which a certificate is obtained from the appropriate Government Department that th-j schemes are of public importance and that o^ing to abnormal unemployment or other adequate causes the commencement of irork upon such contemplated scheme or the expedition of the work on schemes already in hand is a matter of public urgency*(6)    r,*e recommend for the reasons set out In paragraph 2 above that the expenditure of money contributed by the Ministry of Transport should be subject to the following conditions:-(1)   That the unskilled labour employed should consist of ex-Service men recruited through the Labour Kxcha^eii according to priority of registration, that no others should be employed so Ion7 as ex-Service men are available, and that no man should be taken on unless &apos; he has been orcmployed for at least 7 days.( )   That the names of men so employed should he kept on the live registers at the Labour Exchanges and separately identified so that the;/ may be notified from time to time of suitable vacancies of a more permanent characters(3) That the Ministry of Transport or their Agents or sub-contractors shall have the right to discharge such men as are found unsuitable for the wk.
(7)       Vie regret that we are unable to agree as to the rate of roiges to be paid...The Chairman proposes a rate of wages for work on schemes in relief of unemployment fixed at 90;f of the minimum rates fixed by.the Agricultural wages Boards.:The Minister of Health, the Minister of Labour, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labourf and the parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transoort advocate a wa^e based on the district rates paid for unskilled labour on road work.     The Minister of Labour and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour are in favour of a probationary period of 3 months at 75,f of the district rate of woges:     The Itaister of Health and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport are against any probationary periods
(jflNCES.     (6)   17a have also had baforo us the proposals of the Ministryof Transport for the construction of arterial roads in theProvinces in those districto from.which representations havebeen made to the Ministry of Labour relating to the relief of unemployment.     (Soe Appendix 2.)     V/e are informed,however, by the ministry of Labour that unemployment isequally serious in several other districts which have not*yet made any appeal and that it is very probable that ifa scheme of relief work is undertaken application will bemade from all over the country particularly if unemploymentbecomes wide-spread in the course of the winter.    At thesame time it has boen pointed out to us that during thewar at the instanoe of the Ministry of Reconstructionmany of the Local Authorities prepared schemes for PublicUtility Works to be undertaken during the period ofunemployment following on demobilisation, but that for financial reasons these have been put on one side&apos;.     It isprobable that ^any Local Authorities would regard their ownschemes as of more importance than the construction of roads, and no doubt in many cases undertakings such aswaterworks and sewers are of greater interest to the localities concerned.     It is, therefore, probable thatsore of the Local Authorities will not readily contribute to the cost of building new roads instead of proceeding with their own schemes.In order to meet this difficulty we recommend thatan Executive Committee shall be set up consisting ofrepresentatives of the Treasury. I!lnistry of Labour, theMinistry of Transport, the Ministry of Health and theScottish Office with an independent Chairman whose dutyIt shall be to consider the road and other schemes for the/Provinces
Provinces submittod by the iiinistry of Transport and other Departments, and any schemes submitted from time to time by the Local Authorities;   and to determine which of these schemes the Oovernmont shall oubcidiee for the relief of unemployment within the financial limits m&amp;ntioned.     In coming to a decision they should havo regard to the following conditions:-(.1)   The number of ex-service   men who would, beemployed. (2)   The TTtility of the work; (Z)   The proportion of unskilied men who can beemployed on it; (4)   The proximity of the work to the distressed area and the provision of adequate transport facilities for the workmen.The Executive Committee when recommending a scheme should direct the Department concerned, to offer to contribute to the Local Authority concerned an amount not exceedingE.C per cent of the cost, the Local Authority to carry out the- work with the oo-operation of the Ministry of Transport.     TheExecutive Committee should also be authorised to contributeup to 50 per cent of the cost of schemes submitted by LocalAuthorities, with such safeguards and conditions as may belaid down by the Executive Committee at the time of approval.The Executive Committee when selecting a scheme whichhas little or no national value as distinguished from localvalue should be entitled to decrease the percentage of theGovernment&apos;s contribution accordingly.     Their decision inthese matters should be final,&quot;re recommend that a sum of  2,5C0,C0C sterling be placed&apos;at the disposal of the Committee as grants in aid for theabove purposes. (9)   The
(9)   The road schemes in London and the Provinces outlined&apos;in the Appendices may be expected to absorb from 17,000to 30,000 men (London 11,700 to 23,400;   Provinces 5,100to &quot;,275) the number increasing as the work progresses.Until the conclusion of the negotiations! with, thowerepresentatives of the Building Trade,/will not bj in a position to report upon the possibilities of employment in re^apwvt of Housing and are therefore unable to say l?hroher&apos;ihirther road work will be required or not.
10. &quot;e have considered whether the funds required for the pro-gramme which we recommend for road work should be provided by a direct vote or out of the Road Improvement fund.The Estimated Budget up to 31st March^ 1921 of the Road Improvement fund is as followsPunds at August 31st, 1920  8,750,000Revenue from September 1st,1920, to March 31st, 1921.Wet proceeds of existing petrol andCarriage duties to December 31st,    1,250,0001920, when the duties cease.Net proceeds of new taxes duringfirst quarter of 1921 (after deducting  300,000 to be paidto local authorities)  3,750,000Interest on investments -      150,000  5,160,000 13,900,000,Estimated Expenditure from September &quot;&quot; 1st. 19&apos;^0 to March 31st, 1921, exclusive of expenditure on unemployment schemes * 7,000,000Estimated *unds at March 31st, 1921. . 6,900,000.Th.e revenue accruing during the 6 months April 1st, 1921, to September 30th, 1921 will be some  4,000,000*The revenue of the Road ^und will always be received some months before it is disbursed.-,   In regard to 1921, the Ministry of Transport have announced that maintenance grants, which do not come into operation until 1921, will not be paid in respect of maintenance charges incurred by Local Authorities prior to 15th May, 1921.1&apos;re recognise that while there is a larr?e margin of income over and above commitments up to the 31st March, 1921, any allocation
of thin margin would interfere with or postpone the plans of the Liinistry of Transport for the classification of roads and the giving of grants in aid for their maintenance which we should regret,&apos;yet we are impressed with the evils of any &quot;avoidable additional borrowings by the Exchequer, and we recommend that the worses should be paid for out of the Road Improvement tfund in the first instance without prejudice to the consideration at a later date of any application made by the Minister of Transport for recoupment, either of the whole amount or of the difference between the cost of the work if done on commercial lines and the aotual oost of the work done under the special circ uraotances..The Parliamentary Secretary to the iiiniatry of Transport dissented from th*S recommendation. (11)   Any contributions made for public   oiks other than roads should be made out of a direct vote to be put at the disposal of the Executive Committee for the purpose ofits grants-in-aid to Local authorities.\
(12)    Various otaer expedients hove been examined by the Committee, but at the best they would not(Sgd)   L.WORTHINGTON EVANSOctober 1920.produce relief for more than a fev; thousand unemployed.(13)     ?7e ere of opinion that it would be undesirable to attempt to introduce compulsory short time in any trade.     Uhort time i3 wori-ied in various trades during periods of unemployment by agreement between employers and woricnen.It is of doubtful economic value. Although it maintains the number of persons actually employed, the daily individual effort  -is decreased and nothing is done to reduce the cost of production which in present conditions is one of the major causes checking demand and reducing    -employment.     We are, therefore, of opinion that the Government should tales no action in the matter and that any steps for the introduction of short time should be left to the initiative of the trades concerned.(14)     We have not yet had time to investigate the question of mitigating unemployemt byemigration, but it is certain that no schemeof emigration can alone meet the presentnecessities.We will report on this aspect cf the problem at a later data,
