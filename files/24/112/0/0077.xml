Reports from provinces :  (A) Bombay. Sub-Committee&apos;s report generally received with disappointment, and probably line of least resistance will be followed for the present, namely, boycott of Councils. Lead given by 24 Nationalists who opposed this measure at Special Congress, but have decided not to stand out of loyalty to resolution, has been followed by 24 others, who had little chance of election. Gandhi issued manifesto to voters to sign declaration that they do not wish to be represented till Punjab and Khilafat wrongs are righted and India gets Swaraj. Branches of Indian Home (Rule) League (addressed) with a view to concentrate on this for next two months; also labour disputes likely to be utilised and strong lead in this direction expected at All-India Trade Union Congress in Bombay at end of October. At the same time moderates organising counter propaganda. Jamnadas Dvyarka Das resigned from All-India Congress Committee owing to strong opposition to principle and policy of non-co-operation. .(B) Punjab. Khilafat agitation received, decided check owing to collapse of -Hijrat movement, but extremist agitators preaching non-co-operation and some openly declared that persons unwilling to surrender titles will be forced to do so. Sober-minded people against it, but three of Lahore leaders and all but two candidates or Amritsar withdrawn from candidature and Sikh agitators preaching non-co-operation in villages. Arrest and prosecution of Zafar All reported to have had good effect.. In regard to dissemination of seditious matter among troops reports indicate chief grievance of sepoy is insufficiency of pay. Lajpat Rai delivered address in Lahore urging boycott of Councils and appealing for vigorous and determined adoption of non-co-operation programme.(C) Bengal. Political leaders shown little activity in last fortnight and (are) -adjusting ideals to new situation created by acceptance of Congress resolution. Recent elections for Union Boards aroused considerable interest and reveal no tendency for candidates to withdrawor voters to refrain from voting. At the same time Khilafat Committee organising determined campaign in support of non-co-operation in Calcutta likely to concentrate on jute management of labour, lascarsmid. servants of Europeans. Main effort directed towards districts. Committee propose -opening branches in important Mofnssil centres and carrying on propaganda by2509  100  10.20
means of delegates aided by pressure of social and commercial ostracism. Hindu leaders afraid may lead to violence and reluctant to face this. An association formed consisting of most of. unemployed ex-detenus as members to prevent friction between non-co-operators and opponents with object of persuading latter to remain at any rate neutral. Sir Aslmtosli Chandhuri, J. N. Kay, J. Chandhuri and B. C. Chatterjee have issued appeal to public not to boycott Councils, as the Congress resolution not binding on the minority, and ask Indians to accept the new Government of India Act as a partial svvaraj, which would lead to complete swaraj. The newspaper Bengali gives useful lead against non-co-operation, and C. Mazumdar, ex-President of Congress,, has condemned movement.(D) United Provinces.-Political classes of educated Mussulmans discuss non-co-operation. Resignations so far negligible. Non-co-operators will establish in every town, and city committees to further movement and to bring pressure to bear by persuasion or threats on holders of titles and honorary offices. At the same time among moderates and especially more sensible Mohamedans signs of movement to organise themselves in opposition to bullying of extremists. Ishwar Saran has condemned movement on ground that Gandhi&apos;s appeal to masses is dangerous and likely to release forces little dreamt of. Agra riot reported in previous telegrams exaggerated by Mohamedans of Delhi who claim to have settled trouble whereas dispute settled by Collector and Delhi Mohamedans arrived after riots were over. Leader publishing articles condemning non-co-operation and encouraging possible revision of resolution at next Congress. Newspapers of various shades including Leader and Independent calling for return of Indian troops from Mesopotamia.(E) Bihar and Orissa. Postponement of Gandhis promised visit to Bihar has caused temporary political stagnation. Few proselytes can (corrupt group) accordingly, but young Khilafat agitators reported to be tired of their present leaders and complain none of them carrying out promise of renouncing titles or practice at Bar.(F) Delhi. Politicians quiet. Doctor Ansari attempted to pass non-co-operation resolution at meeting of Provincial Congress Committee, but only 8 members out of 96 attended and matter shelved. Demeanour of crowds celebrating Muharram was orderly and good tempered.(G) North-West Frontier Province. Political agitation temporarily at a discount. 75 per cent. Muhajarins returned and being settled. Local organisers Hijrat in Peshawar, have judiciously kept in background. Even so in Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, handful of mullahs persistently advocate emigration, but meet with very meagre response.(H) Central Provinces. Extremists accepting Congress decision have withdrawn candidature, while condemning boycott of Councils they consider they are bound to accept finding of majority. In north of province, news of adoption of non-co-operation resolution received without enthusiasm. Boycott of Councils and withdrawal of students from schools being regarded as inexpedient and new party likely to spring up midway between moderates and extremists calculated to weaken Congress. In Berar, Jectures given urging people not to vote at elections and to ^abstain from calling on officials.; - 4. Several prosecutions for political offences being conducted under ordinary law. Swamy Vidyanand under section 131 Indian Penal Code for attempting to seduce soldiers at Dinapore. Two maulvis under&apos;sections 124 and 153a Indian Penal Code, at Panipat, Punjab. Mr. Ishaq Ali, editor of Al Nazir at Lucknow, under sections 124a and 153b and 51.5 Indian Penal Code. Accused refusing to cross-examine, but prepared to file written statement.5. Muharram festival passed off quietly everywhere with one or two small exceptions. Labour unrest continues. Post and telegraph employees, Bombay, still on strike. Men of Bombay Gas Company went on (? lightning) strike first and still out. Lucknow paper mills employees and Calcutta tram men struck this week. Strike in Presses, Calcutta and Simla, over, and oil workers&apos; strike, Madras, settled. Serious trouble on tea gardens in Lakhiinpur district, Assam, as separately reported.6. Publication of Esher Committee Report evolved considerable criticism in Indian Press, both moderate and extremist, on ground that recommendations impose intolerable burden on Indians finances, and create doubts whether it is really intended to endow India in the near future with full self-governing powers. Portions relating to Indian Territorial Force also adversly criticised.
