1 51(1I&amp;tiGUE. Off MaTIOUo.JEtiTABIIbHlfiBNT Off A JURISDICTION ffOh ^TOLIIJO DLIUTKb__WITH REGARD TO GOIMJIHCaTIQI^ aUD TRAMSIT H\0.VI]aB5 ffQK jfj^Uj 1MMJ$EM &amp;A0K.Memorandum by the ^secretary-General.The resolution adopted by the Council of the League of Nations on 19th tiay concerning the organisation of Transit under the League of nations, submitted for the approval of the Assembly, doet not empover the League of nations to undertake all the duties concerning Communications and Transit imposed upon it by the Treaties of leace.Article 376 of the treaty of Versailles lay a dov^n that any disputes which may arise between interested lowers v.ith regard to the interpretation and application of the preceding Articles shall be settled as provided by the league of nations.Article 336 concerning waterways provides that in certain cases &quot;any riparian tvbate, or any state represented on the International Commission, if there is one, may appeal to the tribunal instituted for this purpose by the League of nations.&quot; Article 337 provides fox the adoption of the same procedure. Similar Articles are found in the other Treaties of leace.Article 386 relating to the Kiel Canal provides that &quot;in the event of violation of any of the conditions of Articles 380 tin 586, or of disputes as to the interpretation of these Articles, any interested rower can appeal to the jurisdiction instituted for the purpose by the League of nations.&quot;The League of i-lations has, therefore, to take the measures necessary for the execution of these Articles,   The League must be, as soon as possible, in a position to guarantee, in case of need, the settlement of such disputes,   should such disputes arise in the future, it would be too late to choose a definite method of solution without giving opportunity for possible criticisms on the ground that the method adopted for the solution of the dispute had been chosen with a view to obtaining a particular solution of the difference in question, rather than on general principles.   It v.ould therefore appear to be the duty of the Assembly to determine at its first Session^/hat shall be the method of solution of ^ueh disputes. The principles of the Covenant may act as a guide in the matter.Artieles III and XV of the Covenant draw a distinction between disputes submitted to arbitration and disputes vhich, not being considered by the parties to be capable of settlement, by arbitration, are submitted for the examination of the Council.Article XIII includes the class of disputes that are &quot;generally suitable for submission to arbitration,&quot; those relating to &quot;disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law. as to the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature, of the reparation to be made for any such breach.&quot;All the disputes referred to or provided for in Article 336, 337, 376 and 386 of the Treaty of Versailles, as well as in the Articles of the other Treaties, clearly present the characteristics of the disputes defined in article XIII of the Covenant, and seem, thexefoie, to call fox settlement by arbitration.    Such a method of settlement has, Moreover,
511been ex ressly provided for by certain of these .jrtioles, namely5 articles 334, 3u7 and 386 of the ireaty of Versailles. The particular form of jurisdiction is left by these Articles to be decided by the League of Nations.   It seems therefore to follow that this jurisdiction should be the Permanent Court of International Justice. v.hich has been created under the auspices of the League of nations.By the terms of the     solution on the organisation of Transit under the ^eague, these disputes would clearly be submitted in the first instance to the procedure therein provided,   should this procedure fail to settle the disputec the case vould be brought before the Permanent Court.The Permanent Court is not in a position to begin work immediately, and, until it can do so, it would be advisable, as a temporary measure, to charge a special Court of Arbitration with the duty of exeafriing any disputes of this nature which arise,   bueh a course would conform to the stipulations of Part 13 of the Treaty of Versailles.Under these conditions it is therefore suggested that the Assembly might adopt the following Resolution:-&quot;All disputes brought^Jefore the League of Hations under articles 336, 337/ and .386 of the treaty of Versailles and under analogous Articles of the other Treaties of Peace, which are not settled by the procedure provided in the lie solution relating to the organisation of Transit adopted by the Council of the League on 19th May, 1920. shall be brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice.&quot;Until the Permanent Court of International Justice is in a position to deal with such disputes, they shall be brought before a Court of Arbitration of live iJembers, appointed as followsOne Member appointed by the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs, one Member appointed by the Defendant or Defendants, two iviembers appointed, one by each of the above members, one Member appointed by the Council of the League of nations, who shall act as President of the Court.
512&apos; The only substantial point in this Memorandums the proposal with which it conduces to set up an interim organisa-tion to deal with disputes brought before the League cf Rations under various Articles of the Treaties &quot;of peace, pending the establishment of a permanent Court of Inter-n a t i o n al Ju s t i c e .The Secretary-General proposes that the temporary Court should consist of five members appointed as follows :-&quot;One member appointed by the plantiff or plaintiffs,&quot; &quot;One member appointee by the defendant cr defendants&quot; &quot;Two members appointed, ono by each of the above members&quot; &quot;One member appointed by the Council, of the League of &quot;Nations who shall act as president of the court.&quot;The bo arc of Trade a^rf e as to the necessity for the pro-vision ox such an interim tribunal, but they are of opinion that it should consist of three members, appointed, one by each of t h e p a r t i e s, an a one (wh o sh al 1 p re si. e) by th e c ou n c il of th e League.   They consider that the ti o additional members proposed to be appointed by the nominees of the parties would not add to the strength of the tribunal, while they would make it mere cumbrous and expensive.The yorei-gn office have been consulted and concur.(Iritd.).  H.L1. S.19th October, 192Q.17ote by the ^oard of Trade on the &quot;Memorandum of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, relating to the establishment of a jurisdiction for settling disputes with regard to communications and transit provided for in the Treaties of peace.
