,-1933.0 R S T.cabim3i.IUTSRIM REPORT 0? UNBMTLOYMBHID COMMITTS33.Memorandum by the, Hln^ster ^of Transport on 0.P.19Q7.I have today seem the Report, ox tJie Unam -employment Committee, (CP.1907), and observe that it is proposed that the Road Funds of this Ministry are to be drawn upon to the extent of  7,000,000 to provide work for the unemployed:  4,500,000 to be spent in and around London, and  2,500,000 throughout the country.     In addition, a staff of engineers is to be appointed for the purpose, presumably to be paid also out of the Road Jftands, as is the practice today.I append a Report on this subject from Mr, Weal, the Parliamentary Secretary to tho ministry and the represen-tative appointed by the Cabinet upon the Committee in question,     I invite tho attention of my colleagues to this Report, as the proposals of the Committee now before the Cabinet are of great moment, not only to the Department; but also to the Government and to ..Ir. F-eal and myself personally.I would ask the Cabinet to recall the curiousposition of the Roads Department of the Ministry.    Certain specified revenues were hypothecated to the Ministry.     The Ministry holds those revenues, and the Roads Department has power to invest the monies in certain stocks and to borrow on the security of those revenues.     The revenue is raised from the road users, and the bulk of the sum which is dealt with here will come solely from the Owners of mechanical tract ion using the roads, and was agreed to by them on a definite understanding.The Report was published as a IVhite Paper, and it was clearly set out that the expenditure of the  8,125,000 net -after the payment of  600,000 for the assigned revenues and  300,000 for cost of collection,-should be given as contri-butions on certain percentages to the Local authorities of
of the country under the classification scheme, which was fully discussed and accepted, both by the road users and by the jjooal Authorities themselves.Both the Parliamentary Secretary and myself, as well as Sir Henry Maybury, the Director General for Roads in the Ministry, are absolutely personally committed to contributions to tho Local Authorities on this basis, and it would be a distinct breach of the most clear understandings and pledges if this money were diverted in the manner suggested by the Committee to the construction of arterial roads, and In. Anything like tto proportion suggested of  4,500,000 to London.The estimates for next year compiled by the Committee which sat on the Taxation of Motor Vehicles provided for  1,250,000 being; spent on road improvement, and although it Is perfectly true that the funds which come to the Roads Department of the ministry from the proposed taxation will be received so :,e time before the money need be expended, the interest on those funds is without doubt part of the legitimate revenue of the Roads Department*Again, although it is true that in the first half of next year there will be considerable sums of money invested by the Roads Department, the estimates of our expenditure -which include  500,000 this year for road development purposes, and  1,350,000 for next year for road development purposes -will be expended, and the only margin which is over for , unforeseen contingencies, for increased costs, and for meet-ing any of tho factors v/hich may accrue in the meantime, is  1,776,000 - or 10$, which is a low figure to leave as a margin in engineering estimates of this character.It is true that the development and Road
Improvement Act of 1909, in Section 18, contemplates having regard, bo far es is reasonable and practicable, to the general state of unemployment.     That regard has been paid, as far as is possible.     The funds which arc hypothecated to the Roads Department are providing a vast amount of work throughout the country.     If tho contributions- which &quot;re have undertaken to rank a are stopped, road work and road maintenance throughout the country Trill largely come to an end, and  reat unemployment will be the result.     In addition tc that, with the over-increasing burden of rates, the Local Authorities will be quite unable to Maintain their road services;    there will be an outcry from these Local Authorities everywhere, end we n\x\ merely transfer the out cf work problem, from London to all over the country.     The Local Authorities are quite unable to incr^as the large sums which they are already spending m toads, and if our support is withdrawn,  consternation,  chaos and un-employmont will develop throughout the country.,In these circumstances, I cannot but confirm the dissent to the finding of the Comraitt.ee which This. !I-\&quot;1 - as he explains in his memorandum - felt obliged to record, and which, p^i-ng to the expedition with which this proposal was forced upon him, he was unable to put before the Committee in detail,(initialled)   35. G.ministry of Transport, 6th October, 1920.
BNUL03UK3 TO C, Pj, 1933.Homo ran dura by tho Fesr! lament ary Secretary,, MinistryoT Transport.tire riitism.A natter of grave importance of footing the work of this Ministry arose at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment yesterday, ,,rhich I thin-&quot; it necessary to bring to your attention.     As you are a*mre, I have submitted to the Cabinet Committee memoranda prepared by Sir Henry Maybury show-ing the possibility of work being found promptly in making new arterial and by-pass roads and the widening of existing roods, which would absorb a substantial quantity of unskilled labour in districts where unemployment is now or hereafter- becomes prevalent.It has be on made clear to the Committee from the commonco-ment that these workp- could not bo undertaken and financed out of any funds at the disposal of this Ministry.     It was explained that we had only a sum of  500,000 earmarked for work of this character in the current financial year ending 31st March next.The Committe---1 was summoned to meet yesterday morning at 10.30 to resume tho consideration of a draft interim report. This proceeded in the ordinary course until about 11.45 when the1Chairman asked the Secretary to pass round the table a draft of a proposed addition dealing ^ith finance.   A copy is enclosed here-to.   The Chairman proceeded to read the same and explained that as the Cabinet was meeting at 12 0* clock it was essential tftat he should have the assent of the Committee to the whole of the Interim Report including the addendum just mentioned, and on its being pointed out to him by me that the Interim Report could not possibly be brought before the Cabinet that morning as it had not been circulated, and in fact some, parts of it remained for furtherconsideration
consideration, the Chairman stated that he wished to be ia a position to tell the cabinet that it was agreed and he would then recommend that consent be given to the appointment of 6 additional temporary engineers whom Sir Henry Maybury had intimated would be required for urgent preliminary work.After the Chairman had read the: Report I entered an emphatic protest against it,   1 pointed out that in ray opinion it involved a definite breach of the bargain made with the motor community v/hen they assented to the Report of the Departmental Committee which recommended a change in the method of taxation and the raisin ; of a specific revenue to be used for grants in aid to Local Authorities for the improvement and maintenance of the roads.(2)   A definite breach of a parliamentary bargain, as statements had been made in the House indicating clearly that the fund to be raised from the taxation of mechanically propelled vehicles was to ben sod by the Ministry of Trane-port for the specific purpose mentioned and was not to be available in relief of the gftn.ruI revenues.(3)   A breach of faith by this Ministry with the Local Authorities who had been promised funds in aid of their expenditure upon existing roads.   I   pointed out that you would mont certainly object to this way of dealing with the funds at your disposal,, and that obviously, I had: not been able to consult you.   The Chairman, in explanation of the hurried way of deal in-; with the matter, said he had only just got the figures and he drafted the addendum himself the previous nipht.Some members of the commit test- seemed to be impressed with the fact that the draft report contemplated your applying at bome later date for recoupment of the whole
/aor aome part of tho amount by which tj.e fund had been depleted in order to deal with the urn employment question. I altogether dissented from this view aid said I did not think the Chancellor of the Exchequer would approve of the proposed plan, whereupon it wa3 stated by a representative of the Treasury that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had personally approved of the scheme put forward by the Chairman.Sir Henry Maybury supported in the fullest possible manner the statements I had made and assured the committee that you were pledged to give grants to the Local Authori-ties which would absorb practically the whole of the fund.in the course of the discussion it was pointed out that some of the works which might be undertaken would not be road works at all, and it was to meet this that the addition which . e underlined-    was made by the Chairman.you will observe that the scheme is that 4-j- millions shall be taken from this fund to defray the whole of the cost of road v/ork in London, mainly to provide work for ex-service men, and a sum of Zjf millions shall be diverted for similar purposes in the country, but in this case to be-used by way of grants in aid.   If this scheme receives Cabinet sanction it will render it impossible to carry out the undertakings of this Ministry with the Local Authorities and create a position of great embarrassment.I may add that for the financial year ending Earch 1922, it was hoped that a sum of one million might have been available out of the revenue for grants in aid of new road v/ork undertakings.   You vdll, of course, recall the negotiations you had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer as
a result of v/hich I understood that it was agreed that this sum was to be placed at the disposal of this Ministry to carry out the obligations which it was undertaking with the Authorities.(Sgd.)   ARTHUR it7ial*lat October, 192q*
Annexure to Memorandum by Mr* Ifeal. Interim Report * Draft,of proposed new Paragraph, u&apos;e have considered whether the funds required for the pro-gramme which we recommend for road work should be provided by a direct v&amp;te or out of the Road Improvement fund*&apos;i?m T^lihfiWd budget up to 31st .%rtfh, I&amp;31 of &quot;the Ka.d Improvement fund is as follows:-Funds at August Slst, 1920  8,750,000Revenue from September 1st,1920, to March 51st, 1921,Net proceeds of existing petrol endcarriage duties to December 31st;    1,250,0001920, when the duties cease.Net proceeds of new taxes duringfirst quarter of 1921 (after deducting  600,000 to be paidto local authorities) ;,.  3,750,000Interest on investments -      150,000  5,150,000 13,900,000,Estimated Expenditure from September 1st, 1920 to March 31st, 1921, exclusive of expenditure on unemployment schemes, 7,000,000Estimated, ^unds at March 31st,1931,  6,900,000,The revenue accruing during the 6 months April 1st, 1981, to September 30th, 1921 will be some  4,000,000.The revenue of the Road Fund will always be received some months before it is disbursedIn regard to 1921, the Ministry of Transport have announced that maintenance grants, which do not come into operation until 1921, will not be paid in respect of -maintenance charges incurred by Local Authorities prior to 15th May,&quot; 1921-s?e recognise that while there Is a large margin of income over and above commitments up to the 31st March, 1921, any allocation
of this margin would interfere with or postpone the plans of the MinljS^ry of Transport for the classification of roads and the giving of grants in aid for their maintenance -/hioh we should regret, yet we are impressed with the evils of any avoidable additional borrowings by the Exchequer, and we recommend that the mvke should be paid for out of the Road Improvement Fund in the first instance without prejudice to the consideration at a later date of any &quot;application made by , the Minister of Transport for recoupment, either of the whole amount or of the difference between the cost of the work if done on commercial lines and the actual cost of the-work done under the special circumstances..Any contributions made for public works other than roads should be made out of a direct vote to be put at the disposal of the^Executive Committee for the purpose of Its grants-in-aid to Local Authorities.
