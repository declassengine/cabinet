Reply from IU Krnssln to Lord Cur is on1 a128, Hew Bond Street, London, w.l, 6th October 19S0iMr.Krassin presents his compliments to the right honourable D.Lloyd George, and with reference to Lord Curzon&apos;s )y . itbach- Note of 1st October, begs to make the following statement, at therequest of the Russian Government.A Conference of the 29th June, betr/een the RussianDelegation and the Prime Minister, preceded the handing torcu-  the Delegation of the Note of the 30th June from the British tedF,0. Government.   At this Conference the Prime Minister laid down on behalf of the British Government, the conditions which were afterwards incorporated in tho Note of 30th June.   The Prime Minister, after having stated the above conditions, declared during the said Conference t&apos;*at, should the Russian Government accept the conditions put forward by the British Government, ond should an affirmative reply from the Russian Government be received at Spa by the Prime Minister not later than the 9th July, the Prime Hinister would make a declaration at Spa^to the effect that England Mould resume trade relations with f.oviet Russia irrespective of the position taken up brother Allies and particularly by Prance, in connection with this matter.    Further, the Prime Minister declared that a favourable reply from the Russian Government would create conditions equivalent to a truce and that the British Government would be ready to entor immediately into political negotiations leading to the conclusion of a general peace.THI*j ))O0U!V*M IS IRE PROPJBWS: OF HIS BRIWlHt OOTKRHlSSHTi^WTOBWTIAL CABINETCP,1938. RJBTTIPTOr OP T3ATOG RELATIONS r;ITH RUfiSIA.
The Russian Government, u.,on receipt of the Tote of the British Government of the 30th June decided to accept all the conditions stated in the above note and on the 7th July cabled its decision to the British Government.Thus the reply of the Russian Government, agreeing to the conditions put forward by the British Prime Minister, was given before the stipulated date, and the Delegation appointed by the Soviet Government for this purpose assumed that immediately upon its arrival in England, the promised resumption of trade negotiations between Russia and Great Britain would commence.Fssom the moment of the presentation of this Note of the 30th June to the moment of the receipt of the Note of the 1st October from Lord Ourzon, the British Government has not once reverted in its negotiations with the Soviet Delegation, or in its telegraphic communications with the Russian Government, to the conditions formulated by the British Government itself in the Note of the 30th June and to the consequences which were to follow the acceptance of threatened  e conditions by the Russian Government.The actual policy of the British Government towards Soviet Russia-, after the presentation of the Note of the .30th June, has been in direct contradiction to the conditions formulate&apos;&apos;! in the above British&apos; Note and accepted without any modifications by the Russian Government, for the conditions set out in that J-ote provided for mutual undertakings and entailed, from the moment of their coming into effect, obligations upon the British Government as well as upon the Ru s s 1 an G ov eminent *In spite of the mutual undertakings which the two countries had agreed to give, that they would not participate in any hostile- actions against each other   nd that they mould
not support any hostile actions directed against one of the parties, the British Government has, since the beginning of July, taken part in the nur&apos;-, energetic diplomatic campaign in support of Poland, which had attacked mid remained at war with Soviet Russia.   The British Government, while co-ordinating the diplomatic assistance to Poland, at rar with Russia, with direct military assistance given at the sane time by the ally of England, Prance, also used all its influence, and even threatened to employ armed forces, in order to s secure the use of the neutral port of Danzig for the transmission to Poland of ^ammunition and military equipment,*This -as against the decision of the High Commissioner of Danzig, who hafi prohibited the transport through the port of arms for either of the belligerents.In its diplomatic support of one of the belligerent parties, Le, Poland versus Soviet Russia, the British Government want so far as to threaten Soviet Russia with vrar, and mobilised the Baltic FleeteAlthough the British Government has taken no official part in the recognition by France of the Tsarist General ^rangel, who is carrying on a civil war against the working and peasant classes of Russia, the Russian Government neverthe less, has Information showing that General Wrangel, who had previously been abundantly .furnished with English ammunition and military equipment, has also, during these last months received direct assistance from England in the shape of ammunition and materials of war, and that General Wrangel was given an official reception on a flagship of the British Fleet in the Black Sea, while his representatives have been given facilities to purchase and send from England all kinds of military supplies, and have also been permitted to uaefinancial/
N 0 \ x 0 I-financial resources left in England by the Tsarist Government.As regards the clause dealing with repatriation, it hasto be pointed out that &amp; number of Russian subjects detainedby the British authorities in Egypt, Persia, Constantinople,Batoum and other places, a&apos;nd who desire to return to SovietyetRussia, have not/received the necessary permit from the British authorities.     It must be pointed out also that some of these prisoners, * for example, those held at Kantara in Egypt, are being treated in a manner that calls for the strongest protest.Finally, the questions relating to the resumption of trade relations between Russia and Great Britain, the raising of the blockade, the sweeping of mines, the organisations of trade agencies * points outlined in the Note of the 30th dune - have not received favourable consideration from tho British Government, and are still in the same position as they were four months ago, at the very beginning of the negotiations.In view of all these facts, the Russia Government is led to assume that the agreement resulting from the affirmative reply given by the Russian Government to the British Note of 30th June cannot be considered as being in force up to the present, in view of the fact that its fundamental conditions   , have been disregarded by the British Government.Nevertheless, the Russian Government, actuated by the firm conviction that the interests of the working masses of Russia and of Great Britain demand the immediate resumption of eoonomic and trade relations and the conclusion of complete peace between both countries, is ready to give at any momentproof/
proof of its sincere desire to arrive at a speedy agreement and to take all the necessary steps to hasten such ogrooment.The Russian Government is prepared to return without -exception all British war and civil prisoners who are still in Soviet Russia (including convicts and also those who have been taken in Siberia and temporarily detained in conneotion with the arrest of Mr, Babushkin and others by the British Government) on condition that the British Government will permit the immediate return to Soviet Russia of Mr. Babushkin and his friends, who are in $cmdon, and also of Russian citizens recently arrested in Constantinople and at Batoum, and of all other Russian citizens in Great Britain or any other territory under the protectorate or de fee to control of the British Government, who are desirous of returning, to Soviet Russia,     The Russian Government and the British Government mutually undertake to bring to the notice of the general public the fact that; commencing from a certain date, say the 15th October 1920, ail the Russians deprived of liberty or detained in the territories of Great Britain, her colonies and her protectorates, and all the Englishmen in the territory of Soviet Russia are proclaimed free and with the consent of the respective Governments, may be repatriated at specially fixed dates and through certain frontier points, The arrangement of the place and time of the exchange of the various groups and of other details has been entrusted by the Russian Government to Mr, Litvinoff.    Should the British Government agree with the above proposition it will be necessary for it to take all the requisite steps in order to secure for Mr. Litvinoff, by negotiation with the Norwegian andDanish/
Danish Governments, the right to prolong his stay in one of these countries for the purpose of reaching a final settlement of the question.The Russian Government, desirous of meeting the wishes of the Government of Great Britain, as far as possible, is prepared to render assistance in the matter of the Englishmen detained at Baku, although the settlement of this question presents great difficulties in view of the fact that this ia a matter which must be decided by the Aserbeijan Government. The Russian Government, being unable to impose any instructions... upon the Government of Aserbeijan, can only offer its friendly offices in this matter.     It has already entered into negotiations with the Government of Aserbeijan on this sub-ject, ad begs to submit the following suggestion.The Government of Baku will send to Tiflis a special delegate authorised to conduct negotiations for the release of these prisoners.     It is proposed that the British Govem-ment on its part shall also send to Tiflis a duly authorised representative of its own or shall authorise some person in Tiflis to conduct the negotiations.     The Russian Government on its part, will delegate to Tiflis a special representative, or will authorise the representative of the Russian Republic there to give every assistance in the negotiations, and the Russian Government has reasons to believe that these negotia-tions in Tiflis would lead to a speedy solution of the question of the detention of Englishmen in.Aserbeijan,.and that this solution would be one satisfactory to tho British .Government.     In answering Lord Curson&apos;s statement that the Russian Government vetoed the release of British prisoners in Baku, the Russian Government categorically assures theBritish/
jjritl&amp;h Government that it has been misinformed and misled on this matter, as the Russian Government has never vetoed the release of British prisoners in Baku.The Russian Government declares to the British Govern-ment that it is ready, as previously, to accept in full the agreement outlined in the note of the British Government of 30th June, to confirm the assurance given by it in Its Note of the 7th July, and to carry out all the clauses of the above agreement.This undertaking Is of course, given upon the understand-ing, and upon condition, that the British Government, as the other party to a mutual agreement, will carry out all its obligations under that agreement;   that the agreement will be regarded as a whole of which the clauses are inseparable and mutually dependent;   that there will be no attempt to demand that certain clauses (regarded by one party as particularly advantageous at a given moment) shall be punctually fulfilled, while the fulfilment of others is evaded or indefinitely postponed.In conclusion the Russian Government would be glad to be informed as to when the British Government would be pre-pared to renew trade negotiations.-The Rt.Hon. D. Lloyd George, 10, Downing Street, S.W.I.
Following for Monsieur Tohioherlne from Earl Curzon of Kedleston:-In their Hbte of June 30th, His Majesty&apos;a government-^Xaixlj down certain conditions on which they were prepared to resume trade relations between Great Britain and Russia.    These conditions were accepted&apos;by the Soviet Government in M. Tohlcherine&apos;s telegram of July 7th and it was-on those conditions that     , Kameneff and Krassin were admitted to this country and negotiations were resumed.    At their meeting with the Prime minister - on August 4th, they made it olea^ that tbev. were fully aware of this.by those conditions the Soviet Government under-took both for iteolf and on behalf of its delegates,(a) to refrain from hostile actions and propaganda direct or indirect against tho institutions of this country,(b) to refrain from any attempt by military action or by propaganda to encourage the peoples of Asia in any form of action hostile to British interests or the British Empire.Hote from Lord Curzon to M. Tchioherino.Telegram (en olair) to Mr, Leslie, (Reval),Foreign &quot;Office, October 1st, 1930.     1.40.p.m. Ho,2(30.
(o)   to permit all British subjects in Russia to return hone immediately. Russian subjects in Great Britain or other parts of the British Empire who desire to return to Russia being simi 1 r,r 1 y reloaced ,Thes*e conditions have been and are being flagrantly violated.     K, Kamenoff engaged in almost open propaganda and attempted to subsidise a campaign in Hngland against tho British Constitution and British institutions;   and for these reasons he could not have been permitted, to re-enter this country.The message which the Prime Minister handed toU.Kameneff when he left London and in which tho question was directly asked of the Soviet Government whether it didor did not intend to desist from propaganda, has receivedneither acknowledgment nor reply.The recent meeting at Moscow of the Third International, over which was presided/by 14* Lenin and attended&apos;by the membersof the Soviet Government, openly proclaimed that the intentioncf the Communist party and therefore of the Soviet Governmentin to use every means to overthrow existing Institutionsthroughout the world.     Still more recently a similar meeting was organised at Baku at which /&apos;. Zlnovieff took the chair.The proclamation published on this occasion laid stress onthe determination of the Communist party to assist the peoples of Asia to overthrow the British Empire.In its wireless messages to the world the Soviet Government &apos;through its- individual members and through its press has never
never ceased to preach hostility.to Great Britain and tho British IDnpire,    The Soviet Government recently convened a revolutionary conference of Asiatic poomlee at Baku avowedly aimed at British interests.    Its actions in the Caucasus, in Persia, In Central Asia, and in Afghanistan, openly directed against Groat Britain/are well known to the British Government,    Above all in spite of&apos;long continued negotiations and of a sincere and steadfast desire on tho part of the British Government to carry out the conditions with regard to tho mutual repatriation of nationals, British subjects continue to languish in Russian gaolo or are refused permission to leave the country.     The persistent violation of these conditions can no longer be permitted.    The negotiations for a trading agreement with \:.* Krassin to which His Majesty&apos;0 Government looked forward, as the first stop, not merely towards the revival of material prosperity in Eastern Europe, but towards tho restoration of -peace, have r,ached a point at which it is necessary to decide definitely whether the conditions under which alone they have been author!1&apos;or. are being? and &apos;will continue to be, fulfilled, or whether the negotiations must be abandoned on the very threshold of success.The answer to this question rests,with the SovietGovernment.     It is impossible for His Majesty&apos;0Government
Gavwnmont to carry the agrcrcmo-nt to its fin/a., stages to long as the three conditions of-&quot;the.lr note of July 1st remainmifuJJPilXoU,,   . The Soviet Govornment must carry out Its own undertaking to clociot from hostile propaganda and action in this country and in the East. Every British subject now detained in Russia, some of then in circumstances of inexcusable hardship and suffering, must be permitted to return to this country without further delay.    His Majesty1s Government cannot&apos; acquiesce in the continued violation of a solemn under-taking involving grave injury to British subjects.&apos;The negotiations for a full exchange of prisoners, whether naval, military, or civilian, between Russia and Great Britain have now been proceeding with little or no intertillssion since November of last year.    His Majesty1s Government&apos;have throughout been ready to repatriate all Russians without distinction and without except department&apos;s    It was M.Litvinoff who insisted on ex-oludlng from the exchange persons whom he declined to designate, but who were vaguely described as grave offenders, although the nature of their alleged offence has in no case been proved.For sl time, under the arrangement concludedbetween
between Mr, Litvinoff and Kr. 0&apos;Grady the work of repatriation proceeded, and by the end of June of thi3 year 124 British prisonera of war and 727 British civilians had arrived in England, and all the Russian prisoners of war actually in this country as well as in Switzerland (for the area of operation had boon extended) had been returned.     Since that date a aeries of obstacles has been placed by the Soviet authorities in the way of complete repatriation.    The majority of the members of the British Military : i*3ion, to tlie number it is believed of fifteen, who were captured-in Siberia as long ago as December and January still remain in confinement In Russian territory.    Adequate steps to make known to British subjects the fact that they wcro at liberty to leave Russia wcrs net taken by the Soviot Government.    Ilo announcement on tho subject was published locally in Russia, in spite of a positive statement by !*. Litvinoff that the widest possible publicity had boon given to tho fact by all local Soviets *    Vhen M. amonoff loft   London on September 11th there were still in Russia, apart from the Siberian Military Mission already mentioned, a consider-able number of British civilians, enquiries regarding 81 of whom had been received by no and a list of whom was handed to kMCameneff.     I have since received further enquiries.
A third and ev*n nor?;-painful case 1b that nf the British subjects, about 72 in number, who wore seized and thrown into prison by the Soviet authorities at Baku, when the Bolshevik revolution took place in that tow. They included the British consular representative at Baku and the British Conoul at Tabriz, &quot;The was paeoinft through Baku on his way homo.    Our repeated endeavours to coxn* municnte with Baku dire*et proved fruitless.    Monsieur Litvi r-off then offered to transmit a message to tho Aser-baijr;n Government and to use the good offices of the. Soviet Government *f Moscow to obtain the release Of these unfortunate and inneacnt persons, who were reported tn m as lecoiving treatment of the most cruel description.     A message was in fa*t eent, but the only response has baen a proposal to exchange tho British subjects for a number of Taiks at i&apos;-alta, who had been convioted of attempting to overthrow the Government of Turkey or of having committod atrocities against the non-Moslem population of that country.     We have am pi a evidence to show that the -Baku revolution was brought about in consultation with your Government and mainly through, the instrumentality of your troops,     The continuance of your responsibility is de-nonstrated by a telegraphic message received as recently as September 28th. from the Georgian Consul at Baku ta the effect that, though he had obtained permission from the Azerbaijan Soviet a fortnight earlier for the release of the British Naval and Military prisoners below the rank of officer, this order had been vetoed at Moscow.Meanwhile there remain in British hands in different parts
^parta of tho British Kcnoire - the Rzeafr-jR^D&amp;Ttecri^ bG^*W*p$tV^^ of Russian sub-je*ts rf whom^-^fltovttwnrthoy have or have not been guilty of cffences against the- law of the country,, we desire to be rid.     In this country th&amp;lunderderff remain H. Babushkin and his companions, five In number, wh^ hare been detained here on their repatriation from India, solely as a means of In-duclng the Soviet Government to proceed to tho fulfilment of their undertaking. (His Majesty1 a &amp;overnnent have-gone..further than nego-tiate about, individual groups or cases.    On September 6th. 1 telegraphed a proposal that we should agree upon a common date and places for the simultaneous delivery of all our respective nationals, wherever they might bo detained.     I have received no reply to this message .This condition   cf affairs cannot be permitted to con-tinue.     The negotiations for the mutual release of prisoners cannot any longer be suspended or retarded by artificial and heartless delays.      Still more is it impossible for His fta&amp;estyl-a Government to append their signature to a trade agreement with a Government that thus treata not only its own undertakings but tho subjects of a country with which its representatives are at the time engaged in friendly negotiations.We have given an undertaking to which we have scrupu-lously adhered that we shall not assist in any hostile action against the Soviet Government, but, unless by October 10th. we have definite evidence that the conditions laid down as to the release of British prisoners are being eonplied with, we shall take whatever action we consider netesaary to seoure their reloase.Z Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.
