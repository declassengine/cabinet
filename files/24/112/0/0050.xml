Secretary, Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens,October 11th, 1920,
1. Signer Tittoni invites the Council of tho League to plaoeon the Agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly the question of giving effect to the provision of Artiole  3 (e) of the Covenant which prescribes certain aotion with a view to the equitable treat-men t of the commerce of States metabers of the League.    In doing so he endeavours to commit the Council to expressing a definite opinion in advance, to the effeot that the above proviaion is violated by &quot;monopolies in raw materials essential to the life of all nations&quot;, and by &quot;the exploitation of nations by great international Capitalist trusts&quot;.2. It is not of course known why the Italian representativethinks it dosirable and opportune to initiate a debate at the first and most critical meeting of the Assembly on two subjeots most like-ly to raise heated coi ii/oversy and to lead to dissensions within the League.     But a guess may be hazarded that Signer Tittoni&apos;s object is to raise a diecursion on the present Coal export policy of the United Kingdom - of which the Italians have frequently complained -and to give satisfaction to Italian carbour and Socialist opinion.7/whatever be the object it would be most unfortunate if the Assemby were to be involved in any suoh intrioate and delicate dis-eussions, for whioh it 16 diffioult to imagine any Body less suited.3. As however the provisions of Article 83(e) of the Covenantare invoked by Signor Tittoni to justify the discussion which he proposes, it is necessary to examine how far the Article in question gives legitimate support to the proposal.4. The wording of the relevant part of the Artiole is asfollows&quot;Subject to and in accordance with the provisions ofinternational/flot* for Mr, Balfpur on Signor Tittoni&apos;s ^Resolution entitled &quot;Tho League and International Trusts&quot;.
international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon305        XX        XK HE XXthe Members of the, League(e)    will make provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit and equitable treatment for the oemmerce of all members of the League.   In this connection the speoial necessities of the regions devastated during the war of 1914 - 1918 shall be borne in mind&quot;.It will be seen that tho obligation intended by the Article is tt conclude International Conventions (so far as tho ground is not already covered by existing Conventions) providing for (l) free communications and transit, and   (2) equitable treatment for the commerce of all members of the League.5. The history of the Article is briefly as followsPresident Wilsonrs &quot;third point&quot; provided for the establishmentof equality of trado conditions and the removal of economicbarriers.    In the earlior stages of the Peace Conference hopeswore entertained by some at least of the Delegations that generalCovenants dealing specifically with those two matters might be framed during the Conference and embodied (liko the League ofNations and Labour Covenants) in the Peace Treaties themselves.Ultimately this was found impraoticable owing to   (a) the divergencyof interests among the Allies on important points   (b) the short time available, and the urgent need of completing the Economicand Communications Sections of the Treaties so far as related to the obligations to be imposed on the Enemy Countries before taking up tho more thorny questions of the mutual obligations to be undertaken by the Allies inter 8Q*,   (q) the volte faooof the American Delegation whioh gradually discovered that  heacceptance of such Conventions as part of the Treaties of Peacewould involve the United States in inconvenient obligations whichhad not boon foreseen when the &quot;Fourteen points&quot; were drafted.Eventually the course adopted&apos; by general consent was to impose   .on all States members of the League of Nations tho obligations of tho Article   quotod above, or in other words to affirm the ,ygeneral/
general principle of such Conventions, and to postpone their actual -jMHnytlsAJUo^^ ,should obtain.6. As regards the first group of subjects, i.e. free ocmiin-1 oat ions and transit, action is already being taken by the League in compliance with the Article,    Four draft Conventions have been prepared for consideration by a special Committee which in fact consisted mainly of tho same individuals who forced tho Ports, Waterways and Railway: Commission of tho Peace Conference, with a few neutral representatives added.     The Assembly of the League will be invited at its next meeting to constitute a special Conferen for the consideration of thee drafts,7, Mo corresponding action has yet been taken with regardto &quot;eouitable treatment of Commerce&quot;, but there have been very sound reasons for the delay, and on all groundn it is highly desir-able to carry the Transit and Communications negotiation to a further stage before embarking on the far more delicate and con-controversial task of attempting to frame an International Commercial Treaty.The Transit arid Communications Conventions raise few points of hish molicy or acute controversy.     The Questions dealt with by them, though very Important, are rather technical than political, and the main principles on which the? are founded are, for the most part, -in conformity with the existing practice of the more enlightened nations ,     Moreover these questions are not only&apos; ripe for treatment, but urgently require immediate action owing to the transit difficulties arising out of the re-casting.of the map of tho  &apos;orld under the ..&apos;eace Treatie .The experience gained im preparing and completing this group of Conventions will be invaluable when the far more difficult task of. negotiating Commercial Conventions is eventually undertaken.It is clear however that prooont conditions are extremely.unpropitious
unpr-npitioun for the immediate n tar ting rAfW-^i^r^u^ ^rKn^^he^tortevi^rm^ The Kcono^^state of the world is still entirely abnormal, and until much more Substantial progress has been made towards the restoration of normal peace conditions it will be very clifficult to obtain an atmosphere in which normanent economic relations can be properly considered in their right perspective, apart from the distorting effect of the urgent and special problems of the transition period, Even in Article 23 of the Covenant a special reservation for the devastated Countries had to be accepted, and any general code for regulating general commercial relations would, as things stand, be certain to be plastered over with reservations and exceptions of all kinds to meet the present abnormal conditions, which would go far to nullify its value,8. It- is therefore the view of the Board of Trade that itis desirable if possible to delay any steps under Article S3 (e) towards framing an International Convention dealing with Commercial relations, until at&apos; least another year has elapsed.     The Board of Trade are also of opinion that when the moment arrives when the matter can be profitably taken up, the action taken should certainly not be initiated by a debate in the Assembly of tho League on the merits of particular economic questions of a controversial character, Buch as would result from the adoption of Signer .Tittoni&apos;s resolution.     Nor would the reference of the question to a Committee of experts constituted ad hoc (the procedure which was adopted with considerable advantage in the much simpler case of the Transit and Communications Conventions) be of any practical service in the present cose, since the main difficulties to be overcome &quot;are not. technical but political, and can only be profitably discussed by the responsible ministers of the various States meeting in conference.9 For this reason the Board of Trade take the view that&apos;thevfirst step towards the desired object which can usefully be taken is the constitution under the auspices of the League of Nations
of a standing Conference of the; Ministers of the various StatesA &apos;vior,ibors of tho League who aro\ reopon3iblo for Commerce and Indus-try, with power to send a duly authorised representative in case of unavoidable absence,    This Conference would of course be a more efficient organ for the purpose if It were possible to con^s fine membership to the Ministers of the Principal States, but if,1 an is possible, this is impracticable,&apos; tho same object can be attained by the constitution of a small Sub-Committee of the Conference to prepare drafts for consideration by the main body,10.     The Board of Trade are further of opinion that the Con-forence here su^cstod would be the most useful form of orimnisa-tion which the League of &quot;Nations could set up to consider in the first place tho other economic problems with which the League lias to deal, eeg* the eventual revision of some of the Economic terms of tho Peact Treaties contemplated under Article (280) of the German Treaty, the annual reports of the various Mandatoriei on economic matters within i. undated territories, the mode of giving effect to the economic obligations of the various States under Article (16) of the Covenant (Economic blockade of offending powers) fcc.,&amp;c.11.    The Doard of Trade would therefore favour immediate action with a view to tho establishment of such a Conference, with periodic (but not too frequent) meetings, and they would support any proposal for this purpose that may be submitted to the next meeting of the Assembly, provided that the resolution setting up tho Conference is in entirely general terms, and does not refer explicitly to any of tho matters specified in Slgnor Tittoni r-s proposal.     It--,could then be safely left to the Conference itself to initiate for the consideration of the Supreme Authority of the League such proposals for international action as the responsible ministers/
ninistors of whom tho Conference vrould he composed consider practicable and timely.12. Ton sum up; our view as regards procedure is that(a) Signer Tittonilc proposal to take immediate action under that part of tho Article 23 (c) of the Covenant which refers tc the equitable treatment of theCor merec of -embers of the League is premature owing to the unsettled and abnormal economic conditions still pre vai 1 ing *(b) It would serve no useful purpose, and would be extremely undesirable to make the Assembly of the League, ospecially at its first meeting, the scene of a debate on controversial Economic question-. tions*(c)It is desirable to move the Assembly of the League to constitute a standing Conference of the Ministers charged with Trade and Industry (with power in case of unavoidable absence to send a duly authorised representative) to meet from time to time and to advise tho League as to the best means of discharging the various economic duties which are imposed on the League of Nations under the Peace settlement.(d) If such a Conference is constituted the ICoard of Tr^do consider that tho British representative should take the line that the- time is not yet ripe for attempting to negotiate an International Commercial Convention.(e)lt would naturally be competent for the Italian ro-prooontativc on the Conference to put forward pro-posals   for tho regulation or prohibition of injury-ious monopolies or international trusts, and of as is suggested above the Conference consists solely of the competent ranistors in the various States
advised by their own expert officers any such proposals would be properly explored with a full sense of responsibility, (f) The Beard oi Trade would be strongly opposed to the establishment by the League of Nations of any Committee or organisation other than that suggested above to deal with International Economic questions. 13.      Turning from the question of procedure to the substance of the questions raised by Signer Tittoni it should not be for-gotten that in the most favourable circumstances it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to draft an International Commercial Agreement to which (say) the United Kingdom, Prance and the United. Slates, with their widely differing commercial policies wOuld all be prepared to subscribe - (to say nothing of,British Dominions such as Australia), and which would still possess some element of value.   Yet an agreement which left out any one of these three Countries would practically be of little utility.   To attempt such a negotiation at c moment when the United States is not even a member of the League, and France is entirely pre-occupied by the difficulties of her recovery from the effects of the war would be to court failure.   At the ^aris Conference, the British Empire Delegation after prolonged discussions were not able to agree unanimously among, themselves on the terms of a Convention to establish equal trade conditions.   A copy of the draft prepared by the Economic Section is attached for reference, (marked A), but it was never submitted to the Allies.   Probably, the chances of general approval ofsuch a draft now are less than they were at Paris.14.      Finally, it may be observed that this draft, even if generally adopted;  would not have met either of Signor Tittonl&apos;s special points, and, indeed it seems a straining, of the languore of the Covenant to regard such matters as the regulation of monopolies and trusts as covered by so general an expression, as the equitable treatment of the commerce Of foreign States, unless of course the State Itself administers or grants special
powers to such monopolies and trusts and thus becomes res-ponsible for their actions.15.      The regulation of International Combinations may become a matter which requires the attention of the league of Nations, but it will be a matter of extreme difficulty and complexity and it is futile to discuss it until the various Countries have tsken the preliminary steps to deal with their own domestic trusts.   So far as the United Kingdom is concerned a Bill for this purpose has recently been drafted, and Is attached (marked B),   It has not however been introduced into the House of Commons, and is therefore, a confidential draft. The proper course is manifestly for each country to deal with its own Trust problem, so far as is possible within its own powers, alter wnich, If experience shews that there- is a field still uncovered which can only be covered by international action^ the necessary negotiations can be initiated under the auspices of the League of Nations.   But there should be no mistake as to the difficulty of international action and the small prospect of success without a degree of interference with private enterprise, which most progressive Commercial Countries, would find intolerable.16.      The other question mentioned by Signor Tittoni viz:-the existence of monopolies of essential materials is of course closely connected with that of trusts and combinations.   It raises however also the question of restriction of export by export prohibitions or duties contrived so as to retain &quot;-hat other Countries may regard as an undue proportion of output for the needs of the country of production.   It is under this head, that the present Coal policy of the United Kingdom may be attached.   As regards the whole question of a policy of con-servation of resources by means of duties or other restrictions on Export, we cannot fail to understand, and to a considerable extent to sympathise with, the anxiety with which States less fortunately placed than the British Empire with regard to-e-
^ di 1essential materials look upon every step which has to them the appearance of an attempt to reserve Imperial resources for British use, and to make a^oess to these resources by other Oountries more difficult.   The whole subject is a thorny one and needs further careful exploration from the point of view of imperial Policy, before we could profitably discuss it &apos; with Foreign States.-    at
