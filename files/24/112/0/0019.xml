1CONFIDENTIALdog mi&apos;:ent is thePROPERTY OF HIS BRITANJIC MAtfE3TY?S GOVERNMENT.WASHINGTON CONVENTION ON THE EMPLOYMENT OPBEFORE ADD AFTER CKILDB5MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER   0F   HEALTH.(1) Under Article 405 of the Treaty of Peace It is necessary for the Government to bring the draft Convention of the International ^Labour Conference at Washington, concerning the employment of women before and after childbirth, before Parliament not later than the 29th November next.(2)   The principal proposals of the Draft Convention are that a women employed in a commercial or industrial undertaking shall be allowed on medical certificate to remain absent from work for the six weeks preceding and shall be compelled to remain absent during the six weeks following confinement, and that while so absent she shall be paid, either out of public funds or by means of a system of insurance, benefits sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of herself and her child, and shall receive free attendance by a doctor or certified midwife.     In addition nursing mothers are to be allowed half an hour twice a day during their working hours to nurse their babies,(3)   The financial implications of this scheme are obviously important and I have had them explored by the Government Actuary. A copy of his report is appended to this memorandum.    Broadly speaking, the women included under the Convention are the same as those already provided for under the British National Health Insurance Scheme, with the troublesome exception that the Convention would ex-elude about 30,000 domestic servants in private establishments and agricultural workers who are included in the National Health Insurance scheme and would include certain classes such as teachers and non-manual workers earning over  250 per annum (in number about 15,000)who/
rfto are excepted from Insurance.    It will be ssen that the annual Ijost of working the scheme Is estimated at  1,700,000 on the assumptions(i) that no claim Is made for extension of thebenefits to all women who would not be entitled to them under the Washington Convention, (ii) that they could he confined to &quot;employed women&quot;(as defined in the Convention)of whom only about 120,000 or one ninth of the total number of women in the Industrial classes bearing children each year would receive benefits, (iii) that the benefits were fixed at no more than 20s, a week with the addition of say  2 for medical expenses, making a total cost of  14. If the benefits were limited to &quot;employed women&quot; it would be Impossible to place any part of the cost of the scheme, which would be something like 4d, a week, on all the men and women at present insured, since only one-tenth of the wives of insurod men are themselves employed and insured,    Equally it would be impossible to impose a general increase of contribution on all insured women, about six-sevenths of whom are not married and the great majority of them with little probability of continuing In employment after marriage.    If, however, the whole co3t of the benefits were recovered from married women of childbearing ages, It would be necessary to incro^co their oonox ibutiona from 9d. to about 2s,If, however, the grant of the increased benefits to the insured classes under the Convention gave rise to a claim from the 4,0cj5.,000 women of the industrial classes who would not be entitled to benefit under the Convention the total cost would be over  15,000,000 a year. To meet any part of this expenditure by any form of insurance scheme lYould be irreconcilable with the existing present insurance scheme, and, as regards insured persons, would be open to the same objection as hasalready/
ill,already been urged against any increase of their contribution, ,(4) I have further taken the advice of my medical staff on the value of the scheme in the Convention from the health point of view, I am advised that though infant mortality rate is very high during the first month of life, this is probably due to a variety of causes towards the removal of which an improved maternity service is the chief requirement.    Under modern social conditions it is not usual for women to be driven by force of circumstances to1 return to work within six weeks of confinement although ordinarily a period of one monthfs rest would restore them to usual health,    With regard also to the suggested six weeks absence before confinement, most women already for various reasons&apos;prefer and are able to stay at home for six or eight weeks at this time.    As to the period of nursing it is held that two hours at the beginning and end of the day would, on all accounts be preferable in view of the comparatively short hours now worked. It appears therefore that there is no strong case on medical grounds for the adoption of the Convention,. (5) There is the further consideration to be borne in mind that this country has already in force a policy aiming at the same results as the Convention.    My colleagues are probably aware generally of the maternity benefit and sickness benefit to women incapable c.f work during pregnancy and after confinement provided for by the National Health Insurance Acts.     I am advised that in this sphere Great Britain is already in advance of any other country except Australia and possibly New Zealand,    There is also in existence/system, assisted by the State and available to all who need it, of Maternity and Child Welfare Centres, Day Nurseries, Maternity Homes and Hospitals, and Mjdwifery Service, together with provision of food and more particularly milk &apos;*on terms for necessitious mothers and children under five years of age.
INISTRY OF HEALTH.I      (6)   Tho adoption of the specific proposals made in the Convention would lead to serious administrative difficulties in the way of adjustments with the present arrangements and strong objection&apos;could be made on the ground that the government would be conferring further benefits on a class for which provision already exists.    Accordingly, while I cannot but sympathise with the motives crimeting the Washington Conference in framing the Convention, I am of the opinion that the best course will be for the Government to decline to adhere to it, under the option provided by Article 405 of the Peace Treaty, basing its decision on the ground of the provision already made and on the view that the true line of advance Is systematic expansion and development of that provision as experience dictates and finance admits,C, ADDISON.4.10.20
mDraft Convention concerning the Employment of Women before and after childbirth.Memorandum Jdv^ the^ Government Ac tuary.So opo 2f^Jj^&apos;-.I.r-9iS * 1,     The Draft Convention provides that no woman (whether married or single) shall be permitted to work during the six weeks following her confinement in any industrial or commercial undertaking as defined in Article 1, and further -that if she is employed therein, she shall have the right to leave her work upon production of a medical certificate stating that her confinement will probably take place within six weeks.While a woman is absent from her work in thecircumstances named above she is to be paid benefits sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of herself and her childand is in addition to receive free attendance by a doctor orcertified midwife.       The amount of the benefit is to bedetermined by the competent authority in each country and thecost of the scheme is to be defrayed out of public funds unless otherwise provided under a system of insurance.2%    Broadly speaking the classes who would be entitledto benefits under the Convention are the same as those who come within the scope of the National Health Insurance Scheme withthe exception of domestic servants in private establishments and agricultural workersx.   In addition to these classes others __^__who_x It is not clear from the Convention whether outworkers come within the definition of employment; the administration of benefits in their case would be practically impossible.      Further the moaning of the limiting words &quot;other than an undertaking in which only members of the same family are employed &quot;tire difficult to understand. Presumably the intention Tfas that in small businesses members of the family should be excluded but the position is not clear where in such a case there are other employees in addition to members of the employer *s family.
illwho are excepted from Health Insurance-would &quot;be included, e*g,teachers, non-manual workers earning over  250 per annum., etc-..As regards married women I estimate that the number of women of childbearing age who would be brought within the scope ofthe scheme would be approximately as shown below; forcomparison figures are given Indicating the number of women,belonging to thtf industrial classes who would be excluded.(l) Married women entitled to benefits under Convention.Employed Y&apos;omen&apos;( insured persons) 450,000Employed Women (excepted frominsurance) 15,000Total      465,000(2) Married women (belonging to industrial classes) not entitled to benefits.(a) !&quot;) age -earnersDomestic servants, etc (insuredpersons).    30,000(b) Not wage-earners1Wives of insured men 3,540,000Others 480,000Total        4,050,000Prom the foregoing statement it is seen that of the industrial classes about one-ninth only of the married women would be within the scheme.    As regards single women about one-half of the unmarried mothers are domestic servants and would be excluded from the benefits of the scheme.3.   The average number of births in a year in the United Kingdom under normal conditions, is about 1,100,000 of which about 950,000 are in the industrial classes.      The number of births among industrially employed women (as defined in Article 3 of the Convention), taking married and single women together, is probably no more than 120,000 or about one-ninth of the total number of births.
4. Convention lays down that In addition to theprovision of free medical attendance a women is to be paid benefits for the maintenance of herself and her child for a specified period, and the title to benefits is governed solely by the employment of the mother and is independent of the position of the father and his ability to meet the expenses of the confinement or to maintain his wife and child; In effect the mother and child are looked upon as forming a separate economic unit whether or not the mother is a married woman.Prom this it would appear open to question whether in practice the benefits could be limited to employed women, and it seems not unreasonable to assume that following the adoption of the Convention there would spring up an immediate and an insistent demand for the extension of the benefits - or at any rate a part of them - to mothers of every social class irrespective of any question of employment.      Such a demand would be peculiarly difficult to resist.     The home-keeping mother would be alleged and with good reason to be equally deserving of the assistance of the State with the woman who had continued in industrial employment.    Her claim to the bounty of the State would certainly be urged as greater than that of the mother of an illegitimate child.5.     It is proposed that in every case where the grant becomes due benefit shall be paid for six weeks following confinement, and tot it,shall be open to the woman to give up employment at any time within six weeks of the expected date and commence to draw benefit forthwith.      Having in mind that the benefit is to be sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of parent and child it is clear that benefit would be claimed in nearly every case and for the full period.     This implies, of course, 12 weeks benefit in each case.Under/*m     3
Under the Convention a uniform rate of benefit Is not laid down but the amount is to be determined separately In each country.    Opinions no doubt differ widely as to theappropriate sum which would represent the cost of full maintenance at the present time in this country.      Assuming, however, that the benefit were fixed at no more than 20s. a week, the costftr oach woman would amount to  14 including (say)  2 for medical expenses.Test of Employment.6.    *he Draft Convention provides that a woman shall be paid benefit &quot;while she is absent from her work&quot; during specified periods.      ^he difficulty of determining whether a woman is &quot;Employed&quot; or not has apparently been overlooked by the framers of the Convention.     It goes nevertheless to the root of the matter.     The title to benefit would have to be linked up In some way to the test of &quot;normal occupation&quot;.     The choice of a test which is equitable and at the same time easy to work has in similar circumstances in the past proved an insuperable difficulty.7.   On this question the history of National Health Insurance is most instructive;     the original provisions of the Act of 1911 broke down in practice very largely owing to the impossibility of deciding whether a woman who had left work on the birth of her child had ceased to be industrially employed or was merely away from work for the time being.   *n the latter event certain benefits became payable; and declarations that the woman had only left work for the period of her confinement were very numerous.   When these declarations were put to the test of subsequent events it was found that in great numbers of cases the woman had never returned to work. It was a fair inference that she never Intended to do so.   &apos;^he question was fully examined by the Departmental Committee on Approved Societies Finance and Administration and their findings will befound/
found In paragraphs 128 to 137 of their Further Report(Cd. 8396),   The difficulties of ascertaining &quot;intention&quot;In the case of National Health   Insurance wore found to he so great that the benefits for women who left work on or aftermarriage had in consequence, to be complotely recast, andall reference to this subject avoided.   The difficulty which was encountered in the administration of HealthInsuranco, where the amount of money involved was relatively small, would be magnified in the case of a scheme providingbenefits amounting to several pounds.   In practice it wouldmean that in many cases women would be drawing payments on condition that they refrained from working though in factthey had no intention to go back to work in any event,that Is to say they would receive bonefit merely becausexthey had previously been employed.8,    I reach the conclusion, therefore, that a test based on the woman1s &quot;intention&quot; would be quite impracticable, I know of no means of avoiding this difficulty, and of protecting the Exchequer from the payment of benefits to women who had definitely left work.   The possession of a stamped Insurance card would be no criterion, for there are no means by which &quot;self-stamping&quot; can be prevented.   If effective means of protection could be devised, the cost of benefits payable to employed women only would be aboutx An illustration of the point here discussed may be taken from the Report mentioned above (par, 132)*   In a case there quoted there being a certain advantage under the Act to women who only left work temporarilyf   627 women of a number who had left work on marriage declared their intention to resume work.   But in fact 425 of them never did so;   and of these no less than 404 drew the benefit which was only available for women who had retained their status of &quot;employe d contr ibut ors,&quot;
 1,700,000 a year subject to two very Important conditions -(l)   That the new benefit did not result in a large Increase of illegitimate births.   A State subsidy of Illegitimacy to the extent of several pounds would probably be followed by disconcerting results in this direction, (ii) That the benefit did not draw into the labour market a large number of married women who, otherwise, would never have sougat industrial employment.   If this should happen .the cost above suggested might easily be doubled.   Other untoward consequences would also follow.Competition for work would increase unemployment, promote oasualisation and in the long run, lower wages.If the benefits were universal at  14 for each birth the cost would be over  15,000,000 a year.
Relation   of the Proposals to National Health Insurance.9.     As explained above the majority of the women included in the proposals would be insured persons, but there would be certain classes within the scheme but outside National Health Insurance, and on the other hand some classes of insured women (eg. domestic servants) would bo excluded from tho scheme.Under the Act of 1920 an employed married wom^n is entitled to a payment on confinement of  4- and to a sickness benefit of 12/- a week during any period during which she is certified as incapable of work - whether directly or indirectly due to her pregnancy - save during the 4 weeks immediately following the date of confinement.   She may draw sickness benefit before confinement for incapacity due solely to her pregnancy or she may draw it after the 4 weeks fol3owing confinement for so long as her incapacity continues.   It snould be noted that under the statutory provisions relating to the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund societies are recouped, out   of State Funds, their expenditure on sickness benefit to pregnant women. (From investigations made in 1914 and. 3915 it was found that the aver ago amount of sickness claimed during the last 7fe months of pregnancy amounted to no more than lyj to if weeks, 70 per cent of the. women making no claim at all, and the remainder being paid benefit for fairly long periods.)10.     In the event of the Convention being ratified the question of overlapping benefits would have to be dealt with even if for no other purpose than to avoid an enormous increase in the claim for sicklies   benefit and it would be necessary to secure that no sickness benefit was payable tthen benefits were payable under the scheme.   On this poin;. new administrative
difficulties would arise;   Societies would constantly have to keep the point in view and it is difficult to see how they could protect themselves against irregular claims for sickness benefit without subjecting a groat proportion of their women claimants to a particularly odious type of enquiry and scrutiny.11.    A further point would arise as to whether maternity benefit should be continued in the case of women who were deceiving the benefits of the now scheme *   This involves large issues.   If the scheme could be limited to employed women the  2 maternity benefit provided by the women1s own insurance could be discontinued but the  2 provided by her husband^ insurance would have to continue.   Obviously the benefits provided under a manls insurance could not be varied according to whether his wifo was or was not employed at the time the benefit became due. Such a provision was in fact in the original Bill of 1911 but disappearod under the scrutiny of the House of Commons.If on the other hand tile benefit were universal all maternity benefits Gould bo removed from the Health Insurance Scheme, and the State contribution to that scheme modified accordingly.   This would be the reasonable course, but for what it may be worth the fact must be recognised that it would arouso the strong opposition of the Approved Societies.Methods of providing for Cost of Scheme. 12.    The Convention lays down that the benefits are to bo provided either out of public funds or by means of a system of insurance.   I have accordingly considered the question whether it would bo practicable to provide for the benefits of the scheme by an addition to the contributions payable under the National Health Insurance Acts.   If the benefit were limited to employed women it would not be possible to place any part of the cost of tho scheme on men since only one-tenth of the wives of insured men are themselves employed and insured.   Equally it would be impossible to impose a general increase of contribution
on all insured women about six-sevenths of whom arc unmarried and the groat majority of them with little probability of continuing in employment after marriege.If the whole of the cost of their benefits were recovered from married women of child-bearing ages it would be necessary to increase their contributions from 9d, to about 2s; apart from the manxiitude of tie sum it Would bo administratively impossible for the insurance contributions of married women (and  even then only certain of them) to be different from those of other-insured women.15.     If the new bonefit were made universal the cost of it could be provided, aa regards insured persons, by  a general increase of the contributions of both men and women by something like 4d. a week.   This would not include provision for additional expenses of administration, or meet the difficulty of the uninsured person.Any proposal to increase the contributions to this extent for tho purpose under discussion would probably meet with the strong opposition of tho insured, and of the employers also if it were proposed to divide the burden.   Even more serious opposition would come from those who are interested in the subject from the point of view of public health and who would see in the administration of the benefit b*; Approved Societies the negation of their hopes as to the beneficial results expected by them from the co-ordination of money grants and services in kind.(Signed).
