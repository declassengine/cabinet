LIQUOR CONTROL. 9?Memorandum by Sir John Pedder, Acting Chairman of the Central Control Jk)ard (Liquor TrafficJ.Unless fresh Parliamentary sanction is obtained it will not be long before the present control of the liquor traffic breaks down.The existing machinery cannot bo guaranteed to last until there has been an opportunity of permanent legislation on tho liquor problem in England, Wales and Scotland.   If it fails, the gains which hare resulted, as is universally admitted, from the restrictions placed on the sale of liquor during the war, will be lost.The present regime of shorter hours for the sale of liquor (as well as other restrictions which are very generally appro-vod) depends on Orders   made by the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) in areas in which the Beard was empowered to act by Regulations made by Order in Council uno.or the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) $0.3 Act, 1915.     These areas cover the greater part but not all of Great Britain.Very shortly after the termination of active hostilities an agitation arose for tho repeal or modification of the restrictions imposed by the  card.   This agitation has increased as time has passed.     Sometimes it comes to the fore in Par-liar-ment. and elsewhere, but, always it presses, upon the Board demands for relaxations;of the restrictions, which IS conceded would mean th3 beginning of the end.- In K-?y 1319, the Government were informed that the Liquor Control Board were of opinion that, as they were essentially.a-war body, it was desirable that a transfer of powers to a new authority suitable to peace conditions should not be unduly delayed.    On the 2nd July, 1919, Mr. Bonar Law announced in the House of Commons that a Bill to replace the Board by a Commission under a Hinister responsible to Parliament had been prepared and, would shortly be introduced.Bince that time the Eoard, having previously mado a number of relaxations of the restrictive provisions of its
Orders, has found it necessary to maintain an almost ^ ^meohanical non possumus attitude towardsdemands for further alterations.     Only in this way Is it possible to give effect to the wishes of the Government, and, is believed, the desire of tho country as a whole, that the relaxation of the restrictions shall not be carried so far as to prejudice the discussion and settlement&apos;in duo course by Par] lament of the regu-lations of the liquor traffic in oeacc time.The Liquor Control Board is subjected daily to vehement attacks which make it hopeloss that the position can long be continued to be held with success.The main lines of attack are (1) that the Liquor Control Board and its system of Orders aro a creation of the war and should cease with the w.--r,  (2) that, even if justifiable during the war, the difference between neighbouring areas, one of which may be under the Board1s restrictions while the adjoining one may be free from them, cannot be justified in time of peace, and (3) that the Board is free or nearly free from Parliamentary responsibility &apos;- an unconstItutIon** al and improper position.The technical answer to attack No, 1 is that the war is not yet officially at an end, and that after it ends the Board and its powers can be continued by Order In Council under the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) No, 3 Act 1915, for twelve months more.    This answer is good in law, but merely enrages the opponents of tho Board, and seems to the &quot;plain man&quot; juggling with words and a breach of the promise (which he believes to have been given) of the speedy cessation of all war&apos; restrictions.    Further, the Order in Council to keep the Board alivo - without which it must be remembered the whole- control will cease when the war reaches Its official end - would, just -because It is an Order In Council be extremely unpopular, and moreover would not  ive the fresh authority which Is necessary if the gains won in the war are to be maintained.This point is further illustrated in connection with attack No, 2*    It may be assumed to have- been right for the war restrictions to extend to one of several adjacent areas and not to the next, because, though before the war the areas may have been scarcely.  - distinguishable/
distinguishable) in character, during the war -one became engagdWin war work or constituted tho boundary of one so engaged and the other did not.    The Board1s powers were confined to safeguarding areas engaged in war work of one kind or another, and were therefore applicable to the one area and not to the other.    There is now no such distinction between cnc area and another and it is hard to justify the maintenance of the restrictions in one while the other is free from them./it tho same time no one really wishes to revert from the short hours to the old 16 or 19 drinking hours per day, and many persons in the areas which still have tho long hours would like them short-enod but the Board is in a perfectly powerless position.    It cannot release a restricted area without starting a process which would spread till the restrictions were removed from the greater part, if not the whole, of the country at present subject to them.     It cannot apply restrictions to any areas not at present subject to1 them because its powers arc confined to areas in which restrictions were found necessary for the successful prosecution of the war.This position, in which the Board is powerless to move forward and dare not wove backward for fear of losing all the ground gained, cannot be maintained much longer.    Further, this general impotence re-acts most unfavourably on the Direct Control Undertakings in Carlisle and elsewhere, which no responsible and disinterested person wishes to collapse, but which, stand in need of fresh sanction lastly the present position threatens to bring to a breaking point the cleavage of opinion between different members of the Board which is widening perceptibly as the war, which kept them together, recedes into the distance.Complaint No. 5 as to Parliamentary responsibility ought to be met.In short what is needed in order to preserve the main prlnci-pies and value of the present restrictions is an Act of Parliament relieving them of tho taint of D.O.R.A. (which inspires the loudest of the outcries against them) and enabling some authority rospon-siblo to Parliament through a iiinistcrof/
,pi         mm to-a-pply:- either by continuation or- modiflaratio^^Dg the existing Orders - similar i^e strict ions to the whole of Great Britain.    Such powers would not be limited by war considerations, and would avowedly bo temporary in character i.e., definitely for the purpose of holdinr and making good the -round gained, pending future developments and legislation.r With such fresh authority from Parliament it should be possible not only   to continue tho successful Direct Control Undor-takings but also to devise a modified code of regulations which (a) would be applicable   (with local variations) to tho whole of Groat Britain, (b) might in the main be- suitable for permanent adoption and (c) would at all events be proper for an interim period.The draft Bills annexed represent alternative plans for attaining this object.The essential feature of both Bills arc (1) to continue temporarily under fresh authority from Parliament the powers and practice of liquor control surviving from the &apos;;ar^- including the Direct Control Undertakings at Carlisle and elsewhere.     (2) To enable those powers to be exercised over the whole country without the artificial limits imposed by tho war conditions under which they originated.Provisions common, to both drafts (draft A clause 1(1) and draft 3 clause (1) give effect to No.2. (abovo) by giving statutory extension and authority for peace time- to the liquor control regu-latiohs which empower the Board to make Orders restricting the sale and control of liquor.The two drafts differ in their provisions for the purpose of securing the other essential feature (No.1.above) viz., Parliament-ary responsibility.Draft A, clause 1 (2) Is directed towards continuing the existing Central Control Board, but giving it a Parliamentary chairman, who,will, in fact, have to be a Minister with a salary of which the reduction can be moved.    The drafting of this sub-clause will require further consideration according to the decisionw hich/
which is taken as to the allocation of the ministerial responsibility, e.g. as respects the English and the Scottish parts of the Board&apos;e work.Draft B secures the nec-e-ssary parliamentary responsibility by (clauso 2) nesting tho powerand duties of the Central Control Board in a Minister, or, if the responsibility for England and Scotland must be divided, in two Ministers, and abolishing tho Loard,    The Hinister Trill carry out the duties etc., with such staff and advisers - whether called Comnissloners or other-wise - as ho may find necessary.    Some of the members of the present Board e. . the experts who supervise the Direct Control Undertakings would have to bo asked to continue to assist.The choice between the two drafts depends partly on Parliamentary and partly on practical administrative considerationsDraft A is in some ways the simplest, and mi^ht avoid tho raising of questions as to departmental responsibility for liquor administration in England and Scotland respectively, and also the charge of establishing a ne?r bureaucracy, though probably some change in the personnel of the Board and in the arrangement by which, so far, they have all been part time unpaid men would be necessary ,    It is,, however, not certain how far the present members of the Doard would &quot;be willing or able to continue in the new regime, or again whether the cleavage of opinion already indicated, instead of developing to the point of separation, would be healed by tho Bill and enable the Board to continue ef eoti vo aCblnistration*Draft B while possibly raising some of the points avoided by Draft A. nay offer a bettor likelihood of effective administra-tion, of an authoritative source of advice to the Government as to future legislation, and of a Parliamentary responsibility closer and more in accordance with the usual practice.        would further have tho advantage, for what it may be worth, of meeting $ae cry that the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) ought, as a child of D.O.R.A. to be got rid of - a cry in which oventhose/
