I(C.P.  H9;i1i   )J        Thio ^......- I . -    Jv of  &apos; ciCirculated by the Secretary of State for India, SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 2(jtk September 1920.Following is the weekly telegram : Report from Bengal on discussions in Subject Committee of Special Congress, shows Committee was divided (? into omitted) three groups : firstly, out-and-out supporters of Gandhi, consisting of Shaukat Ali, Ohakravarti, Yakub Hussain, &amp;c.; secondly, partial supporters, 0: R. Das, B. C. Pal, Malaviya ; and thirdly, definite&apos; opponents, Jinnah, Mrs. Besant, Dwarka Das, Jamna Das. Second party opposed withdrawal of children from schools, boycott of British Courts and withdrawal from council elections. Gandhi himself subjected to considerable heckling. Refused to admit policy would lead to violence and bloodshed, maintained would strengthen British connection and revolution only alternative. While deprecating violence, was prepared to see non-co-operators putting screw on co-opeiators. Pressed to declare next move should non-co-operation fail, he refused to contemplate such possibility. When feeling of Committee turned against him Gandhi intimated that he would carry on his policy whether Congress supported it or not, appealing to masses. Issue of co-operation or non-co-operation never put to vote. But after resolution adopted by Congress further meeting of Committee was held. C. It. Das pointed out legal objections to programme and dangers in prosecution, e.g:, under Corrupt Practices Act. A sub-Committee, consisting of Gandhi, Moti Lai Nehru and Patel, appointed to frame instructions to carry out programme, to be submitted to All-India Committee after a month ; in the meantime effect will be given to resolution wherever possible. Agreed in informal discussion that members who cannot accept the decision of majority and embrace practical non-co-operation must leave Congress. A suggested practical step is organisation of strike among lascars and ships&apos; employees with view to furthering boycott of foreign goods. Too early to gauge results or effect of adoption of programme at present, but 22 resignations or withdrawals from candidature for election beyond those adviseed last week reported from Bombay, including Bapatista, Karandikar and Kelkar. Gandhi now ill and recuperating at Bolpur. Work of Committee probably delayed by this. Gokaran Nath and Ishwar Saran of the United Provinces resigned Congress owing to non-co-operation policy. Bengal candidates who resigned voted in most cases against Gandhi and many had little chance of election. Extremist leaders will probably now mark time until Christmas Congress, when determined effort will be made to recapture Congress and rescind resolutions regarding school children and lawyers. In Press considerable discussion of constitution of Congress and decision on non-co-operation. Khaparde considers time come to recast constitution and to face great danger of manipulation of body at present unwieldy and ineffective and unable to give effect to modern idea of mass representation. Finally, question whether decision must be binding on all members freely discussed. Opinion divided. On immediate effective point in programme, namely, boycott of councils, Malaviya refuses to accept decision, and Gandhi has agreed no necessity in every case that Congress members should withdraw from election. At meeting Sholapur Sastri spoke strongly against non-co-operation.Provincial Opinion. Bombay. Report that opinion of Nationalist circles in fluid state on non-co-operation, and variable as regards boycott of councils. Khaparde will not withdraw. Baptista accused Gandhi of handing over Congress to Mohame-dans, but has withdrawn candidature out of loyalty (to) Congress. Gandhi&apos;s acceptance of boycott of foreign goods resented by wealthy Bombay merchants, mainstay of central Khilafat Committee. Reports from Sind indicate greatly improved atmosphere there.United Provinces. Agitation on Khilafat question shows no sign of abatement. Efforts continue to be made in the outlying towns and villages to reach masses. No practical results of non-co-operation yet apparent, but adoption of Gandhi&apos;s programme may give momentary impetus, especially as Gandhi and Shaukat Ali intend touring-province. Pandit Ram Narain, violent Khilafat lecturer, prosecuted under section 108, bound over, failed to give security. Little attempt to defend him on part of local bar, no demonstration when taken to jail. He and another paid itinerant agitator also being prosecuted under sections 163a and 124a Indian Penal Code. 2367     100 9.20
Bihar and Orissa, Resolution of Provincial Conference in favour of non-co-operation passed largely by votes (of) delegates from Kisan Sabhas (peasant associations), of whom 180 were present. This agrarian development, chiefly marked in Bihar and United Provinces, will require careful watching, as it may develop into no-reut movement, and might betaken up by Gandhi, if he does not get requisite support from educated classes.At Partabgarh, United Provinces, recently a large number of ryots collected to rescue by force a local leader of the movement who was being prosecuted, and a breach of the peace was with difficulty averted. Responsible political leaders of the province wholly opposed to non-co-operation movement, but doubtful whether they will stand openly against it. A Sadhu being prosecuted under section 131, Indian . * Penal Code, for tampering with troops.North West Frontier Province. Hijrat movement scotched at present. Work of repatriating returned Muhajarin proceeding steadily and successfully, and all classes of people co-operating in assisting officers on special duty to complete arrangements satisfactorily. Attempt of some leaders and mullahs to keep alive movement meeting with scanty success. It remains to be seen how far non-co-operation movement will advance.Punjab. Kitchlew will now, it is understood, lead non-co-operation movement. Zafar Ali (vide last week&apos;s telegram) being prosecuted under 124a and 153a Indian Penal Code.Gandhi&apos;s influence with masses very great. Willoughby&apos;s murder continues to be condemned, but Gandhi only half-heartedly condemned murder itself and made allowances for murderers. Shaukat Ali reported to advocate view non-co-operation merely trial of strength to be followed by murder of European officers and their Indian assistants. Disturbances occurred last week at Agra between Hindus and Mohamedans during local festival. Some 25 men, including three head constables, were injured. Meeting subsequently called by District Magistrate. Temper of the people unsatis-factory, and they refused arbitration. A public meeting also held, and later further ebullition of violence, lathis being freely used. Eventually delegation leaders pro-ceeded to Agra, called mass meeting of Hindus (?and) Mohamedans, and effected reconciliation ; shops opened and lawlessness came to end. Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces went to Agra, but latest Press messages show situation quiet, and Muharran passed off without further incident.Sporadic labour trouble. Oil workers&apos; strike, Madras, according to Press report just received, settled by intervention of Governor. Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company&apos;s employees restive, and strike occur (? red) amongst Europeans at Jam-shed pur, of whom.majority belong to English Unions and receive help from them.Serious disturbances at some tea gardens, Lakhimpur District, Assam, when Superintendent of Police and Assistant and Assistant Manager injured. Assam Rifles called in.Central Provinces Government has in deference to public opinion withdrawn Government support from Ratona abattoir (? question), and has cancelled agreement made with Company.In Assam and Bengal vigorous agitation being pursued for reversion of Sylhet to Bengal. Chief Commissioner has been authorised to issue communique denying various misleading rumours as to effect of present arrangements.Private Chilcott accused in Kacha Garhi case has been acquitted by court-martial.Indian Press, including some moderate papers, vigorously objecting to (? shipment of) all our Indian troops to Mesopotamia.
