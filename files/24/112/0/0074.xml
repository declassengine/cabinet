PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The coal situation, on the 13th October, was again approaching a crisis. The complete returns of the second ballot, for or against the owners&apos; output datum line proposal, had not yet been received; but it was already clear that the majority against the owners&apos; proposals would be exceptionally heavy. The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation met on this day in preparation for the National Delegate Conference on the following day; and upon the proceedings of this conference will largely depend immediate developments. The difficulties of the situation are the very short time which is available for negotiation before the expiry of the strike notices on the 16th, and the division of opinion on the output datum line proposal between the national and local leaders. The danger is that this difference of opinion may tend to paralyse the decisions of the National Delegate Conference, and leave, as the only clear line of policy to be pursued, the automatic operation of the strike notices. *With regard to the other aspects of the industrial situation, there have been no new developments of special interest during the week, but several important movements are proceeding. In the cotton and wool textile industries short time is already, or will shortly be, in operation. The piecers&apos; dispute in Lancashire is still giving trouble in some places. The. agreement in the bleaching, dyeing and finishing sections of the textile industries expires on the 17th of this month ; and negotiations are being opened for its modification and renewal. The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation have recommended their constituent unions, interested in the road transport negotiations, to postpone their strike notices until the 23rd, and a further meeting with the employers will take place in the course of next week.Attention is still widely drawn to the unemployment position, and London is again the centre of interest. Reports continue to be received of the proposals of local authorities to put into operation, in the coming winter, public works of varying magnitude, in order to relieve such distress as may occur amongst unskilled workers and ex-Service men. Many unions are actively considering their position under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.Considerable prominence has been given to the impending increase in the price of bread and flour to the consumer which will become operative on and after the 17th October. The Federation of British Industries issued in the course of the week a manifesto enunciat-ing their belief that the proper remedy for the present high level of prices is increased production.The Labour movement has shown keen interest in recent industrial developments in Italy, principally, of course, in the reports of the seizure of workshops by workers on strike in Northern Italy. Attention may therefore be drawn to a Press report, which has received considerable publicity, that the Italian Minister of Labour is to submit shortly to the Council of Ministers a proposal for the reform of the Higher Council of Labour. It is proposed that the Council shall be composed in future of over 150 members, elected directly and proportionately by employers and workers, and shall be competent to exercise such legislative functions in regard to the control of labour and conditions of employment as may be delegated to it by the Parliament.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 1st October was 162,591, made up of 162,040 lodged by men and 551 by women. On the 24th September there were 158,759 policies current, 158,217 for men and 542 for women.* $ee p. 458 footnote below.
The General Situation-continued.On the 1st October, 111,686 unemployment books, 77,336 for males and 34,350 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Corn-pared with, the previous week, when there were 71,263 books lodged by males and 31,812 by females, the total increase is 8,611.The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 462.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Labour and Russia. The Council of Action, who have been engaged in collecting information as to the supply of munitions and material to Poland, have now issued a report to the local Councils, and have convened a meeting, representative of the national bodies composing the National Council, for the 18th October. At this meeting the information obtained will be considered and future policy decided. The local Councils are asked to organise public demonstrations for the 17th October at which resolutions will be put demanding peace with Eussia and an immediate resumption of trade relations.The Hendon Local Council recently passed a resolution requesting the National Council to seek a mandate to extend their terms of reference to include Ireland.Housing. In connection with the building guild movement a conference took place in Manchester on the 9th October, under the presidency of Mr. Harry Frankland, chairman of the Manchester Building Guild Committee. The object of the meeting, which was attended by representatives of 48 guild committees and by 25 local representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, was to discuss the constitution of a National Building Guild, based upon representative and territorial principles. A Eeconstruction Committee of six was appointed to investigate and report upon the subject at a future meeting. Mr. $. G. Hobson spoke in condemnation of the Government^ housing policy, and a resolution was carried calling for the immediate decentralisation of the powers vested in the Ministry of Health. He also objected to the principle of direct labour so far as guilds are concerned, but conceded that, where no guild committee exists, direct labour schemes could be approved. Most of the points referred to by Mr. Hobson were afterwards made the subject of resolutions passed by the conference.A further step has been taken towards the formation of the Guild of Builders (London), Ltd., by the issue of a preliminary prospectus by the London district council of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. This document describes the con-stitution and organisation of the guild, the conditions of membership, &amp;c, and contains an appeal for a loan to cover the expenses incidental to the work of organisation.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. At a special meeting of the executive council of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, held in London on the 7th October, it was decided that members should be advised not to sign any papers in connection with the Act until the council have issued instructions regarding it.It is reported that the proposal that Chambers of Commerce&quot; shall co-operate with the National Federation of Employers&apos; Approved Societies in the administration of the Act has been accepted by the General Purposes Committee of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.Agricultural workers at Heamoor, Penzance, recently passed a resolution protesting against the exclusion of agricultural workers from the provisions of the Act, and decided to bring the matter before the Agricultural Wages Board.Relief of Unemployment. Many London Borough Councils have organised town&apos;s meetings, which are being held to consider&apos; the present situation in London and the prospects of employment during the coming winter months. At these meetings, resolu-tions demanding Government grants to enable local bodies to start relief works are for-mulated, and schemes for such works outlined. It is expected that the schemes of the Ministry of Transport for repairing roads this winter will absorb a considerable number of unemployed, but no estimate of the exact number that will be employed under the schemes is yet forthcoming.(b 16532) 3 N 2
At Coventry the &quot;Committee of the Unemployed &quot; * continue to organise meetings. The Mayor of Coventry is arranging a meeting of employers in the city at which the pos-sibility of working short time in the factories will be considered. In the meanwhile, the Coventry branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union have made a levy of 2s. Gd. weekly per member for the benefit of their unemployed members.Shorter Hours: Effect on Workers and Output-The annual report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops, for the year 1919, contains interesting information on some of the results of shorter working hours, the wide adoption of which was so marked a feature of that year. It is stated that the reports received from Inspectors show that the reduction in hours of work has had a beneficial effect on the operatives concerned, possibly greater than any other recent improvement in industrial conditions. The classes of workers who have probably benefited most by the change are the growing girl or boy, the worker possessing some vision and aspiration towards a fuller life, and the married woman. The abolition of work before breakfast is said to have resulted in better time-keeping. In one large factory, where the average number of daily absentees some years ago was 40, it is now 10, and in a large laundry there was a marked improvement in attendance, less sickness, and fewer cases of absence for general reasons such as attending to home affairs. In a large engineering works employing 1,200 men and boys, when the working day commenced at 6 a.m., at least 800 commenced work as late as 9 a.m. once a week; since the hours were reduced, and the workirfg day began at 7.30 a.m., only&apos;18 workers were late in a typical week.The effect on production varied according to circumstances. Where production depends almost entirely on the speed of machinery, as in cotton or woollen spinning, the output is said to be reduced in a proportion nearly, but not fully, corresponding to the re-duction in hours. In other machine operations, which call for constant alertness on the part of the worker, for example, weaving, output has not suffered to this extent, and in some cases has scarcely been affected at all. In a third class of process, where output is largely or entirely dependent upon the exertion of the worker, there is frequently no loss in production : and in a certain boot factory, where the hours of work were reduced from 52 to 48 per week, there was a considerable increase in output. On the other hand, in a few cases, the shortening of hours has been followed by a reduction in the hourly rate of production.The material in the report on these topics is of interest as being the latest authoritative pronouncement on the teachings of recent experience, as regards the relation of output to hours of work.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Sailors and Firemen&apos;&apos;s Union. The annual conference of this union was held on the 6th, 7th and 8th October in London. Mr. J. Havelock Wilson, M.P., presided. The first day&apos;s session was devoted entirely to domestic questions. On the second day the result was declared of the double ballot on the questions of the nationalisation of the shipping industry, and the affiliation of the union to the Labour Party. The result showed a majority of 11,061 against the nationalisation proposal, and a majority of 6,576 in favour of affiliation with the Labour Party. The voting was as follows : For nationalisa-tion, 5,097 ; against, 16,158; neutral, 3,078; for joining the Labour Party, 13,091 ; against, 6,515 ; neutral, 5,429. In view of the vote in favour of affiliating to the Labour Party, the conference then discussed the position of Mr. Havelock Wilson, who stated that he intends to maintain his attitude of opposition to the step. It was finally decided that Mr. Wilson should be allowed preferential treatment, and permitted independence of action where political questions are concerned.OtheT questions discussed on the 7th and 8th October were the employment of foreign labour, wages which question, it was explained, is to come before the National Maritime Board in a fortnights time and hours. In regard to hours, it was agreed to accept the French system, under which, according to the explanation given at the conference, the hours of firemen and seamen are fixed at 48 and 56 per week,f respectively, with com-pensation for all hours worked over 48 per week while at sea. When in port, the working week is to consist of 44 hours.* See this Eeport,. Vol. II., No. 15, 9th Octobejr, p. 432.f Although the French law of the 2nd August, 1919, is described as &quot;fixing at eight hours per day the length of work in vessels used for maritime navigation,&quot; under its provisions a 56-hour week is in certain circumstances permitted, provided that compensation is given in the form of &quot; time off&quot; for the additional hours worked.
45716.10.20.Labour and Co-operative Political Alliance. The principal matter before the general quarterly meeting of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, held at Manchester on the 9th October, was a motion instructing the directors of the society to consult with the National Committee of the Co-operative Party concerning the methods by which the society can best help in carrying out the policy of the party, and to present their report thereon to the quarterly meeting in January next. Included in the policy of the Co-operative Party is the establishment of a Labour and Co-operative Political Alliance.At the Manchester meeting the resolution was lost by 82 votes; but the votes cast at the eight divisional meetings held on the 2nd October have also to be taken into con-sideration; and the result thus obtained shows 1,209 votes for the resolution and 1,112 against. The directors of the Society, therefore, will now have to adopt the policy outlined in the resolution.Trade Union Topics.Monmouthshire and South Wales Colliery Enginemen, Stokers and Craftsmen&apos;s Asso-ciation. The third ballot on the question of amalgamation with the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation* has now been taken. The necessary 20 per cent, majority in favour of amalgamation has been obtained, 3,512 voting for amalgamation and 1,367 against.Railway Shopmen. An agreement with regard to the programme which is to be put forward on behalf of railway shopmen has at length resulted from the prolonged negotia-tions between the National Union of Railwaymen and the craft unions catering for shop workers. The final settlement was made at a meeting at Unity House on the 28th September, when it was agreed that the two parties should negotiate jointly with the railway companies for the claims submitted in September, 1919.Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners. The proposals for the amalgamation of this society and the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners have now been accepted by both parties. The new organisation, which will be known as the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, will come formally into existence on the 1st January.Ex-Service Men.National Union of Ex-Service Men. Several branches of the union are pressing the executive to call a national general conference to consider the position of the organisation, and have refused to accept the recent referendum on reconstruction as binding. It is possible that these branches will break away from the union, and be absorbed in some other ex-Service or political organisation.Employment of Ex-Service Men. It is announced that a special campaign for the employment of ex-Service men is to take place during the week ending the 13th November, which will be known as &quot; Obligation Week.&quot; Earl Haig addressed several meetings in Edinburgh last week in furtherance of his campaign for the relief of distress among ex-Service men and their dependants.International Relations of Labour.International Transport Workers&apos; Federation. Information with regard to the activities of this Federation is given in the official report of a special meeting of the executive council of the National Union of Railwaymen, on the 11th October. The meeting received an invitation from the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation to send representatives to a conference, to be held in London on the 29th November, to review the situation in regard to the application of the eight-hour day to the various national railway systems. The whole of the executive council, of the National Union of Railwaymen will attend the conference. The International Federation had also asked the National Union of Railwaymen to define their policy on two questions, (a) whether they were prepared to caTry on a propaganda against militarism and war generally ; and (b) whether they were prepared to give the executive council of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation full power to call a general strike in the event of war being declared. The executive council decided that they were prepared to support the propaganda referred to in the first question, but that, with regard to the second question, they should consult the General Meeting, which is the governing body of the union. This question will therefore appear upon the agenda of the next special General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen.* Bee this Keport, Vol. II., No. 11, 11th September, p. 337.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Coal Miners (National). In connection with the ballot of the Miners&apos; Federation the significant feature of the week has been the declarations of many national miners&apos; leaders, urging the men to vote in favour of acceptance of the owners&apos; proposals. These declarations are in strong contrast with the many recommendations of various local representative, bodies of the miners&apos; unions, hostile to the owners&apos; offer, which were recorded last week.On the 7th October, Mr. Robert Smillie issued a strong recommendation to the membership of the Miners&apos; Federation to accept the owners&apos; offer, as a temporary expedient which would provide an interval of three months for the elaboration of a national agree-ment covering the whole question of miners&apos; wages and working conditions. Mr. W. Straker, in a circular issued to the members of the Northumberland Miners&apos; Mutual Confident Association, has advised the men to accept the offer and stated that he sees no chance of a successful issue to a strike. On the 7th, also, the Council of the Mining Association unanimously endorsed the pledge given by their president that they would co-operate to the fullest extent with the miners, and do their utmost to increase the output of coal by the formation of national and district committees, and by all other available means. The council of the Durham Miners&apos; Association, on the 9th October, however, unanimously decided to recommend members to vote against the owners&apos; offer. At the meeting of the council of the Northumberland Miners&apos; Mutual Confident Association, on the 9th, there was a majority of only 10 votes for rejection; and the delegates to the meeting of the 14th were instructed, in the event of the ballot vote going against acceptance of the datum line, to press for reference of the wages demand to an impartial tribunal.The ballot of the membership of the Miners&apos; Federation concluded on the 12th October, and the executive of the Federation considered the position on the 13th.*Engineers and Shipbuilders (National). The four-monthly period for the operation of the last Awards of the Industrial Court for the engineering and shipbuilding trades will expire at the end of November. The trade unions concerned have denounced the agreement of February, 1917, under which the periodic hearings have been held, and are putting forward direct applications for advances in wages. The application from the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades for an increase of Qd. per hour for time-workers, and an equivalent percentage advance on piece-work rates,f was considered at a preliminary conference, on the 8th October, with the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, so far as the claim related to workers engaged in shipbuilding and ship-repairing. It is understood that the employers made a great point of the depressed state of the industry ; and the conference was adjourned until the 22nd October in order that their views might be placed before the members of the affiliated unions. The National Federation of General Workers forwarded a similar demand on the 11th, to the engineering and shipbuilding employers and to the controlled railways, on behalf of all members of unions affiliated to the Federation employed in engineering and shipbuilding and in railway workshops. Negotiations on a similar demand also opened on the 13th between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations.Textile Printing, Bleaching, Dyeing and Finishing Operatives (Lancashire, York-shire, Cheshire and Derbyshire). At a conference in Manchester on the 11th October, negotiations broke down between representatives of the employers and of the employees in this industry over the workers&apos; claim for a 40 per cent, advance on current rates and a minimum of 25 per cent, over day-rates for piece-workers. The National Society of Dyers and Finishers, the Amalgamated Society of Dyers, Bleachers, Finishers and Kindred Trades, and the Operative Bleachers&apos;, Dyers&apos; and Finishers&apos; Association, Bolton Amal-gamation, together with nine other allied trade unions, representing in all 80,000 workers, are involved in the dispute. Negotiations have beer, conducted on the operatives&apos; side through a &quot; Joint Movement,&quot; of which Mr. A. Shaw, Secretary of the National Society of Dyers and Finishers, is acting as corresponding secretary.  Both sides have agreed* The result of the ballot showed 181,428 votes in favour of accepting the owners&apos; offer and 635,098 against. On the 14th the National Delegate Conference.adopted by 154 votes to 27 the executive^ recommendation that the strike notices should be allowed to expire on the 16th.f See this Report, Vol. II., No. 14, 2nd October, p. 412.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.to the principle of arbitration: their chief point of difference is as to its form, the em-ployers proposing a reference to the Industrial Court, and the operatives suggesting private arbitration outside the Industrial Court.It has been arranged that the existing agreements, which expire on the 17th October, shall continue provisionally, subject to one week&apos;s notice from either side.Coal Tippers (National).-Representatives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen on the one hand, and of the dock authorities and railway companies on the other, held a conference in London, on the 7th October, to consider the wages demand put forward on behalf of the coal tippers engaged at the various ports throughout the country, and to discuss the question of the reinstatement of men who have been discharged during periods of slackness. With regard to the wages claim, a temporary offer was made by the employers, to which the two unions concerned are giving consideration. On the point of the dismissals of coal tippers at Cardiff and other places, the men&apos;s representatives claimed that the last agreement of the 26th March, extending the minimum wage, carried with it the retention of the men in employment until the termination of the agreement on the 30th September. The railway companies, however, claimed the right of dismissal, and definitely refused the offer of the men&apos;s representatives to refer the interpretation of obligations under the agreement to arbitration.Fruit Porters (Covent Garden). About 2,500 men are understood to be involved in the present dispute at Covent Garden Market over the demand of the fruit porters, who belong to the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, for a uniform rate, implying a 100 per cent, increase, for carrying loads from the dealers&apos; stands to retailers&apos; vehicles in Long Acre. ;Printers (National). Negotiations were resumed in London on the 7th October between representatives of the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades and the provincial newspaper organisations on the one side, and the executive of the Typographical Association on the other, to consider the application by the Typographical Association for an increase in wages for all its members. Various proposals were discussed, and the conference adjourned in order that the proposals might be submitted to a special meeting of the council of the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades, which is to take place this week.The administrative council of the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation also met in London on the 12th October, to consider the offer of the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades and the newspaper organisations, in regard to the claim of the federation for a flat rate increase of 15s. a week for men and 7s. Qd. for women. The council decided to reject the employers&apos; offer, and to proceed with further negotiations on their original claim.Rubber Operatives. With reference to the applications for increased wages submitted on the 15th June by the Workers&apos; Union, and the Gas, Municipal, and General Workers&apos; Union, to the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., it is reported that negotiations are suspended pending the decision of the Government regarding the two day-shift system.Clerical and Administrative Workers: Mining Industry (South Wales). The ballot of the members of the Mining, Clerical and Administrative Workers&apos; Guild has resulted in a large majority in favour of drastic action to enforce the adoption by the South Wales Coal Owners&apos; Association of the proposed new scale of salaries and the establishment of a joint Wages Board. It is expected that notices will be tendered when the present coal crisis has passed.Co-operative Employees (North of England). With reference to their claim for an advance in wages, members of the. northern division of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers have handed in notices which expire on the 16th October. Negotiations have taken place between the union and the societies concerned, but so far no settlement has been arranged owing to the fact that the retail societies in the South Durham, Cleveland and Cumberland areas will not come into line with the societies in the other districts.Strikes and Lock-outs.Builders (Manchester). The men employed by the Manchester Corporation in house-building on the Gorton Mount estate have ceased work, consequent upon the Corporation^ decision to defer consideration of the Housing Committee&apos;s proposal for a &quot; guaranteed week&quot; under all weather conditions.  On the 11th October, the Housing Committee
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.reaffirmed its recommendation to guarantee &quot; wet weather &quot; pay, and appointed a deputa-tion to impress upon the Ministry of Health the immediate importance of this matter; but the men have announced their intention of not returning to work until the matter is settled.Piecers (Shaw). Although a general resumption of work in connection with the unauthorized strike&quot;of spinners, which began in the Oldham area on the 15th September, was reported last week, a considerable amount of unrest is still in evidence. For example, at Shaw on the 11th October, in consequence of the agreements arrived at between the piecers and the shop stewards of their respective mills, practically all the piecers returned to work on the understanding, in the majority of cases, that their wages would be fixed on a more reasonable proportionate basis. On the 12th, however, sectional strikes on the part of big and little piecers again broke out at the same place. These strikes are attributed to the piecers&apos; uncertainty as to what steps their firms are taking with regard to the allocation of their wages.Seamen and Firemen (Dublin). The Dublin members of the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union have repudiated the decision of the National Maritime Board, on the 29th September, to postpone for two months the claim for increased wages, and have struck work to enforce an immediate settlement of their demand for an increase of  1 per week. The strike is unofficial and is not recognised by the union. It has spread, however, to other ports in the South of Ireland, and has created grave unemployment in Dublin itself. Through the intervention of Mr. W. 0&apos;Brien, formerly president of the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, a deputation of the strikers, on the 11th October, waited upon Mr. D. Barry, the&apos; Irish manager of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company.  The meeting broke up, however, without reaching a settlement.Settlements and Agreements.Engineers (Manchester). The decision of the engineers employed on maintenance work in the Manchester area to continue the prohibition of overtime was rescinded by a mass meeting of the men concerned on the 10th October. The meeting, however, made the withdrawal of the prohibition conditional upon the result of their demand for an increase of wages which is to be considered at the adjourned Central Conference at York on the 14th October.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements, are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Departments section of the Report, pages 474 to 476.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.Special General Order.As a consequence of the experience gained since the appointment of Sir David J. Shackleton, K.C.B., and Sir James Masterton Smith, K.C.B., to be Joint Permanent Secre-taries of the Ministry of Labour, the Minister has approved the following arrangements.For all office purposes Sir David Shackleton will have the designation of Chief Labour Adviser (C.L.A.) All questions which require either (a) consideration of the general labour policy of the Ministry in relation to employers&apos; associations or trade unions, or (b) advice or assistance on matters involving negotiation, or which raise important points of policy affecting employment, wages and hours, disputes, Trade Boards, Joint Industrial Councils, and industrial organisation generally, will be referred to Sir David Shackleton as C.L.A.For all office purposes, Sir James Masterton Smith will have the designation of Secre-tary of the Ministry, and will be responsible to the Minister for the organisation and general management of all departments of the Ministry of Labour.Further, with a view to simplifying the office machinery of the Ministry of Labour and in order to define with precision the distribution of functions under the Secretary, the Minister has approved the following organisation.The permanent work of the Department divides itself into two broad groups : (a) the central body of general administration which relates to employment and conditions of employment, including relations between employer and employed, and the formulation of general Government labour policy for submission to the Minister;(b) the group of common services, which includes the control of finance, thecontrol of establishments, and legal advice to the Ministry.In addition, there are the special after-war responsibilities at present discharged by the three temporary departments the Training, Appointments, and Civil Liabilities Departments.So far .as the permanent work of the Department is concerned, the Second Secretary will continue to assist the Secretary in the general direction of Ministry business as may from time to time be convenient. Subject to this, the work of the central administrative group will be assigned to three officers. The names of the groups, the subjects dealt with, and the officers responsible, will be as follows : GENERAL.REORGANISATION OF THE DEPARTMENT.Mr. H. J.

Employment Department-continued.Men&apos;s Employment:Shipbuilding and Other Industries. There is little or no change in the shipbuilding and allied industries. In Scotland there are still indications that a shortage of material is the principal cause of unemployment in the shipyards, and it is apparent that many employers are refraining from engaging additional labour pending a settlement of the coal crisis. On the Tyne, ship platers and riveters are being adversely affected by the erratic delivery of plates. The ship-repairing industry in. this area shows only a slight improve-ment. On the Tees, employment is reported to be good, and the shipbuilding and engineer-ing trades are absorbing their full complement of workpeople. In the Liverpool district the shipyard strike is diverting repair work to the North-East ports and to the Continent. The general slackness reported from South Wales and the Bristol Channel is ascribed in a large measure to the diversion of tonnage owing to the coal crisis.In the North-Western Division, the disturbing influence on industry produced by the dispute in the coal trade still remains. The cautious attitude adopted by many firms is typified by the Ford Motor Co., Ltd., Trafford Park, who hold very numerous orders, but will not engage more labour until the coal question is finally settled.The reports from the cotton trade districts again indicate a widespread curtailment of production. One reason given for the stagnation in this industry is the rate of exchange, another the difficulty of securing payments for orders already executed, and a third that manufacturers hold large stocks of yarn made from very high-priced materials which cannot be sold at present prices without serious loss.There are indications of improvement in the boot and shoe industry. A large number of inquiries are in hand for cheap boots for the Continent, and one or &apos;two factories have secured orders and have resumed full time.Unemployment continues to be on an abnormal scale in the hosiery, textile and motor industries.   On the other hand, employment in the pottery industry is good. .Industrial Developments. At Nuneaton three new factories are in course of erection. It has also been decided to proceed with a new engineering works capable of employing 500 men. Messrs. Tarrant &amp; Sons, Byfleet, are erecting extensive sawmills at Shrewsbury, where they contemplate carrying out a housing scheme for their employees. Aberystwyth report that a new company has been formed to develop the slate quarries at Glogue, a project which, it is understood, will result in the immediate employment of 400 additional men.Labour Reductions. At Hackney, Messrs. John Broadwood &amp; Sons, Ltd., piano manufacturers, have discharged 280 men. At Brixton, the British Motor Cab Co., Ltd., are discharging 100 hands from their fitting shop. Owing to shortage of orders, the National Radiator Co., Ltd., Hull, have discharged 200 workers, the Raleigh Cycle -Co.j Ltd., Netherfleld, 500 men, Messrs. Steel, Peach &amp; Tozer, Ltd., Rotherham, 1,000 men, Messrs. Richardson, Sheffield, automobile engineers, 200 men, and Messrs. Fodens, Ltd., Sandbach, engineers, 170 men.Shortage of Labour. The situation in regard to building labour in the country as a whole remains unaltered. The principal additional occupations in which there is a marked shortage of labour are those of moulders, puddlers, coremakers, wagon repairers and builders, and coach body makers. -Shortage of Material. In addition to the difficulties mentioned above, the Middles-brough rolling mills of the North Eastern Steel Co., Ltd., have closed for a week owing to a shortage of steel. Difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of cement are reported from Walsall, Folkestone, Enfield and Camberwell. The Associated Equipment Co., Ltd., Walthamstow, are discharging mechanics owing to a shortage of material. A shortage of steel plates is reported to be retarding the activities of Messrs. J. Butler &amp; Co., Stanningley.Women&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation. Increasing prevalence of short time is reported all over the country. A certain number of discharges are also taking place, and, generally, both under-employment and unemployment are on the increase.In the North-Western Division unemployment among women in the textile areas is becoming abnormal. Where unemployment is specially acute, many have exhausted the benefit due from their association. Depression in the hatting, wholesale clothing and slipper industries continues. There is still a shortage of weavers, though the demand has greatly decreased. In certain parts there is an unsatisfied demand for skilled underclothing machinists, nurse probationers, cigarette makers and confectioners.
Employment Department-contmutd.Increasing short time is reported from the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division in the woollen and worsted textile industries, and in the clothing, hosiery and lace trades. The latter, industries are also slack in the South Midlands and Eastern Division.Acute depression in all factory employment continues in London. Depression is reported from Scotland in the textile, linen and jute industries. The West Midlands Division continue to report slackness in most staple industries, notably the engineering, jewellery, clothing, leather, rubber, boot and shoe, and silk trades. Activity in the pottery trade is great, but hampered in certain cases by a shortage of skilled workers. There is some depression in the clothing industries in the South-Western Division. The tinplate industry in Wales appears to be fairly normal. In the Northern Division there is slack-ness in the ropery works, where women are being discharged, but otherwise the situation is normal.Local Reports. The live registers in London are in many cases being increased by the return of women from hop picking. Great Marlborough Street Exchange state that the slump in the clothing trade continues, but that there is increased activity amongst sweet and confectionery manufacturers caused by the approaching Christmas season.The Yeovil Exchange report that women in the glove-making industry are fully employed.The tailoring trade is on systematic short time at Dudley. A clothing factory, employing about 800 women, is on short time at Newcastle-under-Lyme. Wholesale clothing workers are on short time at Tamworth. At Stourbridge short time is being generally worked in the hollow-ware and brick trades. At Coventry the live register is increasing. Leather workers at Walsall are very slack, and unskilled women are urgently asking for any available employment. There is no local unemployment among women in the carpet industry at Kidderminster. There is a shortage of skilled workers for needle and fly dressing at Redditch.At Leicester, 75 per cent, of the boot and shoe operatives are working short time. The printing trade shows no improvement, and cardboard box making is slack. The hosiery trade at Loughborough remains very quiet.At Basford, unemployment is increasing, and about 800 workers are working short time. At Bradford, few vacancies are notified for mill hands, and trade is quiet. At Castleford, many tailoresses are claiming unemployment benefit. Hosiery workers, lace and net workers, corset and belt workers, cardboard box, and boot and shoe workers are on short time in Derby, and unemployment is increasing. At Dewsbury. the rag trade is very bad. Firms making low-grade cloths in this town are apprehensive of a collapse, as buyers are said to be taking advantage of the customary option of cancelling orders. At Hebden Bridge, 90 per cent, of the clothing trade is slack, although skilled machinists are -still in demand. At Nottingham slackness in the lace, blouse and hosiery trade continues. All employers are trying to systematise short-time working. At Hull, Messrs. F. Atkins &amp; Co., Ltd., tin canister manufacturers, have discharged from 50 to 100 women.-The owners of a large sweet factory have been induced to take on suitable candidates from the discharged women, for work previously done by juveniles.The North-Western Division report that extended holidays in the cotton industry are being taken in the Accrington district. At Blackburn 16 weaving sheds are closed down; 10,000 looms are affected, and last week  8,000 was distributed as stoppage pay in the . area. Slackness is spreading to the Bolton district, and, in the Burnley district, the depression is becoming more marked. At Darwen the situation is rapidly growing worse. Short time is being worked in Chorley, Eccles, Farnworth, Rochdale and Tyldesley. At Glossop there has been an improvement; full time is being worked at almost all the mills in the district. There is still a shortage of weavers at Farnworth, Heywood, Pendlebury, Radcliffe, Stalybridge, Stockport and Wigan. The difficulty is due to the unwillingness of workers to migrate, and the lack of suitable lodging accommodation.Aberdeen report a slight revival in local trade, but that a number of fish workers have gone to Lowestoft and Yarmouth owing to the poor season in the North. Stornoway also report that 900 girls went to Yarmouth and Lowestoft during the week.At Arbroath, depression in the flax trade is reported. Clydebank state that there is little hope of placing the semi-skilled workers recently discharged by the Singer Manu-facturing Co., Ltd. Factory workers are still being discharged from the linen industry of Dunferniline. At Irvine, short time is being worked in the hosiery trade, and the spinning mills at Kirkcaldy are also working short time.
OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 30th September, show 145,210 payments to policy holders involving an amount of  151,751 9s. 2d. The total amount disbursed to date is  55,677,708.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 24th September was 45,638, involving an amount of  23,967 4s. 9d.Unemployment Fund. The balance standing to the credit of the Unemployment Fund on the 24th September was  21,651,163. During the period from the 28th August to the 24th September,  160,000 was transferred to the National Debt Commissioners for investment, making the total sum transferred  21,710,000.Advances to Workpeople. The number of advances made in August was 4,839, divided into 1,509 recoverable advances, and 3,330 non-recoverable advances. The total amount of recoverable advances was  1,224, compared with a total for July of  1,315.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Constitution and Powers.-The Plymouth Committee discussed the appointment by the Minister of a representative of the Comrades of the Great War as an additional member. It was stated that the Labour members would resign if the committee supported the Ministers action.   Eventually it was decided to defer the question for a month.Employment and Resettlement. Birkenhead discussed the excessive unemployment in the area, and decided to appoint a deputation to interview the heads of the different local authorities to press for the initiation of schemes of public work. A resolution was passed impressing upon the Minister of Labour the importance of urging upon the Ministry of Pensions the desirability of arranging to transfer to full pensions, for the next six months, all men proved to be unable to obtain any employment in consequence of their disability. The Dover Committee request the Minister to urge the Government to initiate works of national and local importance in order to tide over the period of industrial depression, and for this purpose, to divide the country into convenient areas, each under a committee with power to draw up schemes for Government sanction, and to put them into effect.Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance. The Great Marlborough Street Committee are of the opinion that the maintenance grant for women trainees should be raised to meet the rise in the cost of living, especially where girls live away from home.Miscellaneous. The Faversham Committee recommend that a list of the various industries affected by the Trade Boards Acts, together with the relevant schedules, should be kept at the Employment Exchange for reference.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 6th October, 21,142 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 247,244 disabled ex-Service men.The Leicester Employment Committee, on learning that, in the Cripples&apos; Guild in Leicester, crippled girls, when supplied with spinal chairs, can earn from 25 to 28 shillings weekly, decided to formulate a scheme whereby openings could be created in this direction for men of 100 per cent, disability.A further appeal has been sent to all the more important clubs, hotels and restaurant in London.Employment Department-continued.
Employment Department-continued.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Unemployment.-V&amp;v serious amount of unemployment among juveniles in Bristol lias led the Juvenile Advisory Committee to appoint a sub-committee to consider the problem. It is estimated that some 600 boys and 300 girls in Bristol are unemployed, and that, of these, 350 boys and 150 girls are straight from school. These numbers will be considerably augmented by the children leaving school in October and at Christmas.The committee recommended that the local education authority should be asked to set up centres for unemployed juveniles, and that any benefit payable under the Un-employment Insurance Act, 1920, should be made conditional upon attendance ; that the serious position should be impressed upon parents and children, and that every effort should be made to keep the children at school till work is found ; and that the local education authority be asked to consider raising the school-leaving age to 15, and, in order to.meet the difficulty of school accommodation, to raise the age of entry from 5 to 6 years.A number of other committees have endorsed the resolution of the Liverpool Com-mittee that centres, with recreational and educational facilities, should be provided. Some have recommended the immediate raising of the school-leaving age to 15, certificates of exemption to be issued when suitable employment is obtained.Boy Operators in Cinemas. The chairman of the Stockport Juvenile Employment Committee has drawn attention to the undesirable conditions under which boys are em-ployed in the operators box in cinema theatres. The heat is stated to be from 100 to. 105 degrees. A case was quoted where a boy of 15 was employed continuously from 2 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. on six days a week, in addition to two hours cleaning work each morning.   An inquiry is being made into the conditions prevailing in other areas.Granite-cutting Industry (Aberdeen). A conference with representatives of employers and workpeople, the education authority and medical practitioners, was recently convened by the Aberdeen Juvenile Advisory Committee, to consider the training and health of juveniles in the granite-cutting industry. It was stated that, in 1904,472 apprentices were employed, against 63 in July last. A representative of the workpeople stated that the Scottish Trades Union Congress were making overtures to secure the inclusion of granite working in the list of dangerous trades. It was decided that the employers should consider the whole question, with a view to improving conditions, and should then meet representa-tives of the workpeople.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 454, 455, 461, 471, 472 and 473.]APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS DEPARTMENT. APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 1st October, the Appointments Department placed 489 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 41,836. Of these, 5,696 were placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards.&apos; Applications were registered from 739 ex-Service men and 30 civilians. The total of candidates available for appointments on the 1st October was 11,602 ex-Service men and 1,788 civilians. At the same date 1,407 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 585 having been registered during the week.Reports from Directorates. The Director at Perth reports that during the last few weeks a large number of qualified chemists have registered. Most of these applicants have been placed in vacancies at home and overseas advertised in the Press.At Edinburgh, even where an applicant is willing to accept a very humble position, it is almost impossible to get employers to accept men of maturer years. A lieutenant-colonel, aged about 60, has been placed in temporary employment at a salary of  3 10s. per week.
Appointments and Training-continued.Following on The Times campaign on behalf of ex-officers and the King&apos;s letter to Lord Mayors, civic committees have been set up at Newcastle-on-Tyne and Hartlepool. The department are fully represented on both. Other towns in the same directorate are not in favour of forming civic committees, as they consider that a sufficient number of boards and committees are in existence, and that unemployment statistics are better than in pre-war days.The Director at Birmingham reports that a circular letter was recently addressed to the college bursars of Oxford, inviting their co-operation in the employment of ex-ranker officers as stewards, assistant bursars and in similar positions. Favourable replies have been received from most of the colleges.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 1st October the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 112 ex-officers and men of equal educational qualifications, of which 65 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,349 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all,- and 50,504 for training of the types provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,110 applications, of which 22,784 have been recom-mended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,565 applications and sanctioned grants in 17,788 cases.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 853 cases, in 409 of which the training sanctioned is pro-vided by the Appointments Department and in the remainder by other Government departments^ Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 206 cases and abandoned training in 39; 142 are still in training and 22 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistical. On the 6th October, 25,049 men were in training, as against 25,176 on the 29th September, and 24,647 on the 8th September. There were 17,326 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 29th September and the 8th September being 18,426 and 19,749 respectively. The number of men whose training had been com-pleted since the 1st August, 1919, was 17,744, the totals for the 29th September and the 8th September being 17,234 and 16,091 respectively.For some little time past between 500 and 600 men have been placed in training each week. The general position cannot be regarded as unsatisfactory. Restrictions on admission to certain trades, however, are hindering rapid development, and any marked increase in unemployment may tend to swell the waiting lists once more.In Scotland, disabled men are receiving training in 91 different callings, ranging from boot making and repairing to diamond cutting.Fish Trade. A special feature of training work in the North of Scotland is the arrange-ment made for workshop instruction in the processes of fish splitting and filleting. The firms to which the men have been attached have recently been visited, and are all well satisfied. Most of the men will probably be retained&apos; by the firms for whom they are now working.Toy-making. A firm at Colwall, Herefordshire, have offered to train 40 men in wood-working for the manufacture of articles of domestic utility, and in toy-making ; the latter trade being reserved for the more seriously disabled. Permanent employment is offered by the firm on completion of training, and a start has been made with 21 men. As Colwall is a health resort, the training will be carried out in particularly favourable conditions.Hostels. The United Service Fund has made a grant of  700 for recreation purposes at Sarisbury Court. An application for a grant has been sent to the Fund on behalf of the Cathcart Factory, which has recently received a welfare grant of  220 from the department. The department has also made a grant of just over  100 in respect of the new residential Factory at Luton.
Appointments and Training-continued.Government Instructional Factories. The Ponders End and Romford Factories have come on to the active list this week. At the former, an electrical engineering course has started with seven men, and a rural handicrafts class is expected to open shortly. At Romford a start has been made with six carpenters and five bricklayers.Good progress has been made with the Belfast Factory scheme which will, in the first instance, provide places for 212 men. Training in vehicle building and in the furniture, joinery, electrical, tailoring, tinsmithing and hairdressing trades is to be started as soon as possible.Equipment and Supplies. Large quantities of wood-working tools have been received, and also supplies of shoemakers&apos;, bricklayers&apos; and plumbers&apos; tools.National Trade Advisory Committees: Wholesale Tailoring. A meeting was held on the 30th September. The committee is composed of the Administrative Committee of the Wholesale Tailoring Trade Board, and has not met since the re-organisation of the Tailoring Trade Board early this year. The Report on Openings in Industry, drawn up in December, 1917, was discussed, and it was felt that the changes necessary in employers&apos; payments were too important to be decided without referring them back to the associations involved.Local Technical Advisory Committees: Boot and Shoe. Local Technical Advisory Committees have held their first meetings at Southend, Maidstone, Redhill and Croydon. In each case the committee propose to visit the existing technical school class at an early date, and to take any steps which may be necessary to make the class more efficient.Local Technical Advisory Committees: Glass Trade. The secretary of the National Trade Advisory Committee attended the inaugural meeting of the Liverpool Local Technical Advisory Committee, which includes St. Helens, on the 30th September. It was agreed that training should be approved in the processes of glass bottle making by hand and glass bottle making on semi-automatic machines.Apprentices Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 6th October, 41 schemes had been approved. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 27th September, was 448, making a total of 44,772. The number of applications received from apprentices was 500, making a total of 50,355.Up to the 6th October, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 43,726 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 41,707 apprentices, employed by 16,408 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 11,349.Applications. Local headquarters for the Northern area have been successful in providing for more of their &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices. Six have been placed On a month&apos;s trial with the Northern General Transport Co., Ltd., Chester-le-Street, who have under-taken, if they are satisfactory, to bring them under the scheme.At Aberdeen, the outlook is not encouraging. The attention of the Local Employment Committee was drawn to the number of unemployed apprentices in their district; they reported that everything possible has been done to find them employment, and that no reduction in their number can be hoped for, till trade becomes brisker.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. At Burton-on-Trent the scheme appears to be generally accepted by the small shopkeepers, who are well satisfied with its working. Messrs. Bridgeman &amp; Co., Lichfield, stone and wood carvers, who have several eligible apprentices, allege that they cannot adopt the scheme, because their trained workmen &quot; simply will not allow it.&quot;The workmen of Messrs. Howard &amp; Bullough, Ltd., Accrington, engineers, raised difficulties about bringing certain apprentices under the engineering scheme. They feared that only the employers would benefit by its adoption. There was a stoppage of a few hours in the shop where the apprentices were employed; but a satisfactory settlement has been secured.Training in Operation: Progress-Local headquarters for Wales are not altogether satisfied with the prevailing methods of training, though generally the apprentices under the scheme are doing well.Messrs. Ruston &amp; Hornby, Lincoln, engineers, have shown every consideration to their apprentices, and given them an experience that is really first-class. The firm have taken considerable care to avoid discharging or suspending the apprentices during slackness.
Appointments and Training-continued.Unemployment. An increase in applications for institutional training in the Northern area is due in part to the prevailing unemployment, and some firms have suggested this course to their apprentices as an alternative to suspension. Owing to shortage of materials, Messrs. Campbell &amp; Calderwood, Paisley, engineers, have been compelled to suspend their apprentices generally for one week in four, but, after negotiations with local headquarters, have agreed to give continuous employment to those under the scheme.Institutional Training, Numerous applications continue to be received in the London and South-Eastern area. Local headquarters have so far been able to provide for most of them, though vacancies for daytime training in engineering appear to be scarce.General Training: Apprentices and Boys.Apprenticeship (Building). Reports upon the prospects of the national scheme continue favourable. As a rule the idea of local Apprenticeship Committees appears to be received with favour. The chairman of the Liverpool master builders considers machinery for selecting employers to be as necessary as for selecting apprentices, since many have no facilities for proper training. The secretary of the Bury master builders attributes the shortage of skilled labour to past refusals by employers to take sufficient apprentices. At Derby, the master builders are, on the whole, prepared to adopt the wage scale of the national scheme, though it is higher than existing local rates. The local rates were considerably increased a short while ago, and the former acute shortage of apprentices appears to be mitigated appreciably. At Preston, employers are inclined to maintain that the fixing of boys&apos; wages is no concern of the operatives ; but this difficulty may not prove insuperable.Women&apos;s Training.Schemes Sanctioned. Sanction has been given to schemes for training in cookery and waiting at the Westminster Technical Institute. The classes are arranged on lines similar to those of successful courses previously held at this centre. The new classes will be attended both by registered unemployed women and by war widows.Schemes Closed. The Shrewsbury trouser-making class closed during September. All the trainees, except one, have remained in employment with the firm. They are only earning, on the average, 16s. per week, owing to the unusual slackness of orders, but the firm are continuing to pay them 24s., as during training, and hope to make good the loss when trade revives, as the trainees are proving very satisfactory workers.Training of War Widows. As a result of the widespread announcement in the Press of the final date, the 15th October, for applications for training, 819 fresh applications were received during the five weeks ending the 2nd October. In all, 1,100 cases still remain for decision.In ignorance of the facilities provided by the department, a number of widows have already independently entered on a course of training. Applications for assistance in such cases are now being received, which show that training was often undertaken under considerable hardship, money being borrowed to pay the fees. The payment of retro-spective grants had already been sanctioned by the Treasury, but was limited to cases in which application was made before the 31st March. Discretionary power to waive this limitation, where desirable, has now been sanctioned, with the substitution of the 15th October as the closing date.Treasury sanction has also been given to an arrangement whereby a supplementary grant may be made by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment in cases where the maximum grant payable is not adequate to cover the total cost of training. The need for this is only likely to arise in exceptional cases of professional and semi-professional training.Disabled Nurses. During September, 16 fresh applications were made for assistance in training, the courses asked for being for child welfare, medical electricity and Swedish remedial exercises, medical electricity and radiography, embroidery, health visiting and secretarial work. Sanction for training was given in nine cases. Six nurses in training have broken down in health owing to an acute return of disability, and the continuance of their course is indefinitely postponed. Three others were found to be physically unfit to begin any training at present.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 461, 465, 466; 470, 472 and 473.]
INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : REPORTS.Building-The Painters&apos; and Decorators&apos; Council, now recognised by the Building Industrial Council as a Sub-Council, met on the 7th October. Several technical and craft questions were considered, including objections to the use of wood preservative in place of paint on State-aided houses, and the stripping of wallpapers before redecoration. On the former question it was decided that the Council did not approve of the reply of the Ministry of Health, suggesting that the local authorities should take action. An interview is to be sought with the Ministry of Health on both matters. Should the Ministry of Health not satisfy the Council, it is proposed to recommend the constituent bodies to take whatever action seems necessary. A sub-committee reported in favour of a scheme for the registra-tion of master painters. The report was referred back for the consideration of points of difficulty.The Resettlement Committee met Dr. Addison and the principal housing officers of the Ministry of Health, on the 6th October, and continued the negotiations in regard to pay-ment for time lost through stress of weather. Reports had been received by the Ministry of Health from the operatives&apos; and employers&apos; organisations respectively, which stated that the employers were prepared to recommend payment for time lost through such cause at the rate of 50 per cent, of the standard rate, and that the operatives were unable to accept less than 75 per cent. Dr. Addison suggested that, assuming a 44-hour week basis, payment for the first 22 hours lost should be at the rate of 50 per cent, and for any time in excess of 22 hours at the rate of 75 per cent. It was found impossible to arrive at an agreement, owing to the employers&apos; refusal to recommend any additional concession. Dr. Addison stated that he proposed to apply his proposal, as stated above, to all trades engaged on housing work which accepted and worked the committee&apos;s adult apprenticeship scheme, and that he relied upon the representatives of both sides to assist his department in ensuring that this order will be carried into effect.Carpets. The adjourned annual meeting of the Council was held on the 30th September. Mr. Lindsay, a Scottish trade union representative, was elected chairman in place of Sir Herbert Smith. The operatives presented a demand for a further increase in wages from the expiry of the present agreement on the 30th September. The employers were unable to grant any increase at the meeting, but are considering the proposals. It was arranged to continue the old agreement pending a settlement. No progress Was reported by the committee set up to consider the standardisation of wages. At an interview on the 7th October, Mr. Crowther, secretary of the trade union side of the Council, stated that stan-dardisation is dead. Mr. Crowther further stated that negotiations were proceeding between the Scottish employers and trade unionists with a view to arriving at a satisfactory basis for the return of the Scottish employers to the Council. The way should now be clear for the return of the Scottish employers, the main reason for their withdrawal being opposition to standardisation.Electricity Supply. A conference of representatives of the Joint Industrial Council for Local Authorities, Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services, and of the National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members, Electricity Supply Industry, was held on the 6th October to consider the overlapping of the interests of the two bodies, affecting the staffs of municipal electricity undertakings. A joint committee was appointed to explore the ground with a view to finding a solution. The District Council for the East Coast Area met on the 7th October. It was reported that the undertakings in the area approved the action which the employers&apos; side had taken at the previous meeting in refusing to accept the schedule of basic rates submitted by the joint sub-committee. The employers again declined to agree to any increases above existing rates of pay, but suggested that the question be referred to the National Council for settlement, and gave an assurance that the award of the National Council, if necessitating-&apos;any Wage adjustments, should be recom-mended for adoption to the undertakings in the area. The Council agreed that the matter be referred to the National Council. The District Council for the East Midlands Area met
on the 7th October.

He seemed confident that, if such a meeting took place, the opponents of amalgamation would be defeated. He confirmed the opinion of the president of the Birmingham employers&apos; asso-ciation that the position would be considerably eased if the Birmingham union would take some steps to ascertain the opinion of their members as to amalgamation with the national union.Heating and Domestic Engineering. The Education Committee, on the 4th October, decided that the trade union branches throughout the country should be asked to find out how many men in their districts would be likely to attend the classes which, it is proposed, should be set up in conjunction with the Board of Education by the Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers. The Emergency Committee met later, and discussed the question of payment by results, which they referred to the Council for further consideration. The Council met on the 5th October and, after a long discussion on this subject, it was decided&quot;&apos;to describe any proposed payments as &quot;additional payments, over and above time-rates, by results.&quot; On the basis of this new understanding, the operatives asked the employers to draw up a skeleton scheme which they might submit to a ballot of their members, if approved by the union executive. A scheme for a Central Holiday Fund, put forward by the operatives, was favourably received by the employers. The scheme, which proposes that an operative should contribute each week, towards his week&apos;s annual holiday, a sum equal to his hourly rate of pay, to which the employer should add the same amount, is to be referred to the CounciPs constituent associations. The Council decided to invite a representative of the Juvenile Branch to attend the next meeting of the Education Committee.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).

It was resolved to request the MiniBter to confirm the minimum rates as now fixed, and that they should become effective as from the 1st November.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Administrative Committee appointed a sub-committee, consisting of one appointed member, one representative of employers, and one representative of workers, to draft schemes of apprenticeship for male and female apprentices, and suggested, for the consideration of the sub-committee, certain general minimum time-rates for female apprentices. The committee also referred to the sub-committee the question of the rates to be applicable to learners excluded from the operation of the rules fixed for female workers, and also the question of the desirability of making any adjustment in the rates at present fixed for female learners. The com-mittee agreed to recommend that for insurance purposes, the units of work should be fixed for outworkers in the tailoring trade at 50s. for male workers and 30s. for female workers. It was also agreed to recommend to the Board that the present form of application for permits of exemption should be amended. The committee nominated an additional representative to attend the deputation to be received by the Minister in connection with the future administration of the Trade Boards Acts. They also considered a letter from the Ministry with regard to the extension of the scope of the Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing Trade Boards, and resolved by a majority to recommend to the Board that, in their opinion, no case had been established for any alteration in the present scope of the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain).The committee also considered certain questions of scope referred to the Board by the Minister, and agreed to make recommendations to the Board.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain).&apos; The Cigar Committee agreed to recommend the Board to establish a system of indentured apprenticeship; in lieu of the learnership system in operation for learners to hand or mould cigar making, and to fix minimum rates of wages for apprentices in the cigar section.Flax and Hemp Trade Board (Great Britain).

The Units of Work (Weavers) Committee were unable to reach a decision as to the practicability of establishing units of work with graduated scales for weavers ; but recommended that the Units&apos; of Work Committee be continued ; and that, pending a decision by the committee, no attempt be made to alter existing practices. The Special Rates Committee decided to recommend the Board to fix a piece-work basis time-rate of 9d. per hour for weaving mistresses.A draft scheme of apprenticeship for male workers was adopted, and the preparation of a form of indenture was referred to the Apprenticeship Sub-Committee.

A dispute between the Amalgamated National Union of Quarry-workers and Settmakers and the National Union of Dock and Riverside and General Workers has occurred at the quarries of the Penmaenmawr &amp; Welsh Granite Co., Ltd. A new working agreement had been negotiated between the employers and the quarry-workers&apos; union in April, to which the dockers&apos; union asked to become a party, claiming that the agreement affected a large number of their members in the district. This request was refused. The secretary of the quarry-workers&apos; union complained that members of that organisation, employed as quarry-workers, had been induced by the organiser of the dockers&apos; union to transfer their membership to the latter society. These complaints were inquired into by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, who found the complaint proved, and recommended that the men should return to the union to which they belonged. The dockers&apos; union withdrew their men working, in the quarries on the 24th July and placed an embargo upon the loading and unloading of vessels at Penmaenmawr.At the request of the National Federation of Granite and Roadstone Quarry Owners the department intervened, and a meeting of the federation, the employers, representatives of the two unions, and the secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, was held on the 24th August. It was agreed &quot; that the decision of the Parliamen-tary Committee be frankly accepted and acted upon, by the men who were members of the National Union employed at this quarry at once transferring their membership to the Amalgamated National Union of Quarry-workers and Settmakers. Also that work be resumed on the 27th August by all workers.&quot;On the resumption of work, the trouble broke out afresh, owing to a disinclination on the part of the officials of the dockers&apos; union to aid in carrying out the agreed settle-ment unless the firm first paid the retrospective advances to their members. Arrangements were made for the back money to be paid not later than the 18th September, and the officials of the dockers&apos; union thereupon undertook to influence their members to transfer to the quarry-workers&apos; union in accordance with the decision of the Parliamentary Committee.Paviors&apos; Labourers [Leicester),paviors&apos; labourers in the tramway department made an application in June for the local building trade rate, 2s. Id. per hour, in place of their rate of Is. Id. per hour, as all the other paviors and paviors&apos; labourers in the Corpora-tion&apos;s employment receive the building trade rate. The application was refused, and on the 21st August, seven days&apos; notice to cease work was given. Through the intervention of the Chief Conciliation Officer the notices were suspended until after a&apos;full meeting of the tramways committee on the 9th September, when it was decided to recommend to the Council that the paviors&apos; labourers should be paid building trade rates, upon the clear understanding that the hours and weather conditions prevailing in the building trade must apply to these men also. The City Council on the 28th September adopted the recommendation.COMMITTEES, CONFERENCES AND DEPUTATIONS.Mersey Ship Repair Trade. At the meeting on the 7th October, the employers&apos; attitude was that they were not prepared to give an increase of wages above those which are settled nationally. The executive of the union know this. The fact that the employers have given notice to withdraw, as from the end of November, the 12s. advance conceded to joiners, does not alter the fact that the joiners enjoyed the concession during the interim period. Apparently one of the local difficulties is thafrthe shipwrights in Liverpool used to belong to an independent union, and to negotiate their settlements locally. They are apprehensive that their amalgamation may restrict their influence as to their own con-ditions.  The employers were pressed to recognise the force of this point and to agree to

The employers are to consider the question, and to inform the department when they can agree to such a meeting.Road Transport Industry. A joint conference of the employers&apos; federations and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation was held on the 8th October, in connection with the men&apos;s national wages claim. The claim was not discussed, as the employers&apos; representatives had not been empowered to do so. They undertook, however, to call meetings of their members within the next ten days, to see if they would agree to a conference of the parties formerly represented on the Joint Industrial Council for the industry. It is proposed, provisionally, to convene such a conference for the 19th October to discuss the claim.QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.Women in Bakeries (Glasgow). As the result of the endeavours of the Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, the Scottish Union of Bakers and Confectioners intimated that only two firms would be involved in the threatened strike of bakers in Glasgow to secure the abolition of female labour in the bakehouses. Following further meetings of the union executive and of the employers&apos; association, on the 3rd October, the union were persuaded to agree that satisfactory arrangements had been made in the case of one firm, and that it would not be wise to take drastic action in.the remaining case. It is understood that about 80 women have been dismissed from the Glasgow bakeries as a result of the arrangement to return to pre-war conditions. Efforts were made to arrange an interview between representative women and the executive of the union, but the union stated that they could not see that any good purpose would be served by such a meeting and the idea was abandoned. The women have decided that, where union members are candidates for seats on the Glasgow Corporation at the next election, women candidates shall be nominated expressly to oppose them.Woollen Workers (West Wales).-A joint conference* was held at Carmarthen on the 5th October, at which it was made clear that the employers are willing to end the lock-out if the men on strike at Cwerchyr will return to work. The union officials undertook to endeavour to secure a resumption of work, but were doubtful if they could do so. A meetingTof the men was fixed for the 8th October. Should a resumption of work be secured, the wh*)le question of the dispute will be reconsidered at a fuller joint conference at Aberystwyth, on the 20th October.Blastfurnacemen: Notice in Case of Strike. The Scottish Ironmasters&apos; Association have been informed that the Minister is aware of the difficulties that have arisen,f and that he has, for some time, been in communication with the Ministry of Munitions with the object of securing a repeal of the section of the Munitions of War Act complained of; that a Bill for this purpose is now in draft form, and that it is intended to take an early opportunity of introducing it in Parliament. They have been further informed that the Minister has been advised that he has no authority to give an assurance that, in the event of a firm continuing to work on the daily contract system, they will not be subjected to a claim under the Munitions of War Acts for a week&apos;s wages, and it has been suggested that the association should consider the advisability of taking the matter up with he blastfurnacemen&apos;s union with a view to coming to some arrangement to meet the difficulty.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration will be found also on pages 454 to 460, 461 and 469 to 474.]
