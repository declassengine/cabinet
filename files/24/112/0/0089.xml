While they have been accorded courteous treatment under orders fron Kabul, the advent of the ;ri3Sion is apparently unpopular with the Heral authorities.The Indian Government has decided to; take measures against the Wano Wazirs.    Before, however, taking punitive measures the latter are to be summoned to a Jirgaat which they will be presented with our;terms.&apos;   Should they&quot;not comply with the terns within a reasonable period punitive measures will have to be undertaken.SOUTH AFRICA.H.R.H. Prince Arthur of Connaught will leave London on Friday October 29th to take up his position as Governor-General and Oommander-in-Chief of the Union of South Africa.EGYPT.The Suez Canal Company*s employees at Port Said are still agitating for better conditions.    The chief.of their present demands is for 50,  increase in lower grade salaries and a revision      the rules affecting dismissal of staff.? MESOPOTAMIA.Samawah garrison have been relieved (on the 14th).. They are well on the whole and have few sick .     Another aeroplane which went out on reconnaissance has not returned but the airmen who were captured by the insurgents at Flfl have been released and have rejoined, our advance column.The Mesopotamian situation is slightly improved and the Columns from the north and south are converging towards e&apos;^ch other.PERSIA.There has been practically no news from Persia, beyond &amp; report that a Vessel bombarded Bander-i-Gez and then steamed off to the northward.The High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, Sir Percy Cox, arrived at Baghdad on the 11th and. had an enthusiastic reception.SOVIET RUSSIA.
SOVIET   RUSSIA..North. Russia.Moscow reports 12th October that/ an exploring expedition under Engineer Nalivaiks has returned to Archangel after an extensive survey of the Petchora River.General.Chiohorin states that the Russian internal policy is now one of conciliation.    This view Is probably corrett, beoause, although nwch dissatisfaction certainly exists, there is nothing to renlaoe the Soviets,    Desertion in the &quot;Bolshevik Array is reported to have reached colossal dimensions.Latvia.The Lettish-Lithuanian frontier Convention has been ratified by both Parliaments,    Execution, however, is complicated by the White Russian advance northwards from Vilna and&apos;by the new Polish corridor.Lithuania.Vilna was occupied at 5 p,m. on 9th Ootober by troops under General Zeligowsky in defiance of the orders of the Polish Authorities.    Zeligowsky has set up a provisional government.    The League of Nations has taken a serious view of the position, especially as they had been asked, to arbitrate between Lithuania and Poland with regard, to frontier settlement, lighting: is reported to have ta^en place on 13th October N.W. of Vilna where the Poles attached the Lithuanians and occupied Swenziany and Bras law.    ^ood supplies may last a fortnight and if Poland refuses to provide -purther supplies, this irregular force will probably march o?i Fovno and attempt to overrun Lithuania;   should Lithuanian troops attack, it is certain that further unauthorised Polish aid for the irregular force will be forthcoming.    Pilsudski is reported to have resigned as Head of the Polish State in order to thro-- in his loi with the Vilna adventurers, being himself a native of that town.    All Missions returned to Zovno from Vilna on 13th Ootober.CAUCASIA.Azerbaijan.The French Government has instructed the French Consul at Tiflis to negotiate with Soviet and Azerbaijan Representatives regarding the release of French prisoners at Baku.     In the Soviet reof l^th October to the British Note of 9th October it is stated that the Soviet Government have instructed their representative at Tiflis to deal ^Ith the question of the repatriation of the British Ba^u prisoners on the lines agreed to by Lord   Ourzon In his Note of 9th October.POLAND.
POLAND.8.An Armistice and preliminary peace Treaty between Poland and Soviet Russia was signed on the 12th.The conditions are not yet to hand but it is understoo Poland will acquire a &quot;Corridor&quot; to Dvinsk running along the lithuania anian-Ru s si an Front ier *General Zeligov/ski resigned his commission as a Polish general, and with a well equipped army of 15,000 men, has seized Vilna the ancient capital of historical Lithuania and set up a provisional Government.    The ^polish Government describe 3eligowski*s action as mutinous but. do not renounce their rights to Vilna.    There are Indications that Pilsudski the chief of the state might resign, his office and join General Zeligowskl.    The French and British representatives at Warsaw have been directed to obtain a less ambiguous disavowal of Zeligows&amp;i&apos;s aotion.    T^e League of Nations will, it is understood, demand renar^tion for the way in which their authority has been flouted.The ohie-0 of the state, Pilsudski, has informed the Y/hite Russian armies, consisting of *bout 30,000 men, who were serving with the T^oles^ that t^ey must be east op the Armistice line six days after t^e signature of the Armistice and preliminary peace.AUSTRIA.The National Constituent Assembly has ended its career by passing the constitution.The Assembly passed a resolu+lon to hold within 6 months a plebiscite on the question of union with Germany. It appears that the League of Nations will be appealed to to revise the Peaoe Treaty in this respect.The plebiscite in zone A of the Klagenfurt area has gone in favour of Austria.     Jugo-Slav troops have begun to re-occupy this area from which they had been ordered to withdraw.The Conference of Ambassadors has requested the Jugo-Slav Government to recall their troops without delay.WGARY.Hungary is being urged to ratify the Peace Treaty by Not? ember 1st.ITALY.A report has been received which indicates that under the regime of d*Annunzio Fiume is likely to become a head-quarters of illicit Arms Traffic to the East.&apos;    BULGARIA.The Labour Communes of Bulgaria are reported to maintain open commando actions with Soviet Russia through the port of Varna, and propaganda pamphlets are imported in great bulk by that way.GREECE.
GgggOg .The possibility of f*.e death of the Fing of Greece is causing much anxiety to M. Venizelos and his Cabinet.     In view the difficulties surrounding the question of a successor.The ex-Ting and his eldest son are definitely excluded from the succession, and it renains to &quot;be seen whether one of the younger sons would consent to give such guarantees as would alloy; M. Venizelos (who does not think Greece yet ripe for a Republic) to agree to his ascending the thi?one.Meanwhile a Regency under &quot;Admiral Condouriotis is spoken of.TURKEY.. The High. Commissioner, Constantinople, reports that there is no prospect of Turkey ratifying the Treaty in the near future unless foroe is used.The High Commissioners were received in audience by the Sultan on the 11th inst. when the French High Commissioner suggested definitely to His Majesty that a change of Government would be desirable.    Admiral de Robeok confined himself to pointing out that Damad Ferid Pasha was regarded in some quarters as a serious personal obstacle to the success of the Mission of conciliation which it is proposed to send to Asia Minor.It is expected that Sir Horace Rumbold, late British Minister at Warsaw, will relieve Admiral de Robeck as High Commissioner about the 15th November.ARMENIA.The nationalist foroes advancing on Kara from the westward have occupied Merdonek on the Clti-KarS road, and Novo Selim, on fhe Sarakamish-Kars road.

On that date the railway strike still continued, but the Government had increased the trail service and the menappeared to be gradually returning to work. No serious disorders h^d occurred.Cape Verde Islands..The press reports that the economic situation in the Cape Verde Islands is extremely grave, the bulk of the population is said to be a prey to famine.SYRIA.
SYRIA10.Oilioia.A report received f&quot;oom one who left Mersina on September 27th, confirms last week;s reports    The whole Armenian population of Cilicia was then concentrated in the towns, the majority in Adana, which was isolated and surrounded by Nationalists.     Irregular railway communication was still being maintained between Mersina and Tarsus.    Hadjin was still besieged, but in no immediate peril,    Marash and Aintab had not been re-occupied by the French.     About the middle of September the French are said to have proposed to evacuate some 14,000 Armenian refugees encamped near Adana, preparatory to the re-establishment there of fugitive Turks.    On the refusal of the Armenians, the French appear to have out off supplies, which have since been provided by Armenian Committees of Relief.TffiXIOO.Felix Diaz, the nephew of the renowned President hasbeen bapturad and is to he exiled.The country is now reported to be completelypacified.CHILE.Sr. Don Arturo Alessandri has been elected President of Chile for the period l99,0-25.So close was the election contest with his rival for offioe, Sr. Barros Borg-ono, that recourse was had to arbitration by a special oourt, which eventually decided in favour of Sr. Alessandri.The President-elect represents the advanced Radical section in Chilean politics.2QS&amp;*Reports from South China, are confined to those in the press and are conflicting.    Those received up to the 15th October Indicated that the party friendly to that established in Peking had been driven from power.    The only reports since that date indicate the reverse.
