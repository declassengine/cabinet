this document is the property of his britannicI -I I. umajesty1s government.out-of-work donation- ex-service mbh. EC ret.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,.P.1903. ^The Cabinet will remember that a third extension of Out-of-ftork Donation for ex-Service men was authorised for eieht weeks at  1 a week, without allowances for children, to be drawn during the 14 weeks from the 1st August to the 8th November.    Eight consecutive weeks since the 1st August expired on Saturday last; and it appears that roughly about 6,000 men exhausted their eight weeks * donation on Saturday last - having drawn the donation without intermission.     It appears further that the donation of another 8,500 will expire by the end of this weeks     It appears still further that thereafter the number of men exhausting their right to donation will be about 8,000 during next,week, and 5,000 weekly thereafter.Strong representations have been made to me respecting the very great hardship which is be in/? and will be experienced by these men, who will be without any means of subsistence whatever between now and the time when the various schemes for the employment of ex-Servj.ce men now being: considered by the Housing Committee and the Unemployment Committee of the Cabinet may be expected to become operative,I have this afternoon discussed the matter very carefully with my advisers, and there Is general agreement in the view that it is not only Just but extremely desirable that the next few weeks should not be faced with a growing/number
number of these men destitute.     It must not be forgotten that the fall in employment which has been In certain districts and trades rather seriously marked during the last three or four weeks, does very much increase the difficulty with which these men are confronted in their endeavour to find work.      They accept in good faith the statement that the Government is doing its best to devise schemes through the medium of the Building Trades and otherwise to find employment for large numbers of them. But they ask that they may be saved from destitution during the intervening period.      There is of course the Poor Law,     But in my Judgment, we cannot, send, neither would public opinion support us in sending, the soldier to the Poor Law.      i therefore ask authority to announce that the sight weeks of the third extension be extended by a further six weeks to be drawn not later than the 8th November.According to the best estimate that can be made the additional cost of this proposal to the Exchequer will not exceed  850,000, and may very probably be not more than  &apos;  200,000.(Signed) T. J. MAC NAMARA.Ministry of Labour. 29th September, 1920.
