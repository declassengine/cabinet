Wher such r-storation is impossible, full compensation should be given.The wholesale repudiation of her debt, and the conical denial of the rights of individuals, have outlawed Russia from the comity of honest traders; and we consider that to resume trade with her until she has purged herself of this reproach would tend to lower the whole standard of commercial morality.   It would be interpreted as a tacit condonation by this country of the Soviet?s repudiation of Russia&apos;s liabilities, and could not but produce a disastrous impression, both at homo and abroad.   To sua est that these questions can be left to the conclusion of peace with Russia, would be a fatal error,   Russia will go a long way at this moment in order to obtain a commercial Agreement - once tbat ts granted, the only chance of obtaining
jus-tic6&quot;-for**t;he British Bondholder has vanished.v/e venture to remind you that the invitation, sent out by the Btoreign Office in 1918 to the holders of Russian property, or securities, to register the same &quot;-ith the   oreign Claims Department of the Foreign Office, has been univer ally accepted in the City as a promise of protection, which we trust the Government will not withhold.The undersigned represent primarily large Insurance Companies, who are holders of Russian Government securities, but similar views have already been, put before you by the leading Bankers and merchants of the City.&apos;7e should add that the recognition of debt that v;e ask for need not preclude Russia from submitting such a scheme for eventual settlement as may be possible under the circumstances.We have the honour to wain,Faithfully yours,Evelyn Hubbard - Chairman Guardian Assurance Co.,Ltd.,Henry tf.Oardiner - Deputy Chairman, The Atlas AssuranceCo.,Ltd.,C,.:.,S.Guthrie - Sub-Governor, The London Assurance Co.V.H.Smith - Governor, the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation.E.R,Ctoen, - Chairman, Commercial Union Assurance Co.Ltd.
