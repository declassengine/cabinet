PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey oi the Week.The decision of the delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, on the 1st October, to submit to a ballot vote of members the owners&apos; revised datum line offer, marked the end of the second crisis in the coal situation. The expiry of the miners&apos; strike notices had already been postponed to the 2nd October, and, as a result of this decision, a further suspension has taken place until the 16th October. The result of the ballot vote will be known on the 13th, and upon this will depend the further development of the situation. Much discussion has taken place in the last few days upon the question of whether a two-thirds majority will be necessary for a strike, or whether the mere rejection of the owners&apos; offer will suffice. The rules of the Federation do &apos;not deal with this point, and the national delegate conference have full power to interpret the wishes of the members as recorded in the ballot vote. It is noteworthy that the ballot paper only allows the miners to choose between the two alternatives of a strike or the acceptance of the datum line proposal. Those members of the Federation, therefore, who would prefer their wages demand to be referred to an impartial tribunal have no opportunity of recording this opinion. The miners&apos; demand for a reduction in the selling price of household coal appears to have been definitely abandoned. The cross currents of opinions and interests within the Federation as a whole, and within each of its constituent bodies, are many and complicated. The national delegate conference decided to hold a second ballot by a comparatively narrow majority ; and the duty oi recommending members how to vote has been left to the representative bodies of the constituent organisations, whose varying opinions are given below.Among other developments of the industrial position in the week, attention may be drawn to the national agreement in the engineering industry with regard to overtime and night work. In the cotton textile industry the proposed short-time working, which will affect the wages earned by nearly the whole of the employees in the spinning section, overshadows the piecers&apos; dispute, which still lingers. The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks are beginning another campaign on behalf of their members in London, and are adhering to their policy of endeavouring to secure a joint reference of their claims to the Industrial Court. The road transport position remains unsettled; but a meeting between representatives of the employers and employed has been arranged for the 8th October.So far as can be judged at the moment, it does not appear that the expiry of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, as continued by the Industrial Courts Act, will be followed by any general movement on the part of employers to reduce wages in those occupations which are now unprotected. Only moderate attention has been paid to this event by the Press, and it is reported that in some quarters misapprehension has existed with regard to the effect of the expiry upon the continuance of the Industrial Court. The Minister received on the 5th October a deputation of trade union leaders, who feared that the economic position of women workers would be seriously prejudiced by the expiry of these Acts; an account of the proceedings is given below.Attention has again been drawn in the course of the week to the unemployment position, but Coventry has taken the place of London as the centre of interest. Local government authorities in many parts of the country are considering the question of expediting public works in order to relieve in some measure the distress that may occur in the winter. Many newspapers have given considerable prominence to the official announcement that the price of bread and flour to the retail consumer will be increased on and after the 17th October, and the Governments policy with regard to the bread subsidy has called forth protests from the London Labour Conference attached to the Ministry of Food.The Labour movement in its political aspects is becoming more active. Local Labour Parties are making active preparations for the municipal elections, which take place on the 1st November,  The publication, on the 29th September, of a letter signed by
The General Situation-continued.M. Edo Fimmen, joint secretary of the International Federation of Trade Unions, and secre-tary of the International Federation of Transport Workers, which called attention to the con-tinuecl transport of munitions to Poland, has been followed by the decision of the National Council of Action to call, on the 18th October, a joint meeting of the Parliamentary Com-mittee of the Trade Union Congress, the Executive of the Labour Party, and the Parlia-mentary Labour Party, at which future policy will be decided. The Council have asked local bodies to organise public demonstrations on the 17th October to demand peace with Russia and the re-opening of trade relations with that country.The Government have decided to allow an additional six weeks&apos; out-of-work donation to be drawn under the special extension scheme for ex-Service men and women, which became operative on the 2nd August, thus making it possible for 14 weeks&apos; donation in all to be drawn. The scheme will terminate on the 6th November, and, on the 8th November, the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, will come into operation.The report of the Departmental Committee appointed by the Home Secretary to consider the grant of a bonus to the police in view of the increased cost of living has been, accepted, and increased rates of pay for all ranks of the police force will ensue.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 24th September was 158,759, made up of 158,217 lodged by men and 542 by women. On the 17th September there were 154,763 policies current, 154,203 for men and 553 for women.On the 24th September 103,075 unemployment books, 71,263 for males and 31,812 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Corn-pared with the previous week, when there were 69,127 books lodged by males and 30,456 by females, the total increase is 3,492.The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 438.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Ireland. The position of the expelled workers in Belfast remains unchanged. The employees of Messrs. Workman, Clark &amp; Co., Ltd., have passed a resolution similar to that already adopted by the workers in the yards of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Ltd., declaring that they are prepared to work with any loyal man irrespective of religion.With regard to the action of the executive committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners in issuing strike notices withdrawing all their members from the workshops and yards involved, only a minority, estimated at 500, have obeyed the direction to cease work. It is stated that those members of the society who have remained at work will take legal advice as to the validity of the order of their executive, and of the threat that all members who refuse to obey will be expelled from the society. It is reported that the Coleraine branch of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners are supporting the Belfast members of the society in their action against the executive.Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, 1918-19. On the 5th October, the Minister received a deputation, representing the National Federation of Women Workers and other unions, to discuss the present position of women workers in view of the fact that the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, as extended by the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, expired on the 30th September. The deputation was introduced by the Right Hon. J. R. Clynes, M.P., and the principal speakers were Miss Symons, of the National Federation of Women Workers, and Mr. E. Bevin, of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union. The speakers stated that there were between one and two million women workers who were not yet protected by Trade Boards, or by Joint Industrial Councils, but whose interests had hitherto been safeguarded by the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, and they asked that fresh legislation might be introduced at an early date to continue the(B 16515) 3 K 2
* See p, 434 below.protection hitherto given to these women, until such time as they came within the juris-diction of Trade Boards. It was also urged that these women needed protection at the present time even more than had been the case in November, 1918, and November, 1919, owing to the ever-increasing cost of living and to the serious increase in unemployment, and it was alleged that some cases had already occurred where employers were attempting to reduce the wages of their women employees. The Minister promised to give careful consideration to the points put before him, to ascertain the views of representative employers, and to communicate further with the deputation.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. A joint conference between representatives of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Management Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions, and the Committee of the National Conference of Friendly Societies, was held in London on the 29th September, under the chairmanship of Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P. The representatives of the friendly societies submitted the scheme approved by the National Conference of Friendly Societies at Coventry.* They emphasised the advantage of administering the Act through a national organisation repre-senting all types of working-class organisations. The trade union representatives, however, declined to enter into any arrangement for joint administration, on the ground that unemployment insurance was peculiarly the work of trade unions, and altogether outside the function of friendly societies. The conference thus failed ; and the friendly societies, together with other approved societies, will proceed with the scheme for a national organisa-tion for the administration of the Act, adopted by the Coventry conference.Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. The progress of the agita-tion in Scotland against the provisions of this Act, which allowed increases in rent, was reviewed by a conference of the Scottish Labour Housing Association in Glasgow on the 2nd October. After a long discussion, a resolution was carried expressing appreciation of the courageous attitude of tenants in every district concerned, and gratitude for the response to the call for a demonstration strike on the 25th August, but recording the opinion of the conference that the support accorded to the rent strike had not been suffi-ciently general to warrant the Association advising the people to continue to refuse the payment of increased rents. The conference determined to try to obtain the repeal of the obnoxious clauses in the Act, and, in the meantime, to see that full advantage is taken by tenants of the provisions of the Act with regard to insanitary houses.This resolution may be taken as marking the end of organised resistance to the Act in Scotland and the North-East of England. The Scottish Labour Housing Association have now adopted the alternative policy, of taking what action they can to see that tenants take full advantage of the many privileges conferred upon them by the Act. This latter policy has from the first been recommended by the Labour Party organisations in England.Canal Boats Acts. The Minister of Health has appointed a departmental committee to inquire into the practice of living-in on canal boats, and to report whether any altera-. tion in the practice is desirable. The members of the committee are Mr. Neville Cham-berlain, M.P., chairman ; Mrs. E. Barton, of the Sheffield City Council and the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild; Mr. 0. J. Llewellyn, Inspector under the Canal Boats Acts ; Mr. T. McKerrell, of the Ministry of Labour ; Mr. H. J. R. Murray, H.M. Inspector of Schools ; Mr. Sidney Preston, C.I.E., C.B.E., of the Ministry of Transport; and Dame Louise Gilbert Samuel, D.B.E., of the Chelsea Borough Council. Mr. A. Jones, of the Ministry of Health, is secretary.Unemployment (Coventry). Movements of particular interest among the unemployed in Coventry have been reported during the week. Agitation among the unemployed has been taken up by the extreme section, and the National Union of Ex-Service Men and a local &quot; Workers&apos; Council&quot; have been prominent. Demonstrations have taken place outside some of the principal works of the city. So far, they appear to have been of a remarkably peaceful nature. Attention may be drawn to two features of the situation. Firstly, there has been an attempt to exclude from participation in the agitation the local trade union officials and Labour representatives on the City Council. Secondly, recent events in the North of Italy, which have been extensively reported in the Press, have provided the. agitators with an example and a precedent.   At a Town&apos;s Meeting
on the 4th October, the committee who are organising the unemployed secured the adop-tion of three resolutions, as follows that the civic authorities, with representatives of the Workers&apos; Council, shall invite the Russian trade delegation to meet them in order to find what commodities Russia is prepared to purchase from us.That factories be taken, in the interests of the community, to produce its commodities, and that the workers in such factories shall elect their own management and foremen.That the civic authority shall pledge itself to use its power in preventing private interests of persons who may be opposed to this scheme from hindering the Workers&apos; Council in its work.It is reported that the local engineering works are to meet the present slackness in trade by working short time rather than by dismissing employees, and that within a few weeks the Corporation will be able to provide some employment by laying out a public park as a war memorial.The Mayor and the Town Clerk of Coventry interviewed the Minister on the 5th October.Cotton Textile Industry. In accordance with the decision taken on the 28th Sep-tember by the General Committee of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associa-tions, Ltd., that a meeting with representatives of the operatives&apos; organisations should be held to discuss the details of any curtailment of production, before the question was submitted to a ballot of the members of the Federation, meetings took place on the 1st and the 5th October between representatives of the Federation and of the three trade union organisations concerned, namely, the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners, the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives, and the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association. The proposal of the Federation is that the curtailment of production in the Egyptian and American cotton spinning sections should take the form of a week-end stoppage of work, on each Saturday and Mon-day, from the 23rd October to the .15th November. It is understood that the operatives&apos; representatives put forward a proposal for compensation to the operatives for the loss of wages which this measure would involve. The Federation, however, have refused to do anything in this direction, and, in these circumstances, the operatives&apos; representatives have intimated that they cannot recommend their members to become parties to any system of short-time working. The proposal of the Federation will be submitted to a ballot vote of the employers, and will be put into operation in each section, should firms owning 80 per cent, of the spindles affected prove willing to adopt the scheme. The effect of the scheme will be a stoppage of 52 hours in the period named. Those firms &apos;who are manufacturers as well as spinners will only be required to stop their mills for 26 hours.University of Wales. The Charter recently granted to the University College of Swansea, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Wales, provides for the direct representation of local labour bodies on the Court of Governors. The Trades Councils or Labour Associations of Swansea and district, and Llanelly and district, are each allowed to nominate two representatives, and the Trades Councils or Labour Associations of Neath and district, and Port Talbot and district, are each allowed to nominate one representative. Dr. Silby, the principal of the College, recently met delegates of the local Trades and Labour Councils, and placed before them the aims and purpose of the University. He also appealed to workers in the district to interest themselves in the College, to render tangible support, and to take their part in the work of educational development.Industrial Organisations.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. A special delegate conference of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation was held in London on the 6th October to discuss the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and the policy to be adopted by the various constituent unions of the Federation. The position of dockers and sea-farers was considered separately from that of the other occupations covered by the Federation. With regard to the dockers, it was agreed to press forward the scheme prepared by Mr. Bevin for the maintenance of dock workers during unemployment and under-employment.* Under this scheme it is proposed to meet the cost of maintenance by a tonnage levy upon goods handled, and if an agreement can be reached with the National Council of Port Labour Employers to put the scheme into operation, it is hoped that it may be possible for the dockers then to contract out of the Unemployment Insurance* An account of Mr. Bevin&apos;s scheme was given in this Report, Vol. ii, No. 9, 25th September, p. 383.
Act. With regard to seafarers, it was decided to recommend the three unions organising seafaring workers to consult with the executive committee of the Federation in order to set up a special scheme for these sections. With regard to the other occupations covered by the Federation, it was agreed to recommend the unions concerned to prepare schemes to supplement the unemployment benefit provided under the Act, in order that these unions might be allowed to join in the administration of the Act. It is reported that several unions estimate that, in those sections where unemployment is not generally prevalent or widespread, an additional weekly contribution of 2d. over and above the normal trade union contribution will provide an additional benefit of 6s. per week, and weekly contributions of id. and Qd. proportionately increased benefits.National Conference of Friendly Societies. The annual meeting of this Conference was held at Coventry on the 23rd and 24th September. The executive presented a draft scheme by which friendly and other approved societies might take part in the administration of unemployment insurance under section 17 of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act, 1920. The scheme provides for the establishment of a central organisation of all friendly and approved societies desirous of administering unemployment insurance. The organisation is to be governed by a committee of not more than 21 members provisionally nominated by the associations initiating the scheme, i.e., 8 by the National Conference of Friendly Societies, 4 by the Joint Committee of Approved Societies, 4 by the Association of Approved Societies, and the remainder by any other group of societies joining in the scheme. This committee will appoint in large or&apos; thickly populated areas employment officers, whose duty it will be to keep records respecting wages and conditions of unemployment, to arrange for the registering of vacant situations and particulars relating to unemployed members in the area, and to bring such members into contact with employers. The affiliated societies will be required to charge their members a flat rate contribution of 4c?. a week for the provision of the necessary additional non-State benefit of 5s. per week and the cost of administration, and, so far as is practicable, the ordinary local machinery of the societies will be employed for the collection of contri-butions and the payment of benefits.An amendment to the scheme was carried so as to open membership of the central organisation to all societies, whether friendly, approved or otherwise, desirous of adminis-tering unemployment insurance. A considerable modification was made by the adoption of another amendment moved on behalf of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows, by which the affiliated societies or groups of societies forming the central organisation may retain the contributions and pay the benefits of their own members, provided that, if a de-efficiency is declared in the fund vested in the central organisation, all affiliated societies, whether carrying their own insurance risk or not, shall pay their proportionate share of any levy imposed to restore the fund to solvency.Industrial League and Council, and National Alliance of Employers and Employed.-On the 19th August last a joint conference of these two bodies passed a series of resolutions recommending early amalgamation. In the interim, the two executives were to form a provisional joint committee to carry on the work of the two bodies, and to take such steps as might be necessary to complete the scheme of amalgamation. Accordingly, on the 29th September, a joint meeting of the two executive committees was held, at which a sub-committee was appointed to arrange provisional details for the amalgamation. The Industrial League and Council are represented on the joint sub-committee by Sir William Peake Mason, Mr. Lee Murray, Mr. D. Bremmer, Mr. G. H. Roberts, M.P., Mr. Frank Smith, and Mr. David Gilmour ; and the National Alliance of Employers and Employed, by Sir Richard Vassar-Smith, Mr. E. Manville, M.P., Mr. Philip Lockhart, Mr. Arthur Pugh, Mr. J. Solomon Hill, and Mr. Dawtry.Trade Union Topics.Seamen&apos;s Unions-It is reported that the terms of the proposed amalgamation of the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union, the British Seafarers&apos; Union and the Hull Seamen&apos;s Union have now been arranged, and are being issued to branches in order that a ballot vote of the members concerned may be taken upon them. The ballot will open on the 18th October, and will continue for several months in order to give all members an opportunity to vote.Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. It is reported that a joint com-mittee, consisting of three representatives of this Federation, three of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and three of the National Federation of Foundry Unions, is to be
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives. On the expiry of the requisite four months&apos; notice, the application of the London and Southern Counties district of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives for 3s. per hour for skilled workers, and 2s. 9d. for labourers, came before the District Conciliation Board, by whom it was considered on the 5th October. The problem of the grading of various towns is involved in the wages question ; and this gave rise to considerable discussion. It was reported that a settlement had not been reached, and that it was probable that the claim would go before the National Conciliation Board.Goal Miners (National). The situation took a fresh turn on the 1st October, when the national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation, which was adjourned from the 30th September, decided to take a fresh ballot of their members ,on a revised proposal put before the Executive Committee earlier in the day at a conference with the Prime Minister and other representatives of the Government, together with representatives of the Mining Association of Great Britain. It was decided to postpone strike notices until the 16th October. The ballot on the employers&apos; new offer will be taken on the 11th and 12th, returns to be made by the 13th. The result of the ballot will be considered by a national delegate conference on the 14th. The decision to take a second ballot was carried, after discussion, by a card vote of 534,000 against 401,000, delegates from South Wales, Lancashire and Durham opposing the proposal.The text of the new ballot paper was issued on the 4th October. The men are asked to declare for or against the acceptance of the actual revised offer of the coal owners, and no recommendation has been made by the Federation. The offer, which is set out in full, shows that the owners, who originally suggested an annual output of 242,000,000 tons as the datum line, the realisation of which would give an immediate increase in pay of Is. per shift, rising to 2s. and 3s. at 250,000,000 and 260,000,000 tons respectively, have reduced their datum line to 240,000,000 tons, with further increments of Qd. per shift for each additional 4,000,000 tons, until 3s. is reached at 256,000,000. The ballot paper adds that &quot; the whole scheme is to come under review (if accepted now) at the end of December.&quot;formed to draft a scheme, for the reconstruction of the Federation ol Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. This has become necessary through the absorption into the Amal-gamated Engineering Union of so many unions affiliated to the Federation.National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades. The General Council of this organisa-tion have decided to place on the agenda of the annual meetings of the branches, for the consideration and decision of their members, a proposal that no member should apply for a situation without first notifying the district or branch secretary, and also the shop delegate or shop steward at the firm where such application is being made.Ex-Service Men.Small Holdings for Ex-Service Men-A circular issued by the Ministry of Agriculture shows that 7,416 men have been settled on small holdings, and provision has been made for about 7,460 others. There are, however, nearly 7,000 more approved applicants waiting for holdings, and fresh, applications are coming forward at the rate of 1,500 a month.The unexpected cost of land, with the necessary buildings and equipment, has upset the financial basis of the scheme ; and County Councils are urged to acquire only such land as will require the minimum of expenditure on cottages and farm equipment, or can be let without equipment. The list of applicants is to be weeded out, and the whole administration tightened up generally.Officers&apos; Association-After a meeting in Glasgow, addressed by Earl Haig, a Glasgow branch of this association has been formed. It is reported that the Ranker Officers&apos; Association have decided to approach the Officers&apos; Association with a view to affiliation.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.The division within the Miners&apos; Federation is reflected in the country. On the 2nd October, the delegate conference of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation passed a resolution recording their intention of voting against the datum line settlement, and supporting a strike for the 2s. increase. The special delegate conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, held at Cardiff on the same day, agreed to suspend strike notices, but the proposal was made that the Federation should refuse to participate in the second ballot, as a protest against the action of the National Executive in entering into negotiations on the principle of regulating wages by output. No definite resolution was passed, however, and the matter was deferred until the 6th for further consideration. On the 4th, the executive of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation issued a manifesto urging their members to vote solidly against acceptance of the datum line proposals, and the adjourned delegate conference meeting of the 6th accepted the executives&apos; recom-mendation.Other bodies who have advised their members to vote against the owners&apos; offer are the councils of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association, the Nottinghamshire Miners&apos; Association, and the Leicestershire Miners&apos; Association, and the executive of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union.* The Leicestershire Miners&apos; Association, however, have recommended that, in the event of the owners&apos; offer being rejected, the matters at issue should be submitted to an impartial tribunal.The executive of the Amalgamated Miners and Manual Workers (West Lothian)* have recommended their members to abstain from the ballot and have decided to send no delegates to the national conference on the 14th. The executive of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers and the Council of the Warwickshire Miners&apos; Association have decided to make no recommendation to their members. On the other hand, the executive of the Cleveland Miners and Quarrymen&apos;s Association have advised acceptance of the owners&apos; offer. Unofficial stoppages of miners took place on the 4th in various localities in Scotland, Staffordshire and South Wales. Except in Lanarkshire, there was a general resumption of work on the 5th October.Oil Workers (National). The National Federation of General Workers and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation held a joint conference at Westminster on the 5th October to consider the formulation of a national programme of wages and working conditions for all men engaged in refining, grading, transporting and distributing mineral oils and by-products.  A sub-committee was appointed to draft the new programme.Electric Lamp Making Industry : Women Workers (National). The National Federa-tion of General Workers and the National Federation of Women Workers have formulated a demand for a minimum weekly wage of 50s. for women of 18 years and over, 38s. for those under 18, a percentage increase for piece-workers, and a week&apos;s annual holiday with pay, on behalf of women workers in the electric lamp making industry. Separate applica-tion is to bs made forthwith to the Electric Lamp Manufacturers&apos; Association and the British Electric Manufacturers&apos; Association.Tramwaijmen (Glasgow). The negotiations for an increase in the wages of the Glasgow tramwaymen have been delayed by a dispute between the two unions claiming to represent these men, namely, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association and the United Vehicle Workers. The Wages and Conditions of Service Committee of the Glasgow Corporation received deputa-tions from both unions on the 22nd September, and, after hearing the rival claims, asked the United Vehicle Workers to withdraw their claim that they alone should represent the tramway workers. The committee also decided to continue to recognise the Municipal Employees&apos; Association. The two unions, however, have now decided to present, as a joint wages demand, an amalgamation- of the claims already put forward by them sepa-rately, and the committee have decided to recognise both unions. The men&apos;s principal demand is for a minimum rate of  4 a week.Bakers (South Wales). On the 23rd September, a conference of the South Wales Master Bakers&apos; Federation and representatives of the operatives decided to recommend to the Council of the Master Bakers&apos; Federation that a Conciliation Board be formed, consisting of five representatives of the employers and five of the operatives.Printers (National). The conference between the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades and the newspaper proprietors&apos; associations on the one hand, and the executive of the Typographical Association on the other, which was held on the 29th* These two unions are members of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers, whose executive have decided to make no recommendation,
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.September, to consider an application for an .advance in wages for all the branches of the Typographical Association, was adjourned until the 7th October. It is understood that a small committee may examine the question of amending the existing grading scheme before the wages question is considered. A conference was also held on the 6th October between the representatives of the Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades and the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, to consider the application of the latter for a flat rate increase throughout the country of 15s. a week for men and 7s. Qd. for women. The employers made an offer which the men&apos;s representatives were unable to accept. The administrative council of the Federation will meet on the 12th October to deal with the situation.Shop Assistants (London). The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks are making representations on behalf of the employees of prac-tically all the leading drapery firms and large stores in the West End of London, for a 25 per cent, increase in the wages. The basis of the claim is the increase in the cost of living; and it is pointed out that since the last award of the Industrial Court to the employees of the Army and Navy Stores, the cost of living has increased- by 41 per cent. The union have offered to submit the whole of the applications to arbitration by the Court.Strikes and Lock-outs.Engineers. (Manchester). A mass meeting of 5,000 engineers at Manchester, on the 3rd October, passed a resolution protesting against the action of the executive council of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in refusing.to sanction the prohibition of overtime for maintenance work, and pledging themselves to refuse to work overtime until instructed to do so by the Manchester District Committee, who have resigned in protest against the removal of the prohibition.Settlements and Agreements.Engineers. As a result of a conference, on the 29th and 30th September, between the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations and the Amalgamated Engineer-ing Union, a joint recommendation, to be applied nationally, was unanimously agreed upon with regard to overtime and night shifts in the industry. This recommendation is subject to approval by the members of the union and the constituent bodies of the employers&apos; federations. The effect of the new agreement will be to substitute, for the varying local practices, a single national arrangement, applicable to all areas equally. For overtime, a minimum rate of time-and-a-half has been secured. The night-shift working week is to consist of five nights, totalling 47 hours, with breaks for meals to be arranged mutually.  The ordinary rate for night-shift work is to be time-and-a-third.The Sheffield and District Engineering Trades Employers&apos; Association have decided to put into full operation, as from the 4th October, the York memorandum of January last, and Award No. 84 of the Industrial Court, and to pay arrears under this agreement as soon as they can be calculated.*The demarcation dispute at the wor.ks of the Port Talbot Steel Co., Ltd., over a man employed as an electrician&apos;s assistant has been settled by the decision of the Electrical Trades Union that the man shall transfer his. membership to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation while he remains on this work. A national conference will be held to arrive at a working agreement on the general position with regard to demarcation.Cotton Spinners (Oldham). In connection with the unauthorised strike of spinners which began in the Oldham area on the 15th September, it is estimated that work has been fully resumed at 75 per cent, of the mills affected. The strike is now virtually confined to the districts of Shaw, Ptoyton and Lees. No resolution was passed at a mass meeting of Oldham operative spinners convened by the strike committee on the 3rd October, but the remarks made by the chairman, Mr. T. E. Guilfoyle, indicated that the strike committee had given up all hopes of success in their efforts to obtain a repudiation of the mule staffing agreement. A demand was made that the executive council of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners should be called upon to resign for signing the agreement without taking a ballot vote of members, and, with this object in view, a resolution was passed, urging all districts at their next monthly. meetings to reject the Council&apos;s minutes.__* It was in connection with Award No. 84 that the strike of members of the National Amalgamated Union of Bnginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and.Electrical Workers, employed as steam service men in the heavy steel trade, occurred in Sheffield, between the 31st May and the 9th June, 1920.(b 16515) 3 h\
(PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies and placings during the week ending the 24th September: 	Men.

The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 945 as regards men, and a decrease of 563 in respect of women. All divisions except the Scotland, Wales, and Ireland Divisions,report increases in the men&apos;s register, and all except Wales in the women&apos;s register.Metis Employment.Shipbuilding and Other Industries. There is no appreciable change in the shipbuilding and allied industries. At Govan, where the position is reported to be more encouraging than at any time during the preceding five weeks, the Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co., Ltd., have notified their intention of adding considerably to their skilled workmen in the near future. Firms at Paisley report an improvement in the delivery of steel plates, due to a consignment from America, but at Aberdeen and Dumbarton the shortage of material is said to be retarding the absorption of labour. &apos; In the Northern Division there is a tendency among employers to mark time pending a settlement of the coal dispute; Sunderland report that.one or two prospective shipyard orders have been cancelled in consequence. Difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of coal is reported from Middles-brough and Stockton-on-Tees. Consett report that trade and industry in the district are flourishing. There is practically no unemployment in this area. From Southampton it is reported that a firm have cancelled five contracts, each representing  60,000,in consequence of the threatened coal strike.In the North-Western Division the position is still far from satisfactory. The dominant feature of the Exchange reports is the almost unanimous statement that most trades have suffered severely from a slackness due to the uncertainty consequent on the threatened coal strike. There appears to be a widespread development of short-time working to obviate the immediate discharge of workers, which, incidentally, involves numerous claims to unemployment benefit. ;In the cotton trade unemployment seems,&apos; if anything, to have become more acute. Most cotton towns report the closing down of mills, and the curtailment of working hours in the continued absence of new orders. The reports from Blackburn,, Bolton, Burnley and Darwen are particularly depressing, and indicate no prospect of any early improvement. On the other hand, the building and ironfounding trades are brisk, and there is an unsatisfied demand for skilled labour./
4399.10.20,Employment Department-continued,No improvement is recorded in the boot and shoe, lace, hosiery and motor industries.Shortage of Labour. There is still a shortage of skilled building operatives throughout the country, and the demand for moulders, coremakers, railway wagon builders and repairers, and vehicle builders remains unsatisfied. There is unemployment, however, in London, in the painting and decorating and electrical trades, due to the cessation of seasonal work.Messrs. Rolls-Royce, Ltd., Derby, urgently require coppersmiths in connection with an order for Mesopotamia.At Cannock, 500 miners could easily be absorbed if housing and lodging accommodation were available.Industrial Developments. Portsmouth report preliminary arrangements for the employment of labour in connection with the erection of metal-breaking factories on the Farlington Race Course. It is expected that about a thousand workpeople will be required.The Edison Swan Electric Co., Ltd., Enfield, are shortly expected to take on additional labour in connection with the production of a new lamp.Labour Reductions. From Woking it is reported that about 40 employees have been discharged by Accumulators, Ltd., owing to lack of orders. At Northampton, Messrs. Hanwell, motor-cycle makers, are suspending 30 male workers owing to trade depression.Shortage of Material. In addition to the shortage of coal and material for the ship-building industry, referred to above, it is reported that a chemical firm at Hebburn-on-Tyne have dispensed with 60 workmen, owing to shortage of material. A shortage of cement is retarding progress of housing contracts at Dunfermline. Cambridge report that insufficient supplies of granite and tar are holding up repair work on the main roads in that district.Miscellaneous. At Swansea, where five local spelter works have recently been closed, a consignment of spelter has been received from the United States.Women&apos;&apos;s Employment.Industrial. The general trade depression appears to be on the increase. Short time is being worked in many industries, causing under-employment rather than unemployment. Discharges are, however, taking place and the live registers of women are gradually increasing, although not perhaps as rapidly as might have been expected.In the North-Western Division, unemployment is stated to be increasing. From the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division continued depression in the textile industry is reported, but, although short time is on the increase, not very much complete unemploy-ment has resulted hitherto. In some areas there is still an unsatisfied demand for skilled workers, which has, however, decreased considerably. Depression is also reported in wholesale clothing, shirt making, blouse machining and hosiery manufacture. Acute depression continues in the lace industry.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report under-employment and slackness in the principal industries. There is no improvement in the situation in the boot and shoe trade; the straw hat trade continues slack; and there is also depression in the wholesale clothing, hosiery and elastic web making factories.The depression in the metal, jewellery, leather and rubber industries of the West Midlands Division continues, but great activity is still prevalent in the pottery trade.The London and South-Eastern Division state that the depression in evidence since April is increasing, especially in the factory areas of East and South-East London. Many skilled workers of various types are unemployed. The problem of finding work for un-skilled factory workers and semi-skilled clerks still remains acute. The tailoring, * dressmaking, leather, confectionery, tin-box making, boot, paper and printing, soap and rubber industries are affected. Many Exchanges comment on slackness in the laundry trade.In the South-Western Division the main demand for women has always been in the domestic categories. Such industries as exist, as, for example, wholesale clothing, are depressed, and increasing difficulty is experienced in placing workers. The situation in Wales, where some slackness in the staple tinplate industry is reported, is similar. In the Northern Division also there are few women&apos;s industries, and these are discharging employee^ rather than employing fresh workers.In Scotland unemployment is increasing in the Clydebank area, and slackness continues in the jute trade in Dundee; the linen industry is slack in Dunfermline, and(b 16515) 3 L 2
Employment Department-continued.hosiery in Irvine. The spinning mills at Kirkcaldy are on short time, but there is a demand for weavers at Paisley, Port Glasgow and Galashiels.Reports from Ireland state that, owing to civil commotion, industry in the Belfast and Lisburn districts has been seriously disorganised, and that the continued dislocation of the railway services has had a very adverse effect on industry in the South and West. Factories have been obliged to reduce their staffs, and a large number of workers are un-employed. The holiday resorts have also suffered. In Derry, the dispute in the shirt and collar trade has been settled and work in these factories is now normal. Employment in the tailoring trade in Dublin has also improved.Agricultural. A number of hop pickers have been placed in the London and South-Eastern Division. At Maidstone about 300 local applications were received as a result of an announcement that Maidstone employers were willing to engage as many local hop pickers as the Exchange could supply. A further order for hop pickers was also received from Guildford during the week. At Faversham the season is finishing. The Gloucester Exchange placed a number of women temporarily in fruit picking and pea picking during the past month, and 100 workers were sent to Hereford for hop picking. About 20 Worcester women have been placed during the week in hop picking.The Bedford Exchange report a small order for potato pickers. The work is rough and some difficulty is experienced in filling the vacancies. At Peterborough orders for potato pickers have been deferred owing, probably, to the heavy rains. Similar orders have been received at Chesterfield, Goole, Scunthorpe and Lincoln. If housing accom-modation can be arranged, women from Lincoln are to be sent for this employment to Boston, where the work will last for at least two months. A motor tractor driver has been placed by this Exchange. The Scottish potato-lifting season is expected to be slightly late, but promises to be fairly busy.The seasonal Exchanges for raspberry picking, at Auchterarder and Blairgowrie, brought 1,936 workers from other districts to Auchterarder and 1,512 to Blairgowrie. In addition Blairgowrie supplied 429 local pickers. Heavy rains and high winds resulted in the harvest being short of expectation, and the season was shorter than in previous years.Domestic Service. Recent reports as to private domestic service are more encouraging. The London and South-Eastern Division report that on the whole the situation is somewhat easier, and Gravesend, Great Marlborough Street, Richmond, Shepherd&apos;s Bush, Tooting and Woolwich all report a definite improvement in the attitude of applicants. The supply of daily workers is still greatly in excess of the demand in this division.The South-Western Division state that efforts to persuade women registered as clerks, or for other occupations in which there is no demand, to take up work as children&apos;s nurses, probationer nurses or domestics are in many cases successful.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report that unemployed women are persuaded to accept domestic work with a little less difficulty than formerly. Various &quot; man-and-wife &quot; vacancies have been filled.The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division emphasise the difficulties experienced in placing applicants in domestic work. The Bradford Exchange report that experience would seem to indicate that there are possibilities of developing this work, but that it takes up a great deal of time, and needs special staff, the number of women placed representing a very small return for the time involved.The North-Western Division states that there is generally a decided improvement, although the demand is still very much in excess of the supply. The Northern Division also state that applicants are taking up domestic work more readily, and that the supply of domestic workers is more nearly meeting the demand.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Re-settlement-The present serious state of unemployment and its probable increase during the winter has been the subject of exhaustive inquiry by many committees. In a number of cases,. deputations have been formed to visit the local authorities, with the view to the adoption of local schemes of construction work, and the
Employment. Department-continued.consideration of the question of obtaining grants from the Ministry of Transport for such work as road making and repairing.The Portsmouth Committee have taken up the matter of a ship-breaking scheme with Lord Lytton. Difficulty has been experienced in obtaining wharfage accommodation, but every effort is being made to overcome this obstacle.Chelmsford are seeking the support of the Essex County Council to prepare a scheme, for submission to the Development Commission, for the reclamation of foreshore, as a means for providing employment for a considerable number of ex-Service men.Tottenham request the Minister to approach the Ministry of Health with a view to seeking early sanction for the various schemes for public works put forward by the Urban District Council. The Shoreditch Committee recommend that housing should proceed with greater expedition, in order that a demand for furniture may be created, which would materially assist in reducing unemployment in the district.Ex-Service Men. Ex-Service men, especially the disabled, continue to occupy a prominent place in the considerations of committees. The Pontypridd and Rhondda Committeees report that there are, only two disabled men remaining on the registers of the local offices. The Blackburn Committee, after considering a letter from the chairman of the Rotherham Committee, passed a resolution requesting all public bodies to make the National Scheme for the Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men part of the Fair Con-tracts Clause, and, in placing contracts, to employ only those firms who are fulfilling the conditions of the scheme. The Borough Committee have called the Ministers attention to the fact that a number of ex-Service men are invoking sympathy by their disablement, and are appealing for alms in the streets. They recommend that, in the interests of genuine cases, the position of these men should be considered with a view to imposing some restrictions.Grantham are taking action with the postal authorities on the employment on night work of two men in daily employment. They suggest that two disabled men could easily do the work. The attention of the Carlisle Committee has been drawn to the appointment to a Government position in the city of a married woman, at a salary which would pay for the services of two disabled officers. The appointment is understood to be causing considerable feeling, and the Divisional Controller is taking the matter up.womens Work. Blackburn are of opinion that there should be closer co-operation between the local education authority, the local War Pensions Committee, and the Women&apos;s Sub-Committee, and recommend that representatives from these committees should be co-opted on the Women&apos;s Sub-Committee,Miscellaneous. The Lewisham Committee urge the necessity for the extension of the tube railways from the City to the south-eastern area of London. They also recommend that no further exportation of cement should be allowed until the full demand of the building trade in England has been met.The Bridgwater Sub-Committee of the West Somerset Committee have approached the Great Western Railway Co. in regard to difficulties of collection and delivery experienced by a firm who have recently established works in the area. The company agreed to alter certain demarcation limits previously imposed.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 23rd September, show 726 payments to civilian workers, and 144,866 to ex-members of the Forces. The total amount disbursed to date is  22,403,706 to civilian workers and  33,122,251 to ex-members of the Forces.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 17th September was 43,035, involving an amount of  22,293 6s. 3e .0    .DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to the 29th September, 20,815 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled under the scheme. The undertakings jgiven cover 243,949 disabled ex-Service men.
Employment Department-continued.The Divisional Controller of the London and South-Eastern Division reports that during the month a steady now of undertakings has been received. In the Walham Green area, a lively interest has been shown by employers. This is attributed to the clause in Govern-ment contracts giving preference to signatories of the scheme.A departmental committee has been set up to inquire into the whole position regarding the employment of severely disabled men.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.The Two Bay-Shift System: Juvenile Workers. Juvenile Employment Com-mittees have been asked to consider the desirability of retaining the two day-shift system for juvenile workers as proposed in the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill. The committees at Colchester, High Wycombe, Ipswich and Leeds have already passed resolutions deprecating the retention of the system.The Grays Juvenile Employment Committee report that, pending the passage of this Bill, the Thames Paper Co., Ltd., have limited the number of their girl employees. The firm are the best employees of juvenile labour in the district.Juvenile Unemployment. Even in the West Midlands Division, where the demand for boys has for some time greatly exceeded the supply, there is no evidence of increasing unemployment. In Birmingham the past month has witnessed a complete change in the industrial situation, and, at the moment, great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining vacancies for boys. The girls&apos; live register has also increased, and practically no vacancies are being notified. Most of the applicants give shortage of work as the reason for their discharge.School Exemptions. As an example of the difficulties incident to the working of the present law of school attendance, it may be noted that several boys under 14 presented themselves at the Walsall Exchange to register for employment. They produced exemption certificates granted by the education authority on the ground that they had obtained satis-factory employment. On investigation, however, there appeared to be reason to suspect that this employment had been used merely to secure exemption, and that the boys had had no intention of accepting the work offered. The matter was reported to the secretary of the Education Committee.APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS DEPARTMENT. APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 24th September, the Appointments Department placed 506 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 41,347. Of these, 5,652 were placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 865 ex-Service men and 31 civilians, bringing the total of candidates available for appointments on that date to 14,474 ex-Service men and 1,904 civilians. At the same date 1,495 &quot;live&quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the Department, 688 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 24th September the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 197 ex-officers and men of equal educational qualifications, of which 132 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,333 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 50,527 for training of the types provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,016 applications, of which 22,706 &apos;have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,507 applications and sanctioned grants in 17,742 cases.
Appointments and Training-continued.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions,Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 843 cases, in 406 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Minister of Labour have completed their training in 200 cases and abandoned training in 38; 142 are still in training and 22 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistical. On the 29th September, 25,176 men were in training, as against 25,102 on the 22nd September, and 24,391 on the 1st September. There were 18,426 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 22nd September and the 1st September being 18,984 and 20,065, respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 17,234, the totals for the 22nd September and the 1st September being 16,820 and 15,613 respectively.The month of September was one of well-marked progress after a period during which, partly owing to trade and other holidays, the rate had slackened considerably. Uncer-tainties with regard to the general labour outlook, and restrictions on admissions to certain trades, may bring a further period of comparative slackness. Otherwise the later autumn months might be expected to show even better figures than those for September, as the demand for training is then likely to be at its highest.Elementary Teachers. The second training college scheme under the direct control of the department may now be regarded as launched. The scheme, at Springfield College, Moseley, is on lines similar to those of Sarisbury Court. The college will be partly residential, and can provide living accommodation for 68 students and 18 members of the staff. In addition, provision will be made for 82 non-resident students. Additional class-room accommodation will be required. The Board of Education have approved both the premises and the scheme proposed. A number of suitable candidates are awaiting training, and it is hoped that a start will be made at an early date.Pug Making. The Comrades of the Great War have suggested a scheme for the training of disabled men in Turkey rug making, a form of work specially suitable for those more seriously disabled. The scheme, which is supported by the department, is to be worked somewhat on the lines of the Lord Roberts Memorial Workshops. A start has been made in the Manchester district.Building. A suggestion has been received from the South-Western area that men under instruction in the building trades should be placed on the building work carried out by the Royal Engineers in connection with barracks and similar buildings. There are certain special difficulties connected with this proposal, as, for example, the impossibility of securing an agreement as to the period of training, but it is hoped that, with the assistance of the War Office, these difficulties will not be found insuperable.Government Instructional Factories. The Minister, during his recent visit to the North, took the opportunity of inspecting the Birtley and Walker Factories, and the housing site on which men in training at Walker are employed. The Newcastle Chronicle, in referring to the Ministers visits, published appreciative comments on training work generally.Equipment and Supplies. Deliveries to Central Stores during the week include boot and shoe tools, and large consignments of woodworking tools, together with supplies of overalls and aprons. During the week, 108 orders were placed, the largest number on record.National Trade Advisory Committees: Bespoke Tailoring. A conference between -the department, the National Trade Advisory Committee, and the chairmen and vice-chairmen of Local Technical Advisory Committees was held on the 23rd September. Treasury sanction for the amended scheme drawn up by the National Trade Advisory Committee was announced, the changes involved being extension of the improvership period with maintenance, and alterations in the learners&apos; ra&apos;tes. The scheme was adopted by the conference. A resolution was unanimously passed drawing the attention of the Government to the case of men trained under Government schemes, but handicapped by high disabilities from becoming normal workers.
Appointments and Training-continued.National Trade Advisory Committees: Cotton-A meeting of the National Trade Advisory Committee was held at Manchester on the 1.6th September. The Divisional Director and the Chief Technical Officer informed the committee that progress was most satisfactory in every way, and that all Local Technical Advisory Committees were anxious to do everything they could to help the scheme. The following resolution was passed unanimously, and is now being considered by the department :-&quot; If, in the opinion of the Local Technical Advisory Committee, any trainee, before the cxpira-tion of his period of training, is earning and receiving the full average adult wage of his occupation at the mill where he is working, the Local Technical Advisory Committee may, subject to the consent of the Divisional Director, if the circumstances justify, at their discretion terminate the training allowance.&quot;Local Technical Advisory Committees: Dental Mechanics. The Consett and Durham Committee have passed the following resolution, to be brought before the National Trade Advisory Committee : &quot; That, in view of the difficulty in placing trainees with registered dental surgeons, even after 18 months&apos; training, this committee arc strongly of the opinion that dental work under War Pensions Committees and other schemes connected with the Government should be placed exclusively with (a) surgeons who have served in the war, or (b) surgeons who employ trainees, or (c) surgeons who at present employ, as mechanics, at least 50 per cent, of ex-Service men.&quot;Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics.-^ to the 29th September, 41 schemes had been approved. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 20th September was 202, making a total of 44,324. The number of applications received from apprentices was 276, making a total of 49,855.Up to the 29th September, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 42,964 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 41,273 apprentices, employed by 16,308 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 1.1,000.Wages. Difficulty is being caused in the building trades at Redruth by the special arrangements governing the payment of journeymen. With two exceptions, the employers pay the full union rate of Is. Sd. per hour only in the summer, and, during slack periods, a much lower rate is paid, by agreement with the workpeople, to avoid discharges. This has hindered the adoption of the scheme, since, if paid on the basis of the full prescribed rates, the apprentices will receive much more than the skilled men during parts of the year.The Bridgewater Sub-Committee of the West Somersetshire Local Employment Committee complain that apprentices who were in their last year on enlistment are &quot; being turned adrift,&quot; because they require the wages of a skilled mechanic, which, in the opinion of many employers, they are unable to earn.Applications. At Barrow every demobilised apprentice is in employment, and the position appears to be equally favourable at East Ham, Kettering and Sheerness.As regards apprentices who cannot find employers under the scheme, the Pembroke Dock Employment Committee have unanimously resolved that the Ministry should urge employers to employ apprentices who have been interrupted by service in H.M. Forces in preference to others. There have been great difficulties in this district, and a canvass of all employers in Milford Haven and Pembroke Dock produced no result. At -Darlington and Cheltenham the Local Employment Committees propose to take special action to find employers for all &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices.Unemployment.-The prevailing industrial slackness in the London and South-Eastern area appears to be increasingly affecting apprentices under the scheme, and is influencing the demand for institutional training. In London itself there may be difficulty in providing for dental mechanics after their renewed apprenticeship ; but local headquarters anticipate that employment can readily be found for them in country districts if they are prepared to accept it. At Leeds, trade depression appears to be affecting some apprentices in the printing industry, but improvement is expected shortly. At Glasgow Messrs. Barr &amp; Stroud, Ltd., scientific instrument makers, have set themselves very strongly against the suspension or dismissal of apprentices,, in spite of the fact that they are very short of work.

The increasing numbers of applications in the London area are due in many cases to slackness of trade; local headquarters point out that institutional training might be the means of providing for many who would otherwise be unemployed.In the Northern area, the secretary of the executive council of the plumbers&apos; association has urged that returning apprentices should have the advantage of the training facilities which are provided for disabled men.General Training: Apprentices and Boys.Apprenticeship : Building Industry. Reports upon the prospects of the national scheme in the South-Western area are more hopeful. Many federated firms are now expected to adopt it in full, and new draft working rules for the area are reported to lay down that boys shall be apprenticed under the scheme. Local schemes, following the national scheme in their main outline, are in course of preparation or negotiation in several important towns, and one or two are actually in operation. In some rural towns, however, difficulties with non-federated firms are likely to continue.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands area, while there is general agreement as to the need for reviving apprenticeship, many firms object to the intervention of any outside body in their treatment of apprentices, and in particular to transfer from firm to firm during training. The wages rates of the national scheme are reported to be very little higher than those arranged by the Yorkshire Area Joint Council for the Building Trades, r Complaint is made of the men&apos;s unwillingness to train the boys, and it is held that the unions might do 1 more to ensure their co-operation. A Sheffield firm expect that the boys&apos; dislike of being bound will seriously hinder the revival of indentures.In the North-Western area little seems yet to be known of the scheme in some important districts, but its consideration is to be undertaken by the associations concerned. The position is complicated in Liverpool by the fact that the master builders&apos; association are not now affiliated to the master builders&apos; federation.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on page 435.]INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: REPORTS.Scottish Baking. The Reference Committee on the 28th September decided to recom- -mend to the Council an increase of 2s. per week to operatives in Kirkcaldy, in order to bring the rate up to that of Dunfermline, and to refer the question of an 8 a.m. start in Glasgow to a meeting of the local Joint Committee, at which members of the Industrial Council would be present. The Council accepted these recommendations. It was decided to hold a special meeting of the committee to hear the claims of Perth, Falkirk and Stirling for an increase in wages. At the same time, the employers declined to take any action with regard to a claim from Ayrshire for a 4s. increase, to bring wages up to the Glasgow rate, as they con-sidered that this raised the whole question of a flat rate of wages for Scotland.The question of female labour in bakeries has become acute since the last meeting, and the Glasgow operatives have given notice to 50 of the 200 Glasgow employers that they will withdraw their labour unless all women are dismissed. After discussion, the operatives decided to send the president of their union, and the Glasgow member of the union executive council, to a meeting of the Glasgow branch which was being held that night, to persuade the branch to withdraw their strike notices, or, at any rate, to withhold them until the whole question of female labour in Scottish bakeries had been settled by the Council. The Council will meet again on the 12th October, to endeavour to reach an agree-ment on the question.Building. The hitch continues in regard to the clause on the question of payment for wet time, to be incorporated in an agreement between the Resettlement Committee and the Cabinet Committee on Housing. It is not yet clear that the relative values of the^wet time proposals of the Government and of the employers are fully appreciated.(b 16515) 3 W

The District Council for Sussex, Hampshire and Dorset met on the 27th September, It was reported that basic rates and conditions of service which had been agreed by the District Council had been approved by the National Council.Glass-The sub-committee appointed to deal with the &quot;Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill met on the 28th September. The committee had before them two resolutions passed at a joint conference between the British Flint Glass Manufacturers&apos; Association and the National Flint Glass Makers&apos; Society. The first embodied the suggestion that the sub-committee, on behalf of the Council, should request the Home Secretary to receive a deputation from the two associations.

Wages and Arbitration Department-continued.AGREEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS.Basket Makers (London). The employers in the London basket making industry held a meeting on the 28th September and agreed that the operatives&apos; claim should be referred to arbitration.The joint meeting of the parties, arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, could not take place on the 29th September, as it was not until that day that the opera-tives could meet to consider the question of arbitration. When they met, however, the operatives also decided in favour of this course. Work is being resumed, and it is expected that all will be restarted by the 4th October, after which the matter will be referred to the Industrial Court for decision. Some difficulty has arisen with regard to the blind workers, owing to lack of work, but it is hoped that this difficulty will be overcome.Pottery Trade Dispute (Scotland). On the 12th July, the National Society of Pottery Workers put forward to the Potters&apos; Federation, Ltd., a demand for an increase of wages-to various grades, including&apos;&apos; an increase of Qd. an hour to pressers. The federation replied that the state of the trade would not permit of the claims being considered. The pressers&apos; claim, among others, has continued to be the subject of comment, and an advance of \\d. an hour was granted to them on the 13th September. The pressers were much dissatisfied, and struck on the 18th September in support of their original demand. Only 14 men were involved, but, as they are key men, considerable inconvenience was caused. The strike was unofficial, and the employers threatened a lock-out if the strikers did not resume work by the 2nd October. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, secured a resumption of work on the 30th September, an assurance being given that, as soon as work was started, the Conciliation Board Rules would be signed, and that a meeting of the Board would then be convened forthwith to consider the strikers&apos; claim.Sheep Slaughterers (Carlisle). A dispute having arisen in Carlisle between the master butchers and the National Union of General Workers respecting piece-prices for killing sheep, the Chief Conciliation Officer, Newcastle, took steps to convene a conference. The following agreement was reached : The price per sheep slaughtered to be 9d.; droving in the city to be paid for. Starting time on all week-days, including Friday if there is any work on that day, to be 6 a.m;, an earlier start to be left to the men according to the circumstances.

Balm, Hill &amp; Sons, Ltd., Nottingham, lace manufacturers, and the Female Embroidery Workers&apos; Association^ the Chief Conciliation Officer states that a settlement has been arrived at, the firm agreeing to pay a bonus of 15 per cent., instead of the present bonus of 10 per cent., pending a revision of the local Agreement of Prices, such revision to take place in January, 1921.  The firm have also agreed to recognise the trade union.Women Packers (Newcastle-on-Tyne). The National Federation of Women Workers put forward a claim for an increase in wages to their members employed by Messrs. Mawson &amp; Swan, Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne, photographic packers. The women received Id. per hour, proportionately lower rates being paid to girls. As the result of intervention by the department, an agreement was reached whereby the wages of all women workers were advanced by 15 per cent, as from the 4th September.COMMITTEES, CONFERENCES AND DEPUTATIONS.Mersey Ship Repair Trade. A deputation from the shipwrights&apos; and boilermakers&apos; societies met Sir David.Shackleton on the 29th September. They stated that the strikef had not yet been officially sanctioned by the trade union executive. The men wished to revert to the pre-war practice whereby wages in the Liverpool area were regulated by local agreement, but the employers now preferred national agreements. The deputation asked for a Court of Inquiry, but Sir David replied that it appeared to him that the Court would have to inquire into an award which had been issued by the Industrial Court, and the Ministry would not agree that such a case should go to a Court of Inquiry. He undertook to see the employers and to ascertain their view. A meeting with the employers has been arranged for the 7th October.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 7, 14th August, p. 258. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 10, 4th September, p. 314.
Wages and Arbitration Department-continued.INTERPRETATIONS AND RULINGS.Interpretation of Awards. It has been ascertained that the Industrial Court are willing to give an interpretation of an award on the application of one party only.QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.Shoe Rivet and Wire Nail Workers (Birmingham). On the 10th July about 90 tool-makers struck for an increase of 50 per cent, in their rate per machine. This the employers consider exorbitant, in view of the rise of wages since 1914. The employers informed the Shoe Rivet and Wire Nail Makers&apos; Society that they were prepared to allow a resumption of work &quot;as far as possible, on condition that the claim was withdrawn. After consultation with the Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, the union officials agreed to suggest to their members that work should be resumed, on the prices and conditions in operation before the dispute, subject to the employers agreeing that a conference should be held as soon as possible after the resumption of work to discuss certain points of difference.Urban District Clerical Staff (Pontypridd). The result of the conferences arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer between the Pontypridd Urban District Council and the &quot; Whitley &quot; District Council on the one hand, and representatives of the National Associa-tion of Local Government Officers on the other, has been that the clerks have withdrawn the strike notices, and agreed to allow the National Industrial Council scale of wages to be considered by the South Wales and Monmouthshire Provincial Council for. Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services.Inter-Union Dispute (Workington). In consequence of a dispute as to whether brick-layers&apos; labourers in the employment of the Workington, Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd., should belong to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation or to the National Association of Builders&apos; Labourers, the latter union have threatened to withdraw all maintenance bricklayers and labourers on Tees-side. The matter has been discussed with a representative of the Con-federation, who is of opinion that a means of settling the dispute, will be&apos; found, as the Confederation are negotiating with the federation to, which the operative bricklayers and the National Association of Builders&apos; Labourers belong, on the general question of membership demarcation.Trade Unionism: Toy Trade. The National Federation of Women Workers recently notified the department that their members employed by Messrs. Dean&apos;s Rag Book Co., Ltd., had been informed that they would be dismissed Unless they withdrew from the union. At a conference with a representative of the department, the firm&apos;s represen-tatives contended that, if they recognised the Federation, it would be necessary for them to discuss with trade union officials technical matters connected with the toy trade, on which subject the union did not possess expert knowledge. It was understood that several big employers in the trade had agreed not to recognise any trade union. The firm, wish to consider further the department^ suggestion that the notice recently put up in their works should be withdrawn.Lair age Workers (BirkenJiead and Manchester). The Birkenhead employers have refused to accept the department^ suggestion of a conference on wages and working conditions, as they consider that the question of an increase in wages would not arise if the union would submit a scheme for the reduction of labour in lairages, the amount of surplus labour at present employed being responsible for the low wages earned. The union refuse to consent to a reduction in their members so employed, and matters are now at a deadlock.The strike in,Manchester still continues, the same arguments being brought forward. The employers are not prepared to give any further advance in wages, and state that they are able to carry on with non-union labour. They are stated to be employing the strikers, at agreed rates, to kill batches of beasts as they arrive, and discharging them when the work is done.County Council Employees (Cardiganshire). A letter has been addressed to the Council urging that a special meeting should be convened to consider this long outstanding disputed[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration will be fbund also on pages 430 to 437.]* See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 13, 25th September, p. 404.
