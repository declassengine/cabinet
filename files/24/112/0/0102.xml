Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SEOREM3GYPT.it ip i3rty or tv. ion i.*CJ?\^o- The proposals of Lord Milner&apos;s mission to Egypt have now been circulated to the Cabinet, and I feel bound to draw the attention of my colleagues to the effect of these proposals on Indian affairs. I know so very little about Egypt that it is only from, this standpoint that I would approach the subject, and I am quite, prepared to believe that Lord Milner&apos;s proposals are in every way suitable to the conditions of Egypt.(1) I would draw the attention of the Cabinet to the marked difference between the two missions-to India and to Egypt. The mission of the Secretary of State for India to India was carefully considered by the Cabinet. Its view was circumscribed by a Cabinet pronouncement; it was instructed to discuss only with the Government of India : its proposals were formulated in a report to the Cabinet. They were only published with the permission of the Cabinet, and they were then laid before Parliament..I can find no record that Lord M.milner&apos;s mission was ever considered by the Cabinet. No limitation was placed upon his mission. His proposals were published months before the Cabinet had ever seen them, and he negotiated not with the Government of Egypt, but with the extremists in Egypt, and his proposals were published as being contingent in their fulfilment on their acceptance by the extremists. I do not believe that there is any weight to be attached to the suggestion that because they had not been approved when published by the Government Ave have a free hand. Theoretically, that may be so. Practically, loyalty to our colleague, the position that he holds, and the authority with which he put forward his proposals, ties our hands. He is prepared, and if I am right in my premise, the Government is jjrepared, to do what he suggests if Zaghlul will accept it. (Am 1 right in describing Zaghlul as the Tilak, the Gandhi, or the de Valera of Egyptian politics ?) If he will accept no consideration of efficient Government, no consideration of the fact that Egypt as a Protectorate has been incorporated in the British Imperial system, no consideration of the well-being of Egyptian civil servants is to modify or circum-scribe his proposal. In India, Parliament has demanded and the Government has been scrupulous to secure that the employment of Indian civil servants, and indeed their prospects of employment, shall not be jeopardised by any reforms. Disorder, inefficient Government, is to be avoided. Searching enquiries are to be made as to whether the new Government will be really representative of the people. I can find no trace that these considera-tions weighed in Egypt. I have always been told that India cannot aspire to self-government because ultimately the maintenance of order and the 4 preservation of public safety depends upon the British Army. For Egypt, I 2535     100 10.20
presume that the British garrison that is still to continue, would not remain absolutely quiescent whatever happened internally in Egypt now that Egyptian independence is to be complete. The extremists in India are ignored, and I understand that nobody disputed the wisdom of doing so. In Egypt, the treaty . is made with the extremists. I, like the Secretary of State for War, can find nothing which makes it possible to negotiate with Zaghlul, which does not at least point the way to a negotiation with de Valera or Gandhi, and I have only to say that, apart from the conditions, for nobody can doubt the difference between Egypt and India, the methods of the Milner proposals contrasted with the method of settlement of Indian affairs, has enormously increased our Indian difficulties. My police reports show this conclusively. My letters from the Governors emphasise it.   Let me quote :  &quot; The general impression in Indian circles is that Great Britain has been compelled to make Egypt independent, that the Egyptians have by intrigue and violent agitation, gained freedom for themselves.   They add that those who advocate moderation and counsel the adoption of consti-tutional methods of political agitation in India will have to hang their heads in shame and that a veritable premium is put on violence, anarchy and anti-British intrigue.   On one point Indians of all classes are agreed that the concession of independence to Egypt is a grievous blow to British prestige.   That it will greatly add to the difficulties and political com-plications of Great Britain in various parts of the world ; that its effect on the situation in Mesopotamia, Persia and Central Asia generally will be very bad; and that it will also put heart into the Turks, who had begun to despair of their success.   In Indian circles the opinion is general that the decline and fall of the British Empire has begun, that the British have degenerated, and that the process will be rapid, if what has been done in Egypt is followed before long in Ireland and the oversea Dominions.&quot;As I have stated in another paper, it is difficult for us to insist upon the control of foreign relations in Mesopotamia when we have abandoned it in Egypt. Mesopotamia has never been incorporated in the British Imperial system. All 1 can say is that Lord Milners proposals may lead to peace in Egypt. I can only hope that it may be possible to treat one part of the British Empire wholly separately and without reference to other parts. I envy proposals which do not require Parliamentary enactment, and have not got to regard the well-being of the Civil Services for fear of the ex-civil servants and their influence on the Government. I do not see that they even regard the well-being of British commercial interests which I am always enjoined to protect and safeguard in India.I repeat that I do not write in any hostility to the proposals which I am unable to judge, but merely to contrast them with the admittedly different conditions in India.E.
