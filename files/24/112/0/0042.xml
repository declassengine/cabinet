summary.general.During the month thore has been a considerable extension of the International Revolutionary Movement notably in Italy.prance.For the time being moderate influences prevail in the Industrial world and agitation has been driven underground. The French having success-fully disposed of their strike movement, are anxiously watching the issue of the coal strike here.belgium..The general situation of the country is less settled on account of the continued Industrial depression.italy.The declared object of the C.G-.T. in the Milan strikes makes it clear that revolutionary trouble is inevitable. The Minister of Labour admits that the action of the workers indicates a spread of Bolshevik tendencies. The Italian Foreign Minister has declared his willingness to negotiate with Vorovski, the Soviet representative, but refuses, in view of similar action by Great Britain, to accept Litvinoff as a Bolshevik emissary.spain.The policy of the new Civil Government in releasing imprisoned Syndicalist leaders has led to a recrudescence of agitation in Barcelona.portugal.Labour unrest continues and is attributed to the extremist tendencies of the Government and the influence of the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires.norway.Attempts to revive trade with Russia continue, in many instances with discouraging results.sweden.Relations between the Swedish Government and the Soviet Govern-ment have been strained. The German representative in Stockholm has proclaimed the neutrality of his country in the event of hostilities.denmark.Danish Socialists remain attached to the Second International and have not been influenced by recent developments in British and French extremist circles.holland.Opposition to the anti-revolutionary law has ended in failure. Ex-tremists appear to be more engaged with their own differences than in attacks upon existing institutions.germany.Details are given of Russian subsidies in support of the disturbances which took place in the Ruhr district in April. The Moscow authorities have ordered the leaders of the German National Communist Party to merge with the Spartakusbund. This the former have refused to do, preferring to maintain their separate organisation.   Litvinoff is reliablyA 2
reported to bo negotiating for tho foundation of a Russian-Gorman Clearing House at Berlin or Copenhagen. Herr Hugo Stinnos is actively endeavouring to discredit the Republic with the ultimate object of restoring the German Monarchy.switzerland.Platten and other Communists have boon trying, without much success, to effect a fusion between the various sections of the Communist Party. Attempts are being made, with the help of Irish and Egyptian agitators in Paris, to make La Feuille a journal of world-wido importance.austria.The Russian Soviet Government is now displaying considerable interest in Austrian affairs;czechoslovakia.The Communist movement is reported to be gaining ground in the mining and industrial districts with Teschen as the centre of revolutionary tendencies.russia.A speech of Lenin is quoted as illustrating the views of the Bolsheviks with regard to the present European situation. There are no signs of any economic revival. The peasants continue to ignore the Soviet authorities and pay little attention to their decrees. Salt is being used as currency in the country districts. The Government has started a campaign against the revolutionary Socialists, and has placed a price on the head of Tchernov for giving an unfavourable impression of the Soviet regime to the British delegates.esthonia.The Bolshevik delegation are busy with propaganda among the industrial population.poland.The Communists in Warsaw remained quiet during the Russian advance, and Trotsky has declared that no reliance can be placed on them.roumania.A raid on Socialist headquarters at Bucharest disclosed a large quantity of Roumanian bank notes which have been identified as part of a stock sent in 1917 to Moscow for safe keeping. This confirms the much denied accusation that the Roumanian Socialists are in Russian pay.greece.The prospects of the Royalist Party have suffered from Great Britain&apos;s refusal to recognise King Constantino as the head of any Allied or friendly State, and are now considered to be all but hopeless.persia.The Persian Government has instructed its Minister at Rome to enter into direct relations with the Soviet Government.
egypt.The word &quot; Bolshevism &quot; is acquiring political strength as symbolising somo sort of revolutionary movement against the richer classes. Egyptians in Switzerland openly state that they have the support of the Italian Government and that arrangements have been made in Rome for the supply of arms to be shipped to Egypt in submarines.japan.German prestige in Japan is reported to be practically as high now as before tho war..siberia.An agreement between Moscow and the Japanese Government is reported, by which the Far Eastern Republic is to be recognised and to be free to negotiate with foreign powers.canada.The Communist Labour Party&apos;s anxiety to extend its activities in Canada has been welcomed by revolutionary leaders. The first com-mercial representative of the Bolshevik Government has reached Montreal from New York, and proposes eventually to establish a permanent Russian commercial bureau.australia.Advanced Labour circles hold that the political and economic changes advocated by the Labour Party are in no way affected by Australians connection with the British Empire. A refusal to work on Saturdays has threatened a number of important industries with serious dislocation.united states op america.The increase of unauthorised strikes is causing anxiety to the American Federation of Labour. Conditions in the coalfields are unsatisfactory. Sinn Fein in the United States seems to be genuinely anxious for a simple and immediate settlement of the Irish question.
A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.It is clear that for the time being moderate influences prevail in the industrial world. M. Jouhaux has openly stated that he is not prepared to go so far as MM. Cachin and Frossard in support of the Soviet Government in Russia, and has attacked the Third International. The recent successes of the Poles have also caused considerable consternation in Extremist circles, who complain that France, not Great Britain, is the enemy of Communism.But, although the Extremists of all the Federations have been com-pletely routed, agitators are still busy behind the scenes. The Extremist minority of the Federation of Railway Workers has declared its intention to renew its propaganda, and a similar policy is being adopted by the Extremists on the National Federal Committee of the C.G.T.Anarchist and Communist propaganda is reported to be increasing, although there is a certain amount of divergency of opinion in the Communist ranks on this question. At a recent meeting of the Minority Trades Union Congress 37 organisations were represented. The leaders of the C.G.T. were violently criticised, and a resolution was passed in favour of adherence in principle to the Third International. Mr. Lansbury is reported to have addressed a meeting in Paris a short time ago at which he said that he approved of the campaign of the Sinn Feiners, and ended his address with praise of Lenin and Trotsky. It is reported that the Police Union in France and the French Colonies has been dissolved by referendum.BELGIUM.The military alliance with France has the support of the Walloons, but is opposed by the Flemish part of the population.The general situation in the country is becoming less settled owing to the continued industrial depression, and there have been small strikes among the metal workers and builders in different districts. The revolu-tionary element in the country notably &quot; les Amis de 1&apos;Exploite &quot; has made a certain amount of capital out of the Russo-Polish situation, and there is a growing desire for peace with Soviet Russia in industrial circles. The Antwerp Federation of Transport Workers refused to load French war material for the Poles and threatened to organise a general strike if the Government did not recognise its decision.-
ITALY.Conditions in Italy remain unsettled and the situation in that country is described as &quot; rather like sitting on a volcano.&quot; Professional agitators are as usual making as much capital as possible out of the agrarian and economic difficulties of the moment, and considerable Bolshevik propa-ganda is being carried on. It is suspected that large funds for this latter purpose are in the possession of Michael Vodovosov, whom Litvinoff has appointed as his representative in Italy for the repatriation of Russian war prisoners. Vodovosov is a persona grata with the Italian Socialists, especially in Milan, and is suspected by the Italian police of financing the revolutionary movement.The strikes at Milan in the factories and among the metal workers, although ostensibly due to economic reasons, appear to have a political object, and the Minister of Labour admits that the action of the workers indicates a spread of Bolshevik tendencies.   Factories have been seized by the men, who force the technical staffs to work day and night in shifts. At various establishments the Red Flag has been hoisted and, although up to the present time order has been maintained, the situation may become critical when food supplies run short and the strikers&apos; money begins to fail.  The declared object of the Confederazione Generale del Lavoro makes it clear that revolutionary trouble cannot be avoided.   Its aim is not to effect a better relationship between employer and employed, but to bring about the abolition of all private ownership, one of its fairly recent orders of the day against any form of profit-sharing makes this clear.   The Council of the Federation in this order declares that profit-sharing is dangerous to the aims of the movement of resistance, and that representation of the workers on boards of administration only tends to collaboration with the employers, which is fatal to a complete control of production.   In spite of the object lessons which they are daily receiving of the effects of Bolshevik intrigues and of the utter unreliability of Bolshevik promises, Count Sforza, the Italian Foreign Minister, recently informed a deputation of Socialists that he was willing to negotiate with the Soviet representative, Vorovski.   He stated, however, that he could not accept Litvinoff as a Bolshevik emissary as he had been expelled from Gireat Britain and- was generally considered undesirable by the Allies.   There are no doubt domestic political reasons for the attitude of the Italian Government towards Bolshevism, as it would appear to be essential for its continued existence to retain the assistance of the Socialists if the reports that the Catholics intend to withdraw their support from Giolitti can be relied upon.d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s agent in Rome, Cesare Rivanera, who is an Italian born in Egypt, is displaying considerable activity. He is in close touch with the Egyptian Delegation in Paris.spain.Although at the special congress of the Socialist Party held at Madrid in June it was. decided that the party should join the Third International, the leaders of the party, Priets, Perez, Molina, Garcia, and others, were successful in imposing certain important reservations upon the Extremists. One of these reservations, namely, the decision that the Socialist Party shall continue to take part in Parliamentary proceedings has especially annoyed the adherents of the Soviet system. The result of this failure of the Socialists to adhere absolutely to the ruling of the Third International is that the party is still divided and it is probable
that soouer or later the more violent of its members will secede altogether from tho party and form a separate Communist Party. After several months of comparative calm in Barcelona, the injudicious policy of the new Civil Governor in releasing the imprisoned Syndicalist loaders has led to a recrudescence of agitation in that town. The Syndicates have begun to reorganise, and strenuous efforts are being made to intimidate working men in order to induce them to join up and pay their contribu-tions. A large proportion of the industrial classes is reported to bo quite satisfied with the present rate of wages and to be ready to work peacefully, but a state of terrorism is being worked up by the agitators by means of the assassination of workmen who refuse to join the Syndicates, and a strenuous propaganda is being carried on among them. The Employers&apos; Federation is doing its best to secure the dismissal of the Civil Governor, and a Royal Decree has been issued to suspend trial by jury in the province of Barcelona. Past experience has shown that if only strong repressive measures are adopted, there is a cessation of social disorder. At present, however, the authorities both in Barcelona and Madrid are displaying considerable weakness, and it is impossible to forecast what the results of this policy will be.CANARY ISLANDS.. The strike among the fruit workers in Oratava lias now ended, the strikers having returned to work, and fruit to the value of about 100,000/. is in transit for the English market. It was thought possible that the strikers were in communication with the Transport Workers Federation in London and Liverpool.PORTUGAL.There seems to be little difference in the policies of the various parties in Portugal. The constant changes of Government are due to the personal ambitions of the different leaders or to the intrigues of the many political groups. The labour unrest continues, and lis attributed to the fact that the present Government is credited with Bolshevik tendencies. Popoff, the Russian Charge d&apos; Affaires, is believed to have considerable influence, and to be financing the Bolshevik movement in France, Spain, and Portugal. Maximalist Committees have been organised in Oporto and other towns, and considerable revolutionary propaganda is being carried on.2. SCANDINAVIAN GOUNTRD3S. NORWAY.It is generally considered that there is little chance of a social revolution taking place in Norway. The Extremists realise that the Government is well prepared and that public opinion is against them, At the same time it is clear that moderate counsels will not prevail in industrial disputes in the near future. The employment of direct action must be expected and the economic outlook is not satisfactory. The Bolshevik Commissar at Murmansk is reported to have given Tranmel a guarantee that in the event of a general strike the Soviet Government will support the workers for one month, and there is little doubt that much of the present unrest is being fostered by Bolshevik agents. The attempts to revive trade with Russia continue, but the experience of the directors of the Norwegian fisheries, who were among the first to urge the
Government to resume commercial relations with tho Bolsheviks, cannot have given much encouragement to other business people. Helped by the Finn Marken Bank the Northern Norwegian Union of Fisheries organised the exportation of fish to Archangel. Upon tho arrival of the first consignment, valued at kr. 1,000,000, the Bolshevik Commissar took possession not only of the fish but also of some of the boats which carried the fish. Mo paid cash down, but in Soviet money, the result being that the bank lost kr. 630,000 on the transaction.SWEDEN.Reports have been received to tho effect that the relations between the Swedish Government and the Soviet Government have recently been rather strained. The latter is credited with having considered the advisability of sending an army to the assistance of the Poles. The German ambassador in Sweden has stated that in the event of hostilities between Sweden and Russia, Germany would remain neutral, but would continue to encourage trade relations with the Russians.Stockholm is the Scandinavian headquarters of the Communist International Organisation, which includes an Indian and Islamic department, a department for dealing with reports received from the United Kingdom via, Norway, and also a department which acts as a distributing agency for propaganda sent from Moscow and Berlin. Zeta Hoeglund and the editors of Folheviljan and Solidaridet are members of the Secretariat. A Sub-Secretariat is to be opened at Christiauia in view of the increasing business in conformity with the wishes of the Norwegian Extremists. It is believed that some of the recent consign-ments of gold from Russia are earmarked for this purpose.A minor misunderstanding among the Swedish Extremists has been reported. It is said that Strom is anxious to adopt a less subservient attitude towards Soviet Russia, but that the Left Socialist leaders, such as Einar Ljungberg, Carlsson, and Kihlbom, are in favour of strict adherence to all instructions from Moscow.DENMARK.Litvinoff continues to assert that the Soviet representatives in Europe are forbidden by the Moscow authorities to interfere in the domestic politics of the countries to which they are sent. Kilbom, the Swedish Bolshevik, who has recently had two interviews with Litvinoff, intends to make a tour in Denmark in order to hold conferences upon the Bolshevik movement. Litvinoff himself left Copenhagen for Christiania as soon as he had concluded his negotiations with Austria concerning the repatriation of prisoners of war.The Danish Socialists remain firmly attached to the Second Inter-national, and recent developments in British and French Extremist circles do not appear to have influenced them. They are sympathetic however towards the Russian proletariat and stand for the recognition of the Soviet Government.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOLLAND.The opposition to the new Anti-Revolution law has ended in failure1, Troelstra having openly declared that he is disappointed with the results of the strike which he attempted to engineer.   It would appear that the
suggestion made in the last Monthly Report (No. 21), that the Dutch &quot;working classes are becoming tired of revolutionary agitation is a correct one. The International Anti-Militarist Congress which was to have been held at the Hague has been indefinitely postponed owing to dis-agreements among the Committee. In a message from.Moscow to tho Dutch Comrades, Wynkoop stated that the Western Secretariat of the Third International at Berlin was responsible for the abolishment of tho Amsterdam Sub-Bureau. It would seem that the Extremists at the present time are uncertain as to what, policy to adopt and are more concerned with their own differences of opinion than with a combined attack upon existing institutions. Jt is reported that tho total mem-membership of the Dutch Communist Party in April 1920 amounted to 2,700 members.GERMANY.Leading Independent Socialists in Germany a short time ago were con-vinced that the German Government was anxious, without violating the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, to re-establish economic and diplomatic relations with the Bolsheviks. This information was obtained during the period of the successful advance of the Red Armies in Poland. At that time all the parties in Germany were watching events and calculating upon the effects of the capture of Warsaw by the Bolsheviks. Troops were being sent to East Prussia, and the majority of the counter-revolutionary officers who were implicated in Kapp&apos;s attempted coup (l&apos;etat were in that region. Several of them, indeed, were reported to be in communi-cation with the Bolsheviks. The German military leaders, who had no great belief in the military value of the Red Annies, were probably mainly anxious to use the approach of the Russians to German territory as an excuse for keeping under arms the men of the Reichswehr and the Volunteer troops who should have been dispersed by the terms of, the Spa Agreement, though naturally they were ready to seize a favour-able opportunity of restoring their military prestige. The German Communists, on the other hand, entered into direct relations with the Bolsheviks, and were counting upon a Russian success to assist them in their revolutionary programme in Germany.The successes of the Red Army undoubtedly gave a great impetus to Bolshevik activity in Berlin, and it is reported that many German Communists actually went to Russia to join the Eed Labour Army, and were then drafted into the Red Armies. In this connection it is interesting to note that Victor Kopp, the Bolshevik representative in Berlin, informed the Communist and Independent Socialist Committees which were dealing with the question of the emigration of 100,000 German workmen to Soviet Russia, that the scheme could only be considered by the Moscow authorities if the workmen agreed to serve in the Red Armies if required to do so. It is early yet to estimate the effect of the collapse of the Bolshevik offensive, but it will probably have a sobering effect upon revolutionary agitation in Germany.At the present time, however, the Extremists in Germany are as active as ever, and are supported by the Bolsheviks, for, in spite of the assurance which was given by the Moscow authorities that their agents should not interfere in the internal affairs of Germany, the German Government is in the possession of documents which show the continued activities of the Soviet Governments agents in Germany. The German Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs has definite proofs that funds were supplied from Moscow in support of the disturbances which took place in the Ruhr.district last April.   Russian roubles and other valuables are
being sent into Germany, where they aro changed into German currency at tho Darmstadter Bank in Berlin and employed in propaganda and for other purposes. As an oxample of the use to which Russian money is employed, it is stated that the Red Army in Hamburg, the strength of which is estimated at 40,000 men, each of whom receives 25 marks a day, is paid by Litvinoff. The Bolsheviks are also reported to have established a new information bureau in Berlin, to which they have assigned 20,000,000 roubles for propaganda work and the fomenting of agitation. They undoubtedly maintain a considerable staff in Berlin for these purposes.. Among their agents there is Dr. Hermann Gorter, who is reported to be the chief adviser of the Soviet Government on Irish matters. He is said to be advising Tchitcherin to give every possible assistance to the Irish revolutionaries.The leaders of the K.A.P.D. (National Communist Party) are still endeavouring to join the Third International, but the nationalism of this organisation is a stumbling block which at present has not been surmounted. The Moscow authorities have called upon the leaders of the K.A.P.D. to merge with the Spartakusbund, which the former have refused to do, preferring to maintain their separate organisation. The Bolsheviks also assert that Rasch, one of the leaders of the K.A.P.D., is an agent of the&apos; German Staff, and that the whole party is infested with agents provocateurs. This may be the case, as negotiations have been reported between the K.A.P.D. and the military party in Germany, Wolfheim, the Hamburg leader of the Communist Party, being the representative of the K.A.P.D.The Hamburg Group was contemplating the advisability of entering into direct communication with the Soviet Government with a view to obtaining its co-operation in the formation of a Soviet Republic in Germany had the overthrow of Poland been effected.The attempts of the Bolsheviks to promote trade relationship with Germany still continue.It is reliably reported that Litvinoff is carrying out negotiations with &quot; Das Vereiu der Deutschen Eisen und Textil Industrien&quot; for the foundation of a Russian-German Clearing House either at Berlin or Copenhagen. This clearing house is to be organised under the form of Russian-German Bank, and is to be used for promoting trade between Germany and Soviet Russia. Attempts are being made through the agency of Hellberg, the Swedish Bolshevik, to send a German technical delegation to Russia to assist in the construction of new gasworks which are to be built by Delbruck, Schichler &amp; Co.The various activities of Herr Hugo Stinnes deserves close attention. His object apparently is to discredit the Republic as much as possible with the ultimate object of restoring the Monarchy in Germany. For this purpose he is said to be financing the Deutsche Wirtschaftshilfe, a revolutionary organisation, the policy of which is to propagate informa-tion with a view to securing a revision of the Treaty of Versailles. He is also one of the principal supporters of the Altmann and Zeissenitz News Agency, which is responsible for the emanation of most of the biassed or entirely false news which is now in circulation in Germany. Its chief aims are to foment agitation against disarmament, against republican institutions, and to endeavour to cause friction between the Entente countries. The promotion of a German-Russian alliance, in order that a non-Bolshevik Germany may lead a Bolshevik Russia to economic reconstruction is also said to be one of the chief objects of this agency. Stinnes is probably working in collusion with the old German General Staff, which still exists under the leadership of Ludendorff, who, however, carefully keeps in the background.   The plan seems to be to
keep as many officers as possible in employment and within reach. With this object in view Stinnes is using a number of staff&apos; officers in his various industrial operations. If rumours are to be believed, a new &quot;Putsch &quot; is in active preparation, and it is considered that, if such an attempt is to take place, it may be timed to take place as soon as the harvest has been gathered. The influence of Stinnes over the industrial community may have considerable effect in such an event.SWITZERLAND.Bolshevik propaganda is still busy in Switzerland, but there is nothing to show that it is being attended with any success. At a recent congress of the Swiss Socialist Party the Communist G-raben&apos;s motion in favour of a reconstruction International was defeated, and a motion put forward by Grimm in favour of sending a delegation to Russia for the Third International was accepted. This policy, however, is being opposed by Humbert Droz, who represents the Left Section of the Party, which is now in a minority. Platten and others are reported to be busy trying to effect a fusion between the various sections of the Communist Party, but up to the present their efforts do not appear to have been attended with much success. The &quot; Bieler Vorwarts,&quot; which hitherto has been the leading journal of the Swiss Communist Party, is no longer to be published. The ostensible reason for this is alleged to be lack of financial support, but the true reason would appear to be that the Extremists consider that the money employed in the publica-tion of the newspaper would be more usefully expended in promoting industrial disturbances.A certain Samuel F. Darwin Fox, who was expelled from Switzerland last May on account of his Bolshevik activities, and is now employed on the staff of the Clarte Group in Paris, is reported to have recently been corresponding with Jean Debritt of &quot;La Feuille.&quot; He is trying to obtain the support both of Irish and Egyptian agitators in Paris in the interests of &quot;La Feuille,&quot; which, be hopes, may become a journal of world-wide importance. -AUSTRIA.According to an agreement signed in July by Litvinoff on behalf of the Russian Soviet Government and Paul Richter, Chairman of the Austrian Commission for the Repatriation of Prisoners, Austria not only declared herself neutral, but also agreed not to allow the passage of munitions through her territories which might be used against the Soviet Government. Another clause of the same agreement permitted both Russian and Austrian prisoners to remain in the country of their former captivity if they so desired. This clause is considered favourable to the propagation of Bolshevik ideas in Austria. The appearance in Vienna of Bronski, who, until recently, was conducting the business of the Third International in Berlin, is also a proof of the interest which the Russian Soviet Government is now displaying in Austrian affairs. He is os-tensibly discussing the exchange of prisoners, but it is thought that he is entrusted with more important negotiations.The German, Austrian, Polish, and Hungarian delegates of the Zionist Socialists at Vienna have decided to join the Third International, and to agitate against every kind of Capitalist undertaking in Palestine. They have decided that Jews who go to Palestine are to be saturated with Communistic ideas, and the Jewish workmen in Palestine have beeu invited to form Soviets.   The Soviet Government in Russia is
reported to bo supplying funds for the printing in Yiddish and Arabic of a quantity of Bolshevik literature for circulation in Palestine and Arabia.HUNGARY.The negotiations- between the Hungarian Government and the delegates from the International League of Trade Unions with regard to the boycott do not appear to be making much headway. This is scarcely surprising in view of the fact that the Government cannot afford to make concessions which might lead to further attempts at International direct action against Hungary. That such attempts are to be feared is borne out by a remark attributed to the Communist leader, Dr. Friedlander, who urged the importance of carrying out successfully the blockade against Hungary in order that later on a similar blockade might be prepared against Poland, and any other country opposed to Soviet Russia. Mean-while a report from a Communist Committee at Budapest which has been received in Stockholm states that the Whites have succeeded in raising the workmen&apos;s blockade in Hungary, and are expediting the despatch of merchandise.Reports which were received earlier in the summer to the effect that German Monarchists were in touch with the military party in Budapest do not appear to be without foundation. Ivan Hejjaz is the main leader of the officers&apos; detachments in Hungary, the policy of which is violently reactionary and anti-Jewish. The officers who are members of these detachments are mostly serving in the Hungarian National Army, and their methods are said to be similar to those of the Sinn Feiners. Admiral Horthy has endeavoured to suppress the movement, but not with much success.Crops in Hungary are above the average, and, as all export of them is in the hands of the Government, the exchange should be materially improved by the foreign sales of cereals.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.The Communist movement is reported to be gaining ground in the mining and industrial districts, and the reason for this is attributed to the shortage of food aud other economic difficulties. On the whole, however, Bolshevik propaganda does not appear to have made much progress in the country. Teschen, which is a bridge between the Russian Com-munists and those of Western Europe, is said to be the centre of revolutionary tendencies. The Czecho-Slovakian Communist General on bis return from Russia recently stated that it would take 10 years for Communism to be accepted in Russia, and a hundred years for it to be accepted in Czecho-Slovakia. On the strength of this prophecy he was elected to represent his party at the Conference of the Third International at Moscow.4. RUSSIA AND BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.The following speech by Lenin at a meeting held on the 28th of July in Moscow to discuss the future policy of Soviet Russia is worthy of attention as illustrating the views of the Bolsheviks with regard to the present European situation.   Lenin is reported to have said : li Without wishing to mix myself up with the strategic plans of the Superior Council of Defence, without wishing to impose on it my views,
I think, in spite of the news of Chicheriu, that we shall be able to come to an understanding with England. France is the only obstruction to the recognition of the Soviets and the conclusion of peace.&quot; French Imperialism is the mortal enemy of Democracy and the Socialism of Europe. It is easy to foretell that disagreement will come between France and England.   .   .   .&quot; The interests of the two countries are too divergent. It would be dangerous to consider France as an enemy to be despised. By her tenacity France has overcome Germany. Millerand continues the policy of Clemenceau, and gives proof in our respect of the tenacity of which his predecessor gave proof in respect of Germany. France intrigues in Hungary, Roumania, Czeeho-Slovakia, Yugo-Slavia, everywhere where she finds an echo of her Imperialist aspirations. She well knows that the day that Poland ceases to exist the Treaty of Versailles is in danger, and she wishes to save herself and her work, which is the Treaty.&quot;I do not think that the Entente and Germany will come to an agreement over Russia. The hatred of France for Germany blinds her statesmen, and they prefer to lead their couutry to the abyss than accord any concessions to Germany. Have we not also to fear the former, who for some time openly worked with us? We ought to beware of any military action against Hungary and roumania, and, anyhow, not give these countries any pretext to attack us ; it is better to work them with propaganda. We have already met in this regard with appreciable results in Czecho-Slovakia and Yugo-Slavia. Turkey is with us and Bulgaria dare not betray Russia anew.&quot;It is in foiling these intrigues that we shall give France a terrible blow. We shall disarm her by offering Poland a relatively advantageous peace.&quot; My advice is that we ought to conclude peace even with the actual Polish Government.&quot; It is ueeless to try and overthrow it by force. Two or three months after the signing of peace Poland will be ripe for revolution, as is actually the casein Esthonia. This will give us time to re-establish ourselves, to disarm Poland, to give our peasants time to gather the harvest, and to see what we shall be able to do with Poland and Prussia.&quot; I maintain that the world revolution is inevitable, but it must be carried out with intelligence and sagacity.&quot;Lenin&apos;s views no doubt repiesentthe official Bolshevik conception of policy, but a report that the Third International proposes to continue its activities, independently of any treaties which may hereafter be signed by Soviet Russia and any Capitalist States, is worthy of attention. Even if diplomatic and economic relations are resumed with the Bolsheviks therefore there is no guarantee that the activities of the revolutionary Extremists will cease.Economic.There are no signs of any economic revival in Soviet Russia. It is reported that production in the first six months of 1920 fell 50 per cent, on the corresponding period in 1919, Of the 50,000 workmen at Saratov only 5,000 are left, and all textile and other industries in that district and in the Volga Basin have practically ceased to exist. The Baltic Shipbuilding Works, a firm which used to employ thousands of men, now only employs 1,740, and NobePs Engineering Works only 280 men. In January 1918 33,022 men were employed at 17 of the Nationalised Works ; in June 1920 the number,employed was only 6,742. In January 1918 56,169 men were employed in 173 private works; in
June 1920 tho number was reduced to 11,266. Tho cost of living con-tinues to rise. Without the authority of a commissar it is said to be impossible to buy anything whatsoever, and, even if this help is forth-coming, there is little to buy. Bread at the end of July was priced at 6,000 roubles per lb. and sugar at 5,000 roubles.In the country districts of Russia there is a great demand for salt. In many places it is said to be being used as currency. The salt factories are producing nothing owing to the lack of coal. Krassin informed a newspaper correspondent at Gothenburg on the 31st of July that this year&apos;s harvest in Russia would be below the average owing to the protracted drought, but that the old stock would save the situation during the coming winter, by when the transport services would be much improved. Reports, however, tend to prove that his view of the transport improvements was rather optimistic, although great efforts are undoubtedly being made to repair the Northern Railway to Siberia, which is regarded as the main food route of Soviet Russia.The peasants in Russia continue to take as little notice as possible of the Soviet authorities and pay little attention to their decrees. Their dislike for the industrial population does not seem to diminish, and they only cultivate as much land as is sufficient to satisfy their own wants.A growing restlessness against the Soviet regime is again repprted from Petrograd, and recently there have been frequent crimes of violence committed against Jews. Searches and arrests have consequently once more become the order of the day. The Government has started a new campaign against the Revolutionary Socialists, and a price is said to have been placed on the head of Tchernov on the ground that he gave an unfavourable impression of the Soviet regime to the British delegates, Turner and Snowden. It is worthy of note that the Social Revo-lutionaries have now decided to use all possible means to introduce themselves into Government circles in order to try and induce the Bolsheyiks to practise Socialist principles.An Anarchist anti-Bolshevik plot is reported to have been discovered towards the end of July. Attempts were to have been made on the lives of Lenin, Zinovieff, Bukharin, and others. Several of the ring-leaders of this conspiracy were arrested, and the Bolsheviks did their best to keep the matter secret. It is said that Krassin was approached by the conspirators and asked to oust Trotsky from power and to do away with Bolshevism. He is reported to have declined to &quot;accept the invitation, saying that &quot; he could not break his word.&quot;Propaganda.It is reported that the Soviet Government is disinclined to expend any more funds on propaganda in Scandinavia, Holland, Spain, and Italy. On the other hand, large sums are to be spent on propaganda in France. This propaganda is to be directed from a small town in the south of Germany, near the Swiss frontier, and also from London. G-anetzky-Furstenburg, formerly director of the State Bank at Moscow, who was responsible for supplying propaganda agents with money, has now been appointed to a position in the Commissariat for Foreign Commerce, and is to be sent to Copenhagen. He has also been designated as Chief of the Control of Propaganda for Poland.The effectiveness of their propaganda is now seriously exercising the minds of the Bolsheviks. Communications between Moscow and the United States of America is considered unsatisfactory and new methods and routes are to be employed.In Bohemia they have,, a well-organised system of propaganda, but Maxa, who was considered by President Masaryk as the most dangerous
Bolshevik in Prague, has been removed and made Ambassador at Tho Hague.&apos; Gorman influences in Moscow arc reported to bo increasing, and three Germans recommended by Krassin have been invited by tho President of the Superior Economic Council to collaborate with the Soviet Government with a view to tho re-establishment of economic conditions in Russia. Representatives of many of the principal German commercial firms have been brought into the country, and property belonging to German firms which was sequestrated during the war has been returned to their owners.In Southern Russia the power of the Bolsheviks is reported to be oidy nominal, being maintained only in the towns and along the railway lines.. The. struggle in this part of the country has begun to assume Ilie character of a union between the peasantry and the border population against tho urban and workmen&apos;s centres of Northern Russia. WiangePs army is now said to bo an organised force and looting and pogroms have ceased. It is acquiring the character of a national army, not merely a peasant movement. The Bolsheviks have attempted to undermine the moral of Wrangol&apos;s troops by propaganda, but, so far, with little result.,Prices have, of course, risen enormously in South Russia largely owing to the return, of large numbers of refugees, and also owing to the fact that Wrangel refuses to risk alienating the peasants by requisitioning grain. From the economic standpoint his position is largely dependent upon foreign help. The withdrawal of the British mission has had the unfortunate effect of leaving the field clear for the Germans, and several of the pro-British commanders have been replaced&apos; by others with German tendencies. Neither Wrangel himself nor his Prime Minister, Krivoshein, are favourably disposed towards the Germans, but the situation is such that they may be compelled to adopt a pro-German policy. Without military assistance in the shape of supplies there does not appear to be much chance of wrangel&apos;s army being able to hold back the Bolsheviks should they attack in force. The Russian Monarchist League, which has its headquarters at Sevastopol, and has branches at Moscow, Berlin, and Constantinople, has begun to play a political role. Many of wrangel&apos;s officers belong to it and, although it is supposed to be a non-party organisation, it is credited with distinctly Germanophile tendencies. The League derives its financial support from the Extreme Right elements of wrangel&apos;s army and from the land-owning class in the Crimea. Its policy is to restore a Constitutional Monarchy in Russia.In the Ukraine Makhno, who is conducting a guerilla war against the Bolsheviks, is reported to be making great progress. He is supported by the peasants mainly because he does not rob them or mobilise them. His chief centres are Ekaterinoslow and Alexandrovsk. His army appears to be short of officers and consists of volunteers, deserters, and tramps, who are attracted by the prospect of adventure and booty. Wrangel is reported to have estimated that it would require an army of 30,000 men to suppress Makhno&apos;s operations.,FINLAND.A centre Social Democratic group has been formed in Finland which appears.to have a certain following, especially in the Tammerfors rnanu-facturing district. This group appears to be anti-Communist. Trade Unions in Finland are well organised, and the workmen&apos;s parties haveO  12334 p
IBconsiderable power. Committees are formed on tbo various district councils and exorcise a control over them. Thus the Helsingfors town council is entirely in Communist hands, and has agreed to join the Third International, although the leadership of the Council is ostonsibly in tho hands of the Socialist Party. The Workmen&apos;s Gymnastic League, which is suspected of working for tho Red Guards, the Socialist Democratic Teetotallers League, and the Young Finnish League are all Communist organisations. The Young Social Democratic League is shortly to decide whether it will join the Young International, and tho Finnish Social Democratic Party has &quot; dc facto&quot; though not &quot; dejure&quot; retired from the Second International. In spite, however, of the advanced views of these bodies, it is reported that the relations between employers and employed in Finland are good, and there seems no reason to suppose that the in-fluence of the Bolsheviks is making much real progress among the. people.Baltic States. ESTHONIA.Goukousky and other Bolskevik agents in Esthonia are very active at the present time and are carrying on Bolshevik propaganda among the industrial population. As a result of this, and of the general economic condition, considerable unrest undoubtedly prevails, of which the Ex-tremists in Esthonia as in other countries endeavour to avail themselves for their own purposes. A short time ago the Esthonian Government was reported to be extremely unpopular among the people, and it was thought that the approaching elections might bring about a serious crisis in the relations of the country with Soviet Russia. More recently, however,, the Government seems to have succeeded in regaining its control over the country, and it is considered that it has the situation well in hand. The railway strike which was engineered with Bolshevik money failed, and it is thought that the Esthoniau Army would be ready to resist any Bolshevik aggression. The people are not inclined towards Communism. It is estimated that quite 60 per cent, of the industrial population of Reval is white, and the workmen are beginning to under-stand that it is useless for them to demand increases of wages if food prices rise in proportion. They are, therefore, beginning to agitate for protection against the increased cost of living rather than for higher wages.LATVIA.The Government leans chiefly on the peasant farmers, who form the strongest group in the Assembly. These peasants, however, do not form an absolute majority and consequently the Government is compelled to seek the support either of the Socialists or of the National Bourgeoisie minorities.POLAND.In spite of a scheme for the prohibition of imports, imports arc increasing whilst exports are steadily diminishing. Poland exists on internal and foreign credits. Her total debt in July was estimated at 40 milliards of Polish marks. The Ministry of Finance has reserved to itself the right of levying a compulsory loan on incomes above 36,000 Polish marks.There will be no surplus of cereals for export, but, if conditions arc favourable, there should be several thousand tons of sugar, some potatoes, and a certain amount of lumber for export.
The Communists in Warsaw remained quiot during tho Russian advance and Trotsky openly declared that no reliance could he placed on help from the Communist Party in that town. There is no doubt, however, that tlie success which at first attended tho Bolshevik advance was largely due to tho conflicting political opinions which prevail among the population and tho army.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.BULGARIA. The Growth of Communistic Ideas.While organised Communism in Bulgaria does not seem to have got beyond the &quot; Council of Action&quot; stage, Communistic ideas are undoubtedly spreading in all classes. The new &quot; Idealistic &quot; Communists in Bulgaria have among their uumhers as many members from the landed and wealthy classes as from the peasants and proletariat. The Bulgarian, though by blood loss than half a Slav, is still very &quot; Slavonic &quot; in tem-perament, in the sense that he is apt to be led away by sweeping generalities. Bolshevik promises are high-sounding and appear at present to have got the ear of their Bulgarian supporters, to the detriment of their usually rather terre a terre common sense. Though Bulgarian Communism is still a town product, it would be a mistake to suppose the peasantry and the larger country proprietors (where these exist) are unaffected.Organised Communism.Organised Communism exists among the working classes. There are Communes of dock labourers, transport workers, and railwaymen, headed by Commissars who direct tho organisations with unmistakeable authority. These Communes, favouring as they do the nationalisation of industry and extreme Socialistic doctrines, are alien to the existing Trade Unions. While not openly hostile to the Government, they are being worked upon by Bolshevik propaganda. Communications with Soviet Russia are openly maintained through the port of Varna, and propaganda pamphlets, &amp;c, are imported in great bulk by&apos;that way.The Army.The Bulgarian Army, though by no means the strict Prussian military weapon of former days, is still reported to be fairly well disciplined as things go. Sentries in the port of Varna are said to be unreliable, bribable, and not over loyal.The Labour Army.The Bulgarian Labour Army, which is under the Ministry of Ways and Communications, will be organised into some 10 or so districts, each supplying a regiment of about 3,000 men, who will be collected into barracks for three or four.months&apos; training. each regiment will specialise according to the particular needs of its district. For instance, in Pleven, which is principally a corn growing district, and in Philipoppolis, which produces rice and is at the same time industrial, technical training will involve the manipulation of modern machinery, both industrial and agricultural. Increased production of the necessaries of life and then the improvement of communication, draining of marshes, &amp;c, are to be the objectives of this new army. Work is expected to start in the early spring of next year, and the main idea is that Bulgaria should learu to be 2
satisfy all her own requirements so as to become independent of foreign imports.That the matter has passed far beyond the&quot; Russian&quot; stago is shown both by the system of enrolment modelled upon the systems of compulsory service in normal armies and in the fact that the question of a uniform is being considered. There will be a working dress and a full parado dress, and Colonel Gantcheff, an extremely intelligent and energetic staff officer of the Bulgarian Army, has been placed in command. How far the army is intended to maintain the spirit of discipline for future military requiro-ments it would be difficult to say, but there is no doubt that the Bulgarian General Staff have considered this aspect of the question.JUGO-SLAVIA.The Prince Regent Alexander appears to be extremely popular, and the people are confident that ho will redeem the Slav territories now in the possession of foreigners. It is thought that as soon as the Govern-ment has the army ready, it will call upon the Italians to compel D&apos;Annunzio to leave Fiume. The Italians and also the French are extremely unpopular in Serbia. The cereal crop in Jugo-Slavia is reported to be a very good one, and its value is estimated at about 35 milliards of French francs.*ROUMANIA.The position of the Averescu Government is reported to be somewhat precarious owing to the increasing strength of the Opposition, which is composed of the Federation (United Socialists), the Extreme Agrarians, and tho Nationalists. The fact that the Intellectuals and Illiterates now have equal electoral rights has largely increased the strength of the Federation as its programme, which is frankly communistic, appeals both to the industrial and agricultural workers. The Socialist Paity in Roumania has largely increased its membership during the past year, and has considerable funds at its disposal which it is reported are supplemented by money from Moscow. The Bolsheviks have sent a secret Communist delegation to Kishineff, under the direction of a Roumanian called Panarescu, who has been trained at the Moscow Academy of Propaganda. This mission has received instructions to establish a permanent connec-tion between the Russians and Roumanian Extremists, and to carry on active propaganda among the peasants. A raid was recently carried out at the Socialist headquarters in Bucharest, and a large quantity of Roumanian Bank notes was discovered. These notes were identified as some that had been sent in 1917 to Moscow for safe keeping. It had long been suspected that the Socialists were in the pay of the Bolsheviks, but they had always denied the accusation. It is thought that the discovery of the notes will do much to discredit the Party.GREECE.The success of the military operations in Asia Minor appears to have had the effect of creating a more friendly feeling in the two political camps in Greece. The ever-increasing justification of the Venizelist policy has probably done much to convince the opposition that their platform is a weak one. The knowledge that Great Britain will not recognise King Constantino as the head of any Allied or friendly State
has had a marked effect on the Constantino Party, whoso prospects are now considered hopeloss. For the time being tho English seem extremely popular in Greece, and there is a great demand for English education. There is, however, considerable German propaganda, which is carried on by Herr Mariel, the unofficial German representative. German clubs and schools are being re-opeued, and great use is being made of German governesses, of whom about 40 are being employed by Herr Mariel. At present tho import of German goods is limited, but the Levant Line proposes shortly to import large quantities of manufactured articles from Germany.The Communists in Greece do not appear to be making much progress, but they hope to establish &quot; One Big Union&quot; by means of the formation of Factory Councils. This scheme is to be applied, not only to industrial trades, but also to agriculture, tho railways, &amp;c. It is intended that the &quot;One Big Union &quot; shall work in conjunction with the Communist Party. Benaroya is the originator of this scheme, but it is considered unlikely that it will meet with any large measure of success.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.Reports as to the condition of affairs in Turkey are conflicting. It is probable, however, that the Nationalist Party in Anatolia under Mustapha Kemal is meeting with many difficulties, and the recent successes of the Greeks have considerably diminished his prestige. The failure of the Bolsheviks in Poland has no doubt prevented them from sending Mustapha Kemal the support which they are reported to have promised him, and his position is far less strong than it was. The intrigues of the Nationalists in Switzerland continue, and Enver Pasha is said to be returning to Turkey to take command of a force based on Batum.PERSIA.The Persian Government is reported to have instructed its Miuister at Rome to enter into direct relations with the Soviet Government in Russia.Persian Nationalist propaganda in Switzerland has recently assumed a more serious aspect under the direction of W. Lytten, late German Consul at Teheran. This propaganda is financed by John de Kay&apos;s League of Oppressed Peoples. In his pamphlets Lytten portrays the Persians as having actually no sympathy with the Bolsheviks, their only bond of union with them being their mutual hatred of the British.ARMENIA.The conclusion of peace between Armenia and Soviet Russia marks the removal of the final obstacle to the direct linking up of the Red troops of Soviet Azerbaijan with the forces of Mustapha Kcmal.The present agreement is only a preliminary one ; further negotiations are to be carried on at Erivan, which means the presence of Bolshevik plenipotentiaries and a strong escort within the Armenian capital, whereby a Bolshevik coup (Petat may be effected resulting in the establishment&apos; of a Soviet Armenia.Armenia occupied, the position of Georgia becomes one full of danger, and doubts arise whether she will not find surrounding influences too
strong for her present Government. If Georgia goes lied tho barrier between Soviet Russia and Anatolia has disappeared. In this connection it should bo noted that permission lias been given to the Georgian Government for the representatives of the Georgian delegation headed by Makharadze to start on their journey to Moscow, the Soviet guaranteeing their safe arrival.EGYPT.The trial of Abdel Rahman Fahmy is not exciting as much interest among the general public as might have been expected, partly because he has many enemies and partly because he is suspected of having em-bezzled funds belonging to the Delegation. Among the student class there has been a certain amount of excitement, but owing to the trial taking place in vacation time no great trouble has been caused.The disputes between the Syrians and the French have also failed to produce much excitement in Egypt. The cause of such unrest as there exists among the poorer classes is mainly due to economic causes, and, while there is no actual proof of Bolshevik activity in Egypt, there is evidence that the word. Bolshevism is acquiring political strength as symbolising some sort of revolutionary movement against the richer classes. This movement is directed more against the wealthier Egyptians, who are suspected of hoarding grain and exacting heavy rents, rather than against the British, whose efforts to reduce prices by the importation of grain are recognised.It is reported that Egyptians in Switzerland have openly stated that they have the full support of the Italian Government in their efforts to obtain independence, and that detailed arrangements have been made in Rome for the supply of arms which are to be shipped, to Egypt in submarines.7. FAR EASTERN STATES. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.Azerbaijan.The reign of terror continues, and the population is said to be too much cowed to think seriously of any rebellion against the Bolsheviks. Supreme power is in the hands of the Commissars, backed by the Red Army under the command of Levandarsky. The Tartars are opposed to the Russians, and look to Nuri Pasha as their sole hope of salvation. In Baku the working classes are said to be already disillusioned with Boi-shevik administration. Work ceased on the oilfields in July, and a rising of the population had to be forcibly suppressed by the Red troops.Bokhara.It is reported that the Young Bokharan Party is endeavouring to engineer a coup diktat to overthrow the Emir. There is already a rumour emanating from Moscow that the coup has been successful, and that Bokhara has become a Soviet Republic.Georgia.German influence is reported to be strong in Georgia at the present time. This is attributed to the fact that when the Germans evacuated the country they left a number of officers and non-commissioned officers in Tiflis arid other districts, who either joined the Georgian Army or entered commercial life. All these German soldiers are now engaged on pro-German propaganda, which is mainly directed against Great Britain,
Turkestan.The economic situation shows little sign of improvement. The Communists have destroyed all trade and private enterprise. Schools under Turkish teachers have been established to inculcate Communistic doctrines, which, however, are not popular among the Moslem population.The Tashkent propaganda school continues to turn out a large supply of trained agitators for work in India and tho East generally. They are said to represent all classes and to be well supplied with money.JAPAN.It is reported that in Japan the prestige of Germany is practically as high now as before the war. German is being taught in the higher and middle schools, whereas up to a year ago only English was taught. There is no reason to suppose, however, that tho alliance with Great Britain is unpopular, on the contrary, all classes in Japan are anxious to emphasise their regard for the English.Several people have recently been arrested in Japan and imprisoned in connection with the publication of Bolshevik pamphlets which were originally dropped among Japanese troops in Siberia. The leaflets dealt largely with the oppression of Koreans by the Japanese, and were directed against the Mikado and his Government.SIBERIA.It is understood that an agreement has been reached between Moscow and the Japanese Government by which the Far-Eastern Republic is to be recognised and to be free to negotiate with foreign powers.The Japanese will give no further assistance to General Semenoff, and all their troops are to be evacuated from the Republic, which guarantees not to permit the entry of Soviet troops into the country and the personal safety of Japanese subjects living within its territory. The Foreign Minister is at present in Moscow consolidating his position.Conditions in the interior of Siberia are terrible ; 80,000 deaths from typhus have been reported from two towns alone, and there is considerable shortage of food.Order is being kept in the towns by terrorism, and it is understood that the Russian Orthodox Church is engineering an anti-Semitic move-ment amongst the Monarchists, assisted by degenerate and reactionary officers. This would appear to be nothing more than the old regime of provocation, which always tried to turn the hatred of the masses from the bureaucrats on to an innocent and neutral people.8. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.The Communist Labour Party is anxious to extend its activities in Canada and has received a welcome from many of the most active revolutionary leaders. During a public debate which took place in Winnipeg in August on the subject of the One Big Union versus the
International principle, W. II. Hoop of tlio &quot; Western Labour News&quot; declared that the O.B.U. meant revolution, and that the general strike in Winnipeg was definitely intended to lead to a revolution.There are indications that there is co-operation between the Ex-treinists in Western Canada and those in Great Britain. It is rumoured that liaison work is now being attempted by Robertson, the Glasgow agitator, who is still living quietly in Eastern Canada, die was &quot;a student &quot; of the Labour College in Glasgow, and is possibly working in connection with the Labour College in New York, which is financed by the Russian Soviet Bureau. Anti-Christian propaganda seems to be a leading part of the revolutionary programme in Canada, and in Montreal is especially directed against the Roman Catholic Church. Violent anti-British propaganda is being employed by the Hearst newspapers circulated in Canada. Hearst literature is largely blamed for the recent revolu-tionary outbreaks in Winnipeg and Vancouver.The first commercial representative of the Russian Soviet Govem-ment recently reached Montreal from New York. He is reported already to have placed an order&apos;on behalf of his Government with Canadian syudicate amounting to five million dollars, and to expect to place other large orders. It is proposed eventually to establish a permanent Russian commercial bureau in Canada. The One Big Union was instrumental in promoting numerous strikes in August, a few only of which have been settled up to the present time. A general strike of longshoremen along the whole Pacific Coast is planned to begin on the 1st of October. The Halifax shipyard strike was &quot; officially settled &quot; on the coinpauy&apos;s terms oil the 11th August. The cause of Unionism in Halifax is considered to have suffered a severe reverse; the unions concerned in the strike are reported to have lost two-fifths of their strength.AUSTRALIA.A number of important industries in Australia are threatened with serious dislocation owing to the action of-their employees, who refuse to work on Saturdays. In. spite of the action of the employers in refusing to employ men on the following Monday who have absented themselves on the previous Saturday, the engineers, boilermakers, and the men in various other branches of the iron trade in Sydney, including electrical workers, persist in their refusal to work on Saturdays. As a result, the employers in the dockyards have declined to employ men who will not work for 48 hours in the week.A scheme which was put forward by the Trade Union delegates at Sydney on the 23rd of August, recommending the dislocation of industries by a &quot; go slow &quot; policy, is reported to have been repudiated by the Executive Committee of the Australian Labour Party, and this plan is also repudiated by the Party&apos;s official newspapers on the .ground that it would reduce the poor to literal starvation.The opinion of advanced Labour circles in Australia, as expressed in their organ the &quot; Brisbane Standard,&quot; is that the political and economic changes advocated. .by the Labour Party are in no way affected by the fact of Australia^ connection with the British Empire. It is contended that social and economic reforms can be obtained constitutionally under a Limited Monarchy just as well as under a Republican form of Govern-ment. * / . ...SOUTH AFRICA.The International Socialist League is the fountain head of Bolshevism in South Africa.   Bolshevism is reported to be on the increase in Cape
Town, Johannesburg, Kimbcrley, and Durban. Other centres do not appear to bo so much affected, and up to tho present time no serious attempt has been made by the Extremists to influence the coloured population, although Bolshevik literature insists upon the political and social equality of tho natives. Russian Jews are said to bo the principal movers in the Bolshevik agitation.Strikes arc still of frequent occurrence, particularly in the mining area.WEST INDIES.Branch associations of &quot;Tho Universal Negro Improvement Associa-tion,&quot; which has been declared illegal in the United States of America, are being formed in the West Indies. It is possible that the whole of the movement which this Association advocates may have been inaugurated by the Germans, and it is probably still supported by German-Americans. The &quot; Constitution and Book of Laws&quot; of the Association is cleverly composed and is dangerous because it is aimed in the main against the existing American Government, and is designed to foment racial trouble in the United States and in the British possessions. The movement so far, however, has not met with much support from the negro population either in the United States or the West Indies. The reason which is attributed for this failure is rather pathetic From time immemorial the coloured population has disliked to be described as &quot; negro &quot; and prefers to be called &quot; Creole,&quot; a large proportion of the coloured population having European or Mexican blood in its veins. Curiously, enough these people are proud.of their^nixed descent and are excessively annoyed at being classed as negroes by their would-be emancipators. It appears probable, therefore, that, if the movement is unopposed by the Government and treated tactfully, it will die a natural death, at any rate in the West Indies.9. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Through the efforts of George Hardy a resolution was adopted at the 1920 Convention of the I.W.W. at Chicago, by which the I.W.W. of the United States of America is practically affiliated with the British Shop Stewards System, and thus connects the American organisation with the Marine Transport Workers of Great Britain. At this Convention the I.W.W. also pledged itself to stand by the Third International and to support the Soviet Government in Russia. George Hardy is the leader of the party in the I.W.W., which is in favour of participation in revolu-tionary movements in foreign countries. He is a close confederate of Jim Larkin, who is now serving a five years&apos; sentence in New York.Twenty members of the American Communist Labour Party, including William Lloyd, a wealthy Chicago firebraud, have been sentenced in Chicago to various terms of imprisonment, ranging from a year to five years for plotting to set up Soviets in the United States. The New York editor of Class Struggle, who helped to draft the constitution of the Communist Labour Party, was among those convicted. Part of the prisoners&apos;plan to obt&amp;in money for the overthrow of the Government was to dynamite the banks and the vaults of trust companies. The trial lasted 85 days, two months being occupied merely in selecting theThe Convention of the Communist Party discussed the question of bringing Louis C. Fraina back from Holland to the United States. He is an able writer and well acquainted with International Communism.
It is thought that he would bo useful in keeping together tho American Communists, who at present are much divided.As a result of a referendum vote, the Socialist Party of tho United States has endorsed the Third International with certain reservations. Another vote, however, resulted in a declaration against the &quot; dictator-ship of the proletariat&quot; as practised in Russia.Tho increasing number of unauthorised strikes is causing some anxiety to the American Federation of Labour, and a notification has been sent by the Federation to all local Trade Union authorities that to aid any such strikes will involve the loss of their charters. In spite of this warning local strikes continue The anthracite miners, although warned by their president that they must honourably observe the decision of the Wages Board which granted them an increase of wages of 17 per cent., struck for a wage increase of 27 per ceut. Most of the mines were still closed in the middle of August, but the men are now reported to be returning to work. The tramway system in New York was recently paralysed by a strike. The strikers resorted to sabotage and spiked the air brakes and broke the emergency door mechanism on many cars. The Longshoremen&apos;s Union is once more on the war-path, and is said to be determined &quot; to bring Great Britain to her knees.&quot; About 3,000 members of the Union in New York and Boston have gone on strike, and refuse to load, or to unload, British ships until Archbishop Mannix is allowed to go to Ireland, Mr. McSwiney is released, and British troops are withdrawn from Ireland. The executive of the Union has repudiated this strike as the men are said to be breaking their ugree-meut with their employers without any just grievance. Various other new strikes were reported in August involving about 40,000 men; 204 other strikes were then in progress affecting about 175,000 men.Conditions in the coalfields are extremely unsatisfactory. In Illinois alone in. August it is reported that 363 out of a total of 375 mines were idle as a result of strikes. In Kentucky and Pike county the sheriff was unable to handle the situation and was obliged to call in military assistance. In West Virginia the State Constabulary had to be sum-moned to preserve order. The coal shortage in the. middle of August amounted to 25,000,000 tons.At a recent convention in New York at which Marcus G-arvey presided 15,000 American citizens of African descent &quot; pledged their sacred blood to free Africa.&quot;. Messages of sympathy were sent to de Valera and the Zionists in Palestine. It is reported that many of the leaders of this bellicose negro movement come from Jamaica. An organisation for the co-ordination of all negro societies has been formed under the title of the &quot; Allied Labour Federation of America.&quot; A negro lawyer of Galveston, one A. G. Parkins, is one of the principal organisers of this movement. The Galveston negroes are reported to be the most turbulent in Texas, and anti-racial feeling is running high in that State. The Socialist Party is carrying on vigorous propaganda among the negro workers in New York, and the Bolsheviks are reported to be planning an active campaign among the negroes in the United States as part of their general campaign among the coloured races. This campaign is expected to emanate from Mexico. -Martens is becoming very intimate with th* Hindus in New York and has had several conferences with Sailendra Nath Ghose. The members present at a Russian meeting recently were instructed to stand by the Hindus in every case.In the United States it would seem that Sinn Fein is genuinely anxious for .a simple and immediate settlement of the Irish question. De Valera is reported to be ready to arrive at an agreement which would
Zguarantee the safeguards for Great Britain and Ulster laid down by Mr. Lloyd George. Meanwhile, however, the Sinn Fein &quot; Parliament&apos;&apos; has authorised do Valera to spend considerable sums on anti-British propaganda, and Irish agitators are doing their best to bring about a quarrel between the British and American Governments.German propaganda continues and two German social societies are to bo converted into bodies which will take an active part in politics. An attempt is to be made to organise the German voters and their friends and sympathisers into a political factor at elections. John Alexander, alias Lagranch, an alleged International Anarchist and member of the German Communist party, who has been distributing German propaganda in tho United States, was recently arrested by tho police.10. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.It is reported that much unrest prevails in Santa Fe, where the industrial population is well armed and dominated by Spanish Com-munists. A general strike has been declared. Some of the unions have refused to stop work, but it is feared that the railway workers will be affected. The strikers demand a reduction in the cost of living and the liberation of prisoners arrested in connection with previous labour troubles.The Argentine authorities do not appear to view with much favour the colonisation scheme which is being put forward by the Deutsch Volhsbund fur Argentinian. Three German delegates who have been negotiating for the purchase of land are returning to Germany to report upon their investigations. It is understood that their proposal is to place upon the land 150 German families, each with a capital of 40,000 to 50,000 dollars, to be employed either in agriculture or some other form of industry.CHILE.Bolshevik pamphlets are being circulated in the southern portion of Chile.   They apparently emanate from Buenos Aires.MEXICO.   .The industrial situation in Mexico continues to be serious and is aggravated by foolish promises made by the various candidates for political office. Economic reasons are not, however, entirely responsible for the labour agitation in Tampico, which is reported to have been due to foreign agitators who incited the workmen to take control of the petroleum industry. Labour demands were conceded by the companies in the belief that refusal would only assist the advance of Bolshevism.Government officials continue to deny the existence of Bolshevism in Mexico, but Goles and similar periodicals continue to advocate the forcible overthrow of the existing form of government and the institution of a Soviet republic.The Communists are making capital out of the industrial and political confusion in the country. In the State of Hidalgo it is reported that the people in many towns are taking forcible possession of the.surrounding haciendas.
PART II,1. RUSSIAN CO-OPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS AND SMALL AGRICULTURAL CREDITS ; PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.A new era opened for Russia with the abolition of serfdom in .1861 and the establishment of self-government in 1864. The new condition demanded a revision of the mode of living. When the economic life of the people was no longer exclusively an affair for the landowners, a scheme for the creation of small credits had to bo developed. Tho old State bank had entirely ignored small agricultural credits, and this did no particular harm to the large landowner, but the small yeoman, and still more the peasant, could not progress without some source from which they might borrow while avoiding moneylenders.All the efforts of &quot; literary&quot; reformers of the peasantry in the way of organising churches and schools and bookhinderies did nothing to attack this serious economic problem. Government circles were interested only when the peasants emigrated, but paid no attention to their economic condition. Private initiative first attacked the problem. Mr. S. T. Luchinin in 1865 established a village loans and savings partnership of the type begun in Germany by Schultze-Delitsch, and still earlier in Scotland by the Rev. John Duncan. These efforts attracted the attention of the Government. In 1867 the Ministry of Finance, in agreement with the Ministry of Home Affairs, established more of these institutions .for the granting of small credits to the peasants.Gradually, in the 35 years between 1865 and 1900, about 3,000 peasant loans and savings partnerships were established, with a combined capital of about 25 million roubles. A.bout 500 peasant banks were also formed, with a joint capital of about 10 million roubles.The very gradual expansion of the system must be attributed to the fact that the old Government clung obstinately to the Mir or village commune, in which they saw an obstacle to the development of a peasant proletariat. And the village commune sapped the basis of individual interest. No peasant was going to do much to improve a small strip of land which might soon pass into someone else&apos;s possession. The new system suffered also from the fact that, under the old, the more energetic men were leaving the villages and flocking into the cities to engage in industry, aud encountered obstacles in Bureaucratic delays and in restric-tions on the part of the State bank in granting the preliminary capital.In 1900, however, restrictions on the communes were abolished and private joint stock banks also began to lend money to the partnership associations. From the peasantry men of ability began to spring, who, with a natural aptitude for business, began to open loans to the peasants. The latter came to have confidence in their hauks and to deposit their savings in them. With the increase of deposits the banks began to increase the number of their loans. They soon became irading cdrpora-tions and formed trusts which developed into the.Co-operatives. Naturally the development was greatest iD the regions where peasant industries had gone farthest.Then came the Bolshevik revolution,For some time the Bolsheviks did not venture to attack the Co-opera-tive Associations,&apos; which, however, had not had time to grow absolutely independent of the State.   Even the Soviet Governments nationalisation
of joint stock companies and banks did not at first prevent the&apos; Associa-tions from obtaining advances from the Grovornmont on condition that they paid a certain indemnity to it.In November 1919 the Government, which had been growing intolerant of anything pertaining to individual initiative, and which for long had found that the training in care and accuracy in regard to their private dealings which these banks gave tho peasants was antagonistic to Communist teaching, began to interfere. The Soviet Authorities found that in places -Avhere the Co-operatives wore best developed the population believed in the destruction of tho land of the landowners, and were little affected by the agitation of the Bolsheviks. If Russia had been really covered with a network of such partnerships, the Government would not have been able to grasp the power as they did.The Bolsheviks then attacked the Peasant Partnerships aDcl destroyed them. It is believed, however, that they are not dead, but that as soon as there is a rovival in Russia they will be the first things to spring up. The Bolsheviks&apos; destruction of trading and commercial machinery has led to speculation era masse, and Russia is now full of persons who, at risk of their lives, transport food and munitions to the cities, where they dispose of them at enormous prices.The Bolsheviks at first prosecuted these pedlars, but later they recognised that they were an essential means of transport and allowed them to enter the cities. There is, indeed, some chance that, with the establishment of commercial machinery and a return to normal economic life, these pedlars, having seen something of the world outside their own small town or village, will take up positions in the commercial world as commercial scouts, and will tour round the villages in search of stores of produce and material which they will either purchase or secure by barter for the cities and their employers. When regular trade is re-established it must, not neglect this new class of men who have been created and who now constitute an army carrying on barter, buying and selling, meeting every day with many adventures at some risk even to their lives. To take advantage of their services the large industries and banks would have to establish branches throughout Russia. Aud the peasants&apos; savings and loan partnerships may become these brauches.Peasant partnerships might be restarted by capital from the private large stock banks in the cities and industrial centres, such banks, that is, as are sound and do not speculate, a tendency which almost wrecked Russian banking circles during the last years of the old regime. Care will have to be taken in transforming the present Co-operatives into branches of the larger joint stock banks that all the. Co-operative Societies shall function alike, and they shall not lose their original character of small land associations. It is probable that the Bolshevik nationalisation of the Co-operatives will be found to have operated in favour of uniformity, but simultaneously against the retention of individuality. For these branch institutions when revived must have certain liberties; they must be able to buy on their own account for the members of the Co-operative, for the local population and even for export and import; further, they must have the right to their own depots or stock houses for the storage of goods bought on their own accouut for members of the association, for the local population, and for goods against which the bank may grant loans. This is especially important. It will favour the development of Peasant Industries, which will not only occupy the peasants during the mouths when agriculture is at a standstill, but teach them to take advantage of whatever natural resources may be at their door. Under the old regime the Imperial government and private initiative paid a great deal of attention to Peasant Industries, but they
would not grant the peasants sufficient advances or supply sufficient raw material or help enough in tho disposal of their products.Tho Imperial Government only sent agents to tho villages twico a year, which meant that the peasant had to wait six months before he could receive further credit to carry on his work. This, quito irrespective of the fleecing of the peasantry in vogue during the old regime.Tho present condition of transport in Russia makes it especially urgent that some such scheme should be taken up and carried out. The few places, like Moscow, which still produce something, will find it impossible to supply all Russia. Only some such system of peasant industries can in any wider sense revive industry and make the vast continent of Russia prosperous and contented.2. A GERMAN REVOLUTIONARY CENTRE IN SWITZERLAND.During the latter part of the war tho name of Hanshubort Freiherr von Durant de Senegas was well known to tho counter-espionage services of the Entente, as the organising head of a German agency foi sabotage, espionage, and the fomenting of revolution in the Entente countries and their colonies.The name of M. le Chef d&apos;escadron Baron de Durant de Senegas appears in a confidential publication by the Swiss Government dated July 1919 as an unofficial attache of the German chauccllerie in Switzer-land.The two are identical, and, though he dropped out of sight for a time after the revolution, that he has again resumed his activities is made clear by a number of letters obtained in Switzerland between the autumn of 1919 and the middle of May 1920.Von Durant is the active head of the agency, which is at present situated at Wollishofen Seestrasse, 513, Zurich, a Chemical laboratory, owned by one Diesser, a German officer. The second-in-command is a certain Director Kaufmann, who lives at Basle, and who is the end of a chain that runs from Lugano and Zurich and via Basle to Berlin and Frankfurt, where reside von Durant&apos;s chiefs, a Count Brockdorf Rantzau in Berlin, and one Horwitz in Frankfurt, who is possibly identical with a well-known Bolshevik of the same name who was in Zurich in 1918, and who later disappeared.The attached chart, based upon the letters, shows the communications and organisation of the agency, so far as is known.Behind Brockdorf Rantzau stand the leading German reactionaries and the Heavy Industrials, and also the &quot; proper Russian people,&quot; who last year promised the Count financial and moral help, conditional on their spreading Bolshevik propaganda in certain countries.In close liaison in Berlin with Brockdorf Rantzau is the Communist Arbeiterpartei,,that dissident Nationalist branch of the Communist party to which Kopp, the Bolshevik representative in Berlin, recently gave half the propaganda money he received from Moscow. There is ample evidence that this organisation is in close touch with well-known former espionage systems in Switzerland, for in one of the letters von Durant states that &quot; the Hilfsbund and Hilfsverein are now ready to help us by word or deed.&quot;Both these associations are exclusively used as propaganda and information services in the Gorman interest.In Switzerland itself von Durant&apos;s service appears to have been mainly concerned in the intrigue against the League of Nations, and in the bomb outrage last April against the American Consulate at Zurich, the latter demonstrably directed by von Durant, who got the perpetrators of the affair safely away into Italy.   He has been responsible for a great

deal of propaganda against the League by means of forged letters to the Swiss daily papers and publications, and aimed, as a last resort, at a general strike of Swiss workers to prevent Switzerland having anything to do with tho League of Nations.There are traces of his activity last winter at Swiss health resorts amongst English people staying at these places, where he aimed especially at persons with German sympathies or German wives whom he hoped to win over as agents, conscious or otherwise, in countries not otherwise accessible.His organisation has been heard of in Canada, Egypt, and India.In Canada he has been reviving tho relics of war-time organisation. The director of one of them, Count Potocki, has apparently disappeared, and a certain amount of anxiety is displayed in the letters concerning his whereabouts. His Indian organisation is insurrectionary. In October 1919 he sent two agents to India, an Italian and an Englishman. The latter travelled in 1J.S.A. and Japan. The delivery of munitions and weapons to India seems to have been arranged through the Frankfort organisation in contact with the Japanese Legation in Berlin. Arms, ammunition, and machine guns were to go to India with the connivance of a highly placed official in the Japanese Legation, and Dr. Solf, the new German Minister, is known to have received ample authorisation and money for those purchases.Solf is shown by the letters to have stayed before proceeding to Japan with a certain Baron von Alvensleben, who was also in connection with von Durant at Lugano. Von Durant has obviously friends in Italy who help him and a certain Herr Liebliug (whom it has not been possible to identify and who acts in Switzerland as von Durant&apos;s agent in Lugano, and as Dr. Kaufman&apos;s agent on the German-Swiss frontier) by passing their agents through Italy to their final destination, usually disguised as theatrical artistes. Successful co-oporation with the Italians is mentioned, and there is special interest in his close connection with them in view of the accumulating evidence of Italian complicity with Indian, Egyptian, and Turkish revolutionaries.3. GERMAN HEAVY INDUSTRIALS, REACTIONARIES AND SPARTACISTS, AND THE RED ADVANCE UPON POLAND.The Spa Conference, which bulked so largely in the Entente view of German affairs, is reported to have aroused curiously little comment or excitement among the general public in Germany, who have been far more taken up with the subterranean movements now coming to a head as a result of the intrigues of the last few months.The progress of events during these months falls under two headings, the campaign against Bolshevism and the campaign for the obliteration of Poland. One thing so far is certain, that the whole of Germany, Communist, Bourgeois, Capitalist or Reactionary, is united in.any action which will save Poland from annihilation. This determination is not aimed at France. Feeling against France is undoubtedly high, but the heavy Industrials do not see eye to eye either with the Reactionaries or with the Spartacists in the matter of immediate revenge on France, Their triple agreement as to the necessity of the elimination of Poland is the more remarkable and is worth studying from their different points of view.The relative weight and influence of the Heavy Industrials and of the Government may be gauged by the fact that Stinnes&apos; presence at Spa, though he was not in the Government, was in German eyes of more importance than all the acts and arguments of the German officials and representatives there. The German Government, which has, on the whole,
been loyal in its intention to carry out tho Peace Terms, is handicapped by the legacy of corrupt officials left them by Erzborger and his associates who betray them at every turn to tho Heavy Industrials and Reactionaries. The Heavy Industrials are the &quot; Under-rulors&quot; of Germany. Their policy is the rejuvenation of Germany with the subordinate assistance of Russia. The policy of the Soviet regimo has, of course, been its counterpart, viz., the rejuvenation of Russia with the assistance of Germany and England, but with Russia as senior partner. But for Poland absolute co-operation between the Gorman Heavy Industrials and Reactionaries and the lied Armies would be possible. With Poland prostrate the only question is whether Russia should go into Germany or Germany go into Russia. Russians and Gorman &quot; Under-rulers &quot; vie in scheming as to which party shall hang the other over tho corpse of Poland.The preparations of the &quot; Under-rulors&quot; in Germany consist of a careful watch over Bolshevist preparations in Germany ; the establishment of German officers throughout the Red Armies, and the setting up of a force in East Prussia, Lithuania, Lettland, and also in the Ukraine, where the Ehrhardt Brigado is reported to have offered itself for service. The. Heavy Industrials want to see the work of German hands established and Germany economically strong before they turn upon France or any of their late enemies. They will not allow themselves to be rushed. Tho war of Capital versus Labour has to be won first.For the Reactionaries, of course, a war of revenge, the winning back of Alsace-Lorraine and other territories lost, and tho re-establishment of the old Germany come first. The Reactionaries know that the Heavy Industrials hold the purse strings. As regards the progress of the Red Armies to the borders of Germany, the points which their policy has in common with the latter are : (1) The necessity for co-operation with Russia. The Reactionaries want the help of Russian man power as a fighting force against common enemies. The Heavy Industrials want Russian raw material. Both want to get rid of the Soviet regime. But raw material is of such importance to the Industrials that the Soviet Government answers to the description of what they require. A Russian Labour Army working profitably is the ideal of the German &quot; Under-rulers.&quot; The Reactionaries and Heavy Industrials have a common agency in the Secret German General Staff with its registers of available man power in Germany, and skeleton formations of platoons, companies, battalions, regiments, &amp;c., throughout the country.(2) It is their further common policy to bait the German Spartacists into such actions as may end in their suppression by the troops of the Reactionaries united to the legitimate forces of law and order, thereby obtaining both kudos for the Reactionaries and simultaneously intimidating Labour. This policy, however, appears to be temporarily in abeyance in East Prussia, where Reactionaries and Spartacists are united under the term of the &quot; German Red Army &quot; for local reasons.While Reactionaries and Industrials stand on common ground in the campaign both against Bolshevism and for the obliteration of Poland, the Spartacists, in alliance with Victor Kopp, the Soviet representative in Berlin, though they face the other way, also stand on common ground with them as regards the latter object, but not, of course, as regards the former.
The Bolsheviks, through Victor Kopp, have steadily been making plans to help the Red Armies as soon as they reach the German frontier. Flans have been laid to corrupt railwayinen, blow up stores of amrnuni-tioii, seize the Danzig corridor and galvanise into a fighting force of some sort the Russian prisoners of war, whose tone and morale in the various war camps are reported greatly to have improved, though with a strongly Bolshevik trend.The position, therefore, as regards Poland is full of anxiety. Poland is a nuisance and an enemy from the point of view both of the Soviet regime, the German Reactionaries, the German Heavy Industrials and the Spartacists. As the advance of the Red Armies continues the position becomes more acute. On the Soviet side telegrams in Kopp&apos;s office in Berlin are said to show that both Krassin and Kopp are against the Russian army entering Germany and have urged the Soviet Govern-ment to prevent this, but that Trotsky has announced his intention of continuing his advance. The attitude of the local Bolsheviks in Berlin appears consistently to have been that Russia should make no attempt to force herself upon Germany, but allow Germany to form her own Soviet as an equal ally.Meanwhile it is curious to note how rapidly the advancing Russian Army has dropped its epithet of &quot; Red.&quot; In its rapid advance it is even said to have been &quot;losing&quot; its Commissars. Reports have come of Russian cavalry exchanging friendly greetings with the old British troops and that units of the Bolshevik Army have been seen near the German frontier flying the old Russian National colours. It would appear that the main hopes. of the German leaders rest on their belief that Trotsky, by declaring the Polish war to be a Russian one, grasps a two-edged sword and that his P.ed Army is losing its tinge of scarlet.4. THE SOVIET TERMS TO POLAND.In a Wireless message from Moscow dated 11th August, which was intercepted and appeared in the Times on 17th August, the following phrase occurred : &quot;While it is acknowledged that the clause demanding &quot; the arming of workers is unprecedented in history, it is felt that such &quot; action is necessary to guarantee the rights of the Polish proletariat &quot; and the safety of Russia, at the same time providing that a militia &quot; is adequate for national defence which it is impossible to use for &quot; Imperialistic ends.&quot;.This phrase the Times rightly comments on as signifying the application to Poland of the clause regarding the arming of the Proletariat in the 3rd International. It has now been found possible to compare the Soviet terms to Poland as despatched from the Foreign Office at Moscow to tho Delegation in London on 5th August with the Note of these terms handed by M. Kameneff to Mr. Lloyd George on 10th August.The terms,&quot; rather dramatically handed to Mr. Lloyd George at the end of his speech in the House of Commons on 10th August, were seized upon (as was intended by the Soviet Authorities who arranged for their appearance at the psychological moment), by representatives of Labour all over this country as extremely generous and as absolutely disposing of any necessity to go to war for the sake of Poland. The text transmitted by M. Kameneff to Mr. Lloyd George specifies the limitation of the numbers of the Polish Army and the administrative staff, demobilisation of the Army and war industries, the surrender to0 12334 0
Russia of all arms over and above such as may be required for the reduced army and a civic militia, the refusal of admission into Poland of troops or war material from abroad, the right of free transit, and the full disposal of the line Bolkovysk-Bielostok-Grajevo. Under Clause 7 it promises that the families of all Polisli citizens killed, wounded or incapacitated i?i the war shall he given lands free. Under subsequent clauses it likewise promises the departure of the Russian armies from the Polish front; the maintenance at a considerably reduced figure of a number of Russian troops on the Russian frontier ; an armistice line no further east than that laid down by Lord Curzon, from which the Polisli Army is to withdraw and leave a neutral zone of 50 versts ; and a final boundary line for Poland practically coinciding with Lord curzon&apos;s line but giving Poland more to the east of Bielstok and Cholro. Such are the terms as delivered by the Russian Delegates to Mr. Lloyd George and simultaneously published by them in the Daily Herald.Comparison with the instructions forwarded from Moscow to M. Kameneff, which is now possible, shows that from the terms as handed to Mr. Lloyd George one important clause has been omitted, and one seriously garbled. Both these clauses are among the conditions imposed upon Poland. The first relates to the arming of the Polish workers under the control of the representatives of the Trade Unions; this clause was quite openly published in Moscow on 11th August, a. day after &quot; the terms&quot; were handed to Mr. Lloyd George. The clause, of course, means neither more nor less than the application to Poland of the clause regarding the arming of the Proletariat which stands in the programme of the 3rd International as to be applied to all countries not already Sovietised, in the interim between the upsetting of their capitalist government and the substitution for it of a Communist regime.The clause garbled in the Note as delivered to the British Prime Minister is No. 7, relating to land for families of Polish citizens killed, wounded or incapacitated during the war. This clause in the published terms says that all such families shall be given lands free. As sent from Moscow it bore a very different and far more sinister meaning. It stipulated on behalf of Russia for the free disposal (by that country) of the land of families of Poles killed, wounded, and incapacitated for work. In other words, the clause lays down that such lands in Poland shall be transferred to the Soviet Government.&apos;There can be no doubt as to the meaning of this stipulation. It means neither more nor less than the Russian colonisation of Poland. Taken together, the omitted and the garbled clauses between them provide for tke arming of Poles, Polish Jeivs, and the riff-raff of the population generally who are willing to sacrifice their country to Russia, and for the &quot;plantation&quot; in Poland of Russian Communists upon lands whose owners are no longer able to defend or to cultivate them.- The procedure of. Messrs. Kameneff and Krassin with regard to the Note is fairly clear. They received their instructions from Tchitcherin several clays before Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech in the House of Commons. These instructions were held up until Mr. Lloyd George was actually making that speech on August 10th ; they were then simultaneously handed to him and published in the Daily Herald, the subsidised organ in London of the Soviet Authorities. Both as given to Mr. Lloyd George and as published in the Daily Herald they omitted the important clause regarding the arming of the Proletariat workmen, and seriously garbled, so as completely to pervert its meaning, the clause regarding the disposal of the land of families of incapacitated Poles.   These omissions and
alterations make the Note, as handed by M. &quot;Kameneff to Mr. Lloyd George, a deception grosser than Bismarck&apos;s perversion of the Ems Note of 1870. Its transmission to Mr. Lloyd George and publication in the Herald some days after its receipt by the Russian Delegates makes it quite clear that it was altered in shape and carefully timed so as to serve as a striking anti-climax to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech, which the Soviet Authorities greatly feared.The Daily Herald was, of course, jubilant, and in its issues of Thursday, August 12th, and Friday, August 13th, it commented joyously on &quot;Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s misfortune in speaking just too soon.&quot;Printed by eteb and SroiTiswooDT3, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.c.
