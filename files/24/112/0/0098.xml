52^ALL GJ^ (P 7637)nrirnm^nl is the Pioperty. of ::oiv&apos;8 Government.... -i lift 1 ,&apos;1 11&quot;&quot;from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, &apos;   ldth October 1920.   &apos;      &apos;4499(Received 20th, 8 a.m.)Clear the.line.&apos;; 1214 S. year telegram,.of 4th October, 22$4. Afghanistan. In light of changed circumstances indicated in our telegram of, 15th October, 1201 J3., and of latest news from authentic sources, the Afghan agreement with Bolsheviks may be .on verge of ratification. It seems improbable that there will be any conflict over Bokhara question between Afghans and Bolsheviks in near future. There.is no need therefore for immediate decision regarding possible request, by Afghans for gift of arms. We would point out, however, that we&apos;did not suggest, in our telegram of the 24th September, No.J139 S., assistance in anything else .than machine guns and rifles, which is less extensive than assistance contemplated by you. Principle enunciated by last sentence of your telegram under reply seems to call for immediate comments. We admit that we cannot allow Afghanistan to evade obligation towards us which she would incur by signature of agreement on lines of Mussoorie (? aide memoire)namely obligation to keep Russian agitators from our frontier and the like. But sentence referred to seems to imply that agreement with us should impose upon Afghans obligation to have no agreement or friendship with Bolsheviks and to derive no help from them. This is the position which it seems to us difficult to maintain. Trend of arguments used by our representatives at Mussoorie was that we should not object to Afghanistan deriving benefit from Bolsheviks provided that conditions of their (? grant) were not inconsistent with British interests. In this connection please see especially last paragraph of summary of remarks made byDobbs at fifth meeting Mussoorie (page 25 of Appendix to Dobbs&apos;Report). It seems likely that agreement with Bolsheviks now on verge of ratification at Moscow promises regular annual subsidy to Afghanistan and other benefits much on lines of British Afghan agreement contemplated by us. This attitude of Afghanistan in seeking advantage from both quarters while involving herself in (? obligation) directed against neither is perhaps not notably more indefensible than former attitude of Persia which used to receive loans and other help simultaneously from British and Russians. Contest in Afghanistan between us and Bolsheviks consequent on such, arrangement would doubtless be found inconvenient and might ultimately be. as embarrassing as was position in Persia before signature of Anglo-Russian Convention. But unless we go to war with Afghanistan to expel Bolshevik influence, a (? step) which would probably lead to war with Bolsheviks also, we now have to choose either aloofness from Afghanistan or participation with Bolsheviks in financing Afghan Government and developing country. Absolute aloofness would only lead ultimately to complete domination of Afghanistan by Bolshevik influence and abandonment of her neutrality, while our participation with Bolsheviks in her development should, owing to our superior economic strength and. facilities, attract her gradually to our sphere and in any event weaken her internal forces of fanaticism.We should doubtless greatly prefer exclusive domination of Afghanistan, but development of events has now made this impossible without war., and we consider that we must content ourselves with second best course indicated above and accept all its implications with our eyes open;-We clo not consider, therefore, that acceptance by Afghanistan of help from Bolsheviks, which we believe now inevitable, should preclude us from carrying out to end, if possible, programme laid down by us at Mussoorie.We would call your attention to probability that if we had forced Afghanistan at conclusion of last war to subordinate her foreign relations to us and exclude Bolsheviks, we should now be in a position of being obliged to aid her against Bolshevik military aggression which would certainly have been directed against her as outpost of British imperialism. This in present internal and external circumstances would have been( most embarrassing commitment. As things stand, so long as Afghanistan manages to maintain neutrality and fairly friendly relations with Bolsheviks without unfriendliness towards us, there is no danger of Bolshevik attack on her, and our. frontier problem will be mainly exclusion of propaganda instead of military defence against attack- on : northern Afghan frontier. However unsatisfactory, therefore, present situation may be, it is Jess so than if alternative policy had been followed. But we think, on further consideration, that before renewed discussion of agreement with Afghanistan, we ought to make quite sure whether she has actually signed an,agreement with Bolsheviks, and, if so, that it does not include provisions inconsistent with our interests.  We would,
therefore, add to conditions stated in our telegram of the 15th October, No. 1201 S., on which we would propose to accept AiiuYb invitation to send British Mission to Kabul following condition :-&quot;In-order that British Government may be satisfied that they can usefully conclude treaty of friendship with Afghan Government they wish to receive from Amir full and accurate information of terms of agreement already believed to have been concluded by Afghanistan with Soviet Government, and that if latter agreement includes provisions which British Government would consider unfriendly to Great Britain and which cannot be abrogated, further negotiations for treaty of friendship between Great Britain and Afghanistan would be unlikely to be successful. Grounds on which British Government base their belief that Afghanistan has already concluded an agreement with Soviet&apos;s Government&apos; are that on 23rd September Bolshevik representatives at Kabul received from Hopner, head of Bolshevik Foreign Relations at Tashkend, wireless telegram in clear language congratulating him on establishment of new and mighty relations between Independent Empire of Afghanistan and Soviet Republic of Russia, and this message was picked up by British wireless installation at Peshawar.&quot;Telegram referred to above was not repeated to London, as some doubts were felt here at time of its receipt regarding^object of its despatch in clear language. It will, however, now form convenient basis for putting enquiry to Amir.
