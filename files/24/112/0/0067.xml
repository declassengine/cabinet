It is estimated that over a million week? unemployment was jhrienced by the 38,026 persons In receipt of donation at 15th September.- 3 9 ,
The average duration for each person is 29 weeks, or about Beven months but a month&apos;s furlough ,should be deducted from this, making an average of about 6 months.   There is a great difference between the amount of.J^nemplgj ienjtjunonj? digabled as compared with non-disabled men? thus emphasising the difficulty experienced by the disabled man in securing or retaining employment as compared with the non-disabled man.   Among the disabled the average number of weeks of unemployment was 26 (or 22 not including furlough), while among the disabled it amounted to 40 weeks, (or 56 weeks excluding furlough).   A closer analysis of the figures shows that, excluding those dischar ed before the Armistice (for whom the information is not readily available), at least 50 per cent of the disabled men had been unemployment,ed f or more than half of the ^nmber^of weeks since their discharge, while in the case of non-disabled only about One-third had been unem-ployed to a similar extent.It may be observed that the highest percentages In the longest duration groups were among general labourers and in the transport trades which are mainly composed of unskilled labour. These trades also furnished the smallest percentage In the lowest duration  roups (under 10 weeks the building trades,which also Include a considerable proportion of unskilled labour, shows the next highest proportion in the high duration groups.In the following Table the figures are analysed according to length of unemployment and age groups

C. CHANGE op occupation.An analysis has been made of ihe occupations under which the largest numbers of persons are classified to determine the extent to which the men have changed their pre-war occupation.The Result Of this analysis is to shew a mar-red tendency to change from skilled to junskilled wprkj, and the post-service  i^ber. of^eneral   lab our ere particularly shows a large increase as compared with the pre-serviee number in the case of non-disabled.D.
