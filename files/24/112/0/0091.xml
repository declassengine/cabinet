llcport No. 1. dated 14.9.20.MESOPOTAMIA.CAUSES OF  UNREST.-REPORT No. II.By Majoe N. N. E. BEAY, if.C, Special Intelligence Officer attached to Political Department, India Office.In Report No. 1 it was shown how that early in November 1919, plans for the mutual co-operation of the C.D.P. Nationalists and Arab Government of Damascus were proposed by Talaat and accepted by representatives of the Arab Government of Damascus. The result was close co-operation between the Turkish Nationalists and the Arab extremists resulting in the unrest in Mesopotamia. It was pointed out, however, that the resultant hostile activities in the latter country formed part of a far wider scheme, inspired from the Eastern Dept. of the Berlin Foreign Office and the Moscow Government.It was impossible for this more ambitious scheme to be put into operation unless the concurrence of Mustafa Kemal was obtained, and he in turn received the support of the Arab party. The trouble in Mesopotamia was undoubtedly premature and was so brought about by the impatience of the Arab officers, Ajaimi Sa&apos;adun and the natural excitability of the tribesmen. It was shown how that the critical period in the Mesopotamian and Syrian situation was November, 1919. It is necessary now to trace in chronological order events taking place in other directions simultaneously with activities in Syria and Mesopatamia.wjjypl8 dated 2.3.20.y itw yRW CX/120533 dated 23.3.20. 32 dated 24.3.20. dated 8.9.20.HC/1293 dated 25.8.20.Enver Pasha, throughout December, 1919, was actively engaged in making supreme efforts to bring about an alliance between the C.U.P. Nationalists, Pan-Arabs, and Pan-Islamists and it was only when he was able to show Berlin and Moscow that he had good hopes of uniting these various political sections that he definitely received the support he was desirous of obtaining. Throughout November, and December, 1919, the greatest activity prevailed in Berlin, Switzerland, Italy, Turkey, Syria and Anatolia amongst the various political bodies to bring about an agreement between the various parties; in the first place with each other, and later with the Bolshevists  we may understand bow it was, therefore, that the Khilafat move-ment received little support in Switzerland. It was a question on which opinions might become divided and therefore prevent, through dissensions, an understanding being arrived at and in this respect it is interesting to note that Amie Feisal begs his father &quot; not to raise the question of the Khilafat which would cause a split between the Turks and Arabs&quot; (1093/HD/781 dated 3.6.20). In order to appreciate the insistence of this demand for unity on the part of Moscow a short review of Bolshevist Policy is necessary.* C.G.S. 1242 dated 5.5.20.C.G.S. 1596 dated 17.8.20.t 1242 dated 5.5.20 Moscow to Tash-kent Young Bkoharah Communists seek permission to organize Bok-harans in Turkestan to be used inthe event of a coup..........wethink it advisable........

It is, however, considered that in time &quot; the triumph of the proletariat must eventuate throughout the world,&quot; but it would appear to be a mistake to suppose that by seeking the re-opening of outside trade Russia is willing to live at peace with her neighbours even while conducting such negotiations her agents are actively employed in spreading her doctrines * to form a revolutionary party that will overthrow the existing Government, f whilst her efforts to create world unrest are ceaseless and effective. &quot; Opportunism as regards means is absolute in the Russian Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and does not exclude an alliance with oppositesj as a step to the dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;Lenin and his Commissariat of Military Affairs are therefore all for the &quot; international organizations of military forces, which, in case of need, would support any revolutionary movement.&quot;

In the briefest possible form she prepares the ground by intensive propaganda and then with a minimum force seeks to create an armed uphoaval using others as instruments.^ In this connection her main endeavours are centred in the Middle East with the avowed intention of crushing the British Empire.Her methods are worthy of the closest study in order to enable us to anticipate her actions.* o.o.c. mesopotamia x.101 dated 8.0.20.t g.h.q. mesopotamia x.101 dated 7.0.20.const. 17.7.20. ^(41) 19.4.20.37 8.7.20.w lht weekly report no. 22 dated 17.7.20.cx/676dg.8.9.20.ii &quot; bolshevik cojimittee formed in constantinople. composed of 15 members under management of 3. the committee has created a large number of sections in anatolia.&quot; persia &quot; formation of new pro-visional revolutionary committee of 2 completed (vinogadova to suritz).&quot; c.g.s. x.1594 dated 18.8.20.afghanistan. ccs. x.1662 dated 19.9.20.8 ccs. x.1242 dated 5.5.20.g ccs. simla x.1604 dated 10.8.20.8 cg.s.        x.1629 dated 1.9.20.Her chief aim is to bring the whole world under the communist system *; as a preliminary to this she is bent on destroying the power of Great Britain f in the East.

The general scheme of these societies is as follows. They arc necessarily very secret; a solemn oath is administered and the aath penalty threatened if this oath should be broken or the organization betrayed in any respect.f The central bodies are instituted in the towns % with branches in the villages As far as possible each member is to be armed ;U in actual practice this falls far short of what is desired for obvious reasons. She will not admit into her organization anybody that will not adhere to her Policy-g(5) In order to support and direct these societies consuls are appointed where possible as for instance in Afghanistan or previously in Bokhara or if these can not be established in the country itself or on its borders, then efforts are made to introduce trade or other delegates. These act as intermediaries between Moscow and the Societies, which have at their head a small committee* of the most trusted men responsible for the organization of the district societies which in their turn organize branches in every direction. It is most important to realize that their work goes on independently! of what the Diplomatic situation may be. Thus continuous work is in pro-gress amongst the local population to undermine ordered Govern-ment and create a highly organized &quot; army &quot;J of revolutionaries. As regards in particular her attack on Britain&apos;s position in the East she is making systematic efforts to obtain &quot; corridors &quot;lj into British spheres. The process has been gradual but sure. She is therefore disinclined to come to any agreement with any state that does not assure her these channels.il In all her agreements with states that might act as &quot; Buffers &quot; she encourages an exchange of &quot; Delegates &quot;$ whom she may &quot; convert &quot; and insists on having her representatives in the country with which she is negotiating in order that they may act as &quot; stations &quot; on her lines of penetration into British spheres.

Taking advantage of all local grievances and parties hostile to the existing regime, she seeks to convert them into revolutionary bodies linked up with Moscowf so that the &quot; brains &quot; of her central organization may direct their activities as a whole.002867 dated 15.6.20. c.g.s. 1256 dated 5.5 20* c.g.s. 1629 dated 1.9.20.Once having obtained a footing either by consular agents of Political Missions as in Afghanistan, or by military occupation as in North Persia, or a combination of the two as in Anatolia, she proceeds to consolidate and organize her position thus obtained and from these nuclei to again throw out her sinister tentacles which, groping about in every direction, seek to fasten themselves on local soil, into which their roots will strike, giving her a fresh grip of organized conspiracy ; and always in advance her countless propaganda agents creep, fostering any local discontent, preaching her doctrines, unsettling men&apos;s minds, weakening authority. Till self supporting revolutionary parties are created.*By the above methods she has approached nearer and nearer to her goal absorbing state after state on her way till to-day she stands on our borders, whilst Eritish influence has been gradually squeezed further and further southward ever narrowing the circle of her assault on our Eastern Empire.Organization must triumph over disunion in the end. Rebellions may occur, dissensions arise till finally unless an organized defence is opposed to this organized advance time will give the verdict to the latter.Russia&apos;s interests are self-centred ; she has not to consider this or that ally ; she is openly the enemy of civilization, as we understand it; she may seek breathing time by concluding agreements, or possibly make Peace with Poland and Wrangel, but it would be dan-dangerous to rely on this or that isolated factor to stay her progress. She herself acknowledges Islam to be contrary, nay hostile, to her programme, but unless Islam is organized to resist, instructed as to the truth, it will be powerless. Persia is hostile, for it is the hated Russian under a different mantle; yet Moscow has obtained a grip, t c.g.s x 1594 dated 17.8.20       a Revolutionary party has been formedfthat according to precedentmay become so organized as to overthrow the present regime. Turkey is hostile; yet the Nationalists are working actively with her ; Afghanistan is suspicious and nervous yet her claws have been cut by the snatching away of those states with whom she might have combined to resist.t Monthly Review of Revolt-tionary Movements No. 18, dated April 1920.5 hc/1279 dated 23.8.20.Islam is dividedj on the question, some for, some against, some using Bolshevism as a means to an end, but when we give it serious thought is it not significant that Islam is divided at all on the question ? Is it not likewise significant that the most learned Theologians in Constantinople have succumbed and are actively preaching its gospel, gThe danger lies equally in Afghanistan, Persia, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, that the reactionary forces the Bolshevik is organizing behind the government will, in time so divide opinion, so weaken control, as to make a coup d&apos;etat possible. Russia has taught the Eastern world new lessons in statecraft and intrigue.
Germany.Germany on the other hand is no less earnest in her endeavours to evade her disabilities and recover her prestige ; she too is willing to ally herself to any forces that will so assist her and is quite willing to work in with Bolshevist schemes so far as they are likely to ameliorate her own position. It is therefore in the interests of the German reactionaries to create and support unrest in the Middle East.* ^(3) dated 15.10.19.^90 dated 8.1.20.F.O. 5182 dated 22.5.20.Weekly Report No. 14 dated 22 5 20.F.O. 13543 dated 9.9.20.9*1^ dated 8.9.20.

Nationalists and Pan-Arabs were brought together and the whole matter was discussed, and a working arrangement was arrived at whilst Talaat working in contact with Berlin was entrusted with carrying out the latter part of the programme.Neither the Bolshevists nor the Germans were willing to commit themselves to Enver&apos;s scheme in the Caucasus until he was able to ii He/1293 dated 25.8.20. bring about an Asiatic Islamic Federation!! movement throughwhose medium all the various societies were to be amalgamated into a comprehensive whole. It is essential we should realize the import-ance of the creation of this Asiatic Islamic Federation. Before its relationship tc Bolshevism is explained, we must trace the steps that has made such a policy even outwardly possible. First and fore-most there must be material to work on ; briefly this material was ready to hand and the time, cleverly chosen, was opportune.1. The Nationalists were in dire straits ; their worst appprehen-sions as regards the terms offered to Turkey were realized. Isolated in Anatolia, cut off from the capital by its occupation by the Entente, their cause was threatened with extinction. They had the choice of two evils surrender to the terms of the treaty or co-operation with Enver and the Bolshevists. They were so to speak, starved into participation.2. The Syrian Nationalists at this period were likewise in extremis fervent in their desire for National independence ; England and France were, it was found, determined on fulfilling their mutnal agreements and the complete independence hoped for was impossible of aecomplishemnt.3. The pan-Arabs in Syria bitterly hostile to the French in Syria, uncertain as to the future in Mesopotamia, were easily persuaded that they had merely exchanged Turk for European as their masters.It did not require much persuasion therefore to encourage them in the conviction&apos; that their several aims might only be attained through mutual support under the guidance and help of Moscow and Berlin. All the different parties therefore were combined under the above, and outwardly at any rate Moscow had directed the various dissenting bodies into one channel.F.0.10154 dated 20.8.20.

Revolutionary organization of Berlin dated 22.4.20.t Monthly Review of Revolu-tionary Movements dated 19.5.20.At the identical time in which the above Asiatic Islamic Federa-tion was being formed we find the V.V.V. Society of John de Kaye re-organized (after he had visited Moscow on 23.12.19, where certain conditions were laid down), as &quot;The Society of oppressed Nations.&quot; &quot;To unite all the Revolutionary Parties of different countries to further the mutual cause.&quot; This Society is under the direct control of the German Foreign Office and linked up with the Asiatic Islamic Federation^Lenin and his Commissariat of military affairs are all for the International organization of military forces which in case of need would support any revolutionary movement inspired by the dictator-ship of the proletariat. Sporadic movements without international connection they regard as doomed to failure.^It is the latter conception that shows clearly how it was that Enver spent so much time and energy in bringing about the coalition of the various political bodies in Switzerland. This activity com-municated itself to all the various leaders, Talaat, Kemal, Shakib Arsalan, Fuad Selim, Nejmeddin Molla, all displayed increased activity which included frequent journeys to Italy and Berlin. It is noteworthy too that generally these activities were concentrated in promoting unity among the various groups. We have already seen the result of their efforts in the union of the different sections with the subsequent trouble.UNION OF C.U.P.

Early in March we learn that Mustafa KemaFs entourage desired to join the Bolshevists in the event of Turkey receiving harsh terms as they &quot; would prefer Bol-bolshevism to the loss of their independence.&quot; Correspondence was taking place between Nuri Pasha, Mustafa Kemal and the Bol-shevists on the one hand and Enver, Nitri, * Germans and Bolshevists on the other. By the 4th June we received a report that an agreement has been reached between the Bolshevists and the Turks. The following significant paragraph appears in TchitcheruPs replyf to advances for the above agreement, &quot; The Soviet Government take note of the will of the Great National Assembly of Turkey to conform in the course of working against the imperialist governments and of the military operations against them to the noble ideal of the liberation of $oppressed peoples.&quot; On the 19th May the Anatolian Press AgencyII (the official Press Bureau of the Nationalist Party) publishes the news of &quot; the conclusion of a treaty between Soviet Government and the Nationalist Government.&quot; On the 4th August, Mustafa Kemal telegraphs to Officer Commanding Army Corps in Anatolia &quot; In conformity with my previous communications the efforts I have been making for the last months with the object of assuring urgent material help for the Turkish armies in accordance with the terms of the agreement have been crowned with success. The Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Armies has let me know thestrength of the Contingent which is to be sent......Formilitary and political reasons it is not possible to withdraw troops from the Western and Southern fronts until a decisive result has been obtained in the European theatre of war, consequently it has been decided to send temporarily to Anatolia one Division of Cavalry and a Division of Infantry. The Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Armies has stated that he remains faithful to the agreement concluded between the Soviet Government and the oppressed Turkish Nation......It has been decided that these troops should arrive atBayazid and complete their concentration not later than 15th August.5 M.I.2.B. dated 20.9.20.Note.-G.O.C. Baghdad has informed us that Nakhichevan was occupied by Bolshevist troops on July 30th, while a supporting column was following close behind. Gerusi had already been occupied previous to this. Armenia had meantime facilitated this by coming to an arrangement with the Bolshevist and allowing the passage of troops.g
On the 5th August Mustafa Kemal issues a proclamation of which the following is an extract&apos; &quot; The sacred force of Bolshevismwhich holds out a helping hand to us.....as well as germany which has never been beaten will always assist us.&quot; Now that the two great nations with whom wo have alliedourselves are supporting and helping us.....I repeat thatyou must submit to the Holy Alliance and serve it.&quot; (Signed) Mustafa Kemal, &apos;   &quot; President of the Turkish Republic.&quot; 5th August, 1920.&quot;This proclamation in itself shows us clearly the position of. the Nationalist Government. We note how the masses are still to be hoodwinked by the pretence of religious duty and in order not to alienate the Pan-Islamists before they are irretrievably committed. Bolshevism is called &quot; Sacred &quot; and the alliance &quot; Holy.&quot; Yet the truth is revealed by the last word REPVBTAG which signifies the surrender to the Bolshevik policy and the abandonment of the Sultan as Khalif and in consequence the detachment of the Nationalist movement from the body of Islam.In the above we have the culmination of the various steps leading up to direct control by Moscow and we should compare these with the review overleaf under &quot;Soviet Bussia.&quot;  The steps were: 1. Discontent of the various communities of Anatolia, Syria and Mesopotamia.2. The focusing of this discontent into organized societies.3. The junction of these societies with each other.4. The linking up of these societies irrespective of policy on a Asiatic Islamic basis.5. The conversion through the above into Bolshevism.Now it must not be supposed that all the sections of peoples and opinions brought under the direct guidance of Moscow are working in harmony each is using the other, the Bolshevists to carry out their policy and the other to ameliorate their own position (Talaat and Enver have plans of their own the discussion of which would only serve to confuse the issue). But it is the very complexity of interests that weakens the opposition. It would be a dangerous policy to rely on extraneous circumstances relieving us of our dangers, unless we organize our resistance and co-ordinate these different factors of hostility to Bolshevism; we must remember that our opponent is working on a highly organized and single minded system; we have . to oppose an organized resistance. If it is considered that the Bolshevist regime will be destroyed or that by obtaining peace it will confine itself to its own affairs it by no means follows that our difficulties will disappear. The extremist section of Eastern thought have been roused and organised. Hundreds of capable men have been schooled in the principles of Bolshevism, whilst the more moderate elements have been instructed in ideals, the fulfilment of which, must tend to weaken Western Control. The ball has been set rolling. It is inconceivable that such an extensive organization with its myriads of propagandists should suddenly or even in a long period become innocuous. We have therefore two separate forces to contend against (1) The possibility of the success of the Bolshevik world revolution, (2) The possibility of Eastern National Move-ments, strengthened by Bolshevik organization combining in an anti-European cause.

APPRECIATION OF THE SITUATION. Afghanistan.The Bolshevist policy as regards Afghanistan was directed by three main considerations (a) Defensive: The prevention of an Islamic combination ofother Central Asian States with Afghanistan that might prove a serious menace on the one hand and shut off the &quot; corridor &quot; to India on the other.(b) Offensive :  1. The creation in Afghanistan itself of a revolu-tionary party that may eventually overthrow the present Government.2. At all costs to keep open the &quot; corridor &quot; to India in order to keep the tribes of the North West Frontier in a state of ferment and to enable Bolshevism to keep in touch with her propa-gandists in India.As a direct means of preventing (a) above the overthrow of Bokhara was decided on and carried out. To neutralize the evil effects of this drastic step Djemal Pasha has been sent to Kabul to strengthen the revolutionary party and the Bolshevists place great reliance on his mission. It remains to be seen therefore whether the presence of Djemal combined with the moral effect of the over-throw of the Bokhaean Government will neutralize the hostility provoked by this bold measure or whether this hostility if supported by Britain will so strengthen the Afghan Government as to embolden them to break definitely with the Bolshevists. In any case the position is critical and the activities of the reactionaries needs careful watching.Persia.No satisfactory solution has been arrived at between the Persian and Bolshevist governments. The former is frankly afraid of the latter and generally the Russian is heartily disliked. The Bolshevist has, however, a grip on the country which he seems in no hurry to relax, and the promotion of the reactionary party goes forward. Kutchak Khans discomfiture has not affected the situation to any appreciable extent and the Bolshevists immediately re-entrusted their propaganda to &quot; a committee of two.&quot; The situation in Persia is similar to that in Afghanistan. The Bolshevist has approached from several direc-tions to the Persian Borders and the future is very uncertain. The following telegraphic despatch from Mr. Norman shows very clearly how Bolshevik intrigue may result in the overthrow of the existing regime. This applies though perhaps in modified form to Afghanistan and Anatolia.13557 No. 36 dated 25.9.20.From Norman, Tehran, to Earl Curzon, No. 654, dated 25.9.20.&quot; On my arrival here I found in power a Government almost universally detested and entirely subservient to a Prime Minister to whom ill-health had left only energy required to increase his private fortune at public expense. His policy had caused Azerbaijan practically to separate itself from Persia and had driven Mazanderan into rebellion. Tabriz was in possession of K.K. and his followers who were allied with Bolsheviks. Capital was seething with Bolshevih intrigue and invitations to occupy it were being sent to Besht from many influential quarters. Had Bolsheviks responded in time their advance might well have been assisted by a rising here and they would failing the occupation of Tehran by the British troops have received welcome from a large section of the population chiefly of lower class.&quot;
Anatolia.The Nationalist Government demoralized and disheartened showed recent signs: of capitulation, and the military forces every sign of demoralization. The secret socieites have, however, for the moment complete control, Mustafa Kemal has been committed by his delegates in Moscow into accepting the Bolshevist terms,* indeed his position is analogous to that of the Amir Feisal last March. * He/1270 dated 25,8 20 There are persistent rumours that he is to be superseded by a Sovietwekkly ltwoiiT no. 20 dated 3.7.20 (jovernmeI1t.*  in general the Turks of Anatolia are hostile toBolshevism and hate Enver Bolshevik propaganda however is becoming rampant in the country; several towns now have highly organized revolutionary organizations; 105 members of the Great National Assembly are committed to a Bolshevik programme. Direct contact has been obtained by the Bolshevists through Nakhivan. It would appear that the Bolshevists forces (said to be 2 Divisions) have been sent mainly to re-invigorate the waning enthusiasm of the Turkish Nationalists and possibly according to predecent to establish a Soviet regime.On. the other hand opinion in Anatolia is greatly divided on the question of Bolshevism; the Army Commanders are not entirely to be relied on ; and pan-Islamism has little favour. While therefore there is plenty of material on which we might work to reverse the present position, it would appear that urgent measures are necessary to . gain touch with these elements and by counter-propaganda directed from Constantinople, Mosul and Syria encourage them to break away from reactionary forces ; that the Turkish Government might be strengthened and supported in order to deal effectively with the situation in order to break up the Nationalist organization  otherwise it is possible that at the least the Nationalist resistance encouraged by the extraneous assistance and moral support may be prolonged or at the worst that their forces may regain such organiza-tion as to become a potential force that may re-act unfavourably in Mesopotamia or Persia.Armenia.t M.I.2.B.dated22.9.20. Has made a &quot;temporary&quot; agreement with the Bolshevistsfand permitted the passage of &quot; Bed &quot; troops through her territories, thus permitting direct contact between the Bolshevist and Nationalist forces.Further the negotiations are to be transferred to Erivan where they will be assisted on the Bolshevist side by &quot; consular guards.&quot;The Armenian Government will thus be dominated by the Bolshevists. By acquiring the railway line from Shahtakhti to Djulea they may operate at will towards Erivan, Bayazid, or Tabriz.We may therefore expect the Bolshevists soon to obtain complete control of the country.The above situations have been produced by the Bolshevist policy of an attack on India worked out on a definite plan after various important agreements had been reached at Moscow attended by the various parties concerned.Talaat is charged with the direction of the movement in Syria, Egypt, Arabia.dated 3.4.20. dated 24.8.20.Djevad is charged with the direction of the movement in Greece, Italy and France.
Khelil is charged with the direction of the movement in Persia.In addition attempts are being made to cause serious embarrass-ment to the Government in England, Ireland and India, these latter forming &quot; interior &quot; lines of attack, the former comprising direct lines of attack.Mesopotamia.Investigations undertaken to trace4 the unrest in Mesopotamia have necessitated an enquiry embracing far distant spheres. Similarly in suggesting measures for our protection it will be necessary to propose counter measures that embrace other spheres besides that with which we are immediately interested. As regards Mesopotamia itself the vital point is to separate pan-Arab from the Turkish Nationalist elements. As a direct means of doing this it would be well worth considering the practicability of detaching the pan-Arab elements from the Turkish Nationalists through the medium of the El&apos;ahd Society of which Jaafar al Askeri is a member. This society was formed in 1909 for action against the Turks: even now it is at heart anti-Turk. Tiiabit abd an Nur, whose son was a from-nent member of the society is now in Paris and still maintains that the Ahd would prove a valuable help to us in pacifying Arabia.The pan-Arab party in Mesopotamia is as sincere and ardent in its desire for independence as the Egyptian Nationalists. The majority of this party favour development under British control, they have been persuaded that the independence they hoped for was being denied them. If we can enlighten them as to our honesty of purpose there would appear to be good grounds for hoping we might detach them from the Nationalist-Bolshevist control.Enver is charged with the direction of the movement in Caucasus. c.G.s. x.i627 dated 1.0.20. Jemal is charged with the direction of the movement inO.G.S. X.1032 dated 3.9.20. afghanistan.
