The depression in the boot and shoe trade has extended to other branches of the leather trade.Among the factors combining to produce unemployment were: (a.) High prices, which discourage possible purchasers, (b.) Refusal of banks to lend money, which is checking both the making and holding of stocks.(c.) Threat of coal strike and general uncertainty of labour situation, (d.) Fluctuations of the foreign exchanges, which seriously affects foreign orders.
