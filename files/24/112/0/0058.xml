(This Document is the Property of 3 Hntamiic Majesty^ Government)HiFrom Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, Sth October 1920.4058(Received 9th.)priority A.177 S. Tribune newspaper, 7th October, publishes recent correspondence between Afghan envoy here and Shaukat Ali, regarding plan oi Central Khilafat Committee to revive and finance Hijrat movement to Afghanistan. Envoy&apos;s letter states that he has sent Shaukat Ali&apos;s letter to Amir, that latter has given permission for resumption of Hijrat, and that envoy is ready to receive visit from notorious agitator Maulana Abdul Kalan Azad and Mr.&apos; Yakub, Secretary of the Central Khilafat Committee. I understand the gist of this correspondence is being telegraphed to The Times with comment on the gross impropriety of the envoy&apos;s conduct. Foreign Secretary had already at interview brought to notice of envoy letter from him to Shaukat Ali published in Zamindar newspaper, 4th September. Envoy apologised humbly,, said his writing was due to ignorance of diplomatic usage and promised not to repeat the offence. Correspondence now published in Tribune&apos; took, place weeks before this interview, but was not known to us at the time. If decision of Afghan Government regarding the agreement with us were not at this moment in balance, I should have suggested an (sic) envoy to leave forthwith, but in the circumstances I am (? contenting) myself with strong official remonstrance and request for immediate written pledge that he will for so long as he is accredited, (? to the Government of India) engage in no correspondence.on matters of official or public importance with any person in India other than with Afghan subjects except through the Foreign Department of the Government of India, and that he will abstain from all connection with political or religious agitation in India.
