PIflSCTOPATE OF INMLLIGmOSScotland House, 8,V/.l. -  15 th October,1920.In the absence of Mr. J, H. Thomas, Mr. 0. T. Cramp is making preparations for calling out the railwayman.    A meeting of the Executive will be held on Saturday.    The membership of the National Union of Railwayman is 481,081, and the total credit balance of the Union at the end of 1919 was  1,188,853.    The strike, if it takes place, will probably be partial for, oxoopting South Wales, the railwaymen havo little sympathy with the miners,Bromley will try to bring out the drivers in his Union, but in some places thes are jealous of the miners, who earn higher wages.The dockers are said to be opposed to a strike, but other sections of the Transport Workers may be prevailed upon to come out on account of their own grievances. Mrf Ben Smith, of the United Vehicle Workers, stated reoently that, while thoy were giving the miners moral support, they realised the madnoss of stopping transport altogether.    They would, however, lay down terms on which they would work.Ono of my correspondents reports the result of a conversation with a leader of the Irish Self-Determination League in London.    He said that the Sinn Fein leaders in England are much distressed about the Prime Minister&apos;0 speech at Carnarvon.    They gather that the movement is to he crushed by brute force and they are helpless.    They realise the strength of the anti-Irish feeling throughout the country and if a General Election were to take plaoe either on Uhe Irish cruestion or the coal strike they would be beaten. Labour, he said, knew this too.IRELANDThey/
Thoy have no faith in Mr. Asquith or lord Grey and certainly none in English labour,   The Sinn Peiners are losing heart in Iroland and it is only a handful of desperate men who will fight to the end.    They bitterly repudiate the statement that the Sinn Seiners have had German money,As this man is in a peculiar position for knowing the facts about the MacSwiney case, the following is interesting: -He said that MacSwiney is being fed but that he does not get enough to keep him alive for long and they hope the Government will release him just before his death.   They realise that everyone in England has lost interest in MaoSvdney and looteupon him as a fraud, and the only reason for maintaining tha hunger strike is that it is benefiting the Sinn Pein cause abroad.
