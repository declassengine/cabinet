1,934^jj-io Document is Via Property of His Britannic       .W,7&apos;S Government,rr Ciypug^g by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of Stale for India,2nd October 1920.Following is weekly telegram : Discussion in Press still centres round Congress resolution adopting non-co-operation and effect on Congress itself, change in constitution of which now freely urged, even by Lajpat Rai. Resignations from candidature reported from various provinces, number about 80, but Malaviya lias characterised boycott of councils dangerous doctrine, is standing himself and advises others also to stand as power within councils, if returned, greater than outside them for attaining ideal fulfilment of (? modified) Government, and exposing misdeeds of executive Government. Shastri has been delivering useful lectures on same subject. Bengali states &quot; in Bengal at any rate no question that public sentiment entirely against non-co-operation.&quot; New India (Madras) considers Congress struck a deadly blow at national progress; while Madras reports unlikely resolution will find wide acceptance in presidency. Boycott of foreign goods attacked as foolish, and impracticable. Leader (Allahabad) points out that boycott will not paralyse Government, and Sir Chandavakar describes failure in Poona, in seventies, of private arbitration courts set up as protest, owing to innate spirit of litigiousness; Gandhi said to be issuing manifesto urging voters to refrain from voting for any candidates for reformed councils. In view of possible attempts being made to prevent candi-dates from, standing, or voters from voting by threat of social boycott or other means, we are pointing out to Local Governments, with a view to uniformity of action, Corrupt Practices Act makes exercise of undue influence affecting electoral right offence punishable with imprisonment and urging prosecution in such cases. .Report of Congress Sub-Committee (Gandhi, Patel, Motilal Nehru) published with invitation to public to submit criticisms before 2nd October. Committee state that Congress has approved of whole of Gandhi&apos;s programme of progressive non-violent non-co-operation, but has adopted for immediate use items in first stage only. Congress will determine pace for remaining three stages, namely, resignation of civil and military employment and suspension of payment of. taxes. As regards items in first stage committee suggest :-(a) Deputations should approach all title holders, and explain illusory misconception about hollow Government gifts, but undue pressure and violence of language to be scrupulously avoided, (b) Boycott of Government schools and colleges easiest step owing to growing political consciousness of parents and older students. Government employment, to which present education leads, must be spurned. Closure of Government schools will create demand for national schools. Meanwhile, children should receive private education or be apprenticed to patriotic merchants or artisans. Aided schools should dispense with Government grauts. (c) Government wield tremendous power through law courts. Lawyers must therefore boycott courts, and instead of devoting leisure to public movements, become whole-time publicists devoting services to national schools, private arbitration, or propaganda work. Deputation to approach lawyers for above ends. Pandit Motilal Nehru further suggests immediate establishment of arbitration courts, and application of boycott against those who defy orders of such courts, (d) Boycott of councils of greatest importance, deputation should approach candidates. Electors&apos; signatures should be secured to manifesto declaring unwillingness to be represented in council till Punjab and Khilafat wrongs redressed, (e) Vigorous propaganda urged against possible recruits for Mesopotamia (in this connection it may be noted that campaign to &quot; call back our armies &quot; is being energetically pushed by Bombay Chronicle and Lndependent). (/) Boycott of foreign goods considered unfortunate interpolation due to misapprehension, but co-operators must simplify those wants, satisfaction of which depends on foreign supplies. Great importance attached to revival of hand spinning and hand weaving; spinning classes to be formed, and Swadeshi workers to communicate with, manager, Satyagraha Ashram, at Ahmedabad. Lajpat Rai has written to Press objecting strongly to description of this item as mischievous interpo-lation. (g) Urge collection of large national fund and formation of volunteer corps to engender discipline and maintain order.&quot; (li) Where sufficient workers available, to be divided into batches, each responsible for special item of work; where few workers2420     100  10/20

All-India Congress Committee meets on 2nd October in Bombay to consider these proposals, general reception of which in country remains to be seen, but there are clear and continued indications that extremists derive much encouragement from events in Ireland and Egypt, which they state prove the value of non-co-operation methods.3. Case against Zafar Ali Khan under section 124a and 153a of Indian Penal Code continues in Lahore. Accused pleads not guilty, but will not defend himself beyond making statement; will not cross-examine witnesses ; no great sympathy said to be felt for him in Punjab.4. Returned Muhnjarin reported to be rapidly settling down. Jnnejo has returned from Kabul and will go home. On arrival, at Peshawar stated he is rained and disillusioned.

Dissatisfaction expressed in extremist Press at acquittal of Chilcot in Kachagarhi trial and.demands for impartial enquiry. ^Statement describing action taken by Government of India against officers censured in connection with Punjab disturbances severely criticised by opposition Press as being inadequate.
