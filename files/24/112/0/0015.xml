Mr. Montagu thinks it essential that in every case the Government should maintain the pledges given to individual ex-soldiers on its behalf by individual Councils and also that steps should be tsu:en to secure that in giving effect to the recommendations contained in uhe Report the position of Councils which have already entered into negotiations for the acquisition of land, should be safeguarded.Sir Robert Home and Lr. ivlunro have up to the present been unable to give any time to the Committee and consequently are not prepared to express any opinion on the recommendations contained in the Interim Report.(Initialled)    L.W.E.

Royoe, M,Pa, Major W. Murray, M.P., with Mr. R.B. Howorth as Secretary, was appointed in pursuance of the decision of the Cabinet held on 15th July, 1980 (Cabinet 40 (SO) Conclusion 2) to overhaul the present policy and machinery of Land Settlement. The Cabinet further directed that the Committee should consider how far it was reasonably possible to meet the demands of the numerous applicants for Small Holdings, and what additional financial assistance, if any, should bo rendered by the Government, and what economies could be enforced in the method of purchase or renting of land, in the size of holdings, and the provision of equipment.     The Committee was referred to the recommendations contained in the Reports of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee (G. 225 and G.T. 6373). 2.    At the outset the Committee decided to consider first the problem of the Land Settlement of the Ex-Service man in England and Wales and then to proceed with the consideration of the Scottish aspect of the problem.This
All tService men,    1 statement of policy issued by thePrime Minister on the 6th December, 1918, contained the following sentences:-&quot;There is generally a great anxiety expressed by multitudes of our soldiers for settling on the land.It is a happy aspiration and one that conforms in the highest&quot;degree with the interests of the State..&quot;The Government have already great schemes necessarily involving a large expenditure of public money f02 the purchase of land for soldiers who desire to earn a living in cultivation.   There will be provision for Ex-Service men Sor either small holdings, cottage sites, and garden holding, or allotments on lease according to L the choice which they like and fitness which they show.Provision has been made for building houses, money hasbeen^1; This report is oonoerned solely with the question ir: jinglandand Wales.   The Committee have been supplied with copiesof the previous Cabinet Papers on the subject, and v/ithMemoranda and other documents prepared by the Departmentsconcerned.    It has also taken evidence from the chairmen of the Small Holdings Committees of Staffordshireand Lindsay County Councils, and from District Commission-ers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.3*    It may be recalled that as a result of representations made in the Autumn of 1917 and the Spring of 1918 byLord Ernie and Dr.Addison the War Cabinet referred thequestion of the Land Settlement of the  x-Service man toa Committee of Ministers preside! over by Lord Cave.This Committee issued two &quot;Reports in October and november 1918, (6.225 and G.T.6373), the Committee&apos;srecommendations were accepted by the Cabinet, and in themain were subsequently incorporated in the Lane!Settlement (Facilities) Act, which received the Royal Assenton the 19th August, 1919.BE PLEDGE    4.     The Government has throughout been deeply pledged 0 THE EX-RVICS MAN. in the matter of the Land Settlement of suitable Ex-
SSRAL JANCIAL 0GEMENTS,I been sot aside for the provision of equipment and cultivation of the land, and credit will be provided on easy terms for&apos; the stocking of the land.   Facilities will be provided to enable tenants to purchase their holdings,&quot;Pronouncements in very similar terms were made in a coalition Manifesto, dated 22nd November. 1918, and in thePrime Minister1 a wolvrrhantpton speech on the 2?th November,1918.THE FIT ^X-ST!!RYI^ HAN,The decision of the Government at the end of 1918was that a sum of  20,000,000 should be provided forthe Land Settlement of Ex-Service men in Grnat Britain.Owing, however, to a misunderstanding which occurred during the passing of the Land Settlement (Facilities)Act, 19191 Section 14 of that Aot in fact provides amaximum of  20 ,.000, GOO for leans t&amp; Councils in Englandand &quot;Vales only, and for Parliamentary reasons it was thought necessary in consequence to insert im &quot;equivalent&quot;amount, namely  2,750,000 in Seat ion 26 of th^ Land Settle-ment (Scotland) Act, 1919, passed later in the session,!MINISTERIAL 6. But it was definitely agreed between the Chancellor MOT,of the Exchequer and the Ministers concerned that arrange-ments would be made to limit the total expenditure to the  20,000,000 originally intended.    The deduction from this amount of the proportionate Scottish share, approximately  2,420,000 and the expenditure estimated to be incurred by the Klnistry of Agriculture direct from their Vote upon certain Farm Settlements, reduces the.amoutf  available for Councils in England and *%.les to  16,000,000. 7. The above total of  20,000,000 is available forthe purpose of loans made by the Public Works Loan f Commissioners to Councils before the expiration of twoyears from the date I19th August, 1919) of the passing
of the Act.     It may ho remarked that it is not necessary that the money should all be expended by the Councils before the 19th August, 1921.     That date is the limit for tho issues from the Consolidated Fund ,to the Public Torks Loan Commissioners for the purpose of loans made by them before that date.     A loan is made when it is granted irrespective of when the actual cash instalments are drawn.     The date of 19th August, 1921, will heed to be extended by Statute for at least two years, because many Councils will be; unabln to apply for their quota of the total available money until long after August next.ISTICAL      8, Of the sum of  16,000,000 available for Councils:iiq]\t,in England and &apos;7ales the amount actually issued by the. Public Works Loan Board up to 21st September, 1920, is only  6,668,84-6, but the cost of the land acquired by Councils up to 21st August 1920, plus the estimated cost of equipping it, is expected to amount to  13,620,000.9 . The f inan0ial position is unsatisfact0ry.The capital cost of estates already acquired when developed for land settlement purposes will average approximately  65&quot; per a ore, made up of  40 cost of land with existing equipment and  25 estimated cost of new equipment: yet to be provided. 10.       Assuming - as is hoped, that economies 4 an be effected by the reduction of the average holding from 1?      13i acres,x   by the reduction of cost of equipment from  2^ to  20 per acre, and by the substitution of leasing or purchase by Annuities for cash purchases for a very&apos; considerable proportion of the land acquired,* 4 **xNote,   Holdings vary in size from one to fifty acres and it must not be assumed that a large proportion will be holdings of 131 acres.
it is anticipated that  1,000,000 will in future settle 1400 applicants or an average capital outlay of  710 per man.     The commitments of  13,620,000 up to the 21st August 1920 will provide for approximately 14;300 applicants on the basis of an estimated Capital outlay of  950 per man, and, assuming  16,000,000 only available, the balance of  2,380,000 will supply 33?0 further applicants at an average capital outlay of &apos;  710 rjer man.11.       After mo-kin? certain adjustments it is antioipa-ted that the  1^,000,000 will suffice to settles17,199 applicants.     It is estimated, however, thatthe total number of approved applicants, including those already provided for (but excluding those onthe now waiting list opened since July 31st, 1920 -will be 28,474, of whom 17.199 *ill be provided forout of the  16,000,000 leaving 11,275 approvedapplicants (in addition to those on the now waitinglist) who must remain unsatisfied.12.       On the basis of  710 capital outlay per manan additional  8,000,000 would bo required to settlethese 11,275 applicants, and oven then no provision would have been made for the settlement of the menon the now waiting list, the disabled ex-service monand ordinary civilian applicants.SUMMARY OP     13.        Briefly the position appears to be that 11,275 THE future position,        applicants remain unsatisfied for whom (en the basisof 13i acres per man) lj2,000 aares have still to be aequired.     If this acreage were purchased for
oaoh the cost would &quot;beLand 1^2,000 acres Q 40 .........  6,080,000Equipment at por acre  20 ......,..  3,040,000 9,120,00014.        No account has been taken of disabled men inthese figures, except in no far as a few Counties,e.g. Staffordshire have been approving suchapplicants.     If the disabled demand bo based on therough estimate given in the Minister of Agriculture13Cabinet Memorandum of February 13th, 1920 (No,CP. 628)an extra amount must be allowed as follows:-Land for 1,000 holdings of from 1 to 3 acres at per holding  200 .......  200,0001,000 cottages at  900 ...............    ^00,000^ 1,100,000l$i        The grand totals for able-bodied and disabledwould therefore be !-Land............................. 6,280,000Equipment...........................    3,940,000 10,220,00016.        The Committee are satisfied that the scheme of land settlement by small-holdings now in operation in England and Wales and under which the arrangements are administered by the Councils under the general.super-vision and guidance of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is efficiently and ^ sonomioally conducted and that thn present difficulties cannot be attributed either to the schema itself or to the &quot;machinery by which the scheme is worked.     The Committee are satisfied that but for the rigid cutting of the Councils building schemes effected by the Ministry&apos;s superintending architects the capital expenditure per folding would be substantially higher than it is.     The Committee hope that the ? inistry will endeavour to tighten its control over the Councils1 building expenditure still further if possible.
17.        In the view of the Committee the cliff icult ieo of the present position of Land Settlement are in the main f du&apos;- to th&apos;&apos;1 fa at that the available financial resourceshave provud inadequate on account of th-&apos; unexpectedly large numb N.r of nperovM applicants and the high capital coot of equipped holdings formed on land purchased for cash.00HOMIES l8.        In tho internets of national economy, it is1THIN THE0SEKT SCHEHE. imperative at the present time to restrict to tho utmost possible extent calls on tho Exchequer especially those involving additional capital expenditure, and the Committee have devoted much attention to the question of effecting economies within the existing scheme.     After careful consideration the Committee foel that economies may be possible in three directions(l)   A reduction of applicants.(2.)   The acquisition of land otherwise than for cash.(3)   By keeping rigid control over the oapital expenditure per holding on the lines of the Ministry of Agriculture1s Circular of July 31st. Even though that will prevent the creation and equipment of the larger types of dairy and other holdings.&apos;R0VAL OF 19.        Tho Committee have no reason to doubt that takingII CASTS.England and Tales generally, the Councils have exercised all reasonable care in approving applicants.     At the same time the Committee observe that the number of approved applicants boars a very high proportion to the total number of applicants, and they understand that in certain localities the practice obtains of placing doubtful applicants on the approved list,, though possibly in a low category of that list.     Again it sometimes happens that when land comes to be actually divided for small holdings, the Councils select the best qualified candidates from the approved list, thus
if 5&quot;,upostponing almost indefinitely men who have boon approved, but who arc not of the boat type of applicants    &apos; hile fully realising the necessity from the point of view of only placing on the land the best qualified applicants, for      ^ the exercise of the moat careful selection, the Committee . recommend;-(1)   (a)   That selection should be clone once and forall at tho outset, the men be in,&quot; then cither placed on tho approved list, or rejected altogether, men on the approved list in the different localities being offered holdings, save in exceptional circumstances, in order of date of application^-(b) That a definite timo limit should bo imposed within which ox-Sorvicc men must apply in order to be treated as eligible for tho preference provided under the Act.    Any ex-Scrvico applicants A linf- to apply within such tfino limit to-be eligible for the sa::io treatment as ordinary civilian applicants.(c) That the time limit should be 33cc ember 1st, 1920. and that the Ministry of Agriculture should publish this time limit as Vtidcly as possible.(d) That the preference to cx-Scrvice men be extended by statute beyond August 19th,1921, when it will expire, for a further two years * Failing this Councils rAH be entitled to let to &quot;the best applicants whether ex-Service or Civilian.(2) Tho Committee consider that the Governmentpledge is satisfied by the offer to an applicant of suitable land, at a reasonable rent, and they recommend that an applicant who refuses such an offer should be struck off the approved list,IPROVISIOH OF 20.       IThllc...there is little difficulty in acquiring &quot;AND.suitable land for cash, the amount of land which Councils have hitherto beer, able to acquire by lease or for County Annuities only aggregates about 13,000 acres.    The objections which may bo urged by &amp; private owner to leasing I1 his land or selling it for an Avmutty should not apply tothe case of land owned by the&apos; Crown, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, CoHo^cs, City Companies, Glebe owners, Hospitals, Charities, and other Corporate Bodies,-tQm
The Committee recommend:-        - 85That the most strenuous efforts should be made to persuade Corporate bodies to lease or soil for Annuities any suitable land owned by them which tho Council concerned nay wish to acquire for Small Holdings21.    Tho Office of woods and Forests hold 79,000acros of agricultural land. In 3n land 14,481 acres of which is let for Small Holdings and Allotments,Under an arrangement with the Ministry of Agricultureany farm becoming vacant is offered, in the firstplace$ to the County concerned for small holding*purposes*    The Committee are informed that theCommissioners of the woods and Forests would bowilling to dispose of land, which they wished tosell for county annuities, and the committee recommend:- &apos;That a schedule of the agricultural lands hold by tho Office of floods and -Forests be subjected to a careful examination by the Ministry of Agriculture, with a view to the selection of any land suitable for small holdings as soon as tho examination is completed particulars of the selected land should be furnished to the Council concerned with a view to purchase for annuity or leasing.22m    Similarly the Committee recommend:-That a schedule of the surplus agri-cultural lands held by tho Service Departments be submitted to and examined by :ho Ministry of&apos; Agriculture so that particulars of any land suitable for small holdings may bo submittod to the Council concerned for acquisition by leasing or purchaso for Annuity.23i    The average size of tho holdings actuallylet between the let January 1910 and the .31stAugust 1920 was 15 acres, which it is hoped toxrcduco in future to 13f acres.    The size of the holdings must no doubt vary with the character and situation of the lan&amp;j and tho Committoo are not prepared to say that the average of 134 acres is excessivov    The attention of the Committee has-9*        x see note on page 4.

In view of the imperative need of avoiding fresh OTHERWISEFOR CASH,   calls on the Bxchcquor for capital monies, the 0 omit too have devoted considerable attention to the question of the acquisition of land otherwise than for cash,    Tho principal methods by which this can bo accomplished are by leasing, by purchase for County Annuities and by entering into mortgage arrangements with Vendors * rt n Compulsory Powers,    either the ministryof Agriculture nor the County Councils have compulsory powers to acquire land for Annuities,    Compulsory Powers can only extend to purchases  or cash and to leaning, Purchase for Annuities is therefore subject in each case to the goodwill of the vendor,    Tho Committee do not consider that -cue present situation.
warrants any extension of the compulsory powers already vested in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Councils. 28.   Leasing.   Prior to-the war 30$ of the land was acquired by leasingi   Since 1919 the proportion has dropped to 10f;. The Councils are most reluctant to have recourse to their compulsory powers and while the Committee are satisfied that only a comparatively small amount of land will be acquired by leasing In future, they trust that Councils will be urgently reminded that it is their duty in the national interest to exercise their leasing powers.- ,29.   County&apos; Annul13es.   The Committee understand that the Treasury are pre-fared to sanction the increase of the rate of interest payable by Councils in respect to perpetual County Annuities from 5^;i to.. 6$, and also to allow Councils to issue terminable annuities at a corresponding rate of interest. These concessions should remove one of the principal diffi-culties which have hitherto prevented Councils from acquiring land for Annuities.under proper restrictions 30.   The Committee recommend that Councils be encouraged/to finance Land Settlement locally, and that any sums so raisedshould not be regarded as coming within the Quota of the LandSettlement Fund allocated to the County.51.   Reclamation.   The Committee are satisfied that experience has shown that Reclamation schemes are most uneconomical and moreover that the ex-service man will not take up reclaimed land mcich of which would never be suitable for small holdings, and in any case not for several years.32.   PurchasesV tenants^   The Committee are also satisfied that every effort has oeen made by the Ministry of Agriculture to encourage the purchase of small holdings- by tenants and applicants.   As a rule the Councils are not friendly to the policy, and difficulties frequently arise owing to the fact that the sale of the particular holding depreciates the value
I af the-adjoining land.   It seemsJUnprobable that any appre-1 eiablB-savings in the prevision of capital money or in annuallosses may be looked for from this source.rtfRTHER      33.   Any estimate of the capital sum which might be saved iSSISTAJKXE?R0M THE   &quot;*tj^--EXrCneqxier&quot;&apos;&apos;by-the adoption of the foregoing reoommenda-?exchequer$fyUIRBD.   tions, must be regarded with great caution.   It is clear,however, that economics within the existing scheme will not suffice by themselves to solve the financial difficulties, and very reluctantly the Committee are forced to the con-elusion that it will be necessary if the existing pledges are to be carried out, that some additional assistance should be forthcoming from the Exchequer. 34.   The Committee accordingly recommend -that the agreement referred to in paragraph 6 above should be re-opened and that a further sum of  4,000,000 (or a maximum of  20,000,000 in all) should be issued by the Treasury to the Public Works Loan Commissioners for the purpose of making loans to County Councils under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919.   In making this recommendation , however, the Committee are of opinion that any funds required for the purpose of the settlement of the disabled ex-Service, man should be provided out of the  20,000,000.35.   The Committee think that the further  4,000,000 men-tloned above should be definitely earmarked for the pro-vision of equipment and that the Ministry of Agriculture should make the Increase of the quota of a Council con-ditional on (1) the Council undertaking to provide for the disabled men from its area on the lines indicated in the following paragraphs and (2) the Council providing the land still required either by leasing or by County Annuities   c3  by raising the money locally the intention being that In tie case of Corporate Bodies the preliminary ^ negotiations for the acquisition of the land should be     b
conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture.   It will be necessary for the Ministry to impress upon Councils that the additional land must be Obtained otherwise than for cash even though this may involve recourse to the Council statutory powers of leasing and that appeals must be mada to land owners to induce them to sell their land for County Annuities. THE DISABLED EX-SERVICE MAM * SETTLE-&apos;   2?fi.   Hitherto this Report has dealt with the problem -ABLED M.p.      as presented by the fit ex-service man.   The furtherproblem of the disabled man was submitted to the Cabinet in a Memorandum by the Minister-of Agriculture (CP.628) on the 13th February, 1920, and was considered by the Home Affairs Committee at their Meeting on the 1st March, 1920.37.   The position of these men is peculiarly difficult. They are being trained by the Ministry of Agriculture in Agricultural and Horticultural pursuits, and for the reasons fully stated in the Memorandum, the majority of them find it impossible to obtai n employment on the expiration of their training.58.   It is estimated that about 4,000 men in all may have to be trained,-and on the assumption that only 1,000 of these men will apply for holdings and be found suitable for land1 settlement,    it is estimated that a capital expenditure of  1,100,000 will be required, while the net annual charge involved will not be less than  50,000.   The Committee concur in the decision, which they understand has been taken by the Ministry of Agri-culture , to refrain from accepting applications for training any further disabled men.
39.    The Committee consider that the interests -of the trained disabled men will%h*rbest served by entrusting their s ettlement on the land tothe Councils from whose areas they come.   Underthis plan tho Councils could no doubt make useof the local Pensions Committees or other appropriate1o c al mac hinery.40* The Co: Tilt tee accordingly make- the following recommendations(1)   That on tho expiration of his period of training, the disabled ex-service man should be specially examined by, the Small Holdings Committees and representa-tives of the Training Authority in each eounty and that only those candidates who, the Council are satisfied, will cultivate their land properly and will succeed in obtaining a decent livelihood by means of their pensions and any earn-ings derived from, their holdings should he treated as eligible for the benefits of this scheme.(2)   That the names of the duly qualified candi* dates under (1) above should be submitted to tho Councils from whose --rea they comes and that my increase of a Council&apos;s quota attributable to the &quot;new money&quot; (the sum not exceeding  4,000,000 of para.34) should only be granted on the express condition that provision for the Council&apos;s disabled, qualified candidates is made therefrom.(3)   That the Ministry of Agriculture shouldrelax Scale &quot;A&quot; of the Circular of the 31st July, 1920, in favour of such disabled men, so as to enable the Councils to provide cottage holdings for them.-14
SUMMARY OF VRIHCIPAL RBCQHICTPATIONS,(a) The selection of applicants should be done once and for all at the cutset, the men being then either placed on the Approved List or rejected altogether.   !!en on the Approved List In the different localities should be offered holdings, s*ve in exceptional circum-stances,.in order of date of application.(b) A. definite time limit should be imposed within fhloh ex-service men must apply-in order to be treated as eligible for the preference provided under the Act,   Any ex-Service applicants failing to apply within such time limit to be eligible for the same treatment as ordinary civilian applicants.(c) The time limit should be December 1st. 1920, and the Ministry of Agriculture should publish this time limit as widely as possible,(d) The preference to ex-Service men be extended by statute beyond August 19th, 1921, when it will expire, for a further two years.,Applicants who refuse the offer of suitable land at a reasonable rent should be struck off the Approved Li fit.(paragraph 19)-15-
