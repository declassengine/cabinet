2i ^JCirculated by the Secretary of State for India. secret.This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Ooyernmenr.ESHER COMMITTEE REPORT.nk I should inform my colleagues as to the condition of affairs with regard tojlji^sher Committee Report.r-&quot;&quot;   I have gone no further in acceptance of the Esher Committee^ recommendations / than I was authorised to go by the Cabinet Conclusion on Part I. on the 12th May,/ which I quote : 2) &quot; That the Secretary of State for India should be authorised to inform the Chairman of the Committee that the Cabinet were favourably disposed towards the Report, subject to such changes as were required to briug it into line with existing constitutional relations, but that they could give no final decision on Part I. of the Report as a whole until the remaining portions of the Committee&apos;s Report were before them.&quot;I have also approved the Esher recommendation of four Army Commands in India, and unless any of my colleagues object, I would propose possibly to consider with a view to adoption some of the steps for the amelioration of the conditions of service in India. I am, therefore, not committed in any way further than the Cabinet authorised in the spring, and as at present advised, I share some of the objections which have been voiced in the Press.i The Report has received the consideration of the Government of India, whose views I have had. It is now being considered by the Council of India. I will lay these views before the Cabinet in due course, and then ask if I may have a Cabinet Committee to consider the action that the Government should take.E. S.
