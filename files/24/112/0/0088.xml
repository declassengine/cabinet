This Document is the Pnporty of&apos; rf) .  -  .     ^g,^I t (. \] KCirc^iftteq by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.I have circulated to my colleagues fortnightly, and recently weekly, telegrams received from the Viceroy on the general situation in India. It occurs to me that some of them would be interested in a general appreciation of the situation.I will first set down a list of the factors which, in my opinion, make the situation difficult.1. General world unrest. The dissatisfaction with existing institutions which appears in every country as the consequence, if not as the outcome, of the recent war, has of course shown itself in India. Indeed, no country has escaped from a sort of ruthless political stock-taking, and politicians in India are peculiarly imitative. They watch events in other countries with the closest attention, and on the whole it would seem to me to be surprising that we have escaped so lightly from this in India.2. Economic discontent caused by high prices I suppose that wages have nowhere kept pace with price inflation. In India high, prices are peculiarly dangerous, where so large a proportion of the population has so little money to handle. The currency policy of the Government has steadied prices. There is now, I think, a downward trend. But the situation is rendered more grave this year by the failure, to a certain extent, of the September rains, which, if it does not mean famine, means at any rate scarcity.3. Indian soldiers who were persuaded, and, to face the matter quite frankly, persuaded with great vigour, in certain places, particularly in the Punjab, to join His Majesty&apos;s forces during the war, have been kept overseas away from their home for a very long time without leave. The Indian soldier is nearly always a cultivator. His family is peculiarly at the mercy of the money-lender, his affairs are liable to become very much involved, his holding is very difficult to keep in cultivation when he is from home for a long time. The-scarcity of imperial man-power and the length of the war made this inevitable. The great amount of time taken to reach a post-war settlement which, in those parts dependent upon India for its soldiers, is not yet in sight, has increased the gravity of the situation. The peace which the soldiers are kept abroad to enforce, some of them not relieved since the early stages of the war, does not commend itself to Indian opinion. The War Office are doing their best to relieve Indian units, but this difficulty comes at a time when at last Indians are getting to recognise their army is existing for the defence of India and not a mercenary army for the maintenance of British power, as it has sometimes been considered in the past. This factor will present increasing difficulties and will be increasingly exploited for political purposes until it is corrected by the return of the Indian armies to India. The situation is rendered more difficult because the demand for the return of the soldiers, genuinely voiced by their families and exploited by the agitator, is reinforced by British newspapers, such as the Times, the Daily Mail, and the Daily Express.4. The Indian reforms scheme, now ratified and endorsed by Parliament, was strictly limited by the formula drafted by the Cabinet before my mission left for India. It was not negotiated with the leaders of public opinion on India. It was a scheme formulated with the Government of India. It was based on certain theoretical considerations which prevent concessions unless they are to be scrapped. For instance, not only did we attempt to avoid unduly impairing the high efficiency produced by years of bureaucracy, but we endeavoured to avoid substituting Indian for British bureaucracy, and transferred to Indians no powers unless there was a reasonable prospect that the Indian peoples, through their electorate, could hold responsible those who wielded them. If parliamentary control was to be abandoned, Indian democratic control was to be substituted. There are many who hold that with this view we went too far. It is difficult to say that we could have gone further. We were also instructed that Parliament was to be the judge of each subsequent stage. The scheme based on these principles was accepted Avith gratitude by Moderates and was accepted, although stigmatised as unsatisfactory, by Extremists. Everybody was to work it. But. I fear that development on these lines, which might have been possible when the scheme was formulated, has been jeopardised by the general diffusion of the idea of self-determination throughout the world, and it looks as if there is a great school of thought which says, &quot;Let anybody, even Indians, govern themselves. It is their affair ; it is for them to make a mess of it.&quot; Writings and speeches on Ireland and Egypt from this point of view have materially affected the situation. If their influence on an impressionable people continues as strong as it seems likely to be in the immediate future, I must ask myself whether we shall be able to maintain the status quo for the 10 years originally designed.Meanwhile, the situation has been complicated by subsequent events, which have led a large section of Indian political opinion, instead of asking for a modification of the reforms scheme., to refuse to have anything to do with the steady development of opportunities granted by the British Parliament.5. First and foremost is the Peace with Turkey.  Indian views on this subject were listened to by the Cabinet and the Peace Conference with great patience.   The Peace 2512     100 10/20
ultimately concluded was not in conformity with the views either of the Indian Government or of British officials in India or of people in India who thought about such things. 1 put it to the Government oE India, and they have taken the line, that once the Peace was accepted by the Great Powers, it must be accepted by India, but I must analyse the feeling of Indians on this subject. Jt is based partly on a view, perhaps exaggerated, but undoubtedly well founded, that Turkey was largely beaten by Indian, troops. It is partly religious, and it is most genuinely religious in all probability when it takes the form of Objecting to the control of Palestine and Mesopotamia by non-Mohammedan Powers. But it is far more injured pride of race or creed, disheartenment at the disappearance of the last great Mohammedan Power. Tims the desire that the Turk should remain at Constantinople was partly religious. It was even more a fierce answer to the arguments so largely current in this country that the Turk,, Avhowas a Mohammedan, was not fit to remain in&apos;Europe. Now these two feelings, one religious and one creed and race consciousness, have been exploited by politicians, who in their turn have been exploited by anarchists and Bolsheviks. The Congress which decided against co-operation with the Government of India or the Imperial Government, demanded that this non-co-operation should continue until the Turkish Treaty was modified. This demand would seem absolutely impossible, and the remedies chosen fantastic. To refuse to co-operate with the Government of India which had sympathised with the Mohammedan position when the decision had been taken, not by that Government nor by the Home Government, but by the great Powers of the world and accepted by the Turkish Government, is ludicrous. If we prove that it is our desire and purpose not to annex territory which was Turkish as the result of our success, by taking prompt and effective steps to set up an Arab Government in Mesopotamia, the situation will be much improved. I would remind those who feel some impatience with Indian Mohammedans that the Treaty as concluded, which was designed to show some sympathy with Indian Mohammedans even in the teeth of a large body of public opinion in this country, has not as yet been carried out. And the Allies are in occupation of Constantinople and most of Anatolia is overrun by Greek troops. Let me hasten to say that this is not the fault of the Allies, but of Mustapha Kernel. It is nevertheless an added! sorrow to Indian Mohammedans.6. The next disquieting features are the ceaseless intrigues, not only of the Bolshevik Government in Moscow with its Asiatic Bureau, but of Bolshevism generally, by which I mean the enemies of ordered Government throughout the world, whose design it is to cause&apos; embarrassment to settled Governments in their most vulnerable points. It would seem as if funds were available and guidance offered to every centre of discontent in the British Empire,, at home just asinuch as in India. We have captured the orders of the Bolshevik Government to their agents to stir up trouble wherever they can. True Bolshevism, if it means the destruction of capitalism and the enthronement of communism, is doomed to failure in India, where, although the Labour Party do not seem to realise it, the Extremists are,, if anything, ultra-conservative. But the Bolsheviks of Switzerland, Germany, America, and Russia are exploiting every tendency, even pan-Islamism. Nothing is discarded which is likely to be of use to them. The Government of India have an excellent intelligence apparatus, and counter propaganda is being vigorously conducted by a special organisation. The Indian Princes, at any rate, have been brought closer to us than ever by this common danger. It is difficult to say whether the Afghans will not eventually throw off Bolshevik temptations and come into line with the British Government. But there is no doubt that Indian extremism, which up till recently was purely Indian and national, has now lent itself to international ramifications, which in their turn attempt to capture part of its machinery and which have as their motive the embarrassment of the British Government.7. Perhaps of all things the most important is the aftermath of the Punjab disturbances. There is a deep conviction, shared by Moderates and Extremists alike, that justice has not been done in the Punjab affair. Many people have been censured, hardly any of them have been punished. It is quite true that General Dyer is not to be employed any more, and that the Government and Parliament have declared, in unmistakable terms, their objection to what he did. But he had already been passed over for promotion and was likely to retire. His pension is a substantial one, and 17,0001. and upwards have been collected to keep him in comfort. I de not know how to convey to my colleagues the bitter feeling of dismay which is caused to Indians, who believed that he was guilty of brutality and of a determination to assert racial inferiority, by the tributes that have been paid to him, arid whatever be the explanation, the. House of Lords&apos; vote has done more than most things to cause trouble in India. But even, more than General Dyer, there is the position of Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer. I do not regret that,, at the wish of the Cabinet, His Majesty&apos;s Government thanked Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer for his services. Governor Eyre was similarly thanked, and when Ave realise how terrible was our need during the war, there can be no doubt that our thanks were due to Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer, who organised the Punjab war effort, which was the main Indian war effort. But he never took part in public controversy without insulting the educated Indian. He was reprimanded for one speech that he delivered. His method was not to attack individuals against whom some charge lay, but classes and methods whose aims he despised. Any number of Indians, well-disposed Indians, have told me that it was the thanks to Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer that
rankled most. One of the demands of the Congress which has decided on non-co-operation is some punishment of Sir Michael 0&apos;JDwyer. I say that is a demand which is fantastic and unintelligible. The Punjab incident is closed. We have said our say on consideration of all-the facts and of the evidence, and the matter cannot be reopened ; but the House of Lords and the public in England who refuse to accept the verdict of the Government of India, His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the Army Council, have much to answer for, and the effects of race-feeling, of the signs of a determination to fasten on any system to keep Indians under because they are Indians, will take years to remove. If any of my colleagues think of the isolation of Europeans in India, of the smallness of the British force in India, and realise that a campaign comparable to the Sinn Fein campaign in Ireland would be almost impossible to deal with except by punishment and revenge, certainly not by prevention, they will understand the danger of the situation which has been caused by the assertion of a force we do not in reality possess in preference to the doctrine of goodwill.I would remind the Cabinet in all seriousness that it is only in the Punjab that these disturbances were bad. In the North-West Frontier Provinces, where Sir George Roos-Keppel reigned, in the United Provinces, where Sir Haroourt Butler was in charge, in Bengal, in Bombay, there was no lasting difficulty at all. Riots occurred in the latter provinces, but there has been no question of the methods used to deal with them. I cannot help thinking that the speeches of Sir Michael OTJwyer have much to answer for.8. Arising out of the Punjab affair comes the question of the services. There is no doubt that we are failing to obtain recruits for the various Indian services, and this must cause the Government grave anxiety. Now I hold very strongly that if a policy is right it ought not to be deflected because of the opinions of a service or services. It is our business as a Government to decide the policy ; it is the duty of the services to carry it out; and, in my opinion, although Indians do not at present acknowledge it, the services in India are loyally accepting the new orientation. During the last 12 months, with indefatigable industry, the Government of India and my Council have been revising, with,! think, conspicuous liberality, the emoluments and the status of the Indian services. But there is no doubt that many retired Indian soldiers indeed, some on the active list and retired Indian civilians are doing their best to promote discontent in the services, to urge resignation and to prevent recruit-ment. When I was Under Secretary of State, Sir John Hewett told me to my consternation that he was urging all his friends not to join an Indian service. I would not quote this if he had not quoted it in public. Quite rightly in my opinion, we have decided to proceed against any Indians who use their influence to stop recruitment for the Indian Army. - In this moment of India&apos;s need it is hardly less lamentable that people who owe their position in the world to India should be doing their best to oppose the efforts of the Government by using all their influence to deprive us of recruits for the Indian services.9. Another disquieting feature is the strikes that are occurring all over India, mainly in the Presidency towns. I am satisfied that the Governors are doing their best. Conciliation Boards and Arbitration Boards are being set up. I am not yet quite clear how far there is a political significance in these strikes. But their main cause is undoubtedly the fact that Indian labour is wretchedly underpaid, and works and lives in wretched conditions; and also that Indian trade unions, which have only just come into being, are, characteristically, telescoping history in their methods. Instead of following the great efforts of British trade unions to ameliorate the social conditions of their members in the pre-war epoch, they tend rather to ape the conditions of British trade unionism to-day. Owing to their immaturity, their imitativeness and their weakness of organisation, they enter on strikes with levity and without sense of proportion in their objects ; and consequently a spirit is fostered among the strikers which the political agitator is not slow to use for his own. ends.10. Next I must call the Cabinet&apos;s attention to the treatment meted out to Indians in the new constitution granted by the Colonial Office to Kenya. Indians hold that it is by their work that this Colony had reached its present development. Both Indians and English are colonists. India resents very strongly the fact that, notwithstanding our protestations of partnership within the Empire as a goal in the new constitution, the Indian electorate is only to have two seats on the Legislative Council, and the policy of racial segregation is to be pursued. The treatment of Indians in South Africa has long been a burning grievance in India ; but the Indian Governments answer has always been that they were powerless, that South Africa was self-governing. East Africa is not self-governing, and 1 not not know how to commend to India the steps which Lord Milner has taken. No doubt he had to consider the feelings of English colonists, but I do not hesitate to say that of recent and provocative causes, the racial segregation, the prohibition of holding land in the most salubrious quarters of a province, of owning property in the best quarters of the town, which Lord Milner has found himself powerless to prevent, is the most potent for evil on the Indian landscape.11. Lastly, there is the Egyptian example what Egypt has gained by the methods that its leaders have pursued. But I will not deal with this further here because I have dealt with, it in a separate paper.
The result is that the Turkish Treaty, the Punjab trouble and East Africa have produced what did not exist three years ago a Sinn Fein party in India.Now this description is a gloomy one. Yet I for one am gratified that with all these sources of trouble the outlook is not so gloomy as might be thought. My colleagues will have heard that the Congress which met at Calcutta last month decided on Mr. Gandhi&apos;s policy of non-co-operation. Mr. Gandhi is a man of the highest character and the most disinterested motives. He has, I think, something like a love for passive resistance or non-co-operation for its own sake. He preached it in South Africa with success. He tried it last year as a protest against the Rowlatt Act. When its results were seen he repented of it, and undoubtedly assisted the authorities in restoring order. He determined upon it as a consequence of the Turkish Treaty, and determined upon it with equal vigour as a consequence of the Hunter Committee Report and the action taken thereon. These facts show, to my mind, that it is not so much the cause but the action which commends itself to him. I would ask my colleagues not to take this determination too seriously. There were over 5,000 delegates at the Congress which met at Calcutta ; 2,000 of these came from Bengal. The process of selecting delegates is in no sense representative. 53 per cent, of the delegates never voted, and it is only out of the 47 per cent, minority vote that two-thirds voted for non-co-operation. Already as a result, the moderates have gained new strength and are condemning non-co-operation with a courage which is gratifying.The non-co-operation programme includes the boycott of the new legislatures. It is easy to retire from electoral contests if you think you are not going to be elected. Already there is talk of a new Congress in December which is to reverse the decision of the Congress at Calcutta. Some men are leaving the Congress as a result of the decision, others are resigning their candidature for the new Councils out of loyalty to the Congress, but with an expression of their disbelief in its policy. I cannot disguise from myself the hope that the new Councils will be saner by the absence of the extremist, and that the Congress influence will be largely destroyed. It is a Congress which has already shed its moderate members; they seceded from it when our reforms report was originally published. Next January we shall have candidates elected by democratic vote with a power to pass resolutions. It will be easy to ignore the resolutions of the Congress, a purely debating body representing Only one school of opinion, with the observation that if the Congress really represented the people their members would have found places in the Legislative Councils, where they could make their voice effective. The Government of India and the Local Governments are not dismayed, and I would hope that my colleagues will not take the Congress too seriously.I think it may be asked why it is that the Government has not proceeded against Gandhi and his associates. Now, I have always made a point, with which I am sure my colleagues will agree, of leaving to the local authorities the enforcement of law and order. The answer to the question is that Lord Chelmsford and his Government have deliberately embarked upon a policy of allowing non-co-operation to make itself ridiculous. It was a gamble,&apos; but it has met with considerable success. Direct action which, after all, is what non-co-operation amounts to for the purpose of enforcing some new policy or new action upon the Government is intelligible. Direct aclion in a form which debars those who participate in it from ihe opportunity of influencing policy, and adopted not for the purpose of enforcing some new demand, but as a protest against what is over and clone with, is not likely to commend itself to practical people. I can only say that I have not yet seen anybody who would have recommended action against Gandhi. Let it be remembered that, so far as my experience goes, extra-legal action in India has rarely been successful; and as regards legal action process of the law courts, Gandhi has done nothing yet which, according to the legal advice which the Government of India have received, would ensure a conviction.I can only quote three opinions. Sir George Lloyd is firm in his opinion that nothing has happened this year which ought to have resulted in action against Gandhi. The Secretary of the European Association in India, a strong political opponent of mine, acknow-ledged to me that nobody Avho knew the facts would recommend extra-legal executive action against Gandhi. Lord Willingdon wrote me a private letter in scathing terms, stating that Gandhi was coming to his province of Madras, that he had asked the Government of India to prevent his coining, and that the Government of India had refused. The warmth of his letter impressed me, and I told him in answer that in my opinion action against Gandhi was one thing, action against Gandhi in Madras, and in Madras only, was another. By the very next mail Lord Willingdon wrote to me that Gandhi had come and gone, that his meetings were pooily attended, that as a result one Mohammedan had surrendered his Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, and that two barristers who had no practice had announced their intention of ceasing to practise; and he added that he had to confess that the Government of India&apos;s policy was right,E.
