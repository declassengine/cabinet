REPORT BY FOOD CONTROLLER.1NFIDENTIAL ^Referen0e Oabin0t 25 ^20&apos;* Conclusion 6 (a).My last report on the sale of Australasian Meat by my Department was dated 1st September 1920* (C*P.1821).lf STOCKS. The stock position as at 25th September is shown on the attached schedule.2.     CONSUMPTION.Sales of Imported Meat for Consumption.Week	ended	Total Sales. Tons.	Australasian. Meat. Tons.	S.American.

It has been assisted to some extent by small regular exports to the Continent.   For the thirteen weeks ended 18th September the consumption of Australasian Mutton and Lamb alone has reached a total of 77,663 tons, an average of 6,000 tons per week, or in excess of the pre-war rate of consumption.3* ABROAD.    The stock sheet shows that about 12,700 tonsof New Zealand Mutton and Lamb havo been sold to North America but have not yet been shipped.About 5,000 tons of Patagonian Mutton have been sold to France.
4* FORWARD SALES. (a) A provisional sale of the whole of the Beef in New Zealand, approximately 33,000 tons, has been made at prices which have received Treasury sanction.   These prices are:-First Grade Ox Beef    5^d per lb, f*o.b.Second   &quot;      11    &quot;      5d    &quot;    &quot;      &quot;First Grade Oow Beef  4^d  n    ,r      wSecond  *      M    M     4d    M    tt      &quot;Bull Beef and Boners  3fd  &quot;    &quot;      &quot; These prices are slightly under the equivalent prices which are being asked in this country, but in spite of recent reductions in prices here, the sale of Cow and Bull Beef has been difficult and slow, and has only reached 250 tons per week.   Moreover the future prospects for dealing with this Beef in this country were not promising, and reductions of&apos;2d per lb in Oow Beef and 3d per lb in Bull Beef had proved insufficient to meet the competition of Brazilian and South African Beef.The sale is subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the Australasian Tonnage Committee for the lifting of the beef by the introduction of vessels which are not normally in the Australasian trade.   If these arrangements are achieved, as appears likely, the lifting of the Mutton will be materially expedited.(b) A further sale has been made of all the New Zealand Cut $wes as they arrive in this country at 6d per lb, ex store.  The button is to be exported, and the price is better than the current price, as no commissions or railage will be incurred.I     (c) A further sale of 20,000 New Zealand Cow Fore Quarters Beef ex store in this country has been made.   The price is to be 5id per lb, ex store, and the meat is to be exported.   The price is slightly better than the equivalent price for Fore Quarters sold in New Zealand.(d) A further sale of 920 tons Beef now in this country has been made for export to France at the equivalent of current prices.
(e) Further negotiations are in progress for the sale of all the New Zealand Beef and all the Australian Beef afloat and in this country.5*   ^TERMINATION Off CONTRACTS    The Government of the Common-wealth of Australia cabled stating their inability to arrive at agreement with the various States Governments as to the date on which the purchase contracts should terminate and suggesting that the Imperial Government should open negotiations with the States Governments direct.   This course has been adopted as it is highly desirable that the contracts should be terminated before the new season opens.   The States in question are Hew South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and Victoria has already agreed to the contract terminating on 31st October.6.   NSW SEASONS MEAT FROM KEW ZEALAND.    Negotiations with theNew Zealand Government have resulted in the decision that thequestion of the allocation of tonnage space for the shipment of free meat to the United Kingdom will not be considered  until october.   Free meat may, however, be shipped to North Americaprovided it is carried in non-British tonnage, or to destinationsother than the United Kingdom or North America provided also thatone-third of the cargo consists of meat purchased from the ImperialthatGovernment for/purpose.Notification has been issued to the New Zealand Government and to the trade  here that offers for the purchase of Imperial Government meat now in New Zealand on conditions to be prescribed will receive consideration.7.&apos; RABBITS.    The stock of Rabbits which had been purchased for the Army and which was taken over from the Board of Trade has not hitherto figured in these reports.   This stock had been reduced to about 150,000 cases, which were selling only very slowly.   An offer to purchase the whole quantity was received, and Treasury sanction being obtained, a sale was completed at 3- d per lb, less  ]
Vfo for the whole of the rabbits which would pass inspection, The sale involves a considerable loss on the original cost, but in view of the condition of the rabbits, their unsuitability for this market and the heavy storage charges, the advantages appeared to lie entirely on the side of a sale in bulk to cut this War loss.CHAISES   A.
