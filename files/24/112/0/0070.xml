There has bean friction between tho men and their leaders and the power of the leaders to exercise a restraining influence is limited.    The leaders will confer again to-morrow and hope in the meantime that the Government will approach the Executive.Apart from increasing unemployment, with attendant unrest, the most serious faofox is the growing violence of communist speeches.   Extracts of those are given and it is becoming imperative that step% be taken to check these advocates of lawlessness.. A demonstration of London unemployed is being-arranged for Monday nextLabour organisers are concentrating on the municipal elections and unless the connection between labour councils and swollen rate3 be emphasised, their activity is likely to be rewarded.The Manchester engineers have now agreed to remove the ban on overtime and the district committees have withdrawn their resignations.The Amalgamated Engineering Union has decided by ballot not to invest in the first Debentures of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.There is grave unrest among the railwaymen and it is reported that lire Cramp wishes to resign from the Railway Advisory Committee.There/
There is evidence of great depression among the leading Sinn Feiners in Ireland, and the arrest of Symmington with plans of the Irish Office on him has alarmed the Sinn Feiners in England.
THB OOiX MINERSIs forecast in my last report, the miners have rejeotedthe datum line proposals, the figures beingAgainst 635,098Sor 181,488Majority against        453,670Hostility to the datum line is due to three oauses;antagonism to any conorete relation of wages to output, a feeling that under this scheme the benefit will not godirectly to the individual concerned, but will be shared byabsentees, and lastly, misunderstanding.The livelihood of a national strike is considerable;it is possible, however, that the leaders, who have beenvery generally condemned by the men for having &quot;made a mess&quot;of the negotiations, will make a further effort to evade a strike.If a strike be ordered, it will probably not be onthe datum line, but on the wages claim; there can scarcely &quot;bea question of the 14s. 2d. reduction, as it has been sho?mthat the amount of the surplus, alleged by the miners to beavailable, does not exist.A majority of the miners is undoubtedly opposed to astrike and if a strike takes place disintegration of thenational federation will probably set in: on the other hand,it is practically &quot;certain that unless there is a hope thatthe 2s. increase can be secured by negotiation within a few&quot; ..&quot;!&quot;.&apos;.&apos;        flj , :      A V,       .   .    - .&apos; ..&apos;,!.:!       if -    &quot;&quot;&apos; .        .&quot;&apos;Iweeks, sectional strikes will.occur in South Wales, Lancashire and Cheshire and parts -of Scotland.  .There seems little fear that the railwayman and transport workers would come out in support of the miners; Mr. Thomas stated recently that not 5,000 of his men would obey an order to strike, while Mr. Robert Williams stated that he could not depend on the dockers.The/
The general public is becoming impatient of repeated crises and of tho enormous financial loss which industry suffers in consequence; it is, nevertheless, firmly behind the Government and opposed to any concession to the miners. South wales in spite of determined antagonism to the datum line, the strike feeling is waning in some parts of this coalfield.   The men are of opinion that negotiations will be resumed.Considerable activity prevails among extremists in the Bhondda Valley, who anticipate tret revolution will result from tho crisis.   A committee has accordingly been formed to take over the following pits, inter alia. Cambrian, Clydach Vale (4,000), the I&apos;aval, Penygraig&apos;(8,750 men), the Glamorgan, Ilwynypia (3,500), the Bodringallt, Tstrad (400), Maindy and Sastem, Ton Pentre (1,500), Oelli, Ystrad (450), Pare and Dare, Cwmparc (2,80p) and the Abergorki, Treorchy (1,700).Secret meetings of this committee are being held at Tonypandy and Treorchy, to which only revolutionaries equipped with a pass word are admitted. Lancashire, end CheshireThe attitude of the great majority of men in this coalfield is &quot;Two shillings Increase or a strike&quot;.   They would, however, probably agree to a further postponement of notices, in preference to an immediate strike, if theyawere still hopes of getting the Se. by negotiation.   Mr. 3millie&apos;s advice has fallen on deaf ears and the men say that he has sold them.The following circular, signed by the officials, has been Issued by the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; federation:-*&quot;Before you reoord your vote the Officials and Agents of the Federation desire to advise the members against the acceptance of the datum line for the regulation of wages as embodied in the proposals of the employees.&quot;It is a vicious principle which although offering a slight advantage in the present, is fraught with the gravest danger to the future interests of the xraderground miner.&quot;Though/
* &quot;Though stated to he only a temporary expedient to settle the present dispute, it would he almost impossible to escape from the consequences of such procedure once established for the-regulation of wages.   Life long experience in such matters convinoes us beyond a shadow of doubt that nothing but evil can result from the application of such a principle.&quot;You are therefore advised to vote against the acceptance of the employers1 proposals.&quot;Northumberland and DurhamThe special oounoil meeting of the NorthumberlandMiners&apos; Association rejected by 55 votes to 45 theowners1 offer, but by 64 votes to 7 instructed delegateswho attend to-day&apos;s conference to propose that the wagesquestion be referred to an impartial tribunal.   The mendo not want to strike, but are convinced that they areentitled to the 2s. increase.YorkshireThere is considerable friction in this area and strong opposition to the datum line and to Mr. Herbert Smith and his colleagues.   The delegate meeting of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association is descjibed as having been &quot;a veritable bear garden&quot; which lasted for five hours and was obiefly taken up with personal bickering. The men do not favour reference of their claims&apos; to a tribunal. MidlandsThe Midland miners do not appear to understand the datum line but are opposed to any system which renders wages dependent on output,   ily correspondent reports that the men all say &quot;We want more nay but wo don11 went more work.&quot;   They ore incensed with thoir executives, whom they aocuse of not showing; fight is the negotiations.Leicestershire Miners1 Association rdvocttes refersnce of the disoute to a tribunal. scotland the majority of miners in rifeshire, Stirlingshire,Lanarkshire/
m c*Lanarkshire and the lothions have disregarded LIr. Smillie&apos;s advice and the organisation of unofficial workers committees is proceeding in Lanarkshire.   Many of the leading communistiil are actively working for revolution and cases of intimidation by the &quot;Bed Guard&quot; have occurred.   Offioials of the miners  unions, on tho other hand, have in several cases scarcely obtained a hearing.   Sectional unofficial strikes, aooompanied by looting, are expected.UTOffLOYMSMTReports from the majority of industrial centres and from ports indicate increasing unemployment, with a corresponding growth of unrest.   Speakers are urging that the situation would be alleviated by the resumption of trade with Russia.   With sol skill they choose a theme to suit their audience, explaining ti instance to Leicester that Russia needs boots, to Coventry thai machinery is wanted and to Yorkshire that tho cloth which Russl requires would provide employment for all t&apos;..e textile workers.!The strike of shipwrights in Liverpool has added to the   1 ranks of the unemployed who ere reported to number 50,000 in Lancashire and Cheshire.A special meeting, oonvened by the Coventry branch of the tailgameted Engineering Union held to consider the questioj of unemployment in the industry was attended by only 5550 men j although the local membership is 13,000. It was agreed to makl a voluntary levy on working members of 2s. 6d. weekly, a?irent! paying 1b. A shorter working week m from tioi-efrber let was all proposed.London Labour Bayors are making a i3:reat show of dealing with unemployment, but, so far, they have not gone beyond the I stage of meetings.   A large demonstration is to be held on Monext/m
o n onext, October 18th, when the Mayors will form a deputation to the Prime Minister.THE COMMUNISTSThe Communists have at last   one common meeting ground, the exploitation of unemployment; their attitude is summed up in the phrase &quot;Workers&apos;, seize control of your industries.&quot; Unemployment is rapidly replacing Russia as the subject of extremist speeches and makes a greater appeal to audiences.The miners1 dispute occasions alternating waves of hope and despair in the ranks of the communists; MacManus and Ihkpin have issued, on behalf of their party, &quot;An open letter to the Miners&quot;, in which they state that &quot;the miners have been defeated&quot; and that&quot; &quot;the Triple Alliance is in the main run by Reformist Leaders.&quot;   They urge the men to &quot;Remember that the owners will fool you unless you get oontrol.   Remember that reformist leaders will shrink back at the last minute and choose men who, understanding that a strike may lead to revolution, will not on that account shrink back.&quot;The refusal of the Labour Party Executive to accept the affiliation of the Communist Party of Great Britain has not disposed of the matter; revolt is reported in the local Labour parties of Balham, Dartford, Hampstead, Holborn, Islington, Paddington^ Tooting, Arnold (Hotts.), Ruddersfield and Reading which, in consequence of extremist majorities, refused to obey the Executive.During the week-end Yorkshire communists held a divisional conference at Sheffield to discuss organisation.; it was decided to take full advantage of unemployment and to contest municipal seats, if necessary, in opposition to the official Labour ce&amp;ididates.Increased/
Increased activity is reported among communists in ^Birmingham, who intend to follow the example of the Coventry extremists and march to factories whioh are still working. There is very little trade union support for the oomnunist groups and the Birmingham Co-operative Society has refused to support the candidature oi one of their members at the municipal eleotion.Remington, a leading Leicester communist, has just returns from Brussels, where he addressed meetings of engineers oh industries Re has shown signs of unusual affluence since his return.Some members of Guy Aldred1s communist group have been in the Rosyth district with the &quot;Bakunin Van&quot;, a caravan decorated with the Industrial Workers of the World slogan, in which the-   A .  &apos;&quot;missionaries&quot; apparently travel.2inoviev, on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Thir,   .,   &apos;f    .;.... s      &apos;;     C&apos; :&apos;-r &amp;    *&apos;f &apos;-**v-&apos;      &amp; v. *-iJ    Y&apos; -International, has addressed to communists in Sngland, Prance,Germany and America a circular dealing with the well wornsubject of Parliamentarism.   Although this document contains no new matter, the following passage bears quotation:&quot;The following points are neoessary for a revolutiona, party:- &apos; *(1)   That the main fight be carried on outside Parliament by strikes, risings and other forms of mass action.(2)   That the action in Parliament should be closely connected with this fight.(3)   That the Deputies should also render illegal aotiviti(4)   That they aot in a-disciplinary manner under orders from headquarters.(5)   That they pay no attention to the Parliamentary formalities nor fear to. come in conflict with the bourgeois majority about speeches, etc.&quot;In spite- .of the active propaganda of the returned stowawayinterest in Bolshevism ,due Bolshevism appears to be declining.It is significant that Jack fanner, who is pledged publicly tosupport the Russian regime, says privately that there is hardlyany/
any freedom in Russia and that he thinks that the Bolsheviks will be swept out of office as soon as peaoe with Poland is accomplished,YIOU3NT SPEECHESThe following extracts are taken from typical communist epoeohes made during the week end: &apos;H. Shopperson, municipal candidate&apos;for the City Council, saidat Birmingham on October 10th:-&quot;OomradeB, the Capitalist Class are afraid of us and more than that, we are&apos; going to put the fvar of God into them before we have done.   I think I will tell you at this stage what we of the Communist Party are going to do next week. ... We will arrange a great march similar to that whioh happened at Corentry and march to a number of factories and take control.   We don&apos;t want any looting of shops, hut what we want is the factories that are stocked up with commodities of life to he taken possession fcf and distributed to the people who are in want.11R,. V. Harvey, secretary of the Birmingham branch of theCommunist Party of Great Britain, said on Octobor 8th, 1980;&quot;The aim of eur Party is to overthrow the present thieves kitchen tf capitalists and to form a Soviet Government similar to that of Russia.   We of the revolutionary communist party want to have nothing to do with laws, wages, prisons, workhouses, rich and poor, rent, interest, profits and property, which is all capitalism.  Comrades, under Sovietism all these will be abolished. (Cheers). ... Comrades, we of the Communist Party are on the Job,   We are obtaining available information from the shops and the factories.   We are ascertaining the opinion of the workers from the manager to the errand hoy on the vital problems of the day.   We are actually in possession of nearly all accounts and records and we only want your assistanoe in order to take over the vfaols conoern.   (Cheers),   friends, join our party and the workers will very soon be able to own and oontrol.   (Cries of Moar, hear1 and clapping of hands).&quot;James Stewart. Midland organiser of the Communist party of Great Britain, who has recently been aotive in Coventry,said at the same meeting:&quot;Comrades and friends, you have all heard what I did in Coventry and I am going to do the same here next week. ... I don&apos;t oare a damn for the authorities (Cheers) and, Comrades, if you like we can hold a meeting down the road where the bluebottles are (Cheers and clapping of hands).
I have been in prison and I can go again, but if you say that I should not go to prison then I won&apos;t. Damn the rotten bluebottles and the authorities. IfilI111 show them what I can do (Cheers).   Comrades, after the meeting we will then march and take over a number of the factories.   Get ready and it will be a very easy matter.   (Cries of &quot;We are reedy&quot;).&quot;THE CO-OPERATIVE movement the total figures of the eight divisional Co-operative wholesale Society meetings, which have discussed theresolution of the Left Wing group, are ^Por 1209Against 1112Majority for 97This resolution, to which I have referred in previous reportsinstructs the directors of the Co-operative Wholesale Societyto consult with the Executive of the Co-operative Party asto the assistance which oan be given by the former body tofurther the policy of the party as laid down at the BristolCongress, and to report to the quarterly meetings in Januaryi92i;      :   ;;&apos;;;,r 2,,^ 111The voting indicates that Labour efforts to capture co-operative machinery are meeting with some Buocess.The Co-operative,Wholesale Society report showed a loss of  132,288, as the result of the half year&apos;s trading. Investments by trade unions in the Co-operative Wholesale Bank amount to  1,240,000 and by individuals to  173,000 (current accounts).THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY,The working man&apos;s objection to paying for his politios is once more proved by an Independent Labour Party circular which states that &quot;the time has now come for our annual      0 Special Effort Appeals and proceeds with increasing gloom &quot;for the first sis months of this year the Read Officeexpenditure/
expenditure has exceeded the income by  1,244, 8,0.   The expenses of the last Annual Conference exceeded the reoeipts by nearly  300 which has to be met from the Head Office funds.   The expenditure and salaries, printing and stationery, postage and travelling, is constantly increasing, and the increase on these items alone seems likely to absorb the whole of the increased income from affiliation fees.&quot;The National Administrative Council has now taken over the financial responsibility for the Information Committee, and this involves an expenditure of  1,000 a year.&quot;The National Administrative Council is apparently as loath to part with its money as are the members, for the Appeal continues:   &quot;The last conference of the Labour Party decided to raise the affiliation foes by one penny per member and this involves a oharge upon the funds of the Independent Labour Party of  150 a year.&quot;Nevertheless, the officials do not propose to curtail the good time which they are alleged to have at the expense of the organisation:   &quot;The present critical condition of home and foreign affairs makes it imperative that there should be more frequent meetings of the National Administrative Council and the increase of railway fares and hotel charges makes such meetings very expensive.   But we are confident that the branches would not wish the efficiency of the movement to suffer through inadequate means at the disposal of the Bead Office.&quot;BX-SEBVICB MENMeetings of Ex-Service men have been held in various parts of the Metropolis, but the attendance has in some oasesbeen/
been small.   On October 8th Jones Bald at Harlesden::   wWe are out to abolish this rfotten system of &quot;Isociety by a social revolution.   We are out to agitate upon every platform of sooial activity.   We are out to form and organise tho Rod Army in this country for the specific purpose of taking ovor the means of production, distribution and exchange.   We are expounding revolutionary propaganda, and we are revolutionary and red right up to the hilt.   So let it be understood that we,are rank red socialists out to bring about a social revolution, out to abolish this misery, unemployment, degradation and starvation&quot;with which we are surrounded at the present time..&apos;!On October 6th, 8,000 ex-Servioe. men demonstrated at Liverpool under the auspices of the Merseyside Oounoil of the National -federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers..  A resolution was passed calling upon the Lord Mayor to convene a meeting,of employers, trade union officials and representatives of the men, with a View to finding some solution of the unemployment problem.   It was notioeable that although some&quot; banners bore the inscription &quot;Employers must find work for us&quot;, (others d eclared that &quot;Trade Unions must oonsider the Ex-Servioe Men.&quot;  Although 10,000 men are said to be unemployed, the feeling among them has improved slightly, owing to steps being taken to find work for them. , * - i&amp;fit  is reported that the Glasgow headquarters of the International Union of Ex-Servioe Men will be unable to send a delegate to the Milan International conference, unless outside branches pay their dues.The bricklayers feel very strongly about the reported soheme to use unemployed ex-Service men: to build houses. They say that the Government intends to flood the industry with &quot;dilutees&quot; and the whole scheme is a blow at them and, that they will strike if suoh a soheme is put into operation. They are very impatient at the deiay in settling their demand for 3s. an hour.THE/
JBI &quot;dam RiilRALD&quot;In spite of the claim that the &quot;Twopenny Daily Herald.&quot; goes like.&quot;hot oakes&quot; the paper finds It neoessary to devote columns eaoh day to self advertisement.   Contributions as small as 7s. 6d. have been acknowledged, although it is claimed that &quot;sums too numerous to acknowledge in detail&quot; have been reoeived. The sums acknowledged have been far less, both in number and amount, than was the ease after the November appeal.   The Amalgamated Engineering Union has decided by 45,934 votes to 41,083 not to invest in the First Debentures, and a Yorkshire Miners&apos; Lodge, while deciding to send  30 as a first Instalment, prudently adds that the money will not be forthcoming until after the miners1 crisis.Weeks of propaganda in the pages of the post officeworkers1 Journal have resulted in a contribution of only  100.hadThe recent disclosures have/an unexpected effetft in Sweden.   Messrs. Strom, Lundquist and Grimlund have all, protested in the Press their entire innocence; the Svenska Randels Bank has declined either to affirm or deny the statement that tliey forwarded money to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, hut the-result of all the publicity has been tt render StrOm&apos;8 chances of election to his constituency very doubtful and generally to discredit the extreme Left throughout the country.Ho attempt has yet been&apos;made to transfer the Exohequer Bonds purchased by Francis Meynell. TOM DHGLBY &quot;      r.   in    mi mm mmgx j p.............following a recent oampaign in South Wales, the shop steward Dingley has now returned to Coventry where he is assuming the leadership of the unemployed.   He is standing as the &quot;Workers. Council&quot; candidate for the All Saints ward of Coventry and states that he is confident pf election, adding &quot;I am a real rebel, and Coventry will know it before long.,&quot;.SOT/
Force/       !Sim ffHS IN GREAT britain during the week the usual Sinn Fein meetings have &quot;been held in the London area, also oonoerts to raise money for the North Wall men.On October 10th the Trafalgar Square demonstration was attended by about 5,000 people; there was considerable disorder at times, owing to the fact that any person who disagreed with the speakers was surrounded by organised groups and hustled out of the meeting.   Attempts were made to mcb a member of the audience who waved a Union Jack. The speeches were merely a   re-statement of Sinn Fein views.A man named Baird, from Belfast, has arrived in &quot;Yorkshire, where he intends to remain for some weeks, canvassing the trade unions on behalf of the Belfast Sinn Feiners.IRELANDThe number of outrages reported shows a decrease, for the fourth week in. succession, in those political crimes directly attributable to Sinn Eein.   Too maoh importance should not be attached to this decrease as undoubtedly many crimes are not reported at all and the polios stations are becoming fewer and more isolated.   A large part of the decrease is due to the falling off in arms raids by Sinn Feiners; they have probably by this time secured the majority of the old guns and revolvers scattered about the country.   Of the 200 outrages reported 150 were directly attributable to Sinn Fein, only three were of en agrarian nature and 47 were miscellaneous cases of non-political crime.The chief activities of Sinn Fein are still directed against the Royal Irish Constabulary; two members of the
tforoe were murdered during the week.   Three polioe barracks were attacked but successfully defended and one vaoated barrack, two courthouses and one ooastguard station were burned.   There were 46 oases of robbery of mails end 19 oases of raiding for arms by armed and masked men.   Six persons were kidnapped by Sinn Feinore and there were three oases of murder other than those of police.In some counties police officers are of opinion that the worst is over and that many of the followers of Sinn Fein are only prevented from breaking away by fear of assassination. It 1b beyond question that the vast mass of the people are sick  and tired of tho whole thing.Regrettable as they have been, the reprisals in some places have proved a decided deterrent.The &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; this week publishes a statement covering the whole of the back page of the paper showing the position of the Bail Kireann Loan to date.   In spite of the length of time which this collection has been in progress and the intimidation employed only about  370,000 is said to have been collected to date; of this nearly half comes from the Province of Munster.There was no change in the railway or industrial situation during the week.
