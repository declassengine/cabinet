[This Document is the Property of His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government] ^CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.France /Oil.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.ASSUMING, as it now seems tolerably safe to do, that M. Millerand is elected President of the French Republic, that event will possess for France arid for the countries having relations with her as allies, as recent enemies or otherwise, an importance greater perhaps than that of any Presidential election which has happened under the Third Republic. For M. Millerand will be the first President who has been elected (a) as an exponent of an executive policy abroad and at home; and (6) as an advocate of a definite strengthening of the position of the President of the Republic in the working of the Republican Constitution.There can be no doubt that the movement which has been so rapidly developed within the very brief period which lias elapsed since M. Deschanel&apos;s resignation for summoning M. Millerand to the Elys^e is primarily due to the satisfaction which his foreign policy has given to the amour-propre of the French nation. There is a prevailing feeling that he has succeeded by carefully considered and judicious steps in delivering France from an undue dependence upon England as regards the enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles, and by giving effective expression to French sympathy with Poland in contributing&apos; to the building up of a solid barrier between Bolshevik Russia and Central and Western Europe. It is of course arguable that the successes obtained in these respects are more apparent than real. But in French opinion they are genuine as well as conspicuously apparent, and M. Millerand, as being their author, is regarded as deserving of the highest reward that the nation can give him a reward the bestowal of which has been rendered possible by the unfortunate accident of the break-down in M. Deschanel&apos;s health.During the course of the rapid movement of opinion above referred to objection was taken to the proposed elevation of M. Millerand to the Presidency of the Republic by thoughtful writers, notably in the &quot; Journal des Debats&quot; and the &quot; ficho de Paris,&quot; on the ground that, at any rate as the present French Republican Constitution has hitherto been interpreted, this recognition of M. Millerand&apos;s services would be wanting in logic and in propriety, inasmuch as he would find himself in a more exalted position indeed, but far less able to give effect to his foreign policy than he has been as President of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs. This was clearly M. Millerand&apos;s own original view of the situation. He not only strongly deprecated the proposed elevation, but distinctly refused to stand as a candidate for the Presidency of the Republic on the ground that he could, in his belief, serve the country better as President of the Council of Ministers. Whether this attitude was absolutely genuine it is impossible to say, but the language in which the refusal was reported to be framed seemed to ring true. Steady pressure, however, exerted for two or three days by the press and by influential politicians, sufficed to bring M. Millerand to a different mind to the position at any rate of willingness to allow himself to be put in nomination if it was clearly understood that, in becoming a candidate for the Presidency, his object was to further the general policy set forth in his electoral speech in November. As to this, his declaration on the 21st September was quite frank and straightforward; its terms, which are worth reproducing, are as follows: &quot; In my speech of the 7th November last -1 defined the policy of social progress, of order, labour and union, represented in foreign affairs, by the integral . application of the Treaty of Versailles and the defence of the principles on which it is based, in agreement with our Allies; in&quot; home affairs, by upholding the organic laws of the Republic, the Restoration and development of all our economic powers, decentralisation, and, at the proper moment, the amendment of our constitutional laws, that experience has proved necessary. For the past eight months, supported by the confidence of Parliament, I have defended and carried out this policy in a methodical and continuous manner. I think, and I have given reasons for my opinion, that I can nowhere serve this policy more usefully than 312   [4422]
as Premier. - Nevertheless, if the majority of both Chambers prefers my presence at the lillysee to uphold and to continue this national policy; if, like me, the majority thinks that the President of the Eepublic, while he ought never to be a party man, can and ought to be a man with a policy, drawn up and carried out in close collaboration with his Ministers, I shall not decline the appeal of the national representatives.&quot;Unfortunately, no verbatim report of what has thus become M. Millerand&apos;s historic speech of the 7th November is available.    The &quot;Temps&quot; of the 9th November summarises very briefly the part of the speech relating to the reform of the Constitution. &quot;The speaker,&quot; so the report runs, &quot;signalised, the inconveniences of the political organisation ....... the confusion.of powers, the. absence of responsibility, the instabilityOf Ministries &apos; a . detestable system,&apos; said he. He advocated for the election of the President of.the Eepublic a more enlarged electoral college, and for the Senate a mode of election based on the representation of economic interests.&quot; From other reports it appears that M. Millerand m the passage in question maintained that Parliament hud for a long time past usurped from time to time the attributions and rights .of the Executive; further, that, the, President had become.&quot; the Syndic of Parliamentarians,&quot; whereas he was.in reality the representative of France, and that, therefore, he should be elected, not only by Parliament, but by delegates of other representative sections of the State. This was followed by a passage on decentralisation-tion fully reported in the &quot; Temps,&quot; which, though very interesting, need not be enlarged upon in this memorandum.No objection appears to have been taken to the suggestion of reforms&apos; in the direction of decentralisation. But the changes which M. Millerand was understood to have in view in connection with the election of a President of the Republic and a readjustment or redistribution of .the powers of the State, as between the President and the two branches of the Legislature, were seized upon by a considerable body of politicians consisting of the Radicals and the Radical Socialists within and without the Senate and the Chamber as pointing towards a.dangerous enhancement of the authority of the Head of the State. Steps were at once taken to organise an opposition to the election of M. Millerand, and.at the dress rehearsal of the Presidential election on the 22nd September 270 votes were mustered by this opposition against the 528 cast for H.. Millerand as President. In the meantime M. Millerand had. issued a further statement of which, though it did not disarm the opposition to his election, account must be carefully taken. This statement is reported in somewhat varying terms, but its effect seems to be that, while he, thought a revision of the Constitution necessary, it would have to be postponed until after steps had been taken for the economic and financial rehabilitation of the country, and meanwhile much could.be done by a better interpretation and adaptation of the terms of the Constitution with a view to making, the action of the President more, effective in the conduct of foreign affairs and in, assuring continuity in foreign policy. He pointed out in particular that clause. 8 of the Constitutional Law of the 16th July, 1875, placed among the powers of the President, of the Republic that of negotiating&apos;and ratifying treaties. The clause in question -proceeds to state that the President must acquaint the Chambers of treaties so negotiated and ratified by him &quot;as soon as the interest and the safety of the State * allow it.&quot; Treaties of peace or of commerce, treaties involving the finances of the State, those which relate to the position and the rights-.of property of French subjects abroad do not become definitive until after having been voted by the two Chambers,, nor can any cession, exchange or addition of territory take effect except in virtue of a, law. It may be added that clause 9 of the Constitutional Law of the 16th July, 1875, which follows that just cited, lays down that the President of the Republic cannot; declare war without the previous assent of the two Chambers.It is stated by the correspondent of the &quot; Times &quot; that he can recall no President who has had the courage to avail himself of the right to negotiate and ratify treaties. It seems clear, however, that without any revision of the Constitution the clause giving him that power may be used without offence by a President elected like M. Millerand in full view of his possession of the power in question. He would clearly be entitled to exercise it, and no reasonable parliamentary opposition could be maintained on constitu-tional grounds against his doing so. The phrase, &quot;Tl en donne eonnaissanee aux Chambres aussit6t que Tinter&amp;t et la surety de l&apos;Etat le permettent,&quot; appears plainly to contemplate even the negotiation and ratification of a secret treaty, e.g., of alliance with a foreign Power by the President acting alone.
In view of clause 8 above quoted, it would seem quite open to any President of the Republic to act as practically his own Foreign Minister, reporting his proceedings in that capacity from time to time by messages to the Chamber. Such action on his part, if as in the present case his election to the Presidency has been due principally to approval of his foreign policy, would be almost certain to obtain sanction whenever needed from both Chambers. In this way a series of precedents would be established placing the effective control of foreign affairs within the hands of the President of the Republic for the time being.Of course difficulty might arise, and very possibly would arise, in the case of a President who had not been elected on the ground of his successful conduct of foreign affairs. In such a case the Minister who nominally filled the position of Foreign Secretary would be liable to votes of censure of the Chamber or the Senate, or both. If in such circumstances a particular course of foreign policy were disapproved by either or both branches of the Legislature, it would be open to the President under clause 2 of the Constitutional Law already quoted to adjourn the Chambers for a month. This he could do twice in the same session, and such adjournments would give him the opportunity of appealing to public opinion, which might conceivably make itself manifest in so decisive a manner in support of the Presidential foreign policy as would secure that the Chambers would withdraw from their opposition to it. If, however, no such manifestations took place, or if they proved ineffectual, the President, if he could secure the support of the Senate as against the Chamber, appears by article 5 of the Consti-tutional Law of the 25th February, 1875, to possess the power of dissolving the latter body.If the President of the Republic were unable to obtain by one or other means above indicated parliamentary acceptance of his policy, it would appear that it would virtually become necessary for him to resign.On the whole, it appears from the considerations which have been adduced that the present Constitution affords facilities for the personal conduct of foreign policv by the President of the Republic in any case in which he has reason to anticipate that the policy pursued by him will obtain parliamentary support, but that in the absence of such assurance serious deadlocks might be produced. From the national point of view, the exercise by the President of the Republic of the powers which it is clear that he technically possesses would no doubt tend to secure the desired continuity of foreign policy. Probably, therefore, M. Millerand, as President of the Republic, might be content with such a change in the practice of the Constitution as has been under consideration in the present memorandum. It seems probable too that French public opinion would be better satisfied by such a limited change in practice than by embarking on a drastic change in the Constitution in the direction of the American system.September 23, 1920.
