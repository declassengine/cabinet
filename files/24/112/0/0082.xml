g$5s3(P. 7573) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 431.415ft October 1920.(Received 16th, 8 a.m.). Clear the line.   1201 S.   Part II.Following is summary of Tarsi&apos;s letter: &quot; Recall kindness shown to Afghan Delegation at Mussoorie and hope four months&apos; labour will not be in vain. With regard to Amir&apos;s present letter to Viceroy explaining verbal suggestion, made in Mussoorie by Dobbs that certain Indian Moslem should (? be sent) as British Agent to Kabul has not been found acceptable. Amir wishes that personality sent should be Englishman with power to sign treaty subject to ratification. He strongly hopes that early attention -will- be paid to my telegram of 8th August.&quot; This move was. fore-shadowed in para. 29 of Dobbs&apos; report on Mussoorie Conference, and its main object-is probably, as there indicated, to save Afghans amour-propre:Considerations for and against proposal seem to be as follows : (1) Amir&apos;s personality is unknown factor and discussion between him and. British representatives would, whatever its result^ be invaluable in adding to our knowledge of working of present Afghan Government.(2) Agreement made (? with) Amir after personal discussion would have better prospect of permanence than one negotiated by his delegates in India, and it is impossible in present circumstances for Amir to go to India for discussion.(3) It seems very desirable to counteract effects of long stay of Bolshevik Mission in Kabul and of present visit of Jemal Pasha who may otherwise (be) (sic) have very pernicious influence., &quot; .. (4) Since we have accepted Amanulla as Amir and there is no capable substitute in sight, it would be advantageous to show him any support which is possible, and .public recognition implied by sending of delegation would (corrupt group).(5) Discussion in Kabul would probably include men. like Nadir Khan, who would not (?be in) position to intrigue-with native civil servants absent (sic) Afghan , Khoora, as in the case of the Mussoorie Conference.(6) Agreement-would probably more rapidly be concluded at Kabul than in India, ami existence of the despatching wireless apparatus at Kabul would make references to India by British delegates more expeditious than formerly.(7) If Amir&apos;s requests were refused, although he might, ultimately yield and send Afghan Mission to India, there would probably be considerable preliminary period of tension and delay during which trouble might be fostered on frontier and anti-British influence might gain upper hand at Kabul. This, together with developments in internal Indian situation, might indefinitely increase friction and (? postpone) agreement. Present; situation. in East makes early conclusion of the agreement important, and it seems desirable to take advantage of Afghan resentment against Bolsheviks, due,to overthrow of Bokhara, before it has time to cool.-(8) News.of departure of British Delegation for Kabul at Amir&apos;s request and that Amir was seriously considering conclusion of friendly agreement would, for duration of mission: at all events, have very, quieting effect upon whole frontier and among Indian Moslems, and would almost certainly secure peace throughout cold weather. It might also disarm possible Afridi opposition to commencement of Khyber railway.(9) Presence of Afghan delegation at Mussoorie was found very troublesome owing to ineradicable tendency of delegates to intrigues with Indian extremist party. Geographical position of Mussoorie made it possible to. isolate delegates to some extent, but this would be difficult if renewed discussions took place in cold weather in plains. We should therefore, in. present circumstances, strongly deprecate arrival at India of another Afghan delegation,: and only alternative is despatch of British Mission to Kabul..   ,Considerations against proposal;* (1) British consent to send Mission might to some extent be interpreted as undue eagerness to secure Afghan friendship. But precedents are in favour of despatch of British Mission to Kabul shortly after accession of new Amir, and we could emphasise fact that Mission went at, Amir&apos;s special request and initiative. Fact that Amir had sent two missions to India before British Mission: went to Kabul would also prevent any loss of dignity.(2) British Mission might be placed in apparent position of competing for Amir&apos;s&apos; favour with Bolshevik Mission and Jemal Pasha and of bidding against-them.   Also
if less honourable reception and treatment were granted to British Mission than to two others mentioned situation would be awkward. But this, danger oi&apos; apparent competition for AimYs&apos; favour is, as mentioned in former telegrams, inherent in present circumstances and would in fact exist, though perhaps less obviously, if Afghan delegation had again visited India, it is most (? irn)probable that AmirWould on any occasion wish to meet British and Bolshevik Missions simultaneously. If he did so British (? would probably) have to refuse.to attend. Anxiety of Afghanistan to take her place amongst civilised nations and traditions of Kabul hospitality make any deliberate discourtesy&apos;unlikely. &apos; -----(3) Amir&apos;s tenure of power seems none too secure, and he might possibly be assassinated or dispossessed while&apos;British Mission was in Kabul with results dangerous to safety of British representatives. Moreover, efforts of bitterly anti-British Missions in Kabul, anxious to commit Afghanistan against British, might inflame fanatical sections of the populace against British representatives (? and) place them in danger. We do not regard this as a very serious probability. After weighing foregoing arguments we consider that the balance is decidedly in favour of acceptance of the Arnir&apos;s invitation in view of-the paramount importance of detaching Afghanistan early from hostile combinations. This opinion is, however, subject to following conditions:  &apos;--...... (i) Unless British Mission were authorised from commencement to address Amirofficially as His Majesty their position in Kabul would be impossible with Bolshevik, Turkish and possibly Persian Missions on spot conceding that title to him. &apos;    v.(ii) Two of our officers, namely, Naib Tahsildar of Zhob, and Scriven, Assistant Engineer, who were (? kidnapped by) raiders, are still (? detained in) Kandahar, in spite of. Tarsfs promise to make enquiries about&apos; them. We have few days ago addressed another strong letter to Tarsi on the subject. Kidnapping of first officer was mentioned in proceedings of the &apos; 16th meeting of Mussoorie Conference, dated 2,2nd July 1920, and of second in our telegram, to you, 002 F., 1st September 1920. Both are being well treated, but delay in their release shows deplorable attitude on part of AimYs officials. If these officers are not released before our reply on present proposals goes to Amir, we would inform him British-delegation cannot start until they are set free. &apos; ; - - !(4) We read AnuYs letter as containing definite acceptable (sic) of main princi-ples and stipulations contained in Mussoorie (corrupt group), printed in consent to proposed delegation emphasising in our reply that we understood lie accepts them and that despatch of British delegation is based on that understanding.(5) It seems extremely probable that we shall be forced to undertake operations against Wano Wazirs. If so, Amir might, after arrival of British delegation at Kabul, repeat manoeuvres attempted at Mussoorie Conference and demand suspension of operations during discussions. Accordingly (? if) proposal of despatch of British delegation is accepted, we think it essential to tell Amir plainly, in Conveying our provisional acceptance, that Wano operations are contemplated in the event of Wazirs not accepting our terms, and that we wish him to understand that our delegates will not be authorised to entertain any suggestion for suspension of operations during discussion at Kabul. &apos;&apos;!&apos;&apos;   . -:     &apos;       .    &apos;&quot;((&apos;)) If despatch of Mission were approved, we- should have probably to stipulate that British wireless operator: should be allowed to accompany it and to despatch its messages on Kabul wireless, otherwise Russian operator might purposely mutilate messages and render rapid communication with India impossible. .(7) We could not probably comply with the request of Amir to keep total number of Mission, including followers, down to 20 ; but this is a minor matter.&quot;We *tr&apos;nst that you will let us have a very early order oil these proposals. If early despatch of Mission is generally approved, ;we- will, telegraph again&apos;regarding details of negotiations. &apos;\ ;   -.. ,: - , -
