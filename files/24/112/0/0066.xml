(this wmm^m the phqpekty tut ris bhitam-jic muebiyis gov^hott).Mote by the Minister of labour on the classes of es-Service mn In the London area receiving Out-of-^ork Donation at15th September. 1920.SECRET 1966,With reference to Cabinet 43 (20)0onolusion 4 (b), I attach    for the information of my colleagues a memorandum on the classes of ex-Servioe men in the London area who were in receipt of-Out-of-Work Donation at 15th September. 1930.The memorandum reveals very dearly in respect of the London men (and I have no reason to suppose this is not equally true elsewhere) the following facts(a) The men are generally representative of the Services, and cannot in any way be regarded as a class \vhiohk owing to the comparatively privileged nature of the war service rendered, has no especial claim on the community;   thus about half had at least 8 years service abroad and more than three quarters served abroad at one time or another.(b) A very large proportion of them are unskilled.(c) a considerable proportion are comparatively young: 58,3$ below the age of S5:   60.5$ below/ 20.(Sgd)   t. j.

At the date of the enquiry about 65,000 ex-Service men ana women in the london area were in receipt of Out-of-vVoii: Donation, and complete returns have been received and. tabulated in respect of 38,036 of this total, covering 0,773 disabled and &apos; 291854 non-disabled.   An analysis of the branches of Service in which these persons were employed during the V.ar discloses the following results20,294 were in Infantry.4,942 11 &quot; Departmental Corps.3.,776 &quot; &quot; Artillery.2,036 &quot; * tfavy.1,918 &quot; &quot; labour Corns.1,791 &quot; Air tforce.1,522 &quot; &quot; ftoyal Engineers.&apos;0?he rest were distributed aaaong the Cavalry, Machine Gun and Sank Corps, other Army Corps, Merchant Seamen and women&apos;s Corps,     It will be seen that the Infantry covers 53.4 per cent, inirther, the Infantry were 51 per cent of the non-disabled and 61 per cent of the disabled.

A certain amount of caution should be observed however, in considering these figures, partly because they reveal an unexpected amount of continuous employment and partly because the lapse of time since the period to which the figures relate was bound to lead to inaocurate statements being made by ex-Service men concerned. Sfhis is the more noticeable as the Trade Unions percentage unemployed in August 1914 rose to cover 7 per cent.   It issurprising for ^Rtc^ce., that in the transport trades and among general labourers, both of which are particularly liable to broken spells of employment, such a high proportion of con-tinuous employment should be shown.POST-WAR DJ TiUBUTKhl BY INDUSTRY.In the following Table the 38026 persons are analysed according to the principal industries under which they have been classified at the Employment Exchanges.

The largest group-conveyance of men. goods, messages,etc. consists almost entirely of unskilled workers, and the figures for the building and engineering industries also, relate very largely to unskilled workers, while in addition over 9,000 are classified as general labourers.   The figures have not so far been analysed by occupations but it is estimated that at least 25,000 of the total of 38,000 odd are unskilled.DISTRIBUTION BY AGB GROUPS.
