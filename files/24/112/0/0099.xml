Work necessary to preserve the mines is still being done, though there are indications that if no settlement be reached in ten days&apos; time this labour may be with-drawn in some areas.   The men are solid and, at present, good humoured.   The disorder at Tonypandy was caused by a small and irresponsible revolutionary element.A Lancashire miner of thirty years1 experience has suggested a compromise on the following lines: that the demands be concede! to those miners who work five shifts a week; he thinks that this would improve output and that the Federation could not very well refuse.   The miners&apos; officials and trade union leaders are anxious for a settlement, but only on the concession of the 2s. inorease.The railway delegates will probably carry a strike resolution this week, but this does not mean that they really represent the railwaymen, for the delegates1 meetings have been sparsely attended and the extremists have had it all their own way.   Even if the men are called out, a considerable body, amounting on one line to 40$ of the drivers, will refuse to obey.The road transport workers, numbering 150,000, have decided to strike on Saturday failing a Settlement of their claims, but there are indications this morning that an agreement may be reached.There/
-   *-There ia a feeling, assiduously fanned by the revolutionary press, that the Government and the employers are leagued together to attack trade unionism.   This is a serious factor.Unemployment cornea next in importance to the coal strike.   As an example of misrepresentation, John Hill writes in the Boilermakers1 Journal, &quot;Our employers have dellberatoly brought about (unemployment) with malice aforrfchought,..Our industry is run for profit..,and profit only.  The first thing essential to this end is to have a surplus of labour.HThe Whitehall disturbances were the work of an organised gang.The circulation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has fallen by at least 25 per centt*&apos; Miss Sylvia Pankhurst has been arrested and two Communist speakers in Birmingham have been bound over for inciting to disorder,.
COAL STRIKE - . ..  .Foaling in tho coalfields shows wido divergence, varying from entire confidence in the success of tho strike and of a consequent revolution, to keen regret that a strike * has boon called.   The one outstanding point is that the men are, at present, absolutely solid; they are not yet short of money and are in good humour, hut it is clear that if the strike continues, possibly beyond  norb week, this feeling will change.One case of disorder has occurred at&apos;Tonypandy, which will doubtless be a storm centre.The order to allow enough men to work to prevnnt damage to the pits has been obeyed, except in tv/o Durham collieries. There is, however, considerable support in South Wales for the proposal that all labour shall bo withdrawn if the strike bo not settled by October 30th.Although many branches of the National Union of railway&amp;ymon have instructed their delegates to support sympathetic strike action, the lodge meetings, which are generally attended only by extremists, do not represent the feeling of tho majority,&apos; which is opposed to strike action.On October 18th at a secret meeting between delegates of the Irish Trades Union Congress and English Labour leaders, Mr, Robertson, II.?., said that if the strike were not settled in tv/o weeks he thought it would last seven or eight.   Mr, Adamson advised that tho railway men and transport workers should to all outward appearance, keep away from the miners, in order to mislead the Government as to w::iat assistance they wero actually giving.   Efr. Hodges expressed the same view regarding secrecy, but said .that moral support should bo given, unasked,.to the miners.   Another speaker reminded tho meeting that tho miners did not support the railwaymen last year.Considerable/
Considerable antagonism to tho Government was manifest throughou^ the meeting.It is important to noto that tho railwayiuen have grievances of thoir own and, in common with many workers, believe that tho Government and tho employers arc trying to break up trade unionism.   This belief carries very great weight, because the working classes have been taught to regard collective bargaining as their only safeguard against exploitation.There is no great enthusiasm for sympathetic action among transport workers, but it seems certain that the road men will come out on Saturday, unless their own claims are previously settled.The attitude of the public is one of firm support for the Government, but there is a decided tendency towards a wholesale condemnation of labour which may create bad feeling.   The general opinion is that any weakening or compromise on.the part of the Government would have a fatal effect on national prosperity. Manufacturers maintain that the uncertainty of labour conditions makes it impossible to give fixed prices fbr contracts.The effect of the strike on industry is already considerable and enforced idleness gives the workers tho opportunity to listen to extremist speakers, who are making the most of thoir chances and working hard to provoke a national general strike. South wales south Wales appears to be quite solid; at present pumpers, stokers, winding enginemen, banksmen, and hitchers are working, the last two on condition that they do not handle coal, but on October  2nd a conference of federation delegates will consider a&apos; proposal that if the strike be not settled by October 30th, a national conference of the Minors&apos; Federation of Great Britain shal consider tho withdrawal of all the men from every colliery inGroat/        I
Great Britain.   Opinion in *South Wales undoubtedly favours this course.   On the other hand, members of the colliery Fireman, Examiners and Deputies Association, appear determined to prevent the flooding of the mines, should this threat become operative.On  October 18th a disorderly mob, consisting of irresponsible youths and a few extremists, caused a disturbance in Pandy Square, Tonypandy.   The police intervened and stones wore thrown &quot;but little material damage was done,   fciy of the crowd went to the assistance of the police and responsible miners and local official^&apos;have urged the men to refrain from riotous conduct.The majority of the ex-Service men in this district are so strongly opposed to tho miners that friction between the two bodies is not impossible..The following branch meetings of the National Union of Railwayman and the Associated Society of Locomotive Enginemon and firemen decided to support direct aotion if necessary: Barry, Pontypridd, Pontnewyidd, Mywain, Tonypandy, Quakers Yard, Aberojoaon, Tonda and Cardiff So. 1.   BJt^gend was practically unanimous against stride action.   These meetings were not representative, only 63 men being present at the Cardiff meeting from a membership of about 1,000.   Most of the men are indifferent..The membership of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation is  10,000 and their total funds  412,484, Is. Id., of which  175,711. 19s. 2d. is invested in the Co-operative Wholesale Bank.   The membership of the various districts in 1919 was as follows j-Aberdare 10.016Afan Valley 6,307Anthracite 15,245Blaina 4,037Dowlais 3,139 astern Valley (Mon.) 8,972East Glamorgan 7,318Bbbw/

They are, however, still reasonable and owing to an exceptionally heavy fall of dirt in an air way of the Crombrook pit, local permits for six days have been given, to allow men to remove the dirt.     Some of the men say that the least they would accept as a settlement is an unconditional advance of l/6d.Strike pay will be at the rate of  1 per week and 2/-per child (not working).    The men have been told that their funds will cover strike pay for three or four weeks.The membership of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners1 Federation&quot;is about 91,000.There appears to be no desire on the part of local railwaymen for a strike; Manchester, Liverpool and Preston branches of the National Union of Railwaymen have decided to leave the question in &quot;the hands of the   Executive Gommittee.    The action of the transport workers is said to depend lioon the decision of the railwaymen.There is nervousness in this area lest the railwaymen&apos; guaranteed week bo suspended under a clause relating to labour unrest, which is stated to have been already applied to brakesmen at Wigan.    The men are saying that if theyare/
are only to work about two days a week, they may as wellstrike.yprkshiro.The strike order was unexpected in this coalfield, where the men had made up their minds that a compromise would be reaohod.    The great majority is quiet and seems to bo waiting on events.    The Yorkshire Miners1 Association is said to have funds sufficient for only two weeks strike pay.The Associated Society of Locomotive Enginemon and Firemen,   ied by J. Bromley, has been in session at Leeds and my correspondent thinks that an opportunity to repeat the tactics of the railway strike is being awaited.On October 17th speakers of the Economic Study Club, who attempted to put the Government&apos;s oase, were shouted down by an audience of 1,500 at Leeds. NorthumberlandThe Executive Council of the Northumberland Miners&apos; Federation has decided that full members shall receive strike pay, at the rate of 5/- per day, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays.    Men living in rented houses will receive 5/- extra and an allowance will be made of 2/-per week for each child under 16 years, who is not working Only such repair work as is essential to keep the pits open will be allowed.The men are ouiet and are likely to remain so as long as their strike pay lasts.Railwaymen at Gateshead, Tyne Dock, Blyth, Slaydon and some smaller local branches have instructed their delegates to support the miners, but to follow any recommendation of the Executive.   Feeling is, however, by no means unanimously in favour of supporting the miners.The membership of the Federation is about 39,000 fulland/
and 4,000 half members and the funds are about  80,000. Durham gIt has been decided that at Pelton Fell and Silkswo i pits no members of the Federation shall work; in the laJj oase the manager1e request for eleven horse-keepers, one! pumpman, two firemen and four fitters was refused,        1The membership of the Durham Miners&apos; Association inH July, 19HO, was 127,250 full members and 22,940 half men! The balance on last year!s workings was  85,293. 18s. 2di and the investments amounted to  483,463, INottinghamshire IThe men here are still good-tempered, though deterail they seem to think they will gain tneir demands in two oil three weeks. Feeling between the colliery officials and 1 the strikers is good; the latter blame the Government for]the strike. IThe men base great hopes on action by the Triple    IAlliance and do not think they can bring the strike to 8 Isuccessful issue alone.The membership of the Nottinghamshire Miners&apos;Association in April, 1920, waB 38,500; their funds amountnearly  300,000.WarwickshireThe Warwickshire Miners&apos; Council has decided to pay strike pay of  1 per week, with Is. extra for each child under 14,   Feeling in the coalfield is divided, especially in the Wuneaton district; the older men, who say that industries are &quot;no good to them&quot; favour compromise...The membership of the Warwickshire Miners&apos; Association is about 18,000 and the funds amount to about  30,000. , LeicestershireMy correspondent states that the solidarity of the men, who did not believe a strike to be the only alternateto/I
534to rejection of the datum line, is impressive.   They are practically solid in favour of an impartial tribunal.   They say that they will hold out as Ion? as they can get food, &quot;but seem to he relying on the railwaymen and other trade unionists to assist them to victory.The membership of the Leicestershire Miners1 Association was 8,340 in August, 1920, and their fluids on the same date were  48,384,, Cannock ChaseThe holiday spirit is already waning in this area and many of the men are seeking employment in the rural districts; some are engaged on potato digging.The funds amount to about  40,000 and are expected to last about five weeks.The approximate membership and funds of other Midlandorganisations are said to be as followsMembership^ FundsDerbyshire 57,000 &apos;  449,406North Staffordshire 23,000    , -      79,520South Staffordshire 4,500  13,000Most of the railwaymen in the Midland districts are opposedto striking in sympathy with the miners.Somerset    &apos;The accumulated funds of the Somerset Miners1 Association amounted in December 1919 to  18,341. 3s. 11-Jd., and have probably increased since that date. SCO TLAN33 :    !There has, as yet, been no disorder in the Scottish coal-fields, but Mr. Joseph Sullivan, of the Lanarkshire Miners1 Union, stated on October 16th that the miners would take over the mines - in less than a month, with or without the sanction of their Trade Union leaders, if the strike lasts so long. LanarkshireStrike pay iS to be at the rate of 8s,. per week and Is. 6d. for eaoh child, plus 12s. per week end Is. for eaoh child,from/
from the National.Union of Scottish Mincworkers, to which thecounty union is affiliated.The membership (men and boys) is about 60,000 and the funds amount to about  87,000.The Executive of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos;, County Unionhas sent to the Scottish Labour College a formal protest against the campaign of McLean and McDougall in Lanarkshire,which &quot;is mainly directed against our union   and has for its...... t.object the oreation of dissension and disruption in ourranks.&quot;TEE POSSIBILITY OF A RAILWAY AND TRANSPORT strike the Executive of the Railwaymen will meet again to-day, but it is thought tha* they will reach no decision before : - Friday.If the London, Brighton and South Coa*rt Railway is a fair criterion of the others, it is almost certain that a railway strike would fail. The locomotive engineer has been round the locomotive shops and finds that 40$ of the drivers will notoome out.   They say that they do notoare what they are called, &quot;but they will not obey their Executive.   In the event of a strike, this line can be kept running with a restricted service.   The clerical staff of the Read Offioe have all been trained as signalmen and with these and 40$ of the drivers andl the other men that will be left, together with outside help, j a service can be run.   In fact, the General Manager would prefer to have a strike now than later on.The Road Transport Workers.have decided to back the mineri and fight also for their own demands, and they will probably come out this.week. THE DISORDERS IN WHITES AIL-On October 18th some 20,000 of the London unemployed took part in the procession to Whitehall.   While they wereawaiting/
awaiting tho return of the Mayors from Doming Street, a gang of organised roughs in Whitehall stoned the police and a charge was necessary.   A section of the rioters shut themselves up in Richmond Gardens, hut were dislodged.   A stone coping and windows were broken in Whitehall and a jewellers shop waslooted in the Strand.   Q^enty-nine policemen were injured by stone throwing.Of the nine rioters arrested, only one appears to have been an ex-Service man and it is doubtful whether he took part in the demonstration.   Four were under twenty years of age.It was noticed that a number of mil dressed persons, all wearing identical cloth caps, were egging on the roughs. Members of the International Union of Ex-Service Men at Shepherd1s Bash were recognised among them, as was Steele of the Hyde Park Communist Group,   ^hey did not tc-^ke part in the procession but assembled opposite the end of Downing Street where two speakers were urging the crowd to rush the police. Many of the older men at the back of the crowd denounced the rioting., and some of them considered that it had been organised by the police and started by paid agents *It has been alleged that the plan was for Mr. Lansbury to emerge from Downing Street during the riot and quell it, in order that he might be rehabilitated in the public eye.   He did come/but with this purpose but he was at once engulfed by the crowd and nearly swept off his feet.   Spectacular histrionics of this kind would be quite in accordance with Mr, Lansburyrs inclinations   and with his past record, but there is as yet no proof that he knew what was going to happen.   He made a very violent attack on the police in the &quot;Herald&quot; the following day; it was so unfair that it- can have convinced no one.A remarkable point about the riot was the terror excited by the mounted police when they began to move.QBE/
The tocutive of tho Communist Party of ft r eat Britain has announced its willingness to comply with the demand of the Third International for the organisation of one Communist Party in Great Britain,The Communist Labour Party, while agreeing that unity is much to &quot;be desired, advises the English parties to proceed with the amalgamation,and they will follow the same course in Scotia: Sylvia Pankhurefs group states that it &quot;desires unity at, all costs, but not at the price of sacrificing its aa ti-parliamentary: principles.&quot;It is interesting to note that the functions of the Communist Labour Party are officially stated to be: &quot;to set about getting finance also concentrate on communist unity,&quot; Members&apos; subscriptions are to be 2s, per month, 50;&apos;* going to headquarters.While the unification of the various groups appears to mak little progress it is significant that in the Midlands the leaders are addressing kindred organisations, and it is not unlikely that in the event of a crisis they would pool their resources and funds in order to overthrow the existing order.On October 17th Shepperson and Stewart, the communists who have recently made inflammatory speeches at Birmingham, wei arrested on charges of inciting to disturbance.   They were bound over, in their own recognisances of  10, to keep the peace for six months, and undertook not to repeat their offences. The warrants were issued, in default of more recent legislation under the Statute of 53dward the Third, which defending counsel described as &quot;a bit dusty and mouldy,&quot;Communist speakers are still advooating the seizure of 1)h means of production and theft, as is proved by the followinginstanoes/TOE C0MHI3I gjgglg
instances:R.u Y., Harvey, Birmingham. Oct. ,13th&quot;You can rid yourselves of all unemployment whenever you care to say.   It&apos;s up to you workers to &quot;break out and revolt against this stinking, dirty capitalist system ... Are you afraid of the authorities because if you are,we are not. We of the Communist Party are&apos;out to overthrow the authorities both locally and nationally.&quot; H. Shejyserson at the same meeting&quot;Vie will say to the authorities &apos;We want boots and we want the;:, at once.   We want bread and we want that at onoeT and if the authorities refuse to set us what we want then we shall tell them we are going to take them ourselves... 3)onTt be afraid of the damned authorities, we communists are not afraid... We don&apos;t want you to loot the sMps, we want you to take all that is stocked up in the factories.&quot; A. Ward, Wi/ran. Oct. 17th&quot;You know where the food is and if you take my advice you will go and get it and get the unemployed people to help jtou ... If you are starvinc: you will not be too particular about the methods you employ, when you know it is in the country ... The miners are fools for making arrangements to save the property of the colliery owners from ruin whilst the owners are starving them.&quot;George Deacon. Anihurst Road, pot.) 17th said that in a few weeks the railwayman would be on strike and that the miners should have waited and set up a soviet*   This was bound to come and would probably be in the form of a revolution.   Ho one need be afraid, a little blood would be spilled, but tit would be to the entire benefit of the workers.?jawdy3 at a Lend on meeting of -the^Ooamimiat Party (British Section of the Third International) on October 16th. said thatthe/
the masters were determined to starve the workers into submission, so the workers must see to it that they control the food and starve them.   It is no good for the workers to&apos; go to Parliament for better houses, clothes and food, they have the power in their own hands and must use it in the factories and workshops.   They must take over and control the means of production to alter the present system of sooi ety.RDTSSIAH MCHgg i?0B BBITISH HBVOLUTIORAKCBS   ,It is stated that Lenin has nothing to, do with the , distribution of money to parties abroad, but that this is a function of Zinovieff.   The British delegates who went to Moscpw made their demands, for, funds in writing and it is alleged that Quelch and McLaine of the Communist Party of Great Britain asked for- 100,000 per annum; this was refused and they, put in an application for a much smaller amount, possibly  10,000, which was granted..Murphy-, Ramsay and Gallacher are reported to have made an application on behalf of the Workers1 Committees, which was granted.   Clarke, editor.of the &quot;Worker&quot;, who made an , , independent application, is stated to have been refused, Mrs. Walter Newbold asked for money on behalf of the Communis section of the Independent Labour Party and of the Bational Young Labour Leagae, but it is not yet known if her request was grafted.   Ha-rUpine and Connolly are reported to have obtains&apos;! tt-jwrxbr^n ^r/tonige from ainovieff of  2,000 yearly. It is father ropjr^ei that Sylvia Pankhurst was promised  1,000 y^vny, la part dependent upon her efforts to bring about tho un^ifv*ti:on of the Communist groups.   If after the conference her party merges with the Communist Party of Great Britain, she is to receive some of the money allocated to t party;   if, through no fault of her own, unity is not achieve she will receive independent assistance.   It is believed thatInkpin/
537Inkpin has already received part of the money promised to his party.In a recent article on the breakdown of diplomaticnegotiations between Britain and Russia, Radek wrote:&quot;We know that the Red Army represents only one of our weapons, and that our second weapon is the propaganda of Communism which is forming great armies in the rear of our enemies.   Capitalist England has torn to pieces our ,July treaty for mutual rejection of propaganda. We are little afraid of the Entente-English agitation. But on the other hand, the British Government is very much afraid of our agitation.   It is afraid of our influence in the East, and we say to this Government: Gentlemen, you strove to defeat, to crush the voice of Soviet Russia in London, but you shall hear this voice not only in London, but also from millions of the workers of the East&apos;&quot;.PROPOSED REVOLUTIONARY ACTION IN COVENTRYIt is reported, on the authority of a single correspondent, that Coventry extremists are making plans to seiae the Drill Hall and various publio buildings at a given moment.   The Irish and ex-Service elements to the number of about 1,000 appear to have joined forces and their object is to seize the rifles at present in the Drill Hall.   It is stated that a similar movement is contemplated in Glasgow.COUNCILS Off ACTIONIn spite of the &quot;Daily Herald* s&quot; prediction of &quot;monster meetings&quot; on October 17th the Council of Action gatherings in the London area were much smaller than was the case in August. The speakers dealt with unemployment and the miners&apos; strike rather than with Russia, but resolutions were passed demanding immediate peace with Russia and the resumption of trade relations with a view to relieving unemployment.About 1,000 people attended the meeting held under the auspices of the Woolwich Counoil of Action at Plumstead Baths,which/
which was addressed by Mr. Bevin and Mrs. Despard,   The former,who received an ovation, stated that in his opinion the coal   ^strike had been deliberately engineered by the Government inorder to crush trade unionism.   A feature of his speech, as ofmeny others, was advertisement of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.The national Counoil, which is probably nonplussed bythe waning interest in Russian matters, has issued a manifestoin which it declares that:Peace with Russia would mean for British Workers cheaper food.   That is why British Profiteers want war.The leaflet then attempts to show that the cost of wheat, eggs and butter is influenced by relations between Britain and Russiaand that;Peace and Trade with Russia will mean More food, Lower Prioes, More employment.The reverse side of the leaflet deals with unemployment aniemphasises Russia^ need for goods of various kinds; finally iturges that:The way to prevent unemployment is to make Peace with Russia.The Rhondda and Merthyr Councils of Action have assumed&quot;-full control of all the local.trade unions and intend to utilise the organisations for revolutionary purposes when themoment is considered opportune.   The ringleaders are floah Ablet^one of the most powerful extremists in South Wales, S.O. Daviesand A. P. Yates,. editor of the Merthyr &quot;Pioneer&quot;.FEELING AMONG EX-SERVICS UBjgReports received indicate that although most of the members! of the National Union of Bx-Service Men and the International Union of fix-Service Men are revolutionary, the NationalFederation/
S3 8Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers and the &quot;Comrades of the Great War&quot; are, in the n.*ain, loyal and prepared to support the Government in the case of necessity. The first named bodies consist largely of conscripts, while the members of the others sre men who volunteered in the earlier stages of the war.   There seems little doubt that if these men can be convinced that the Government is trying to provide employment for them, they will cease to give cause for anxiety.In Bristol, under the leadership of Gilmore, the International Union of   -Service Men has been ocoupled with the cases of ejection.   Two men were arrested for disorderly conduct in this connection but were subsequently discharged.   The main feature of the meetings in this area is violent abuse of the police to whom the epithet &quot;vermin&quot; and even more objectionable terms are applied.The Glasgow branch of the International Union of, Ex-Service Men recently chartered-a steamer for a trip on the Clyde with the object of raising money; the Executive found, however, that the&apos;venture had merely increased their dobts and the affair has consequently been hushed up.TEE BUILDERS and DILUTIONThe proposal to employ ex-Service men to build houses is provoking the strongest opposition among the rank and file of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Sooiety.   They are urging their Executive to use any moans for stopping it.THE DOCKERSOn tho 19th Mr0 Ernest Bevin laid his scheme for the payment of the dockers before a meeting presided over by Major Attlee, Mayor of Stepney.   On the whole, it was well received.Robert/
Robert Williams took the opportunity of making a revolutionary speooh and Mr. Lansbury of attacking the Government.   2.500 people were present.   Having carried his resolution, Mr. Bevi/j called for the singing of the &quot;Red Flag&quot;.*THE FELLOWSHIP 01? R:lC0^CILIL?l0NThis Fellowship is holding a week1e Mission in Hyde Park. Their speakers urfce the scrapping of tho Army, Navy und Air Force and independence for Ireland,   i/iien one of them put a resolution demanding the releaae of HacSwiney the crowd beoame hostile.THE SCOTTISH LABOUR. COLLEGE&apos; There are few more active propaganda organisations in the Kingdom than the Scottish Labour College and it is therefore of interest to note that its income to date is  1147. 4s. 10^-d. and the expenditure  1064. 12s. 9d., leaving a balance of  82. 12s. 1-J-dc which is only sufficient to meet liabilities which fall due on Uovaujaor 1st.THE &quot;DAILY. HERALD&quot;Messrs. Vt\ H. Smith    Sons, who distribute most of the copies of tho &quot;Daily Horrid&quot;, cay that since the price was increased to 2d. the circulation has dropped 35$ to 4C$. Enquiries made in the  acv, South-Wast arid South-Eastern districts of London show that the sales have greatly decreased, On whe other hand, working men who were in the habit of buying two or three papers a day are now limiting their purchase to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   In the London area it is clear that the s has decreased by q;iite 25$.   The &quot;Herald&quot; is still buying its paper at 6d. a pound, though there has been a reduction in tho cost of paper.   Messrs. F. R. 3*ith &apos;.&apos; Sons think that its financial/
^ financial position is precarious.  .In Coventry the sales have fallen from 945 to 756 daily; in Leicestershire (avercge-daily sale 8,500) and in Nottingham-shire (average daily sale 16,000) the decrease is about 20$.i   sales have also decreased in Birmingham, and in S*uth Wales, where the &quot;Daily News&quot; is regaining part of its lost ground.The Trade Union leaders associated with the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; are doing their best.   Mr. J. Bromley has addressed an apppeal . to the members of the locomotive drivers, asking, them to remember that &quot;if the 1 Daily Herald&apos; goes down our cause goes down tee.!   You must repel the attacks of our enemies by pushing the &apos;Daily Herald&apos;&quot;.The &quot;Herald&quot; has adopted the plan - remarkable in view of its constant appeals for funds - of sending registered , letters to branches of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers containing  15 in Treasury Notes and the words, &quot;Be good enough to insert notice of receipt j   in the rDaily Herald&apos;&quot;. - One such contribution was returned by j   the Liverpool branch and the covering letter has come into my hands.   The object, of course, is to pose as the friend of discharged soldiers.On October 17th Mr.&apos; Maione informed the East Leyton branch of the Communist Party of Oreat Britain that he had received a letter from the East Leyton Parliamentary Committee asking him to resign his soat.   He added that he did not intend to. do..so, . as in his election pledge he had stated that he would support the Coalition as far us was consistent, with &quot;his principles, but that having become disgusted with the Coalition he had gone over to the&apos; Communist Party as the only: movement likely to benefit the workers.

The recogni-ticn of the Irish Republio and the part to be taken by English labour in its formation were discussed, Johnson stating that the Irish looked to the English workers for assistance.   The Irish &quot;delegates were anxious to be assured that the Scarborough resclutions were sincere.   Mr. Lansbury declared that Labour members should do their utmost to &quot;scotch&quot; the Home Rule Bill, tho &quot;worst ever put forward&quot; when it came before the House.On October 14th it was stated at a branch meeting of the Irish Self-Determination League in Chandos Hall, that all arrangements had been made to oomplete the funeral of the Lord Mayor of Cork within 24 hours of his death.   The names and addresses of 10 men in each branch, who were willing to act as stewards, were to be taken, and they would be informed of his death by telegram.During the week Sinn Fein meetings have been held in various parts of the country, but nothing of importance occurred.   On October 17th Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington spoke at Coventry, making&amp;gthe/
-    540the usual accusations against tho Royal Irish Constabulary.A considerable Influx of young   Sinn Feiners is reported from the South Wales coalfield.   In the West of Scotland, whero they are prominently associated with tho Red Guard, Sinn Peiners are openly elated at the ooal strike and boast that the volunteers are strong enough to take and hold Glasgow.It is reported that the volunteers in Glasgow and in the West of Scotland number 20,000 and that 20,000 have revolvers and 2,000 rifles,   They are stated to have plans of Maryhill Barracks, Hamilton Bcrracks and of the Drill Halls in Glasgow.IRELAND ^ &apos;216 outrages, 16 more than during the preceding week, wore reported; of these 168 wore directly attributable to Sinn Fein, 4 were due to agrarian motives and the remaining 44 which included 3 cases of murder were serious miscellaneous crimes.    Six members of the Force were murdered during the woek, and there were several cases in which parties of police on patrol were fired upon but escaped sericus injury.   One constable, one Resident Magistrate, one Justice of the Peace, and six other civilians were kidnapped by the Irish Republican Army. iSoven vacated Police barracks were destroyed during the week and there were many other cases of malicious injury to property.   The mail was held up and robbed over 50 times. The actual number of raids for arms and of cases of intimidation by Sinn Fein is unknown but 17 instances were reported.   A correspondent states that on October 4th, a typed circular was issued from the Headquarters of the Irish Republican Army in Dublin to all county Commandants directing them to speed up attacks on police and military between that date and the openingof/
of Parliament, in order, presumably, to show the irreconcilable nature of the Irish demands..&apos;On the evening of tho 14th October a military search   i party in Dublin was fired upon whilst searching the &quot;Republican Bar&quot; in Talbot Street.   They returned the- fire and some prominent Sinn Foinors wero killed, amongst them being an unknown  man and a man believed to be John Treacey, vice-commandant of the Tipperary Brigade, Irish Republican Army.Information from another source, the credibility of whic is unknown, is to the effect that Dr. McCartan is in Dublin, that a meeting of Sinn Fein leaders was held and McCartan was instructed to return to America and inform de V&amp;n&apos;installera that Michael Collins will be appointed President of the Irish Republic and that he (de Valera) can remain at Washington as ambassador.The reports of reprisals are creating a great deal of al and papers seized at a raid in Dublin show how seriously they are affecting the Irish Republican Army &quot;into the ranks of which fear and cowardice are creeping.&quot;The railway impasse continues; railway facilities are greatly curtailed everywhere and are almost non-existent in the West.   The &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; contemplates a &quot;general close down of the railways by the Government as a consequenc of the successful four months struggle.&quot;
