Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.I desire to bring before the Cabinet an aspect of Sinn Pein activity in the V.reat of Scotland which calls for attention, and for a decision as to the policy to be pursued^    The facts, and the question on which a decision is necessary, are set forth in a memor-andura which I have received from the Lord Advocate, and a copy of which Is attached heretaI do not know whether a similar situation exists In any part of England, but possibly it does (or nay arise) in centres where there is a considerable Irish element.    Any action to be taken by the Authorities in Scotland mi $it therefore have to he considered in the li;:.ht of its effects in England, and, of course, with due regard to its bearing on the situation in- Ireland. It is for these reasons mainly that I have thought it necessary to lay the matter before the Cabinet.(Sgd)   ROBERT MUNRO.Scottish Office,18th October, 1920*
.m Memorandum by the Lord Advocate to thojU Secretary for Scotland.ILLEGAL DRILLING.On 17th September last I received complaints of illegal drilling in and around Lanarkshire.I had the natter at once investigated and I append &apos;t a copy of the Procurator Fiscalrs Report,U^ulxrtcd. On the 13th October   I received Information fromthe Scottish Command as to tho enrolment of ex-service men In Sinn Fein organisations for the purpose of drilling.I understand that legal evidence can be obtained to prove these drillings and enrolments.I have no doubt they are indictable offences of a grave character*Tho Solicitor General and I have carefully consider-ed the situation and we have had the advantage of discus S3 rig the general situation with General Sir F, Davies, G.O.C. in Scotland.There are, I understand, some few thousand Sinn Feiners in and around Lanarkshire and before any action is taken to bring the offenders to Justice I desire to haveguidance on the question of policy which in? raised and should bo Glasgow^d of some assurance that there is sufficient force in Lanarkshire to cope with any trouble which may arise as a result, of arrests being made and prosecutions being started.It should be pointed out that the Sinn Fein illegal drillings have not s^ far involved any active breach of the peace.    On the other hand I have been informed un-officdaily that the Orangemen in Lanarkshire (who must number some thousands) are drilling also.These drillings have./ I believe, been going on for some months, but no ^active stops have yet been taken to prevent or prohibit them.     Present unemployment tends to en-cenrage drillingsThere are at least two possible courses which might be taken, viz;-(i) to prohibit the meetings in a prescribed area or areas under Article 9 (E) of the Defence of the   Realm Regulations and thereafter to treat any subsequent meetings as offences against these Regulations, or(2) to indict the offenders in the High Court under 60 Geo. Ill and I Geo. IV cap, I.     That is a British Statmte which declares that meetings for training to the use of arms or in military exercises without the authority of the Sovereign, the Lord Lieutenant, or two Justices of the Peace are -  &apos; illegal-both as regards the instructor and those instructed. The punishment on conviction may be penal servitude for the instructor and fine and imprisonment (up to 2 years) for those attending the meeting.After careful consideration, and if it is deter-minod as a matter of policy that these drilling are to be prohibited, I suggest that proceedings should be- instituted not under Article&apos;9 (E) of the Defence of the Realm Regulations but under section I of the Act of 60 Geo.* III (supra),&quot;The/
The Defence of the Realm Regulations were war time measures.     The statute of 60 Geo.&quot; Ill is part of the ordinary law of the land, and strikes at all illegal, drilling whether of Sinn Feiners or of Orangemen.   Onl? two facts require to be established, viz:-(1) the meeting of persons for drilling or practising military exercise or movements;(2) the absence of lawful authority for the meetings.I think that evidence sufficient to prove both facts will be made available should instructions with a view to prosecution be issued from tho Crown Office and I should be  lad to receive a decision on the question of policy raised at the earliest moment as there is a 6 months limit in the Statute within which proceedings must be taken.It Is In my opinion desirable that the decision should be reached before the neetin.3 of Parliament * I apprehend that Parliamentary questions may be put to the Secretary for Scotland on this subject.(Intd)     T,B*Ki15.10.20.
