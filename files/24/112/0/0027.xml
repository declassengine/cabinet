From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,ith October 1920.ient is the Pro;;- ,viV5a]ssty&apos;s Gove 1*nmeot.)Clear the line..2284. Your telegram of 24th September, 1139 S. Afghanistan. I agree with 1 you that decisive moment has arrived when we must be prepared to make firm offer to Afghans with object of bringing them definitely down on our side of fence. I also agree that defensive or offensive alliance cannot be contemplated. But I feel a good deal of hesitation about sanctioning gift of arms, &amp;c, without further consideration of consequences involved. Apart from risk of arms being used against us by . Afghans, which it may be necessary to face, there is further danger, having regard to weakness of Afghan army, of arms passing into hands of Bolsheviks as result of military defeat. It seems to me most undesirable to furnish Afghans with arms or equipment of such a character or on such a scale as might encourage them to engage Bolshevik troops in the open where they would be certain to be heavily defeated. If material assistance is to be given at all it should, in my opinion, be restricted to light equipment, rifles, machine guns and possibly light mountain guns which, while increasing Afghan efficiency in conduct of defensive guerilla warfare would not tempt them to court disaster by embarking on more ambitious operations. Condition precedent of any assistance must be signature of treaty of friendship on lines proposed, and, once this condition is fulfilled, would not best form of assistance to Amir be substantial money gift sufficient to relieve his more pressing pecuniary difficulties with his troops, &amp;c. ? It must be remembered that signature of treaty would restore to him right to import arms subject to Arms Traffic Convention,&quot;&quot;which is at present in abeyance. Afghan forces are probably adequately armed for immediate purposes, and it seems to me preferable that substantial increase of their armament should be postponed until Afghanistan is definitely faced by hostile aggression on part of Bolsheviks. Please reconsider matter in light of above remarks. I should be glad of further details as to quantity and nature of arms that you would propose to offer, and of maximum.amounts that you contemplate holding in reserve for this purpose.I regret delay caused by referring matter back to you. But I understand that at this season of the year there is little immediate danger of&apos;Bolshevik invasion of Afghanistan, and questions involved are too important to incur risk of premature decision. We must be careful not to allow Afghans to manoeuvre into position of keeping in with both sides and deriving material advantages from both while evading corresponding obligations.
