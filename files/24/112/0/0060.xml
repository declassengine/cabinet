In arriving at these conclusions the members of the Mission were unanimous.It is the intention of the Mission to furnish you in due course with a full report, giving an account of the method and course of our enquiry and containing the evidence &apos; and arguments on which the present memorandum is based. But inasmuch as the preparation of this full report will, in view of the great mass of material to be digested and arranged, require a good deal more time, and meanwhile His Majestys Government may be looking to us for guidance with regard to the immediate political situation in Egypt, we have thought it right to place our views on this branch of the subject before you without more elaboration. I hope that the urgency of the case will be held to excuse the summary and somewhat dogmatic form in which these views are presented.-I have, &amp;c.MIL NEE.
REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MISSION TO EGYPT.General Conclusions.I. The Present Situation and its Difficulties.THOUGH there has been no serious recurrence of the disorders of last spring, there is no diminution in anti-British feeling, and the Nationalist movement continues to grow in strength.Anti-British feeling is practically confined to the upper class and the intelli-genzia, and is strongest among the latter the students, doctors, lawyers and the bulk of the official class. Latterly it has also gained a strong hold on the Azhar, and Nationalism is now reinforced by Islamism.There is no general hostility to the British among the fellahin or smaller land-owners. Any manifestations of such hostility have been due to the influence of Nationalist emissaries from the towns, exploiting religious feeling or temporary grievances connected with the war. The most dangerous of these emissaries are the Azharites.The bulk of the fellahin and smaller landowners would regard the prospect of the withdrawal of British influence with alarm, fearing that it must lead to a renewal of oppression by the great landowners and the official class.It results from the foregoing considerations that actual rebellion is less to be apprehended than the progressive weakening of authority and respect for Government, arising from the disaffection of the upper and educated classes, and especially of the bulk of the native officials.This weakening of the authority of Government shows itself not only in the difficulty of checking sedition, with which the Native Courts are largely in sympathy, but in a general feebleness of administration and an increase in ordinary (non-political) crime.There can be no radical or permanent cure for this state of things except by such a reconciliation of British and Egyptians as will bring about a better understanding and heartier co-operation between the two elements and regain for the Government a certain measure of popular sympathy and support.Such a reconciliation can only be effected by a generous recognition of what is sound and legitimate in the aspirations of Egyptian Nationalism.The Nationalist movement, while embracing many evil tendencies and in its extreme form threatening a complete destruction of social order, nevertheless has its origin in the natural and. inevitable growth of the spirit of independence due to the increased prosperity, the spread of education and the greater individual freedom, which are the results of the British occupation.It should be the aim of British policy, by giving scope to this spirit of independence and to the increased capacity and desire of. the Egyptians to govern their own country, to win over the better elements of Nationalism and restore the spirit of good-will and co-operation between British and Egyptians in the work of Government.[In pursuing this policy we must take account of the sensitiveness of the Egyptians, of their self-importance and love of forms and phrases, and seek to give to . the future status of Egypt the greatest appearance of independence compatible with the maintenance of the absolutely indispensable minimum of British control]II. The Proposed Solution : A Treaty between Great Britain and Egypt.*This object could, in our opinion, be best attained by the conclusion of a treaty or convention between Great Britain and Egypt whereby Great Britain guaranteed the integrity and independence of Egypt and undertook to protect her against foreign, agression or interference and Egypt in return acknowledged the right of Great Britain to exercise a certain measure of control for the protection of British and foreign interests.
Great Britain&apos;s claim to exercise some measure of control over Egypt rests upon certain vital considerations, of which the following are the chief : (a.) It is essential for the welfare and progress of Egypt that the restrictions which the Capitulations impose upon her, especially in the matter of taxation of foreigners, should disappear, but Great Britain cannot insist on the surrender of these privileges without making herself responsible for the defence of the legitimate rights of foreigners.(b.) The great progress made by Egypt of recent years is the work of Great Britain, and Great Britain is entitled to watch over the results of her efforts until their continued maintenance is assured.(c.) A recurrence of disorder in Egypt, while menacing European interests in the interior of the country, would also involve danger to the Suez Canal, in which international highway Great Britain has a special interest by virtue of her part ownership of the Canal itself, of its importance as the road to India and Australasia, and of the fact that more than half the vessels using the Canal are British.In determining the measure of control which Great Britain must continue to exercise over Egypt, and for her right to exercise which any treaty must provide, we should be guided by the principle that it is desirable to restrict the direct exercise of British authority to the narrowest possible limits, and outside these limits to rely upon the moral influence of British officials serving under Egyptian Ministers in a genuinely Egyptian Administration.The object of any treaty being to effect a real reconciliation and to lead to more harmonious co-operation between British and Egyptians, great latitude must be left to the negotiators in settling details. A good deal that is not in itself desirable from the point of view of efficiency may have to be conceded in order to arrive at a genuine agreement, and put an end to the present friction, which threatens to result in a complete breakdown of the existing system of government.At the same time, certain fundamental positions cannot be abandoned without condemning the whole policy of agreement, which is necessarily an experiment, to failure. f ;The most important point to be safeguarded is the influence and prestige of the High Commissioner, who should remain in charge of the foreign relations of Egypt, in so far as they are of a political character, and be the recognised defender of the legitimate rights of foreigners in the country.The application to foreigners of any Egyptian legislation should therefore be conditional on the concurrence of the High Commissioner.At the same time, there should be an Egyptian High Commissioner in London to look after Egyptian interests, to be the exponent of the views of the Egyptian Government to the British Government and to supervise the selection of British officials for the Egyptian service.Great Britain, having undertaken the responsibility for the defence of Egypt, must have the right to retain a military force in that country, to make use of its harbours, aerodromes and lines of communication and to establish and maintain W/T stations.While Great Britain must retain complete freedom to determine the strength and distribution of the British forces in Egypt, it is obvious that, if a treaty such as is here contemplated were to be concluded, the strength of those forces could be reduced to very small proportions.. Great Britain&apos;s responsibility for the protection of foreign interests further involves a certain degree of control over the Egyptian Departments charged with the conduct of finance and with the maintenance of justice and public security.The exact form which this control should take is a matter for negotiation, but it will probably be found to involve the retention of at least two British advisers, with their staffs, in the Egyptian service. These must continue to be nominated by the British Government, and the extent of their authority should be clearly defined.With the exceptions aforesaid, the Egyptian Government should have complete control of Egyptian affairs, including the commercial relations of Egypt with foreign countries, and should have the right of concluding treaties of a non-political character with the assent of Great Britain.It follows from the preceding articles that the Egyptian Government must&apos; in future be free to determine, for itself, what posts in the Egyptian service, other than those to which Great Britain will retain the right to nominate, should be filled by
noil-Egyptians, but no non-Egyptians other than British should be so appointed except with the consent of the British Government.A period of a few years, say live, must be fixed during which the Egyptian Government should decide which of the existing British officials in the Egyptian service, other than those occupying posts to which the British Government retains the f right to nominate, should continue to be filled by British officials after the expiration of the fixed period Terms of retirement for those, whom the Egyptian Government does not wish to retain, should be arranged between the British and Egyptian Governments, and these terms must b.e generous. British officials, who do not wish to remain in the service of the Egyptian Government under the new conditions, should be allowed to retire on the same terms as those whom the Egyptian Government does not wish to retain.During the interim period, and after its termination, no British officials should be appointed to posts other than those to which the British Government retains the right to nominate, except at the request of the Egyptian Government.It is certain that, unless the Egyptian Government decides to retain the services of a considerable number of the more important British officials, the Egyptian adminis-tration will break down. But all sensible Egyptians are aware of this, and it is reasonable to suppose that, with the reconciliation of British and Egyptians, which it is the main object of the proposed treaty to effect, the Egyptian Government will itself desire to keep many, and those the best, of the British officials.The presence of an influential, if not very numerous, body of British officials in the Egyptian Service is necessary, not only for administrative efficiency, but in the interests of social justice. It is of special importance for the protection of the fellahin and of the poorer classes generally. &apos;[While the grosser forms of oppression and cruelty, under which the lower orders of Egyptians suffered before the occupation, are never likely to revive, less progress has been made in eradicating nepotism and corruption. These are still the besetting sins of the native official class and would, if British influence were altogether removed, undoubtedly lead to a return of many of the old abuses.The recurrence of these abuses would be especially dangerous in view of the grave economic and social problems with which Egypt is confronted at the present time.]The recent phenomenal increase of wealth in Egypt is not only precarious in itself, but its benefits are mainly confined to one class, the landowners, great and small. On the other hand, the landless portion of the peasantry and the lower orders of the towns are suffering terribly from the scarcity of essential foodstuffs and the rise of prices.The condition of Egypt to-day calls for a vigorous policy of social and agrarian reform to secure better conditions of life for the mass of the population.Nothing substantial can be achieved in this&apos; direction without more liberal expenditure for such purposes as education, public health and housing. &apos; A free revenue of little more than 20 millions is totally inadequate to cover the administrative requirements, general and local, of a population of 13,000,000, rapidly increasing, and is altogether below what the income of the country would justify. For this reason it is essential to get rid of the barrier which the Capitulations oppose to an increase of the sources of revenue and an equitable system of taxation.The same obstacle stands in the way of much legislation which is urgently required for purposes of social improvement.The difficult and delicate nature of the problems ahead makes it more necessary than ever to get rid of the existing friction between British and Egyptians, so that all available capacities may co-operate in working out essential reforms.Any treaty or convention regulating the relations of Great Britain and Egypt must at the same time define the general character of the future constitution of Egypt. In doing so, we must seek to safeguard individual liberty and the interests of the mass of the people.Within these limits it is desirable to leave the detail of the future constitution to be settled by the Egyptians themselves in a representative Assembly. &apos; The convocation of such an Assembly will, in any case, be necessary to confirm the proposed treaty between Great Britain and Egypt.III. The Immediate Future in Default of a Treaty.While the conclusion of a treaty on the above lines appears to us the most likely means of improving the existing situation, it is possible that this solution may encounter insuperable obstacles at the present time.
In that case it appears desirable still to keep the door open and to let it be clearly understood that Great Britain is at all times prepared to enter into a treaty with Egypt on the above lines; provided there is a reasonable prospect of its acceptance by the majority of the Egyptians and of their subsequent good-will and co-operation,, which it is the object of the treaty to ensure.Without the conclusion of such a treaty no relaxation of British control is either possible or desirable. Indeed, it may be necessary for Great Britain to undertake fresh responsibilities. It is impossible to allow the decline of governmental authority, due to the inherent weakness of the present system, to continue.IV. Administrative Reforms.Apart from the general questions of policy above discussed, there are certain changes in the organisation^ and spirit of the administration which are, in any case, desirable.(A.) The Residency.Owing to a variety of causes, of which the frequent changes of British agents and High Commissioners since the departure of Lord Cromer and the disturbing influences of the war have been the chief, British policy in Egypt, has of late years been fluctuating and incoherent. In the absence of consistent leadership, departments have gone their own way. Definiteness of aim and a clear.lead from the supreme direction are needed to re-establish discipline and co-ordination.In order to enable the High Commissioner to recover his authority, and to restore unity of purpose throughout the administration, the staff of the Residency should be reorganised. The chief aim of such reorganisation should be to ensure continuity, and the constant presence at the Residency of an adequate number of men of local knowledge and experience.The staffing of the Residency would be facilitated by the establishment of a single civil service for the Near East. If, as seems probable, it will be necessary to provide for a number of British officials in other Arab countries besides Egypt and the Soudan, the likelihood of obtaining men of the right stamp for the service of any of these countries, and of being able to make the best use of them, would be greatly enhanced by their interchangeability and by the prospects of a wider career than any that a number of small separate services can afford. We have been greatly impressed by the advantages of the limited measure of interchangeability which at present exists between the Soudan and Egypt.[Cairo is the best centre of information for the Islamic world, and the point from which British- policy in all the Arab countries could most efficiently be directed. If it were found possible, when Great Britain&apos;s responsibilities in the Near East have been denned, to give the High Commissioner at Cairo the general supervision over British activities in all the Arab countries, it would at the same time facilitate his task in controlling the Government of Egypt and make that control less obnoxious to the Egyptians.]The reorganisation of the Residency must be supplemented by a better system for dealing with Egyptian affairs in London. The questions which constantly arise with regard to Egypt are not wholly or mainly diplomatic, but administrative and political. Whether or not the control of British policy in Egypt is confided to a new department for the Middle East, it certainly requires, closer and more constant attention, supported by a greater degree of expert knowledge than it has hitherto received at home.(B.)  British Officials in the Egyptian Service.A great and&apos; increasing amount of criticism has been levelled, not only by. Egyptians, at the number of British officials in the Egyptian service. It is alleged to be excessive and constantly increasing, while the average quality of the men is said to be deteriorating.As regards the alleged excessive number of British officials, it is obvious that since the early days of the. occupation, when a relatively small number were appointed to co-operate in the Egyptian service and to -deal with comparatively simple problems, there has been, with the expansion of the administrative machine, a very large increase* Only recommendations of a general character can be included in this summary. Detailed suggestions with regard to several Departments are contained in the Appendices.
of the British personnel. The question to be examined is whether this increase has been unduly great, disproportionate to the increase in the number of Egyptian officials, and inconsistent with the original intention of the occupying Power, viz., to train Egyptian civil servants to fill the more responsible posts.We are of opinion that, when all necessary allowance has been made for the inevitable great expansion of the public service in Egypt and for the difficulty of finding Egyptians fully qualified to fill the higher posts, the complaint that the number of British officials is excessive is substantially justified, and that a sufficient effort has not been made to train Egyptians for positions of the greatest responsibility.* Only a small minority of these, under those of Ministers, are actually occupied by Egyptians, though when the latter are available they have good prospects of promotion. It should be a cardinal aim of the administration to increase their numbers by education and training and by a radical revision of the present system of non-Egyptian appoint-ments.It has been the practice of the administration to fill every post falling vacant which has once been occupied by a non-Egyptian with another non-Egyptian, without the reference to the Council of Ministers, which is required when a new non-Egyptian post is created. Under this system there is no prospective diminution in the number of British officials, while the expansion of the service and the creation of new departments has inevitably led to their increase through the addition of new posts. There is a further constant addition of British or non-Egyptians employed under contract for special services.In future, all appointments should be considered on their merits. When a British post falls vacant it should not be automatically filled by the appointment of another British official unless, after a careful review of all the circumstances, including legitimate claims of seniority to promotion, such an appointment is deemed essential. Similarly, in cases of promotion, and transfer, it should be considered whether the post vacated should not be filled by an Egyptian. There should be one Selection Board to supervise all non-Egyptian appointments carrying salaries of more than 300Z. a year, and the practice by which many departments select their own candidates without superior control should be discontinued.In cases where Europeans and Egyptians hold posts of the same nature, the basic salary should be the same, and an expatriation allowance (which would not count for pension) should be granted to Europeans serving in Egypt, or Egyptians serving out-side Egypt.As regards the second allegation the deterioration in quality of British officials--we do not consider it to be true. Egypt has been fortunate in past times in securing the services of men of outstanding ability. But in comparing all ranks of the service, present and past, there is, in our opinion, no ground for thinking.that its general quality has declined. The average standard of the upper grades would, we think,, compare not unfavourably with that of the corresponding grades in any Civil Service.During the years of the war in particular, loyal and disinterested service has been rendered by a body of officials who, in very difficult circumstances and with ^greatly depleted ranks, succeeded in carrying the country safely through a period of great stress and anxiety. The importance of these services is in no-way depreciated by the fact that a certain number of temporary officials, engaged owing to the urgency of war conditions, whose services have since been dispensed with, may have failed to reach the same high standard, and thus laid themselves open to legitimate criticism.What we have rather found to criticise has been a want of leadership and direction in the past, and an absence of that co-operation and co-ordination which should inspire the work of departments and their relations to one another. This has been undoubtedly felt by the British officials themselves, who have received no indication of the general policy in view, and have come to regard their respective departments as rivals in competition for development rather than as organic parts of the same machine working for a common end.There is a danger of the overgrowth of bureaucracy, of too much centralisation, correspondence and paper work. The number of officials in the lower grades is excessive. It is true that they are mostly Egyptians, but in these grades the British, except in certain technical services like the railways, are wholly out of place.As a consequence of the growth of office work, there has been a tendency for the British officials&apos; to spend more time in Cairo and to lose touch, with the life of the country districts.   This tendency, which was aggravated by the diversion of so many* Details supporting this conclusion will be found in an Appendix to the Report.
of them to war work, has had unfortunate results. As long as we remain in any degree responsible for the good government of Egypt, the constant presence of a certain number of-highly-qualified Englishmen in the provinces cannot possibly be dispensed with.(C.) Local Government.The Government of Egypt is still too exclusively in the hands of the official class. To check the growth of a centralised bureaucracy, increasingly out of touch with the people, it is desirable to foster local self-governing institutions, such as the provincial councils, the municipalities and the local commissions now established in a number of towns and even in some villages. The number of the latter should be increased, and the spirit of interest in local affairs, of which there are hopeful indications, should be in every way encouraged.The development of local self-governing institutions cannot, however, make much progress so long as an equitable system of local taxation is rendered impossible by the Capitulations. This is an additional reason for relieving Egypt from these international fetters.But while the removal of these fetters will facilitate the development of self-governing institutions in the towns and larger villages, the administration of the villages of small or moderate size, in which the bulk of the country people live, must still for many years to come be mainly in the hands of the Omdehs, or village headmen.The power of the Omdeh in an Egyptian village is very great and is frequently abused. The petty tyranny and corruption of which the Omdehs are often guilty, results in much suffering and discontent among the people, and is one-of the causes of the great prevalence of crime.The present method of appointing Omdehs by district committees under the presidency of a Government official is unsatisfactory. There is a strong feeling in favour of the election of the Omdeh in each village by the inhabitants themselves. Although,&apos; owing to the illiteracy of the people, it is difficult to carry out a system of secret voting, this should not prove insurmountable. It would be desirable to try the experiment of electing the Omdeh by ballot in a certain number of villages, and, if successful to extend it to the whole country.V.-The Capitulations and the Administration of Justice.The removal of the obstacles which the Capitulations present to the good govern-ment of the country can only be effected by closing the foreign Consular Courts and by finding an effective method of applying local legislation to foreigners and subjecting them to a fair share of taxation.The time is not ripe for unifying all the competing jurisdictions in Egypt (native, mixed, consular and religious). All that should be attempted at present is the fusion of the Mixed Courts and the Consular Courts, the Native and Religious Courts being left untouched. In carrying through this amalgamation, the Mixed Courts should be relieved as far as possible of purely administrative services, such as the registry of land deeds and mortgages.. The special position which Great Britain occupies, and must continue to occupy, in Egypt is now generally recognised by the foreign Powers. That special position imposes upon her responsibility for safeguarding the rights of foreigners, and therefore entitles her to claim that foreign Powers should enable her to discharge that responsibility and should confide to her that protection of the interests of their nationals in Egypt which is now assured by&apos; the Capitulations. Egypt will then, in matters affecting foreigners, be in a position to deal with Great Britain alone instead of having to approach each individual Power.Great Britain must accordingly be the Power entitled to express any consent which, up till now, the Egyptian Government has been obliged to obtain from a foreign Government or from an international authority in Egypt. All privileges hitherto enjoyed in connection with the appointment of judges, the commutation of sentences, the application to foreigners of Egyptian legislation, or the payment by foreigners of Egyptian taxation, should be vested in Great Britain and exercised through the High Commissioner. *Foreign litigants should, so far as possible, enjoy in the reconstituted Mixed Courts the same privileges as those they enjoy in the existing Mixed Courts.   For the &apos;
extended criminal jurisdiction which these Courts will hereafter possess, a criminal procedure must be found which will give general satisfaction. In framing any new codes to be applied by the reconstituted Mixed Courts, particularly in framing a new Criminal Procedure Code, members of the Mixed Bar, representing the various foreign colonies, should be invited to take part.The prestige and the independence which the Mixed Courts have enjoyed in the past must be scrupulously maintained. It would be disastrous if the opinion became prevalent that attempts were being made to undermine the independence and the authority of these Courts.If the power to approve legislation so as to make it binding on foreigners is vested in the High Commissioner in lieu of the individual Governments, or of the General. Assembly of the Mixed Court of Appeal, as heretofore, an Advisory Committee, representing the various foreign communities, should be constituted to advise him as to the approval of such legislation. The members of this Committee should be elected by the foreign colonies they represent and the numerical strength of these colonies should be taken into account in determining the number of their representatives.The agreement with each of the foreign Powers for closing its Consular Court and for transferring to His Majesty&apos;s Government the exercise of.its rights under the Capitulations should contain an assurance that the nationals of that Power shall stand on the same footing as British subjects in Egypt in all such matters as the administra-tion of justice, commercial and industrial liberty, the right to hold property and the payment of taxation.The fusion of the Mixed and Consular Courts will not affect the Native Courts, and no great change in their organisation seems called for at present. . The new Codes^-of which the preparation was commenced by the Capitulations Commission  are urgently required, and they should be completed and carried into effect with as little delay as possible.The special regime, established in the Western and Eastern Deserts and in the Sinai Peninsular by the Frontier Districts Administration, should be maintained, and the jurisdiction of the Military Courts set up there should be preserved. In civil cases the jurisdiction of these Courts should be concurrent with that of the other Egyptian. Courts. ^YI.  He presen tati ve Institutions.If such a Treaty as is contemplated in Section II above were to be concluded, the powers of the Egyptian Legislature of the future would be determined by the Egyptians themselves, and it would be for them, to say how far they desired to go in the direction of responsible government. In that case it is probable that the establishment of complete parliamentary control over the executive would, at any rate, be attempted. But even in default of such a Treaty it is desirable to foster the growth of representative institutions.The only organ of national self-government at present existing in Egypt is the Legislative Assembly, which has important, though limited, powers with respect to legislation and taxation.The sessions ot the Legislative Assembly have been suspended during the war, and it is doubtful whether they could now be resumed without a general election. It may be impossible to hold such an election while the present agitation is at fever heat, but we are strongly of opinion that, at the first favourable opportunity, the Legislative Assembly should be revived and should thenceforward continue to hold annual sessions.It is to be expected that the Legislative Assembly, whenever it is revived, will adopt a very critical, if not hostile, attitude to the Government, but attacks upon the Government in a representative Assembly, which is bound to have some sense of responsibility, cannot be more damaging or less helpful than those which are now incessantly directed against it by a wholly irresponsible press.The Assembly will also, no doubt, be constantly striving to increase its own powers, especially with regard to the control of finance. But this is the normal course of constitutional development, and as a representative Assembly gains in experience and authority, it is only right that its control over finance should extend till it finally becomes complete.In any case, it is not just to condemn the Legislative Assembly because of the somewhat discouraging results of its first session in 1914. Both as a legitimate outlet for the expression of public feeling, and as a check on the bureaucratic engine, a representative Assembly is essential to the healthy development of political life in, Egypt.
At the same time it must be borne in mind that, owing to the backwardness of the mass of the people, of whom 90 per cent, are still quite illiterate, it will be many years before any elected Assembly is really representative of more than a comparatively limited class. Parliamentary government under the present social conditions means oligarchical government, and, if wholly uncontrolled, it would be likely to show too little regard for the interests of the majority of the Egyptian people.The history of British, rule in Egypt, especially in its earlier stages, has been marked by some great and striking improvements in the condition of the fellahin, and as long as Great Britain continues to exercise any measure of control over the internal affairs of Egypt it is both our duty and our interest to use our influence for the promotion of further reforms necessary for the protection of the mass of the people and for their advancement in education and capacity for self-government.Whatever may be the immediate future, it seems to us essential that the British Administration in Egypt should make a far greater effort than heretofore to establish, contact with the Egyptian people, to explain its policy and to refute the misstatements of fact which form so large a part of the campaign against it in the Egyptian news-papers. The time is past when British representatives can, in reliance on their own good intentions, permit a stream of uninformed criticism to continue without an effort&apos; to correct it; and if the Legislative Assembly is to resume its sittings and Egyptians are to obtain a greater control of their own affairs, it will be more than ever necessary that the essential objects of British policy in Egypt should be kept constantly before the Egyptian people.Speeches or statements in the British Houses of Parliament will not of themselves meet this necessity. These, as we have frequently observed during our stay in Egypt, are liable to distortion in transmission or translation, and become a fruitful source of misunderstanding and recrimination. Nor is it sufficient that warnings and contradic-tions should be issued to the newspapers. Positive explanations of British aims and policy must be conveyed to the Egyptian people either in public speeches or communications to the press, and the heads of the administration must be prepared to take an active part in defending their measures when challenged. In this, as in many other respects, a vigorous initiative, in place of a passive acceptance of adverse circumstances, is a primary condition of successful administration.VII. The Soudan.None of the preceding paragraphs have any application to the Soudan. That country is physically, ethnically and historically quite distinct from Egypt, and in some respects presents a sharp contrast to it.While the great majority of the people of Egypt are comparatively homogeneous, the Soudan is divided between Arabs and Negroids, and within each. of these two great racial groups there are a number of races and tribes differing widely from one another and often mutually antagonistic.But while thus greatly divided amongst themselves, the Soudanese are at one in their dislike of the Egyptians. That dislike grew to hatred in consequence of the gross misgovernment of the Soudan in the days of the Khedive Ismail. And though, as the memory of former Egyptian oppression fades, this hatred is dying out, the great diversity of character between Egyptians and all classes of Soudanese is calculated to keep up a certain antipathy between them.This diversity, however, is much greater in some cases than in others. The Arabs of the Soudan speak dialects of the same language as the Egyptians and are united to them by the bond of religion. Islam, moreover, is spreading even among the non-Arab races of the Soudan. These influences mitigate in various degrees, but they nowhere wholly overcome the differences of race and character which divide the Egyptians from the Soudanese.The political bonds which have at intervals in the past united Egypt with the Soudan have always been fragile. Egyptian conquerors have at various times overrun parts and even the whole of the Soudan. But it has never been really subdued by, or in any sense amalgamated with, Egypt. The Egyptian conquest of the Soudan in the last century was especially disastrous for both countries. After years of bloodshed and oppression, which failed to establish orderly government for any length of time, Egyptian rule was finally overthrown by the Mahdist rebellion, and the Egyptians were driven out of all but a small corner of the Soudan. As a consequence of this ,break,down, Great Britain was obliged to undertake several costly expeditions for the[3221] &quot; C
rescue of the Egyptian garrisons and the defence of Egypt, which was in danger of being overrun by the Mahdist hordes.Since the reconquest of the country by British and Egyptian forces under British leadership in 1896-8, the Government of the Soudan, which under the Convention of .1899 takes the form of an Anglo-Egyptian Protectorate, has been virtually in British hands. The Governor-General, though appointed by the Sultan (formerly the Khedive) of Egypt, is nominated by the British Government, and all the Governors of Provinces and principal officials are British.Under this system of government, the progress of the Soudan in all respects, material and moral, has been remarkable. When full allowance is made for the simplicity of the problem, viz., the introduction of the first principles of orderly and civilised government among a very primitive people, the great success actually achieved during the long Governor-Generalship of Sir R. Wingate is one of the brightest pages in the history of British rule over backward races. The present administration is popular in the Soudan and, with few exceptions, peaceful and progressive conditions prevail throughout the country.While Egypt and the Soudan are essentially separate countries, and are bound to develop on very different lines, Egypt will always have one interest of supreme importance in the Soudan. The Nile, upon which the very existence of Egypt depends, flows for hundreds of miles through the Soudan, and it is vital to Egypt to prevent any such diversion of water from the Nile as might diminish her present cultivable area or preclude the reclamation of that portion of her soil, some 2,000,000 acres in extent, which is capable of being brought under cultivation, when, by means of storage, the present supply of water available for irrigation has been increased.Hitherto the amount of water drawn from the Nile in its passage through the Soudan has been of negligible amount, but as the population of the Soudan increases that country will require more water for its own development and a conflict of interest between it and Egypt might arise. At the same time there is every reason to hope that, properly conserved and distributed, the Nile will suffice for the irrigation of all the lands, whether in Egypt or the Soudan, which are ever likely to need it.The natural arbiter in this matter is Great Britain, which not only commands the sources of the White Nile, but is equally interested in the welfare and development of both Egypt and the Soudan, and has a special interest of her own in the increase of the cultivation of cotton, the most valuable product of the soil of Egypt and one which certain portions of the Soudan are likewise well fitted to supply.A number of large engineering works for the storage of water and for raising the level of the river will have to be undertaken in the Soudan, and ultimately perhaps also in Uganda, in order that the Nile may yield the maximum benefit in respect of irrigation to the countries through which it flows. Plans for two such works in the Soudan are already projected, and these schemes, which have given rise to much controversy, are at present the subject of enquiry by a commission of technical experts.The control of the waters of the Nile for purposes of irrigation is a matter of such paramount importance and the technical and other problems involved are so difficult and intricate that it is, in our opinion, necessary to set up a permanent commission, composed on the one hand of experts of the highest authority and on the other hand of representatives of all the countries affected-Egypt, the Soudan and Uganda to settle all questions affecting the regulation of the river and to ensure the fair distribution of the water.While the contiguity of Egypt and the Soudan and their common interest in the Nile make it desirable that some political nexus between the two countries should always be maintained, it is out of the question that this connection should take &quot;the form of the subjection of the Soudan to Egypt. The former country is capable of and entitled to independent development in accordance with its own character and requirements.It is much too early to attempt to determine the ultimate political status of the Soudan. For present purposes that status is sufficiently defined by the Convention of 1899 between Great Britain and Egypt, which provides for the necessary political connection between Egypt and the Soudan without hampering the independent development of the latter country.While it is absolutely necessary for the present to maintain a single supreme authority over the whole of the Soudan, it is not desirable that the government of that country should be highly centralised. Having regard to its vast extent and the varied character of its inhabitants, the administration of its different parts should be left, as
far as possible, in the hands of the native authorities, wherever they exist, underv British supervision.   A centralised bureaucracy on the Egyptian model is wholly unsuitable for the Soudan.Decentralisation and the employment, wherever possible, of native agencies for the simple administrative needs of the country, in its present stage of development, would both make for economy and avoid the necessity of retaining a large number of Egyptian officials in the civil service of the Soudan.This necessity ought, in any case, to disappear as education progresses and a greater number of Soudanese themselves become capable of tilling official posts. At the present time the officials of local origin are still largely outnumbered by those introduced from Egypt.The gradual substitution of Soudanese for Egyptians in the Civil Service is not recommended because of any failure of the latter adequately to discharge their present duties. The introduction of Egyptians after the reconquest was necessitated by the circumstances of the time, and under undivided British control they have done their duty loyally and well. But service in the Soudan is not popular with Egyptians, and it is only natural that they should be replaced by men of local origin as the latter become capable of doing the work.[There is another reason for limiting as far as possible the Egyptian element in the administration. As has already been stated, Nationalism pervades the Egyptian Civil Service, and is strongest amongst its younger members. It is undesirable to multiply propagandists of Egyptian Nationalism in the Soudan. Egyptian Nationalism has its good as well as its bad side in Egypt. But it has no raison detre in the Soudan, and its introduction into that country is simply an element of disturbance without any corresponding advantage.] ^The capacity of the Soudanese to take the place of imported officials in the Civil Service depends on the progress of education. At the same time we should be careful, in the matter of education, not to repeat the mistake which has been made in Egypt of adopting a system which fits pupils for little else than employment in clerical and minor administrative posts, and creates an overgrown body of aspirants to Government employment. There is no room in the Soudan for a host of petty officials, and education should be directed to giving the Soudanese a capacity and a taste for employment in other directions, such as agriculture, industry, commerce and engineering. The immediate need of the country is material development, and it can do without an elaborate administrative system.The military forces still employed in the Soudan are very large. A large army was, no doubt, required to complete the conquest and pacification of the country, but the time has come when, in our opinion, the question of the number and organisation of its military forces should be reconsidered.[The military forces in the Soudan are part of the Egyptian army, though more than half of them consist of regiments recruited in the Soudan, and they are all paid for by Egypt. Hitherto, the Governor-General ship of the Soudan and the Command-in-Chief of the Egyptian army have been united in one person. There were good reasons for this in the past, but it is indefensible as a permanent arrange-ment At the first convenient opportunity a civil Governor-General should be appointed, and the Sirdar of the Egyptian army, with his headquarters staff, should be re-transferred to Egypt.It is a matter for consideration whether those regiments of the army which are composed of Egyptians should not be brought back to Egypt and the remaining Soudanese regiments converted into a local gendarmerie. The duties which the Soudanese regiments at present discharge are rather those of a gendarmerie than of an army proper. A small striking force will always be required at the centre, but for the rest, order and security would be better maintained by a number of bodies locally recruited and commanded by British officers. This would both facilitate recruiting, as it is much easier to get men to serve in their own districts than in a force which may be employed far away from them, and reduce the financial burden on Egypt of maintaining an army in the Soudan, which now costs as much as li millions a year.]The revenue of the Soudan only just defrays the cost of its civil administration, and though, with the development of the country the revenue will certainly increase, its growth may for some years to come not be very rapid. Egypt will therefore in the immediate future still have to bear the main, if not the whole, burden of the military establishment.This is an undesirable state of things. It is an additional argument for trying to reduce the military expenditure of the Soudan to more reasonable proportions that this
reduction will help to relieve the Soudan from all financial dependence on Egypt at an earlier date than would otherwise be possible. The sooner the finances of the two countries can be entirely separated the better.Whenever that separation can be effected it will be necessary to take account of the expenditure which Egypt has incurred on behalf of the Soudan since its reconquest and to fix the amount which the Soudan can be fairly asked to repay and the terms on which it should be liquidated. In determining that amount it would be reasonable to take into consideration the benefits which Egypt has herself derived from her expenditure in the Soudan.Meanwhile something should be done immediately to draw a clearer line of division between Egyptian and Soudanese finance. At the same time, the Financial Department of the Soudan should be simplified and cheapened and its control over other departments rendered less rigid. An Auditor-General should be appointed, who should be independent of all departments.There has of late days been an increasing tendency on the part of the more extreme section of Egyptian Nationalists to call in question the/ Convention of 1899, which defines the political status of the Soudan. While advocating &quot;complete independence &quot; for Egypt, they lay claims to the Soudan as an exclusively Egyptian possession. This contention is totally inadmissible. Any treaty which may be concluded between Great Britain and Egypt must provide for the recognition of that Convention and establish the relations of the two countries for the future upon a basis which will secure the independent development of the Soudan while safeguarding the vital interests of Egypt in the waters of the Nile.Egypt has an indefeasible right to an ample and assured supply of water for the land at present under cultivation and to a fair share of any increased supply which engineering skill may be able to provide. A formal declaration on the part of Great Britain that she recognises this right and is resolved under all circumstances to uphold it would go far to allay the uneasiness which prevails in Egypt on this subject. We are of opinion that such a declaration might with advantage be made at the present time.M.II. E. J. G. M. 0. T. J. A. S. C. J. B. H.March 3, 1920.
No. 2.Earl Curzon to Mr. Scott (Cairo).(No. 751.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Foreign Office, August 21, 1920.THE accompanying memorandum is the result of conversations held in London in June to August 1920 between Lord Milner and the members of the special mission to Egypt and Zaghlul Pasha and the members of the Egyptian Delegation, in which conversations Adly Pasha also took part. It outlines a policy for the settlement of the Egyptian question in the best interests both of Great Britain and Egypt.The members of the mission are prepared to recommend the British Government to adopt the policy indicated in the memorandum if they are satisfied that Zaghlul Pasha and the delegation are likewise prepared to advocate it, and will use all their influence to obtain the assent of an Egyptian National Assembly to the conclusion of such a treaty as is contemplated in articles 3 and 4.It is clear that unless both parties are cordially united in supporting it, the policy here suggested cannot be pursued with success.Memorandum.1. In order to establish the independence of Egypt on a secure and lasting basis it is necessary that the relations between Great Britain and Egypt should be precisely defined, and the privileges and immunities now enjoyed in Egypt by the capitulatory Powers should be modified and rendered less injurious to the interests of the country.2. These ends cannot be achieved without further negotiations between accredited representatives of the British and Egyptian Governments respectively in the one case, and between the British Government and the Governments of the capitulatory Powers in the other case. Such negotiations will be directed to arriving at definite agreements on the following lines: 3. (1.) As between Egypt and Great Britain it is proposed that a treaty should be entered into, under which Great Britain will recognise the independence of Egypt as a constitutional monarchy with representative institutions, and Egypt will confer upon Great Britain such rights as are necessary to safeguard her special interests and to enable her to furnish the guarantees which must be given to foreign Powers to secure the relinquishment of their capitulatory rights.(2.) By the same treaty, an alliance will be concluded between Great Britain and Egypt, by which Great Britain will undertake to support Egypt in defending the integrity of her territory; and Egypt will undertake, in case of war, even when the integrity of Egypt is not affected, to render to Great Britain all the assistance in her power within her own borders, including the use of her harbours, aerodromes and means of communication for military purposes.4. The proposed treaty will embody stipulations to the following effect: (1.) Egypt will enjoy the right;to representation in foreign countries. In the absence of any duly-accredited Egyptian representative, the Egyptian Government will confide its interests to the care of the British representative. Egypt will under-take not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or will create difficulties for Great Britain, and will also undertake not to enter into any agreement with a foreign Power which is prejudicial to British interests.(2.) Egypt will confer on Great Britain the right to maintain a military force on Egyptian soil for the protection of her Imperial communications. The treaty will fix the place where the force shall be quartered, and will regulate any subsidiary matters which require to be arranged. The presence of this force shall, not constitute in any manner a military occupation of the country or prejudice the rights of the Govern-ment of Egypt.(3.) Egypt will appoint, in concurrence with His Majesty&apos;s Government, a Financial Adviser, to whom shall be entrusted in due course the powers at present[4 551 a]
exercised &quot;by the Commissioners of the Debt, and who will be at the disposal of the Egyptian Government for all other matters on which they may desire to consult him.(4.) Egypt will appoint, in concurrence with His Majesty&apos;s Government, an olficial in the Ministry of Justice, who shall enjoy the right of access to the Minister. He shall be kept fully informed on all matters connected with the administration of the ( law as affecting foreigners, and will also be at the disposal of the Egyptian Govern-irient for consultation on any matter connected with the efficient maintenance of law and order.(5.) In view of the contemplated transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the rights hitherto exercised under the regime of the Capitulations by the various foreign Governments, Egypt recognises the right of Great Britain to intervene, through her representative in Egypt, to prevent the application to foreigners of any Egyptian law now requiring foreign consent, and Great Britain on her side undertakes not to exercise this right except in the case of laws operating inequitably against foreigners.Alternative.In view of the contemplated transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the rights hitherto exercised under the regime of the Capitulations by the various foreign Governments, Egypt recognises the right of Great Britain to intervene, through her representative in Egypt, to prevent the application to foreigners of any Egyptian law now requiring foreign consent, and Great Britain on her side undertakes not to exercise this right except in the case of laws inequitably discriminating against foreigners in the matter of taxation, or inconsistent with the principles of legislation common to all the capitulatory Powers.(b\) On account of the special relations between Great Britain and Egypt created by the alliance, the British representative will be accorded an exceptional position in Egypt, and will be entitled to precedence over all other representatives.(7.) The engagements of British and other foreign officers and administrative officials who entered into the service of the Egyptian Government before the coming into force of the treaty, may be terminated at the instance of either the officials themselves or the Egyptian Government at any time within two years after the coming into force of the treaty. The pension or compensation to be accorded to officials retiring under this provision, in addition to that provided by the existing law, shall be determined by the treaty. In cases where no advantage is taken of this arrangement, existing terms of service will remain unaffected.5. This treaty will be submitted to the approval of a Constituent Assembly, but it will not come into force until after the agreements with foreign Powers for the closing of their Consular Courts and the decrees for the reorganisation of the Mixed Tribunals have come into operation.li. This Constituent Assembly will also be charged with the duty of framing a new Organic Statute, in accordance with the provisions of which the Government of Egypt will in future be conducted. This statute will embody previsions for the Ministers being responsible to the Legislature. It will also provide for religious toleration for all persons and for the due protection of the rights of foreigners.7. The necessary modifications in the regime of the Capitulations will be secured by agreements to be concluded by Great Britain with the various capitulatory Powers. These agreements will provide for the closing of the foreign Consular Courts, so as to render possible the reorganisation and extension of the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals and the application to all foreigners in Egypt of the legislation (including legislation imposing taxation) enacted by the Egyptian Legislature.8. These agreements will provide for the transfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the rights previously exercised under the regime of the Capitulations by the various foreign Governments.   They will also contain stipulations to the following effect(a.) No attempt will be made to discriminate against the nationals of a Power which agrees to close its Consular Courts, and such nationals shall enjoy in Egypt the same treatment as British subjects.(b.) The Egyptian Nationality Law will be founded on the jus sanguinis,, so that the children born in Egypt of a foreigner will enjoy the nationality of their father and will not be claimed as Egyptian subjects.(c.) Consular officers of the foreign Powers shall be accorded by Egypt the same status as foreign consuls enjoy in England.(d.) Existing treaties and conventions to which Egypt is a party on matters of commerce and navigation, including postal and telegraphic conventions, will remain in
force. Pending the conclusion of special agreements to which she is a party, Egypt will apply the treaties in force between Great Britain and the foreign Power concerned on questions affected by the closing of the Consular Courts, such as extradition treaties, treaties for the surrender of seamen deserters, &amp;c, as also treaties of a political nature, whether multilateral or bilateral, e.g., arbitration conventions and the various conven-tions relating to the conduct of hostilities.(e.) The liberty to maintain schools and to teach the language of the foreign country concerned will be guaranteed, provided that such schools are subject in all respects to the laws applicable generally to European schools in Egypt.(/.) The liberty to maintain or organise religious and charitable foundations, such as hospitals, &amp;c, will also be guaranteed.The treaties will also provide for the necessary changes in the Commission of the Debt and the elimination of the international element in the Alexandria Board of Health.9. The legislation rendered necessary by the aforesaid agreements between Great Britain and the foreign Powers will be effected by decrees to be issued by the Egyptian government.A decree shall be enacted at the same time validating all measures, legislative, administrative or judicial, taken under martial law.10. The decrees for the reorganisation of the Mixed Tribunals will provide for conferring upon these tribunals all jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the foreign Consular Courts, while leaving the jurisdiction of the Native Courts untouched.11. After the coming into force of the treaty referred to in article 3, Great Britain will communicate its terms to foreign Powers and will support an application by Egypt for admission as a member of the League of Nations.
No. 3.Farl Curzon to Mr. Scott (Cairo).(No. 750.)(Telegraphic) Foreign Office, August 21, 1920.LORD MILNER has handed me the document of which the full text is contained in my immediately following telegram, and has informed me that copies have been given by him to Adly Pasha for communication to Zaghlul and his associates.Zaghlul has already returned to France, and the rest of his party followed him on 19th August.  Adly Pasha has also left.I understand from Lord Milner that four of Zaghufs followers will return to Egypt next month in order to persuade the country to support a settlement on the lines which the Mission are disposed to recommend.His Majesty&apos;s Government have not yet considered the policy indicated in my immediately following telegram, and in the absence of the Prime Minister and of most of the members of the Cabinet, such consideration must necessarily be deferred.It is on this clear understanding that the memorandum quoted in my immediately following telegram is sent for your information and that of the Sultan and his Ministers ; it is not intended for publication, but as Zaghlul and his associates are acquainted with it, and will base their campaign upon it, the main points are certain to become generally known.Lord Milner states that the conversations between his Mission and the Zaghlulists were conducted in a friendly and conciliatory spirit on both sides, and though no actual agreement has been reached, it is evident that the Egyptians are anxious for a settlement. In these circumstances, though the arrival of ZaghluFs emissaries in Egypt will probably cause a certain amount of excitement and a revival of political controversy, it is not desirable to interfere with their activities as long as these are kept within reasonable bounds, nor to use the censorship to check the discussion of the proposed settlement in the press. It would be a good thing if in the meantime the case of the men at present under trial could be disposed of one way or the other and this element of possible disturbance got out of the way.Should the reception of the Zaghlulist campaign in Egypt prove so favourable as to warrant the mission making recommendations on the lines indicated, and should His Majesty&apos;s Government be prepared to endorse them, it is obvious that in the subsequent negotiations the Sultan would have to take the lead and depute properly accredited representatives to deal with His Majesty&apos;s Government.[4551 b]
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.].--313Printed for the Cabinet,   October 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.-  K    No. 4,THE EGYPTIAN PROPOSALS. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,THE decision at which His Majesty&apos;s Government must arrive upon Lord Milner&apos;s proposals is one of the most momentous that will ever have been&apos; taken by a British Government, not only in its effect on Egypt itself, but- in its reaction on.- every country in the East towards which we act in a governing, or fiduciary, or mandatory capacity. For what is given to Egypt, over which we have solemnly declared our Protectorate scarcely six years ago, can with difficulty be withheld from other countries, whose national spirit is equally clamant and assertive. We are therefore not merely solving a difficulty, but creating a precedent. The Cabine&apos;t have already had a memorandum from the Secretary of State for War, expressing grave alarm at the proposals, and a general reply from Lord Milner. They will desire to hear the Foreign Office point of view, which has not been arrived at except after a prolonged discussion of the case with Lord Milner and Lord Allenby.Position of the Case,In May last I received a letter from Lord Milner forwarding the general conclusions arrived at by his Mission at the end of their sojourn in Egypt. In this letter a full. Report was promised at a later date, but has not been received. I was under the impression that the condensed and earlier Report had been issued by the Cabinet; but, as this appears not to have been done, 1 circulate it with this paper.Towards the end of August, just as Parliament was separating, Lord Milner sent to the Foreign Office a further memorandum reporting&apos; the results of his conversations with Zaghloul Pasha, Adly Pasha, and other prominent Egyptians, who had been invited to London to assist in the deliberations of the Mission. This memorandum contained the outlines oi a complete scheme for establishing the independence of Egypt by means of a Treaty of Alliance and for surrendering the British Protectorate, while retaining a certain position of predominance or superior influence for Great Britain. The scheme had been prepared quite independently of the Foreign Office, but it represented, I understood, the unanimous views of Lord Milner and his colleagues, and it had the support of the Egyptian politicians above mentioned, who were prepared to return to Egypt and to advocate it there. The scheme had not, of course, the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Had not the Cabinet already adjourned, I should have at once arranged for its submission to my colleagues. As it was, the utmost that could be done, as Lord Milner pressed for its transmission to Cairo, in order to prevent erroneous versions from getting abroad, was to inform the British representative there that the proposals had not been considered by the British Government, but were sent not for publication but for his information, and that of the Sultan and his Ministers. As a matter of fact, the Nationalist party did not hesitate to introduce into their version of the scheme features which formed no part of it.Nevertheless, the scheme in its broad outlines has been received in Egypt by the members of the old Legislative Assembly and by Nationalist opinion in general with a good deal of satisfaction, and there seems every reason to suppose that, if it be endorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it will be in the long run accepted in-Egypt. This, indeed, is not surprising, considering the large and ample concessions that have been made to native sentiment, which can hardly have expected so substantial a victory. How far the final decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been prejudiced or compromised by these events it is difficult precisely to say. No doubt the Nationalist party in Egypt will already have invested the scheme prepared by such high authority with an almost sacrosanct character, and will resent or resist any substantial modification of its terms. Due weight must be attached to this considera-tion. But it.cannot be allowed to prevent us from examining minutely the proposals themselves, both individually and collectively; and if, in the interests either of Great Britain in Egypt or of the British Empire, His Majesty&apos;s Government find it necessary[4551 c] B
to introduce certain modifications, this will, I think, be,generally recognised as falling within, not merely our powers, but our duty. Nor can I believe that even the&apos;general considerations, to which Lord Milner has given such powerful expression in his reply to Mr. Churchill, and with the spirit of which I entirely concur, need commit ,us to an unqualified acceptance of his scheme, or debar the Egyptians themselves from accepting such changes as, after a full discussion with them, we may decide to insist upon. It is from this point of view that I submit.the.dEollowing comments.-Nature of the Proposals.Broadly speaking, Lord milner  proposes to convert Egypt from a British Protectorate.into an independent Sovereign State,, ruled by. a constitutional sovereign, a, representative Assembly, and an Egyptian Ministry responsible to that Assembly. The executive will be Egyptian, assisted in an; advisory or subordinate capacity by such British officials as the Egyptian Government may decide to employ or retain. The police and the army, will.be, with an important -exception to be named presently, Egyptian forces, and the maintenance of law&apos;, and order will be an exclusively Egyptian responsibility. There will be an Egyptian Foreign Office, with an Egyptian Foreign Minister at Cairo and Egyptian diplomatic representatives in London and in other capitals. The Egyptian Government will be able to pass such legislation and to take such administrative action as it pleases, subject, to..a certain power of supervision by the British High Commissioner in cases affecting foreigners. The two British advisers, Financial and Judicial, upon whom it is proposed to insist,&quot;, will be merely advisers; and already an attempt is being made by the Nationalist party in Egypt still further to emphasise their subordination. Taxation will be in the hands of the native Government, provided that they do not discriminate against foreigners. They will be able to conclude commercial or other treaties: The whole of these conditions are to be laid down in a; treaty concluded between Great - Britain and; Egypt.    &apos;.-     &quot; y\        &apos;   . 1 - y &apos;y -&quot;M v ;     1 &apos;; - y   y;&apos; -On the other hand, the reality or the relics of British&apos;authority in Egypt^--whichever it be-are to be demonstrated by the following arrangements&quot; 1There is to be a British High Commissioner in Egypt who &quot; will be accorded.an exceptional position and will be entitled to precedence.pyer.other, representatives.&quot;, He is to have the right to intervene in cases where foreigners are likely to. be unfavourably affected by Egyptian legislation. These are the sole powers specifically mentioned in the memorandum. There is to be a British military force in Egypt, but it is not to be a garrison, and its numbers and location are to be determined by. imperial as distinct from local considerations. In times of war Egypt is; to render such military assistance to Great Britain as may. be. within her means. Abroad she is to undertake &quot;not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or will create difficulties for Great Britain, and not to enter into any agrees ment with a foreign Power which is prejudicial to British interests.&apos;;,Military Position.I will first examine the military position.   The strength of the British military; force is not stated, and is left to be determined. -The Egyptians will probably seek&apos;to define its numbers. Lord Milner is, I believe, hopeful that a total strength of something-between 3,000-5,000 will suffice.&apos; On the other hand the treaty is to fix the plade&apos; (not places) where it shall be quartered.   Lord Milner has in mind some locality contiguous to the Canal, and in any case on its western side, probably in the neighbour-hood of Ismailia.   Now let us1 see what functions this army is to; perform.   Ifc*is; intended primarily &quot;for the protection of Imperial communications,&quot; le., first and1 foremost the Canal, but also, I imagine, such railroads, harbours, and aerodromes as are apartof the scheme of necessary Imperial communications.   This does not appear to be-made sufficiently clear.in the memorandum, which speaks of these resources as only&apos; being available to the British &quot; in case of war &quot;-a limitation which is probably not1 intended.Secondly, Great Britain is to &quot; undertake to support Egypt in defending the integrity of her territory.&quot;   Now Egyptian territory may be attacked either by seay it if which case the British Navy will ex hypothesi proceed to her defence, or by land; and land attacks maybe delivered from any of three quarters-: (i) the&apos;Sen&apos;ouasillOHf the west; (ii) Bedouinsj Arabs, or Syrians on the east and south-east; (iii)-but&apos;less-
likely African tribes from the south. In the event of the Egyptian Army being inadequate for the purpose,, oruhaving been defeated by the enemy, the British Imperial force will then be called upon &quot;to support  Egypt in defending the integrity of her territory.&quot; Jn other/words, itimay conceivably be required for- Egyptian, as distinct fromiImperial purposes, and,be called,upon to fight inside or on the frontiers of the country. ,     - ..Lastly, though this is not mentioned, it is easy to conceive circumstances in which; in the event of internal rebellion,1 fanatical outbreaks, or grave disorder endangering European life and property in the.  owns-which the native army might be either unable or unwilling to quell an appeal might be made.for the assistance of the British Imperial force which it would be difficult to refuse.t, In other words, if 11 am. right,, this force may conceivably find itself committed to action on a wider scale than that-which is contemplated in the proposed treaty. Y &quot;, Even in its Imperial aspect I imagine that this army cannot be considered only in terms of Egypt or the Canal. The position of Egypt renders it the inevitable and indispensable centre of British military strategy and operations in the Middle East. If British forces are to be maintained in Palestine, they can-hardly be altogether severed from the Egyptian command. If military operations are at. any time called for in Western Arabia, or the Soudan,, the same remark applies. In other words, the G.O..C. in Egypt will be the pivot of a much bigger organisation than Egypt itself. The i Imperial. force must therefore be adequate for this purpose, or must have the1 requisite power of expansion without undue delay. The question thus arises whether the reduction of the proposed force to relatively small numbers and its confinement to a single station will enable it satisfactorily to discharge these varied responsibilities. , ,. -1Lord Allenby, at the Foreign Office meeting, quoted, with agreement, the opinion of General Congreve, the present G.O.C., Egypt, that the minimum force required will be two brigades of infantry, two regiments of cavalry and a fleet of light cars everywhere, and he thought that it would be necessary to have:troops at the majority of the following places: Cairo, Alexandria, the Canal (&apos;i.e., Port Said, Kantara, Suez). He pointed out that, with the British force entirely removed to the Canal zone, the Egyptians would have the Sweet Water Canal in their hands, and could cut off the water supply of the British force altogether. For himself, if there was to be a single British camp, he would prefer that it should be at Cairo, where great barracks (Abbasieh and Kasr-el-Nil). are already in existence. In any case he could not contemplate Cairo and Alexandria totally denuded of British troops.We cannot indeed altogether exclude the possibility of conditions under which such a force might be found essential. Let us suppose a fanatical or racial rising in Cairo, directed, not necessarily against the British, but against Europeans or Christians as such,.or against the nationals of one of those foreign countries to whom we are to offer certain guarantees ; let us even conceive an attack upon the British Residency or upon the High Commissioner at a time of excited feeling. In such a contingency the native army, even if it were partially officered by Englishmen, might prove unreliable. Telegraphic communications with the British camp at Ismailia would be instantly Cut&apos; and the rails would be torn up. A very valuable and steadying influence might be exercised at such a moment by a small force in or outside the capital. I leave this case, however, if real importance is to be attached to it,, to be dealt with by our military advisers. ,,. . . . .Lord Milner,has explained in his reply to Mr. Churchill the reasons for the military recommendations of himself, and his colleagues, and their extreme desire-which is the foundation of this part of the Treaty to avoid all appearance of a garrison, and: to take no step inconsistent with the. conception of. Egypt as an independent State.Making full allowances, for this, I cannot see why it should be impossible,.or even difficulty if the necessity be established, to.provide in the initial stage and for a limited period for a British force of limited number, to. be placed both at Cairo and at Alexandria. It would be. a guarantee that- the new system was started under, conditions, oitranquillity and order., After:a fixed period- say, three years^-the decision might be open to,revision in the light of experience, and it might, then be possible to dispense with all British troops save at the Imperial station. &apos;.    . ..........I suggested at the Foreign, Office meeting that,, if the Imperial force, whether in peace or war, is to ,have full control of the means of communication essential to, its purpose, there must be a definite liaison between it and that branch of the Egyptian^ Administration which will control harbours, railways, post office, telegraphs, and-telephones. ........ .   &apos; .[4551 cj - B 2
It would be an&apos; absurd position if at a time of crisis the British G.O.C. found himself deprived of the mechanical means by which alone he could act with efficiency.There is one military duty in Egypt which it was generally agreed that the British must continue to perform. This is the Frontier Districts Administration, as it now exists in the Eastern and Western deserts and in the Sinai Peninsula. It is alluded to on p. 8 of Lord Milner&apos;s earlier Report. The force is a native one consisting of 1 infantry battalion, 2 camel-corps companies, and 30-40 cars. It is paid for by Egypt, but it is under British officers and British control. This arrangement must doubtless continue.The Egyptian Army.This is not mentioned either in Lord Milnersfirst Report or in thelatermemorandum, although its continued existence is clearly postulated, since upon it will depend (apart from the police) the maintenance of law and order in Egypt, and in the first resort the defence of the country. At the present time this army apart from its Egyptian officers is officered by Englishmen, and its Sirdar, who is also Governor-General of the Soudan-an arrangement that will obviously come to an end-is an Englishman. It! also supplies and pays for the military forces of the Soudan, even when these are recruited in that country. Lord Milner&apos;s first Report contemplates, and rightly contemplates, the withdrawal of the Egyptian army as soon as may be from the Soudan. This is one of the questions that will call for careful handling when we come to the question of the Soudan.As regards the Egyptian army itself, to whose numerical strength it is proposed to place no limit, this might be thought a danger were military science popular in Egypt or were the Egyptians a martial people. Neither proposition, fortunately, is true ; and the only conditions in which the native army might become a source of danger would presumably be if it were officered or commanded by foreigners other than Englishmen. This must be absolutely prohibited. Whether it is necessary or not that the Sirdar should be, as now, an Englishman I cannot say. Perhaps not a native figure-head might be innocuous. But that the force should have European officers, if it is to be of the slightest use and if it is to save the British Imperial force from being repeatedly called in to perform the duties for which it is incompetent, seems to me clear. It remains for discussion wdiether this should be effected by an agreement that the European officers should continue to be British (possibly in a proportion to be fixed) or by a stipulation that if and when foreign officers are required, they should not be drawn from any other country. A similar condition should probably apply to the police. We cannot afford to have a reproduction in Egypt of the experiment of which Persia in the last century has provided so many melancholy illustrations, namely, an army and a gendarmerie officered at different periods from various foreign States, whose&apos;subjects imported into the Persian service the international jealousies and rivalries of Europe. The Egyptian town police, which is now officered by Englishmen, is more important than the country police, and the Egyptian Government would probably be willing to come to an arrangement by which the existing system should continue.The British High Commissioner.I am somewhat troubled as to the future position of this high official. As contemplated in the earlier Report, he was &quot;to remain in charge of the foreign relations of Egypt&quot;-a subject to which I shall presently revert. Under the later Rcheme he is only to enjoy the somewhat shadowy authority whichlhave already described. He is to have titular precedence over all other foreign representatives, but his position as the defender of their rights-as previously enjoyed under the Capitulations-seems to me likely to expose him on the one hand to a good dealof unpleasant responsibility-if, as is more than likely, the foreign representatives, whenever they -cannot obtain redress from an inefficient native Government, turn to him for relief-? and on the other hand to equally unpleasant odium and abuse if he is not able to give them satisfaction. T think that the degree of his responsibility for the protection of the rights of foreigners in Egypt in the future will need to be very carefully defined, otherwise the responsibility itself will be a source of friction and danger. The reverse situation may be not less disagreeable- Supposing the foreign, representatives to ignore the High Commissioner altogether and to endeavour to settle their disputes with the Egyptian Government by independent action, by threats, or even by hostilities, would not his position be a very difficult One ? The principle upon which our policy in Egypt has been regulated ever since the days of Lord Palmerston if we except the
period of the shadowy condominium with France has been that we will not admit the interference of any foreign Power&apos;in Egypt. I suppose that this principle is still to be maintained.. Lord Milner and his colleagues clearly foresaw in the first instance the nature of the responsibility which the devolution upon the High Commissioner of the protection of foreign interests must entail. For in their earlier Report they wrote that &quot; this responsibility involves a certain degree of control orer the Egyptian Departments charged with the conduct of finance and with the maintenance of justice and public security, and will probably be found to involve the retention of at least two British advisers with their staffs, in the Egyptian service, who must continue to be nominated by the British Government, and the extent of whose authority should be clearly defined.&quot; But in the second memorandum, after the Conference with  aghloul Pasha and his friends, these conditions would appear to have been decidedly whittled down. These two all-important officials are, it is true, to be appointed by the Egyptian Government &quot; with the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; but the Financial Adviser who is ultimately to replace the present Commissioners of the Debt is only to &quot; be at the disposal of the Egyptian Government for all other matters on which they may desire to consult him &quot; a conceivably restricted sphere while the Judicial Adviser is only to &quot; be kept fully informed on all matters connected with the administration of the law as affecting foreigners, and will also be at the disposal of the Egyptian Government for consultation on any matter connected with the efficient maintenance of law and order.&quot; It is further significant that at the meeting of the members of the old Egyptian Legislative Council which has given a general support to Lord Milner&apos;s later proposals, the reservation found unanimous approval that the clauses giving to the Egyptian Government the option of consulting these officials should be eliminated. It appears to me that if these officials are to operate either as an effective administrative safeguard or as aliaison between the High Commissioner and the Egyptian Government their functions will need the more careful definition postulated in Lord Milners earlier Report.Let me say, before I leave the subject, that such influence as they are able or are permitted to exercise, will depend to a very large extent on their ability to speak French. That is the language in which the business of the Egyptian Government and the meetings of the Cabinet are conducted, and if they, are unable to speak it with ease, their influence will be small.I am also left in some doubt as to the position of the High Commissioner, vis-a-vis the Egyptian Government. He is clearly intended by Lord Milner and his colleagues to retain a quite exceptional position in the country. But I am not equally clear upon what sanction (other than that of personal influence and moral prestige) this will rest. If there are flagrant abuses in the Administration, if the British officials remaining in Egyptian employ have to complain of outrageous treatment, if the Egyptian Government deliberately ignores the High Commissioners advice, what exactly is to be done ? I could quote plenty of instances in the history of Eastern countries where the representative of a Great Western Power, whether Great Britain, Russia, or France, has been placed in a position of veiled superiority over a native Government to which were conceded the forms of a purely nominal independence. But I know of none in which that position has been maintained in face of an independence which was not nominal but real, and of foreign representatives who were technically equal and. in some cases, none too friendly. It is, of course, easy to say that if the High Commissioner is flouted or the superior position of Great Britain ignored,3the treaty can be cancelled and we shall go back again to the Protectorate, and there are already some cynical spirits who contend that this is the insidious object of Great Britain in making the present proposals. But such threats are more readily made than carried out; and I imagine that our real object is to conclude an arrangement that will endure. I think, therefore, that we should devote special attention to the position of the High Commissioner.*&apos;;.!&apos;.&quot;; Foreign Relations.,   .   ,I have pointed out that in his original Report Lord Milner proposed that the High Commissioner &quot;should.remain in charge of the foreign relations of Egypt in.so far as they are of a political character,&quot; but that, in deference to the opposition of Zaghloul Pasha and his. friends,. who, I believe, were insistent on the point, this has been abandoned in favour of the complete surrender to- Egypt of the control of her foreign relations, including the appointment of foreign Ministers abroad.   I cannot conceal
front; (my colleagues,-that I view this proposal with/considerable anxiety, and that I wpuldt&apos; greatly - preler j any arrangement; that ; would offer greater safeguards. for the future. 1 &apos; ;v; ; &apos; &apos;&apos;.&apos;   The situation must be looked: at (a) in its external and (h) in its internal aspect.. (a.&apos;)&apos; &quot;there&quot; will,, as&quot; contemplated in Lord Milner&apos;s first Report, be an Egyptian Minister or lligh Commissioner with an Egyptian Legation in London (to be followed presently,11 suppose, by an Afghan Legation, an Arab Legation, and I dare say a good, many&apos;more)&apos;; and there will be Egyptian Ministers at the majority of the foreign capitals. &quot;Their good faith and loyalty to the British connection are to be maintained by;&apos;fhe&quot;&quot;stipulation that &quot;Egypt will undertake not to adopt in foreign countries an. attitude which is inconsistent with the Alliance or will create difficulties for.Great Britain, and&apos;will also undertake not to enter into any agreement with a foreign Power, which is prejudicial ,to British interests.&quot; This language, particularly the first sentence, is very vague, and within its ambit it is not difficult to conceive of intrigues at Paris and Rome which might be very prejudicial to British interests. To anyone familiar either with the history of French diplomacy towards Egypt or with the present tortuous proceedings of Italian policy in the East, it will&apos; not. be difficult to imagine conditions which would hover continually on the line between good faith and bad faith, and might cause us much trouble. The only answer given to me is that we ndust&apos;&apos;trust,&apos;and that if the Egyptian Government had unofficial instead of official representatives&apos; at foreign capitals they would probably intrigue much more.&apos; (&amp;&apos;.) I confess that I view with greater anxiety the possible position at Cairo. In 1904 Lord Lansdowne, by his agreement with the French, purchased the French acceptance of our superior position in Egypt by a corresponding recognition of. the French Protectorate and abandonment of our own claims in Morocco. France retains and is&apos;daily extending and consolidating the position thus conceded to her in Morocco, and is&apos;making it an excuse for being exceedingly disagreeable, to us both about the Egyptian clauses of the Turkish Treaty, to which her assent is required, and about Tangier. Are we perhaps paving the way by which she may redeem the, as she thinks, disastrous error that she committed in Egypt when she abdicated her share in the condominium over thirty years ago, and are we creating the opportunity for-one more source of discord between her and Great Britain ? The&apos;Anglo-Persian Agreement,; which conceded to Great Britain in Persia a position somewhat analogous to that which it is proposed that we should occupy in Egypt, has not prevented France from intriguing against us, and,putting every conceivable obstacle in our path at Tehran, In Egypt she already retains the great advantages of the French language, French judges arid judicial procedure, and French schools. She will be dealing there in future&apos; with an independent sovereign State. May she not be tempted at times of friction&apos;or strained relations to use the first opportunity provided for her of twisting the Lion&apos;s tail ? May she not even revive her dreams.of a North African sphere of French influence from the Atlantic Ocean to tile Suez Canal? Even if the Quai d&apos;Orsay be innocent of any such deliberate intention, may not extreme nationalist elements in Egypt, which will not be suppressed by the proposed treaty, but will probably gather fresh strength as time goes on, intrigue with the French in Egypt as, their most natural anti-British ally ?, So long as we were both the, protecting and the occupying Power in Egypt we could deal sharply with such pretensions. We shall in future lack the local power, while not escaping the responsibility.The only guarantee that I can think of, supposing Lord Milner&apos;s proposals to be accepted, for rendering the position less dangerous than it might otherwise become, is a categorical undertaking that the Egyptian Government shall not appoint foreign officials to any branch-or at least any important branch-of the Administration without the consent of the High Commissioner. It may be said that, once the British; Protectorate has disappeared, our relations with the Egyptian Government.will be so cordial that no danger of foreign intrigue will survive, and that they will regard us. as a natural buffer against the meddlesomeness of other foreign Powers. This is an excellent theory. But I have too much experience of the zest with which Oriental Governments fish in troubled waters, if there is the slightest chance of extracting some profit from the operation, to be at all confident that it will always be acted upon.The British Services.I am in general agreement -with. Lord Milner&apos;s. proposals as to future, appointments to the Egyptian service and as to the retirement, whether voluntary or compulsory,.of the present British staih , I do not doubt that the Egyptian Govern-
merit, unless they are swayed by some violent gust of anti-foreign feeling; will desire to retain a considerable number of these, and will propose equitable terms for the remainder.,1 What we have more ,to fear is that the British officials may stampede-in large numbers-4-a course which we should do all in our power to dissuade.In his earlier Report Lord Milner proposed a period of five years, within which the fate of the present British staff should be decided. In his memorandum this is cut down to two years. Might it not be desirable to fix&apos; a minimum of two years and a maximum of five in order to prevent any undue dislocation ? *      1    1.-:.-v:;i.    &apos;&apos; r*    . Trade. &quot;&quot;&apos;.-&apos; &apos; &apos;       ;       1      J-: ^Egypt is to enjoy complete freedom in her commercial relations with foreign countries, i.e., she. may conclude Tariff Treaties. There must of course b^ most-favoured-nation treatment for British trade. &apos; -Finance.This is barely mentioned in the papers submitted. Egypt must, as I have argued, continue to bear the expense of the Frontier Districts Administration. To her Soudan contribution I will come in a moment. She is not, I understand, to be asked for. any contribution to the High Commissioners office, even though a portion of his services will be rendered to the Egyptian Government. This is probably right. Nor, I gather, is--, she&apos;to make any contribution towards the British Imperial force, even though there is a contingent claim upon this force for Egyptian purposes. In the event of the British army being called upon to assist in the defence of the Egyptian frontiers, or the suppression of internal revolt, I imagine that a special case would arise.The Soudan.This is not mentioned in the memorandum; but it occupies three pages of the earlier Report. It cannot be omitted from the Treaty because (1) the Egyptians will insist upon its inclusion ; (2) Egyptian finances are involved ; (3) it is equally to our interest to settle its future by agreement with the Egyptian Government. Egypt&apos;s interest in the Soudan, as has been pointed out by Lord Milner, is fourfold. Her life depends on the water which flows down from or through the Soudan. The Soudan Civil Service is still largely filled by Egyptians. The Soudanese army is a part of the Egyptian army and is paid for by Egypt. Ever since the Cromer Agreement of 1899 Egypt has been called upon to pay for the deficit in the Soudanese budget.Lord Milner does not propose the abrogation of the latter agreement. On the contrary, he proposes its continuance. But we shall have difficulty in maintaining a a position in which, while Egyptian participation both in the Civil Service and in the Army is expected to dwindle rapidh and as soon as possible disappear, Egyptian revenues are to continue, for some time at&apos; any rate, to bear a considerable charge. The answer, I suppose, will be that Egypt must continue to pay for the water that she enjoys, having, of course, a seat on the permanent Board of Control, and that a part of the price which she must pay for the withdrawal of the British garrison from Egypt is the withdrawal of the Egyptian garrison from the Soudan. The complete political and military independence of the Soudan is in any case the ulterior object which British interests demand. &apos;  ..General Considerations.The remarks which I have made in this paper must not be held to detract from the thanks which we all owe to Lord Milner and his colleagues for their immense and self-sacrificing labours in the solution of the Egyptian problem. They have rendered a great national and Imperial service. Nor do I dissent either from Lord Milner&apos;s main proposition that the solution is to be found in a treaty of alliance between Great Britain and the Egyptian Government, or,from the major premiss on which that principle is founded, namely, that if we are to advance, it must be a large advance in the direction not merely of co-operation but of trust.Lord Milner&apos;s own defence of his proposals will, I think, be that they are in the \ nature of a gamble in which we stake a good deal on the chance that the Egyptians will be willing to work his projected constitution with loyalty, while if they fail we shall always be in a position to go back.
It has been my object to elucidate those aspects of his proposal which seem to me to be fraught either with obscurity or with danger; so that we may by careful examination remedy the one and avoid the other. That study the various Departments of our Government who are concerned will, I am sure, give without delay.Procedure,So far the only Egyptians committed have been Zaghloul Pasha and his associates, Adly Pasha, and a few others who came over to England in a private capacity to give their views. In Egypt there has been the general discussion of the proposals as outlined in the press, to which I have already referred. The fellaheen, who are vitally affected, have not so far given any sign. We are, however, under a pledge given by Lord Allenby to the Sultan of Egypt that he shall appoint a formal and official deputation, representing different important parties and elements in the Egyptian community, to discuss the projected arrangement with His Majesty&apos;s Government.I suggest that when His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided upon the general outlines of the scheme which they propose to offer, Lord Allenby on his return to Egypt, which I have asked him to postpone for a fortnight, in order that the decision may be taken while he is here, should invite the Sultan to appoint and to despatch this delegation to England, in order to draw up the actual terms of the treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government.Should we come to an agreement, the text will then be taken back to Egypt and submitted to a National Assembly in the course of the forthcoming spring. We can hardly expect an earlier solution.C. or KForeign Office, October 11, 1920.
