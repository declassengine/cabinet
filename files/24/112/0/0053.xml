Demerit, so *!Ye property tf^ *His 3.-;- ,&apos;viajej:y&apos;a Government,$1 9:5 3    ) JjmELBSS TELEGRAPHY MB VISUAL SIGNALLING- BILL 19ft.This Bill amends the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904 which empowers the Postmaster General to control wireless telegraph installations in. the United Kingdom.   Such control is necessary in order to prevent improper use of wireless in time of peace and to enable the State to close private stations promptly in tiiao of emergency.Pre-war experience had shown that the position of the Government in regard to the grant of licences for wireless experiments required strengthening, and the matter was referred to an inter-Depart mental Committee.  The Bill embodies the recommendations of the Committee,With the extended use of wireless telegraphy and telephony, the risk of interference, unless the installations are under proper control, has become greater;  and all countries have found that such control is necessary if wireless is to achieve its proper functions.It is not intended to withhold from the public any of the advantages of wireless communication;  and full scope is left to inventive genius by allowing the erection of experimental stations in proper hands.   Permission is, and will be, readily given for reoelvjn&amp; stations;  and transmitting stations of small power will be allowed with practically equal freedom when the applicants can show that they are serious students of wireless, and where there is no risk of interference with Government or commercial stations in the immediate locality; but applications for the use of larger power at transmitting stations will have to he more carefully scrutinised than &quot;before the war. The main points in the Bill are:-
1.  Removal of obligation to grant exnsriaental licenceswithout rent or royally;7The 1904 Act provides that the Postmaster General, when satisfied that a licence is required solely for experiments, shall grant the licence and shall charge no rent or royalty.  It is considered that ho should have power to refuse a licence, for example to a foreigner or to a person otherwise unsuitable, and also that ho should have power to make an. annual charge in respect of experimental licences, in order to meet the expense of issuing the licence and of periodically inspecting the station. The Bill accordingly provides (Section 5) for the repeal of the relative part of the Act.11.  Power to. &quot;make regulations.Section 2 of the Bill empowers the Postmaster General to mako regulations as to the issue of licences and operators1 certificates and the 6bservan.ce of the International Wireless Convention and Regulations.   These points, and also those dealt with in Section 4 of the Bill, have to some extent been met previously by clauses in the licences, but it is desired to give the rules a statutory sanction which will enable bad cases of infringement to be dealt with more strictly than by a mere   , withdrawal of the licence *The provision in Section 2, 1 (c) as to prevention of interference with wireless telegraphy by the generation or use of electric waves for other purposes, will not affect power plants or railways or other installations which transmit power by wire, It is directed against the use of Hertsian waves for non-telegraphic purposes where this would cause interference with Government or Commercial wireless telegraphy.111 *  Application to Aircraft.   (Section 6 of the Bill).It is proposed that when wireless is used in aircraft a &apos;licence
liconco from the Post Office must be held and the Operator must be certificated. The object is to ensure a proper standard of equipment and operating.   The Air Ministry considers this provision essent ial.IV. Application to Visual Signalling from the shoreto ships at sea (Section 7).The Admiralty consider it necessary, in order to facilitate the closing down of visual signalling stations in time of eiaergency, that all stations (except Lloyds) established for the purpose of signalling from the shore to ships at sea should be licensed.  The section was drawn up in consultation between the Admiralty and Board of Trade.V. Control in Emergency.During the war, control of the possession, transfer and use of apparatus was obtained by Regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act.  It is proposed (Section 8 of the Bill) to give the Postmaster General power to take similar control in case of emergency and so to avoid the delay which might be entailed, in a sudden emergency * in obtaining the necessary legislative authority.VI. Increase of Penalties...The increase of the maximum penalties on summary conviction (Section 5) was recommended by the Inter Departmental Committee in order to facilitate settlement of the cases by summary procedure.(Sgd.)
