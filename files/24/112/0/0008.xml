The conference with employers has broken down upon the &quot;datum line&quot; for wages, but, apart from this, the South Wales and Lancashire miners seem deter-mined to come out unless they receive the extra 2s. at once; the former because they are &quot;spoiling for a fight&quot; and the latter because their wages compare unfavourably with those of the cotton-spinners.   Even if a strike does take place, it is doubtful whether the other member? of the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; will join it.fOn the basis of the sliding scale the National Union of Railwaymen made application yesterday for an increase of 2s. for all men in the conciliation grades.The most serious factor at the moment is the steady growth of unemployment; the men affected are a prey to agitators and the ex-Service men are in an ugly mood.   Many business firms both large and small are on the verge of collapse and everything points to a very difficult situation during the winter.   It is impossible to doubt that the revolutionary movement will gain strength.Lenin has charged Hies Sylvia Pankhurat with the task of amalgamating all the British Communist parties.   He could soarcely have made a worse choice.The British pilgrims who are straggling back from Mosoow appear to be disillusioned, to have no taste for Lenin&apos;s &quot;iron discipline&quot; and to doubt his infallibility.The/
$he Agenda Press, which prints Sylvia PankhursVs effusions, has been seized by the brokers; Bhe had managed, however, to borrow sufficient money to pay them off for the moment,   She is expecting considerable sums from Russia,IU Longuet is addressing meetings under the. auspices of the Independent Labour Party; his speech in London was a depressing record of the failure of international socialism.The increase of fares in the Metropolitan area is causing great dissatisfaction.Confirmation of the intrigues between Litvlnoff and the Sinn Feiners has now been received.
.,m.coal ..MIHElRS&quot; &quot; *..........*....... &apos;The BxtBpBimJbon^o^^ -as Xt wasreceived by all classes, including Trade Unionists, has disappointed the revolutionaries because they regarded the coal strike as the first step towards their goal.The conference with the Coal Owners having broken down on the &quot;Datum line&quot;, we are now face to face with a hew crisis.    The South Wales delegates have instructions to withdraw from the*conference if the &quot;Datum line&quot; is discussed.    There appears to be a general feeling among the miners that output is restricted by shortage of tubs and by bad roads, rather than by slack work.There have been stormy scenes between the partners in the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; and even between the Miners themselves $he volte face -of;Mr. Smillie is still unexplained, but it is predicted that he will be out of the movement in three months and that Mr. Hodges will succeed him.    Ifir. Smillie is an incorruptible fanatic, while Hodges is reputed to be -even amongst his friends - an opportunist.Peeling in the ooal fields is sharply.divided. Yorkshire and the Midlands never desired a strike and were pleased with the turn of events; my Yorkshire correspondent reports that much of the furniture which was pawned during the strike last year has not yet been redeemed.    In South Wales and Lancashire the feeling-is very different:   in both there is a determination to have the 2/- at once, but whereas in South Wales a reckless desire for a &quot;row&quot; is tne motive, in Lancashire it is the high wages earned by the &quot;^extUes^-in-^omparieon with, the miners.    It seems likely, therefore, that we must be prepared for sectional strikes in South Wales and Lancashire next week.    At present the indignation which finds voice in resolutions passed at meetings in all parts of South Wales is direoted against the leaders, who *are regarded as having &quot;let them down11.In/
-   **In Northumberland the majority support tho action^ the Federation in spite of the clamour of the extremists, One Durham pit, it is true, has passed a resolution condemning the leaders..The Scottish miners are solidly.in favour pf increas wagos ana declare that whatever may he the outcome of the negotiations Lanark will not &quot;be bound by the result. In this area there is talk of seizing the mines, the &quot;Social advising the men to &quot;Take and hold;,&apos;,,Tell the masters an$ the Government that you will discuss terms in six months, You are going to prove to the world that Labour can control,.,The Army will support you,,.?/hy should you go 01 strike and starve? Such methods are the act of slaves. Play the man in this fight and if it should be called for MM FORCE BY FORCE,&quot;On the whole, the firm attitude of the Government has had a great effect on the rainens, who are amazed that the! threats did not secure immediate concessions,    They do not seem to understand tb$ &quot;Datum line&quot; and one remarked -presumably in connection with the X Y Z formula - &quot;I don&apos;t know whether it is noughts and crosses or shove ha*penny -. I am fed right :up.&quot;    dn the whole it seems not unlikely that the, strike notices will be extended for a further period, but it is doubtful if this step would preclude sectional action in South Wales and Lancashire,If a strike takes place, there is not at present any reason to believe that it will involve the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot;,* &apos; .     ,     .    -UMPLogmr&apos;fThe steady increase in the Xiumber of unemployed is becoming very serious,.-.* Scarcely a trade is unaffected. Many mills in Lancashire are closed temporarily.    AtBurnley/
Burnley 40,000 looms are stopped and wages reduced; some operatives1 are not earning more than half their usual wages.   Daring the past week unemployment throughout Lancashire and Cheshire is said to have increased by 2,500.   The engineering trade has riot yet recovered from the effect of the mouldersT strike and there is still a shortage of castings, which throws out engineers for days at a time.   The strike of shipwrights at Liverpool has thrown a large number out of employment and work at the docks is slack.Marches of the unemployed are frequent and although they are often made up of men who do not want to work, the Communist Parties are gaining many recruits, while the meetings of patriotic Societies, are continually being broken up.   I have received specimens of the kind of speeches delivered by Communist agitators.   They are all directed towards exciting class hatred.   &quot;When,&quot; they say, &quot;are you going to begin?   This is going to be a black and terrible winter for the workers; millions now working will be thrown out of work.   You will be forced to take action before long, or starve.   Why wait?   Why not begin now? Use the power that is in your hands,&quot; etc, etcIn a similar speech delivered by James Stewart at Birmingham on September &apos;26th, the workers were urged to t revolt on &quot;the ground of &quot;the tardiness of reopening trade H    -with Russia, which would relieve unemployment and all the other ills from which the workers are suffering.gggLjjKx AMONG EX-SEHYICB MEN,Meetings have been held in London during the week, and although the audiences are small the temper of the men is becoming more bitter.   They allege that the persons who heckle their speakers have been sent by&quot;John/t
4x&quot;John Bull&quot; to break up the meetings.Unemployment among ex-Service men in Leicester is 4 increasing and they are reported to be in a very ugly mood and &quot;almost out of hand&quot;.The demand for some sort of national work is increasing; the men claim that it is useless to rely on the patriotism of employers and that the Government should at once start schemes for road-mending, afforestation and improvement of water ways.   There is much talk of agitati: for an increase of War gratuities by 50 per cent.The balance sheet of the International Union of Six-Service Men for the period from May 1st - August 31st shows a deficit of  21. 14s. &amp;d.W COMMUNIST parties the revolutionaries who have straggled back from Russia during the past few weeks are somewhat bedraggled and crestfallen.   Closer acquaintance with Lenin has not converted them all.   far example, John S. Clarke, who came back in a state of disillusionment with no more than  30 in his pocket, writing in &quot;The Worker&quot; of the 25th t 6aid that though he wcruld admit Lenin to be &quot;three-fourths rigil in his position, this is not by any means an admission the he is 100 per cent right......Lenin&apos;a error in supposing that British workers who take an interest in polities will be easily oonvorted to the new revolutionary tactics beoaij they are 5moro advanced&apos; than the masses of Russia&apos;, destroys a whole lot of hife case.&quot;1Apparently Lenin is a hard taskmaster who demands lr discipline and results for money spent. Both requirement^; are distasteful to the British type of revolutionary. S appears also that the Congress of the Third Internationaldealt/
dealt somewhat roughly with the British Communists and advised thorn to &quot;atop fooling&quot;.   W. McLaine had the honour of Biding with Lenin against Sylvia Pankhurat and W, Gallcoher.   Sylvia Pankhurst received more finiinoial support than her fallow suppliants, hut oven she had to agree to establish peaceful relations with thd othor Communist groups and to amalgamate with them.   It must have out her to the quick when Lenin stipulated thet the Chairman of the entire organisation must he a Russian.It is now reported that Sylvia Pankhurst wad George L&amp;lansbury are working together and. further, that the money which the former expects to receive from Russia is to be used as follows: 20 per week to be spent on obtaining the services! of a fir^t-clasc canvasser to increase the circulation of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;  5 per week for a sub-editor.  6 per week to an agitator for the dooks.  G per week to an agitator for the Army. 10 por week for the distribution of free literature. 1,500 to be set aside for the settling of the debts of the Agenda Press. 500 for the needs of the Workers1 Socialist Federation, 200 for the People1i Russian Information Bureau, (152, Fleet Street). 250 to go towards settling the debts of thePeople&apos;s Russian Information Bureau, and 15 por week allowed for the staff payments.In the current issue of the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; shewrites that &quot;the Executive of the Third International hascalled British Communists to convene another conference to formone Communist Party for Britain within four months of thereturn of the delegates from Moscow.&quot;On September 25th and 26th.the secret conference attoChester/
Manchester tried to follow Lenin&apos;s instructions by resolving on the foundation of one all-embracing Communist Party for Britain on the definition laid down by the Third International, and the air is sow filled vdth rumours of Conferences.   This need not disturb us over much for no one has yet ever succeeded in tricing amicably with Sylvia Pankhurst, and her paper is now to be controlled by a committee of three. Whitohoad and Watkins having bees elected ass her colleagues.   Miss P&amp;nkhurst thoroughly enjoya the atmosphere of conspiracy.   She is already talking of &quot;shadow&quot; secretaries, organisers and executive committees to provide against Government raids.   Literature is to be left at parcel offices to be called for, and the books are to be kept by the &quot;shadow&quot;, who will hand them to another &quot;shadow&quot;, whose identity will be unknown even to the secretary.   Agents are to be put into   Government Departments and public offices, into the Army, the Poet Office, the Telegraph Service, the Wireless Stations and newspaper offices.   An alliance is to be formed with the International Union of ex-Servioe Men, the Young Socialist League and tho Shop Stewards.The refusal of the Labour Party to accept the affiliation of the Communist Party has been disconcerting, for part of the plan wau to enter the Labour Party ar.d smash it from within. The quarrel is now spreading to the local branches and Communists are being urged to refuse to obey the Executive whenever they find themselves in a majority in the local Labour Parties.   In Manchester wordy warfare is being waged. The revolutionary, Matthews, stated on September 26th that Sylvia Pankhurst had received  10,000 frem the Government for propaganda purposes.   She is also accused of acting as a spy for Scotland House.
My Yorkshire correspondent reports great friction between the Communists and the Independent Labour Party In his dictriot and there is a talk of Communists opposing the Labour Parliamentary and Municipal candidates.James Stewart haw informed the Coventry Communist Party that a courier is to be sent to Russia te ask for the whole or part of the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;s&quot;  75,000.   During an open air debate between Stewart and a member of the Industrial Christian Fellowship on September 23rd, my correspondent heard working men asking why such speakers were allowed to be at large.The trend of the wind may be judged from the revolutionary eper-kers who have recently stated that although they approve of the Soviet system they do not advocate i s application to this country.&quot;British industrialists will have to work out their own policy without regard to Moscow ........The difference between conditions in this highly organised, industrially centralised, politically oompaot and insular country, and the mediaeval, semi-barbaric, loosely organised and politically infantile Russia ie almost inconceivable to those who have not been there to aee.&quot;THE &quot;RED ARM&quot; IN scotland the Moscow Government/which it always anxious to believe that a revolution is beginning in Great Britain, has issued a wireless to the effect that Scotland has a &quot;Red Guard&quot; of 60,000 armed men and that a oenmunlst rising is imminent.My Glasgow correspondent reports, however, that although a flumber of extremists eoncider that they aro members of a &quot;Red&quot; party, the organisation is still embryonic, end that they are shy of any definite steps, in spite of John MacLean&apos;s hints.   The origin of the Mosoow report is doubtless the boast of McDougull that he had a Red Array at Blantyre, which would seise the coal mines.SYNDICALIST/
machinery/SYNDICALIST PLANS gInformation haa ,1ust reached me that the employees of the J.A.P. Motor Works, Tottenham, are arranging to seize the factory and run it on their own lines on the Italian model.   Owing to shortage of work, the factory is to be closed on Friday, October 1st till Monday. October 11th, when it will re-open, and it is on Friday that seizure is meditated.   Precautions have been taken and it is unlikely that any disorder will occur, but the incident is symptomatic of the general unrest,REVOLUTIONARY PROPAGANDA FOR CHILDRENMovements such as the Young Socialist League have been in existence for some time, as was exemplified in the London May Day demonstration and there appears to be a recrudescence of activity in the Socialist Sunday Schools. The Sunday meeting of the Battersea School was attended by about 80 ohildren who replied &quot;Yes Comrade&quot; when the registei was called and recited the Socialist Commandments,The ohildren have a special socialist hymn book and are generally imbued with revolutionary ideas.Rothstein has subsidized the Young Socialist league and much of the literature is written to appeal, to boys and girls,THE COUNCILS OF action as the imaginary danger of oonscription recedes, the uselessness of the National Council of Action seems to be affecting the workers generally; they are losing interest in the local councils.   In Birmingham, for instance, an audienc of only 300 assembled to hear A.A. Purcell, Arthur MacManus and James Stewart, and was roundly abused for lethargy.The extremists are nevertheless working to perfect the
machinery offered by the council system; in Crayford arrangements were reported to have been made for the seizure of all allotment crops in the event of a miners&apos; strike, and for their &quot;equal&quot; division.In Dover a local oouncil has been formed, with the object of organising and directing all Labour bodies as to their action during a strike.THE&quot; LABOUR RESEARCH department the Annual Report of the Labour Research Bureau states that the number of affiliations has   risen from 423 to 830, the membership from 640 to 653 and the associates from 189 to 210.   The assistance of the department has been given in many important Labour crises and it is extending its publications; the formation of a Labour publishing company is under consideration.The loss on the year&apos;s working, however, will amount to about  1,000 and the report points out that Labour will have to pay for the worlc If it is worth doing.The report goes on to deal with the Labour News Service, which has been accused of &quot;blaok-legging&quot; journalists by the distribution of news.   To this charge it replies by stating that&apos;no&apos;labour news is given in the papers, or if it is the news is false; the Labour News Service is to be at the disposal of any accredited newspaper correspondent as soon as a Labour column is regarded as indispensable in a popular newspaper.COMMANDER GRENFELL    .       - ... A,  ;::On September 23rd Commander Grenfell addressed a meeting of the Holbom Labour Party&quot; in Essex Hall.  He protested against the policy of the British Government in the Middle and
Far East and said that as a result of his experience in Embassies abroad during the war he had been in a position to observe the intrigues and diabolical plans of British and French diplomats.   He condemned the policy of the Government in Ireland, Mesopotamia and Persia and said that the oilfields of the two Eastern oountries were being exploited by British finance,(PHIS &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;Trade Union circles are still much agitated by the exposure of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; finances and some of the pro-Russian leaders are endeavouring to whitewash the paper. Mr. Ben Turner,&apos; addressing Yorkshire meetings, stated that the charges are a fabrication and has offered to give  100 to a local hospital if any of them can be proved.The line taken by Mr. fiobert Williams, Mr. Hamsay Macdonald and others is that if the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; had aocepted a Russian subsidy it would be no worse than &quot;The Times&quot; or other papers that accepted foreign subsidies for special supplements.A great number of the rank and file, however, take a different view and heckling on the subject is of frequent occurrence.   A speaker at East Ham, for instance, who advised his audience to read the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; provoked cries of &quot;Bolshie&quot;, &quot;Thatfs done it,&quot;   &quot;We don&apos;t want no truck with that lot.&quot;The First Debenture holders and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Trade Union Committee have resolved to appeal to the Labour and Co-operative movements to invest in the paper.Meanwhile the circulation has apparently fallen off.   In the Telegraph Room at the General Post Office all the copies of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; were found torn up on the morning of the disclosure, apparently by operators who had no sympathy with/
it with their Boci&amp;listio colleagues.   Enquiry at Nottingham book stall disclosed the fact that the daily circulation had fallen from 60 to 12 immediately after the disclosure. Mr, Lonsbury was in a somewhat chastened mood at . Leicester on September 19th; he said that the fundamental point on which he disagreed with Bolshevism, and those who believe in bloody revolution, was that goodness cannot be imposed from without, it must come from within.SINN ITS IN IN GREAT BRITAINMeetings of the Irish Self-Determination League have been held in Fulham, Balham, Tooting, Poplar and Forest Gate; concerts have also been held with the object of raising money for the North, Wall workers and the movement generally.On September 23rd some 350 clergy assembled to meetDr. Mannix at the Cannon Street Hotel.   Some extracts fromthe Archbishop!s speech may be of interests&quot;I am represented as a firebrand and one who is out to keep England and Ireland for ever apart,   I have rarely made a public speech and I made known in America, that I looked forward to the time when there would be peace between these two countries and peace between America and the rest of the World,   Those who act for England have been able to put upon me the indignity which you are here to redeem,   I say without fear there has been no loss of dignity unless it is on the part of the British Government.   The Government who is capable of treating me as I have been treated reflects no credit on the British Ens;ire and the sooner they are replaced by fresh politicians the better it will be for England and the Empire.   I make no complaints and I have only pity and contempt for those who still think they are serving their own country,or leading up to peace between England and Ireland,   I was opposed to consorip-tion in.....Australia, but so was Australia and. I have never been forgiven by those/who have it in their power to persecute me. . My other offence - I am  an Irishman - I oannot help that.   I make no apology end I am not going to. r     ti&quot;My message to Ireland. , I have none.   The people have more to tell me than I have to tell them,   I have been approached to make some pronouncements on the Irish question, but I d&amp;a1t mind telling you, I have no message to. Ireland and while I em detained in England, kept out of touch with those opinions I am pleased to share, I refuse to say anything on the Irish question from the Irishmanfs point of view,   I could say something to the English people.
- 18 -0 -   t&quot;I repeat I am not a hater of England or the English people.   These imaginary words and statements are believed by only those&apos; who moke them, but I refuse to shut my eyes to the outrages committed in Ireland      % under the flag of England.   I have no sympathy with the enmity between the two countries, and if I were an Englishman X should approach it from a different question.&quot;I was an Irishman before I was an Archbishop and I remain an Irishman although I am an Archbishop.&quot;Demonstrations of Sinn Peiners and of Orangemen havebeen held in Liverpool and feeling between the two factionsiB running high.   Oh September 26th Barrel! Figgis. &quot;IndustrialCommissioner of the Irish Republic&quot;, addressed a meeting ofsome 3,500 people in the Liverpool Stadium and related&quot;serious facts&quot; which he knew would endanger his liberty andmight place his life in jeopardy.   After giving the SinnFein version of various outrages Figgis charged the EnglishGovernment with being in collusion with robbers, with being in collusion with White Slavers, with releasing forgers andcriminals and with aiding murderers, and said that the handsof the Government were wet and red with deliberate murder.ireland in all 260 outrages were reported by the police, during the week; of these 823 were directly attributablo to Sinn Fein, only 3 were due to agrarian motives and 34 were miscellaneous crimes of a serious nature.   Five vacated Royal Irish Constabulary barracks-and; one coastguard station were burned down; there were 62 oases- of raiding for arms bf disguised and armed men and 56 cases of robbery of mail trains, cars and postmen, to obtain-money and official correspondence.   Six persons were kidnapped,   Bdyootting and intimidation for political motives were widespread.Ten members &quot;of &quot;the &quot;Royal ;trish &apos;-&apos;6c^BJ^i0fy^:,yi^p, murdered, while a number of others were seriously wbtihdid.; V, &quot; ^On September 22rid the1 ;ito$sK ^ri^^c&amp;ftt^Wa^. cirossley^ -*- &apos; : .,Tl &apos;    lorry/
-13- 58lorry from Ennistymon was ambushed between Miltown Malbay and Lahinch, Co. Clare,   There were 6 policemen in the car; four were shot dead instantly.   Sergeant Bynes was mortally wounded and one constable was missing.Belfast was comparatively quiet and arrangements had been concluded for the expelled shipyard workers to resume. This did not suit Sinn Fein plans and there is little doubt that renewed attackB on the police were designed with the object of promoting further disorder there.  -The Sinn Fein papers appeared as usual.   The current issue of &quot;Old Ireland&quot; is described as a new series.   It contains a &quot;Message to the World&quot; from the Lord Mayor of Cork ascribing his continued existence to divine intervention, and also an alleged intervie^with de Valera in which he appears to approve of the murder campaign, stating, &quot;We will strike when we can even if it has to come down to individuals.&quot;The railway position is unchanged and passenger traffic on some of the Western lines is almost at a standstill.It has been previously reported that the Soviet Authorities were endeavouring to get into touch with the Sinn Fein party to help them.   Interesting confirmatory evidence of this, and showing that even as far back as the beginning of 1918, this Intrigue was going on, has been brought to light through the papers seized in a raid on the house of William 0*Brian (Labour) at Dublin recently, when in a letter written by Sydney Arnold to William 0&apos;Brien the paragraph occurs;&quot;I am expecting a message from Litvinoff&quot;, This letter is dated February, 1918.A letter dated 83rd uarch, 1918, written by Litvinoff to0&apos;Brien says:-&quot;Dear Sir, I thank you for sending me your Council!s resolution, which I am having sent to Russia. With best wishes.&quot;It is quite clear from this that negotiations were putin/
in hand by Litvinoff as early aB the beginning of 1916. The matter is still one which is being urged by the Soviet Authorities.It will be remembered that Litvinoff was required to leave England in September, 1918.
