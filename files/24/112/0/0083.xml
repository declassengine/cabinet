y\\    &apos;   ( -This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.ri &apos;a p.o     V.THE CABINET.EMPLOYMENT AT WOOLWICH.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. I circulate correspondence between the Minister of Labour and myself.w. s. c.The War Office,ISth October, 1920.My dear Churchill, 7th October, 1920.You will remember that on the 13th May, Mr. Hope and I, at the request of -77    l^r- Bonar Law, submitted a Joint Memorandum^ to the Cabinet on the subject^ofdischarges at Woolwich, and that at the meeting &quot;of the Cabinet on the 19th May it n, \ was decided &quot; to approve the recommendation that Woolwich should be placed in a [-composition to act as sub-contractors to engineering firms, subject to Sir James Stevensonbeing satisfied that this could be done without the Government suffering financial lossthereby &quot;Since this decision Sir James Stevenson has, I understand, been exploring the possibilities of Woolwich in this direction thoroughly, and I have kept in touch with him partly because of the serious amount of unemployment with which we are faced at Woolwich, and partly because of my original commission in the matter. I saw Sir James Stevenson last week, and discussed the position with him. I gather that the present establishment at the Ordnance Factories is about 13,600, a reduction of about 1,500 having been effected during the past 4 months. At the same time there is a present shortage of orders to the value. of 600,000?., if the existing &apos; establishment is to be maintained, and that if these orders are not forthcoming to make up the deficiency, something over 1,350 employees must soon be discharged, including a number of ex-Service men. The value of the orders for alternative commercial work placed with Woolwich to date is almost negligible.The main difficulty appears to be over the application of the Cabinet ruling that financial loss is to be avoided. On a literal interpretation this means that each order must bear its full share of very heavy dead-weight charges, which include heavy machinery charges and the maintenance of idle capacity. In typical cases I am informed that non-productive expenditure, machinery charges, and indirect expenditure represent a charge of as much as 450 per cent, on the operators wage. It is clearly impossible to quote prices for alternative work on such a basis, and it appears absolutely necessary, if the policy of alternative work is to be successfully pursued, that prices should be quoted on the basis of direct labour costs, plus a maximum overhead charge of 150 per cent, to 175 per cent., the balance of the over-head charges being met by a special writing-off, or added to the cost of armament production.In the second place the policy laid down by the Cabinet that orders of Government Departments should be placed wherever possible with Woolwich, does not appear to be working very satisfactorily. I understand there is an increasing tendency for other Government Departments to place in other directions orders which Woolwich could undertake. It seems necessary, therefore, that further emphasis should be laid on this policy in order that it may become a recognized practice for all Government Depart-ments in the placing of orders to give preference to the Government Industrial Establishments.   Moreover, where Woolwich cannot undertake an order economically,(B20/42G)   100   10/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.  8630wo
then it seems desirable that before the order is placed with the Trade, the Director-General of Factories should be given &apos;au opportunity of obtaining in exchange from the firm concerned a commercial order for the execution of which Woolwich is adapted.The foregoing applies, of course, particularly to Woolwich, but I understand that there are cases where the national factories could be adapted to undertake commercial work at relatively small additional capital expenditure. An example, I believe, is the factory at Enfield, and in connection with this I should add that I have received representations from time to time as the effect upon employment of the curtailment of the work at Enfield.I understand that if alternative commercial work is to be satisfactorily carried out at Woolwich, there are also some questions of administrative reorganization which arises, but these, of course, are outside my province.On the main points I should be very grateful if you could give the position at Woolwich your very early and careful consideration. I am sure that, from the point of view of employment in the Woolwich area during the coming winter, such a consideration is only too well merited.Very faithfully yours,T. J. Macnamara.My dear Macnamara, 15th October, 1920.I have your letter of 7th October on the subject of employment at Woolwich, with which I am in complete agreement, and I am circulating this correspondence to the Cabinet in order that a decision may be reached.Yours very sincerely, * &apos;   Winston S. Churchill.
