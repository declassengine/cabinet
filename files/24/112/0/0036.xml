Copy of an Agreement between Sibunion and Krassin, which is in possession of the Department of Overseas Trade.The Department of the Overseas Trade, in a letter to the General Staff on the 23rd September, 1920, said that it is reported that none of the goods mentioned in the Agreement are fit for military stores, and they are mostly composed of shoddy.The letter stated that the textile officers of the department had been consulted, and reported that, judging by the price and weights, it is unlikely that any of the goods mentioned are of any standard quality of khaki cloth. The information was that considering some of the prices quoted they would show a very large profit.(b20/409)   100  10/20  h&amp;s, ltd.  8596wo
(6.) Messrs. Beck &amp; Co.The following is to be delivered within 6 months to the Russian Trade Delegation in London: Khaki cloth, value 600,O0OZ.   (Average cost per yard, 16s.) j million yards ; weight, 33 ozs. (heavy coating).100,000 yards; weight, 23/24 ozs. (for tunics and trousers).150,000 yards; weight, 17 ozs. (for riding breeches).Flannel for underwear, value 80,000/. Colours, various; regulation texture as used by the British Army.Needles and buttons, value 30,000/. Including 50,000 gross imitation khaki leather buttons.The goods, which are to be paid for in gold (coin or bar), have not yet been delivered. Messrs. Beck &amp; Co. consulted the Foreign Office before commencing negotiations. They are in addition supplying a quantity of cloth unsuitable for military purposes.Mr. Beck has been informed by the Department of the Overseas Trade that this contract   may&apos;-&apos; not be sanctioned,The information under this heading (6) has been obtained by a representative of this Directorate, who personally saw a representative of Messrs. Beck &amp; Co., who not only made no attempt to conceal the nature of the deal, but were convinced that the cloth was intended for military purposes2. Although the General Staff have not the same sources of information as the Russian Trade Committee, it appears to them to be an indisputable fact that the Russians are buying cloth to equip their troops, and from one firm alone they have bought what the clothing department estimate as sufficient to make 170,000 heavy coats, 70,000 riding breeches, and 60,000 jackets or 80,000 trousers. This, when it is considered in connection with certain absolutely reliable information received in August that Tchitcherin had told Krassin he was to buy clothing for soldiers&apos; coats without any regard to the price, makes it certain in the opinion of the General Staff that a large proportion of the goods will be used for the equipment of the Red Army.3. In an extract from the record of a Cabinet Meeting dated 21st September, the General Staff note that it was agreed that respecting the despatch of certain military stores which had been given to the Poles under the authority of the War Cabinet decision, No. 631 (4), the same treatment should be accorded to the-Poles as to Russia, and that if it was decided to prevent the export to Russia of the cloth, similar restrictions should be placed on the Polish military stores.The General Staff venture to suggest that the decision as regards the supply of . cloth to Russia should be made independently of the decision in the matter of the stores given to Poland which are already the property of the Polish Government. The information of the General Staff is that the prime necessity of the Soviet armies at the present time is clothing for the men, and, in their opinion, to provide the Soviet Government with material for uniforms is to give the Russians a concession which far exceeds the value of the military stores due to Poland.4. In conclusion, the General Staff consider that: the supply of clothing to the russian army is far more important to soviet interests than the supply of arms, for the army is already practically without uniforms and boots, and during the coming winter will, if unclothed, be impotent.(ii.) to assist the soviet government to reclothe its armies on such a scale as these contracts make possible, is calculated to encourage them not only to continue their efforts to destroy poland, but also to further their declared policy of attacking the british empire in the east.
