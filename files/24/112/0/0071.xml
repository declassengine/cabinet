THE FUTURE STATUS OF ARMENIA

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

With reference to ?P.1928, I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to the decision of the Supreme Council at San R?mo on April 26th, 1920 that the Allied powers were "unable by reason of their overwhelming responsibilities at present to assist Armenia otherwise than by the despatch of arms and munitions. 

This was in reply to the suggestion by the Council of the League of Nations on April 11th that it should recommend the Assembly to guarantee a loan from all countries members of the League.

I am strongly opposed to committing that country to participation in any international guarantee of any loan whether for Armenia or for any of the other countries which would at once be encouraged to make similar demands.

I think that the British Representative on the Council of the League should be instructed to state that H.M. Government is not prepared to participate in any such financial guarantee as is suggested and to object to my such proposal being submitted by the Council to the Assembly.
