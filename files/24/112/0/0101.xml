This Document is the Property of999&apos;   ^Srciilaptecl by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 16$ October 1920.Following is weekly telegram : -Gandhi now trying to use Home Rule League and local Congress Committees to enforce decisions of Special Congress. Attention concentrated on inducing voters not to vote. One effect of campaign has been to allow candidates with poor chances to retire with dignity. Leaders far from unanimous, Malaviya urging boycott of Councils mistake and moderate Press emphasises that nationalists by withdrawing merely let in moderate candidates without trouble and expense of election. Impossible to estimate with any exactness probable result of boycott of Councils, but so far this has proved most successful item in non-co-operation propaganda. Move-ment spreading in Bihar, where local Khilafat Committee carrying on active election propaganda, in Punjab and Bengal, where B. 0. Pal and others working vigorously, though Das and Chakravarty criticised for inaction. In United Provinces provincial political conference adopted Congress resolution with few dissentients. An attempt to establish nationalist schools being made in Bombay, and in Delhi arbitration courts being talked of with counsel and petition writers granted Sanads on payment of Rs. 50 and Rs. 5 respectively. It remains to be seen how experiment will work, but, as courts have no power to enforce decrees, unlikely to be extensively patronised. Impracticability of boycott of schools emphasised generally in Press, as adoption of this item of non^ co-operation would mean leaders of movement would have to cope with education-of eight million scholars or leave them without education.Mohamed Aii&apos;s arrival in India is giving support to movement and may lead to. intensification of Khilafat agitation. Visit of Ali Brothers and Gandhi to Aligarh is claimed by their supporters to have had, great success. It seems probable, however, that success has been purposely exaggerated.2. Madras report few more resignations from Council candidature and of honorary offices, but local interest concentrated on Brahmin non-Brahmin controversy; Khilafat agitators adopting social boycott against more prominent title holders and intimidation of respectable and moderate Mohamedans. Boycott of foreign goods unpopular. . Willingdon at conclusion of Madras Legislative Council pointed out non-co-operation illegal and unconstitutional, and appealed to moderate opinion co-operate with Government in combating it. Speech criticised in extremist Press, but welcomed by New India.3. Bombay report that Gandhi&apos;s attempt to override decision of Congress through sub-committee appointed to frame rules will strengthen nationalists fin determination to get even with Gandhi at next Congress. Report of Congress Sub-Committee received with some disappointment, as it shows task confronting non-co-operators involves hard work, sacrifice and money. All-India Khilafat Committee held meeting with a view to establishing national educational society at Mandvis, for which Chotani is said to have received five lakhs of rupees ; and attempts made, with some success, in spite of lower pay to induce Hindu and Moslem teachers in municipal vernacular schools to co-operate in establishment of national schools. As in^Madras, intimidation adopted to secure resignation of titles. Moderates, however, stirred to action, reported to be initiating scheme of propaganda and to be holding conference, over which Sir Chiman Lai Setalvad, who resigned High Court, will preside. Many seats uncontested in Bombay owing to withdrawal of Congress candidates. For two seats in India Legislative Assembly allotted to general electorate Bombay citizens only Chiman Lai Setalvad and Jamnados Dwarkadas nominated. We proscribed Daily Herald and prohibited its entry into India under Sea Customs Act, owing to its Bolshevik propaganda. Proscription protested against in extremist Press, and Daily Herald Support Committee constituted with Baptista as President.4. In Punjab, while Khilafat agitation quiescent, agitation among Sikhs intensified and non-co-operation movement securing stronger hold. Sikh agitators been conducting violent campaign in urban and rural areas. Concessions to Sikh sentiment made by Government in observance of Sikh festivals as holidays, permission, to wear Kirpans and reforms in management of Golden Temple,Amritsar, only have 2539     100 10.20
encouraged them to make further demands ; dangerous feature of movement is threats of violence and incitement to people to prepare for defiance of authority. Prosecution of individuals under ordinary law considered by Local Government undesirable, because (1) such prosecutions arouse considerable excitement, necessi-tating in one case pronouncement of judgment in jail, and in another holding trial in jail; and (2) appearance of initiating crusade against Sikhs should be avoided. At request of the Lieutenaut-Governor we have authorised application of Seditious Meetings Act to districts of Lahore, Amritsar and Sheikhpura, though proclamation will only be made if considered absolutely necessary. In view of liberty of speech enjoyed in large towns, cities of Lahore and Amritsar will be exempt, and steps will be taken not to interfere with ordinary meeiings of religious character, or election-eering meetings, provided moderate language used and not held for the purpose of exciting hatred between communities and Government. Circular issued in Punjab with a view to counteracting undesirable features of early stages of non-co-operation programme. District officers encouraged to discuss political matters with leaders of rural classes and to take no action calculated to alienate their sympathy, and, as regards educated classes, to encourage men (? of) reasonable opinions to influence extreme politicians in pointing out dangers of non-co-operation movement.5. Latest report from Assam shows deterioration in situation in that province, influenced probably by judgment in Kharial case. At Surma Valley Conference great rancour and bitterness shown, the coolie girl involved in the case being put on tlie platform. Non-co-operation resolution passed unanimously, majority in favour of concerted boycott of schools and courts, resolutions also advocating complete non-co-operation with and boycott of European merchants and planters, and that no welcome be accorded to His Excellency the Viceroy during his visit. Twelve members of local boards and municipalities announced resignation of seats. Kharial murder case attracted wide notice in Press. Read charged under section 326, Indian Penal Code. Jury returned unanimous verdict of &quot; Not guilty.&quot; Petition submitted to Chief Commissioner praying him to appeal against acquittal. Chief Commissioner,, in reviewing evidence, found genuine room for doubt and declined to appeal. Been turned into racial question and taken up by Amrita Bazaar Patrika and similar papers. Riot in tea gardens, reported in previous weekly telegram and separately, seems to have involved some 10,000 persons. Movement carefully planned with view to making effective demonstration at one garden after another. Though advantage taken of opportunity to molest unpopular members of garden staff and even loot traders&apos; shops, no special animosity indicated against Europeans as such, or against Government. Assault on S.P. probably not premeditated. Trouble due to high prices, combined probably with reduction in amount of overtime earnings due, to slump in tea market.6. Bombay postal strike continues. Calcutta tramway strike ended, but Bombay gas workers and Calcutta gas workers both on strike. Cities lighted by candles and acetylene flares. Lightning strike occurred among 10,000 employes of Bengal-Nagpur Railway Company, disorganising train service temporarily. Said tp be due to dismissal of certain employes. Strike settled by Agent, employes promising to return to work receiving strike pay, and putting their claims before Agent, who will consider them.
