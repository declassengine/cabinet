The leaders hold that a two-thirds majority for a strike is not now necessary.   Further negotiations are not impossible but the reports from the coal areas show clearly that the temper of the men is in favour of striking, even with the knowledge that they are likely to be beaten.Unemployment is growing and in Coventry it has become acute. Agitators are inciting the unemployed to seize the means of produc-tion, and their speeches are becoming more violent day by day. Disorder is only a question of time unless violent speeches are put down with a stronger hand.   The worst feature is that the men are told that unemployment is an artificial condition - a mere move in the oampaign of the employers against Labour.The increase in the cost of living is causing great dissatisfao-tion among all classes and is tending to alienate support of the Government.Increasing unrest is reported amongst transport workers and railway shopmen.Tfie engineers have asked  heir employers for an increase of 6d. per hfcur and the ooneolidabion of war wages and bonuses.   They are lesS&apos;prone to strike at the moment owing to the growing unemployment.The Communist Parties are chiefly engaged in fighting one anotherMr. Ramsay Macdonald and his Party, now on their way baok to this country, were subjected to a hostile Boishevik demonstration at BatumJ(This Dochmentjb the Property of ill8 Britannic Majesty&quot;a Government.
ggg COAL MINERS I &apos;/&apos; 1Ballot papers on the acceptance or rejection of the mine owners&apos; offer have been issued and the result will be known on October 14th.   The local executives of the South Wales. Lancashire and Cheshire, Yorkshire, Lanarkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire associations have recommended rejection, the latter with the adaed suggestion that if a majority against the offer be polled, the dispute should be referred to an impartial Tribunal.If the rank and file follow the reoommendation of their executives, it seems probable that a majority against the owners1 terms will be obtained.   Suoh a result, in the opinion of Mr. Hodges and other officials, would be a reaffirmation of the strike ballot; in their view a two-thirds majority is not necessary, as the existing notices are merely suspended and can only be cancelled by a direct mandate.  Mr. Bobson, a member of the National Executive and president of the Durham Miners1 Association, states that &quot;an immediate strike&quot; would follow the rejection of the owners1 offer.   It is more likely, however, that the issue of a strike or of further negotiations will depend upon the figures polled.My correspondent in Lancashire, who has more than fifty relations workinc in the pits, reports that the men, from one end of the County to the other, are convinced that the masters are deliberately working inferior seams and neglecting the supply of tubs and the improvement of roadB because the mines are under Government control, and that as soon as the mines revert to the owners all this will be altered and the output will be enormously increased^. In this belief they mean to strike, but, as one of them said ruefully, &quot;We shall come out with the certainty of being beaten.   For the first week we shall live on our back pay, for the second on our Union funds and in the third week weshall/
shall go back to work unless there Is a revolution.&quot;The result of all this must be that the die integrals of the National Federation is appreciably nearer. The Triple Alliance Itself is now nicknamed the &quot;Misalliance11 with some reason, for it has failed signally in the rail strike and the coal-mining crisis to produce the solidarl which has been the Utopia of the Labour movement.In South Wales there has for some time been a separatist movement; money is always the deoisive factor in industrial disputes and a large bocty of men in this coalfield believe that they would benefit substantially leaving the national federation.In most of the coalfields there is a deep-seated objection to a system of payment by results; the consist practice of oa1canny methods is partly responsible for t attitude, but the fact cannot be overlooked that many of steadier men have repeatedly complained that the shortag of tubs and railway wagons, bad roads, the working of poor seams and general lack of development greatly restr their output.Public opinion, although somewhat weary of procrastination, is still firmly behind the Government and the owners&apos; terms are generally considered to he fair to all parties in the dispute. , South Wales ... . .Sectional strikes against the, policy of the Miners&apos; federation of Great Britain have occurred and objection the.datum line seems unanimous.   The general demand is for the immediate and unconditional concession of the Ss. increase. Irancashire god CheshireIn many pits,the men brought their  eaa^to the surf on Saturday, but have resumed work.Horthumberland/
mt    J    &quot;IlorthumberlandOpinion is almost equally divided among the rank and file, but the president, secretary and treasurer advocate acceptance of the owners1 offer.   The gear was brought up in six pits last week and work was temporarily suspended on October 4th. DurhamThere is a considerable body of opinion against the terms and the voting will depend to a great degree on the decision of the council meeting to be held on October 9th. YorkshireThere has been very little activity in this coalfield but there appears to be no change in the attitude of the men, who are opposed to a strike. WarwickshireThe miners here think that the datum line will not greatly affect them, as the &quot;Butty system&quot; of contract work is prevalent and only the stallmen will reap the benefit. The men are violently opposed to this system and are prepared  to strike against it. -NottinghamshireIn spite of the recommendation of the executive to reject the terms, there is much division of opinion.   Ho great interest is shown and my correspondent thinks that many men will abstain from voting. LanarkshireIn.this area, where the extremist element has considerable strength, there have been stoppages; the general feeling is against acoeptanoe. StirlingshireThe men have expressed confidence in the leadership of Mr. Smillie, which the majority is inclined to follow.Negotiations/
m   4:   &quot;*Negotiations between the miners and the co-operative societies do not appear to have been successful as the latter evince considerable reluctance to aocept promissory .notes.tb4 &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;The &quot;Daily Herald0 appears to be tolling its own death knell.   On September 24th Mr. Ernest Bevin issued his appeal for funds and announced that the price of the paper would have to be increased to 2d.   Be complained that the appeal of November last produced only  90,000 instead of the necessary  400,000.   He points out that the circulation cannot be maintained at the enhanced price unless a printing office is opened in Manchester, for the paper is printed to early in London to compete with the telegraphic news received by the Manchester papers.Though there is no direct evidence on the point, it is probable that Mr. Bevin&apos;s statement that the money hitherto received on first debentures &quot;has only been sufficient for maintenance&quot; will set Trade Unionists thinking about the interest on their debenture investments, Especially as the only tangible security had already been mortgaged to nearly its full value.   The National Union of Railwayman has not yet paid over the promised  20,000 in spite of repeated hints.It is not unlikely that the workers will answer the question, &quot;Is the &quot;Daily Herald&apos; worth 2d. to you?&quot; in the negative, for there is increasing evidence that their faith in the paper has been.shaken.THIS OOMMUNIST P AMISSAlthough increasing unemployment is adding to thestrength/
strength of the Communist parties, the prospect of their unification grows more remote, and must seriously perturb those leaders who have been ordered by Lenin to compose their differences.The Communists have one virtue; they oall a spade a spade or even something with a more incisive epithet.John S. Clarke, who has been sitgmatised by theCommunist Party of Great Britain as &quot;Mrs. Snowden&apos;s newconvert&quot;, describes that Party as:&quot;in organisation whose chief claim to distinction, so far, is that it is composed of drivelling nonentities intoxicated with conceit, who have borrowed the Bolshevik ideas without borrowing the brains necessary to execute them ... Information by the mass specially preened, pruned, doctored and cooked by the officials of the old British Socialist Party was sent into Russia with the deliberate object of misleading the Bolsheviks as to the true state of affairs in Britain ... Not until I went to Moscow was I aware that such a tremendously powerful, throne-shaking, empire-tottering organisation existed in Britain ... Sven in Aesop&apos;s day the frogs who burst themselves because they wanted to imitate the cows were recognised.   So it is with the British Communists,&quot;A. 33. Cook, the secretary of the South Wales CommunistCouncil, igis not impressed by the representatives of SylviaPankhursfs group at the reoent Cardiff meeting and deolaresthat:&quot;Wine-tenths of the vaunted activities of these people is sheer bluff, but it doesnft follow that if they can bluff the ISnglish movement they can do so here with us who know the South Wales movement and the men who compose it.&quot;Relations between the Communist Party of Great Britain and Sylvia Pankhursfs group are equally strained, for McLaine has wired to &quot;The Communist&quot;, f?Just seen/Dreadnought&apos; statement that Sylvia Pankhursfs party has been received into the Third International.   It is untrue ... Her reference to so called united party makes me regret my magnanimity. I should have denounced her double dealing.&quot;Finally, 12. T. Whitehead has raised a storm of protest by defining the mathematical ratio of a man&apos;s ideas to hisincome/
income:&quot;A man earns the proletarian wage of  5 per week, erflp that man of necessity thinks proletarian and genuinely communistic; his wage advances  1 per week and he diverges from the. genuine communistic position slightly; with every increase lie varies accordingly and if he gets  10 a week it is physically impossible for him to be a genuine Communist.   Bob Williams gets  14 a week, therefore Bob Williams can never be a genuine Communist.&quot;Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made at organisation.  Questionnaires have been issued to the local j branches as to the conditions in their areas, and there is an! enormous output of propaganda literature.   At Kentish Town    I great efforts are being made by the unennloyod and there is  1 a talk of organising c raid on one of the big stores in the   ! locality.COUNCILS OF ACTION IThe Councils of Action are reported to be already practically dead.&apos;  The national Council is attempting to whip 1 up the laggards by holding a demonstration on October 17th.VIOLS!?T aPBSCBBS &apos; fSince the formation of Communist parties there has been a marked increase in the number of violent SDeeches.

(l n   ,,f.......    .. ... r,f4;, ,   ,,(., some agitators keep within the supposed limits of the law, many others openly advocate revolution by violence and the overthrow of the Constitution.   Gaining courage from their immunity, these men are becoming more extreme:week by week and my correspondents report tnat the general public and in sof cases trade unionists comment adversely on the license given to them.   While it may be said,&apos; on the one hand, that prosecuti makes martyrs, it is equally true that many of the agitators are cowards and the imprisonment of one of them would stem the tide of oratory which is inflaming the minc-s of tiie unemployed,teaching/
- 7 -174teaching the hungry that theft is justifiable and generally accentuating revolutionary feeling which may easily assume serious proportions during the winter.The following extract from,a speech made by Matthews at Manchester on October 3rd, to an audience of 1500, is typical:&quot;you live in a house, probably in a slum, but it is no use cursing the walls of the house.   But if there are rats in the house the first thing you do is to clear them out and you are not too particular about the methods you employ.   There are rats in England, Capitalistic rats, who exploit you whilst awake and when you are sleeping they are stealing the bread you require for your children.   you are supposed to have fought for freedom abroad and you are content to live in slavery at home.   (tfhy don&apos;t you clear the rats out o,f England and make it fit to live in.   We have used weapons in the great war and you will have to use weapons again, but not against the workers of other countries this time; not against the workers at home, but against the parasitical rats who are in your home and you will- not have to be too particular about the methods you employ.   Think well over what I have said and be ready for ?Jhen the tine cbceo.&apos;&quot;C0V3DTEYUnemployment has reached an acute stage in Coventry, where communist agitators are particularly active   Extreme doctrines are advocated at daily meetings; an unemployment committee called the Soldiers1 arid Workers1 Council has been formed and processions are visitinf the more important factories, when meetings are held inside or outside the gates in order to enlist tho sympathy of men who still have work. The ultimate object of these marches was disclosed by a speaker on September 30th, who said &quot;Before long we shall be going into those shops and taking nossession of machines and demanding the raw material to work on c,rA .my for wtiat we do. We havo gone past the time for pious resolutions.   How is the time for action.&quot;Most of the demonstrations havo been held on Tool Meadow, but the men declare that they will use the Labour Exohange inbad/
M   q    mbad weather.   Some of the leaders are anxious to approach the Russian Delegation, with a view to ascertaining and supplying some of the needs of Russia by iiieans of a factor taken over by the civic authorities.So far the Coventry unemployed, who are in touch with the Mayor, have been orderly; only about 500 from a possible 4,000 attend the meetings.&apos;.The local branches of the National Union of 3x-8ervio Men (.90 momiors J&apos; have joined the &quot;Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Council&quot;, of which Matybs, a tireless agitator, is preside? Many extremists are visiting Coventry, which is regarded a suitable for the establishment of soviet control.James Stewart has directed the Seoretary of 1he Coven Communist Party to take the names of all members who posse motor-cycles or bioyoles and would be available for literature distribution in the event of a miners&apos; strike. The actual membership of the branch does not exceed 15, but many recruits are expected from the ranks of the unemployed.TH3 BMGINE3RIM.6 IITJUSTRYOn September 50th the Industrial Courts Act 1919 expl and with it, except in cases where Statutory Orders apply, the legal force of wages which were fixed under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, of 1918 and 1919.   The enginee have therefore forwarded direct to the employers the daman which was recently refused by the Industrial Court for an increase of 6d. per hour for journeyman time workers, with equivalent advance in pieoe work rates; 3d. per hour for apprentices and boys and the consolidation of all war advance and bonuses.The men appear confident that they will obtain an advand/
and prefer direct negotiation with the employers; there is at present little enthusiasm for a strike, the fear of unemployment acting as a powerful deterrent and inducing oa1 canny methods.An agreement has been reached between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Engineering and Uational &apos;j!mployers Federations respecting overtime and night shift   rates, which has yet to be ratified by a ballot.   There is considerable opposition in the Ban Chester area.ffEBLBG AMONG aX-SJ^RVICIi) HBM. -There has been an increase in meetings and processions in the London area, but some of the speakers show signs of nervousness and discourage disorder.   Dissension has also arisen! regarding funds and &quot;it is alleged that Jones, one of the ring-leaders, is guilty of dishonesty.&apos; A deputation from the,      ;     t ., - / ..    . .(;    --.      .. ;     tii . ; ; . . ri  ft-    QfX    iWfiflirt IInternational Union ofService lien interviewed the Marylebone Council on&apos;September .30th and ashed that a special fund Dif;hi&apos;be raised to meet cases of distress.   &apos;jhe temper of the lien is ugly &quot;and it is not unlikely that disorder and theft will occur.   On      .js:.:ber 29th they replaced the furniture of one of their members who r.ed been ejected from a house in Zilburn.It seoms possible that the i^-tional Union of J3x-Service Lleri will shortly merge with the various labour and extremist groups and a ballot is beirj* taker, on the subject of &quot;&apos; decentralisation.

THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONSExtraordinary efforts are being made by Labour all over the country to maintain and gain municipal seats.   The platform, which is more or less general, covers housing, reform of the rating system, education and the municipalisation of necessaries such as milk and coal. There seems little doubt that unless the electorate is aroused from its customary lethargy the activity of the Labour Party will be rewarded.TIB imdibpbmdiaflt labour PA3TYDissension in the ranks of the Independent Labour Party is causing the leaders grave concern.   On Ootober 2nd Mr. Snowden condemned the use of the Independent Labour Party platform by industrialists,   he said that an unbridgable gulf existed between the Independent Labour-Party-and Communism, which was further from the Independent Labour Party than Liberalism or Toryism.   Toleration was a vice when it was allowed to become an abuse.   Force could never settle any problem of a domestic, political or social charaoter.   &quot;I would rather see our own movement dead.and damned than seeking to attain its ends by bloody methods of force and violence ... Personally I think the Independent Labour Party is going to be destroyed unless ....(it can fulfil the ideal of having some-thing definite to put before the, people, so that the. Independent Lai)our Party pan s;?eak witn one voice in regard to policy and programme       &apos;//e must cease to extend the toleration of our platform to those who.do not believe in the methods of the Independent Labour Party and are advocating methods which are absolutely opposed to it.&quot; . ..,, jack mo ...., .;.Since his return from Hussia, Jack Tanner has beentelling/
telling various extremists how easy it is to get money in Russia  He states that he visited a factory where &quot;cart, loads&quot; of Treasury notes were being turned out daily and that it was pimply a case of helping oneself.He is said at present to be   in a state of affluence; his wife is dressed in expensive clothes and furs and he isl circulating money ejnong his friends.   A new paper entitled! &quot;The Big Stick&quot;   has ,1 ust been started.Nicholson and two other men are reported to be going to Russia shortly, probably on behalf of the InternationalUnio4 of Ex-Service lien. .   .*    *&apos;SINN FED? IN GREAT britain in Sinn Fein circles the recent reprisals have been nnul discussed and are regarded as Useful propaganda abroad, whip] will Borve to illustrate the misgovernment of Ireland and thl justice of Sinn IPoin claims.There are reports, not yet confirmed, of drilling by SiJ Feiners in the Newport area.Irish neople in Yorkshire are said to be subscribing freely to the Distress Fund.Drunken brawls continue in the Glasgow area, but no unusual Sinn Fein activity has been reported during the week,]Michael 0&apos;Kelly Simington was found last week to be in possession of four service rifles.   On searching his pren-ises, Office of Works plcns of tee Irish Off ice&apos;and a quantity of Sinn ?ein literature wore seized.   liljvjuiries sho^ tfiat this man was employed as a clerk in the Office of V&apos;or)-:s from the  10th April, 1916, to the 31st August, 1916, when tt\ joined the Army, and from March, 1919, to July, 19S0, whon ho resigned.   It is intended &quot;to charge Siding-ton with stealing the plans.   It is not thought that he entered the Office of&apos; Works/
Works for the purpose of stealing the plans, out that he was brought under the influence of Sean tlcCraith and Art OfBrien, of the Irish Self-Determination League, and incited to commit the offence, which will probably go for trial.lam)&apos;     :&apos;&apos; IKSlI- ?f l.^S;^Sl&apos;SThe general situation shows some slight improvement, although outrages continue to be numerous,Energetic military action is affecting the Irish Republican Army as is shown by the falling off of recruits, and it would seem that to keep up to strength a form of conscription, enforced by terrorism, is being adopted.All information points to the fact that the whole policy and action of the Irish &quot;Republic&quot; is dominated entirely by the Terrorist Group or Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, of.whom Michael Collins and Austin Stack are the active leaders.   . ,r,, .The moderate party, if they can be so called^ headed by Arthur Griffith and ethers, are looked upon as more  - puppets, although they are certainly endorsing all that the Terrorists do.In many parts of Ireland the farmers and shopkeepers, who represent the more stable element of tho population, are growinj tired of the continued exactions of Sinn Fein and see in its present policy the road to national bankruptcy.   They would like to shake themselves free from Sinn Pein but, with no power behind them at present, are powerless to move.The oampaign of slander started against those mo are loyally endeavouring to carry out the difficult task of suppressing disorder in Ireland, does not appear to be meeting with quite the success its originators hoped, as most of theBritish/
British and Foreign newspapers are refusing to circulate libellous accusations unsupported by evidenoe.The general public have lost all interest in the Mac Swine y case and even the Sinn l-einers themselves show a reluctance to discuss it.   The latest suggestion put forward is that the Government itself is responsible for keeping him alive bo long.Sinn Fein finances in Ireland appear to be far from satisfactory.Dublin has been quiet during the week and Sinn Fein activity appears to be decreasing.The munition striko drags on and, as the strikers&apos; funds are now very low and subscriptions havo practioallyj ceased, much discontent prevails amongst tho members of tl Transport Workers and other Labour Unions.   Owing to a strike of the crews for increased wages, which commenced on $?tober 3rd, most of the cross-channel boats are held up.   The reduction in the wages of many of the Dublin Corporation employees and tne dismissal of others adds tf the general unrest.
