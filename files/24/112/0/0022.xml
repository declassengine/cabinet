SECEEI .   PRESENT POSITION, lBBSHBOTIMG UI^employment.1EMORANDW  BY   THE   MINISTER   Qg   LABOOK. The general state of unemployment after the armistice was marked first of all &quot;by a rapid rise owing to aemobilisa-tion of the forces and discharges of munition workers. This culminated about the middle of May 1919, when there were well over a million workpeople in receipt of Out-of-Work . Donation, about 400,000 of whom were ex-Sailors and Soldiers. With the recovery of industry there followed a steady fall in the rate of unemployment.. On the whole this was maintained until the early summer of this year, allowanoe being made for a good deal of unemployment last autumn owing to the ironmoul&amp;ers1 strike and to the usual seasonal depression in the winter.   From about May last till the end of August there was a slow but, steady rise in the rate of unemployment; but in spite of this at the end of August the rate of unemployment was considerably below the average for that time of the year for the ten years before the war, e,g. the Trade Union percentage of unemployment at the end of August was 1.6, as compared with 4.5 for,the ten years 1903-1912.There are indications that from the end of August a considerably mere rapid Increase in unemployment was beginning to take place;   for.instance, the figures of the Employment Exchange live Registers which had already increased by about 15,000 (from SOS,000 to 218,000) In four weeks during August, increased by about 28,500 (free 318,000 to .346,500) in the four weeks of September.   Duxla^ the same periods the numbers of vacancies notified by-employers fell considerably.M     1     Ml(THIS DOCDMFJ IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S
There have beer, numerous pessimistic reports recently in the press with regard to prospective unemployment. Whilst these reports are no doubt somewhat highly coloured, they appear to contain some element of truth, as may be illustrated from the following notes on some important industries:*n ^e optton trade the question of organised short time for the whole of the spinning &quot;branch has been dis-cussed between the employers and workpeople1s associa-tlons and although such proposals have in view the prevention of a too rapid fall in prices as well as an equalisation of the amount of work available they are undoubtedly the outcome of adverse prospects.   The numbers employed in this industry are probably nearly two per cent below those for a year ago.Short time is also being worked in other textile trades especially in the lace linen and Jute trades.In all the textile trades the total numbers employed are less than in the corresponding month of 1919,In the boot and shoe trade there has been a considerable amount of index-employment since the beginning of the spring,*n ^e leather industry also trade is slack.In the Motor Industry there is a good deal of slackness at present some works of considerable magnitude having closed down and discharges have been fairly numerous-Short time in other branches of the engineering trade is also reported from several districts.In the ShipbuiIdinfl Industry  there is much unemployment at the repairing centres and some repair work is reported to have been sent abroad.   One cause&apos;
of the falling off in employment in ship-repairing in South Y/ales is the stoppage of exports of coal.On new work the yards continue busy with existing orders, but fresh ordero are being held back.In the steel trade in Sofcth Wales employment is reportod as unsatisfactory generally and in the Sheffield heavy steel trade there have been numerous discharges,*n ^e food trades generally there is a considerable amount of unemployment.In a number of large towns there are undoubtedly a groat number of unemployed, the great majority of whom are young and unskilled ex-Service men.   The poorer districts in and around London, Bristol, Liverpool, Plymouth, Ports-mouth, Leicester and Dundee may be mentioned as instances.To sum up there is no reason to suppose that the amount of unemployment now is as great as it was in even an average year before the War,   There is, however, at present a falling off in employment which may very possibly develop into a serious depression towards the end of this year and the beginning of next*   The dangerous feature of the situation is that so many of the unemployed are ex-Service men, forming an organised body which may easily take to violent measures; threats of violence are in fact common enough already, and in a few oases outbreaks have actually occurred.   It must not be forgotten also that for nearly ten years there has been practically no unemployment in the ordinary sense and, whilst the present amount of unemployment may be no greater than was common before tho war, those affected by it have forgotten, or have never experienced., the trials of unemployment and, for special reasons, are not likely to acquiesce tamely in it.(Sgd)   T, J. -USLCSIAMARA.,1&apos;Ministry of Labour,5th October, 1920*
