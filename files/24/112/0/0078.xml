SECRET.

CABINET.

C.F. 1977.

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND THE RIGHT TO STRIKE.

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

I circulate a note by the Treasury representative on the Shipbuilding Trades Joint Council respecting the attitude of the men&apos;s representatives towards the Cabinet decision on strikes in the Civil Service. (Minute 3 of Cabinet 54(20) of October 12th, 1920).

I propose to instruct the Government representatives on the Committee of the four Councils to say that the views of the staff side were reported to the Cabinet who adhere to their decision. They may add, if it seems desirable, that a Cabinet decision is a decision of the whole Cabinet for which all its members bear an equal responsibility. Finally, rather than allow the destruction of Whitleyism at this stage or the resort to "drastic action", they should invite the staff side to seek an interview with the Prime Minister and other representatives of the Cabinet.

Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.,

October  18th, 1920.




RIGHT TO STRIKE.

The Cabinet decision was received by the men with extreme disfavour.

They hold absolutely that the legal right to strike claimed under the Trades Disputes Act, cancels the powers given to the Treasury by the Superannuation Acts to reduce pensions tor striking.

A certain section openly stated their disbelief that this was anything acre than a Treasury decree and persistently demanded the names of the Ministers who sub-scribed to the decision.

They were united in abuse of the pronouncement, and in the method whereby the view of the Government was conveyed to them, for they obviously expected &amp; debate.

They decided to refer the matter to the Joint Committee of the four Councils which meets on November l7th. At this they express their intention, should the Cabinet decision be unchange? either to withdraw from "Whitley, or to demand that the Cabinet receive ? deputation, or to take "drastic action".

At this next meeting they will assuredly ask if there is any mortification of the Cabinet&apos;s decision and whether the Cabinet has again been consulted. ?ay I be informed on this?

(Intld.) J.T.H.
