i, CU!RET71THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY ?S GOVERNMENT,WORKMENfS COMPENSATION .Memorandum by the Minister of Health.M.H. 27.In my brief memorandum to the Cabinet dated 11th August last^ I drew attention to the fact that the proposed scheme of Workmen18 Compensation directly concerned Health and National Insurance, and promised to submit a more detailed memorandum, with a view to the avoidance of overlapping and divided departmental responsibility, when the subject had been fully explored by my Department.The Report of the Committee, if adopted, will effect a radical change in the attitude of the State to Workmen&apos;s Compensation. In future, the Government will have a certain degree of responsibilities -ty for the proper administration of the Act, for the premiums and benefits paid under the Act, and, sooner or later, will have a direct responsibility for furnishing proper medical, surgical and Institutional treatment to workers covered by the Act - a complete departure from the present conditions is therefore involved. Employers will, however, continue to pay the whole of the Premiums, as the risks oovered are directly incidental to employment, and no contribution from the State or the Workers has been suggested, or indeed would be appropriate.It is proposed by the Report to set up a new Branch, in a Department of State which will license and supervise Insurance Companies and Mutual Associations for Workmen!s Compensation Insurance.The range of persons covered for Workmenrs Compensation will differ but slightly from the range under National Health Insurance and, with certain limited exceptions, Insurance Is to be made compulsory, the necessary enforcement being secured , the Departmental Committee suggest, by means of the Inspection Staff of the Ministry of Health.
The Report proposes that the functions hitherto, performed by the Home Office, the Board of Trade * and the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies in connection with V,&apos;orkmenTs Compensation should now be centred in one Department under a Minister responsible to Parliament.    Certain minor4 functions at present performed by the Ministry of Health in connection with agreements for lump sum settlements, in which approved societies are interested, must necessarily continue in this Department.The principal new duties comtemplated in the Report may besummarised as follows(1)   The licensing and supervision of Insurance Companies and Mutual Associations.(2)   Fixing rates of premiums.(3)   Arranging the scale of commission to be paid to agents.(4)   Arranging as to the expenses of Management of Insurance Companies.(5)   The valuation of outstanding claims.(6)   Checking the amounts reserved by Insurance Companies and certain Mutual Associations for unexpired risks.(7) Issuing Certificates of Exception to certain employers.(8) Inspection of employers to secure compliance.(9) Surgical and medical treatment for injured workers.(10) Extension of the system of Medical Referees,(11)   Granting discounts from premium rates in consideration of accident preventive devices.(12)   Distribution of weekly allowances to orphans, probably through the Registrars of the County Courts.(13)   An annual review of the development of Workmen&apos;s compensation and comparative legislation in all countries,There is a marked similarity between the work involved in the foregoing functions Nos. 1 to 6 as regards Insurance Companies, and that now undertaken by the Insurance Department of the Ministry of Health with regard to Approved Societies.      Some of these Approved Societies are allied with Companies which transact Workmen!s Compensation business.
The issue of Certificates of Exception (No.7) is closely analogous to similar work performed by the Ministry of Health in the granting of Certificates of Exception to certain public bodies and companies, and I may add that, in order to avoid overlapping, the Ministry of Health is about to undertake most of this class of work for the Ministry of labour in connection with the new Unemployment Insurance Act,The Report suggests that functions Nos. 8 and 9 should be undertaken by the Ministry of Health, and contemplates, as regards No. 10 that the Medical Officers of the Ministry of Health may sooner or later be used in this connection.When, if ever, the Scheme under No. 11 comes into operation^ it would be necessary to secure a Certificate of Compliance from the Factory Department of the Home Office before the Insurance Department would be in a position to grant the appropriate discount off a premium rate.Function No. 13 is closely analogous to the work now undertaken by the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Health in connection with Social insurance generally.Apart from these purely administrative considerations, it may be suggested that Workmen!s Compensation is primarily a Health question, and, as the Report states, there is an increasing body of public opinion In favour of regarding the restoration of earning capacity of injured persons as of not less importance than monetary compensation.This is already the trend of National Health Insurance, and It is to be expected that the future development of Workmenrs Compensation will tend to concentrate more on the re-habilitation of injured workers, and the investigation, prevention and control of industrial diseases and accidents, rather than on the pecuniary relief of distress,     It is important to realise in this connection that the duty of investigating excessive sickness among workers dueto
to the conditions or nature of employment is already provided for by Statute (National Insurance Act, 1911) and devolves apon the Ministry of Health.I suggest with great reluctance now that a radical change in ^orkmen!s Compensation administration is to be effected; that the responsibility for the working of the scheme would require to be undertaken by the Insurance Department of the Ministry of &amp;ealtiu By this means the establishment of a new Insurance Department whiAh must create a certain amount of overlapping and divided departmental responsibility will be avoided, and powers and duties, will be centred in the Ministry of Health which will not only harmonise with its present&apos;policy and equipment but will also be the more economical way of dealing with this new work.taNISlRY OP HEALTH.C.
