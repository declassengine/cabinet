Request I may be informed as to the treatment to be accorded to Bolshevik armed vessels if met at sea.   Report received yester-4ay Wednesday from Riga stating that two repeat two submarines off Hapsal said to be proceeding to operate against munitions traffic poland via Danzig.   while this is not confirmed it and other reports as to surface vessels exercising suggest possibilities of activities.   It would be possible to keep within the spirit of Their Lordships orders by shadowing surface vessels until a definite aggressive act has been committed but submarines would ?require different handling.   My own view is that the onl1- status of Bolshevik armed vessels onihigh seas is that rf a p:rate but I do net wish to embarrass H.M. Government.

Such support ia not, however, to be given without definite instructions from Admiralty.   You should report any signs of ouch aggression.Should the offensive action on the port of ships of the Soviet Government develop into a threat against the British Uaval Force unter your command, you should not become engaged with a superior force.   It may be necessary in such circum-stances for you to retire to Copenhagen, where reinforcements could be sent to you.It is essential that you should not interfere in any way with local politics, nor give any colour to the assumption that Great Britain is favouring one party or another in the Baltic provinces.Your should be careful, in dealing with any request which may be nade to you, to raise no hope of any Military assistance from the Allies.   The British Government has definitely decided that no Military foroe is to be sent.
men are to &quot;be landed from ships of your Squadron,     Ajunless in some very exceptional circumstances, and then only under such conditions as would ensure no risk being run 3&apos;f parties bein^ cut off, a larger force being required to extri&apos; cate them, and Great Britain being thereby involved in a    ; larger commitment than is desired.xxxxxxxx SECRET.
