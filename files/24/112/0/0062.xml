(THIS DOCUIvreyT IS TH? PROPERTY 0; HIS PRlTAl?rIC MAJ^3&apos;rv&apos;S GOTOttTOTT) .SECRTT, s-CABIN E T. C.P.1962, &apos;PROPOSED PTTOATOT? COURT 0? IFTFPJyATIONALJUSTICE .Memorandum &quot;by the lav&apos; pffioers of the crown* (previous papers C.P.1Q39, I9p5 and 1956.)In cur opinion there are good $rounds for apprehending that the establishment of such a Court as is suggested - at all events at the present time- would be contrary to the interests of this country.   Under Articles 33 and 34, a state can, in case of a dispute, be brought against its vdll before the court by another, and as between states which are members of the League the court is to have jurisdiction, without any special agree-ment, to determine any case of a legal nature concerning a question in international law.   It cay, wc think, be gravely doubted whether it would be politic for Great Britain in any circumstances to bind herself to refer any disputes which might arise in the future within this very wide jurisdiction to a tribunal of whose impartiality the has no assurance.   It may be asked perhaps whether it is reasonable to expect impartiality from any permanent international court.   And there are special rrasons why this oountry should not be a party to such an engagement now,   it ia well known that some neutral nations (e.g. aweden and Holland) are dissatisfied with our proceedings during the war, and also with some of the decisions of our-prize courts.   If the proposed Court were established it would be open to these and other States to make claims based on such proceedings, and, if they were not settled diplomatically, to oarry them before the new court, with the result that we might (and probably should)) have&apos; to pay very heavy compensation, and
0 hi $various decisions of the priae courts mi.?,ht in effect &quot;be reversed.Another serious objection to the setting up of the Court at the present tine is that Africa is not yet a member of the league of Nations and would therefore have no influence) on the election of the judges.   Nor would America or other states&apos; outside the league be bound in any way &quot;by the rulings of the Court, so that there would &quot;be a get of rules of international law growing up which would &quot;be binding on some of the Great powers as well as the smaller states members of the League, but not on the Great powers and the states outside the Lea;3ue.(intla.) B. * G.H. &quot;      S.1..P.October 14th, 1920.c
