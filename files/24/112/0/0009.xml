this Document is the Property of      ^^/r qifHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.0ENT1ALRUSSIAN   TRUTH   DELEGATION.Admiralty 1 Memorandum for the Cabinet.I am very anxious to support Lord Curzon^s memorandum dealing with the expulsion of Mr; Krassli k Oo. from London.I think the country is hopelessly puzzled by the policy of the Government:   and I believe that public opinion is rapidly growing and will shortly prove itself to be determinedly hostile to the retention in this country of representatives of the Soviet Government who, under the pretence of trade, are devoting all their energies, their money^ and their time, to spreading dangerous propaganda in the country.Information which I receive from private sources tells me that merchants and others who were engaped in attempts to re-establish commercial relations with the Russian Soviet Government, are breaking off all connection one after the other.    The ^irm of which Sir William Bull4 &quot;r.p., is a member^ and who acted for Mr. Krassin, have severed their association.Further, is it not clear that Krassin himself has been quite recently personally responsible for telegrams to the Soviet Government at Moscow whioli prove that he is nearly as guilty as Kameneff ?I would call attention to Foreign Office telegram No. 412 from Commander Luke at Tiflis, dated 24th September, in which he tells us that the Georgian Consul at Baku states that he obtained permission from Azerbaijan Soviet for the release of British naval and military prisoners below the rank of officer, &quot;but that this order was cancelled by Moscow; and yet only the other day we were assured that the Soviet Government at Moscow has no responsibility for the retention of the prisoners at Baku.Even supposing that Mr. Krassin is honest and straight-forward in his dealings, which I do not believe, is there not some evidence to show that he has not got the confidence and the support of his masters at Moscow ?     I have gbod reason to believe that a letter published one day last..week in the &quot;Scotsman&quot; from an officer with General Wrangel!s army, showing up the true character of the Soviet Government, has attraoied. a good deal of attention.Prom the Admiralty point of view, it is impossible to exaggerate the danger of keeping Krassin &amp; Co. here:   there is no doubt that propaganda work among the sailors1- and employes in the dockyards has been increasing.     I cannot prove that this is due to Mr. krassin-, but it seems to me to be more&apos;than probable that he is in a large measure responsible for it: and of course so long as we keep him here, it is very difficult for us to check the spread of this Pernicious form of revolutionary movement.    What is to be gained by allowing these Russians to remain here ?   I do not believe there is any chance of the resumption of trade; while I am convinced that their presence is a great danger to the State; and therefore I urge that ^hey should be returned to Russia without delay.(Id.)   W. K. L.30. 9. 20.
