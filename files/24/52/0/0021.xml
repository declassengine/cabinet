COPY,DETAILED REPORT ON BOMB RAID CARRIED OUT .16th MAY,, 1918,12 De Havilland 4s, left 6,SO &amp;tm, to bomb the BADISCEE..ANILINIS und SODA-FABRIK at MANHHJ5I51 with the alternative of the railway station and sidings at SAAR8RUCKEN,    The lines were crossed at 12,000 feet over ARMACOURT,    As the Rhine Valley was covered with clouds the leader made for SAARBROCKBN, via ST, AVOID.    On the way many enemy  aircraft   were observed getting height, but they did not attack until over the objective,24 112*-lb, teombs were dropped from 13,000 feet. Owing to the very severe fighting which immediately ensued very few bursts could be observed, but five bursts were seen on the railway, one of which caused a small fire, three on the Station and two in buildings near the Station,The fighting now became very severe, the original   11 enemy aircraft now being increased to about 25.     One of our machines was shot down in flames.   The enemy aircraft did not appear keen on attacking the formation, but appeared to be watching to pounce on stragglers *    According to the Observers enemy aircraft appeared to be diving away vertically in all directions, several leaving the combat.     Owing to this and number of enemy aircraft, pilots and observers say it was extraordinarily hard to tell which machines were really brought down and which were merely diving away vertically to leave the combat.    The general impression is that five of the enemy were accounted for, but in writing their combat reports in cold blood after the excitement,.it was found very hard to substantiate the claim.    Three enemy aircraft certainly went down completely out of control, but it was impossible to follow them to earth owing to the fighting.A total of 7 plates were exposed.The lines were recrcesed at 13,000 feet at LUKfiVILLE.    The remaining 11 machines landed at 9.35 a.m,Anti-aircraft fire was normal.The weather was cloudy to the East in the Rhine Valley, but clearer towards the West.In the Field. (Sd.)
