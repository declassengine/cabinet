losses of armed MERCHANT CRUISERS..!^,Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet,.,In the statements showing the loss of Merchant Tonnage which are published monthly, Vessels employed as Armed Merchant Cruisers or Boarding Vessels, and flying the White Ensign, are not included.As, however, these vessels formed part of the British Mercantile Marine at the outbreak of the War, the loss is taken into account in compiling the monthly balance sheet of Merchant Tonnage in the Naval Appreciation which is submitted to the War Cabinet,      The loss was also taken into account in the General Review of the World1s Tonnage position&apos;from the outbreak of War given by me in the House of Commons on the 5th and 20th March last.The losses of this type of vessel are, comparatively speaking, small.     Since the commencement of the War, 29 vessels of 173,000 gross tons have been lost.(Signed)    ERIC GEDDES,
