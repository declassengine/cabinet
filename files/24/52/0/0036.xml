1 y^[Tlii^pojcument is the Property..of His Britannic IIajesty&apos;s Governmeat.]      * V/; 11?[May 17, 1918.]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,j       Foreign Office,Russia /COS.THE POSITION&quot; IN THE UKRAINE.&quot; THE villages [in the Ukraine] have changed into so many independent republics governed by the omnipotent will of the people, as revealed in the meetings of the entire village population, men and women,&quot; wrote, in the Cracow &quot;Czas&quot; of the 15th March, an exceedingly well-informed correspondent, to judge by internal evidence a Polish country gentleman from the Ukraine. &quot; . . . . Village committees have tried to do constructive work, but are continually hampered by the refractory attitude of the population, which refuses to he governed by them, but insists on their carrying out its will, always controlled and criticised. The composition of these committees changes continually, members resigning or being forced to do so. Sometimes they are beaten by the peasants, or even seriously wounded, and accusations are raised against them of following out private interests. The :Bosiaks&apos; (the bare-footed) complain against the rich peasants ; the soldiers from the front form the extreme opposition ; the women add considerably to the confusion of the village politics.&quot; &quot;The peasants recognise no one except their own committees and insist on their right to govern themselves,&quot; says euphemistically a memorandum of the Ukrainian Union For Trade and Agriculture, as quoted in a PoKsh daily. &quot; They do not want to hear of a Central Rada. The . Ukrainian Government has no administrative organs at its disposal to enforce obedience. Attempts to do so by military force have failed because the soldiers sent against the peasants pass over to their side and fraternise with them.&quot; &quot; Almost the entire country is deprived of regular postal service,&quot; writes someone just returned from the Ukraine in the Cracow &quot; Nowa Reforma &quot; of the 12th April. &quot; One does not see a newspaper for weeks on end.  There is a whole series of local authoritieswho administer &apos; law &apos; and justice of their own.....   They do not communicateeither with each other or with anybody outside.   In the villages the peasants have allkinds of arms at their disposal, from a rifle up to an aeroplane and artillery.....Comparatively the host order prevails near the railway lines for about half a mile each side, so far does the power of the Allied armies (German and Austrian) extend. .....It is from there that the surplus of food is derived for export.&quot;The Polish papers had a purpose in painting the condition of the Ukraine in the blackest colours. &quot; If tho occupying Powers wished to attain any results,&quot; wrote a correspondent in the &quot; Czas &quot; of the 18th March, &quot; they themselves must take over the administration of the country and give up all one-sided policy [i.e., of dealing with the Ukrainians]. They must invite the co-operation of educated people acquainted with local conditions and inclining to the West&quot; [i.e., the Polish Roman Catholic gentry, not the Greek Orthodox Great Russians, who incline to the East.]. Yet the German authorities themselves have implicitly admitted the substantial truth of these reports; however unwilling they must have been to drop their Ukrainian plans and to support the Polish gentry, they found it&apos; necessary to do so for social reasons, and will in turn receive eager support from the Polish gentry. With regard to the Great Russian gentry, the Germans have gone even further in their schemes for co-operation ; it seems that they propose to make the Ukraine the &quot;Kindergarten&quot; of a monarchist counter-revolution in Russia, which, living by the help of the Germans, would be absolutely dependent on them.The social structure of the Ukraine explains its politics. It is a country of the size of France almost exclusively agricultural; practically without any important industrial towns, except for a few large ports (Odessa, Nicolaief) ; uniform in its-social conditions; with&apos; its social and economic stratification strongly emphasised by differences of language, culture, and religion. The peasauts speak the Little Russian dialect; a small group of nationalist intelligentsia now professes an Ukrainian nationality distinct from that of the Great Russians. AVhether such a nationality exists is usually discussed in terms in which, the question can receive no answer. Were one to ask the average peasant in the Ukraine his nationality, he would answer that he is Greek Orthodox; if pressed to say whether lie is a Great Russian, a Pole, or an . Ukrainian, he would probably reply that he is a peasant; and if one insisted on knowing what language he spoke, he would say that he talked &quot;the local tongue.&quot;&apos; [367 14] B
One might perhaps get him to call himself by a proper national name and say that he is &quot; russki,&quot; but this declaration would hardly yet prejudge the question of an Ukrainian relationship; lie simply does not think of nationality in the terms familiar to the intelligentsia. Again, if one tried to find out to what State he desires to belong - whether he wants to be ruled by an All-Russian or a separate Ukrainian Government  one would find that in his opinion all Governments alike are a nuisance, and that it would be best if the &quot; Christian peasant-folk &quot; were left to themselves.All the big landowners and practically the entire Christian population of the towns speak either Polish or Great Russian. There are no more Ukrainian noblemen or big landowners in the Ukraine than there are Non-Conformist noblemen in Great Britain-the Ukrainian may rise to higher rank, but he then ceases to be what his fathers were. To give but a few examples : the notorious reactionary Durnovo, the -Octobrist Rodzianko, the Cadet Terestchenko, the Bolshevik Krilenko are all obviously of Ukrainain extraction, but none of them considered or considers himself essentially different from the Great Russians. As a rule it sufficed for the Ukrainian peasant to leave his village community in order to lose his marked provincial peculiarities and bis dialect. The larger part of the tchinovniks and the school teachers and priests speak Great Russian though they are very largely Ukrainians by birth. &quot; There have been national Ukrainian commissaries,11 writes a correspondent in the &quot; Czas,&quot; &quot;but to the peasants they were as strange as the old Russian tchinovniks. ... In fact, they were mostly ex-tchiuovniks. . . . One day they hold office as Bolsheviks, the next as Ukrainians, or vice versa.&apos;&apos;1 Yet, most of them, educated in Russian schools, were-unable to do their official work in the Ukrainian language-an official circular of the Ukrainian Rada had to allow them for the time being to carry on their work in Russian. Even when going as unskilled labourers to the towns the Ukrainian peasants changed into Great Russians. One can see in the novels of Maxim Gorki or of Kuprin how these men who move freely from Odessa to the Volga, from Rostof on the Don to Petrograd, are clearly conscious of the unity of Ail-Russia. The Ukrainian nationality of the peasant in the Ukraine is linguistic to some extent, but it rests mainly on the intense class consciousness of the peasant, on the herd instinct which he feels within his village community and within his social class. He feels a hatred of the strangers who, like a visitation of God, swarm about the Ukraine-the Polish &apos; pany &quot; (lords), the Jewish traders, the Russian &quot; tchinovniks,&quot; the shady &quot; townees.&quot;&apos; At times he doubts whether even the priest, not being a peasant, can be altogether pleasing to Heaven ; as to Church land lie holds very definite views to which the village communities have given practical expression.The Ukrainian peasant instinctively believes in the right of every man to the means of production which he needs for his work, and in the right of property in the produce of labour alone, in the open, unguarded fields round every village tens of thousands of sheaves of grain stand throughout the summer and not a single sheaf is stolen. But even the most self-respecting peasant will steal wood from the landowners forest. The writer once caught a peasant cutting a tree in the forest, disarmed him, and gave him a hiding. The peasant accepted it as the natural course of events. But when called a thief, he answered that not he was the thief, but the masters. The trees in the forest and the.land in the fields were given by God to all men alike, and are as free as water and air.   They belong to him who needs them, and is able to use them.Such is the moral background of the Ukrainian peasant movement.Its material foundations are determined by the agrarian system which now prevails in Eastern Europe. There are the big landed estates, the &quot; mammoth farms,&quot; comprising what used to be the demesne in the clays of serfdom about half the land, and usually the better half, They are run as big capitalist enterprises by their owners, or by farmers who, as far as the methods of management is concerned, differ in no way from the owners. The other half of the land belongs to the peasants. As a rule, however, their holdings are not economically self-sufficient farms such as one finds in Bohemia, in most parts of Germany, and of France, and as Stolypin tried to introduce in Russia. The peasants live in clustered villages, in huts surrounded by different farm buildings, and usually with an orchard and a small garden plot attached to them. Their land lies out in the open fields, and consists of small scattered strips sometimes distant by miles from each other. When serfdom was abolished sufficient land was assigned to each peasant holding. But whilst the very organisation of the big manor prevents its sub-division among heirs, neither law nor custom nor the nature of the holding has prevented the division of the land of the peasant among his numerous children. No wonder then if fifty years after the first assignment of land most of them find them-selves with too little land to live on, or, as cottagers, with nothing more than a garden
plot. Most of them have to eke out their existence by working as hired labourers on &quot;the big landed estates,and throughout Eastern Europe now goes the cry for the &quot;extra lot,&quot; a new appropriation of land foi the peasants. Having too little land for cereals the peasants&apos; have long ago converted, most, of their meadows, commons, or forests into plough, land. They are therefore short of pasture for their cows, and of wood for fuel. The cry for the &quot;forests and meadows&quot; (&quot; lisy i pasowyska &quot;) is a more powerful political factor in the Ukraine than all national ideas put together.The Polish, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian villages know .nothing of the primitive communism which has been preserved in Great Russia, largely by the administrative arrangements of the old Muscovite State. Hence the agrarian programme in the Ukraine has not the communist character which it has in Great Russia. Difficulties are likely to arise between the richer and poorer peasants-are the big landed estates to be used to equalise their holdings, or is every one to get an equal share irrespective of how much he owns now ? But as against the big landlord they all present a united front. And here differences of religion or nationality count for nothing. There are some scattered Polish villages to be found in the Ukraine and the Cracow &quot; Czas,&quot; the organ of the high Polish Clerical aristocracy, had to admit in its issue of the 19th March that &quot; the Polish peasants grabbed the land of the &apos; pany &apos; [Polish landlords] with no less joy than the Ukrainians.&quot; This was also the reason why the Poles were so frantically afraid of a national plebiscite in Cholm, because they knew that if the Polish peasant had to choose between a Polish State in which the big landowners would be left their land (a large part of Cholm belongs to Count, Maurice Zamoyski), and an Ukrainian peasant republic in which lie would get that land without compensation, he would disregard religion and nationality and vote for the Ukraine.The Revolution gave the Ukrainian peasants an opportunity of putting their ideas into practice. As soon as they grasped that now they were masters, they seized the land of the big landowners, then their cattle and their stores; if met with resistance they applied force. Pogroms of manor houses began, frequently rendered more atrocious by the participation of soldiers from the front: Sometimes manor houses were razed to the ground by the peasants in virtue of decisions passed in the village assemblies-they imagined that by destroying them thoroughly they would insure against the return of their masters. In Podolia and Volhynia few manors have escaped destruction. A hatred pent up for centuries found vent. Kind masters fared no better than harsh ones. A peasant revolt is a class struggle in its most elemental form. A story is told in the Ukraine how in a rebellion in the days of serfdom, a master recognising among his executioners a peasant who had been his special favourite, applied to him for help. &quot; Oh, cut his throat slowly, for he was such a kind master,&quot; was the peasants response. More than harsh treatment, the Ukrainian&apos; peasant resents what he considers uncalled-for interference on the part of his master in the affairs of the village. The master, when a stranger, is to the peasant but the exponent of a hated system; but if under that system he tries to deal with the peasant in a human manner, he becomes the object of personal hatred.The break-up of the big landed estates, would no .doubt mean a very considerable economic loss to the country as a whole. Certain industries such as sugar refineries, alcohol distilleries, &amp;c, could hardly be continued under the new system. The farm establishments, wherever they survive the pogroms, would lose their usefulness they cannot be utilised in common by an entire village. Last, but&apos;not least, the-standard of agriculture would fall very considerably; illiterate peasants would take the place of trained managers equipped with up-to-date machinery. The peasant holdings in Eastern Europe succeed in combining all the technical disadvantages of agriculture on an extensive scale with those peculiar to small holdings. Yet these considerations do not matter to aland-hungry peasantry-one might.as well argue with the ocean.The political developments&apos;in the Ukraine since the revolution emerge directly from its social conditions.The peasantry, the element which alone counts in the Ukraine, has one immediate concern which is to seize the land of the big landowners. The fate of the big landowners, whether they are Poles or Russians, and of their retinue, the managers, bailiffs, &amp;c, mostly Poles by nationality, depends on coercion being applied to the peasants. What they desire is to be sa ed from their peasants, a thing which the Central Powers alone are now in a position to attempt.For national reasons the Ukrainian Nationalists favour the seizing of the big landed estates by the peasants because that would mean the transfer of land from the Polish and Great Russian gentries to the native Ukrainian peasantry and break the Polish and Great Russian influence in the Ukraine.   For the very same reason the [367-14] .   B 2
Polish Nationalists and the Russian Conservatives view that transfer with horror. The Bolsheviks and even more moderate Socialists favour the transfer on social grounds, and in so far, therefore, agree with the Ukrainian Nationalists. No doubt the Ukrainian Nationalists and the Bolsheviks differ in their ideas as to national versus private ownership of land, as to the way in which the big landed estates are to be divided, &amp;c., but neither side had any means of efficiently directing the procedure adopted in the villages, nor do the peasants bother their heads about theoretical party programmes invented by &quot;townees.&quot; They do their work according to their own lights. There should be - no mistake about this; in the absence of any proper government organisation, the upper classes in Eastern Europe, the intelli-gentsia and its politicians are mere flies on the wheel. The power or influence of the Ukrainian Radas. Lithuanian Tarybas, or Polish National Councils is exceedingly small, even of those on the spot, to say nothing of their counterparts abroad. They rise if they succeed in adjusting themselves to the circumstances of the moment; they thrive if they find a foreign government to finance them. If used as mere tools they may occasionally prove useful. But they never count at home and cannot&quot; deliver the goods,&quot; unless the desired results are produced in the chapter of events.The difference between the Ukrainian Nationalist Rada and the Bolsheviks was not so much a conflict of bourgeois and proletarian interests, as of Nationalist and Socialist ideas. The Ukrainian Nationalists desired to prevent the peasant movement in the Ukraine from merging in that of All-Russia. They wanted to bind it up with their Nationalist movement and to create ah artificial barrier between Great Russia and the Ukraine. The peasantry showing little interest in ideas peculiar to the intelligentsia, and the Bolsheviks wishing for nothing but what actually did happen, things threatened to go the Bolshevik way. Ukrainian nationalism was on the point of being submerged in the social movement. Then the Rada called in the Germans (or rather supplied them with an excuse for coming in) so that they might establish for the Rada that barrier which it could not have established by its own means. The Ukrainian Nationalists did not however expect the Central Powers to interfere in the conflict between the Polish and Great Russian landowners on the one hand and the Ukrainian peasantry on the other. They thought that the German interest in the Ukrainian movement as a means for breaking up Russia would secure them against any action of that kind. But to the Germans and Austrians the question of food was and remains of more immediate interest than the dark political future of the Ukraine. They failed to find any big stores because the manors had been destroyed and pillaged, and food in the possession of the peasants cannot easily be got at. They want, therefore, the pillaged stores to be returned, and have, moreover, to consider the problem of the coming harvest. - If the big landed estates are restored, it will be easier to cultivate the land, the work will be done much better, it will be possible to use machinery and, when the harvest is gathered, to cart it off in masses to Germany or Austria. This is one reason why the Central Powers have to try to re-establish the big landed estates.The second reason is that the agrarian Bolshevik movement threatens to spread into Austria and Poland. Such an extension can be prevented most effectively by suppressing the movement in the Ukraine itself.       . -General von Eichhorn therefore ordered the Ukrainian peasants to return the land and all machinery, stores, &amp;c, which they had appropriated to themselves to the big landowners. The Ukrainian Rada could hot possibly acquiesce in that measure. They would have lost their last chance with the peasants, and yet could never have become acceptable to the Conservative land-owning gentry. The Ukrainian national interest is social revolutionary, and if the Germans cannot put up with a social revolutionary system, they have to seek their supporters elsewhere-among the Polish upper classes or among the Great Russian counter-revolutionaries in the Ukraine.From the very outset the Germans were received with suspicion by the Ukrainian peasantry, and this was bound to be so irrespective of their intentions. Ukrainian peasants and their dogs alike treat with suspicion any one who is not dressed like a peasant-what good can come from a stranger? &quot;The German armies were sorely disappointed/&apos; wrote a correspondent in the Lemberg &quot; Kurjer Lwowski,&quot; about the 20th March, &quot; .... no proper roads ; . . . . people generally hostile, even defiant in their attitude; .... the roads swarm with soldiers returning from the front andfrequently fully armed.....,These soldiers turn on the German troops with furioushatred. .&apos;. . .&quot;If such was the attitude before they had done anything, what will it be now that, the Germans propose, not merely to take the food from the peasants and to deprive them of the land of which they consider themselves the rightful owners, but even to
compel them to work on the landed, estates for the big landowners ? The peasants will not do so of their free will, yet unless they are made to there will be no harvest for export to Germany. A measure of compulsory civilian service recently introduced in Austria was sufficient to set a rumour going among the Ukrainian peasants in East Galicia that the Government is about to re-introduce serfdom. This rumour produced serious disturbances, though East Galicia has not passed through a recent social revolution and although the peasants over there have no arms at their disposal. What the peasants in the Ukraine are capable of is best shown by the following incident.Polish troops from General MichaehVs corps had been stationed for some time past in the district of Niemirof, and high-handed proceedings on their part had drawn on them the hatred of the peasants. When the Poles attempted to requisition food serious disturbances followed, and on the 1.3th April a crowd of Ukrainian peasants, armed with anything from a machine gun to a fork, encountered three squadrons of Polish cavalry. The Poles were 600 men strong and fully armed, yet they were overwhelmed by the peasants and most of them were killed.There is a considerable difference in character between the Ukrainian and the Great Russian. The Ukrainians have a long military tradition of fierce border fighting and of peasant insurrections ; they are reared on songs about the old Cossacks and their exploits. Even the fiercest measures of coercion are not likely to break the peasant movement in the Ukraine. When a peasant has once obtained possession of the land, no power on earth can permanently deprive him of it again. When Napoleon I and the Roman Catholic Church negotiated the famous Concordat, everything could be made a matter of discussion and compromise except the ownership which the peasant had acquired in the Church lauds this had to be left untouched.But even if within certain limited districts the Germans and Austrians should succeed in cowing the peasants into apparent submission, they will yet be faced by the possibility of a sabotage which nothing can check. They may try to use harvesters, but on the first clay they may find their blades broken by small stakes placed in the thick corn where no one can detect them until it is too late. In the hot, dry season, which in the Ukraine sets in every summer, entire cornfields may be set ablaze. How to kill off the cattle and horses in a discreet way any Ukrainian peasant knows full well. And when the Ukrainian peasant has been deprived of his land and forced to work for his masters, anything may be expected irom him. If the Bolsheviks continue their sway in the adjoining parts of Russia, they will by their example, as well as by direct material support, encourage the peasants against the Germans. Yet even the downfall of the Bolshevik Government in Russia can hardly stem the tide of the peasant movement which, the Grermans will almost certainly have to face in the Ukraine. This movement ought perhaps to be considered one of the main assets which we have left in Eastern Europe an important element in the blockade.It might perhaps be worth considering (a.) Whether it is desirable for the British Government actively to encourage the agrarian movement in the Ukraine, especially with a view to the destruction of the harvest and stores on the big landed estates;(b.) If so, whether we have any means at our disposal.o
