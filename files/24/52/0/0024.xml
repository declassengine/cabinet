J71- .    -f\   I^MOHATO/I ON CERTAIN LINES OF POLICY.LU\V&apos;.&apos;-;&apos;      $he Air Force duly came into existence on tho lot April, 1918, and on my taking office on tho 1st May, no definition of policy regulating its conduct had as yet been laid down.I desire now to submit for tho approval of the War Cabinet the following observations sotting forth what I conceive to &quot;be 3omo of the main responsibilities and duties attaching to the Air Ministry at this stage of the war.In the first place, I assume that the decision of the War Cabinet to constitute the Air Ministry together with the Air General Staff was based on the conviction that the possibilities of aerial warfare and their influence on the war, might more efficiently be realised by the establishment of a single authority than by the maintenance of independent forces attached to the Havy and Army, and in particular, that a rapid development of aerial forces, devoted to the interruption of German industrial effort and kindred objects, might be achieved to such an extent as substantially to contribute towards bringing abou^ a definite demand for peace.     To attain success in this policy tho Air Ministry must therefore be recognised as the authority on air policy, and the Air Staff must command tho fullest knowledge of all methods cf the utilisation of aircraft and of their effectiveness in practice,Hitherto, practically all aerial operations and the utilisation of all aerial resources have been carried out under the orders&apos; of naval or military commanders, and to an overwhelming extent such operations have been in fields of aerial activity directly associated with naval and military efforts.   Artillery co-operation, aerial fighting, groundtarget
72h   2   &quot;I      &apos;    -target work, tactial bombing of army communications and transport at short range and photographic work, represent definite functions of aerial work associated with array operations.Tho utilisation of fighting machines carried on warships, seaplane carrier units, escort patrols, naval reconnaissance,by use of aeroplanes and seaplanes and torpedo-carrying aeroplanos, are equally definitely associated with naval operations:.On the other hand, long and extreme range bombing machines for operation by day and night, utilised for industrial targets cr military targets outside the range of army machines, such as vital main bridges,.railway stations, military campa, etc., in enemy country,,involve for their efficient utilisation considerations of operation of a purely aerial character, requiring for their concep-tion and execution a large measure of freedom and independence from other military schemes,One factor which continuously tends to complicate the true war aerial policy, arises from the ever-growing series of functions and classes of activity to which aircraft might be applied with oucess.   This results in a series of continuously growing demands on the necessarily limited aerial resources of the country.   Whether these resources are assessed in aeronautical material or in personnel, their rate of development is continuous, but in my opinion, ouch growth will not equal the rate of demand, although,fortunately, the development should take place at a greater rate than that of the   enemy5fc aerial resources.In these circumstances I submit the following proposition for approval(i)   The Air Ministry is responsible to the War Cabinet for securing that utilisation of the available aerial forces of the country which will prove most effective in its results against the enemy, whether the forcesare
-   3 -marc operated in association with the Nary or the Army or by independent Air Force Command.(ii) This responsibility involves the power of allocating the resources as between tho Ifavy, Ajsm&amp;r and Air Force operative units, and in the event of a con-flic t of opinion as to allocation arising owing to the available, resources being below- the demands of the throe authorities, the Air Ministry must be the judge, subject to appeal to the &quot;far Cabinet.(iii) I propose as an immediate and practical measure, subject to modification in accordance with war developments, that the problem of allocation be settled as follows:-(a)   For each Air Force Group (ouch as that under the Field Marshal Comraander-in-Chief, Franco, or that attached to the vice-Admiral Commanding Dover Patrol) there shall be agreed a minimum permanent establishment, the strength of which will not be reduced without reference to the &apos;-7ar Cabinet.(b)   Further, for each of those Groups there shall be an agreed development programme, but the additional resources made available by the execution of this programme will be controlled by the Air Ministry.

22.5,18,-MBMOBAMOT.. ON INDEPENDENT AIR FORCE CjpvIAND^Following on my memorandum of...........................................inotant&quot; dealingwith main policy of the Air Ministry, I desire the support and assistance of tho War Cabinet in regard to the arrangements necessary for carrying out tho progressive development of long range bombing of GermanyiWhile I am strongly convinced of the effectiveness of long-range bombing on German civilian morale and on limitation of indus-trial effort, it is equally clear that we must now obtain as much preliminary experienco as possible of the use of aircraft for this purpose, so that such summer and autumn experience may be embodied in our preparations for the strongest possible spring.-offensive.A   review of the present arrangements in France and America discloses that we must rely on our own efforts during the summer and autumn of this year.   Accordingly, after careful considera-tion and consultation with General Smuts, General Troncnard has been appointed as General Officer Commanding the Independent Force, R.A.F. (Long Range Bombing Force).   I desire to emphasise the import-ance of this step, inasmuch as it represents the first independent Air Force Command yet created in any country.At present the Force under General Trenchard&apos;a Command iscomparatively small, comprising 4 squadrons, one of which is ejtpresent incomplete, but arrangements are well in hand to bring thislbForce up to at least 3&amp; squadrons by the end of October, and the most energetic steps are now being taken to assure this strength.The Force will be so constituted as to provide machines for day and night bombing over a fairly wide range of Rhine towns, while at the same time it is probable that a small force of except tional machines will be put at General Trenchard&apos; s disposal capable of bombing any of the Rhine towns and also Westphalian towns, such as Essen,When
When the Force has reached the strongth indicated, it will be possible, , apart from weather limitations, to carry on continuous day and night bombing.It is intended to develop the Force to a much larger extent by next Spring, in particular by the provision of very power&quot; ful day bombing machines with fitting escorts, there being a strong presumption that this course of action will cause Germany to take the normal defensive measures of provision of fighting machines and of anti-aircraft guns for home defence.I desire to emphasise the definite character of those proposals and the heaviness of the blow which may be anticipated. At the same time, such a proposal to achieve success, would entail the complete and thorough co-operation of America and of France, together with their full sympathy and support.It is possible that Franco may not view these proposals with enthusiasm on account of their belief that intensive   bombing of German towns will result in similar activity by Germany against French towns,   I am strongly convinced that Germany will carry out the maximum amount of bombing possible of French and British towns apart altogether from any action taken by us, and.it should be pointed out to France that our arrangements will comprise much more intensive bombing of Germany than it is anticipated the ane.jy can direct against the Allies.Further, it is probable that objections will be raised by tne French to the Independent Command of this Bombing Force, and strong claims will be put forward that such a Force should ultimately be under the Command of the Generalissimo, General Foch,   1 would represent most strongly the possible dangers of such an arrangement and would point out the necessity of supporting the independence of this Command to a similar degree as a naval command.Any
Any representations of the Generalissimo to the effect that the military situation at any given time requires the co-operation of heavy bombing forces, would receive every considera tion, but independence of action must be secured, otherwise the risk will be run that purely Army needs mifjit interfere with the policy of continuous bombing already set forth.Accordingly, I would ask the War Cabinet to put before the Supreme War Council at as early a date as possible, tho following propositions(a) Confirmation of the Independent Long Range Bombing Command.(b) Its ultimate development into an Inter-A3.l.1 eel Commandunder a British General Officer Commanding.,so long as the British portion of the Command.is the larger.( c)      ht Clemenceau to obtain the support of the French Army Authorities to !chis scheme.
The pooition as to American Aviation is still unsatisfactory In most of its aspects.   With the oxception of tho Agreements for 15,000 mechanics to be under training in this- country, and for tho formation of 30 Bandloy-Page squadrons there arc practically no clear cut propositions in hand.At tho present time there arc in America three Services dealing with Aviation, namely, the Navy$ the Marines and tho Army-.   Their roquiromonts as to policy, formation of units, training and production do not appear to bo co-ordinated in any way. They are constantly overlapping. Similar questions are asked and awswored for each one of those three sections *To enable tho full power of an Allied Air offensiveto be realised in 1919 it appears to bo absolutely essentialthat the basic handling of all Air matters in America shouldbe on a clearly defined basis *   This undoubtedly points to-*(1)   The nocessity for the formation&apos;of an American Air Staff, to be sub-divided broadly on the linos of the Air Ministry, and(2)   That definite and clear co-ordination shouldbe arrived at between tho British Air Ministry and the American Air Staff, when formed.To arrive at the co-ordination -mentioned above, It would appear to be most desirable for a few officers of this Air Staff to be located in London,   By this means all programmes could bo worked out between the two nations, so that each nation carries out that portion of the work entailed in the 1919, and future, programmes,, as is best suited to Its facilities for production, training, etc, due account being taken of difficulties of transport and oroction.Until such time as the foregoing proposals are put into effect it would appear that finality will never be reached in any one particular, as all the various Services and the sub-branches of work In these Services, will continue to run on parallel lines.
proposals aro recommended(a) That the American War Staff located In London, above referred to, should consist of senior officers whoso functions would he to come, to definite decisions with the British and Frenoh Air Staffs, and with power to send definite instructions to America on matters agreed upon,(b) That, aftor providing for tho minimum requirements of tho British and American Armies In France, tho balanoe of the combined resources of both countrlos should be thrown Into Long Rango Strategic Bombing, large Flying Boats for Anti^ oubmarino purposes, and the nccossary protecting aircraft for both,or that alternatively and preferably to (b)(o)   That the British resources (apart from personnel) should be used to supply tho requirements of both the American and British Armies in Franco, and that tho American resources (other than for training in America) should be devoted to largo aircraft for strategic bombing, anti-submarine work and protective aircraft.(d) That In cither of the above alternatives the existing engine programme should be adhered to, and further engine programmes developed In accordance with service requirements.(e) That a British mission of experts should immediately bo sent tc Washington ts explain this In further detail to the American Authorities and to support Lord Reading in bringing about the necessary action.-
