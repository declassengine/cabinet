(Prepared in accordance with&apos; iVar Cabinet 415,Minute 11*)If His Majesty/s- Government decide to conclude an   agreement with Germany on the&apos; lines of that recently concluded between Germany and France, the. most, important, consequences would be approximately as: follows:- ,QfJilBATiNTa. - ;:ATT non^oommissiCB - officers and&apos; men; who have been in captivity for over 18 months would be exchanged on a man-for-man , basis, and the numbers involved would bo abput 35,000 on each side*Officers, (who already benefit tinder the 18 months provision) would, with certain exceptions-,remain, as now,, interned in a neutral country*      .The total number &quot;of German combatant prisoners in our hands both here and in Prance,is about 124,000, besides a few detained in Egypt and the Dominions, ,The number of British combatant prisoners-., in German handsat the present moment Is believed to be/130,000,.over .CIVILIANS^111 civilians,, whether interned or uninterned, would be repatriated, should they so desire, and it may be assumed that the uninterned Germans,- if permitted, Will, remain here and in the Dominions rather than return to Germany,v : .   There are 2&amp;,000 German civilians interne&apos;&apos;, here;; about 10&apos;000 Interned in the Dominions, and about 4,000 British civilians interned in Germany,Hitherto it has been found impracticable to consider the repatriation of the Germans interned in the Dominions, and up to the present, proposals for exchange have been confined to those persons who are interned in England and Germany respectively,   TIb advantages and disadvantages of such an exchange have beenfrequently discussed,   .. yIn negooiating with the Germans it ought to be possibleto&apos; utilise this large balance of civilians as a means of extractingadvantages in other directions, such as for&apos; instahoe the insistanceupon certain conditions demanded, by the Admiralty,.Neither:combatants nor civilians&apos; exchanged or repatriated   . under such an agreement-would, be available for servioe in the field or on the&apos;lines of communication.It should be borno in mind that; whatever may be the nature of the Agreement oonoluded,its actual operation must Inevitably be s* slow,owing to difficulties of transport, that It could have no immediate effect on the course of the war,. Nearly six months&apos; elapsed between the ratification of the Hague Agreement and the firstifransfer of prisoners,whilst It has not been found possible under existing conditions, to&apos;exchange as many as 3,000 on each side per month.    It is obvious therefore that an exchange on a large scale must extend over a very prolonged period.If an agreement of this character Is concluded with Germany, Kis Majesty1s Government Will no doubt be pressed to conclude similar agreements with Turkey,. Bulgaria and Austria; the numbers involved are comparatively insignificant; about 8,000 in the case of Turkey, and some hundreds only as regards the other two Powers,.NEWTON,.Prisoners of War&apos;Department,Royal Court, House of Lords* ..
