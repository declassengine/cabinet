w. c.1245&apos; i If$f        *r Political Intelligence Department,OiTFIPTOIATi.      &apos; faw&quot;        fv^ Foreign Office,y;y 25th,  1918.Denmark /OOK.II E 1.1 0 R A a D U H on the DAHISH   ELECTIONS. The elections to the new Landting (Ueoer House) took place on the 1th of May.     The Government Parties (Radicals and Socialists in ombination) secured 28, the Liberals and Conservatives 44 seats...   In he former landting the respective figures were 12 and 54*     The com-larative strengthening of the position of the Government- is princi-II ally due to the fact that the number of electors who went to the ooll n the urban districts, whose votes favoured the Radical and Socialist parties - a tribute to the efforts of the present Government to ensure heap food supplies to the people, - was relatively greater than in he country districts were the votes went principally to the &quot;Left&quot;, he agriculturists thus expressing their dissatisfaction at the fixing If maximum prices and the introduction of expert restrictions and other easures which were opposed to their interests,The comparative strength of the parties in the Landting, however, lays no great role in Danish politics as the position of the Govern-lent is not affected by an adverse vote in this House.In the new Folketing (Lower House) the elections at the end of pril gave the present Government a majority of 2 in a house of 140 lembers compared with a majority of 12 in &quot;the old Folketing, consisting if 114 members.     It would seem that this set-back will not materially ffect the position of the present Government though it is probable that lome form of co-operation with the other parties will have to be rranged.     However this may be, since all Danes maintain that Danish leutrality in the strictest sense of the word is essential to Denmark&apos;s lei fare, it is very unlikely that the Government policy vis-a-vis the/belligerents.
lelligeronts will undergo any change.     It is, nevertheless, a little llisquieting to find that the number of Socialist seats in the Folkoting fas increased from 38 to 39,     It is true that the Socialists do-not ppear to wish to claim more than one place in the Ministry, - Stauning, he present &quot;Control&quot; Minister without portfolio, is practically cer-flain to remain - yet the increased proportion of Socialist members in he Radical-Socialist combination may result in fche Socialists exer-ising a greater influence than hitherto, - an undesirable prospect, ince the only, people in Denmark with pronounced pro-German leanings ire the leaders of the Socialist, warty.     From information received, I would.appear that the Radicals, especially Herr Ove Rode, Minister f the Interior, seem gradually to be coming to some extent under the affcuence of Socialist ideas in domestic politics. The Radicals obtained a gain oi one seat in the Folketing - 31 32.     It should be noted, however, that with regard to its propor-lon of the total number of votes cast, this party has made greater (^ogress than any other.     Reckoning on the precentage basis it has i the present Folketing election^ polled 21 as compared to 10.7 at e last elections, the respective figures of the other parties being: cial-Democrats 28.,7 to 89.65    &quot;Left&quot; 29.4. to 29,1;    and Conservc-ves 18.3 to 22.,6.   The Conservatives, it will be noted, although&apos; ey have increased the number of their seats from 7 to 22, show the rst percentage figures, absolute and above all comparative. The   x^olketing election results were undoubtedly adversely affected om the governmental point of view by an electioneering move of the emier, Kerr Sahle.     Having stated in an interview that he wished see Mr. Hortensen, Radical Folketing member for the Faroe Islands, elected and that he would welcome the re-election to the Landting a member with similar views, he telegraphed the interview to Herr Itter, the Cove rumen t representative in the Faroe Islands, asking to give a copy of the telegram to Mr. Mortensen.     The former,/who had

The   Fclketing election results were undoubtedly adversely affected Jom the governmental noint of view by an electioneering move of the emier,&apos; Kerr Sahle.     Having stated in an interview that he wished . see tfr. Mortensen, Radical Folketing member for the Faroe Islands, (-elected and that he would welcome the re-election to the Landting a member with similar views, he telegraphed the interview to Herr tter, the Covernment representative in the Faroe Islands, asking H to give a codv of the telegram to I-.tr. Hortensen.     The former,/who had
I 2*47who hud had a serious difference of opinion with the latter, whom he had accused of approaching the British Government with a view to wsecuring supplies of foodstuffs for the Islands behind the hack of the Danish Government, promptly asked to be transferred to another post.     As soon as this became public in Copenhagen, the matter was taken up in the Landting and a vote of censure on the Premier was nassed by 38 votes to 9, for having in his official capacity as Minister of Justice responsible for the administration of the Islands, attempted to influence the elections.On the other hand, the chances of the Opposition were prejudiced by the fact that it had split up into no less than six parties, one of which only - the Traders&apos; Association - succeeded in securing a seat, whereas the Socialists and Radicals having agreed to combine so as not to split the Government vote, were able to bring their full voting power to bear.It is true that the formal alliance concluded between the Radicalsand Socialists led to the breaking away from the Socialist Party ofa Syndicalist group and that, in addition, an &quot;independent&quot; Socialistgroup has lately been formed.     The origin of the latter is directlydue to the pro- German policy of the Socialist leaders, as is evidenceby the severe criticism to which the unneutral attitude of Stauningand Borgbjerg is almost daily subjected in its organ &quot;Dagens Ekko&quot;,which first appeared a couple of months ago.     It remains to be seenwhat influence this new group will wield among the Danish Socialists.The Danish workmen are^on the whole not pro-German so there is somenewhope that the/group will prove a thorn in the side of the old Soeial-ists.   So far, however, neither this nor the Syndicalist group have yet had time to muster their forces for efficient action and were, consequently, not sufficiently powerful to exercise any real influence in the elections which have just taken place, the most marked feature of ^hich has undoubtedly been the success of the old Socialists and in a lesser degress of the Radicals, principally due to their superior organisations. &apos;
