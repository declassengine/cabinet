(This Document i3 the Property of Hie Britannic Majesty&apos;o Government).j BO B E T. .WSAGZl, WAR CABINET,DRAFT STATEMENT III REGARD TO IRISH ARRESTS.The revolutionary movement in Ireland which culminated in tho arrest of a considerable number of persons last week con-sis ted of two closely related series of activities(a) The attempts of the German Government to foment rebellion in Irelandjand y&apos;(b) The preparations made in Ireland to carry those attempts into action/The story of the active connection between the Leaders of the Sinn Fein movement and the Germans, as disclosed by dooiiments in the possession of the British Government, falls into two parts      the period prior to, and the period sinco, the abortive Irish Rebellion of Easter 1916.   The events of the first period can be told with some fullness, but the se-cond period, which concerns recent events, permits of no more than a sketch, as a full statement would disclose the names of persons who stood by the Government, and also the channels of communication through which the German Government was act-ing, and which it would not be in the public interest to re-veal at present.I.The story begins as early in the war as November 6th, 1914, when Herr Zimmermann transmitted through Count Bernsdorff a message from Casement asking that a messenger, if possible a native born American, be sent to Ireland with the word that everything was favourable.   He was to carry no letter for fear of arrest.   Casement also asked that an Irish priest should be sent to Germany with the assistance of the German Legation in Norway to work in prison camps and corrupt Irish prisoners of war.   This priest was a certain Father John T. Nicholson, an American citizen of Irish birth.   He reached Ger-raany safely and we find him in January 1915 transmitting mea-sages to America.   According to a report of Captain von Papon
-dated December 5th, 1914, the verbal assurances sent in re:s-ponse to Casement&apos;s request have produced an excellent impre3-&apos;sion in Ireland.In the beginning of 1916 the plot ripened..   On the 10th of February of that year Count Bernsdorff sent to a covering address in Rotterdam a despatch signed with the name of Skal, one of his principal Mexican agents.   This despatch included an extract from a report of John Devoy, the Head of the Glan-na-G-ael, to the effect that action in Ireland could not be postponed much longer since he feared the arrest of the Leaders. It had been decided, he said, to begin action on Easter Satur-day, and he urged that the arms and munitions must be in Lim-erick by that date.   Later in the same month Count Bernsdorff, following his usual practice, Surreptitiously attached to a message to Berlin passed, by the American Government, a note fixing Easter Saturday for the rising and urging the despatchv\of munitions in time.On March 4th von Jagow replied that the arms would be landed in Tralee Bay, and asked that the necessary arrangements should be made in Ireland through Devoy.   On March 14th Berns-dorff replied that the Irish agreed and that full details were being sent to Ireland by&apos; messenger.   Eext day Bernsdorff tele-graphed a code to be used betweon the Germans and the rebels while the arms were in transit, and explained that a submarine might safely enter Dublin Bay and go as far as the Pigeon House -without encountering nets. \On March 26th von Jagow replied that the anas ::ould li &apos;sent and that a special code word would be used every nigh4 asan introduction to the German Wireless Press Service.   In cx n:message from Bernsdorff to Berlin the Germans were assured 1that there were numerous private wireless receiving stationsiin Ireland.On the 18th and 19th of April urgent messages were sen^ from America to Berlin, fixing the delivery of the arms for tl?f; -evening of  aster Sunday, pressing&apos;for the landing of German   .
troops aad asking for an air raid, on England and a naval at-taok on the English coast,   Hiese attacks actually took place between the 24th and 86th April.   It was the declared hope of the rebels and their German and American friends to blockade-the Irish ports against England and establish bases in Ire- .. land for German submarines,The rebellion broke out a day later than the schedule on Easter Monday, April 24th, but, as the world is aware, the German support had miscarried and it ended in complete failure.The fieport of the Royal Commission on the Rebellion in Ireland stated: rtIt is1 now a matter of common notoriety that the Irish Volunteers have been in communication with the auth-orities in Germany and were for a long time known to be sup-plied by money through Irish-r American societies.   This was so stated in public by Mr. John McKeill   on the 8th November, 1914.   It was suspected long before the outbreak that some of the money came from German sources.&quot;   The evidence on this subject in the possession of the British Government provides the clearest proof of these suspicions..II.It became clear very soon after the rising that the Sinn Fein Leaders were again asking Germany for help.   On June 17th there was a message from Berlin to Washington referring to &quot;A259 of 6th May&quot; (a message which is missing) and saying that Germany was perfectly ready to give further help if the Irish would only say what sort of help they required.   On June 16th Bernsdorff had already sent a despatch giving an, account o&amp; the rebellion as far as his information went,and stating that  1,000 had been provided.for the defence of Casement. On July  5th he sent a long message giving further news from Ireland and explaining that the work of reorganising the re-bels was making good progress and that their lack of money had been remedied by him.
On September 8th- in a despatch-iw&quot;3ex1Jja.^he^noaoB^dwf&apos; memorandum lrtm^pe?.B0a:-&apos;can.ecriTM.-sh-- Rerolution Director Resident in America&quot;, - which ^ont3lned.-deta^ .a fresh rising.   Any rising, says the Irish Revolution Direc-tor, must be contingent upon the sending by Germany of &quot;an expedition with a sufficient military force to cover the landing.&quot;   On this new occasion the German Government was to fix the time and as an inducement the advantage of having sub-marine and Zeppelin bases-in tho tfest of Ireland was insisted upon.Count Bernsdorff was evidently having difficulty with his tools, for on 24th October he warned his Government not to al-low a certain Captain Boehm, then Resident in Rotterdam, to write to Irishmen in America, -since his letters were apt to go to the wrong people.   Later Captain Boebra was arrested by usV in British waters.On December 4th we find Count Bernsdorff again attaching surreptitiously a note to a message passed by the American Government, in which he mentioned that the Irish leaders in    -America were pressing for an answer to their proposal of Sept-ember 8th,   He seems to have followed this on Christmas Day with-a message which is missing, for on the last day&apos; of 1916 Herr 2immerroann informed him of the quantities of munitions which It was proposed, to land between February 21st and 85th, 1917.   He added&apos; that it was, impossible to&quot; send German troops. On January 18th, 1917, Bernsdorff replied that his Irish Oom-mittee declined the proposal as without German troops a rising would be useless,.After AmericaTs entrance into the War on 4th&apos; April, 1917, the line of communication between the German Government and the Leaders .of the Sinn Fein party was, temporarily broken, though there is no reason to believe that the messenger service do-vised by John Devoy between America and Ireland was affected, A clue to the new line was obtained in tho autumn of 1917, and
was actively followed up.   The effect of this new line inIreland was visible in the speeches of tho Sinn Fein Leadersduring this period.   ?or example, de Valora, addressing thoConvention of Irish Volunteers on 27th October, 1917, said:-&quot;He would never-advocate another Hebellion without hopeful chances of suocoss.   They could see no hope of that in tho near future, ezcopt through a German v   invasion of England, and the landing of troops and munitions in Ireland,   They should be prepared to leave nothing undone towards that end.&quot;For some considerable time it was difficult to obtain accur-ate^Information as to the German-Sinn Fein plans, but aboutApril 1918, it was definitely ascertained that the plan forlanding arms in Ireland was ripe for execution, and that theGermans only awaited definite information from Ireland as tothe time, place, and date.   The British authorities wereable to warn the Irish Command regarding the probable landingof an agent from Germany from a submarine.   The agent aotual-ly landed on 12th April, and was arrested.   The new risingdependsd largely upon the landing of munitions from submarinesand there is evidence to show that it was planned to follow asuccessful German offensive in the West and to take place ata time when Great Britain would be presumably stripped of troops.According to documents found on his person, de Valera badworked out in great detail the constitution of his rebel army,and hoped to be able to muster half a million trained men.There is evidence that German munitions were actually shippedon submarines at Ctxhaven at the beginning of May, and thatfor some time German submarines had been busy off the Westooast of Ireland on other errands than the destruction ofAllied shipping.It will thus be seen that negotiations between the execu-tJve of the Sinn Fein organisation and Germany have been virt-ually continuous for three and a half years.   At first a section
of the Irish-Auierioisns&apos; was the laterraediary for moot of th* discussions, but,since America1s entrance into the War oommun-ioations with the enemy have tended to be more direct.   A socond rising in Ireland was planned for last year, and, the scheme broke down only because Germany was unable- to send troops.   This year plans for another rising were matured and a new shipment of arms from.Germany was imminent.   An import-ant feature in every plan was the establishment of submarine bases in Ireland to menace the shipping of all nations. In these circumstances no other course was open to&apos;the Govern-ment, if useless bloodshed was to be avoided, and its duty to the Allies fulfilled, but to intern the Leaders of this criminal intrigue.Z, miltehal 1 Gardens, S.
