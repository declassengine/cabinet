If it is with-drawn from cropping, without the provision e.  any substitute, production 2,s nscesearily decreased by, ffay-, three weeks pupply. 550,000 acres should, therefore, be a&amp;cUd to tte 11,000,COO acres now under tillage&apos; in order to ensure as high a  eduction of foodstuffs in 1919 as in 1918.    This, area could be provided as follows:-Acres.(a) 180,000  already scheduled in the oourse of the survey forthe 1918 programme and ordered to be ploughed in the present summer-;(b) 120,,000  to be reclaimed and made available for ploughingby drainage Bohemes undertaken by* the Government.(c) 250,000  to be seleoted and echeduled by the CountyAgricultural Executive Committees in England and M Wales.Total    550,000As regards labour *    this in Durance., programme re^uire-s^--(l) the replacement of the 30^000 men, now being taken for the Army by at least an equal number of German Prisoners and National&apos; Servioe Volunteers;(2) 3,000 Prisoners for drainage work;(3) for cultivation of 550,000 acres of grassland to be ploughed:.-&apos;3,000 skilled workmen in autumn. 2,500      w &quot;        &quot; spring.8,000 unskilled   &quot;       &quot; spring and eurnmer.,Total       13,500   labourersIn addition casual labour would be neoessary during harvest(2)      The second and larger programme aims at Increasing supplies of home-grown food.

This addition would provide about. B weeks&apos; supply of bread-stuff n, of which 2 weeks would be net gain (making 42 weeks in all) and would save shipping to the extent of about 870,000 tons.As regards labour - this programme of increase would require:-.(1)   the replacement of the 50,000 men now &quot;being taken for the A:?&apos;?.y &quot;by an e^ual number of prisoners and National Service Volunteers;(2)   3,000 prisoners of war for drainage works;&apos;*(3)   for cultivation of 1,000,000 acres of grass land to be ploughed3,400 skilled workmen in autumn 6,600     &quot; &quot;       &quot; spring15,0^0 unskilled   H       * spring and summer24,000 labourers Xn addition oaaual iabour would &quot;be necessary during harvest, -Legislation,In either ease legislation is neoosaary to extend the pompulsory powers of the Board under the Defence of the ReaHa Act fer one year &quot;beyond the period fixed for the expiration of those powere by the Com Production Act, namely, August 20th, 1918,Even if both programmes are rejected &quot;by the-Cabinet,        mm* legislation still remains necessary, in order -(1) that 800,000 allotment holders may retain the possession ef -their holdings, which has been promised them&apos;by Gorernnent,and(2) that the English and Scottish Boards of Agriculture may retain possession of the land which they have entered on and are cultivating under.the Defence&apos;of the Realm Aot,The demand for more war allotments is so widespread, and the resulting increase of food is so valuable, that legislation would also be necessary to enable the demand to be satisfied by action as prompt as action under the Defence of the Realm Act,    Such    legislation opens a iwider field for discussion than a mere extension of the period of enat year to two years referred to above,.The questions for the Cabinet, to consider are:-&apos; (1) whether the legislation shall take the form of an extension of tjae Board1 s powers for one year,&apos;, which would enable the.Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to seoure the compulsory ploughing of either 2p0,000 additional acres of grass, or 700,000 additional acres of grass, ap, may be found to be practicable, and have a corresponding result in Scotland, or(2) whether legislation in the direction indicated should be limited to the retention and provision of war allotments and the retention of the land of which the English and Scottish Boards are already in possession.Drafts of the Bills to carry out these alternative proposals are attached,     (See Appendix),4R, E, PROTHERO. -May 27th, 1918.
