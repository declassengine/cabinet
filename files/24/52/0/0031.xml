CONFIDENTIAL. (May&quot; 6th&apos;/ TB13)Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Offioe.AUSTRIA/004.1,1 E M ORAHDU MonTHE   HABSBURG   POLICY.The question whether or not the Austrian Emperor was sincere when writing his letter to Prince Sixte de Bourbon, whether he has done so with the approval of the Germans or, as recent events seem to suggest, without their knowledge, will be a matter of great interest for Charles&apos;s future biographer, but is a matter of indifference to those concerned with the war.     It is of no importance what Charles may have thought or wished, unless he was able to give effect to his ideas.The only thing which it was in his power to do was to start peace negotiations; the last word in them would have been with the Germans.He could not have satisfied the national demands of Austria-Hungary1 s neighbours - Italy, Serbia, Roumania and the Ukraine.He could not have secured even any decent measure of self-government for the nationalities in Austria-Hungary other than the Germans, Magyars and Poles - it is beyond his power to change the Internal configuration and constitution of his possessions.Without meeting the unsatisfied claims of either Austria-Hungary&apos; s neighbours or nationalities, he obviously could not detach Austria-Hungary from Germany.It is for the military expert to say whether, assuming un-questioning obedience to the Emperor on the part of the Austro-Hungarian generals and of the German and Magyar regiments, he could have disentangled his troops from those of Germany.    I limit myself to the purely political aspect of the question.The first aim of every national movement Is national union in
- ?, -a sovereign state.     Of the eight nationalities whioh inhabit Austria-Hungary the Magyars and Czeeho-Slovaks alone have no national States or settlements beyond the borders of the Habsburg Monarchy.     The Germans, Italians, Jugo-slavs, Rumans, Ukrainians and Poles inhabiting Austria-Hungary have seen national States of their own grow up on the other side of the frontier, and con-versely every single State bordering on Austria-Hungary sees un-redeemed national territory of its own included in it.     There are but few of the national nondescripts who, attached to the Habsburg dynasty by ties of sentiment and personal interest, would supoort them irrespective of the policy which they might adopt towards the different nationalities, within the State and towards its neighbours.     Feudal aristocrats, princely bishops, high government officials, a small group of professional army families, and lastly a part of the Vienna populace which, as -80 often occurs in the case of capitals, conceives itself associated with the dynasty in the ownership of subject lands and peoples, are the main exponents of the Habsburg Staatsideo.,     The others, who form a.vast majority within the Habsburg Monarchy, require further reason why they should remain part of it rather than be included in their own national State; . and again for the States bordering on the Habsburg Monarchy the prescriptive right of a dynasty would hardly be suffioient reason for acquiescing in the continued division of their national territory.The Habsburg interest is purely dynastfo,. proprietary.     Their desire is to possess - to retain that which they possess and to acquire.     They will favour any national movement which tends to preserve or to increase their possessions, oppose any which tends to diminish them.Of some nationalities the union cannot be realised within the Habsburg dominions.     Thus it is inconceivable that the whole of
Italy or of the Ukraine, unlikely that the whole of Roumania, should ever pass under their sceptre.     The Italian, Ukrainian and Roumanian national movements cannot therefore he reconciled with the dynastic interests of the Habsburgs.Of the national ideas which can be realised mnder the Habsburg rule some are non-competing, and some are opposed to each other. The German interest is compatible with that of the Magyars and within the Habsburg possessions even with that of the Poles, nor does any fundamental difference of interests separate the Poles from the Magyars.     With one or two insignificant corrections the frontiers which exist between western Austria, Hungary and Galicia correspond to the national , strategical and economic interests of these three races.All Czecho-Slovak land is comprised within the Habsburg dominions-. -     Their national unity could therefore be achieved within its territorial borders.     This would however break up German unity in Austria and would create an alien Slav State in between Vienna, Munich, Dresden and Breslau,     Nor can the Czecho-Slovak national aims be reconciled with the integrity of Hungary.lTost of the Jugo-Slav territories are included within the Habsburg Monarchy.     A very considerable measure of Jugo-Slav national unity might therefore be achieved within its borders, but again German and Magyar national claims and interests would have to be disregarded.Thus the Czech and Jugo-Slav national programmes are not incompatible with the interests of the Habsburgs dynasty, but are incompatible with the national programme of the Germans and MagyarsThe Habsburgs can obtain the support of one only of the two groups.     No other combinations are possible between these four nationalities.
In Oalieia the claims and interests of the Poles and Ukrainians are opaosed to each other..    The interests of the Ukrainians con-&quot;fliot also with those of tho Magyars.     The interests of the Poles nowhere in Austria-Hungary conflict with those of the Magyars and the Germans.     Hence the  5oles have usually to he added to the German Magyar group, the Ukrainians to that of the Czechz and -Tugo-Slavs,     The connection of Galicia with Austria-Hungary being of a casual and external nature, the position of its two nation-alities within the groups is less permanent.Like mercury on a glass plate, the Habsburg Honarchy has moved over the map of Europe.     Rational States have arisen on its borders with claims against it.     It has seen them arise one by one - Germany and   Italy, Serbia and Roumania, each of them a threat and a problem.     But   what had been left of the Habsburg inheritance in 1867 was not altogether amorphous.     The residue of their dynastic possessions coincided with the historic inheritance of the Magyar nation and of the Austrian Germans, and with part of the historic inheritance of the &quot;^oles, none nationally pure, each based on an imperialist claim and on violence against other nations.     When recognised as heirs and masters in their own imperialist preserves, the German, Magyar and Polish nation-alists acquire an interest as keen as that of the Habsburgs themselves in defending the frontiers of their dynastic possessions against their neighbours - Italy, Serbia. Roumania and Russia. The ,C3echo-Slova*ks can never feel much interest for the Trentino or Transylvania, and they sympathise with Russia and -jerbia. The Jugo-Slavs can never be trusted altogether because even com-plete the union within the Habsburg Monarchy would not complete the union of their nation.This is the first reason why the German Magyar group is the more natural ally of the Habsburgs than its Slav rivals could ever be.
Germany alone among the neighbours of the Habsburg Monarchy is prepared to forego claiming her unredeemed territories - but on conditions,     &quot;To federalise Austria,&quot; said Julius Andrassy to the Emperor Faancis Joseph in July 1866, &quot;would mean not merely to estrange the whole of Hungary&quot;(he meant all the Magyars) from the Monarchy, but also to destroy the foremost foundations of theMonarchy.........The Germans in it woujd be deprived of theirhistoric mission, i.e,, of their mission within the Monarchy, $hen the cry of pain of the German provinces would soon be heard in Berlin or Munich, as the cry of the Italian provinces was heard at Florence,&quot;     The historic mission of the Austrian Germans, as they conceive it, is to rule Austria.     The great mass of them does not raise -the&quot; ory of pain&quot;, nor does Germany hear it, as long as Austria remains German.     An inclusion of Western Austria in Germany would have disturbed the balance between north and south, between the Protestants and the Catholics, and would have burdened Germany with national struggles and frontier conflicts which it is much more convenient to neutralise in a separate state.&apos;     Last but not least, a German Austria united to a Magyar Hungary raises Germany&apos;s power and vastly expends her influence .     &quot;A break-ftp of Austria would mean the isolation of Germany&quot;, wrote in the spring of 1915 Herr Karl Iro, a fanatical Pan-German who pre-viously demanded that Austria should be broken..up and her Western Provinces should be included in the German Empire.     &quot;The Pan-Germans in Austria have no longer a programme;   we rwish for Austria&apos;s existence because it is of vital necessity to Germany&quot;. Germany and the German Austrians will thus agree to the continued existence of the Habsburg Monarchy provided it preserves its German-Magyar character.The Germans, Magyars and Poles together have proved sufficiently
strong to keen down their opponents within the Habsburg Monarchy.. 4Ehe German alliance has so far proved a sufficient safeguard against Austria-Hungary&apos;s neighbours.     No other combination within the Habsburg&apos;&apos; doMMon could supply the dynasty with equal safeguards.     The Italians, Little Russians (Ukrainians) and Rumans cannot realise their national unity within the Habsburg Monarchy, nor can they, living on its outskirts, in comparatively small numbers, find a compensation in influencing   its foreign policy for the benefit of their own national States, as the Germans do.     The Czechs and Jugo-Slavs could not supply the dynasty with any foreign alliance fitr to safeguard the integrity of its territorial possessions.This is the second reason why the German-Magyar group is a more suitable ally for the Habsburgs than its Slav rivals ever could be.Dominion of one nation over another exeroised in the past\ usually means social and economic predominance in the present.. It is the most dangerous complication if the upper classes of one nationality extend over the land of the other.     Such was the position of the English in Ireland before the Land Acts - but there is no other nation of which the conservative upper classes are capable of the sacrifice made by those Acts.     Such is at the present day the foundation of German dominion in the Baltic provinces over the Ests and Letts, of Magyar dominion over the non-Magyar races of Hungary, of Polish dominion over East Galicia and of the Polish imperialist claims to dominion over the other parts of the Western Ukraine and over Lithuania and White Russia. Such also was, and to some extent remains even now, the foundation of German predominance in the Czech and Slovene provinces of Austria.
All the big landed estates in Oflicia are owned by Pole3, all - the big landed estates in Hungary by Magyars.     In a Polish QcuLLoia and a Magyar Hungary the powers in Chftrch and State with all their-strength cup-port the dominion of the landed nobility and gentry over the peasants;   in a self-governing Ozecho-Slovak, Jugo-Slav, Ukrainian or Ruman State the peasants would he top dogs.Excepting the Czechs these are peasant nations with no aristo-cracy and hardly any middle classes of their own;   the intelligent-sia which they possess * priests, doctors, barristers etc, -are of peasant extraction, closely united with the peasants in sentiments and interests.     Luring the last fifty years the Czechs have developed a rich and strong bourgeoisie, but with it an even much stronger, highly educated, industrial proletariat.     ffihey are socially the most radical nationality in Austria. &apos;   When in 1848 the Habsburgs invoked the help of the Czechs and Slovenes, of the Slovaks, Croats, Serbs and Rumans, and of the little Russians (Ukrainians) against the Germans, Magyars and Poles, they appealed to peasants for help against their masters;   they in fact for the time being encouraged and led a social revolution, fortunately for them a movement which was social revolutionary in sentiment but was practically without a social programme..     Once the Habsburgs had conquered their noble and bourgeois opponents, they had to coerce their own peasant allies to prevent them from drawing conclusions from their victory.     &quot;What you receive for punishment,&quot; said a.Croat to a Magyar about 1850, &quot;we receive for our reward.&quot;     In 1867, of all the nationalities in the Habsburg Monarchy, the Germans, Magyars and Poles alone had,    upper and . middle clashes fit to carry on a socially conservative, constitu-tional regime.     Even at the present day these three nationalities alone can safeguard a socially conservative regime within the I Habsburg Monarchy - their nationalisms are conservative in their
^fouudationa. and nature.    /Were the Habsburgs to lean on the other group, they would have to be prepared to lead peasantries against their landlords, and an industrial proletariat against the capitalists - more than any one can expect from rn ancient dynasty anil the clique of aristocrats, bishops, generals and high efficials by which they are surrounded.This is the third reason why the German-Magyar group is the more natural ally of the Habsburgs than its Slav rivals could ever be.&apos;. If the Habsburg Monarchy within its present frontiers must retain a German-Magyar character, in other words, if the Dual System must survive, if the German government in Vienna and the Magyar government in Budapest must remain dominant in the Monarchy, then it is indeed idle to talk of detaching Austria-Hungary from Germany or of doing justice to its submerged nationalities.     The most elementary and most moderate demand of the Csecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs, Ukrainians and Rumans for union at least within the borders of the Habshur^ dominions could not be satisfied;   they would have to remain partitioned between Austria dnd Hungary. Nor could any measure of territorial self-government be allowed to them in either of these two States, for that would run counter to the national and social systems on which the German rule is based in Austria, the Magyar rule in Hungary, and the Polish rule in Galicia.     These are facts not to be changed either by good-will or a clouded understanding in a member of the Hapsburg dynasty.     Such a change would amount to revolution both social and national, and therefore can be Effected by revolution alone. The dominion of the German, Magyar and Polish upper classes over the other nationalities is intimately bound up with their dominion over their own peasants and workmen, and is protected by the power
of the German Empire, the general guardian of Conservativeinterests in Eastern Europe.It is essential to distinguish primary from secondary interests;interests which determine action from those which merely producesympathies and dislikes.     It does not matter whom the EmperorCharles, Habsburg Archdukes, Austrian generals, II-gyar Counts orPolish politicians choose to curse in drawing-rooms or abroad,where the real test of action cannot be applied to them.     Thething which matters is, with whose interests the interests of thesepeople are compatible and with whom they can never establish a gmodus vivandi.
