: Majesty^ Government.) jLty-**^OQA/ J 0I think it is essential that my colleagues, should appreciate what is the real state of affairs in Ireland,    It is very difficult - almost impossible -to convey a true impression of Irish conditions at the moment, within the limits of a memorandum, hut I think if I put my views as briefly as I can on paper, they may form the basis for a discussion in the Cabinet which must - I submit - take place very shortly.I have not Consulted the Lord Lieutenant or the Chief Secretary in preparing this memorandum, but I have o$ course frequently discussed the subjects to which it refers with them and with many other re-presentative Irishmen.The general condition of the country outside of the six North-eastern counties is profoundly unsatisfactory.    As compared with the old bad days as they are called, there is this one marked improvement - namely that assassination is, I think, a thing of the past.    Of course there is always the risk of some fanatic or some relative of a prisoner, out of revenge, making attempts on the lives of the Lord Lieutenant or the Chief Secretary, but this after all is not materially different from the ordinary risks attending the life of a Sovereign or a leading Minister.    But in regard to the general condition of the country, there is undoubted cause for grave anxiety.    The farmers and traders are all extremely prosperous.    They desire nothing so much as that they shall be allowed to carry on their businesses without interruption, and during the last few weeks they have suffered under two real terrors.First
First, that there might ax any moment be a rising by Sinn Fein -which would cause much bloodshed and a wholesale interruption of business, with a consequent loss of the profits which are now being made.    Second, that the imposition of Conscription would produce something of the same land, and that even though the rising might not be so serious or so general that yet it would produce similar results in regard to trade and industry. But in Ireland, owing to the fact that outside of the sis countries there is practically no other industry than that of agriculture, there is always a considerable percentage of the male population who have no settled occupation. These are the men who previously to 1914 provided the great bulk of the emigrants leaving the shores of Ireland for the United States, Canada, Australia, etc.       Since the war this immi-gration has been stopped and therefore there is a much larger number of this unaccupied olass than is generally the case. Further all information goes to show that during the last ten vears the teachers in the schools have deliberately educated the boys and girls to believe that England is their hereditary enemy and that the Government of the King can be flouted and disregarded with impunity. To a very large extent these are the men who today belong to Sinn Fein and provide the. rebel armies which are daily marching and drilling all over the country. They are of course irresponsible,and unfortunately they have been allowed to do iust as they like, the soldiers and police having been obliged by the Civil Government to turn a blind eye to their performances, in order as it is said to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the country.  During my visit I saw many representative men of all classes, creeds, and politics coming from different parts of the country and I believe the conclusions I have arrived at would be endorsed byinearly
nearly all of them.    Conscription could have been applied with ease when it was first introduced in England.    It was actually expected after the Rebellion;   it could have been applied three or &quot;car months ago, if it had been possible to pass tho riecea-eary Act of Parliament and secure its adoption without delay -low. however, the situation is entirely changed.    The hierarchy have taken the field against the Government: with sery few exceptions the Priests are instructing their flocks tint resistance to Coi script ion will be blessed by God whereas the acceptance of Service under Conscription will end in sternal damnation.     With a population as superstitious and subservient to the Priests as are the mass of the Irish people this state of things means that it is impossible for the moment to attempt Conscription without most certainly meeting with riolent resistance.  . Further the Priests are   teaching their young men that if they are carried avray from Ireland to ingland - as it is said will be the case - they are to offer every opposition in their power afterwards and to render no tilling service.     On the whole I believe that if Conscription ere successfully enforced and the conscripts deported practi-cally as prisoners, they would become merely conscientious objectors.    It is very difficult to- form an accurate opinion 3f what would be the precise results of an&apos;attemot to enforce onsoription, as opinions vary very materially.    I think it is fair to say that the great majority hold the view that I lave expressed.     It is right to say that the lord Lieutenant looking at the question entirely from a -soldier&apos;s point of iew. believes that it could be enforced; that the bloodshed :&apos;culd not be very serious, and .that
that the conscripts would become good soldiers.    But having discussed the question with him frequently, I am satisfied that he under-rates the effect of the action of the Priests. But the Lord Lieutenant -wishes it to be clearly understood that while he holds this opinion as to the imposition and results of Conscription he considers that the application of the law is a matter of high policy to he considered from many different points of view and decided by the Cabinet, and not by the Irish Government.Now as regards Home Rule.    Some months ago a mode rat scheme of Home Rule would not have been accepted by the Nationalists, and, whatever the safeguards, would have been rejected by Ulster, but I believe that it would have been possible to secure its passage through Parliament without any very violent opposition, as undoubtedly there was a strong feeling in favour of a settlement.    Recent events have, however entirely changed the situation.    To-day the Nationalists, under Mr, Dillon&apos; are fighting Sinn Feiners.    They have not yet had the courage absolutely to disown Sinn Fein, but it is almost inevitable as a result of the East Cayan Election, and of the arrests, that this must be the end of the relations between the. two sections of the Irish Nationalist Party.    It is impossible for the Nationalists, even the most moderate amongst them to-day to contemplate anything but the most extreme measure of Home Rule if they are to continue their fight with Sinn Fein, and unless some sudden and wholly unexpected change were to come over the scene, any measure of Home Rule such as the Government could propose, would be rejected with scorn and contumely by the Nationalist Party, while it would be opposed with vehemence by Ulster and the great majority of theUnionists
Unionists in the South&apos; .   Recent events have strengthened the opposition of Ulster and the stalwarts of the South, vhile the 11 ere moderate men &quot;ho a short ti tie ago would have welcomed a settlement are convinced now that owing to the condition of the country it vTou3d be a criminal act to introduce Home Rule measure, and surely this iust be apparent to everybody? It is difficult, almost impossible, for the Nationalists to hold a seat against Sinn rein.    The Unionists are reluctant to vote for a Nationalist for  very natural reasons, and the extreme policy of the Sinn Feiners appeals more to the Irish nature than does the very difficult; attitude ^rhich the Nationlists are suddenly called upon to take up.    The  Govcn-ment have arrested and put in prison all the leaders of the Sinn Fein party, and the question is therefore asked by men from all parts of Ireland v*ho are not Nationalists, and even by some of the more moderate Nationalists, how can you pro-pose a great measure of devolution or self-government -call it what you like - at the very moment ^rhen o^ring to the condition of the country you are putting the leaders of Sinn Fein - no,,r the most popular organisation of the three Southern Provinces - into prison, and are every day taking drastic measure?; to stop illegal meetings, drilling, marching, highway robbery, assaults upon the person, and attacks upon houses and private property, and I submit that there is no answer to this c^uestion, which those v.fho advocate the immediate intro -duction of Borne Rule can by no possibility make with any hope of its acceptance by those who ask the Question.-hat then is to be the policy?  There is no doubt that we   are today paying the price-, and a very heavy one, for the grossmis-government-
mi3-government of Ireland during the last ten years.   The release of the prisoners in 1*16 was a terrible mistake. It $aye encouragement to Vie or.irflina.ls, it was Mediately seized upon by Ve leaders of fjinn Fein as evidence cf fear on the part of the Government, and from the day of their release down to the time of their arrest they have been plotting and intrlgiung against the King, the Government and tiie war, with the same vigour and determination as had characterised their proceedings before the Rebellion,   The Irish Government have got a very heavy burden to cany, lo put an end to marching and drilling will be extraordinarily difficult.   The Sinn Fein organisation is an extremely complete one,   In almost every village&apos; there is. a Sinn Fein Hall in mi oh meetings are held of a secret character, and the utmost intimidation is exercised in order to compel the unfortunate peasantry to j ore the organization.   Men meet in small parties for drill;   the leaders send out groups along different roads in order to mislead the police, and whilst small parties are found in different places, the mass manage to get together at some ether spot and hold their meeting. -The Irish Government have agreed upon a strong policy uhioh in.all probability will be successful.   The Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary have concerted measures which mil enable the military and the police to act in concert, and in my judgment the only course possible to.the Government is, if challenged, to say quite frankly.that since their policy .of Home 3ule plus Conscription was announced, the whole condition of things has&quot;changed, and that for the present it must be the duty of the Irish Government to establish the law in Ireland
and endeavour by voluntary methods to get as many recruits asmay be possible, the while clearly maintaining that theoriginal policy still holds good, and will if necessary be putinto force.   The difficulty which confronts one is that themore unwilling Ireland is to accept Conscription, the more thedifficulty of restoring order makes itself felt, the moreobvious it is that the proposed measure of Home Hule would bemet with disaster.   The opposition to it would not be violent,or of the old character, but it would be ridiculed by all andsundry in Ireland, whatever their policy or creeds.   I believe &apos;that in four or six months the Irish Government will haveproduced a very different state of affairs in the country.There is a wide-spread feeling in favour of peace and settlement,there is no doubt that the recent arrests have produced ageneral feeling of relief throughout the country and if theyare followed as they mil be by such measures as will restoreirothe liberty of the subject and make impossible foroutrages which are now of almost daily occurrence to recur,then there may be an entirely new atmosphere in Ireland, thereH ierarchy and the Priests will have had time toAconsider their position, and it may be possible to impose Conscription and to pass Home Bale, and if we could agree to prepare a Federal scheme applicable to the United Kingdom, Impersonally, believe from all I have heard, that in another six months this could be passed without any very serious trouble, and would be accepted, provided the country had in the meantime been restored to a condition of order,HIAL OFFICE.29.7.18.
