SECRET.(ThlBDoclerii is xno Property ofi) ^MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, May 22, 1918PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.(1) An Order, dated 10th. May, 1918, amending the Damaged Grain, Seeds and Pulse (Prices) Order, .1917, excludes maize from the operation of the Order except such as lias been damaged by water, and provides that on and after May 20 the price of any of the articles Avhich have been damaged by water and subsequently recondi-tioned or rendered more merchantable by kiln-drying or other process shall after such treatment not exceed 65s. per 4-80 lbs. in the case of imported food wheat, and in the case of any other article to which the Order refers, the price set out in the schedule.(2) An Order, dated. 13th May, 1918, amending the Horse and Poultry Mixtures Order, provides that on and after the 20th May, in calculating the actual cost to the maker of any ingredient to which the Damaged Grain, Seeds and Pulse (Prices) Order applies, the price, in the case of an article damaged by water and subsequently reconditioned or rendered more merchantable by kiln-drying or other treatment shall not exceed the maximum price set out in the Damaged Grain Seeds and Pulse (Prices) Order as amended.(3) The Sugar (Restriction) Order, 1918, dated .13th May, 1918, restricts the use of sugar during the year beginning June 1, 1918, by manufacturers other than the makers of. jam, condensed milk, and beer to certain fixed percentages of the sugar used by them in the corresponding periods of 1915. The [total quantity of sugar which may be used during the whole year ending May 31, 1919, is 25 per cent, of the quantity used in 1915. The Order also provides that all persons to whom its pro-visions apply shall keep a register showing in respect of each quarter the quantity of sugar in stock, and the quantity delivered or used.(4) An Order dated 14th May, 1918, amending the Fish (Prices) Order (No. 2), 1918, fixes the maximum prices chargeable by the producer, and the wholesale and retail dealer, on and after May 27, till further notice. A small reduction in prices is brought about for the summer months, and the principal Order is made to apply to Ireland.(5) The Rice (Retail Prices) Amendment Order, dated 16th May, 1918, fixes as from June 1st the retail price of rice at 4-.d. per lb, . Ground rice, rice flour, flaked rice, and similar rice products are fixed at a maximum price of 4fcL per lb., unless they are proprietary brands packed in cartons, in which case the maximum may be bid.(6) By Order dated the 16th May, 1918, it was ordered that Clause 2 of the .. IJublic Meals Order, 1918, should thereafter cease to apply to any public eating place in Great Britain without prejudice to any proceedings in respect of any previous contravention thereof.(7) An Authorisation, dated the 17th May, 1918, prescribes conditions subject to compliance with which persons may acquire farmers&apos; butter for home preservation.(8) The Bread Order, 1918, dated the 18th May, 1918, effects the following (amongst other) amendments and additions to the Bread Order, 1917. Delivery is permitted to sea-going vessels of bread under 12 hours old. From July 1st, the general permission for the wholesale delivery of bread not 12 hours old for re-sale (under certain conditions) is withdrawn, and such delivery will only be permitted under licence. Bakers are not permitted to use any imported flour in any mixture unless all their manufacture of bread on the same day contains a like quantity of imported flour. Bakers are to keep records of deliveries, manufacture, and sales, according to the form shown in the schedule to the Order.A  (33)5683-4   Pk 1   130  5/18  e&amp;s A
Control or Supplies.Allied Requirements. In response to representations as to precautions against tainted bacon and hams arriving in the United Kingdom from North America, Sir Guy Granet cables as follows :-&quot;There will be difficulty in obtaining desired guarantee against taint during summer. As you are aware, routing and shipment of goods are in the hands of Sir Connop Guthrio, and packers have not the full control in transit which they have in normal times. We had meeting yesterday with represen-tatives of United States railroad packers and Ministry of Shipping regarding routing, icing of cars, and handling of goods at port of export and on lighters. The meeting was continued to-day with packers, and adjourned again until to-morrow morning. The extent of guarantee obtainable cannot be determined until our discussion with packers is completed, but we hope to cable you again the beginning of next week.&quot;For the week ending May 18th, Sir Guy Granet estimates the commitments of tonnage at 7,072, to the food value of 4,624,814 dollars.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. A draft Order has been prepared, and is now under consideration, whereby definite maximum retail prices are fixed for the principal cuts of bacon. Final meetings must still be held with representatives of the trade, and separate conferences of wholesalers and retailers have been summoned for the 24th May.Though the price of bacon must depend on its cost in North America, no reduc-tion in which appears to be likely, it is probable that the actual effect of the proposed Order will be to reduce the average price charged to the consumer.A meeting of the Bacon Advisory Committee was held on the 21st May to consider proposals for lard distribution. It is clear that the distribution of lard, as part of a general fat ration, will encounter considerable opposition from the trade, as it will involve important alterations of the regular channels of supply.Butter. A further purchase of 109 tons of butter at 44 cents per lb., f.a.s., New York, has been made in the United States of America.On 13th May 3,975 tons of butter were distributed to the trade; on May 18th the stocks in hand amounted to 12,966 tons, the quantity on passage was 19,331 tons, and 1,024 tons arrived during the previous week.The disposal of the now plentiful supplies of fresh butter continues to occupy a considerable amount of attention. At a meeting held at Grosvenor House on the 6th inst. it was decided that a serious attempt to conserve the surplus of Lincolnshire butter should be made. Steps are being taken to start a factory for the purpose at Lincoln.Cheese. The quantity of cheese on the way to this country from New Zealand has been reduced to 7,217 tons, owing to the loss of 3,315 tons on the 18th May; 1,149 tons of cheese has arrived from the United States of America and 828 tons are still on the way; the unshipped stock amounts to 5,977 tons ; advise of the shipment of 915 tons of new season Canadian cheese has been received.Cocoa. Arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Shipping for the importation of 15,000 tons of raw cocoa during the summer months.The returns under the Cocoa Powder Order for the month of April are now complete, and show that on the whole the manufacturers have been able to dispose of the 40 per cent. Grade B. powder. The uncertainty of the wholesalers&apos; position has tended to restrict the sales of Grade B. powder so far as the larger manufacturers are concerned, and this question is now being considered with other points connected with the wholesalers. Reports show that the consumption of cocoa powder is decreasing somewhat as is usual in the summer months, but is still very considerably above the average.Coffee. Arrangements have been made for the Board of Trade to exempt coffee-roasters from the provisions of the Lighting, Heating, and Power Order, as this Order was having a most serious effect on the roasting and distribution of coffee.The consumption of coffee, though still above the average, is now decreasing.as is normal in the summer months.It has become obvious that some action will have to be taken - to increase the stocks of coffee for home consumption before the autumn, either by means. of requisitioning or by allowing fresh imports. , .      .:r
Dried Fruits. The reports received from the trade at the last meeting of the Advisory Committee were to the effect that the scheme for distribution of dates had worked satisfactorily, and that there were very few complaints. Practically all available dates have now been distributed excepting a few which were retained to meet cases of hardship, and to make adjustments in the general scheme.The &quot; Adamantos Lemos &quot; has arrived at Bristol, and a general distribution of currants, raisins, sultanas, and the requisitioned California]! fruits will shortly be made. The scheme will follow the general lines of the date scheme, with some small adjustments, which are being made in consultation with the Advisory Committee.The new scheme for the importation of dried fruits has been well received by the trade, and a few shipments are reported.Fish Distribution. Owing to the largely increased demand for fish created by general meat rationing, and to the fixing of maximum prices of fish in all its stages, there lias been a tendency on the part of boat owners who are also merchants and retailers to retain the whole of their catches for their own businesses instead of placing a certain proportion on the market for distribution through the wholesale merchants, with the consequence that the general distribution of fish has been put out of the normal.By arrangement with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Fishery Board for Scotland, it is proposed to make it compulsory for landed fish to be dealt with by the same method and in the same proportions as it was dealt with in 1917, so far as new circumstances admit,. and to maintain this allocation through the country by&apos;means of the existing control of wholesale merchants established by the Fish (Registration of Dealers) Order, 1918.Meat. Owing to the congestion in cold stores and the great difficulty of finding accommodation for the numerous cargoes arriving from North America, measures have had to be taken to increase the consumption of meat; it is not desirable to take any step which would curtail the sale of bacon, such as permitting the sale of butcher&apos;s meat, on the third coupon, and, therefore, the value of the first two coupons has been increased to Sd. each, making the total ration of butcher&apos;s meat Is. 4d., the highest yet permitted. This should represent an increased consumption of about 4,000 tons per week, but it is possible that in the hot weather this figure will not be reached. These adjustments prove the elasticity of the system, and it is evident that its adaptability to the varying conditions of supply commends it to the public and creates a feeling of confidence.The quality of much of the meat imported from North America still gives ground for dissatisfaction, both to butchers and the public. The supply of home-produced stock is coming forward more freely than was anticipated for the time of the year, and steps are being taken to restrict the grading of the less mature animals as fit for slaughter.The Joint Orders Committee of the Boards of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food has met to consider the proposed scheme for the allocation of supplies of pigs as between the Pork and Bacon Trades, the amount of the per.head charge on all pigs sold for slaughter, and the control of the small owner&apos;s pig.The three Departments of Agriculture have agreed to the graduated scale of prices for cattle sold for slaughter from December 1918 to June 1919 inclusive, which had previously been discussed at a conference between the Agricultural Advisory Committee and the Consumers&apos; Council.Milk.--The question of fixing the prices of milk in the various Divisions continues to absorb much attention, and the Commissioners urge that the matter requires prompt settlement. The Agricultural Advisory Committee advocate a flat producers&apos; price throughout the country varying between summer and winter.Oil Seeds. Purchase of Premier Jus up to the full quantity sanctioned by the Treasury has been made in South America ; the Ministry of Shipping has granted freight space for 10,000 tons a month, but purchases up to this amount cannot proceed until Treasury sanction is obtained.The agreement of the Ministry of Munitions to the purchase of whale oil is awaited.In the Argentine the price of linseed is still rising ; the last purchase was made at the rate of about 321. 1 Is. Qd. per ton landed at Liverpool; it is expected that the United States of America will act in the matter of regulating the price.There are indications that castor seed is being held back from the market by natives in India ; the India Office is investigating this matter.
Potatoes. Maximum retail prices have been prescribed for early potatoes of the 1918 crop sold in Great Britain.Poultry. Direct shipments of American goods are now being received ; they are being used mainly for consumption in military hospitals. Surplus supplies will be distributed for civilian consumption.Tea. At a general meeting of the Tea Buyers&apos; Association attended by officers of the Tea Branch of the Ministry of Food, the recent extra allotment of supplies to the Co-operative Wholesale Societies was explained.Arrangements have been made with forwarding agents in Liverpool and Man-chester for the collection and forwarding of teas at greatly reduced rates, which will benefit the wholesale trade.Organised Distribution.Local administration. In the past week 12 applications for sanction to increase the membership of the Food Control Committees have been received, and authority has been granted to 18 Committees to increase their numbers.Strong representations have been made to the Commissioner for North Wales by the Food Committees that their staffs should be exempted from military service, owing to the great difficulty in replacing them, or of training them for the responsible work required of them.- A satisfactory agreement has been arrived at in Scotland between the Food Commissioners and the Director of National Service for Scotland, and a scheme evolved which should enable the representatives of both Ministries, it is thought, to deal adequately with all cases of exemptions.Supplementary rations. The Sub-Committee for Supplementary Rations met on IGth May, when a letter from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress was read, supporting the views of their representatives and stating that any action taken in the matter after the 13th July, must be taken on the responsibility of the Ministry of Food. It was decided by the Sub-Committee to consult representative Food Committees on the question of continuing the scheme after the 13th July.The question of making special provision for discharged and disabled soldiers is being considered by the Medical Section. The Commissioner for the East of Scotland reports that the demand for the Supplementary Ration is less than wras expected.National Kitchens.The considered scheme for the establishment of these kitchens has now been definitely formulated. The country has been parcelled out into districts coinciding with the areas of the Food Commissioners, and a divisional director will be responsible in each district for carrying out the national policy. The kitchen at Poplar has been treated as a model experiment, and its success shows what can be accomplished under effective management by modern equipment and adherence to business methods. It has been established three months, and the weekly returns show a satisfactory and progressive profit. After provision has been made for cost of management, for estimated rental value, interest on and redemption of capital, renewal of plant and contingent liabilities, a profit is shown at the rate of 50 per cent, per annum. It is clear that much waste has been avoided, a considerable saving effected in fuel and labour, and good nourishing food provided for all who cared to come. The number of patrons 1 has steadily increased. The number of portions served in the first few weeks was about 1,000 per day, and has now grown to over 2,300 per day. The patrons include mothers, children, school teachers, bank clerks, commercial clerks, and artisans.. An attractive feature of this kitchen is the restaurant, which is attached. The number of portions served in the restaurant during its first few weeks was 30 to 40 per day, and this has now grown to 300 per day, no less a sum than SI. per week being realised from charges for table money of one penny for dinner and a half-penny for tea. A National Kitchens Handbook has been prepared and is now being printed, which sets out for the use of the local authorities and those who will be responsible for the organisation and administration of the kitchens, the methods necessary to ensure success.   The following essential points are laid down : (1) The premises must be in a good position and not in a back street, nor in a basement which necessitates descending many steps ;
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Imports of food in the week ended May 18th, 1918, though not so large as in the preceding week, wrere satisfactory (Table A). The total, 267,500 tons, was slightly above the figure for the corresponding week of last year. Of wheat and flour 117,100 tons arrived, and of other cereals 68,400 tons, compared with 124,200 tons and 100,100 tons the previous week. The proportion of flour was lower, and converted into equivalent grain, the drop in wheat amounted to 13,600 tons. The fall in other cereals was mainly attributable to rice which declined from the exceptional figure of 50,500 tons to 800 tons.Receipts of oats at 18,400 tons were higher than in any week since the week ended October 6th, 1917.      jArrivals of meat were larger than for several weeks past. Against this must be set the lower importations of bacon and hams. Little cheese was received during the week.   Sugar rose from 18,700 tons to 29,900 tons.The following table, showing imports of all principal foods and of cereals and meat separately, affords a comparison between the first 20 weeks of 1918 and 1917. , Rice has been excluded as no comparative figures for last year are available.  The;   . a3(2) The interior must be bright and attractive;(3) The plant and equipment must be modern and efficient;(4) The cooks and the stall must be suitably dressed ;(5) The menu must be varied, and the food of the best quality, prepared by experienced cooks, who can produce the best results in the most appetising and attractive form, regard being hafl at all times to nutritive values.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions for the past week was 830, an increase on the previous week of 213; 776 cases resulted in convictions. The largest number of cases were sent in by the following divisions : Cambridge - - - 165, percentage of convictions 100 London 92,      ,,       ,,       ,, 94Home Counties   -     -     -    86,      ,,       ,,       ,, 94Leeds 53,      ,,       ,,       ,, 100The exceptional number of convictions in the Cambridge Division was due principally to 130 charges brought against one defendant. P. T. Lewis, grocer, was summoned on 53 charges under the Tea (Prices) Order, 64 under the Margarine (Prices) Order, and 13 under the Jam (Prices) Order. The Chairman stated that the penalties incurred, if taken separately, would have amounted to 13,000L The actual total of fines inflicted was 50L (including costs).Messrs. Selfridge &amp; Co. were fined 50L in each of two cases, one for manu-facturing rolls of bread, the other for manufacturing buns from flour not dealt with as required under the Cake and Pastry Order, 1917. Noticeably heavy fines were charged in a series of cases brought against T. Rosin, baker, in the London Division, for excess charges on bread. In one instance the fine was 10QI. (including costs), and subsequent tines were 50Z., 201., and 16L, while for selling sugar when unregis-tered he was fined 111.The largest number of cases was in connection with the Margarine (Retail Prices) Order, numbering 78 an increase of 55 on the previous week. Prosecutions in connection with the Jam (Prices) Order also showed a large increase 55 as against 8 in the previous week.
increased tendency to import wlieaten flour instead of grain reduces somewhat the deficiency in cereals shown below : 	--............j- Aggregate i (excluding IUcq).		1    i Cereals (excluding llice).

Total supplies of meat at the Central Markets, London, and at Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool, for the week ended May 11th, were 9 per cent, lower than in the previous week, and 3.1 per cent, lower than a year ago. Not since the week ended March 23rd has the total been so small. Both home and foreign meat were responsible for the decline. The fall in the latter was 10 per cent. ; the corresponding week of last year saw a slightly greater fall. Home supplies, which had increased steadily week by week since the end of March, declined 7 per cent. Although home supplies are normally lower in May than in April, in the corresponding week of last year there was a substantial increase (Table B).Supplies at the Central Markets for the week ended May 18th, showed practically no change on the week before ; a slight decrease in foreign supplies was nearly balanced by an almost equal increase iu home-fed meat.The number of cattle returned as stalled at the markets in the week ended May 18th was 40 per cent, less and the number of sheep 59 per cent, less than in the corresponding week of last year. A comparison between the weeks ended May 11th and May 4th, 1918, is given below. Owing to the small number of returns received from Scottish markets, too much importance must not be attached to the results shown for Scotland and Great Britain.Number of Cattle Stalled.

Returns from a large number of co-operative stores and multiple shops for the four weeks ended May 11th, 1918, lead to the index numbers shown in Table E. The increase in the sales of bacon and hams is significant, amounting as it does to no less than 95 per cent.; for the first time for a long period consumption was higher than in the corresponding weeks a twelvemonth before.

Only in the case of cheese was more than one week&apos;s supply in stock on the night of May 11th. &apos;Fish. For the week ended May 18th there was a marked increase in the supply of iish at Billingsgate Market. The total for the week was 2,742 tons, an improve-ment of 34 per cent, on the week before and of 30 per cent, on the corresponding week of last year.Milk. The milk index (Table D) which had fallen slightly in the week ended May 4th rose sharply in the week ended May 11th, 4^ points to 105. The quantity of milk carried- on each of the railways is now higher than at any time since September last.Stocks.Figures for farm-stocks on May 1st having been received from the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for England and Wales, the entries for total stocks of cereals have been revised. The estimates for wheat and barley were little affected, but that for oats was appreciably decreased. Later estimates are shown below with corresponding figures for last year. Stocks of maize have again risen and are now above the figures of a year ago. The improvement in the wheat position as compared with 1917 is even more noticeable than at the commencement of the month.Principal Cereals.	Article.	Estimated Stocks in the United Kingdom.

Part of this may be returned by other dealers. To add it to the total whould therefore involve certain duplication ; allowance cannot be made for such duplication as the amount that would be so entered twice is not known.Sales of butter have increased 17 per cent, and of lard 8 per cent. ; on the other hand sales of cheese have fallen by nearly 37 per cent. Eggs, which are shown for the first time, have risen 3 per cent, on last month, but are 4 per cent, lower than a year ago.The actual weights sold, included in the returns, are given in the following table : 
Stocks of meat and provisions have changed little since the commencement of the month. Exceptions are bacon and hams, lard, butter and cheese. Prom the 1st to the 11th May, bacon and hams rose from 30,100 tons to 46,100 tons; lard from 4,400 tons to 7,300 tons ; butter from 8,100 tons to 11,200 tons. Cheese during the same period fell from 10,300 tons to 8,000 tons, the lowest it has been since June last. In&apos; addition there is a considerable amount of lard which will ultimately find its place in the recorded stock.-   Wholesale Prices.The price of Irish bacon has risen sharply from 190s. b&apos;d. to 207s. Qd. per cwt. A year ago it was 151s. per cwt.
