From:   British Military Representative, Washington. Tot      War Office.Received at 9.10 p,m. 24,5,18B. 40,   May 24th.. Following for C.I.G.S.     Begins:Reference your cipher telegram ITo. 58624 of May 19th. Nothing here to show that Supreme War Council actually reached such a decision.     If that were so, and if General Foch would declare that such intervention in his opinion would have a direct effect on tho present situation either by weakening the Germans on the Western front or by preventing further reinforce^ mento being transferred from East to West and that to ensure the succoss of our future offensive in the western theatre such action is indispensable, our hand would be strengthened.   Owing to circumstances with which you are familiar, this declaration backed by decision of Supreme War Council would at the present time carry more weight here than any amount of non-military negotiations and would give us a fresh base to work from. Feeling in the Army at large as well as general public and press incline to intervention.     Despatch to Murmansk of a Brigade of American Marines has been unofficially discussed.   . Would you consider this?
General Bridges, Washington. From:-C.X.G.S., War Office.25th May, 1918.........i.Cypher (D.M.O.).Your B.40, dated May 24th.I have wired substance of your cable to General Du Oane for Foch and have asked latter to support proposal at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council, at which the question will be brought up.I have already suggested the despatch to Murmansk of an American Brigade, and in fact consented to the despatch of a small British force there only on the understanding that it would &quot;be backed up subsequently by American troops.   This pro-posal ha3 been agreed to in principle by the British Government, although it wa3 not considered advisable to approach the United States Government about it at the moment,
(it)Tp:-General Du Cane at General Fooh&apos;s Headquarters.From:-O.I.G.S.) War Office.25th May, 1918..........Cypher (D.:i.O.).With reference to Allied intervention in Siberia, General Bridges wires that our hand would be greatly strengthened, in dealing with President Wilson if General Foch would declare that, in his opinion, such intervention would have a direct effect on the present situation, either by weakening the Germans on the Western Front *r by prevent-ing, further reinforcements being transferred from Bast to West, and that to ensure the success of our future offensive in the Western theatre such action is indispensable.     I hope that this question will come before the Supreme War Council at its nest meeting.     In the meantime, please suggest the above views to General Foch and say that I hope he will see his way to supporting them.
