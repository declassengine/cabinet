of41MINISTRY OF SHIPPING.( b PROPOSAL TO,REPLACE A VESSEL LOST BY WAR RISK BY GIVING THE-   qwn^r- a c;TANDA&apos;hdl jliFr(a     ------------1.    The Owners of the S/S/ &quot;GEO&quot;, recently lost by War Risk while under requisition to the Ministry of Shipping, havO asked that in lieu of money compensation a standard ship may be given to them.2.    It may be assumed that if this vrere done the sub-stituted vessel would remain under requisition for oo long as is necessary and that any necessary adjustment in respect of difference of value would be made.3,    This is the first formal application of the kind, but others no doubt will follow, and a decision on the question is desired by the Shipping Controller.    On the general question the following observations are submitted.4.    Financially there can be little doubt that the transaction ?/ould be of substantial advantage to the Government. The Blue Book gives the shipowner under tho present conditions a low rate of hire and a full cover against loss.    The value of British tonnage has in tho aggregate more than trebled since 1914, and although this increase is very much less than the rise which has taken place in any other country, nevertheless the increase in values has proceeded faster than the increase in building costs.     It follows that the compensation payable to the owners of lost vessels under the Blue Book is somewhat greater than would be necessary (allowing for tho difference between a new and an old boat) if when the lost vessels are replaced building costs remain at their present level, and very much greater than would be necessary if as is generally anticipated a sharp fall takes place in the value of tonnage shortly after the war.     For the time being no private contracts can be carried out, and Government is building to replace private
o1^ *5.     If these assumptions are correct it la clearly to the advantage of the Government to replace in kind now.     The alternative is to pay cash to the owner at current values and to take the risk of a fall in the value of the Government owned ship.     If, as is not unlikely, the value of an 8,000 ton standard ship falls shortly after the war to (say)  14 a ton, the alter-native transactions would work out as follows:- ignoring minor adjustments:-Per ton d.?r.Compensation paid for,lost vessel (market value,at date of loss)  24Amount realised for standard ship or otherreplace vessel, aftor the war  14Difference        108,000 tons at  10   *  80,*000.This assumed difference of  10 a ton can be analysed into the following elements:-(a) the excess of the current market value of a ready ship over the cost at which standard ships can be built for Government in this country.(b) the value of possession to a private owner during the remaining period of requisition.(c) the net value of the use of the vessel during that period, under Blue Book terms.(d) the value of the expectation of a period of profitable trading in the interval between the end of requisition and the time when the owner could build a replace vessel.6.     The value of good clas3 tramp tonnage has beenforced up to a high level mainly by the purchasing activities ofthe Liner Companies, who must be in a position to maintain theirregular trade immediately after the war.     One effect oftransferring Government owned vessels to private ownership shouldbe to reduce this inflation, which is a serious national dis-advantage and serves only to yield very large profits to thoseowners who go out of business.
7.    Apart from finance it is in the opinion of the Shipping Controller very desirable in the national interest that tramp owners who desire to remain in business should be enabled to do so.    This can only be done by giving them ships; if they are given money (which for the time being will usually be invested in Government securities) there is no guarantee that it will ever come back into shippings - The loss to the British Mercantile Marine of the experience and enterprise of any considerable number of tramp owners would be a serious loss to the nation.8.      The Shipping Controller views with alarm the presenttendency for tramp owners to go out of business, tho root causeof which is, in his opinion, not the relatively unremunorativenature of the business at the present time, but the loss of shipsand the impossibility to the owners of replacing them.      Theresult of the present policy is twofold:-(i)   So far as owners do not replace their ships by purchase from other owners they are being gradually converted, as Lord Inchcape has put it, from Shipowners into financial institutions, investing mainly in Government, securities;(ii)   So far as they do so replace, by bidding against each other for the diminishing, number of vessels which remain in private ownership, they are putting up the value of ships against the Government and the compensation payable for lost vessels is pro tanto increased.In the Shipping Controller^ opinion the position socreated is inherently unsound and may even involve elements of .danger to the financial stability of the country.9.      If the proposal is approved in principle, it is suggested that details, including the question whether replacement in kind should be at the owners&apos; or at Government option, should be settled by the Shipping Controller.   It may be added that under the United States Government requisitioning Scheme, a power is taken to replace in kind, the option to be exorcised by the Government within three months after the loss and delivery to be made within a year after the loss.
22nd May, 1918.Under the scheme of general requisition recently adopted by the French Government that Government undertakes an obliga-tion to replace, where replacement is possible, no other form of compensation being provided.10.   The only argument against the policy recommended in this memorandum appears to be that, based on the possible reaction on shipyard workers,and on labour generally if it could be represented that ships built ostensibly as Government ships were in reality to be handed over to private owners.     In view of the fact that the standard ships so disposed of would be only a pro-portion, and probably a small proportion, of the total number, it is not thought that any serious difficulty need be apprehended on this score, but the matter appears to be essentially one for the Government as a whole to determine on grounds of general policy.This memorandum is submitted, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and with his concurrence.
