Involving a Stoppage of Work. The only strikes of any gravity are those in the South Wales coal-field, and at Cammeil, Laird&apos;s, Birkenhead.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. There is trouble in the building trade at Birmingham and Liverpool with regard to district rates. Otherwise no serious dispute is in progress. -I.-General Bemarks.The Trouble in the South Wales Coalfield.The strike which commenced in four pits of the Tredegar Company, and which was prematurely reported as settled on the 17th May, now shows signs of spreading with some rapidity, the latest news being to the effect that four pits of the EbTbw Vale Company have come out in sympathy. Altogether nearly 30,000 men appear to be on strike in South Wales. The origin of the strike was, as is frequently the case, a small incident. It appears that in the Markham Colliery a workman was killed, and twenty men employed in that portion of the mine left their work, on the ground that the part was dangerous. For this they were stopped a &quot;quarters&quot; pay, The men alleged a grievance on the ground that the &quot; quarter &quot; is not customary in South Wales. The matter was raised with the Managing Director, Mr. Tallis, by a deputation from what is known as the &quot; Tredegar Combine Committee of Miners,&quot; or the &quot; Combine Lodge.&quot; The Managing Director refused to receive the. deputation, and, in consequence, 8,000 men came out from the four pits whose workmen are governed by the Joint Committee.A similar committee exists in the Ehymney Valley, and an incident of the same kind occurred there, Mr. Butherford, managing director of the Ehymney Iron Company, having refused to meet the Workmen&apos;s Joint Committee with reference to a dispute. This latter affair was referred to the Conciliation Board, which refused to direct Mr. Rutherford to meet the Committee. The men did not go on strike, but referred the matter to the Coal Controller, who is reported to have received a deputation of the Committee, and their recognition by the management has been granted. In the [1100-31] B
Tredegar case the management has agreed to recognise the Joint Committee on con-dition that the men should return to work, and when the return to work is accomplished a deputation will be received.This solution of the difficulty has been accepted by the executive of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, who met on Saturday and passed a resolution advising the men to return to work at once. Meanwhile, however, an agitation has been initiated for a coalfield conference on the whole incident, and strikes in svmpathy with the Tredegar men have occurred in the pits belonging to other companies;, with the result that the matter has become exceedingly complicated. On Sunday last the recommenda-tions of the Executive Council were considered at mass meetings held by the miners at Tredegar and Blackwood, where they were unanimously rejected, and it was resolved that the strike should continue until a coalfield conference was called.From this short description of the proceedings up to date it is clear that the dispute, which originated in a legitimate demand of the men for recognition of their Joint Committee by the management of the Tredegar Company, has now shifted its basis altogether, and has, in fact, developed into a dispute between the Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation and the strikers&apos; organisation, as to &quot;whether the men should return to work before or after reception of their deputation by the management.The position is illustrative of the weakening of the authority of constitutional trade union government, which is not confined to the South Wales coalfield. In that field trouble has been created in the past by a body which calls itself the Unofficial Reform Committee, and which occupies in the South Wales coal-mining industry much the same position as that of the National Amalgamated Committee of Shop Stewards in the engineering and metal industries. An organisation of the same kind has been formed in the Lanarkshire coalfield, and to its activities has been due the series of one-day strikes in protest against the Man-Power arrangements of the Government.It is clear that this complication, renders the position very much more difficult than if the dispute were a straight fight between the management and the men on the question of recognition of the men&apos;s committee. It would evidently be most impolitic to make any concessions to unauthorised strikers, which would strengthen the hands of organisations which are in an attitude of hostility to recognised and constitutional trade union authorities. However much reduction of output may be regretted, it appears to be the obvious duty of the Government to support the Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation in their struggle against non-official organisations, which have arrogated to themselves powers which by right belong to the Federation.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.&quot; Justice,&quot; referring to a difference of opinion between the Ministry of Pensions and the Treasury about pensions for military service, compares the British scale with that for the colonies, especially New Zealand. Liberality is essential, and pressure should be exerted to secure an improvement.The &quot;Herald&quot; reports a complaint by a deputation of discharged soldiers and sailors against four Labour members of the Poplar Tribunal, who are said to be unpatriotic and never to vote for a man being taken in the army.Political Affairs.In foreign politics most attention is given to the debate raised by Mr. Runciman on the adjournment for the Whitsuntide holidays. Mr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; holds that the admissions made by Mr. Balfour, Mr. Asquith, and Lord Robert Cecil bind both the present Government and the Liberal Opposition to more moderate war aims and a policy of peace negotiations. He asks why the demand for extension of the French boundaries to the Rhine was allowed to destroy the possibility of peace, if it is not supported by Britain. The main obstacle at present is the ambition of France and Italy. As Great Britain is the predominant partner among the Allies, she must exercise the greatest authority in determining war aims.In the &quot; Herald &quot; Mr. Brailsford, analysing President Wilson&apos;s speech on the same subject, points out that it introduces fresh reasons for rejecting the offer.   These are to
be found in the claim of the Central Powers for a free hand to carry out conquest and exploitation in the East. The fact is, however, that the Allied Powers may all have divergent reason;; for refusing&apos; peace, so long as they all agree to continue war. Secret treaties are still the basis of our diplomacy.Labour views on Russia are still widely divergent. In &quot;Justice &quot; appears a further instalment of the ar! icles on that country. Government by the Czar, not the revolution; is responsible for the Russian collapse. Committees formed in 1915 to organise industry were hindered and broken up just as results began to appear, and the workers&apos; represen-tatives v. ere exiled. The Bolsheviks are not a majority, and have repressed the Constituent Assembly. Now the women of Russia are going to play a large part hi their country *s redemption. Siberia will be the means of the greatest resistance to further encroachment by Germany. If; is rich in national resources, and is the horns of the best of the Russian peoples and the children of exiled intellectuals. On the other hand, Mr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; thinks that Bolsheviks have succeeded in an incredibly short, time in giving the most stable Government which! Russia has possessed during the war. The Allies should help them to escape becoming political and economic vassals of Germany. If Britain recognised the Bolsheviks an imorovement would begin at once.A similar discordance sounds in articles on the Socialist minority in Germany. In the &quot;Call&quot; Kautskv and his friends are blamed, not for failing&apos; to make a revolution, but for omitting to prepare the way for one. They do not want one, and are essentially anti-revolutionary, so they have damped sympathy with the Bolsheviks and hindered every revolutionary endeavour by German workers to assist Socialist Russia. Contra-dieting this view, &quot; Justice &quot; reprints a report of the proceedings in the Reichstag on the 4th August, 1914, and condemns the German Social Democratic party for regarding the war as one waged for national independence and self-defence.An interesting note on the treatment of the American Labour Commission in Paris appears in &quot;Justice.&quot; It asserts that an attempt was made to impress the members with the agreement of the French to attend an international congress at which Germans should be present. Just before their departure the members were enlightened by the real majority of French Socialists, who explained that they had been kept apart, and that they agreed with the Americans in refusing to meet Germans. The full text of the French address is printed and approved by the &quot; British Citizen and Empire Worker.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; lays stress on the fact that the American Federation of Labour has never taken part in the International Labour and Socialist Congress, and does not know the atmosphere. Nor has it taken any. part in politics at home. It has no notion of the kind of peace it desires, and wishes only to support the President, with the qualification that it demands a meeting of international Labour representatives concurrently with that of diplomatists, when peace terms are discussed.Home Affairs.Ireland receives a good deal of attention, especially in regard to the arrests and deportations. A demand for the publication of evidence is made by the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; &quot;Justice,&quot; and the &quot; Herald.&apos;&quot; The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; describes Lord Frenctfs proclamation as a candid admission of the folly of Government in attempting to enforce conscription. The &quot;Call&quot; is doubtful whether Government intends either to frame charges or to institute prosecutions. An indefinite detention is, however, mad folly, hardly conceivable. British Labour can save Ireland if it speaks at once. In the opinion of &quot;Justice&quot; the whole trouble is due to changes in policy, caused by weak men rushing to extremes. The position is complicated by two main forces, one strong numerically and one economically, while the division on religious opinion is the most difficult of all. Mr. A. Lynch, M.P., in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; ascribes much of the blame to want of ballast in the Sinn Feiners and the action of the priests. The latter, especially the younger men, are Sinn Feiners, and are powerful through both religious influence and their own good character and devotion. His remedy is to withdraw consdiption and announce a large measure of Home Rule, so magnificent as to attract Ulster, and especially reassuring on the religious side. Education must be remoulded to give something more real, scientific, and strengthening than Ireland has yet enjoyed. Mr. Lansbury in the &quot;Herald&quot; is briefer and more direct. If Lord French is sincere and fair, he must intern Sir Edward Carson. The British garrison should be removed and Ireland left to settle its own affairs.An article in the &quot;Call&quot; deprecates attempts to restore the popularity of Lord Grey and Mr. Asquith. These two were parties to the secret treaties, which would hang round their necks if they returned to power.
Labour.The Trade journals show a considerable amount of feeling still existing against the A.S.E. and hesitation at thy thought of joining with it.The Admiralty scheme for shipyard committees is strongly criticised in the &quot; Herald,&quot; which points out that it diverges from the model suggested by the Whitley Committee in not recognising Trade Unions. In the &quot;Shipbuilding and Shipping Record &quot; also a preference is expressed for the system of yard, district, and national committees set up by the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and Shipyard Trades Unions. Replying to objections by some owners, it points out that the system it prefers is still far short of advanced Trade Unions&apos; ideal of control, and it possesses two notable advantages, viz., industrial co-operation from yard and shop up to executive circles, and the handling of trouble at its source. To the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; the scheme appears to include every possible disadvantage. It fosters sectionalism, shuts out the most active workers by requiring five years&apos; service to qualify men as represen-tatives, directs workers first to take their grievances to the minor officials against whom their complaints are strongest, and puts all power in the hands of officials.The &quot; Textile Mercury &quot; criticises the fixing of longer hours in woollen and worsted mills. A mistake was made for a year after production was limited in retaining an unnecessarily large number of workers and reducing the hours. Now there is a danger of going to the other extreme. It is wrong to lay down that men should not be kept on, so as to provide work for women and children. Care of the latter is an urgent national interest. The same paper approves of the new scheme for reducing output in the cotton textile factories, The &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; however, holds that the reduction is excessive, and that the sums to he raised from the trade are greater than required for the relief of unemployment, and will diminish the power of the employers to pay adequate wages.Of disputes between unions, the complaint in the annual report of the National Union of Printing and Paper workers against the National Union of Bookbinders may be mentioned. It relates to the action of the latter in organising women who&apos; could enter other unions.A correspondent in the &quot; Railway Gazette&quot; suggests the appointment of labour directors on the boards of railway companies, but an editorial article says this is premature till railway directors are admitted to the controlling bodies of trade unions.The &quot; Herald&quot; refers with some approval to a report of utterances by the bishops in convocation on labour questions.   It asserts, however, that bishops must do a&quot; good deal more plain thinking before their opinions will have much, effect.   They must take their courage in their hands, and be prepared to stand before workers against capitalism and landlordism.Food.In the absence of new complaints the labour papers are chiefly busy with criticism of past mistakes. The &quot; Call &quot; holds that profiteers still possess an almost ree hand in the supply of meat. Mr. Carmichael in the &quot; Herald &quot; says he is still studying that question. For the present he is- content to praise the impartiality of the Ministry in allowing workers to get fresh meat while the bourgeois has to be content with frozen.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this area still remains quiet and satisfactory, and few reports of any importance have been received.At Whiteheads&apos; some discontent is expressed owing to the information that the Ministry of Munitions have decided to discontinue the one hour bonus in the morning, and to alter the time of starting to 6.30. To this alteration the men are showing great opposition, and it is believed that all aircraft woodworkers will demand 2d. an hour increase.Trouble is also threatened at the Aircraft Manufacturing Company and Grahame White&apos;s, where it is proposed to discharge the painters and employ women instead.Similar trouble with regard to the introduction of discharged soldiers is referred to by the Ministry of Munitions, who mention a disposition among aircraft workers in
this district to create trouble on the smallest pretext, in order to obstruct their employment.South-Western.On the whole, reports from this district are favourable.Unrest is, however, displayed in Gloucestershire, where the agricultural labourers are threatening to strike unless their demand for 45s. per week is conceded.At Bristol, again, some suspicion is evident that the A.S.E. are not being combed out as stringently as other tradesThe question of non-unionists is also much discussed at Bristol, where a movement throughout the transport workers in general is in progress to compel non-unionists to join a union. It is reported that pressure upon this point may be brought to bear upon the Government.West Midlands.The situation in this area seems to be somewhat disturbed, though the danger of the dispute at the Austin Works spreading further throughout the Midlands has subsided on the return to work at that factory. There seems, however, to be considerable danger of a strike in the Building Trade at Birmingham, the details of which are dealt with in Part IV of this report.In the former dispute the prominent shop steward, Tom Dingley, was to some extent responsible for the agitation, though it is also reported that Sir Herbert Austin is injudicious in his dealings with his men, and is very unpopular.Yorkshire and East Midlaiids.In this area the situation is at present very satisfactory, and no evidence of acute labour unrest has appeared. This is probably due in part to the expectation of a fresh German offensive.Among the engineers and steelworkers there has, however, been much discussion of a demand for increased wages, and the Leeds Engineering Committee has decided to demand a five-day week of nine hours daily and an immediate advance of 2,s\ weekly, if the affiliated trades agree.The additional wage is claimed on the ground that, with a shorter week, the efficiency of the workers would be greater, and-the output consequently increased.Shop stewards at Sheffield held a meeting about the Man Power Bill and decided not to oppose it. In mining areas,, however, it is still the subject of protest. At some places the taking of skilled men before those who have entered the pits since 1914 is contested, while in others the method of ballot is said to be wrong. Upon this latter question the miners of the Castleford area threatened to abstain from work after Whitsuntide, but were finally persuaded to return.In Sheffield the arrest of the Sinn Feiners has evoked strong support of the Government action.North-Western.Conditions in this district are still disturbed, though no acute agitation has yet arisen. This disturbance centres mainly in various applications for increased wages. Thus dock labourers are still continuing to press for a rise in wages, and have now refused to take less than 12s. a week, while the Mersey coasters, men and labourers, are putting forward a similar, demand. Unrest among the boilermakers and electricians at Liverpool has also arisen owing to the. non-payment of the recent award of 2s. 6d. to the engineering trades.  , -       hThere is somewhat serious trouble at Messrs. Cammell, Laird&apos;s, Birkenhead, owing to a demarcation dispute between boilermakers and sheet-metal workers.In Manchester conditions are reported to be on the whole quiet, and it is thought that the award of 25 per cent, in the cotton trade agreed upon by representatives of the employers and operatives will give every satisfaction. The employment of discharged soldiers seems, however, to be causing friction throughoutthis part of the district, as these men are regarded as dilutees, and strikes have been threatened.Northern.With the exception of a somewhat unimportant strike of painters, conditions in this area are very quiet.[1100-31] C
A &quot;meeting of the Engineering Trades at Newcastle was of a very quiet and orderly nature. A report was presented of the conference at York on the 16th May proposing the establishment of machinery to expedite the settlement of disputes. The meeting decided to press at once for a Bill to restore Trade Union rights and practices after the war. It also favoured aiming at a forty-four-hour week and an advance in wages equivalent to 100 per cent, above pre-war rates.South Wales.Apart from the serious strike at the Tredegar Collieries, which is dealt with in Parts I and IV, and a strike in theEbbw Vale Works, the situation in this area is quiet and no reports of unrest have been received.Scotland.An improvement is again manifest in this area, and no serious unrest is apparent. The threatened strike of bakers in various parts of the district has been averted for the present, but further claims for higher rates are expected.The conviction of John McLean has resulted in the formation of a committee, the &quot; Clyde District Propaganda Defence Committee,&quot; which has as its object the protection of working class propaganda and the defence of such victims as McLean. This com-mittee has arranged for a demonstration at Glasgow on the 2nd June, in which all prominent Glasgow agitators will take part.Hitherto the arrest of the Sinn Feiners has not caused much comment and, though meetings are being held, no definite action has as yet been suggested.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation is fairly satisfactory, and no strike of serious importance is mentioned except that in the South Wales coalfield.The Shipyard Labour Department reports only one new stoppage of work, while settlements in 13 old cases have been effected.There is a small and unimportant stoppage at Messrs. R. Hill and Co., Newcastle, where some men and boys ceased work, owing to the heat, on the 23rd, and refused to start work on the next morning. The local representative of the men is now investigating the question.A serious stoppage has occurred at Messrs. Cammell, LaircVs, Birkenhead, owing to a demarcation dispute. Boilermakers and sheet-metal workers both claim the right to make cases for evaporating engines, and, finding the latter at work on these cases, the boilermakers ceased work on the 26th May. On the 29th May 3,000 men were reported to be on strike. A meeting was held on that day, and it was resolved to return-to work, and submit the matter to arbitration.The Ministry of Munitions reports 7,487 workpeople involved in strikes for the week ending May 22nd.The strike at the Austin Motor Works ended on 24th May, when the men resumed work pending negotiations.The- question of dilution caused a short strike at the General Aircraft Company, Gricklewood. where 150 men and 100 women struck against the employment of women in what they alleged to be skilled work. A delegate of the Carpenters and Joiners&apos; Society secured a decision to return to work.A strike of painters occurred at Leeds, which involved 600 men, owing to the demand for the 12  per cent, bonus on earnings. The earnings of these men have previously been high, but the employers were forced to concede their demands so as not to lose heavily on contracts already made.   Work has now been resumed.The W7ar Office Contracts Department has no new strikes to report this week. The Coal Controller notes three new stoppages of work involving in all 22,870 men.The men at Tredegar did not resume work as was reported last week, and the strike has spread to other collieries. The situation is being discussed with the Coal Controller. A description of this strike is given in Parti. Four other minor stoppages in South Wales still continue.Work lias been resumed in all the Yorkshire Colleries which had ceased in connection with the recruiting grievances. One short stoppage has taken place in Scotland, and another old one, involving only 24 men, still continues.
(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.i The Shipyard Labour Department reports 40 new controversial cases and 94 old ones unsettled.   Settlements have been effected in 34 cases.The dispute at the Manchester Dry Docks Company, which was mentioned last week, seems to have progressed no further.In the London area some trouble lias been experienced at Messrs. Lester &amp; Perkins with regard to irregular time-keeping by boilermakers. On Saturday, 11th, practically no work was done, but the men threatened to refuse to resume work on Monday unless the quarters pay was received on Saturday. The firm have requested the intervention of the Shipyard Labour Department, which is now dealing with tho matter.The Ministry of Munitions reports that considerable unrest has arisen in the Dundee jute factories upon the question of dilution, and the A.S.E. are threatening to call out all their members unless a satisfactory settlement is reached. The jute mills are apparently not controlled, but they are all engaged upon urgent Government work.There is again unrest at the National Ordnance factory, Hunslet, on account of the dismissal of a foreman. The reason given is that, being a skilled toolmaker, he could be more usefully employed in his own trade. There is considerable fear of a strike among the skilled men.In the building trade at Birmingham two claims are reported. The first is a demand for payment of bonus from the 1st January instead of from the 11th April. At a mass meeting on the 19th May it was decided to give notice to strike unless the claim was conceded; Later reports show that a claim is now made for the new Liverpool rate of Is. M. per hour for skilled work and Is. id. for unskilled.In this trade at Liverpool also discontent still prevails. At a meeting on the 26th it was decided to give the Government 21 days&apos; notice unless the flat rate of Is. 6c?. is recognised by them; this rate is being paid by firms on private work, but not on Government work, owing to the refusal of the Government to recognise the rate.The War Office Contracts Department reports three new controversial cases.A dispute arose at A. Benedict and Co.,- Leeds, owing to the employment of Austrians by the firm at low rates, as the result of a threat of reinternment. The Garment Workers&apos; Union complained of this to the Home Office, and, as a result, some of these aliens have been removed to other firms. Enquiries are being made into the wages complaint.A dispute has arisen between the Textile Workers and the Woollen Employers&apos; Federation over the recent award of the Committee on Production. The Union contend for a 12^ Per advance on the bonus percentage to both time and piece workers, while the Committee left it to the masters to make adjustments in the rates paid to piece workers. It has been arranged that both sides shall be heard again by the Committee on Production.The Coal Controller reports only one new controversial case.This is a dispute, similar to that at the Tredegar Collieries, which arose at the Rhymney Iron Company&apos;s pits in connection with the recognition of a combine committee. A settlement was, however, effected which was accepted as satisfactory by the miners&apos; leaders.The Committee on Production has heard 35 arbitration cases in London, during the week.- The most important of these were an application by the boilermakers for a 50 per cent, increase on piece work rates to riveters, platers, and angle smiths, another by the Dock, Wharf, Riverside, and General Workers&apos; Union for increased wages and alterations in general conditions of labour, and an application by aircraft workers for the extension of the Committee on Production^ Award to skilled workers of the 18th March, so as to include semi-skilled and unskilled men.The Chief Industrial Commissioner notes 125 differences during the week, 41 of which are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus. The majority of these cases still arise in the engineering, shipbuilding, and metal trades. The total number of differences reported in May is 554, a number considerably lower than those noted for previous months.jfeucWith reference to the extension of the recent dockers5 award to Ireland a Conference has been arranged to be held in Belfast on the 4th June.G.
