VDWtelB Io THh PROPERTY M HIb BRjCTAjfglO iviAJEfrTY13 ^Onmmm).w t) &amp;o r e t;  4 Li    Q ^ B I fl E t.Re ma rice by the Prime Minister on tho Adjutant-Goneral&apos;s Ueniorsmdumdated 14th May, 19 ipTT jj. rfA&amp;Wf.1.    Tho Secretary of utate for ftar has recently circulated to the War Cabinet a Memorandum on the maintenance of tho i^rmy in franco, covering a Soto by the Chief of tho Imperial General Staff and a Memorandum by the Ad jutant-General, (G.T.4598), It is with this latter alone that these remarks deal,,8.     Tho Ad jut ant -Gene ral1 s Memorandum commences with an enuraera-tion of tho representations on tho subject of man-power made by tho Army Council to the War Cabinet during &quot;the last twelve months,    Written from a Departmental point of view this Summary conveys a distorted impression of the man-power problem with which the Government was at this time confronted.     It points out at every stage tho difficulties of the Army in regard to men, and the proposals (few of them particularly helpful) which wore made &quot;by the War Office to overcome them; but it ignores tho difficulties of tho nation in regard   to men, and the reasons why the Army*8 demands couTd^not be met in full; for example, beyond a passing reference to&quot;Jthe drain upon the rapidly diminishing man-power of the Army by civil and industrial departments&quot; and to &quot;the departments by which those youths wore protected&quot; there is not the barest hint of the man-power difficulties due to tho submarine war and tho far-reaching policy which the Government wore compelled to adopt in order to meet it*   The Memorandum recapitulates the many warnings given by the Army Council in regard to tho situation that would be created if men were not furnished; it is entirely silont about the warnings given by tho Head of the Government and the War Cabinet in Juno and July, 1917, in regard to the difficulty of releasing the numbers required for tho Array and the need for tho adoption of a military policy designed to economise man-power.     (Possibly this is duo to these warnings not having been passed on to the Ad jutant-General by tho Chief of tho Imperial General Staff).-    The Memorandum contains no suggestion of any connection between the fighting policy of the Military Authorities and their man-power situation -perhaps because none existed; for examplei as will be shown bolow, the $landers offensive was deliberately adopted by the Military Authorities at a time when the Adjutant &quot;-Gene ral was giving grave warnings about the man-power prospects^ and it was continued long after the situation,- which the Ad jut ant-Gene ral had apprehended, -had developed.     It almost ignores the series of measures adopted as the result of the Cabinet Inquiry commenced at tho end of last year, which included the Military service amendment Act and tho complicated series of negotiations with the Trades Unions.. And finally the Adjutant-General&apos;s Nummary in Part I of his Memorandum does not contain the barest mention of the long dip-lomatio tussle.to relievo our man-power situation by securing the oo-operation of American battalions in British brigades, which began during Colonel House1s visit at tho beginning of December, 1917, and. after- groat exertions on. tho part of the Government, is at last producing rosults.
^ 3 33,     In these days of precise and accurate records, it would, not he right to allow so laconic and one-sided a statement as .,: that of the Adjutant General to stand on record by itself, and I have therefore directed the Secretary of the War Cabinet to preparejfrom a wider point of view the attached Notes on the man-power situation which faced the Government during &quot; the period covered by the Adjutant General&apos;s Summary.(G.T.4679.A,), These documents should, therefore, have the same distribution as the Adjutant General^ Memorandum and , be filed with it,4.     If the Secretary&apos;s Summary is, examined, it will be found that, in May 1917, where the Adjutant-General&apos;s Summary commences, the military situation, if not satisfactory, at any rate, contained no elements of actual danger.   During the previous few months the Germans had voluntarily evacuated a great tract of Allied territory, while Arras and the Chemins des Dames had been recovered by hard fighting.   The British Array was preparing for farther offensives, fitst at Meseinee, and , subsequently, in Flanders..   There was no suggestion of defensive or of danger in the military situation. The only real danger at this time was from submarine attacks In the previous month the British mercantile losses from submarines had alone e^ec^d 500, OOO gross tons, and. the wo*ld&apos;s losses were in excess of 850,000 gross tons.   The War Cabinet wefe constantly receiving most serious warnings from the Admiralty.    The situation was critical to the last degree, and it is hardly too much to say that defeat was staring the coalition in the face.   It was only by most drastic action that the situation was saved and that we are now in a position of relative security.   Naval construction and submarine mining were pushed on as Rapidly as possible *   A great programme of mercantile construction was set on foot,    A great agricultural programme to render the nation and the Army less dependent on imported supplies was adopted.   With the same object, timber-felling, both in France and in England, was undertaken on a large scale.   The development of home supplies of ore was extended.   In our docks measures were taken to secure a quioker turning round of ships.   Every one of these measures was in operation in May 1918, and every one involved a drain on our man-power,The position in Bay la summed up in the following extract from a Meeting of the War Cabinet held on May 1, 1917:-&quot;Finally, the prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that we had no reserve of man-power sufficient to sustain a combat with the bulk of the German reserves, until the United States of America could bring their strength to bear.   He reminded the War Cabinet that, to maintain our shipping at the barest minimum required to sustain the War, we required to realise a building programme of 3,000,000 gross tons, and we could not afford that men should.be recruited from this or from the connected trades. Shipping was, at present, our weakest flank, and we could not afford to take men from shipbuilding.   On the contrary, he had almost come to the conclusion, as the result of his inquiries during the past week, that we should be obliged to withdraw men from the Army for this purpose.&quot;5.    The Adjutant ^-General tells us that, on the 31st May, 1917, certain proposals were made which closely resemble the steps that v/ere &quot;only taken in April l&apos;:0 8,&quot;     It is fortunate, indeed, thatlie is able to record this; even now, with dilution far advanced, with the nation aroused by a greatnational
national emergency, and the submarine situation far less acute, it is with the utmost difficulty that the nation can hear the strain of these  -measures.     Indeed, it is not yet certain that it can bear this great burden.     It is certain, however; that if they had been adopted in May 1917, instead of &quot;only in April 1918&quot;, they would have resulted in absolute disaster.     It is equally certain that a great part of the men would have become casualties in the Flanders battle, and that this priceless reserve would not now be available.6.     The second phase of the Adjutant-General&apos;s .summary records the representations he made on the . man-power question in July and August,.1917* Incidentally, I observe, from the Secretary&apos;8 Memorandum, that on August 1 the question of man-power was delegated to a Cabinet Committee under the Presidency of Lord tillmt, which wa3 given full and final powers, on behalf of the War Cabinet, to decide, in consultation with the Departments conoerncd, all questions of recruiting and man*power, and that this is the tribunal before which the Adjutant-General^ representations muBt, in the ordinary course of events, have come.     I do not wish, however, to dwell on the work of Lord Milner&apos;s Cpmraittee, valuable ao it was, since the Committee naturaliy devoted itself mainly to important questions of detail,    Prom the point of view of the Government&apos;3 policy in regard to man-power, this phase calls to my mind rather a different train of thought.     It is true the shipping position as regards submarines was still fraught with danger, and that the policy adopted to frustrate the enemy1s designs was Btill in full swing.     The point, however, to which it is desired to draw attention is that about this time the Government seriously warned the Military Authori-ties of the danger of the manpower situation and the necessity of adapting their military policy to&quot;it. Prom the extracts given in the Secretary1s Memoran* dura, the Army Council oan assure themselves that so far as the Government were concerned, the Adjutant-General^ warning had not fallen on deaf ears.7.     It will be useful to recall the circumstances in which the Governments warnings were given, f Cabinet Committee on War Policy was anxiously examining, in the utmost detail, with the Naval and Military Authorities, the plans for the remainder of the year.     Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig with General Sir William Robertson&apos;s support was pressing for the Flanders offensive./The Government.
The Government did not conceal their mis-givingo in regard to this particular plan.   They felt, however, that they could not take the responsibility of overriding their technical military advisers.&quot;Speaking for himself,&quot; said the Prime Minister,&quot; and he had little doubt that his colleagues agreed with him in this, he considered it would be too great a responsibility for the War Policy Committee to take the strategy of the War out of the hands of their military advisers.&quot;       -  -Nevertheless, before giving their consent to a plan,&apos; in which they had little confidence^ they felt it their duty to open their whole mind to their Military Advisers,      This was done at a series of Meetings.      It would be beyoud the scope of this Memorandum even to sumaavi.se the whole of the case that was made against the Flanders offensive, or the advantages that were put forward in favour of the two alternative policies which the Government suggested for the consideration of their Military Advisers, namely, a series of lesser offensives, suoh as General Petain advocated, or an bperation on the Italian front.     whoever wishes to study this can read it in the Report of the Cabinet Committee on War Policy (G.-179), or in the more detailed Proceedings of that Committee in the custody of the Secretary of the War Cabinet.     It must be mentioned, however, that their preoccupations in regard to the adequacy of our man-power was one of the main reasons of criticism of the policy of the Flanders offensive, and was also one of the main arguments of those who advooated the alternative policy of sending guns to Italy and striking a blow for Trieste, thereby using Italian man-power, which was ample, instead of British man-power, which was failing.    What warning could be more weighty than the following, uttered in the presence of General Robertson and Field Marshal Haig by the Prime Minister on June 19, 1917 ?/&quot;The Prime
&quot;The prime Minister asked General Robertson and Sir Douglas Haig to realise our own difficulties in regard to man-power.   We were reduced, to the point where wo had to scrape up men where wo could.   Every time we scraped any in there was trouble in the House of Commons or a strike.   The last strike, which had. been due to calling up men from munition works, had lasted three weeks, and had seriously put back the output of Sir Douglas Haig*s guns.   Then we had ordered a medical rc-examination of rejected men.   The result of this was that, on Thursday, in the House of Commons, there would be the severest attack on the V/nr Office that had y-.t been delivered. If we dip in one place for recruits they said:   No, these are agricultural men; and so it was every where.   All the newspapers, without regard to party, joined in the agitation.   There was no place from which we could take men in large quantities without facing a serious trouble, He could assure Sir Douglas Haig that the Committee woremost anxious to support him.&quot;  .........&quot;He wanted the country to be able to last.   He did not want to have to face a peace Conference some day with our country weakened while America was still overwhelm-ingly strong, and Russia had perhaps revived her strength. He wanted to reserve our strength till next year.   He quite understood Sir Douglas HaigVs point of view, but the Committee had to consider whether it would not be better to hold our hand until the French Army had been resuscitated by the intervention of America.&quot;Again, on June 21st, the prime Minister sumiicd up the whole case against the Flanders offensive for the benefit of Field-Marshal Haig and General Robertson, who were then, asked to re-examine- the whole question most carefully and return to the Committee with their considered opinion.   In the course of his charge the prime Minister said the following:-\ &quot;. ww&apos;&apos;, : V : &apos;       :: :--&quot;&apos;\H:y&apos;:--.&apos;..-/ W\wW: &apos;. ;Viy v &apos;-&apos;-.-&quot;w;:.&apos; : \:&apos;W.:;: 0 w---r -&apos;&apos;e&apos;f-CV--/..&quot; -v&apos;:-&apos;&quot;It was true that you might conceivably obtain a success, namely, the- clearance of the Belgian Coast.   The chances,, however, were against such a success.   The cost in human life would be very heavy, and failure would re-act widely at homo and abroad, while the Army would be &apos; seiiovsV weakened,&quot;The prime Minister then continued by a reference to the results of the German attack on Verdun on the moral of the German people, which had thereby been reduced to a low ebb, with universal discouragement and loss of confidence in the German Military Advisers.   Continuing, he said:-&quot;The success had been merely one of capturing posts, but there had been an entire failure to capture the real objective.   This was precisely what he feared in connection with the forthcoming attack, namely, that it would lower the moral of the people,. weaken the Army, and, above all,, undermine confidence in the Military Advisers, on which the Government acted.&quot;8.     The Report of the Cabinet Committee on War Policy did not deal at great length with the question of   Han-power, but it summarised the main facts, namely:-,&quot;(a) The monthly intake of recruits for General Service during the present year has been far below the estimates, and is not sufficient to replace the wastage involved in offensive operations;
&quot;Sir Douglas Haig did not agree in the suggestion that that British Army would be exhausted by this operation, and urged that if we did not attack this year the enemy would, and we should probably lose the same number of men and guns without any advantage.&quot;9.     The above extracts ;;ro sufficient to show that it was not the Government which neglected tho Adjutant-General1s warnings.   They prnm that the gravity of the man-powar situation was most strongly urged by the Government on their Kilitary Advisers as one of the many factors to be considered before thoI , Flanders&quot; (&quot;b) Although Ken of suitable age exist in ample numbers, it hriB hitherto proved impossible to secure them for the Array.   This is due partly to the fact that they are engaged in business vital to the conduct of the War, ouch as shipbuilding, munitions, coal, or food production, and partly to the intense opposition to their withdrawal from those industries, which has resulted in serious strikes, exercising an appreciable effect on the output of essential war material:&quot;51.   These difficulties may eventually be overcome,but the impossibility of replacing heavy casualties immediately after they occur is a factor that cannot be ignored in an examination of our War Policy.   In this connection, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the Committee on the 19th June, that :-&quot;The Army in France was 20,000 to 30,000 men below establishment.   Between that date end the middle of August, the War Office hoped to be able to send out 150,000 men.   He considered the position, however, to be sufficiently favourable to justify undertaking the operations in the manner proposed by the Field marshal Commending-?n* Chief, that is to say, to proceed methodically and consider the situation before talcing each boundLater on, in the part of the Report devoted to a Summary of the criticisms of the Flandr-rs. offensive the following passage occurs:-&quot;Failure to achieve success would produce disastrous loss of confidence everywhere, and depression at home, particularly if accompanied by heavy losses.   Zmphaais was also loid on the importance of not exhausting our Reserves of man-power before the united States could bring their strength to bear.&quot;The reply to the above criticism was given as follows:-&quot;The method of attack wns also calculated to reduce casualties as far as possible.   Sir Douglas Haig pointed out that the heavy losses in the Arras fighting did not occur in the original battle, but were due to the fact that the British Army had had subsequently to keep on attacking the enemy wit!&apos;&quot; the object of wearing him down and holding him to his position,.&apos;  This necessity should not arise in the proposed operations.   An attach would not be commenced until all preparations were complete.&quot;
$landers offensive was undertaken, although, on a review of the whole situation, General Robertson and Field-Marshal Haig were not deterred thereby from adhering to their original advice.   Whether the Flanders offensive was ever discussed by the Army Council in relation to the man-power problem, or what oorjc&amp;cions   were reached docs not appear from the Papers before the War Cabinet.10.   V7ith these sole-ran warnings before them as to the extra-ordinary difficulties which   encountered any attempt to secure addition.&apos;.! men for the Army in large numbers; with their actual experience of a diminishing intake of recruits; with their knowledge of the submarine danger,and of the programme which they.knew tho Government hud adopted under stress of absolute necessity to combat it; with all this in their mind it might have been supposed that they Army Council would have dome something to limit the losses in tho autumn of 1917.   Such was not the case.   The Adjutant-General&apos;s Memorandum shows that, in August, October, November, and December, the cry for more men was continuous.     It does not record any suggestion that the losses should be curtailed by an alteration in the military plan.   Throughout the wet and dreary months of Autumn 1917 the hopeless Flanders offensive was continued, the efforts of tho Army being employed oven more on overcoming mud than in overcoming the enemy.   The losses were very heavy. For example, for the month of October alone, tho War Cabinet Minutes report that the casualties wort over 111,000,compered the War Office return states, with a normal average monthly casualty - list of 35,000 when then wns no severe fighting. (War Cabiiet 265, Minute 6).     For was the fighting confined to Flanders.   Towards the end of ITovcmbor, n now attack was launched in the Cambrai area, which with the German reaction which it provoked, resulted in a heavy casualty list,11.   At the beginning of September a decent opportunity for withdrawing from the Flanders offensive, which had already been largely spoilt by rain, was afforded by GemsralL Foch&apos;s suggestion to send guns to Italy for the exploitation of General Cadorna&apos;s striking success.   Any such suggestion, however, was strongly opposed by the Gem ral Staff,   General Maurice considered that:-&quot;To abandon our offensive at this stage would be dis-astrous for the moral of our troops and would amount to a Gorman victory,M     (War Cabinet 224, hinute 17(d)),General Robertson&apos;s view on the following day confirmed General Maurice^ opinion on this point, and expressed his own view that:-&quot;It would be false strategy to close down the offensive on the Western front in order to give General Cadorna support which would only reach him too late to be effective.&quot;12,   I do not propose to deal with the later stages of tho Adjutant-General&apos;s Summary, as tho Government&apos;s policy so far as it had developed prior to the offensive is fully explained in tho Revised Draft Report of the \7or Cabinet Committee on Kan-power,   I must, however, demur to the following statement in paragraph 12;-&quot;The arguments which had been advanced against taking legislative action for the provision of men wore mainly;-&quot;(a) The fact that the Allies were shown to benumerically stronger than tho Central powersiM(b) That the moral of the German troops was on tht decline.&quot;
Ihis lAUer^rljrlrirNur^^ by Piold Mar***l K*i .In -mentienlng tlai* argument alotoe the AdJuian**Geuerml (unintentionally, no doubt), had given the impression that xt was % paramount one in the Governraouvs M^uHPowr polioy.  As aWtter of fact, the reasons, as will bo seen from the Draft Report on Man-power, were Infintaely wider reaching, resulting, as thoy did, from an inquiry extended over the whole field of man-power, namely,nUAtaiy.naval, shipping, shipbuilding, munitions, docks, ooal, agriculture, railways, labour ooneiderations, and a review of the probable military results of the application of Compulsory Military Service to Ireland.13,   To sum up the historical aspects of the man-power question, it will be seen that the impression created by the Ad Jut ant- General1 s Memorandum is an entirely false one.   This impression, is, if the -Memorandum is considered alone, that of a curmudgeon government declining, without reason, the demands upon which the safety of the Army depended,I have shown however, that the Government had an infinitely wider responsibility than the Array Council,   Besides the Army they had to maintain the $avy, the keystone of our whole war effort; the Boro entile marine * without  whloh the nation, the Array and the Allies, would wither away; the nation&apos;s output, on which depended the Army and the Allies; the blockade - a most important though economical part of our war effort, for whloh ooal and ships are an important bargaining factor.  On a review of all these considerations the Government, while giving the Army all the men it oould, found it impossible to meet every demand.   !They told the Army so in plain language.   They could net take the responsibility of overruling the Army Chiefs in regard to the strategy of the war, of which th$ Military Authorities had always claimed to be the sols judge, (an attitude in which they had the support of public opinion), but they made the strongest representations to them to adopt a polioy less wasteful of man-power and to oonserve their strength until 1918, If the records of this time are studied, it will be found that $very development affecting the manpower question which has subse-quently occurred w foreseen in Vmm warnings! e*g, - the fact that the frenoh would not co-operate with all their strength; the resulting German concentration against the British Army, rendering inevitable the failure of the $landers offensive; the terrible losses and the consequent material snd moral weakening of the Army, and the disastrous effects on our manpower; the collapse of Bussia, and the great concentration of German forces in the West in 1918; the slow arrival of the Americans; and the need for conserving our strength to secure the Western front in the meantime.   There is not one point missing from the Govermenfs warnings of 1917,   The Army Chiefs treated them with disdain.   They were always ready to ask tho Government for men, and to warn the Government of the danger of not providing them, but never to adopt a policy of husbanding their man-power, or to apply their warnings to the matters under their own con-trol.   In perfect good faith they exaggerated the damage they could do to the enemy, and underrated the re-action of failure on our own, army.   In spi&amp;f of the Governments misgivinga they persisted in their advice to undertake the Flanders offensive, and the Government had practically no alternative but to give their consent.   They brushed aside the opportunity given them at the end of August to break off in Flanders and to exploit General Cadorna&apos;s suoocss* mainly with artillery.   As though no man-power problem existed, they continued to force the pace throughout the autumn months in Flanders in spite of the weather and at great sacrifice of men, and wound up with Cambrai,  Apart from the material and moral effect of the llandera offensive on our army, the effect on training should not be overlooked,   The recent German successes are due. on the whole, less to numbers than to their system of intensive training by means of which a relatively small number of machine gunners, by infiltration into the lines of the Allies, have succeeded on occasions In forcing whole divisions to retreat,  A corresponding intensive training of .the British foroes was rendered impossible by the demands of the Handera offensive on the time and energy of the troops.   It is legitimate to ask what the difference would have bsan in the man-power position to-day if they had taken the Government&apos;s advice; if the ?1 oncers offensive/
had novor boon begun: or if It had boon broken off at tho end of August or September,   When unfortunately, their foro-bodings had come true tho Government spared no offort to restore tho situation by passing the Military Sorvioe Act, by undertaking tho concurrent negotiations with the Trade Unions, by inducing the Americans to put their battalions in British brigades, and finally by tho drastic steps taken after the reverse on March 21st.   These are somo of the factors which must be considered in any historical review of our man-power &apos; in the period covered by the Adjutant-General&apos;3 Memorandum.Parts II and III of the Adjutant-General&apos;s Memorandum have been dealt with statistically &quot;by the Minister of National Service (Paper G.T. 4618), and it is not proposed to discuss them in any detail hers.   It may be observed,   however, that Part III of the Memorandum would have been more useful if the whole of the calculations had been based on the assumption of the incorporation of American infantry and machine-gun units, instead of remitting this aspect of tho question to tho somewhat hypothetical estimates in tho last paragraph.   When the Adjutant-General1 s Memorandum was written, the incorporation of the American infantry had for some time been tho accepted policy of the British and American Governments.   Indeed, it formed an essential part of the Government&apos;s man-power policy, and the absence of all reference to this source of man-power renders paragraphs 23 to 26 entirely misleading.   In paragraph S3, for example, the Adjutant-General estimates that in July, 1918, there will only be sufficient men in the Army at home and overseas to admit of the Infantry of a maximum number of 25 British Divisions being maintained in franco at full strength; that there is no prospect -until September, 1918, of an increase in this number of Divisions; that by the end of October, 1918, it may be possible to increase the number of Divisions up to as many as 33, which, with Irish drafts, may be raised in the same month to 37, with %6 by tho end of December, 1918.   So far as I em able to judge, theso forecasts are valueless.   Tho American troops are arriving in such large numbers that, even alter the withdrawal of the American Infantry of several British Divisions to the Alsace-Lorraine frontier, tho British cadres Divisions are being rapidly filled up.   Further, throe cadre Divisions are to be brought home and to be filled up withT^ men, stiffened by &quot;A&quot; men withdrawn from Ireland.   So far as 1 can foresee,all our Divisions will be re-filled either by American or British troops (a proportion of whom will be &quot;B&quot; man) until such time a3 the Military Service Amendment Acts begin to produce drafts in considerable numbers.15. Finally, the question arises as to whether tho Army has made the best possible use of the Man-Power that ha3 been given to it. It is an admitted fact that the numbers of men for the Army have greatly increased since tho 1st January, 1917, but it is also admitted that the infantry have been reduced.   The Government supply, the largest numbers of men for tho Army that they can, but they    ieave it to the Army to distribute thorn between the different arms.   It is tho business of tho Army to get the best value that it can out of the men.   If it considers that better fighting value is obtained from artillery, machine-guns, aeroplanes, trenchmortars, tanks, poison gas, and other mechanical adjuncts, than by devoting the same personnel to infantry, tho Army is no doubt right to make this allocation.   Apart from labour for manufacture, a heavy gun may require to keep it in action, a certain amount of labour to unload the ships and put the ammunition on the rails; more labour to transport it to the front; to take it off the rails and to put it on to motor-lorries and to build it up into dumps at the right places; and finally to fight the
May 28th, 1918.gun Itself; it la conceivable that the military man-powtr required to maintain one large gun may in the aggregate equal that of, say, an infantry oompany.   It is for the Army and not for the Crovemment to say whether it gets better value out of that one heavy gun than out of the infantry oompany which is its equivalent in man-power.   But, provided that the Government has supplied the aggregate numbers, the Army must not complain if there is a shortage in ono particular arm.   And this train of thought suggests the inquiry as to whether the Army has combed it3elf adequately.   There has been a constant implioation in the Army Counoil&apos;s Memoranda that the nation is keeping too many men for Its Supply and transport Services, even though a huge proportion of these Services are devoted to manufacturing and transporting the material needs of the Army and the raw materials for manufacturing these needs.   The question arises as to whether the Army could not do more itself to comb out its own Supply and Transport Services.   For example, it Is sometimes alleged by persons vsho have seen a good deal of tho British and French Armies that the French Supply Services are manned on a different scalo and by a  different class of man from the British corresponding Services.    Only a few days ago a caBe was brought to my notice where an Englishman who was rejected by the Army, had enlisted in the French Red Cross and had driven a oamion for the last two yoars, and is still driving it in the danger zone, and I have been told that in the ^renoh Army coloured labour is considerably employed for such Services.   The following infoimation would be of interest and should be furnished:-(1)   The number of category A. and B. men in tho Army in France employed in arms other than the infantry:(2)   The extent to jsnich these men could be replaced by ocloured labour or men of lower categories.(Intd.)   5.
