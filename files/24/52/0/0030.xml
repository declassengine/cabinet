Politloal Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.Confidential.Russia/005.7,5,18*MEMORANDUMonTHE REVOLT IN THE UKRAINE.Events in the Ukraine have taken their inevitable coursSince the first Revolution of March 1917 there have been fourprominent elements in the Ukraine:-   (1) The big landowners -Russians and Poles - who are monarchist and centralist.(2) The Rada or Ukrainian Nationalists, chiefly consistingof Ukrainian intellectuals.   (3) The chief Sovyets, representingthe working classes in Kiev, Kharkov and other towns.   (4) Thepeasant masses, the overwhelming majority of the population.During 1917 the Revolution in the Ukraine developed upon lines similar to that in Petrograd and Moscow.   The party of the landowners and centralists immediately lost its position and was replaced by the Nationalist bourgeois Rada, which developed socialist principles.   The Rada reaohed the maximum of its apparent power in December 1917 soon after the Bolshevik Revolution, when it threw off all connection with Russia and declared the Ukraine an Independent RepublicDuring January Ukrainian delegates, representing the Rada. negotiated with the Central Powers at Brest hitovsk behind the backs of the Russians, and on February 9 concluded a separate peace, thus leaving the Russians in a much weaker position during the final stages ?f the peace negotiations. Meanwhile in the Ukraine itself the Rada was rapidly losing any influence it might hitherto have had, and, by the time peace was concluded on February 9, Kiev was in the hands of the Bolsheviks and the Rad a was nothing more than a figure-head
The growth of Bolshevism in the Ukraine was slower than in the rest cf Russia.   In November, when the Bolsheviks captured Petrograd and Moscow, the local Sovyets made a bid for power in Kiev but failed, and Bolshevism did not succeed in over-throwing the Rada until February.   The Rada thus remained nominally in power for three months after Kerenski1s fall, not because it had more influence over the masses but because its problem was much simpler than that with which Kerenski was confronted.   Kerenski. as a Socialist, was in favour of a far-reaching programme of social reform, but he had also a war programme that made the co-operation of the Cadets and others essential.   It was because of the failure of his war programme, i,e, the failure to get peace, and the suspicion that by supporting the landowners he would not be able to give the land to the peasants, that Bolshevism became a force strong enough to overthrow him.   In the Ukraine the problem was simpler. The Rada had no separate war programme apart from Russia and was thus more free to develop the social programme demanded by the masses.   Thus in Kovember, taught by the fall of Kerenski, the Rada introduced land legislation of the most sweeping character) expropriating the landlords and handing their estates over to the peasants.   The Polish and Russian big landowners protested &quot;in vain;   they had no one outside the Central Powers who could support them.Thus Bolshevism was unnecessary in the Ukraine for the simple reason that the peasants had got all they wanted.   They cared nothing for the Rada, and, so long as it did not support the landowners, they could treat It with indifference.   They probably neither knew nor cared anything about the Bolshevik programme, which would only have any force in big cities such as Kiev and Kharkov,   It was not until the coming of the Germans
that BolghayjfcN bCCamo a force in the Ukraine.The Germans entered Kiev in tho beginning of March, and, since then, have occupied practically the whole of the territory claimed by the Rada, including most of the Crimea.   It was not long before disputes arose between the Rada and the Germans. The original leaders of the Ukrainians in Kiev during 1917 soon disappeared.   So far as we know Petlyura, Minister of Way, resignod almost at once when he found himself a mere tool in the hands of the Germans.   Vinnichenko, the former Prime Minister, seems to have disappeared, while Hrushevski, the President of the Rada, vainly attempted to assert the authority of the Rada. Other Ukrainians of less note, chiefly recruited from Ukrainian prisoners of war in Germany - probably mere adventurers bought by Germany - were found to take their places and -keep up the pretence of a Ukrainian Government so long as it suited the Germans,   Under this regime an extreme policy of Ukrainisatlon appears to have been adopted and, according to various reports, a large number of Ukrainian and German speaking officials were imported from the Austrian Ukraine.Increasing pressure has been brought to bear upon the Rada by the Germans during the last month.   Not only have the German food demands increased, but they have insisted that the Ukrainians must raise troops to fight against the Entente, Sevryuk, the Ukrainian Minister in Berlin, complained bitterly to his Government on April 2 about the attitude of the Germans. Kuhlmann had told him flatly that the Ukrainians were expected to assist in the task of defending Germany.   Eight army corps were to be formed from the Ukraine and men of the 1919, 1920 and 1921 classes were to be called up.The breaking point, however, only came when the Germans, feeling it was time to throw off the mask, abolished the land
programme of the Rada.   The Germans had already taken measures to forestall whatever resistance the Rada might attempt to put up, and several Ministers - the names are not given - were arrested.   At the same time a new Ukrainian Government made its appearance, a Government which has hastened to adhere to the Brest Litovsk peace and to the arrangements concluded for supplies of grain to the Central Powers.   It has further declared that free commerce will be granted in favour of Germany and Austria, and that it regards it as one of its first and most important tasks to conclude a long-term economic agreement with the Central Powers.The only news we have of the personnel of the new Government Is that the Ukrainian Dictator, the Hetman General Skoropadski is a &quot;convinced pro-German11.   This is of course the German account.   Baron von dem Bussche has stated that in the new Government none of the Ministers will stand for Great Russian or Polish aspirations.   In other words even if Great Russians or Poles are included in the Government it will be understood that they have agreed to co-operate with the Germans for the present on purely social grounds, and that they will not raise any political questions - which might be inconvenient to the Germans. The position of the Russian and Polish landowners in the Ukraine is a desperate one.   Under present conditions the social reasons which bind them to the Germans appear to be stronger than the political reasons which keep them apart.     The opposition to the Germans, therefore, will come from the peasants and from the Rada, though the latter has probably by this time lost any influence it may ever have possessed.Whatever may be the actual composition of the new Government it must support the landowners against the peasants. The latter, therefore, will have nothing left but to wage a ferocious guerilla
warfare for the lands of which they have already taken possession.   To judge from the character of the Ukrainian peasant, the struggle will be of a far more obstinate character than would be the case in Russia proper.7.5.18.
