Confidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(22nd May 1918.)I circulate the following notes, which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions, on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I. STRIKES.Statistics for the Week ending the 15th May.During the week ending the 15th May, 11,621 working days were lost through strikes on Ministry of Munitions work. The figure is practically the same as for the preceding week and represents one-fourteenth of 1 per cent, of possible working time. Two strikes accounted for four-fifths of the time lost: a thousand gun fitters at the works of the Austin Motor Co., Limited (Birmingham), lost 3,750 days, and three thousand employees of Messrs. A. V. Roe &amp; Co., Limited (Manchester), lost 5,548 days.Temper of Munition Workers.The general labour situation continues tranquil. Bubbles of unrest come up from time to time in different localities, but in most cases they have broken harmlessly at the surface. The only disputes which menaced output at Whitsuntide during weather which was itself a temptation to strike were not without provocation. At Birmingham, in the case already mentioned, an employer sought to reduce a bonus, but received no countenance from the employers&apos; federation, and was induced to surrender an untenable position. The matter has, however, not yet been finally settled. The other affair was at Woolwich, caused by the tactless and noisy denunciations of his fellow-workers by a &quot; patriotic &quot; poseur, George Stubbs. The intervention of the Ministry was required in order to prevent the protests of the workers from translating themselves into a stoppage of work to enforce the removal of Stubbs.IL-WAGES IN THE BUILDING TRADES.The regulation of wages in the building trades, in which competition by employers has assisted the demands of the men to produce inconsistent rates, has involved much difficulty. For a year and a half, an interdepartmental committee has dealt with the subject,.but while it has done much useful work in ascertaining facts and in making practical recommendations, its operations have suffered from the fact that it possessed, in the last resort, no power to enforce its conclusions. For a time it seemed practic-able to allow the fixing of rates to be effected by conciliation procedure between the parties in cases where resort was not had to arbitration, but eventually it was found that the steadying and restraining influence of a central authority was desirable in order to prevent excessive and inconsistent scales of pay. In these circumstances, an Order is about to be issued which will invest the Ministry of Munitions with the necessary powers of central control, and will render its assent indispensable where the parties, in lieu of arbitrating, come to an agreement inter se. The Committee will continue to function with Sir George Askwith as chairman and Professor Macdonald as vice-chairman, and for dealing with special cases will have an Executive over which also Sir George Askwith will preside. In sanctioning wage claims in the building trades, or in refusing to sanction them, the Ministry looks forward to being guided by the advice of this Committee.x   (83)5827   Pk20   125   5/18   E    S
III.-WELFARE ADVISORY COMMITTEE.Problems of capital importance to the health and well-being of munition workers constantly present themselves, and in future the Minister of Munitions, in attempting , their solution, will have the advice of an interdepartmental advisory committee under the chairmanship of Mrs. H. J. Tennant, C.H. Among the practical questions to which : the attention of this Committee will shortly be directed are the employment of ll 1  a women patrols and their relation to the professional police; creches, in the light of 1$^   the counter-demand of a certain section of the workers for the endowment of motherhood; and the shortage of midwives in thronged industrial centres.IV-RECRUITING OP MUNITION WORKERS.In these notes* certain figures have been given as to the acceleration of the calling up of munition workers for the Army. It should be observed that the figures of men &quot; released &quot; there given necessarily exceed the number of men actually posted to units in the army during the same periods. Some interval must elapse between the time when a man&apos;s name is handed to the recruiting authorities and the time when he reaches the Army. Men can appeal to Enlistment Complaints Committees or to tribunals, or their employers may protest against their removal. Changes of employment (especially since leaving certificates were abolished) whether in the ordinary course or with deliberate intent to evade the recruiting officer, cause much delay and an actual loss of recruits.10th April, 24th April, hsth Mny.
