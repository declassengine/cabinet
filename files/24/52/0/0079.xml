(THIS BOOTOM IS THE PROPTOY Og EI3 BRITAOTIC MAJBSgYlg GrOYERBMBHT).3 B 0 H E 1, .WAR    CABINET. -CENSORING   03?   PEOTQgPAPHB * (War Cabinet 410, Minute 2.)Bote &quot;by the Secretary;.In accordance with War Cabinet 410, Minute 2, in which I was re quested to enquire as to what organisation existod for censoring illustrated papers.    I have made  -enquiries of the different Departments concerned.The Press Bureau state that they have ample authority   -to deal with photographs that might, if published, he of use to the enemy, always provided that the photographs are submitted to thorn before publication.    Such photographs, however, are not necessarily submitted to the Press Bureau, the censorship being voluntary.    On the other hand it appears to be difficult for a photographer to obtain photographs, especially of mechanical devices, without a permit.    Should the Press Bureau be in doubt as to the advisability of publishing any photograph they consult tho War Office or the Department interested^In regard to &quot;official photographs&quot; these are, after censorship by the General Headquarters concerned, sent through the Press Bureau v/ho finally pass them prior to publication.Photographic prints cannot be sent abroad unless stamped by the Pros3 Bureau.     It Is to be noted, however, that they may escape notice by the postal censor.Both the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Munitions appear to be satisfied with the present arrangements and the Press Bureau doubt whether there is .ahy real necessity to alter the procedure which has answered fairly well for nearly four yearsa    It is stated that any extension of control to be really effective would also have to be applied to the American, French, and Italian Press.(Signed)   M. P, A. Hankey,Secretary.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 28th May, 1918,
