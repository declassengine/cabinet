4IT.Tu40.PROPOSED PROCLAIM AT ION UNDER THE MILITARY SERVICE(NO, ,8) ,ACT. 1916.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofNational Service.I submit for the approval of the War Cabinet the attached draft of a Proclamation under Section 3 of the recent Military Service Act withdrawing certificates of exemption from men born In 1900, who are. or are found to be, in Grade I or Grade II.The object of this Proclamation is to secure for the Armed Forces all men of these Grades who attain the age of 18, and who are not engaged in the specially protected industries.My Department has been inc onsultation with the other Government Departments concerned as to whether the object in view should be secured by a Proclamation or a Decertification Order under the first Military Service Act, 1918.     The Local Government Board and the Scottish Office have both expressed the opinion, in which I concur, that it is better to proceed by Proclamation In order that the cases of those born in 1900 may be dealt with In the same way as those born between 1895 and 1899.     I therefore ask that the approval of the War Cabinet may be given, and that the Proclamation may be sub-mitted to His Majesty as early as possible..18..CECIL BECK
