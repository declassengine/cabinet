A farmer at Magdalen (Norfolk) has been fined a similar amount for non-compliance with an order of the same nature.

&apos;been fined  100 for not complying with an order to plough land. Compensation for the break in p; up of grass land - A case of some importance has recently been decided by the Defence of the Realm (Losses) Commission.     The applicant was a tenant farmer who had ploughed up 1? acres of grass land under an order of the Agricul-tural Executive Committee and claimed compensation for loss of seeds and for loss caused by having to reduce his dairy herd.     The seeds were &quot;permanent&quot; and had been sown five years and two years previously on the different fields broken up.   The applicant was not under notice to quit, and under the Kent custom he would have been entitled at the expiration of his tenancy to compensation as for the value of&quot;temporary seeds.     The dairy stock had not in fact been reduced but the applicant said he would be obliged to reduce.     The Commission declined to award any compensation on either claim and reported that the applicant had not suffered any loss by reason of interference with his property or business in respect of which any payment to him out of public funds could be determined by the Commission.Drainage of^ Lands - Work done in the Done aster area of the West Biding was inspected during the week.     The West Ivloor and Park Drains have been resectioned and regraded throughout and most of th&amp;ib subsidiary drains have been restored to efficiency.     The effect of this work ha3 been to reduce the water level by about 3 ft., and 600 to 700 acres which were practically derelict at the previous inspection in April 1917, are now in a flourishing condition under wheat, oats, potatoes and seeds.     The work is now being further extended.     Several miles of the River Torne have been cleansed of weeds, shoals and other obstructions, and the concrete dam under Aukley Bridge has been removed by the County Council at the instigation of the Department.     Some work still remains to be done in the river, but clearances already made have freed from water-logging an area amounting to 3,000 acres.     It is hoped to&apos;3 bring the greater part of this area into cultivation next autumn.

A report of serious damage to corn plante on newly-broken grassland in the Horsham area having been received an inspection was made of fourteen separate enclosures, comprising
about 100 acres, where the plant had been thinned or had. falloc1. Tho losses were found to be chiefly due to leather-jackets and slugs, but wireworms were also present.     Spring wheat, white and black oats had all suffered.     Insufficient consolidation is generally believed to have been a contributory cause of the damage.     The land had all been ploughed in early spring, but on land of-this type autumn sowing is desirable, and every effort should be made to break up grass in the summer or early autumn.    The production of winter food for stock is important, and it is suggested that steps should be taken to replace the crops which have failed this year, either by linseed or by a green forage crop.Blast Furnace Flue Pust.

Binder Twine,   In order to ensure a sufficient supply of binder twine for the coming harvest arrangements have been made for the purchase of 1,500 tons of twine held in this country for export, and also for the manufacture of about 2,500 tons in excess of the quantities originally contracted for by the Ministry of Munitions.

Arrangements are also being made to sell some of the twine to Agricultural Executive Committees for use with the Government binders.Seed Maize.   The demand for South African seed maize for sowing is falling off very considerably, but enquiries are still received from small holders who appear to be anxious to test its value as forage.Wart Disease (Potatoes).

It has been found that the cbnsign-ments In question have reached a large number of small growers.

Arrangements have been made by the Department for the supply of sixty-one horse-drawn spraying machines adapted for use in connection with charlock or potatoes.

The new machines have been allocated to 24 counties in accordance with applications received from the Committees, and 24 have already been dispatched.Seeds Stored in this Country on Foreign Account. It has been brought to the notice of this Department that certain seed firms are offering
&quot;isto book orders with foreign customers for supplies of seeds, arjj in the event of licence for export being refused, to arrange for the storage of the seeds ,in this country.As licences are only refused in respect of seeds, the supply of which is considered to be insufficient to meet home requirements, the holding up of quantities of such seeds for an indefinite period is obviously undesirable.   The Ministry of Food] has, therefore, issued an Order requiring a return to be made of parcels of seed held up in this manner.     Should it be found thatl any of this seed is of a variety needed in this country ste*ps will be taken %o arrange for it to be placed immediately on the home market.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-GeneralThe Rt. Hon..R.E. Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
