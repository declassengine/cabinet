kllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAKMIC MAJESTYj B OOv^OffTj-WAR   CABINET. 127SUPPLY   OF   BARBED   WIRE.&apos; Cepy of letter dated 23rdliay, 1918, from First Lord of.....the-IBmir aity&quot;To&quot; SeoreTary &quot;W S fatejf or f 7&apos;( CirculatedTnconnection v/IIiilfar Cabinet 415, Minute 2).iy dear Secretary of State,When I was in France J was told of a shortage of barbed wire.   I understand that before the last German offensive there were large stocks of barbed wire in France, but we have lost a great deal of it.If I am right in my understanding, the need for barbed wire to-day is very great,   I understand that barbed wire production has always been under the control of the War Office.   The capacity of this country to make the rods and draw it into wire, completing it as barbed wire, is not quite 1200 tons per week, and it runs about 6 miles to the ton, single strand, so that a maximum of 7,200 miles of barbed wire can be produced per week in this Country with existing plant.     I understand that since the offensive 11,000 tons have now gone to France.About a fortnight ago the question of barbed wire prc-duotion was, I understand, raised, and it has apparently beenagreed that owing to the predominating Admiralty interest andcontrol in wire of all kinds produced in this Country, theAdmiralty,should,,on the tfar Office behalf, extend.its control to cover&apos;the existing barbed wire productive capacity cf thisCountry, and should direct its use with the aid of a smallCommittee representative of the Admiralty, War Office, andMinistry of Munitions.   The Flying Corps also get their wirethrough the Admiralty Wire Controlling Organisation.As I understand the situation, the normal consumption of barbed wire can be met by the productive capacity of this Country, but the great quantity lost and the great demand for wire caused by new defensive lines, has made a temporary short-age.     It is impossible to do more in this Country for many months than produce the maximum of 1200 tons per week, and it is a moot point whether any additional plant should be put down in this Country to meet what I understand to be a purely temporary demand.   It has been suggested that if the present output will not meet present requirements, the best way would be to order barbed wire from America where almost unlimited quantities can be produced immediately,   I understand that 30,000 tons have already been ordered, but that is not a matter for which the Admiralty are in any way responsible.The tfar Office has asked to be allowed to place an Officer representing them in the Admiralty Wire     Department, and that has been agreed to.     The MinisUy of Munitions are helping us in every possible way by providing the billets for manufac-turing wire up to the 1200 tons which the plant of the Country can produce weekly,My object in writing.this letter is to make it perfectly clear as to hew far the Admiralty is taking responsibility for supplying the Army with barbed wire.   Ve hope to be able to give, with the assistance of the Ministry of Munitions, somethingJ
*** a!j **approximating a maximum of 1200 tons per week, and anything more which is required at the present time should he ordered either &quot;by the War Office or Ministry of Munitions, whichever is concerned.I am sending a copy cf this letter to the Minister of &quot;Munitions.Yours sincerely,(Sd.)   E.C. GEDDES1The Right Hon.Viscount kilner, G.C.B., G.CM.G,, Secretary of State for War.
