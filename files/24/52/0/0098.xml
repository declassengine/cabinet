BATTLE SITUATION - NOON - 30th MAY, 1918.

1. The Battle in CHAMPAGNE continues with great violence. The enemy have occupied SOISSONS and the greater part of RHEINS. The main thrust of the enemy is being directed on the valley of the MARNE between DORMANS and CHATEAU-THIERRY. The linE appears to run approximately as follows :- SAINT-LEONARD (south east of RHEIMS) thence along the southern bank of the AISNE CANAL to about FAUBOURG-DE-VESLE, thence through TINQUEX - THILLOIS - GERMIGNY - TRAMERY - LAGERY - VEZILLY - GOUSSANCOURT - RONCHERES. All villages mentioned from GERMIGNY to RONCHERES (both inclusive) are in German hands. German patrols are pushing forward through the FORET-de-RIS. North west of the FORET-de-RIS our line appears to run approximately as follows :- FRESNES -VILLENEUVE-SUR-FERE - CUGNY - HARTENNES-ET-TAUX - COURMELLES - MERSIN-ET-VAUX. The situation between the FORET-de-FERE and SOISSONS is however obscure. North of SOISSONS the line runs through PASLY, west of CHAVIGNY, west of JUVIGNY, CRECY-AU-M0NT-PONT-ST-MARD.

This situation was received at the Generalissimo&apos;s Head Quarters at 9.a.m.

2. On the rest of the front the situation is unchanged.
