TOTAL $ VERSION OF TRAFFIC VIA THE MGLISH CHANNELTO LONDON AND BAST COAST PORTS.WEkORANDUM BY THffi PRESIDENT OF $HE BOARD OF TRADE.In view of a possible diversion of traffic from London and other ports on the 3ast Coast, to ports on the West Coast, 1 appointed last jre&amp;r a Committee to consider what steps should be taken to provide in London and other places affected, the necessary terminal and other facilities required to admit of the diversion of traffic via the Fnglish Channel to London and other Bast Coast ports.   The Committee reported in March, 1918, and made certain recommendations which included the retention of reserve stocks in East Coast centres sufficient to meet the requirements -of consumption within those areas during the period of emergency and also sufficient warehouse accommodation at West Coast ports to take such diverted cargoes as might have to be discharged there.   The Committee also recommended certain railway facilities and certain arrangements at the ports concerned.   These recommenda-tions have been dealt with.As, however, I understand that in certain events it might  -not be possible to keep the Snglish Channel open for traffic at all, 1 asked the Committee to consider the steps that should bs taken to meet such an emergency, and I have received from them a further Report.The
The original Committee, under the Chairmanship of Colonel Pringle, R,B.-. j Chief inspecting Officer of Railways, contained representatives of the Ministry of Munitions, the Shipping Controller, the Food Controller, the Railway Executive Committee, the Pert &amp; Transit Comnittee and the Port of London Authority, and for the purposes of the further enquiry which I entrusted to the Committee, representatives of the Admiralty and War Office Were added.The Committee have sent in a Report which shows that the problem to be faced in the event of traffic via the English Channel to London and East Coast ports being entirely closed for an indefinite period, is one of considerable magnitude. The total weekly tonnage of traffic which has to be dealt with is approximately 163,000 tons.   Some of the traffic, such as are, timber, &amp;c., the Committee recommend should travel by sea by the North-about route to its East Coast destination.The Committee selected as the West Coast ports which should deal with the traffic, Liverpool, Manchester, Avonmouth, Cardiff and Birkenhead, and the demands upon these five places would involve the employment of 36 trains a day and the daily move-ment of 1,600 loaded wagons.   This will obviously affect very-seriously the existing railway traffic and services, whilst Liverpool has now to deal with-a considerable amount of American transport traffic, and while that traffic continues, cannot be used to its fullest capacity.To enable the necessary structural facilities and materiel to be provided it is essential that absolute priority should he given to the requirements involved in the scheme designed to meet the total diversion of traffic by the EnglishChannel.
These&quot; facilities include additional sidings at Liverpool and connec-tions with the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway, sidings near Manchester and at Cardiff and in the&apos;&apos;Port of London.   New junction lines at ,Thames 1Sb.arf junction on the Great Eastern Railway and the provision of locomotives and other materiel will also he required.   The total expenditure for structural and equipment facilities is estimated roughly at   10,500, and this expenditure has been sanctioned by the Treasury.I desire to put to the 7/ar Cabinet the necessity of giving instructions that will ensure absolute priority for the supply of the materiel required for the works recommended by the Committee. Priority is required in regard to sidings, rail connections, locomotives, cranes and other smaller matters.   The question has already been taken up with the various Government departments con-cerned, but I fear that, without an instruction from the War Cabinet that absolute priority must be given to the requirements to which 1 have referred, there is likely to be delay which may be serious. rff There are lying at Tilbury Docks 3*600 tons of 92 lb. flange rails with fastenings belonging to the Belgian Government.   These rails could be used in connection with the works recommended by the Committee in the Port of London.   I have been attempting to secui-e possession of the rails, but there are difficulties in the way as the Belgian Military Authorities state that the rails were obtain-ed for them through the Calais Military Railway Commission for certain strategic purposes and that they are unable to release themexcept
except with the consent of the Commission.   In these circumstances I have to ask for the authority of the \7ar Cabinet to take possession of the rails and use them for the purposes of thi works recommended by the Committee in the event of it not being possible to secure them by agreement.21st May, 1918.A.
