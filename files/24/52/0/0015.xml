\,M/instil?I circulate to the War Cabinet the attached Memorandum by the Coal Controller on the subject of the Recruitment from Coal Mines, which has been prepared following a meeting which took place at my office this morning when representa-tives of the various Departments concerned were present. The recommendations contained in it are, however, to be read as being those of the Board of Trade and not those of the other Departments represented, and I suggest that it is desirable that this important matter should be considered by the War Cabinet as early as possible in order that a decision. may be arrived at.A. H. STAJ8EEY.Board of Trade,22nd May, 1918.
REORUIBtaT PROM COAL lOKBS. i......................Memorandum by the Coal Controller;At the end of 1917 the position as regards the production of coal in this Country for ourselves and our Allies and certain neutral countries, and the shipping position, ad-mitted of the recruiting of 50,000 nen from the Mines for the Army, and accordingly it was agreed, with the concur-rence of the Coal Mines Department, that the Home Office should decertificate that number of miners.Before this number had been withdrawn from the minesit was agreed that a second quota of 50,000 men should berecruited frou the mines for the Army, provided these menwere taken from the districts in which at that time the coalposition was easy, vi2., the exporting districts, but theCoal Controller intimated to the Minister of National Servicethat he could not agree to any of these men being taken fromthe Industrial core of the Country.    At a later date the*Controller of Coal Mines advised the Minister of NationalService that he could only agree to 25,000 men being taken in the month of May.when the withdrawal of the second 50,000 was agreed it had not been intimated to the Controller that an altera-tion had taken place in the shipping conditions and that it might be anticipated that the Shipping Controller would be able to provide tonnage for a considerable increase in the exports   to JJeutral Countries beyond the figures of the previous months, nor was any -provision mads for any increased demand for the supply of coal to Srsnce which might result from a withdrawal of our line in France following upon a German offensive.The
tion the economies that might he effected in this Country in the consumption of Industrial as well as Domestic coal and using up all available stocks on hand both at Collieries and in the hands of Consumers.   These economies and use of stocks were estimated at 25,000,000 tons per annum.   The full benefit of these economies cannot be realised for some time to come, and until a system of priorities and rationing can be effectively established.Since this recruiting program was agreed the position as regards the demands for coal for export to our Allies and certain neutral Countries has materially altered and may be attributed to two causes:1,* Reduced output of the Pas de Calais mines consequent upon the recent German offensive.2.- Improved shipping position resulting in increased demands fdrr^coal to certain European neutral countries and to South America.These increased demands are estimated at roundly 11,000,000 tons per annum.     Assuming an output of 560 tons per annum per.man this increased demand will require 30,000 men in addition to&apos; the number which were contemplated when it was agreed that a second 50,000 men should be withdrawn from the mines.The disturbance caused by the comb-out in the Mines hasbeen so serious that output has suffered in all parts of the Country and the position generally is that deliveries of coal both to the Allies, neutrals and for Home consumption are considerably behind what they should be, and this is parti-cuXaiOy. the case with regard to the Industrial core ofEngland
England as all-over recruiting will most&apos;-- affect that part of the Country.   It is therefore recommended that not more than 62,500 Grade 1 pre-war miners should be posted to the Army or enlisted in the Royal Navy, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve or Royal Marines since the 1st January 1918 and that no men of lower grades should be taken from the Coal Mines other than such post-outbrear-of-rar Miners as may still remain, until such time as the full effect of the withdrawal of that number of men is determined.As soon as the German offensive started the Controller of Coal Mines consented to the medidal re-examination of all the Class &quot;Wrt Reserve Coal Miners who had already been sent back to the Mines and in the retention with the Colours of such as were placed in Grade 1.    This process isff    $ot yet -completed but has already resulted in the return to u&amp; Colours of 5,031 Miners.22nd May, 1918.GUY CALTHR03?.
