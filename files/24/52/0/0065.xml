xe&amp;ajmuiiKai^ , ,,,,,,,, &apos;    1    I&apos; &apos; ICIECa.l4TED 30 JHK K.TH) 6ND MR CABINETM E M 0 R A NDU M.Ear on Gcto*s telegram of May 19th,G.T. 4617The substance of Baron Goto&apos;s quest ions is: Are our negotiations with the Soviet likely to he successful arid, if so, is success desirable?  As a particular case, are we to refrain frail helping Semenof for fear of quarrelling with the Soviet?Colonel Wedgwoodj whom I saw on his return from the Far East, told me that the Japanese Government were very nervous about the political position in Japan, and were much afraid of a Bolshevist movement therec They therefore would he very reluctant to do anything which would give countenance to the Russian Bolshevists; and this no doubt is the real meaning of their questions0We have recently received repeated messages from representatives of the Intelligent classes in Russia saying that, if we make any agreement with the Bolshevists, we shall offend all the rest of the Russians Mr, Lockharb.has appeared, lately rather to sympathise with this opinion; and the French Ambassador, Monsieur N cull ens, takes the same view with great vigour.On the ether hand., Semenofv s movement is in, it self inconsiderahleo   He has a force variously estimated atfrom
&quot;TCr-on.2,000 to 5,000 men, ill-equipped, and probably ill-diDciplined,   rJo important result can be &quot;hoped for from the operations of such a force by itself.   It might? howeverbe of considerable importance as the advance guard of a Japanese and Allied -o-:;:edit ion.I am, therefore, in favour of telling the Japanese that we do not expect any immediate result from the negotiations between MrLockhart and the Soviets Though we have no wish to appear in Russia as tho supporters of the Soviet, yet we are equally reluctant to, appear as their opponents,. - We are anxious not to take any side in Russian internal affairst,   We should prefer to secure the acquiescence of the Soviet Govern-ment in any action we tookc   But we do not regard this as absolutely essential.  As for Semenof, we should be * very willing to extend to him such support as we could, on the understand that his operations were going to form part of a big movement by the Allies.,   But5 if he is to be left to his own isolated-exertions^ we doubt whether he can accomplish anything of importancea  At,, the same time8 even so3 we would nob refuse to join with the Japanese in giving him such assistance in money and equipment, as they shall think desirable,   I should like to be allowed to add that my Colleagues agreed with the line I took in my interview with the Ambassador,If this course is approved, it will be necessary,I
I think, to say something to the Soviet authorities. Bo far, we have told them, on April 17th. that &quot;steps  * have he en taken to restrain Semenof from making any further advance, and if he does :so nevertheless it&apos; will be on his own responsibility51 *   I think we cAhould direct Mr, Lockhart to tell the Soviet Gws: umenb that, in view of the continued German advance in Russia and the growth of German influence therei and particularly in view of the very hostile instructions given hy the Soviet Govern-menu \ in reference to Murmansk, we feel hound to warn them that we regard ourselves as free to take any steps that seem to us desirable to prevent the further establishment of German influence in any part of Russia,,   Some general phrase of that kind would, 1 think, be e&amp;cugh, without saying anything about Somonof in particular.If we do not do this, we must do one of two things. Either we -must encourage the Japanese to support Semenof, tell log them that, though we are quite willing that they should do so, we feel hound by our position with regard to the Soviet not to take our share9, which would, in my judgment, produce a very bad impression on the Japanese, and would besides expose us to something like a charge of bad faith by the Soviets   Or we could simply say to the Japanese that we adhere to our position that we must act in concert with the Soviet in Russia, and that conee-quently we could give no help, direct or indirect, toSemenof,
(4)Semenof,I cannot help feeling that such a reply would he absolutely disastrous,   It would confirm the suspicions which the Japanese undoubtedly entertain that we are not in earnest in this matter, and all the elements in Japan hostile to intervention would be strengthened *I fear it must be admitted that the Bolshevists are right in their view that any,vigorous intervention-1st policy must be fatal to their system of governmente It must aim at diverting the energies of the nation from class warfare to national warfare, and at re-establishing order and discipline in the country, Tne policy of intervention is therefore ultimately inconsistent with a policy of support for the Soviet; and our reply to Japan should be guided by a recognition of this fact.(Signed)        Robert Cecil0OFFICE, 25th May, 1918,,
