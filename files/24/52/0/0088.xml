BATTLE SITUATION - NOON - 29th MAY, 1918.

1. On the CHAMPAGNE front the enemy continues to increase his gains. At a late hour last night he entered SOISSONS, but was driven out by a counter-attack. The Battle Front now extends from RHEIMS to PONT-ST-MARD. As far as is known at present our line runs approximately as follows :- BETHENY -(immediately north of RHEIMS) CHAMPIGNY - MUIZON - COURCELLES - SAVIGNY-SUR-ARDRE- BROUILLET - DRAVEGNY - MAREUIL-EN-DOLE - MAAS-ET-VI0LAINE - AMBRIEF - SOISSONS - CAFFIES - JUVIGNY to our original front line about PONT-ST-MARD.

The junction between the IXth British Corps and the French is believed to be about SAVIGNY-SUR-ARDRE.

So far 21 German Divisions have been identified but it is thought that at least 10 more Divisions have been engaged. Prisoners state that the attack will be extended as far west as NOYON.

2. On the rest of the front the situation remains unchanged.
