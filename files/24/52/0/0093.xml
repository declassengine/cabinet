Colonel W. My Jones,1/ lit&apos;b WGVmm-Ib THE PROPERTY Otf HIS BRIMMO MAJESTY1^ QOVBRNI/SSHT). ^U J0 g E T, &apos;4691tAGRICULTURAL IROGIiUibE .JQR 1919 ; SOOTLAlP,jyiomprandum by the Secretary for bootland.The increased cultivation which will be scoured this year is expected to show a greater acreage under grain and root crops in Scotland than has ever boon tho case in the history of the country. There is therefore comparatively little room for further increase&apos; of the area to be put under cultivation, and the programme of 1919&quot; oan involve but a small extension,Pood crops may be increased, however,(a) by the cultivation of further areas of grasslands, amounting possibly to about 50,000 acres ;(b) by the more liberal use of fertilisers; (o)   by the provision of allotments.It is hoped, however, to augment tho food supply by other means, viz:-(a) by the -extension of cattle brooding in suitable areas of hill pasture;(b) by the re-stocking of door forests with sheep;(c) by the improvement of hill pastures by the application of basic slag or other suitable and available manures.The above programme will require :LABOUR:In tho Autumn and Winter 1,000 additional skilled ploughmen will be needed and 2,000 horses.     The men supplied from existing labour battalions must not ho withdrawn or substitutes must be provided.     The labour situation in Scotland is prejudiced at present in two ways(i) Men of the labour battalions who are temporarily employed in fertiliser and agricultural implement works have been withdrawn, with the result that the output of fertilisers at the most critical period of the year has decreased., a serious reduction in root crops will follow, and tho manufacture of agricultural implements which arc urgently needed will be prevented.     The men are with-druwn to barracks not to other productive work,(ii) Men and women in largo numbers are being tempted to leave the farms by the high wages offered by Government Contractors who are erecting Aerodromes and other Govern-merit buildings.   As those contractors arc paid by a per-centage on the cost of wagons and material, they can afford to pay two or three times aS; much as tho farmer, Moreover, in one district the farm labourers obtain Sunday work from local contractors at 18/- to&apos; 80/- per day, and return to the farms on Monday unfitted for ordinary duty.Strong representations have boon made by farmersfrom
from three of the most&apos; important agrlouit*Lrel--ctpeaa in Scotland to the effect that they can obtain almost no local labour for planting, weeding, etc, owing to the corn-petition of contractors.   It is pointed out that while the farmer works on a fixed price for his produce he is com-pelled to compete for his la&quot;bour with contractors to whonrHho,.. ultimate cost of the product is of no consequence or is advantageous according to its magnitude,It is suggested therefore that the National Service Department in association with :&apos;iar Office and Admiralty should arrange for a supply of labour for government con-tractorg and that those contractors should not &quot;be authorised to engage local labour from agriculture except under . authority of the National Service Department.There must &quot;be sufficient labour for the harvest. This is the chief difficulty of the Scottish farmer. Owing to the more uncertain climate and the fewer hours of daylight, the harvest is more critical than in tho south and the crops more difficult to save with a depicted staff.   Great efforts should &quot;be made to provide harvest labour &quot;by giving harvest leave to soldiers in the home Forces.   It is of the utmost importance that an early statement on tho subject should he made.   The men now in Agricultural Battalions are to a great extent absorbed in the staff of farms, and for the hay and corn harvest labour in addition to that which is now on farms must he assured.To harvest- the increased acreage of potatoes this autumn instructions should he given to School Boards te free the older children for a week or two at the lifting season.   This will give the farmers confidence to extend their cultivation in 1919.   Where School Eoards have followed this practice in the past two sensons the&quot;labour situation has been eased.   It will be necessary to issue definite orders to School Boards to act on the request of local Pood production Committees.MACHINERY.Sufficient supplies of tractors, ploughs, paraffin and petrol are in prospect, but spare parts for tractors are unprocurable.   It is a matter of urgent .necessity that spare parts should be imported at once-in sufficient numbers to replace worn out parts when tractors are overhauled in summer, and to provide for breakages during the next cultivation season.   Immediate steps  aust be taken to pro-cure these parts,BERTILISEAS;By arrangementswith the English and Irish Depart-mcnts of Agriculture the quota of the most important fertilisers duo to each country in proportion to the arable area has boon fixed, and provision is being made for cquit-ablo distribution.   The continued demand for grain will necessitate the growing of white crops for several years in succession on tho same land,   ifco do this without serious loss; of fertility, it is necessary to give liberal applications of fertilisers, and the longer the pressure for
Scottish Office, 29th hay, 1918.inoreased production continues, tho greater and raoro urgent will bo the &amp;e;:aanft for manure.    It is safe to say that a bQfji increase of the fertilisers usod last year would he profitably expended in Scotland,    Thoro cannot ho too groat a supply of Sulphate of Ammonia and Superphosphate, and special efforts should ho iaudo to ensure supplies of the latter.Under tho provisions of the Oorn Production Act, which ooiao into operation on August 21st it will not ho possible for tho Board to ensure bettor fanning or to increase cultivation without fatal delay.    It is necessary therefore that the P.O.R.A. regulations should be I   continued in operation for another year or for the duration of the war.(S(;d) ,   BOHSRT IIUHRO;
