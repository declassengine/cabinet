(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). 

Confidential.

MINISTRY OF HEALTH.

Note by the Minister of Reconstruction.

As Lord Rhondda is likely to be away for a considerable time, I circulate for the information of my colleagues a letter which I have received from him with regard to the Draft Bill for the creation of a Ministry of Health:-  CHRISTOPHER ADDISON.

22.5.18.

COPY.

Llanworn,

Newport,

Mon. 16th May, 1918.

My dear Addison,

I have now had an opportunity of reading the Draft Bill for the creation of the Ministry of Health. I entirely agree with its provisions, and for what my opinion is worth, I consider it a very well drafted measure. The omission of the words "and Local Government" in the title and the proposal for an Advisory Council are both very sound.

You are most welcome to tell the Cabinet that the measure in its present form has my hearty approval, and with some knowledge of public feeling in the matter I am satisfied its passage into law would be a most popular act on the part of the Government.

With every hope that you may succeed in getting Government sanction for its early introduction,

Believe me,

Yours very faithfully,

(Signed) RHONDDA.
