(This Document    the Property of 8 2His Britannic iV)ajtfsty&apos;s Government.]PACIFISM AND REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM(Circulated by the Homo Secretary).The tone of the working class throughout the country 1b still sound upon the War, though my Birmingham correspondent reports that the Man Power Act is being turned to some account by the Paoifista in Birmingham, Coventry, and&apos;Wolverhampton.    Two women who speak at the Bull Ring at Birmingham on &quot;immediate Peace&quot; are new allowed to hold forth without interruption, whereas a few weeks ago. they could not obtain a hearing.    From Liverpool, I hear that the International Conference, whioh waB in everybody&apos;s mouth a faw months ago, is soaroely ever referred to in the shops, nor does anyone mention &quot;Peace by Negotiation&quot;,    A working class woman who has a large circle of friends in&apos;working class homes, tells me that Peace talk is at a discount, and that everyone is watching the position on the Western Front.    She says, however, that the wilder Pacifists, Buoh as Mrs. Bamber and Miss Hickling, have now taken to visiting cafes in the city, and accosting people there on the subject of Peace.    One of these women remarked confidentially that since the ccnviotion of John McLean at Glasgow they did not think it safe to hold Meetings, but they intended to held them in her private house, where the Police could not interfere.    The usual Peace Meeting in Pembroke Chapel was not held last week, nor was the outdoor campaign of the Liverpool Independent Labour Party Branch opened, as had been publicly announced.Prom all parts of the country I hear that the Paoifists are driven to underhand activities, and these are conducted with the disregard of common honesty, which is characteristic of really good people when their feelings are aroused.    For example, at a Meeting called to discuss Regulation 40,D., and the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, the Paoifists were busy obtaining signatures to a Petition for the release of the Pacifist, Mri Arnold Lupton, and many womom were signing this Petition under the impression that it was a Petition against Regulation 40.D.    In Leeds, a favourite method is to attaok individual members of the Government with quotations from their speeches, and a re-hash of the criticisms from Socialist reviews and pamphlets, as a text for the argument that Ministers of the, Crown are &quot;bourgeois1 and unfitted to negotiate a people&apos;s Peace.   ,My correspondents all think, however, that this lull in Pacifism is due to the critical position of the relations of the working olass who are fighting in Flanders, and that as soon as the Military situation of the Allies improves, there will be a fresh wave of Pacifism-.From Newcastle and Glasgow come reports of the excellent work which is being done by the British Workers&apos; League, the Navy League, and the War Aims Committee, and my correspondents urge that this work should be continued throughout the Summer, to counteract the out-door Meetings, of the Socialists, On the 10th instant, a Pacifist Meeting at Glasgow had to be abandoned, owing to the hostile attitude of the crowd, and a counter Meeting was held, pledging support to the Government.
It is difficult to realise how watchful tho groat silent mass of work-ing men are, and how generally sound is their judgment.    For example,   . General Maurice&apos;s letter to the &quot;Times&quot; had for a short time a pacifist effect upon members of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers, whose stronghold is at Birmingham, but within two days came the Prime Minister&apos;s speech, which oreatod a revulsion in favour of the Government.CONVICTIONS.John McLean, the Bolshevist Consul for Glasgow, was tried at Edinburgh on the 9th May, and sentenced to five years&apos; penal servitude.     Ten days have&apos; elapsed and no Meetings of protest have been held, though there is a good deal of feeling below the surface.    McLean, who appears to be not &apos;quite stable in his mind, has announoed that he intends to begin a hunger strike. &apos; ,Richard Clinton Wood and Thomas Turner were summoned for printing a leaflet for circulation in Messrs. Adam &amp; Gramilda&apos;s Aeroplane Works, Vauxhall, pledging the persons signing it to resist the Man Power Bill, Wood was fined  50 and 10 guineas costs, and Turner,  25.     There is a talk of applying for a case to be stated.Mrs. Bouvier, an alien, who has been prohibited from addressing public meetings, is announoed to speak on &quot;The Present Outlook&quot;.     This will be watohed.INTERFERENCE YflTH INVESTMENT IN THE WAR LOAN.Tho Pacifists appear to be engaging in a form of propaganda whioh is very difficult to detect.    A few days ago, a correspondent received inside the wrapper of the &quot;Weekly Herald&quot;, the following anonymous letter&quot;DearYou are a man of intelligence and perspicacity, and like to be well informed.     I thought that perhaps you would like to have a oopy of a paper with a few details of what we are fighting for, and for what you are subscribing to the War Loan for.     Of course, you have a per ect right to put your money whero you like, and no one will quarrel with you for putting it in War Loan Stook. in fact many will approve, but for heavenTs sake do not be so dogmatic and think that only you know anything about the Government and its doings.     In your professional oapaoity, you occasionally deal with people who -know more than you are,,ever likely to know,Hand I y/ould suggest,,that you do not follow the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Sketch&quot; and *Mlrrer&quot; so closely, but try other papers in addition, and use your own judgment, and occasionally when there is anything important on, get the official publications, and you will be surprised .Yours, etc.Well wisher&quot;.THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY.    .Mr. Tom Mann has been&apos;addressing the City of London Branch of the Independent Labour Party on the subject of &quot;Revolution after the War&quot;. Only 150 people attended, and there was but little enthusiasm, in spite of the faot that a delegate had come from America on behalf of Tom Mooney and his four comrades who had been sentenoed to death in the United States. He also spoke to the 7/oolwich Branch at the Plumstead Baths on the 12th, to an audience of about 600.    The Chairman on that occasion, Mr. Jaok Newman, had much to say about the servioe done by the Bolshevist Government in publish-ing the Secret Treaties.
A NEW PACIFIST SOCIETY.&apos; James Fowler Shone, of 104, Rodenhurst Road, London, who was reoently convicted in connection with Pacifist propaganda, is trying to launch a now Society called the &quot;Peaoe Workers&apos; Fellowship&quot; or ^Friendship of Peopled League&quot;, with financial support from a Mr. Francis Griffiths and a Mr. Muggeridge.    A leaflet issued in advanoe shows that the objects of the League- are on the familiar lines, and that propaganda is to be started among Trades Unions, political, philanthropic, and other Societies.    He appears to contemplate a defiance of the Regulation requiring him to submit suoh leaf-lets to the Press Bureau.THE BOLSHEVIKS.An intercepted letter from Litvincff to a Mrs, Behman, who had appealed to him to get her husband released from the British Army, shows that he is not now interfering in this direotion.    He says that he has demanded the release of all Russians from the Army, but with no result, and he does not hope for any result from legal proceedings.    He regrets, therefore, that he is unable to help her.A certain number of Bolsheviks are ready to go baok to Russia by a boat leaving this week, but the matter has been complicated by Litvinoff nominating as Diplomatic Couriers, two of the most undesirable of them, namely, Joe Fineberg and Wintin,     It would be impossible to contemplate these men travelling backwards and forwards between Russia and this country. Fineberg is violently anti-British, and hiB influence on the Bolsheviks at Murmunsk, who at present are working fairly well with the British Naval Authorities, would be very bad.    The Foreign Office are now disoussing the matter with Litvinoff.THE FOREIGN JEWS.A Conference of the Jewish Social Democratic Party and the British Socialist Party on the &quot;Aliens&apos; Labour Restrictions&quot; was attended by delegates from practically all the Jewish Trades UnionB, and a Committee was elected.FOREIGN JEWS IN AMERICA.It now transpires that Dr. Magnus Straus, proprietor of the American &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;, and Dr. Moses S. Melamed, the Editor, who were reoently arrested, were trying to oonvey to Germany the secret formula of the chemical composition used by the Allies in their gas masks, in order that the German might invent a new gas, far which this composition would net be prophylactic Straus is also head of a German organisation oalled &quot;The Committee of the East&quot;, formed to spread pro-German propaganda among the Jews in neutral oountries.    Straus floated the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; in May, 1916, and appointed Dr. Melaaied as Editor.     Both these men woro prominent Zionists, and the journal was devoted ostensibly to that cause.     It is said that the Amerioan Polico have now discovered that the notorious Dr. Albert, of the German Embassy, paid 86,000 dollars to Dr. Straus for German propaganda in the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;.
4A circular has been issued from the Trades Hall, Dublin, to tho &quot;Organized Workers of England, Scotland and Wales&quot;, appealing to Trades Unions to,support the Irish in resisting Conscription,    The manifesto is signed by William 0&apos;Brien, Dublin, Thomas Johnson, Belfast and Michael Egan, Cork.&quot;The Sinn Fein leaders&apos;who have been arrested under Regulation 14.B, for hostile associations are being lodged in different prisons in England, in batches of twenty.THE UNION OF( DEMOOMTIO., CONTROL.One of my correspondents haB had a conversation with Mr. Langdon-Davies, of the National Counoil for Civil Liberties,    He was very full of the educational work of the Union of Democratic Control, which is now preparing the way for a strong demand for Peaoe.    He said that it is not London that will take the lead, but the country.    He complained of the difficulties put in their way by the Press, whioh was all against them? that the Press deliberately misrepresented the condition of Austria, where, though there may be discontent in the towns, food must still be plentiful in the country districts.    He said that shortage of food would never bring about Peace,   It might produce War-weariness, but not defeats    He thought that the War would last fully another two years, for the working class has lost ground in all the belligerent countries, and has well nigh^parted with all its politioal power.    He went on to say that the Independent Labour Party.was threatened with schism, owing to the mismanagement of the visit of the American delegates.    He said that there Was a growing cool-ness between Messrs. Maodonald and Snowden, the latter being always in favour of a strong and even violent action, and Macdonald acting as the drag.23rd May, 1918.
