1 i S   201SBCIOSUEE &quot;B&quot;,Hay 8, 1918.To i,;0 Jeannenoy, Presidont Inter-Allied Conference of Hay 6, 1918, (called to consider Groneral Porshingrs proposition and plan for military unification of the Allied services of suppiyRelative to tho three questions the conference proposed at its first meeting and in accordance with your suggestion that com-monts be.filed thereon, I submit the followingGeneral Pcrshingrs plan, in so far as it Involves the co-ordination of military supply, transportation and construction now located in the immediate allied rear, Is susceptible of adoption by tho military commands as distinguished from the civil as a strictly military measure of co-ordination involving activities now wholly under military control but as yet not co-ordinated between the three armies.    To this extent the plan may be considered as presented by the Commandor-in-Chicf. ,ii0iiyFo, as a measure of military action affecting the immediate rear and therefore as only necessary in this particular phase to be dis-cussed in its relation to the several existing military as distinguished from civil authorities,,The plan in its more general application, involving the co-ordination of activities now- under civil control, must be first approved by the Government of the United States as well as by England and France,   But since the first conference on this sub-ject of prime importance has developed some hesitation as to their authority on the part of members of the conference, I deem it my duty as General Pershingxs representative at this conference to place on file the following statement as applying simply to the co-ordination of tho immediate activities of the allied rear now possible under his plan if approved by the existing military authorities alone.Before nr   submission to the conference of General Pershing&apos;s plan looking to the military unification of the services of the , aii&amp;ed rear to match the military unification at the front, he had obtained the verbal acceptance of the principle by M. Clemenceau and LIr,Lloyd George.   She duty of this conference therefore was to devise a plan, not to suggest obstacles to its consummation - to which most of its time was devoted at the first meeting.     The letter of General Pershing addressed to myself and submitted to the conference, considered together with the detailed statement of his plan, indicates that his desire is such to secure military unification of the services of supply of th&amp; allied rear that while he would prefer final authority to be located in one man he would acquiesce in an agreement by which the military authority of the proposed committee could be set in motion only by the unanimous consent of its three members.This
^        MThis suggestion should of itself sweep away the objections raised, at this conference to this procedure. General Pershingrs contention is that if British and American lives can be trusted to French control so can British and American material.   This military central control o,f supply service is as essential to maximum effectiveness of effort against the enemy as unified military control of the front.   The recent reverses during the first days of the last offensive were sufficient to sweep away the arguments against allied military unification suggested by national pride and prestige for the last four years,&quot; With the difficult months ahead of us, and the urgency of unity of action and mutual co-operation, minor considerations should not now be raised against a plan involving a principle so indisputably cor-rect that it is immediately adopted upon presentation by those first in authority and committed to us to work out and not to combataGiven a military control committee of three, ond each rep-resenting the British, French and American armies, with authority through military channels to collect full information and then with power to put into effect by military order a unanimous deci-sion improving tho co-ordination of the rear, what harm would ire-suit ?     If it did nothing else this military committee, would be a clearing house of information, thus facilitating the now clumsy efforts born of overwhelming necessity, to co-ordinate the activi-ties of the allied rear.   Each Government retaining its control&apos; over its member   could, through his veto power, save from any pos-sible alteration its entire system of intermingled civil and military control so jealously exploited in the discussions of this conference,,   So vast are the possible accomplishments of good from the military unification of tho allied services of supply, under one man or military committee,&apos; extending throughout England, France, Italy and the United States, properly to be regarded as the &quot;rear5- in this effort, that we are instinctively prone to dwell constantly on the impossibility of obtaining it, overlooking the possibilities of obtaining most important advantages in&apos;the -immediate rear of the armies without necessarily cutting any governmental system of internal rod tape and using only existing military authority.As charged by General lershing with the duty of making rocom-mendations to him looking toward the co-ordination with our allies of the array activities of the American rear, if this, military committee is formed and even if contrary to his advice its raili-tary authority could not be set in motion except by unanimous consent, I would ask and expect from it unanimous action resulting in the transmission of the necessary orders as follows(1).   Ordering information from the departments concerned of tho three armies as to the status of the present warehouse capacity of the three armies in France, and if it is found sufficient to providofor the present and future requirements of the al-lied armies considered as one,&quot; an order to the American Army not to waste tonnage, material, work and men in building new warehouses where sufficient empty warehouse space exists.
(2),   Ordering information from the concerned depart-ments of the three armies as to the total present un-loading capacity of the docks of France (including transportation from tho docks to tho front of the un-ified allied array) and the amount of material now be-ing transported to the front from these docks so that it may be intelligently determined whether tho American Army is building unnecessary docks and thus diverting material, tonnage, work and men from more important service,(3),   Information ordered from the three concerned departments of the total amount of civilian and mili-tarized labour now at the disposal of the three armies so that if it were ascertained that the present supply, if used in proper co-ordination is sufficient, orders be issued for its proper use and for the A.h.i\ to cease the continued importation of civilian labour from adjoining countries, thus.putting a further tax upon the local resources of France,(4)v   Ordering information from the concerned depart-intents of the throe armies as to the present status of motor transports in France and upon the development of the situation the issuance of immediate orders provent-ing any one army from consuming shipping space by bring-ing camions to franco when sufficient are available or can be manufactured here for the unified army at tho front,(5).   Information with appropriate orders as to whether central distributing depots for the joint use of the three armies do not now exist to that extent which will render possible an intelligent reduction of American construction projects in this connection,,(6),   Information with appropriate orders as to the &apos;  collective situation of freight cars and locomotives, the use to which they are being put at present, whether economical to that effect as would render it impossiblo for us to cut down requisitions of this nature from America,(7),   Obtaining information regarding normal supplies common to the three armies with a view to their equitable distribution as needed, in or-der to present unnecessary use of tonnage,, to ac-cumulate unusual quantities during tho present crisis.in shipping,(8),   And many more subjects of&apos;importance -the above being only a few important illustrations.That the members of this conference instead of devoting themselves to a discussion of the methods necessary to carry out a plan accepted in principle by the Prime liinisters of England and franco and proposed by the Oo;xaander-in^di:.iof,..A.E.J?. ,; confined themselves chiefly to the suggestion of the obvious difficultiesin
in tho \/ay of a complete international application of the idea,  -resulted in this first conference in a comparative lack of dis-cussion of cortain practicable stops of greatest importance re-la-tod to the imcdlato roar of tho armies.   General Pcrshing has made this proportion in no sbw ,w.t of distrust.   It must be real-isod however th&amp;c if as suggosvod at this conference tho partial pooling of supplies and rosoarx-os now going on under tho pressure of necessity is continued through subordinate or separate controls as dintinguished from a military central control, that an insuper-ablc obstacle is raised to a fair and complete solution of the problem.   This insuperable obstacle to complete perception of the necessities of a common situation and the application of the no-cossary remedies in connection with it lies&apos; in&quot;tho fidelity of the subordinate in charge of a particular supply to tho unit which ho supplies,   T:ic conception of such a subordinate of a com-mon necessity is determined primarily, by its effect upon tho need with Uiose satisfaction ho is charged as a matter&apos; of military duty.Vliile the disposition socms to exist to combat the logical ox-tension of tho idea of authority in this time of emergency and war to a military dictatorship of the entire allied service of supply, as suggested by General Pursuing, it is well to point out that if that idea was accepted by the throe Governments the central authori-ty being charged with the responsibility for the whole would con-coivo and carry out these responsibilities in terms of the whole, and not in terms of throe separate armies.&apos;  Is it possible that France,. England and tho United btatos will trust under French command their men and hesitate at trusting their material ? This question must not bo discussed except upon the assumption that if the central con-trol is established it will bo impartially administered, Objections to it must be upon the ground/ alone of the impossibility of creating the machinery,.. If I have wrongly interpreted tho conservatism in this confor-once it is not because of any lack of appreciation of the spirit of co-operation, as evidenced by the treatment which tho Americans have received from services of supply in Franceu Generosity and quick response to our suggestion of any neccs-sity have over marked tho attitude of our allies.   All freely boring to the common cause the limit of resources in wealth and precious lives.,   The people from the highest to the lowest are one in complete soIf-sacrifices   The question therefore is only one of natural steadfastness and conservatism,   But. this conservatism and steadfastness should not now be allowed to intorfero with the consummation of the common victory0 General Porshing has placed his authority over his military service of supply rvt the disposal of the allies for its proper co-ordination and to insure the maximum, effort against the enemy. This action on his part is the highest expression of his confi-denco in the justice and fairness of our allies&apos;and is the best indication of his belief that the plan which he has proposed, notwithstanding all the arguments raised at this conference against it.  is possible of accomplishment if it is mot.in a similar spirit.In conclusion let me say that the matters to which I am calling specific attention and which demand co-ordination, are mat-tcrs affecting the immediate military rear of the armies, Thoauthority
M*       0        M*authority to create tho military central control^ absolutely nooos-sary to deal with thorn effectively0 exists or can be made to exist in this conference by tho delegation of existing military author-ity alone.   As military men we have no right to screen our rospon-sibilities for a bad situation as regards co-ordination in the In-mediate rear of the armies by raising smoke about civil intorfer-onee and extending unduly the scopo of the discussion of a coinpro-hensive and unquestioned principle0   It Is our fault and our fault alone if wo do not correct the situation. Civil governments have delegated us both duty and a full authority with which to accom-plish it,, Concessions of independent military authority must be made to a central controlc   The American Commandor-in-Chicf in. his plan places his at the disposal of the allies, The present lack of military co-ordination of the allied services of supply of tho immediate rear of the armies prevents the maximum use of our military rosources against a thoroughly consolidated enemy.&apos;If as military men we fail to correct this we are responsible in blood and lives and possibly defeat - and we alone,(Signed);0 CHARLES Gc DAWES,,Colonel, Lngineers, N.A0
