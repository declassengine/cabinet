(This Document jfiJ!^,,.g,rQperty of His Britannia M ,\       &apos; Ci )v vnmentj ,&apos;V w n^i1 would submit to the War Cabinet the following considerations in favour of * scheme for increasing the existing issue of newsprint to the -Daily Mid Weekly nowspapare of the United Kingdom under the supervision of the Ministry of Information.The importation of additional pulp has to compete for tonnage space with other demands,    newspapers, however, are not to this generation $ luxury but a necessity, without which the modern state cannot properly govern itself or direot its full energies to the war.       fiie mind misses news and comment o.uite as much as the body misses food, mi lack of p?o$ev nmm produces a morbid and unhealthy state of mind inimi cal to the fighting spirit.    Sim extraordinary rumours which gain currency nowadays about great battles which never took place or about British generals executed in the Tower are the direct result of the restriction of the free supply of news inevitable in war time.    In peace time stories as wild as these would never be believed, because everyonewould knew-at onm that if truethey would be $tteUabed-in the $ally Press.    Restrictions of news, therefore, even when unavoidable for military reasons, tends to produce panic and suspicion, and is in itself a bad thing for a combatant State.    The complete suppression of newspapers would take us straight back,to mediaeval rumour.    On the ether hand, the more news and comment, the more the public will be Have that their rulers arc not concealing the truth from them, and their morale will be proportionately strengthened.    For instance, it would be a serious matter if lack of space compelled the newspapers to omit the long daily reports of theircorrespondents at CH,$*, for a crop of alarmist rumours would
take the place of first-hand accounts, which are true and yet supervised by the authorities.    The greater the publicity, subject to the cencorship, the firmer tho public mind.I would submit: (l) that if it is in any way practicable the supply of new:print should be increased   (2) that in return for this advantage the newspapers would be willing to accept some conditions as to the use of this additional supply in giving additional War news, and news useful for the public interest.The Minister of Information has his attention drawn hourly in the directing of propaganda to foreign, neutral, or enemy countries to the fact that what influences opinion abroad most of all ic accurate and interesting news of the progress of the far on land and sea, and the effect and determination of the Nation at home to ensure victory.There is widespread ignorance in ^foreign countries of tlfie work of the British Empire, and that ignorance is exploited by German propaganda.By suggestion is that the Ministry of Information should be the source of any control (1) because it is responsible to Parliament; (2) because it is concerned with the maintenance of national morale as viewed impartially from outside and the maintenance of this is the only object of the control; (3) because of the use of British newspapers in providing; news for all neutral, allied and (indeed) enemy countries.The scheme in outline is this;-(l) That the existing arrangements for paper control should not be interfered with in any way.(2) That the Controller of Shipping, Coal, and Railways, and the Minister of national Service, should make the necessary arrangements to permit the importation of an additional quantity of pulp for newspapers only into this country and to permit of its manufacture by the existing rationed, firms of manufacturers,
(3)   That this additional supply-of paper should he die-tribute el to the daily and weekly Sunday newspapers pro rata of their .pTre,B,eM oiroulation * the object of the extra supply being to secure as much publicity as possible for the material used, which can only be done in this way. (4)   This distribution would only be made if the Minister of information, or whoever was acting for him was satisfied that the additional spaoe made possible was &quot;being used for the provision of v/ar news.The reason for this stipulation is that it would be impossible for the Government to strain their transport accommodation further in order that newspaper firms might make use of the extra paper for advertisements.    The Minister of Information would in no way attempt to control the nature of the news given by this additional paper minply.    All that would be stipulated would be that the additional supply of paper which would be distributed pro , rata amongst all the newspapers of this class, should he devoted to supplying War news of such a kind as each paper would select suitable to its readers and not to advertisements or to general newspaper matter.The scheme may be summed up briefly as a War measure producing more news and less rumours, greater stability and contentment and less liability to panic, and at the same time giving an opportunity equally to all newspapers to supply that news of the War which is impeded at present by the limitation of supply.Beaverbrook.Ministry of Information. May 15th 1918.
