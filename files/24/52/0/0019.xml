i\UlTh^Docurnent Is the Property, tiL &apos; 4 7 Jis Britannic Wia]3sLy&apos;a Government-1-MAINTENANCE OF THE ARMY IN PRANCE.iVIEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE.I have---read the Army Council&apos;s Memorandum No. G.T.4598. I venture to suggest that this presentation of the Army Council!s case Is in places so difficult to follow that the strength of the Army&apos;s claim to the services of a larger proportion of the availa-ble men of the country is obscured by it.PART 1..Several points raised in the Memorandum appear to require to be noted.1.     In the Memorandum there are various indications that the Army Council believes that the Ministry of National Service has prevented the Army receiving the men it required, because the Ministry of National Service underestimated in December 1917 the probable wastage In France in 1918.   It is true that the wastage in France to date has exceeded the estimates of the Ministry of National Service, but as the ftar Office expectation of recruits   required to maintain an adequate flow of drafts to France was slightly smaller than that of the Ministry of National Service, there does not appear on this point to be any reasonable ground for the attitude adopted by the Army Council.   It Hll, I think, be common ground that It tvas by the ivish of the to Office that in December 1917 the requirements for France and for other theatres in 1918 were treated as separate problems.   In the Memorandum of General Smuts Inquiries on the Figures for Man Poorer (M.P.C30) Table 1 the deficit (all arms) at 31st December 1918 was estimated by the Ministry of National Service at 210,139; by the War Office at 277,178, after allowance had been made by the Ministry of National Service for 120,000 British drafts to be required for theatres other than France: by the iVar Office for 192,000 British drafts to be required for theatres other than France.   Deducting the estimated drafts for other theatres fr*?m the estimated deficiencies the Ministry of National Service estimate of deficiency in the manning of the drafting, machinery and in France was 90,139, the ^ar Office estimate was 85,178.It is true that in the Ministry of National Service estimate a provision for the drafting machine is expressly included and that 4t is not expressly included in the War Office figures.   As however the figures *jere worked out to determine a basis for recruitment for 1918, it is unlikely that the need of drafts for the early months of 1919 was overlooked or deliberately excluded by the IVar Office.It is perhaps worth noting that the British drafts required for theatres other than France appear at present unlikely to ex-ceed the Ministry of National Service estimate of 120,000.
48   IIt should he remembered, however, that the basis of the Ministry of National Service calculations was so far as France is concerned definitely expressed to be the rate of wastage experienced in 1917 applied to the strengths of 1918 and not a prophecy of&apos;what would happen in 1918.2.        In Part II of the War Office Memorandum, paragraph 22, it is stated that the representative of the Minister of National Service before the Smuts Committee contended that, a3 the British Army would be on the defensive, the percentage of wastage for casualties would be considerably less than during the period when the British Army was on the offensive.   There is no official record of any such contention having been put forward.   Nor in Lord Derby&apos;s Memorandum (M.P.C.29) of 14th January, 1918 is any such contention referred to.   In view of the fact that the calculations upon which the Ministry of National Service worked throughout -.:ere based oh an application of the casualty rates of 1917 to&quot;the strengths of 1918, no such contention could have arisen.   In fact so far from advocating any such hypothesis, the covering note prepared for Genera]. Smut si! Committee expressly stated that the Table based on the French ratio, which was prepared at the request of General Smuts:! Committee, was :,only put forward for the sake of comparison and not as a likely forecast of the position during 1918, being based on the very low Franch ratio of nett wastage to combatant strength (25$) shewn in Table H of !,var Cabinet Report G 185&quot;.   This table has never been used by me or by any of my staff as a practical working basis.3*        A further miscalculation on the part of the Ministry of National Service is alleged to exist ./ith regard to the numbers of recovered sick and mounded to be returned from England to an Expeditionary Force.   It is stated in the Army Council Memorandum, paragraph 22, that the Adjutant General&apos;s estimate ,/as 16,500 a month and that this has proved to be an overestimate of about 1000.   The Ministry of National Service estimate for April was 14,877; for May 11,179; for June 14,877; &apos; further that&quot; the total for the year would be 252,677 All Arms&apos;if heavy fighting began in February, and&apos;that the total would be 216,463 if heavy fighting did not begin till May.     It will I think be safer to wait to the end of the year before deciding which estimate .vas the less inaccurate,
I do not propose to follow the Army Council&apos;s calculations of deficits in detail.     It is sufficient to note that they take account of deficits only and ignore surpluses and men allocated to the formation of new units.The broad fact of the Military Man-rower position is that the strength of the British Army (excluding Colonial, Indian and all other Forces raised Overseas) has increased steadily since the out-break of War,     l?or present purpose it is sufficient to take the strength of the British Army at 31st December, 1916, and contrast it with that at Fist December lv&apos;17.-The figures are:-At 31/18/16 .... .... .... 511,000At 51/12/17 .... .... ----        .661,000Hett Increase in 1917 .... 350,0001918Between 1st January and 18th May,/ over one quarter of a million (263,000) men have been raised for the Armed Forces; of these the Army has received 225,150 men.The Casualties in all Theatres of War reported since 1st January 1918, to 12th Hay 1918, were as followsKilled, Died of Wounds, Died and Missing        .... 162,85ftWounded .... .... .... ; 165,858525,716The number of sick sent home from Pranceduring the same period was     .... .... ^ 100,261Total-.......,   i 425,997.Of the above figure of sick and wounded it is estimated that 157,000 will ultimately recover and become fit for some form of service, so that the approximate permanent wastage during this period may be stated at approximately 269,000.     This does not take account of the sick admitted to hospitals in theatres other than Prance.Therefore, the nett permanent loss to the Army in 1918 up to 12th May during which period it had received 209,581 recruits, exceeds the gain by approximately 60,000.Pigrures with regard to the Army alone have practically no meaning, however, except in relation to the general War effort of the Country.
The following paragraphs shew the effort which the United Kingdom has made for the maintenance of the personnel of the Forces.   It shews approximately the extent to which the men still in civil life are engaged directly in the production of war material for ourselves and our Allies,   It also shews generally the occupational distribution of the men of the old military age still in civil life.From the facts set out below it is clear that, apart from the older men of the new military age and the regular intake of A (iv) boys, any substantial reinforcements of men fit for general ser-vice can only be drawn from the following sources:-(1) Ireland.(2) Munitions.(3) Agriculture.(4) Transport Services.(5) Coal Mines.ARMY.Strength on mobilization ** 4th August, 1914, - including Regular Army, ArmyReserve, Territorial Force, etc.,       ...     ... 726,000Enlistments from 4th August, 1914, to date, together with number of recruits provided for up to 30th June, 1918.Estimated number of men of military age engaged in provid-ing for the needs of the Army at 31st January, 1918, as per attached detailed Statement . marked &quot;A&quot;, ...   ....Add:   ROYAL AIR FORCE.

The claim made by the Army Council is in effect that the Government has failed to maintain the Army.     In view of the un-questioned fact that the Army has since 1st January, 1917, in-creased its strength, this claim in the form in which it is ad-vanced is untenable,The real case,. for the Army receiving more men appears to me to be as followsThe original organisation of the British Army was not adapted to modern war.     Far too little importance was attached to Artillery, Machine Guns, Transportation, Labour; proportion-ately too much to Cavalry and Infantry.     When the new Armies were formed the model of the old was naturally followed.     As the importance of Artillery, Machine Guns, Gas, Tanks, Aeroplanes, Transportation, etc. was recognised, they were provided for by grafting new units on to the existing formations.     In the mean-time, liabilities which could only be met by formations contain-ing large numbers of infantry, and in the Eastern theatres, cavalry, were assumed.     Neither the Army Council nor the Govern-ment foresaw the vast numbers of men which the developments of the machine side of warfare would require, with the result that the Army Council is now embarrassed by the multitudinous responsi-bilities which it has assumed with full authority of the Govern-ment for so doing,In the meantime, new needs outside the purview of the Army Council have arisen, e.g,, merchant shipbuilding, ex-pansion of the Royal Navy to meet the submarine menace, food production; to take merely a few examples.     In result, the Army has not received sufficient numbers of men to enable the Army Council to effect satisfactorily the expansions required to meet its liabilities; expansions which were sanctioned by implication when successive Governments authorized or ordered the assumption of new responsibilities.Apart from this, but aggravating the difficulties, there is the undoubted fact that in the past the posting of recruits was unwisely liberal to the new. and expanding arms, with the result that the infantry reserves were starved.The position now is that battleworthy recruits can only be obtained from Ireland or at the expense of the war in-dustries.The difficulty in connection with the latter is partly obvious; partly only discoverable after close investigation. Some of the Production Departments have, in the interests of Immediate production, shown surprisingly little foresight and appreciation of their position as subordinate partners in the general war effort of the Country.     They have encouraged the producing firms to retain young fit men and have not insisted on the inclusion in the operative staffs of works of large numbers of men less fit for military service (though of full industrial value), women, and older men.     The result is that, now that the strain is coming in its full intensity the Produc-tion Departments are alarmed and some of them are even still trying to retain the young fit men permanently,
It is impossible in a paper of this type to enter into full details on every point,   I desire, therefore, to summarize my conclus-ions and If any of them are challenged, subsequently to produce the evidence on which they are based.The Army Council&apos;s claim for more men is fully justified, not on the ground that the Army has not received enough men to maintain lit -that is a frequently repeated statement v/Ithout foundation In fact r but on the ground that It hae not been expanded sufficiently to enable it to meet the military liabilities which successive Governments have from time to time assumed.This failure to secure expansion has mainly resulted from a fail-ure on the part of all concerned to recognise the inferiority of a new Army to an old army, even if the men In the new army are Individ-ually equal or superior to those in the old.This inferiority is partly the result of the impossibility of providing a new Army with staffs of the same uniform high standard of efficiency obtainable in an old army, partly to the inferiority ot extemporized officers to those with professional training and of equal capacity of brain and character.As a result of the failure to secure expansion on an adequate scale, the drafts, more especially those for infantry, have been rush-ed into the Field incompletely trained.   This has led&apos;&apos; to unnecessarily heavy casualties and has aggravated the difficulties indicated under (B) above.Ignoring (B) and (C), it has been the habit to count off British Divisions against German Divisions.   This has lead to the incurring of fresh military liabilities.In order to secure the military position it is necessary to pro-ceed at a very early date to recruit Irishmen in large numbers.In order to seoure the greatest possible yield of recruits from the remaining resources - of Great Britain it is necessary to secure; unified control over the labour policy of the Government and to end the present multiple Departmental control.   This point is more fullyIdealt with in my paper K.S.Rn38 dated the 21st May, already submittedI to the Cabinet.With all respect I Y;ould suggest that the V/ar Office Statistical j Department be reinforced.   I have tried to avoid being polemical in j this paper &quot;but I feel I must draw attention to the great difficulties (created for the Ministry of National Service by the War Office.In the Army Councils Memorandum G.T.4598, Part II, Para. 21. 1 Table A. category A recruits over 18-8/12 for April are shown asDemand 38,700; Supplied 65,989; whereas in Table B (the large liable following Para,27) category &quot;A&quot; recruits posted in April are jshown as follows:-25,000 posted to Infantry and 22,000 to other Arms, a total of ^7,000.   In each case the figures are wrong.   If 47,000 had been shown in Table A. it would have been correct though highly mislead-tag, and so far as the heading goes in Table B. the total should have teen 65,929.
As a matter of record, the recruits posted to the Army in April amounted to 78,298 out of a total enlistment for the Armed Forces of the Crown of 88,241.    Those allotted to the Army were distributed as follows:-TotaliGRADE 1.OTHER GRADES.Under 18/8    18/8 to   Over 43.i.  43!983,576: 7,513684There are other errors in the figures given in the Army Council&apos;s Memorandum but as they do not affect the general thesis that the Army is in urgent need of recruits I have not considered It necessary to specify them.
