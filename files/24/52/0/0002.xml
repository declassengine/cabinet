S E C K E T ,N.S.R. 58.LABOUR SUPPLY AND REGULATIONMemorandum by the Minister of National Service.I had not intended to trouble the Cabinet with, a further Memorandum on this subject, a.a I understood that.the whole question of the co-ordination or amalgamation of the existing Labour Supply Departments would be considered by the Cabinet on Mr. Barnes1 Memorandum C,T,4341 and Mr. Churchill&apos;a Memorandum G.T.4373, and the First Lord&apos;s Memorandum G.T.4406.     I therefore proposed to reserve any observations for that occasion.     I understand, however, that the War Cabinet has referred the question of shipyard labour to the War Priorities Committee.In these circumstances I feel it necessary to point once that it is in my opinion essential that the problem not be dealt with in any piecemeal fashion; and. that the question of the co-ordination of Labour Supply should be by the Cabinet as a single problem, I submit that this both on military and Industrial grounds.out at should wholec onsidered&apos; is&apos; necessaryThe Army is making large further demands for men,     As the Cabinet is aware, apart from the intake of A,4 boys, practically the whole of any further calls for men of the old military age, fit for general service, must be met from the war industries.     Such calls will no doubt have a serious effect on the restriction of output&apos; and this effect will be permanent, unless adequate steps are taken to get the fullest possible use out of the skilled labour that is left and to reinforce and dilute such labour as widely as possible by semi-skilled and unskilled labour, both male and female.Itcarriedis, however, generally agreed that such a policy cannot be out unless it covers the whole field of the munitionsindustries.     Apart from-the fact that the shortage of skilled labour will be so great as to compel the extension of dilution in all branches of industry, there are obvious labour difficulties in attempting to enforce dilution in a partial manner.     Any such proposal as that contained in Mr. Churchill&apos;s Memorandum G.T.4577 would be impracticable unless its application were general.The military need carries the industrial position with it, Concurrently with the withdrawal of further men for the Army there will be an insistent demand for labour from the most important of the industries directly connected with war effort, - The construction and repair of merchant shipping and of anti-submarine craft will remain of vital importance, as will also special classes of munitions and certain constructional work.     At the same time the Departments responsible for agriculture and timber will look to the Government to safeguard their labour from being drawn off to other work.   There will certainly not be enough skilled labour to go round unless the greatest possible economy is used; and this can only be effected by making such labour mobile and transferring skilled workmen where they are most needed,The effective control and distribution of labour, therefore, becomes a vital factor in the whole war effort.     It may be said that at present it is the function of the Ministry of National Service to secure this,     This is so in theory but it does not work In practice; and I am certain that we shall never get effective control and economy until a single Department is able to give effective orders as to the general distribution of labour, and to enforce its orders, where necessary, by the control of mobile
** Cj -**labour In the shape, of Viar Munitions. Volunteers, War V.fork Volun-teers,and Released Soldiers.I am convinced too that the &apos;problem, c-annot be dealt with centrally, and that the co-operation of the various, industries themselves must be secured.     It would bo not a littleuiiity ior industrial conditions and Indus-trial development .ir the industries themselves, to carry out a centralised policy of regulation without any reference to the industries cmwmired/ Any such attempt would I submit be impolitic.     It would also probably break down in practice.It is not my purpose in this memorandum to elaborate a com-plete.scheme,     My object at the moment Is rather to urge the necessity of dealing with the problem as a whole, and dealing with it at once.     Details of co-ordination might well be worked out by a committee presided over by a member of the VIar Cabinet,     If as I believe complete amalgamation of the labour controlling Depart-ments is at the present time impracticable, I suggest that the principal labour using departments should be represented on a central board, the Chairman of which should be attached to the Ministry of National Service as a member of its Council, and en-titled, if. it Is thought desirable, to have direct and independent access to the War Cabinet.     This central board should absorb part at any rate of the staffs of the existing Labour Supply Depart-ments, and should have control of all mobile labour.   &apos; Its work should be decentralised throughout the country; and %h&amp; staffs of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions Labour Supply Depart-ments in the different districts should come under the direction of this central board,I also conceive it to be desirable that the work of the board in the various districts should be carried out as much as possible in collaboration with district committees of employers and employed, either jointly or severally,     The objection will probably be raised that if you work through the employers nothing gets done.     The answer I think is that the Government so far have spoken with many voices.     One Department has said &quot;Release men&quot;. Another Department has said !&apos;Keep men on guns&quot;.     Another Depart-ment has said &quot;Transfer men from guns to some other munition&quot;.      &quot; The position has never been put to employers or to the men that a given industry had definitely got to release a given number of men in a given time; that after that time the industry will get either no reinforcement of labour or a given limited reinforcement; and that the industry has to ration itself on that basis.     If this is to be done the Government must speak with one voice; and so far as officials are necessary, there should only be one set of officials,I have avoided going into elaborate questions of detail, as such a step Is unnecessary unless the general principle is approved But I wish to urge as forcibly as I can that unless the Government establishes a real and effective control of Labour Supply either the Army will not get men, or it will get them at the price of a serious loss in the output of munitions &apos;of war.21.5.18.
