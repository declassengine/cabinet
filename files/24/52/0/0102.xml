The following memorandum is compiled in order to layb e f o ro t ho 17 .f - r C r.b i no t: -fa) A Summary of the preparations which are being made to prepare an American Army available for operations in 1919,fb) Certain suggestions to be ma.de r.t the forthcoming Supremo V/ar Council meeting on the subject.SMKAJRY 0? ^M^iHONS..2, At the beginning of Apiil 1916 there was one corps(5   divisions) in France, with r total ration strength of 320,000, practically all oi which was under General Pershing&apos;s command.3. Early in Juno there will be three corps (18 divisions)in Frrnfl3 with an approximate strength of 670,000 ,   Of this number 5 divisions are in Line. 1 is a Depot division, 2 are in training under General Pershing, rnd of the remaining 10, the infantry, machine guns, engineer and signal units will be :nattached to the British for final training and temporary service and the Artillery and Trains will be under instruction in the American Area.   Details of the training of these 10 divisions is contained in Memorandum I.The shipping of these 10 divisions in April and May has.had to be rushed and not only have troops arrived at Bordeaux, Brest, Havre and Calais, but one regiment has been spread over several ships, part arriving in rngland and part going direct to France.   This has entailed some delay effcer troops actually arrive in Europe before they oan be concentrated for training.4. The Shipping programme already arranged for Juneprovides for the shipment of a frnirth oorps (6 divisions), the infantry etc. having preference and as much of the artillery aad Trains being carried as possible.5. The July and future programme is to be settled afterinformation has been received at Washington from General Pershing early in June,6. The American organization of an Army is 5 oorpsf30 divisions) with a total personnel of approximately 1,250,000,7. In deciding programme for July onwards, there aretherefore two alternatives before the American authorities:-fa)   If so requested by the Allied Commander-in-Chief, to continue giving preference to infantry etc.(b)
(h) To build up its first army by shipment of fe more divisions (including 100,000 infantry) and necessary   I ether services, 440,000 in all.8. With regard to (a) following points ere to be noted:-(i) Infantry available.   In July there will be in Amerioa IS divisions plus 24 infantry regiments, or a total infantry and machine gun personnel of about 432,000.   I(ii) State of Training.   All these will have 3 months&apos; service and. about half will have 5 months.   General Pershing has laid down that no infantry of less than I 5 months&apos; service should be sent to Prance,   This has 1 not been kept to lately, but adherence in the future  I would mean that after shipment of (say) 6 divisions in July irv,more trained infantry would be available ^ntil September.   Further preferential shipment of infantry would entail countermanding the training standard laid down by General Pershing.(ill)Further Draftb. The policy followed in Washington is That whatever the size of the army in France, 12 divisions are to be maintained in America.   Therefore If preference is to be given to infantry in July. August or September (above the 100,000 available) it must be settled at once in order that necessary numbers may be celled up to maintain the strength in United States.Equipment. The 10 divisions already attached to the British Army touches the present limit of our ability to equip completely (including transport, vehicles and horses).   The French ability in this respect is unknown, but no divisions have yet been assigned to them for equipment.   The disposal of the 6 divisions t* be transported in June has yet to I be decided by General Fershing, but sufficient transport should accompany any further units aooepted by us.9. With regard to (b) above, the question of building up acomplete American Army under their own control is almost entirely a question of maintenance of supply.   As a result cf anxiety on this point Secretary Baker is reported \p have expressed the unofficial opinion that only two divisions ^ould be shipped in eacft I ff the months ef July and August.   Otherwise the force overseas wo?ild bo growing faster than their power to feed and supply it. This difficulty oan apparently only be mot by a re-distribution of   , tonnage,I10. Apart from this question of ability of the ijnericans *omaintain from choir own resources all their troops in Trance, and apart from tacuieai considerations, the re-constitution ^f the units serving with the British Expeditionary Force inlo complete American divisions depends on the progress in training and equipment of the American artillery.   It is understood that the artillery of the first pi these divisions cannot ue ready before July at the earliest.SUGGESTIONS
(g)   The question of re-lining of guns and repair to gun carriages and other equipment (including anti-aircraft equipment)requires adequate provision12, The really important point for decision is whether thefirst American Army of thirty divisions should now bo completed.ThisSUGGESTIONS FOB SUPJCKB WAS COUNCIL. -11. (a) It is imperative that the American authorities beInformed that any further divisions coining to the British should bring their own Transport.ITe have reached our limit in equipping 10 Divisions.The requirementb are 1st Line Transport complete including horses, lorries, travelling kitchens, water carts, and bicycles.It is understood that the six divisions leaving America In June will ooe&amp;e without the above unless arrangements are made at once.These six divisions have not been allotted &quot;by General Pershing yet, and we do not know if it is the intention to allot them to the British,(b) In addition to transport and transport personnel, it is suggested that mere military personnel should now be sent, together with tank personnel for training.If offensive tperatians are undertaken next year as it is hoped, an extensive use will undoubtedly be made of tanks and it is desirable tc get a considerable number of American tank personnel trained.Similarly with artillery.   The proposed American Army cannot function as such without its Artillery being complete.Some additional Railway Construction personnel should also be sent.(c) The question of whether we could not assist by the provision of more Commanders and Staff Officers with experience in the field to expedite the training, administration and organization of American troops in the field should be considered.(d) That steps be taken to improve the methods 61 despatoh and reception of American troops.   Delay has been caused by parts of units being en different ships, some landing in France and some in England,(e) It is reported that the kits being brought over by officers and men are still excessive, -  These occupy much spaoe and should be reduced to active servioe proportions.(f) We shall fulfil Our equipment programme to the Americans, in fact we have offered recently to do more, but the assistance in provision of guns, stores, mechanical transport, etc, all means that men are required in our shops which wight otherwise be in our fighting line,
This oc.ii be done by repeating the Juno programme in July, i.e. by bringing over six divisions - nicking a total of .30, and the neoessarjr rearward services, including eviction services&apos;- a total of some 280,000 rearward, services.   This would mean that by the middle or end of August one American Amy could be complete and self-supported.If this is not done then we shall have to oontinue to assist in feeding and maintaining the American troops in France,I thinic the completion of the First American Army is the best programme to adopt.tfe should then start getting over the infantry for the Second Amerioan Army about 1st September, and these would then have had five months&apos; training in America.The other alternative is not to bring the rearward servioes of the First Army but to oontinue to bring over more infantry and machine gunners.This means that those following the original 30 divisions will not have had five months1 training!In either case the Americans want an early decision as if the latter alternative is adopted they will have to call out more men in America at on**e,29th Kay, 1918.WIL501T,
