Colonel I. Dally Jones.   /   ,gH^jB wi&amp;wm&apos;^ pi ros miwwm oi&quot; m&amp; mm,Mm Eywtlg ftovw^w -85SgOEgD * &apos; - to 0A3IIW.G.T.46 C. &apos; - IRHLAIIP.(Note by Mr. AustCn Chamberlain) .I am a littlo disturbed &quot;by some of tho obiter dicta lot fall during our recent discussions on Irish affairs. It seems to me important that wo should bo quite oiLear what our policy is and that nothing should be staid which will cause doubt as to our determination to carry it through.   I do not think that the Government either can or ought to survive the defeat of its policy on so important a matter, but unless we are perfectly clear in our own minds and vifj-ood among ,ourselves we have no chance of success.     I venture therefore to summarise tho situation as I see it.After the failure of the Convention and at the moment of introducing a new Militt^. /Service Act for Great Britain, the War Cabinet decided - wisely or unwisely is&apos; not now the question - to extend conscription to Ireland and to introduce and do their best to carry a Home Rule Bill.     At the same time they stated that though the two measures were inclepend-ent, the Order itt Council applying   conscription would not he issued till the Home Rule Bill was introduced.Since that decision was announced the situation has undoubtedly changed for the worse.    A very violent agitation has been conducted against conscription and the whole weight of the Roman Catholic Church has been thrcran into the scales against us.    At the same time information, previously in the hands of the late Irish Administration but unknown to thej War Cabinet, has been given to us showing the existence of an extensive conspiracy with German affiliations for a fresh; rising in close connection with the present German offensive in France.It is clear that the altered situation required a corresponding modification of our methods and a postponement
of any steps to enforce conscription or to introduce our Irish Bill.   The first task of the Government was to deal firmly with this conspiracy to make another rebellion impossible, to restore the authority of the law and to give to loyal, if angry and violent, men an opportunity of dissociating them-v selves from the agents and tools of a foreign conspiracy. The first steps to this end have already been taken with great skill and success by the new Irish Administration.   At the same time they have announced - quite rightly, as I think,&apos; though in terms which seem to go, rather farther than the Cabinet approved - that a fresh attempt will be made to secure-recruits by voluntary methods.&quot;for all this I have nothing but approval.   There is here no abandonment of policy, no sudden and humiliating change of front, but only a wise recognition of certain new facts or facts newly brought to our knowledge and a correspond&quot; ing adaptation of means to the end in view,   &quot;What causes me anxiety is not what has been done but the suggestion which oaops up now and again that our policy has in fact been completely changed and that we do not propose at the proper time, and when the necessary preliminary step3 for restoring the authority of government have been taken, to go on either with the enforcement of conscription or with the Home Rule  . Bill.I think any hesitation on this point would be fatal to the credit and authority of the Cabinet, would lay us open to charges of cowardice from one section of Irish opinion and of bad faith from the other, and of levity and inconsequence from everybody.   As I have said, I do not think we should survive and I do not think we should deserve to do so.:I am ready to allow whatever time is necessary in
^?mwo-&apos;.fortW px^eOLiiridmry&apos;stops,, but I hold that the Cabinet having doliberately adopted, the policy of conscription in Ireland and the  inn Feiners and nationalists&quot; having as deliberately challenged their right and the right of the Imperial Parliament to do so, the Oovernraerit Is bound to put their policy through,    &quot;Tho Cabinet was not obliged to raise.  the question (though they would have been faced with great difficulties if their decision had been other than it was) &apos;&apos; but first to raise the question as a vital war necessity and then to drop it in face of a denial of the right of the Imperial Parliament to legislate for Ireland on this question -would be to concede something which up till now the Irish Nationalists have never claimed, and which overy Liberal advocate of iiome ,iule has specifically denied.   It would be the triumph of pure separatism, the final overthrow of the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament, and, ;;s such, a thing so grave that we have in my opinion no right to contemplate it as a step under any curcumstances open to us.     Unless, therefore, voluntary recruiting secures such an unexpected, mebsure of success as practically &quot;go exhaust the potential-ities of Ireland as a recruiting field, I hold that we are bound to persevere.     If we are defeated, we are relieved of responsibility.   But if we surrender, we have not only destroyed our ov;n authority and credit but we have made it impossible for any other Government however formed to main-tain the riaht which we have first asserted and then aban-doned.     If we had not raised the question, it would have been possible for others to deal with It on its merits, but if, having raised it-, we yield to&apos; threats of violence., we Bbr.ll he ve Irretrievably injured the relations between the kingdoms for all time and shall have destroyed the last hope of effecting any settlement of our perennial Irish difficul-(Initialled)     A.C. 3rd May, 1918.
