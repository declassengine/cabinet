N E TC UliilMARy   QF   BLOCKADE    INTOHMATIOl^. 17th - a3rd ;,lay. 1916,RUSSIA,       By a Decree published on April 20th the Russian Government declared that henceforth only registered securities will he valid in Russia,     All IHussian and foreign shares or other interest-bearing paper, whether belonging to Russian citizens or foreigners in Russia, must be immediately presented for registration at one of the branches of the Peoples1 State Bank.   All banks in Russia holding securities must register them at the Peoples&apos; Bank in the names of the persons for whose account they are deposited.   Special legislation will be introduced for licensing transactions in registered securities, and compensation will be paid to the owners of shares in enterprises which have been nationalised.   Arrangements will be made for resum-ing the payment of dividends on registered securities.NORWAY.        We noted last week that pending the revisions rendered ne-essary by the new Agreement between Norway and the United States 11 .M, Government are willing to regard our old agreements with the Norwegian Associations as operative and to arrange facilities for the import into Norway of goods controlled by the Associations. The United States War Trade Board have sincedeclded to invite the Norwegian Associations to regard the United States Government as a party to this arrangement pending the conclusion of new agreements with the Associations.   Tne Allied Blockade Committee consider that these new agreements should be negotiated in London rather than Christiania.   In Christiania the delegates of the Associations are open to the pressure of powerful Norwegian interests which hope to see the control of imports into Norway transferred as far as possible from the Associations to the Norwegian Government.SWEDEN The Germans have agreed as from May 15th to issue safecon.!dufets for Swedish vessels trading between Swedish and Neutral bar-
-a-bours on the North Sea and tho Baltic   These safe conducts may toe obtained from the German Naval Attache at Stockholm or the German. Consul General at Gothenburg.   They will secure vessels from being taken into German ports for examination.   Safe oonduots will not be granted to vessels entering the danger zone or   jonvoyed by Allied warships.3 4 MMAHK. The Danes have arranged to send during 1918 20,000 tons of   .3 -cereals to Norway, 15,000 tons of cereals to Sweden, and two cargoes of wheat to Finland.    In view of these lavish exports the Danish Government can hardly maintain that there is any necessity for import-ing further supplies from.overseas.   We are drawing the attention of the United States Government to the matter.The Allied Blocicade Committee have decided to extend to Denmark the relaxation of the general embargo on exports from the United King-dotn to the Northern Neutrals already allowed in favour of Sweden and Holland.8 fi NBTHERLAJDS.   On requisitioning the Butch ships in British Ports we assured the Dutch Government that we should requisition no ships ar-riving from Dutch waters after March  let.   The Dutch Government are &apos; now pressing for an extension of this guarantee to cover all ships which were on the high seas or in neutral ports on that date.   We are willing to renew our assurance in the form desired by the Dutch Gov-ernment and to guarantee that no further Dutch vessels will be requi-sitioned by ILM. Government in any part of the world provided the Dutch Government ina&amp;e immediate arrangements for resuming the Dutch East Indian trade.   Sailings from the Dutch East Indies are at pre-sent suspended owing to a dispute.which has arisen over 13 vessels formerly engaged in the Dutch East Indian trade but requisitioned by H.M. Government under tho recent order.   The Dutch contend that our requisitioning of these vessels is contrary to an Agreement lately made between the owners of the vessels and the Government of India.
Tho Government of India do not admit the Dutch contention and we are not prepared to surrender these vessels.     &apos;.Ve are asking the Dutch Government to drop their claim to these vessels and to guarantee that no Dutch ships in Dutch colonial trade will henceforth he laid up or withdrawn from service.The Dutch Government recently pressed the United States Govern-ment for an unqualified assurance that no Dutch ships will henceforth bo requisitioned in United States ports. The United States Govern-ment have replied that their recent guarantee to this effect will bo faithfully observed, but that its strict fulfilment must necessarily depend on tho military necessities of the moment. The introduction of this proviso has greatly disturbed the Dutch Government.It is reported that Mr. Kroeller has been invited to resume his place on the Committee appointed to negotiate an economic agreement with Germany.The first German train to pass over the Limburg Railway into Bel-gium arrived in Holland on May 20th.     It is reported that six goods trains of about 60 trucks and 2 passenger trains will travel daily in both directions. HITZBRLAKD.     The Swiss Government have concluded their negotiations with the German delegates at Berne and have authorised their repre-sentatives to sign an economic agreement with Germany.The Germans agree to furnish Switzerland with some 200,000 tons of coal monthly and 7,000 tons of iron and steel.     Tho price of the coal will be 173        50 centimes per ton at the pifs mouth, with a rebate of Fr.4Q per ton upon 60,000 tons monthly required for Swiss domestic consumption.     The Germans also undertake to provide Swit-zerland with 35*000 tons of chemical manures and with limited quanti-ties of petrol, zinc, sulphate of copper and drugs in return for milk products, chocolate, preserved meat and some 1 ,000/17,000 head of cattle.     The Swiss Government agree to establish over the distri-bution of commodities imported from Germany a control similar to that
now exercised by the S.S.S. over commodities imported through Allied territory.   The details of this organisation are to be settled later. ^    In the original draft of the Agreement the Germans noted that the French Government had offered to supply the Swiss with 85,000 tons of coal monthly and they agreed to waive all restrictions on the use of German coal in the Swiss factories provided the Allies fulfilled this undertaking.   They reserved the right, if the Swiss imports of Allied coal should fall below 85,000 tons, to impose further restrictions on the use of German coal in the Swiss factories, provided the German deliveries had not also fallen short in an equal degree *   The French Government based their offer of 85,000 tons upon the assumption that in no circumstances would the German impose any restrictions on theIuse of German coal beyond the ordinary control exercised at the fron-tier. They accordingly protested against the signature of the Agree-itient in its original form. Owing to their protest the Agreement will contain no reference to the French offer.1There appear to be two alternative policies open to the Allies?-(a)   The Allies might send as much coal as possible to Switzerland nd insist that the Swiss should refuse to accept any further restric-tions on the use of German coal.   The French, however, will hardly be able to furnish Switzerland with any considerable quantity of coal without further assistance from H.M.Government.   We have informed the French Government that in present circumstances it will not be possible bo increase our deliveries in France for this purpose.   We have already to send to France an additional 250,000 tons a month owing to the Ger-pn offensive\   and the Italian situation has still to be carefully considered.   Moreover, the Swiss Government cannot transport from France 85,000 tons of coal a month unless they are prepared to divert ihe whole of their rolling stock from Germany.   They will hardly take Ms step, which would probably entail the collapse of the German Swiss Agreement and an economic rupture with Germany.I   (b)   The other alternative is to supply Switzerland with the mini-
5- -   133r mm quantity of coal (20,000 tons a month) required by the Swiss fao-1 tories which work for tho Allies, thus imposing upon Germany the burden Jof supplying Switzerland with the balance.     The Germans will in this &apos; case probably insist upon a strict control of the German coal used inthe Swiss factories; . but this would not seriously interfere with theexport of munitions required by the Allies.ILRCrlMTIHE. We have hopes that the various Neutral Governments requiring cereals from the Argentine will arrange to purchase them through the, IVheat Commission acting for the Inter-Allied Chartering Executive.    The attention of the Neutrals will be drawn to the importance of our control,of the terminal, and warehouse facilities in the Argentine, of our virtual monopoly of freight and of our ability to make the necessary financial arrangements.    The Meutrals who come into the scheme will be asked to pay in their local currencies *    H.M* Treasury will thus obtain supplies of the fleutral European currencies and will in return be responsible for binding the necessary Argentine currency.    For this purpose further credits from the Argentine may ultimately be necessary.Sir R. Tower apprehends that in return for further credits the Argen-tine Government will require us to take a large proportion of the Argen-tine maize crop.     He points out that there is no immediate need to apply&quot;for these credits, as, after completing the proposed purchases for Allied countries under the present Wheat Convention, we shall still have at our disposal credits to the value of five or six millions sterling for fin-anoing purchases for neutral account.    He suggests merely notifying the&quot;Argentine Government that, in or^ler to help Argentina in disposing of&quot;her remaining wheat surplus (estimated at some 1,000,000 tons), we pro-pose to make further purchases for account of the European Neutrals.&apos;&amp;ERMAIf SUBMARINE BLOCKADE *     The following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period May 17-23, 1^16 Inclusive.
