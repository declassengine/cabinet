Vviuilul   111 i i/Cllii&apos;,,^\&quot;&apos;, Ministry   of Shipping,124&apos;V y^/-/ALL l;-    &apos;&apos; (Supplementary Memorandum)Supply of Coal for Export.r,rThe Shipping Controller wishes to supplement his memorandum of She 8th. inst. (G.T.4475) regarding the supply of coal for export and to draw the further attention of the Far Cabinet to the serious consequences which are likely   to result from the continued shortage of steam coal for export from the United Kingdom.Since the   date   of the previous   memorandum, the amount of coal available for export has continued to be seriously deficient in relation to the tonnage provided for the purpose. Although special steps had been taken to meet the extra  re-quirements for France by the allocation of a large amount of additional tonnage to that trade, the amount of coal available has barely been sufficient to keep up the total shipments even to their   ordinary level.During the three   weeks ending the 18th. May some 200,000 tons of shipping which could have loaded coed has been sent av;ay in ballast.. At the beginning   of the present week tonnage was   available for coal on the Fest and East Coasts combined to the extent of about 570,000 tons.   It is not anticipated that there trill be more than 200,000 toner of coal available during the present week.   It has therefore been necessary to send away   in ballast some 170,000 tons.   This is   of course without touching the normal coal requirements of the present week, the   moot urgent of which   are for the Navy   100,000   tons, for Prance including the French navy 425,000 tons, and for Italy 95,000 tons.   The tonnage which would have been available to convey these   quantities will either be sent away in ballast or, in the case of the smaller ships not suitable for other trades, will have to wait until coal is available./The
The continued ^hijrtag^-K)i^^^grave results,:-1. The   probability of a grave coal&apos; crisis in Trance andas a result of this   in Italy also, which may, it   is understood from the Military Authorities, have the mostserious effects on the military situation.vIt is pointed out that should   we be unable to keep up the supply of coal to France, France&apos;s first act will be to stop sending coal td Itaiy which will put us back   in the position of having to supply Italy by the long sea route,2. The disturbance of our arrangements-%ith Neutral countries the basis of whioh is the export of British coal in return for(a) tonnage which we have already received and with-&apos; out which we could not carry on the War, and(b) foodstuffs, ore, and pyrites.i3.        The dangerous docline.of bunker stocks in the Uediterr-anean and other&apos; depots, on the maintenance of which the whole movement of tonnage depends.- , &apos;V I4. The serious waste and dislocation of tonnage owing tovessels being kept waiting for cargoes or having to be diverted into trades other than those for which they were destined.&quot;pie Shipping Controller has seen the memorandumsubmitted &quot;by the President   of the Board of Trade to the r&apos;arCabinet dated the 22nd. May, which estimates the increased demandsof coal-for 1918 at some 11,000*000 tons.   He wishes to point   out,however, that in the present circumstances the   extra demand beingmade upon the- Coal Controller (which is not being met) has notattained anything like that figure nhich includes the quantityof 8,000,000 tons which we should have to supply to prance ifthe Pas de Calais mines stop altogether.The Shipping Controller is fully conscious of theurgency of the present demand for fighting men in France, Fiewishes, however, to remind the &apos;Var Cabinet of the very largenumber of troops which will be coming from the U.S.A. duringthe months of Hay, June and July.     In any case he cannottoo strongly emphasise the fact that upon our power to exportcoal depends not only the whole of   our shipping positionbut also our power of moving our Amies and those of ourAllies on the western f?&apos;cnt./it
It is of worse- the -responsibility of the CoalCprrtroJler^to--e^timaie the number of men  he requires in themines to produce the Quantity of coal necessary to carry onthe Vary and it is noted that the Coal Controllerrs recomraend-ation is that no more than 62,500 Grade 1 men should be   taken,in other -words, that 12,500 could be spared after the   first50,000 have been taken.   Before^ however, any decision isarrived at involving the withdrawal of men beyond the first50,000,the Shipping Controller wishes to dra?&apos; attention tothe following points :-(1)    The present amount of coal -available for export is quite insufficient,(2)    Tonnage is at present   available, to carry out our obligations to Allies and Neutrals but the   demands on our tonnage next winter may  perhaps make it more difficult to meet these obligations.(3)    vte are already considerably in arrears in our ship-inonts to France, which arrears we can hardly hope   to make up,(4)     Our stocks in all parts of the World show no   margin whatever.The Shipping Controller therefore wishes to call &apos; at-u^rti-on of the War Cabinet in the strongest terms to the wisdom of   providing the production of coal with some measure of elasticity which will enable it to respond to the demands made upon   it, which it has been unable to do during the past three weeks..   He submits therefore, that the recruiting of Minersbeyond the first. 50,000 should for the present be&apos;suspended, unless the responsible authorities feel thst the production of t necessary coal for export with the reduced quantity of miners is absolutely assured for the future.
