ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarinesrat- During the week under revieAV about 15 large enemy submarines have been located,two being vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type, one of which was homeward bound and the other circumstantially reported to have been at one time about 180 miles south of Nantucket. The concentration of large submarines in the western approaches to the English Channel has been very marked, no less than five having been operating there during the week; but they have not achieved very great success, having regard to the amount of traffic which has passed through that area. The present enemy tactics appear to be a concentrated patrol at the mouth of the English Channel and Irish Sea, and a systematic dogging of convoys both outward and inward.1Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and submarines. a]g0 ^e numDer 0f submarines destroyed: 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		April 27th.

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.The number of actions reported this week is again satisfactorily high, while the number of submarines operating in each of the last two weeks has been only about the average.*In addition to the two &quot; Results &quot; noted above, a U.C. boat has this week been sunk in the Mediterranean by a French armed trawler, and a U-type submarine, which had been damaged by a British seaplane, has put into Cartagena and been interned.Mediter- On 12th May seven Italian seaplanes carried out a successful attack on the submarinexanean.     base at Cattaro, and an returned safely.During the night of 12th-13th May two Italian motor boats torpedoed and sank an enemy transport which was entering the port of Durazzo, and the escorting torpedo boat is also believed to have been torpedoed.On 12th May several of our machines operating from Thasos attacked the Drama aerodrome and dropped 1,000 lbs. of bombs, causing a fire in the largest shed.On 13th May four Allied machines from Otranto carried out a bombing attack on Durazzo, with good results, three bombs being dropped on a seaplane about to rise, completely destroying it, and others being dropped on headquarters. In the afternoon of the same day six Italian seaplanes also carried out an attack on Durazzo. In each case all the machines returned safely.On 14th May at 9.40 a.m. the destroyer &quot; Phoenix,&quot; when 16 miles west of Valona Bay, was torpedoed in the engine-room. She was taken in tow by the destroyer &quot; Warrego,&quot; but at .1 p.m., owing to a very strong wind, capsized and sank at the entrance of Valona Bay.  Two men were killed.On 15th May four Allied machines attacked Durazzo, bombs being dropped on the seaplane base and barracks, and several large fires were started, including one at the seaplane base.   All the machines returned safely.

The percentage of losses to sailings in Overseas trades is this week 1 * 57 as against 1 * 05 the previous week, in Cross-Channel trades -18 as against -08, and in Coasting trades -12 as against -13, while as regards all United Kingdom trades the percentage is -71 as against - 50 last week. The considerable increase in the British tonnage lost during the week is mainly accounted for by the greater losses in the non-United Kingdom trades.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by in which enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.It will be noticed that enemy activity has this week been more marked on the Ocean routes, particularly in the Atlantic (Southern) area where three vessels were sunk about 100 miles from Scilly. There were also two losses reported in the Arctic Sea, and a vessel was unsuccessfully attacked as far west as about 400 miles east of Bermuda. The activity in the Irish Sea was very much less than for several weeks past, while in the English Channel only three attacks were made, notwithstanding the considerable number . of submarines which were operating in the western approaches to that area.The number of British and Foreign Merchant Vessels sailing in organised convoy, Vessels con-and the losses sustained whilst in convoy, during last week, compared with previous periods, voyed. are as follows :-.

During the week under review enemy minelaying has taken place in the Holyhead, Peterhead, Dover and Harwich areas. In the Harwich area the mines have on this occasion been laid considerably further from the shore than hitherto, doubtless owing to the increased obstacles which a minelaying submarine would now encounter in endeavouring to reach the War Channel in this locality.Casualties.

FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. France.A French Auxiliary Patrol Trawler sank a German submarine, believed to be U.C. 35, by gunfire off the West Coast of Sardinia on 16th May. The captain of the submarine and 30 other survivors were taken prisoners.Spain.A&apos;German submarine, reported to be U. 39, having sustained damage to her hull and machinery, entered the port of Cartagena on the evening of the 18th May and was interned by the Spanish Authorities. From reports received this submarine was, on the previous day, bombed by a British seaplane inside the Straits of Gibraltar.Austria.In the early hours of the morning of May .14th Italian motor launches penetrated into Pola harbour and fired 3 torpedoes at a ship of the &quot; Viribus Unitis &quot; type. It is said that she was sunk, but there is, as yet, no confirmation of this statement.Russia. -The Russian Government have consented to hand over to us their trawlers at Mur-mansk and in the White Sea as part payment of the Russian debt, but the negotiations for their transfer have not yet been concluded.A German submarine has been active in the Arctic Sea and has sunk some fishing vessels and destroyed the wireless station at Vaida-Guba on the Ribachi Peninsula.Admiral Kolchak, sometime Commander-in-Chief, Black Sea Fleet, is now at Harbin, and is to assist Semenov to organise movements against Nikolsk and Vladivostock.Sweden.There is a considerable outcry in the Press, especially in Gothenburg, on account of the loss of Swedish trawlers from mines laid in the Kattegat. It is considered that this minefield limits the fishing industry, and is regarded as a direct menace to the already straitened food supply in Sweden.Norway.The Norwegian Government has sent two men-of-war to Kirkenaes to prevent any encroachment by the Finns on Norwegian territory, and it is expected that a military force with the same object will also be sent to the frontier.Naval Staff,23rd May, 1918.[Appendices.MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.During the week under review eight enemy merchant ships arrived at and five sailed Merchant-from. Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.  No enemy ships have entered or left Rotter- men-dam.The reduction in the movements of enemy merchant ships, which was noted last week, has been maintained.
