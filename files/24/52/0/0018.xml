Copy of a telegram from Baron Ocfco to-the Japanese Ambassador in London*Koto of a conversation between Lord R. Cecil end the Japanese Ambassaqpr, in the xorm of a draft Telegram to Sir TV Greene,TokiO.The Japanese Ambassador called on me to-day and left with me a copy, of a- telegram- which he had received from Baron Goto,He read&apos;it to me, and I told him that the questions raised in it were so important that I could not give him a final answer without further consideration;   but, if he would allow me to expret my private opinions on the subject, for what they were worth, I should&apos;be glad&quot;to-&apos;d;o:sovv v &apos;.- - -He assented, and.I then told, him that, In my view, the situa-tion in Russia .rendered the question of intervention extremely urgent.   As far as I was concerned, I should be quite willing that Semenof should b-3   supported, if that was the wish of the Japanese military authorities.. &quot;In the same &quot;way, the Government had been anxious to make use of the Czechoslovaks now collecting at Vladivostok and we&apos;had approached the French Government on the subject. .   I recognised that these forces could be effective only if they were strongly supported by Japan, and if that happened I should be quite willing that Japan should take the direction of the whole&apos;expedition, &apos;provided of course that the Japanese made it clear that they were going into Siberia, not for the purpose of obtaining any territorial advantage, but in order to assist Russia and the Allied, cause, generally;   and provided that the Japanese were prepared, to., push their expedition as far west as Chiliabinsk, or somewhere in.that neighbourhood. ,With respectto the particular questions in the telegram that he had read to.&quot;me, I told him that Mr, Lookhart believed that joint action in Koscow with the Soviet Government would be success-ful, but that he&apos; had now arrived at the conclusion that interven-tion was so urgent that v:e ought to aet whether we obtained the the invitation of the Bolshevist Government or not,     I did not deal specifically with the second&apos; and third questions, nor did I express a definite opinion .r.s to whether wo should leave Semenof in the lurch, but I promised to&quot; consider that,The .Ambassador asked me what was the state of affairs in Washington. . &apos;.        I avoided, giving him. a direct reply, but 1 read him a passage from your;telegram Bo. 555, in which Baron Goto is &quot;reported to have said that the President showed some signs of45
reconsidering his abjections, ana I told the Ambassador that we would spare no effort to obtain American approval fdrIn tor vent ion .,I then as^ed him whether he thought that his Government with American approval woulct be prepared to intervene to the extent of sending a force to Chiiiabinsk or thereabouts for th purpose of making a diversion which might oblige the Germans to diminish their forces on the Western Front.-, ho,Ambassador professed that this way an entirely now idea, and said that his Government had so far considered only the necessity of intervening to prevent German penetration to the Pacific coast,     The proposal that they should intervene in general assistance of th^e Allied cause had not, as far as he knew, been fully considered by them.I then said that the matter was of the utmost importance that the whole course of the war might be determined by an effective intervention in Siberia;   and that I ventured to appeal to the Japanese as our Allies to do their utmost to come to our assistance,    I added that, if we knew that they w ready to Intervene on this scale, our hands would be greatly strengthened in any negotiations we might have in Washington.He again said that, from his own point of view, he would fee glad to give a favourable reply, but that he felt he could I not do so without consulting his Government, aa the matter was undoubtedly a new one to them.&apos;I did not tell him that this appeared to be inconsistent with the tenor of Baron Goto^s observations to Your Excellency-and with the various communications which have beon made to us by the Japanese General Staffo.The Ambassador left mo* saying that he would report to Government the observations 1 had made as coming from myself, I and that fee would hope to have in the course of a few days an official reply to the telegram which he had left with me, ((Initialled).

Ookl of Tale arm dated May 19th fra8L,.Barj^iflta,Jo. ..............the Japanese Ambassador inXondo.n*Sometime ago the British Government made a proposal to the Imperial Government looking to an intervention in Siberia, which they deemed necessary in order to cheek the penetration of German influence.    Subsequently, however, having regard&apos; to tho attitude of the American Government in the matter, the British Government are undereto.od to have found it advisable to induce,, if possible, the Soviet Government to invite the allied intervention, and instructed Mr.Lookhart to enter upon the negotiations with the Soviet Government on these lines.    The recent course of these negotiations is unknown to the Imperial Government, but it is preaume-d that no concrete result has yet been obtained,,    On the other hand, the British Government, fearing that the continued support on the part of the Allies to the Semenof&apos; detachment whose avowed object is to crush the Bolsheviks might hinder the progress of the negotiations above referred to, requested the Japanese Government to give also an advice to Semenof: with a view to restraining for the time being the advance of his detachment,,,    The desired advice was given to Semenof1 through a Japanese in touch with him, but it is found impossible to dissuade him from his determination.    .0n the contrary, he la continuing his advance encouraged by the success he baa so for achieved over the Bolsheviks and thanks tp the continuous enlistment of the Goesaoke in his detachment, its strength has already reached 5,000 and is growing stronger every day.    He is now menacing Kalimuakaya.Tqu-are hereby requested to seek an interview with the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs., and in calling his attention to the above circumstances, you will express to him the deep concern felt by the Imperial Government in regard to the situation thus created for them as well as for the Allies, and ask for the frank expression of his views on the following points:-(1)    la there any positive prospect of Miv&amp;ookharVs efforts in inducing the Soviet Government to invite the allied intervention being crowned with the desired success in an immediate future?($)    In the event of an invitation for the alliedintervention being extended by the.Soviet Govern-went, the immediate object aimed at by the latter would presumablyTeTthe suppression of the recal-citrant elements in the country or the defence of Russia against the German invasion.     In the opinion of the Imperial Government, it appears that in the first case, there would be no reason for the Allies to accept the invitation, while in the second case, so long as the German military operations do not extend to Siberia, the scheme- of despatching troops there as originally proposed by the British Govern-ment would not be compatible with the object as held in view by the Soviet Government,    What would ba the views of the British Government on this point?
It is true that the Soviet Government are now exercising the actual power in various parts in Russia, but they can hardly be said to represent the will of Russians in general. It is a patent fact that there exist a great many elements totally incompatible with the said Government owing to the profound animosity felt against them.     In these circumstances, it is feared that the allied intervention under-taken as the result of an understanding with tho Soviet Government, even though with the object of resisting the German&apos;agression would be liable to provoke the ill-feelings of these elements against the Allies, as having the effect of strengthening the position of the Soviet Govern-ment,     What would be the opinion of the British Government on this point?Semenof   launched forth the present enterprise in entire reliance upon the moral and material support of the British, French and Japanese Governmentsl and it is not without reason that he should be counting upon   the continuous assistance of the Allies.     If the Allies were to stop their help suddenly at the present moment and leave him in the lurch, would it not bring about the loss of their prestige in the eyes of Semenofrs   friends and give the false impression to the general populace in Russia that ,the Allies are unreliable, with the result of driving them into the arms of Germany?
