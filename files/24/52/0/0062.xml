(This Docuiin^ls^ His Britannic Maine.Ys Government.) 1 7 gJJiiDj FOR TIiE \7AR CiiBIiJBT       &quot; &quot;ask leave to record very briefly my views as to the Bill to establish a Ministry of Health.    I find myBeIf very largely in agreement with the criticisms of the President of the local Government Board.    It seems to me to be a real mistake to call the new Department &quot;The Ministry of Health&quot; when local government or the administration of home affairs must be if not its chief, at all&quot; events one of&apos;its most impor-tant duties .    I don&apos;t know whether it would be possible to adopt a compromise and call the new Department &quot;The Ministry of the Interior&quot;, but I have always thought that to be a much better and more accurate title for the local Government Beard than any other which has been suggested.I share Llr. Hayes Fisher&apos;s views as to the establish-ment of a Consultative Council, and I am not at all impressed by the reply made by the Minister of Reconstruction.    But I realise the difficulties with which the latter has been con-fronted, and I would gladly advocate a compromise in order ts achieve the result which he has in vierr, namely, the merging of the Insurance Commissioners in the one great Department. This reform must be carried out .    I know something of Consul-taijive Councils attached to Departments in other cases, and I do not envy the position of a Minister who has suddenly, to con-suit a Committee of - the kind.    I do net desire now to deal with any ether of the details of the Bill-as I have already identified myself with the views expressed by I,..r, Hayes Fisher, but I ask leave, with great respect, to say that having had many years&apos; experience&apos; of legislation, preparing Bills uc, I cannot believe that it is wise to ask a Minister who is not the Head of a D^pxi-Lmen-i^ and..thfi?BtavA has-,not the immense advantage ofthe
the counsel,advico,experionooof the groat Civil Servants connected witri the Department to help him in his task to prepare a Bill dealing with a Department of which he has nopersonal kt&apos;iowledge,v/i,th which he is in no way connected,andwhich must of necessity resent this attempt to - as it were -himoverride the Head of the Department,and ask/to accept  ameasure of which he disaooroveB;a,nd in the preparation ofwhich he.has not even &quot;been allowed to take an active part.Vie nave had. mare t*..an one illustration in recent years ofthe LU-ef%cts..v7tiich follovvii ?rom this method of legislationand I Confess 1 believe that the old plan is the better one,that-J^heKIahinet, should make up their minds that a Billis&apos;ixi.,,ba.jntrodueed for a particular purpose,should laydo^^.br-o&quot;.dJJ;aes&apos;&apos;^Lipon which that Bill is to be drawn,and-nainlythenJLe^ive it to the Head of the Department/concerned to 1 produce -the- Bill for discussion and consideration by a Committee and ultimate adoption by the Cabinet.   For these., reasons I confess I hope that the lain is try of health -Bill &quot;will net be introduced until the whole question has been further considered.My interest in these questions is the greater as I have been - as Under Secretary and President - connected with the Local Government Board fpr many years..There is tho Parliamentary aspect of tho case to which I w^uld desire also to draw attention.    There is as much work be Core parliament as can possibly fee got through if the House is to rise at any reasonable timer With a Bill of this kind - which I am satisfied would occupy an immense amount of time without being in tho ordinary-sense.-oontro-versial, it will simply moan that there will be no chance of--,, passing it,and that it will be torn to pieces in the country; the position of the Government will bo much more difficult thaif
if the Bill could be carefully prepared and then introduced and carried through Parliament.   There is already more legislation before the House of Commons than they can possibly pass in the time at their disposal, and surely it is a mistake to ask the House to consider Bills whtah we know quite well we cannot carry,28.V.18.
