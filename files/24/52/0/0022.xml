General Remarks.Employers&apos; Plans for Industrial Reconstruction in Germany.In this report for last week a sketch was given of the action which is being taken by the German Government in the direction of reconstruction of industry. This subject has also engaged the very careful consideration of the employers, and drastic steps have been taken in view of the alterations which may be expected at the close of the war.The economic policy of the Imperial Government during the war has been largely influenced by a war committee of German industries, which was constituted on the 8th August, 1914. by the amalgamation of the two great central organisa-tions of German employers, with the object of uniting in community of effort all those engaged in industrial and technical production, in order that they might apply their knowledge and skill to obtain the victory in the economic struggle. The importance of this voluntary assciation cannot be over-estimated. It placed its resources at the disposal of the State, and has undertaken throughout the war the solution of problems which in this country have fallen to the sphere of the Government. At the commencement of the war the problem of the prevention of unemployment consequent on the dislocation of industry was dealt with by that committee. It appears also to have exercised the function of the distribution of raw material and of the delivery of supplies. It, has acted as the go-between between departments of Government and the firms making delivery of goods, and in the earlier months of the war, in specially urgent cases where speed was all-important, appears itself to have undertaken provision of articles required by the army.[lino 30] B&apos; SECRET. G.T.-4629.
It is generally known that the policy of the Imperial Government has been the forcible creation of war companies, which are in effect compulsory syndications of the leading concerns in industry, the smaller concerns either being temporarily suspended or subject to fusion in the larger companies. The detail of this work, which appears to have been exceedingly difficult, and is unpopular among the com-munity generally, and specially among the smaller traders, fell to the lot of the War Committee. This measure has doubtless given an impetus to the widespread fusion, federation, and amalgamation of industrial concerns which has &quot;been a feature of the past year in Germany, and there is a strong movement on behalf A the larger industrialists to retain the system of compulsory federation during the period after the war. The policy has the approval of the War Committee, and will undoubtedly have the support of the Industrial Council, which has been recently formed, and which intends to replace the War Committee for the transition period. That Council was initiated at a public meeting which was attended by various Ministers of State, including the head of the new Imperial Economic Department. It is said to represent nine-tenths of the whole of German industry, and an agitation is on foot to ensure that the economic arrangements of the transition period are committed to its care.In so far as it is possible, from the steps already taken in Germany, to judge of the policy which has been adopted, it appears legitimate to deduce that, as far as may be, internal competition is to be eliminated or at least reduced to a minimum, and that the support of the State is expected in the competition of industry with other nations. A remarkable book on the new economic system by Herr Rathenau, a German industrial magnate, has been published, and is reviewed by the city editor of the &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; in the issue of the 20th January. In the course of that work it is decisively recommended that vocational federations should be formed, in the administration of which the State has claims to participate. It is anticipated that these vocational federations should have the right to accept or reject intending new members, that they should Have the monopoly of the sale of imported goods and the power to close down unprofitable factories. They would have charge of sales and exports, would procure raw materials, secure tonnage for export, and arrange foreign exchange. These ideas are typical of the views which are being ventilated in many quarters in Germany, and there can be little doubt that in the view of the German industrialist he is entitled to differential and favourable treatment at the hands of the State, in return for acceptance of the main body of taxation.It is noticeable that in all the arrangements contemplated by the employing classes for post-war reconstruction there is no consideration of the claims of the working-classes. As was reported last week, the demands of Labour have been formulated in no uncertain tones, and an early opportunity will be taken to analyse these demands and to compare them with the analogous claims of Labour in this countrv.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.*The continued lull on the Western front has induced an almost complete silence in the Labour papers on military affairs. Argument continues, however, on the power, of an International Socialist Conference to end hostilities earlier than they will be ended by fighting, and to secure a democratic and lasting peace. On the one side &quot; Justice &quot; asks what good purpose would result from negotiations with a man like Scheidemann as representative of the German Social Democratic Majority. The writer, while not objecting to meet Germans, sees no prospect of peace resulting from such a conference, but rather foresees the danger of more friction. He notes that, though two months have elapsed since the memorandum of the Inter-Allied Conference was sent to Germany, there has been no response. M. Huysmans, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; points out that the German and Austrian papers have published the covering letter, but not the text, and that they have made few comments. Miss Sylvia Pankhurst in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; has, on the other hand, no doubts. Unless the war ends soon the great light of the Russian Revolution, which means so much to the world, may be extinguished. Only the people can make a people&apos;s world or a people&apos;s peace. Why is no protest being made against the many attempts to lower the red flag and submerge the Socialist movement in a compost of pseudo-pacific elements?
Foreign Affairs.In the &quot; New Age &quot; a pamphlet by a French writer is the occasion for an article condemning the project of a League of Nations. Such a league would not abolish the need for private arrangements between States comparable to the secret treaties. A league must have powers strong enough to coerce even Germany, and that is an accurate measure of the extent to which pacifists can offer disarmament.An article on Persia in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; traces the history of the country during the last 30 years, giving specie,! prominence to the Majlis, and its decline and fall, and to the removal of the American who was appointed to reorganise Persian finance. Russian revolutionaries sympathise with the Persian democracy, and the writer asks what view Great Britain will take.A summary of articles on Russia, taken from an American paper, appears in &quot; Justice.&quot; Bolshevism has failed in reconstruction, and has imposed a despotism as tyrannical as that of the Czar. It is building a Socialist State from the top down. Unless moderate Socialists are able to reorganise a democracy, the masses will relapse into complete anarchy.A strong agitation is being fomented by the &quot; Call,&quot; &quot; Herald,&quot; and &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; to secure a new trial for one Tom Mooney, who was sentenced to death in 1916 in San Francisco on a- charge of complicity in a bomb outrage.Movie Affairs.Papers of all shades of opinion unite in pressing for a reduction of the sentence passed on John McLean, or for a change in the class of imprisonment from penal servitude to the first division. The &quot; Herald &quot; attempts to argue that he was merely advocating Socialism, while Sir E. Carson and others have not only talked revolu-tion but have acted. &quot; Justice,&quot; though it disagrees entirely with his language and attitude, supports the plea for mercy, on the ground that he is a good Socialist, and his health may suffer in jail.The rejection of proportional representation is regretted, especially by the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; which says the existing system favours the Tories. Criticism of the new restrictions on railway travel is not very bitter, though the &quot;Clarion &quot; remarks they will hurt the poor man. A more favourite topic is the wastefulness of railway management.A Hacks on Government.Strictures are now directed more particularly against Mr. Lloyd George than against the Government generally. The &quot;Herald &quot;suggests that the rejection of peace terms was not really the Premier&apos;s own doing, but &quot;was due to the extortionate demands of the French and Italian Governments, or perhaps to fear of the North-cliffe Press. It wants a Government neither by soldiers nor by the press, but by the people who serve and suffer. To the &quot; Call &quot; the important result of the debate on General Maurice&apos;s letter is the fact that an official Opposition party has arisen. This party may, however, in time put pressure on the revolutionary section of the people to cease from disturbing the great work of peace by unconstitutional methods.Ireland.Comments on Irish policy are brief but emphatic. In one article the &quot; Herald &apos;&apos; compares the&apos;Irish with the Indians and Egyptians as merely demanding the right to choose for themsleves, or the treatment which we are fighting to secure for Belgium, Servia, &amp;c. It believes that Ireland and India would choose to remain partners with Britain and the self-governing Dominions. In a second article, Mr. Brailsford upbraids Labour for its indifference and preoccupation in parliamentary work. The &quot; New Age &quot; has a reasoned article on the principles involved in certain of the Irish claims. Both the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; unite with the &quot; Herald &quot;in complaints against the want of unanimity between various sections of. Labour, and see little prospect of organised action on behalf of Ireland.Food.Practically no criticisms of the administration of food appear this week. &quot;Justice&quot; complains that the Board of Agriculture has interfered unnecessarily in the distribution of fish, and it asks why Government does not provide cold storage for bacon at all ports.[1.100-30]
III-District Reports.London and South-E&apos;astern.The situation in this area remains satisfactory, and none but short and unimportant strikes are reported.The Shop Stewards&quot; Executive are circulating a letter of protest against the harsh treatment of conscientious objectors, and are asking them to write letters of protest to the Prime Minister; the letter is also signed by Church dignitaries, includ-ing the Dean of Lewisham.At the Royal Gun Factory some discontent has arisen owing to the treatment of one of the foremen, who was asked by the management to resign on account of loss of output; this was resented by the workmen, who considered that the management was showing favouritism. Another foreman, who is unpopular, has been a much shorter time in the works.The Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation in London have refused to take up the matter of a Miners&apos; Mobility Bureau, the scheme having been rejected at a meet-ing held on the 15th.The Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors at Crayford are at present showing considerable resentment against the A.S.E., and are stirring up agitation against them.The cancelling of the Finsbury Park Demonstration on the 5th May has caused resolutions of protest from both the London Trades Council and the St. Pancras Branch of the N.U.R.South-Western.Press reports have been received of the exceedingly low rate of pay for women in the building trade in Aylesbury. They are said to receive bd. an hour, while the men get Is. 2d. Attempts to organise the work, in order to remedy this low rate all round, were met by threats of a lock-out and other measures.West Midland.With the exception of the strike at Messrs. Austin&apos;s Works, Birmingham, which is dealt with in Part IV, the situation in this area is quiet and satisfactory. A meeting representing the metal, wire, and tube industry at Birmingham, sent a message congratulating the Prime Minister on the result of the Maurice debate, and denouncing pacifism.Complaints are made in Birmingham that the alteration in the times of the last trams running to the suburbs compels the workers to walk several miles after a long day&apos;s work.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this district is on the whole quiet, though free discussion con-tinues. The main interest centres in demands for increased rates of wages by sections of the wool textile workers. The grant of the. demands of the woolcombers and warehousemen seems likely to result in further applications from the wool sorters and heavy woollen workers. The question of increased hours, necessitated by the taking of men for the army, also receives considerable attention, and opinions are divided as to whether the claim should concentrate on higher rates with no increase in hours, or should, while yielding on the latter point, demand a further increase in earnings during the longer hours. The I.L.P. is laying stress on the large profits of employers, and pointing to the losses of workers at a time when trade was slack after war broke out. It seems probable that the wool workers will carry out their threat of a strike unless their demands are largely conceded.The appointment of five well-known trade unionists at Nottingham as Justices of the Peace has caused great satisfaction.North-Western.The situation in this district shows considerable disturbance, and the temper of the workpeople is described by the Ministry of Munitions as excited, while a tendency to strike upon the least provocation is somewhat noticeable.Meetings of shop stewards have, however, been marked by considerable moderation of tone, and at a meeting of the Barrow section on the 12th the suggestion the movement was in any way a peace movement was denied.
The Reconstruction Sub-Committee had various matters under consideration at Liverpool on the 14th, the most important of which was the demand for canteens close to the works. This matter seems to be most urgent at Messrs. Harland and Wolffs, Liverpool, where strong measures are threatened unless the Liquor Control Board take some steps in this matter. Discussion of the dispute at Messrs. A. V. Roe&apos;s was postponed until further particulars could be obtained, while reports on the question of a 47-hour week and the employment of non-union labour by the White Star Company were referred to the Mersey Federation.The Liverpool Postal Clerks&apos; Association has passed a protest against the restrictions on travelling and increases in season-ticket rates, on the ground that this does not solve the problem of unnecessary travelling.Northern.The situation in this area still remains very quiet, and few reports have been received.As regards recruiting the information is still satisfactory, and the workers. seem willing to meet the demands made upon them.South Wales.In this area conditions are fairly satisfactory, and. few disputes seem, at present to be in progress.The comb-out appears to be causing considerable anxiety among the employers in some parts of the district, owing to the fear that an insufficient number of skilled men may be retained in the works with a consequent diminution of output.Scotland.Further improvement is evident in the conditions in this district.The only report of trouble is among the sheet metal workers, engaged mainly upon aeroplane work, who are exerting pressure to obtain higher wages and to pre-vent dilution in the small works. These efforts meet with considerable success, as such workmen are easily able to transfer their services in the event of opposition.Complaints are being made that owing to changes in the organisation of the Shipyard Labour Department there is some difficulty in settling the petty grievances which crop up frequently.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation remains satisfactory, and strikes are few and generally unimportant.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 6 new cases and 16 old ones. In all new cases the number of men affected is small, and work was resumed in 21 cases.The strike at Messrs. Grayson&apos;s, Garston, has ended, but the men have given notice to the firm that they will strike again in three weeks if a timekeeper who hais not joined the union1, was not discharged. A small stoppage of smiths and stampers in the Birmingham area, which took place without notice, is under investigation.The Ministry of Munitions mentions only four strikes during the week, involving l^ti&amp;bfutb. All of these were settled except one. The strike at Messrs. Austin Motors, Ltd., near Birmingham, led to a good deal of agitation, and attempts were made to obtain the sympathy of all factories in Birmingham. While a meeting,was being field on the 15th May aeroplanes distributed leaflets, but the effect was only to incense the meeting. The men are now expected to resume work on a, promise of arbitration.Smaller strikes occurred in a shell shop at Darlington where 500 girls stopped work without previous ^complaint, and at Manchester and Hammersmith over the appointment of a forewoman and charge hand respectively.The War Office Contracts Department reports only one new stoppage at Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, where trouble had previously arisen over rates on a new army clothing contract.
The Goal Controller reports 17 new cases affecting 27,000 men, but 13 of these, besides 2 old cases, have been settled.Men at the Tredegar collieries remained on strike till the 17th May. At a meeting of the Joint Disputes Committee of the Conciliation Board, the owners&apos; representatives refused to discuss the dispute till the men returned to work, and the Coal Controller declined to intervene for the same reason, though, promising to receive a deputation immediately on resumption. The leaders accepted this view, but the men took time to decide. The strike at Ben!lev Colliery, near Doncaster, still continues, but an early settlement. is expected. The extreme demand for the dismissal of all &quot;post-war&quot; miners is not supported by the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association. Of 8 other collieries where work stopped in Yorkshire, 4 reopened before the holidays.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department has 39 new controversial cases and 92 old. Settlement has been made in 35 cases.Nearly half the new cases occurred in the Glasgow area, chiefly among workers in metal.   No case is of importance.A dispute between boilermakers and the Manchester Ship Canal has been referred to the Canal Control Board. The painters have a dispute with the Manchester Dry Docks Company about a change to time rates, and another with a, firm in Liverpool, about the 12-Jr per cent, bonus. The former has been referred to the Joint Council.Five disputes are reported by the Ministry of Munitions. One between the Belfast Corporation and its tramway and electrical employees was settled after a meeting held at the Ministry of Labour. The Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland object to women being employed on the manufacture of 50-lb. bombs, unless they are paid the full moulders&apos; rate for placing the core, whether they are skilled or unskilled. Disputes about wages include claims by carpenters and joiners on aeroplane work at Farnham, and a refusal to work overtime at Messrs. T. &quot;C. Thompson and Son, Manchester.The War Office Contracts Department has only one new case, an application by the National Leather Trades Federation for the \2\ per cent, and 1\ per cent, increases to all workers, male and female, engaged in the preparation of leather or- articles made from it.No new cases are reported by the Coal Controller.The Committee on Production dealt with 46 cases in the week, 25 being in London and 21 in Scotland. Among the former were further applications from the National Union of Clerks, and a number of claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus in the soap trade and miscellaneous businesses. The cases in Scotland affected the shipbuilding trade, the Steel Makers&apos; Association, Aberdeen and Kilmarnock Engineering Trades, Scottish Pig Iron Trade, Scottish Vehicle Trade, and the Glasgow Corporation.The Chief Industrial Commissioner registered 130 new cases, of which 49 are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus. Cases are chiefly in the engineering, shipbuilding, and other metartrades groups. At the conference on the building trade dispute it was explained that the rate of Is. M. per hour agreed to at Liverpool was accepted by employers who were but slightly affected, while Government, which is the chief employer in the district, was not represented. A proposal to refer the matter to the Committee on Production was not welcomed by the men.In the carting industry a provisional national agreement to increase wages to 255. per week over rates before the war, is to be submitted to the Committee on Production. . This increase corresponds to the advance just conceded to railwaymen,. and is in lieu of the 12i Per cent- bonus in the munitions trades.D. J. SHACKLETON.o
