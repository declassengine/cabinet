Memorandum by the Ministry of Foofl,1,   On November 23rd 1917 the War Cabinet decided (^ar Cabinet 267) Minute 2) to permit the release of Wines from bond on the basis of the amounts released in 1916 instead of to the extent of only 50$ of those amounts j which was the limit fixed by the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order 1917,   In accordance Yfith this decision Lord Rhondda amended the Order so as to permit from October 1st 1917 persons to whom wine was delivered in 1916 to obtain from bond during each half year after October 1st 1917 an amount not exceeding half the amount released to thorn in 1916,2.   The object of the amended order, which was toftjLlov; more ?&apos;ine to come upon the market with a view tochecking an increased demand for spirits and bringingvrithin the reach ef the working classes a larger prepor-tion of the available beer, has not been attained tcthe full extent that was anticipated with the result&apos;that serious complaints of shortage of supplies and ofinflated prices have reached the Ministry of Pood,   Thechief causes of difficulty are as follows:-(1)    Some distributors possess wine in bondbut no olearance rights, while others possess clearance rights and no wine in bond,(2)    Some distributors with clearance rights and wine in bond are in districts where the population has decreased, while others have insufficient clearance rights and no wine in bond, where the population has increased owing to an influx of troops or. munition workers^RELEASE OP WINES PROM BOND.
(3) Some distributors have held backtheir clearances either with a view to soiling them, or in the hope of obtaining possession of special wine3 on arrival in this country.    In cases where these wine3 have not arrived in time, quite a considerable quantity of clearances have not been used by the end of March 1918, further reducing the amount available for tho public.3.   In these circumstances, after consultation with the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) and tho Board of Customs 2c Excise, I ask for the authority of the V,&apos;ar Cabinet to remove all restrictions on the delivery of wine from bond.    I am informed by the Board of Customs and Excise th&amp;t in their opinion it may reasonably be estimated that the removal of all restrictions would not result in the rate of delivery of wine for home consumption exceeding the rate for 1916, so that the relaxation for vjhich I now ask will on this shewing do no more than it was hoped to effect by the V!-ar Cabinet1 a decision of November 23rd 1917.4.   The position has already become critical and I shall be glad to have an early ruling from the War Cabinet.Ministry of Food,25th May, 1918.
