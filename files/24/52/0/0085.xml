Prime IvJiniBter and War   the -Foreign Secretary could be present.^      Accordingly it &quot; abinet.yesterday appeared as the first business after statements.   In 17,     spite of this it was not reached and 0! observe that it is not inute on. the Agenda at all today;    Meanwhile Japan has put certain 7*      very important questions to us on the answer to which herfuture action in Siberia probably depends.     Delay will convey to her again as it has in the past&apos;an impression-of hesitation and uncertainty,     bhe will be more than ever convinced that we are not in earnest in our interventionist policy - That impression will spread as it did before to Washington and the President will become more immovable than ever.     Procedure of this kind has already lost us four months and as I think has seriously&apos;if not&apos;fatally compromised our position in Russia.     If the Cabinet are against intervention lot them say soft     If they are in favour of it-let them ta&amp;c the necessary measures, to give that policy a chance of success. &apos; To do neither.one thing nor the other is in any case fatal. 1 trust you may.be able to bring this Note to the attention of the Cabinet this morning,&apos;- - (Initialled).
