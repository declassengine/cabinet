km uThe question raised in the General Staff Memorandum of the 9th May on the subject of rfoxioo was not, as Mr. Balfour appears to have supposed,  the management or mis-management by the Foreign Offiv^e of our relations with Mwxico, but the vastly More important question of the general policy to be pursued towards that country in the future,, having regard to the military danger of American troops being diverted from the Western Front.The g-eneral Staff Kemorandum would have been directed to the Foreign Office in accordance with the usual procedure, had not that Department, without previous consultation with the War Office, despatched to Lord Reading a telegram on the subject of Mexico which referred directly to military matters of vital importance but did not deal adequately with the military considera-tions involved.There is, however, yet another reason vrh$r the General Staff deaided to submit a note to the War Cabinet, namely, that the situation in Mexico has been the subject of joint considera-tion by the three Departments concerned/ throughout the war, and especially since October 1917, when, owing to information supplied by a secret service agent, fairly definite proof, subsequently confirmed from other secret sources, was obtained that Carranza was intriguing with the enemy.In January last the first of a series of Conferences took place at the Foreign Office at which the Admiralty and War Office were represented, and at all of which, except the first, Mr. Balfour himself took the chair.     In spite, however, of these conferences and the resulting telegrams from the Foreign Office, the situation in Mexico drifted from bad to worse and it appeared desirable to bring strong pressure to bear on the United States Government in order to induce them, to adopt a joint policy with the other two Powers concerned.     It was with this view that the paper in question was prepared, and it was hoped that the War Cabinet might, if they considered the matter sufficiently important, induce the Supreme War Council to send a telegram to this effect to the President of the United States.In this connection attention is drawn to Despatch No.160 from Mr. Cummins dated 23rd April, 191A.MEXICO,168General Staff,25th May, 1918.fed. )Henry Wilson,C;I*GcS.
