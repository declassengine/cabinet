MEMORANDUM ON

THE CAUCASUS.

The rapid advance of the Germans eastwards through the Ukraine ?rves to draw attention once again to their evident designs upon the ?ucasus which have been outlined and emphasised in several reports ?ring the past months.  At present it looks as if they were aiming advancing along the Vladikavkaz railway to Baku, and the mere ?pidity of their advance, covering as they have done a territory of ?r hundred miles from Odessa to Rostoff in about a fortnight&apos;s time, sufficient commentary on the nature of the resistance which has been ? up by Bolshevik or any other elements. So far as the younger ?ssacks are concerned they seem to have fallen under the influence of ? Bolsheviks, and it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the ?ter have been acting in conjunction with the Germans in the ocoupa-?n of Rostoff, the more so as a portion, of the Black Sea Fleet was ?centrated by the Bolsheviks in the port of Novorossisk where it was ?nd to be captured sooner or later by the Germans, if it did not ?render. As a result, not merely do the Germans secure complete ?trol of the Black Sea, but they will also be able to send ammuni-?n and guns from Constanza to Batum. It is important also to re-?se that tho stock of cereals in northern Caucasia is always very ?stantial, and recent Russian wireless telegrams indicated that at quantities of grain were being sent from those regions to ?kestan and elsewhere. The annual production of the Kuban district ?not less than fifty million poods. Oil-cake for cattle feeding is ?o an industry connected with Ekaterinodar and Novorossisk, while ?tain silver-lead and copper mines and the oil-fields at Grozny fall ?in the same radius of attack.

The importance of the latter as well as the corresponding oil-ilds at Baku can hardly he overestimated.    If Germany secures these L-fiel&amp;s she really controls the river-boat industry on the Volga, h shipping on the Caspian and in a measure Siberia,    The coal mines I the Bon basin are most probably water-logged by this time and at U rate hardly likely to supply much coal:   for there is no incentive if the miners to work.     Germany cannot stand over these men with lionets in the pits and compel them to work.     On the other hand, the l-fields represent fuel in quantity which carl be obtained compari-lely easily.According to the telegraphic news it is now clearly apparent that I Germans and Turks have succeeded in vanning over to their side the jial Tatar elements of Trans-Caucasijj.     On the day that Ears was l:en the Tatar National Council notified Gegetchkori, ^resident of the Ins-Caucasia Republic, that the Tatars as a nation would now retire lira the Trans-Caucasian Republic.     The only group to take exception pthis action has beon a small minority composed principally of Ber-j,ais who are really immigrants and have taken this step at the in-j.gation of their clergy.     Hopes based upon a possible division of I Tatars on religious lines were always of the slenderest.    Eighty-le fo of the Tatars of the Caucasus are Sunnis like their Russian co-jjigionists, while the 3hi&apos;ites in Trans-Caucasia arc principallyse Persian immigrants.     Daghestan and the Terek regions on thejjthorn side of the range had already announced their intention ofIfining a separate Republic, and according to telegram 297 (Moscow) o* May llth, from the Vice-Conteul at Baku, the Chechen have been al-idy attacking Grozny for some -time past.Accordingly the present Cabinet is composed simply of Georgians i Armenians, upon whom the Germans and Turks have been pressing peace ;otiations, with the threat of a resumption of military measures of reased severity if they arc not accepted.     The position of the rgians and the Armenians has feecomo desperate, now that it is too/late
stto to supply thorn with more munitions through Persia, and the anti-ppated result of the negotiations1 - peaoe on the hasis of the surron-or of Batum, Kars and Ardahan - will not be surprising, for undor jdern conditions of warfare, it is very doubtful whether a guerilla Jrfaro could be continued by them.    It has already been proved in the ise of Serbia, where the geographical configuration is very similar that of Trans-Caucasia, that mountain chains prove no obstacle to army well provided with German modern artillery.    Iluoh greater ira-Irtance should be attaohed even now to this Trans-dauoasian field than I) the Mesopotamian field of action, for should the Trans-Caucasian pdlway be captured in its entirety, a direct route through Baku and ans-Caspia towards the borders of Afghanistan would be open to the rmans.    It has also been emphasised in previous reports that a fur-er German-Turkish design is the separation of the worth-wostern pro-noe of Azerbaijan from Persia and the linking of it with the Govern-nts of Brivan, Elizabetpol and Baku as a separate Mohamme&amp;naB princi-lity.    The urgency of this is founa in the German intention to ild a railway-line from Trebizond through Brzerum to Tabriz and Bht.    The distriots traversed by this line are populated largely Kurds and Turcomans (Shahsovans), and the domination of Trans-Cau-BiS that will follow from such railway construction will further en-Le Germany to establish a direct line to the frontiers of Afghanistan. In view of the grave situation with which the Georgian and Ar-sn peoples are faced,, it is worth considering whether steps should f be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to issue some declaration of pathy with the former people in particular, in their present situ-on.    Up till now the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the al nationalities were conducted through the Trans-Cauoasian Govern-.t which has gone in pieces, leaving the National Councils alone in session of the field for all practical purposes.    The failure of Allies to supply war material to the Georgians and Armenians will exploited by the Germans in the attempt to destroy the faith of-53- /these
; these peoplee in the final triumph of the Allied cause.    Particularly liua the case of the Georgians would such on expression of sympathy with I thorn in connection with their aspirations towards independence have a [peculiar effect, inasmuch as no notioo whatever has hitherto been taken I of-that small nationality, while almost every declaration made by the fillies has included some word of hope for the Armenian people.    Such la declaration seems to be the more necessary inasmuch as there is good treason to believe that Germany is on the eve of fcroo3jftixfiing the in-liepondence of Georgia, and the absence of an expression of interest ton behalf of His Majesty1e Government will give strong moral support I bo the Central Powers.    It is useless to wait for any reoohstitution [Of. Russia in the immediate future, and to take such a step would be Ifco do little more than has been dene in the aase of Esthonia.
