SEC RET, ^6LEAKAGE OF SECRET INFORMATION.MlWM-MiOM^DUM FOR m WAR f)M.........3**&apos;I wish to bring to the notice of the War Cabinet and my Colleagu.es in the Goverrmeiro generally, what I regard as a very serious-and very dangerous breach of Official secrecy.This is by no means an isolated case.      We have all experience of how official and secret matter is gossiped about in both Offices; Clubs, and in drawing rooms, and how it leaks out to the Press.     It is, however, usually difficult to bring hpme the facts to the offender, and in spite of the handicap from time to time which has been imposed upon us by breaches of secrecy, the case which I am about to give is the first definite instance which has been brought home to the offender by the Admiralty, and which the very need for secrecy does not prevent us ventilating in a confidential cabinet paper..The &quot;Evening Standard11 in its &quot;Londoners Diary&quot; on the 15th May issued the following paragraph:-&quot;l see that the Admiralty declined to &quot;respond to the request of Mr. R0P0 Houston to -  &quot;give details of the 1recent satisfactory&apos;sinkings1 &quot;of enemy submarines, but I can assure my readers, &quot;on very high authority, that they &amp;re highly &quot;satisfactory.^ :      &apos;&apos;In a recent week, for instance, no fewer - than five U-boats are definitely known to have been &quot;sunk,      These five included two of the new large &quot;submarines from which the German Admiralty and &quot;people expected so much,&quot;Five submarines in one week is more than twice the rate at &quot;which the Germans can turn them &quot;out.      Of course, the average weekly s.inkings are--, &quot;not so high as that, but the average rate is a - 1  &quot;great improvement on thats of a year ago, and even &quot;of that of six months ago3&apos;.It has been the well known policy of the Admiralty approved by the War Cabinetj not to publish figures of sinkings of submarines, and it is only on very exceptional occasions and for specific reasons,that this policy has boen departed from by the Admiralty or the Prime Minister. The Board of Admiralty are increasingly convinced of the soundness of the policy and have every intention of adhering to it.The sinking of Submarines is reported to the far Cabinet through the daily statement -made to them by the Admiralty representative or through -the Secret Weekly &quot;Naval Appreciation&quot; .and is issued in no other way.The/
The figure given as 5 in a week was in the Weekly Naval Appreciation last issued before the 15th May.The issue of the information to the Press was directly against the Admiralty policy,     In these circumstances the Admiralty, decided to exercise their powers under Section 53 of the Defence of the Realm Act and served the Editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; with a notice requiring him to disclose the source of his information.     When this has been done I propose to continue serving notices until the Chain is officially and formally complete, and I trust I shall have the support of the Cabinet in doing this, The correspondent of the &quot;Evening Standard1&apos; has however verbally confessed that he was told of these figures by a Parliamentary Undersecretary of one of the Ministries, and that gentleman has admitted the action complained of in conversation with the authorised Admiralty Official and has said that he always disapproved of the Admiralty policy of secrecy.      Whether it was indiscretion or for other reasons that this violation of confidential information took place, it is equally an intolerable position, and my Naval Advisers have formally represented to me that unless the desired secrecy can be attained, the conduct of Naval warfare will be seriously prejudiced0Another&apos;and connected case pan be quoted against the same paper The Evening Standard&quot; in which this time actual Naval operations are being prejudiced by the leakage of information.      Although I am not. so clear as to where the leak occurred, it appears most probable that that also was through confidential reports issued to the Cabinet, The circumstances are these:-On the 11th of May a British submarine successfully attacked one of the large German Submarine Cruisers off the Azores,      This was reported to the Cabinet on Wednesday 15th May (Minutes 412),It will be noticed that the occurrence was reported to the War Cabinet on the 15th May, and from a reference to the first page of this Memorandum it will be noted that that very evening the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reported the sinking of two large submarines.      As a matter&apos;of fact only one was sunk though two were attacked.On Saturday the 25th May, for Operational reasons which I can assure the War Cabinet were of great importance, the Admiralty issued the following Communique to the Press:-&quot;One of our Atlantic escort submarines on return to her base reports that on May 11th, in &apos;the latitude of Cape St Vincent, whilst proceeding &quot;to meet a convoy, she sighted and sank a German submarine of the &quot;so-called cruiser type.    A heavy&quot;sea/
sea was running at the time,, and there were no &quot;survivors,* Shortly afterwards another enemy submarine &quot;was sighted, but, by swift diving-, she escaped the fate of her consort,. &quot;in view of this being the first crikiser &quot;submarine to be destroyed, it has been decided &quot;to depart from the usual rule of not announcing, t!the destruction of individual enemy submarines/1and on Monday the 27th, the following paragraph appeared in the &quot;Evening Standard&apos;1, quoting their notification of the loth May, which must have shown the enemy that we had knowledge of the destruction of the Cruiser submarine before we published the announcement, a matter which we were most particularly anxious that they should not know.&quot;The Admiralty announcement of Saturday, &quot;reporting the destruction of one of Germany&apos;s &quot;new submarine cruisers, will,we11 repay careful &quot;studv.In the first place, it may be borne in &quot;mind that, according to information from a &quot;neutral source, published in April, these newest &quot;enemy vessels were to come into commission for &quot;the first time during May6     If that statement -&quot;was accurate, the sinking of one of them on May &quot;llth (first alluded to in this Diary on May 15th) &quot;was an exceedingly prompt piece of work;    But &quot;this is really by the way0&apos;   It is the unusually &quot;suggestive wording of the. Admiralty report that &quot;really matters&quot;,To summarise, therefore, we have this sequence of facts, that we knew that a certain Parliamentary Under-Secretary told, on the confession of the correspondent of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and on his own confession, the number of submarines which we had sunk in a certain week and that the paper published that information - information well known to be secret 5 which is only given to the War Cabinet Office and in Cabinet Session,-      The informer must have known, andin fact admits that he did know, that it was against the policy of the Admiralty to publish this information, and the newspaper in announcing it prefaces the paragraph by stating that the Admiralty had refused to give the information in the House of Commons,      We also know that the Admiralty reported to the Cabinet that we had sunk one enemy craft, in an encounter with two enemy submarine cruisers on the 15th May and that the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; gave that information with a slight error upon that very evening,, and thaWSnen the Admiralty issued an official communication on the 25th of the month, which had a direct Naval operational significance, and was carefully timed and worded for a &quot;specific purpose, the&quot;Evening&quot; Standard on account of the confidential information which it was&apos;irregularly/
irregularly supplied with^ was able to contradict in effect the Admiralty communique,, by showing that we had the information much earlier,Those who are not in touch with Naval operations cannot perhaps appreciate the very serious and grave handicap under-which the Intelligence side of an Operational Staff labours, if this kind of breach of secrecy occurs, It is intolerable that such leakage should occur, and if the Navy is not to be seriously handicapped in warfare steps must be taken to ensure the secrecy of their operationsI ask that the War Cabinet should devote some suitable time to deal with this evil, of which only isolated incidents are quoted,,(Signed)    ERIC GEDDES.5. 18,
