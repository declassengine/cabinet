trt. %a*jl^      242/This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Maje3ty&apos;s Governme.   )Desirability  of  increasing  the  rnafltity1^ of Hews-Print.Memorandum by tho president of the Board of Trade..).     I have read tho Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Information on tho above subject (paper Gr.T.4611).   I have no criticisms to offer as regards the general con-siderations urged on page 1 of the Memorandum in favour of increasing the  uantity of newsprint available, with which I personally aprree.The paper Controller has taken, And is taking, active steps which it is hoped will make it possible to increase the supply of newsprint &quot;by encouraging the utilisation of waste products, especially sawdust and wood slats.     To this end a new system of requisitioning supplies of waste paper into mills is in course of pre-paration &quot;by the Controller and will he launched shortly. A large number of mills are being adapted to the manufac-turo of strawboard against the nozt harvest and strawboard is now being produced at four mills equal in cuality to any hitherto imported from Holland.    Thus waste paper, hitherto used for;&apos;board:j making, is gradually being released and can be ultilisod in the manufacture of paper.After consultation with the paper Controller I am satisfied that every effort for increasing tho supply of newsprint is being made by his Department., without making any increased demand upon shipping.    Of course if shipping and.finance permit, the trade, as well as the Department, would welcome an increased inport of material,),       On page 2 of the Memorandum it is subnitted that in -return for increased supplies the newspapers v,ould bewilling to accept some conditions as to the use of thisadditional supply in giving additional. i.ai news, and newsuseful for the nublic interest, (This/
This is largely a question of policy and in my opinion vail be found of doubtful utility and extremely difficult to work,(3).       As regards the suggestion that the Ministry ofInformation should be the source of any control,I am unable to understand the first of the reasons advanced for this arrangement, namely, because the Ministry of Information is responsible to parliament.    The Board of Trade is also responsible to Parliament and the paper Controllerrs Depart-ment is a Department of the Board of Trade.   In principle it appears to me that this proposal to hand over to the Ministry of Information the handling of all the distribution of paper to newspapers, involving as it does in effect the establish-meht of a dual control of paper, is open to the strongest objections.    The principle on which the Department of the Paper Controller was established was that the co-ordination of paper supply and distribution should be in its hands;   its task in the rationing of a diminished supply and attending to its allocation ever an increasing demand.   This is a task neither pleasant in its nature nor easy of aocom-lislineat, but its performance vail he rendered utterly impracticable if at the time that this Department is rationing, another Department is to be handing out suoplementary rations at tho discretion of another Control, and during the good behavior of the recipients. - *In ir.&quot; view the proner course (assuming that the War Cabinet decide that the Ministry of Information have established a case for additional supplies of paper for the newspapers) is for my Department to be asked to find such additional amount of paper for newspapers as may be decided upon.    The Controller of Paper would then review his programme and be able to report what additional facilities for importation, if any, would be required to meet the increased demand for newsprint.A. H.
