This Document in the property of theSecretary of State for India.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.IfI regretted to learn on landing of (he decision of:&apos; the War Cabinet with regard to temporary Commissions for Indians, and as I am inclined to think that the decision may have been partly dlie to the fact I hat the telegrams from India did not sufficiently explain the situation, I venture to trouble the Cabinet with a memorandum on the subject.Whilst the Viceroy and I were at Dehra Dun Hearing the completion of our Report on constitutional changes in India, telegrams arrived from the Prime Minister asking for increased co-operation in the war. The specific references to Asia and the East in the telegrams led us to the conclusion that it was our duty to see how much could be clone, and how far we could make a new contribution which the War Cabinet and public opinion would regard as satisfactory. We were both mindful of criticism that had been made in ihe past, and the extravagant figures of possibilities which had been published by irresponsible people. The second and secret telegram from the Prime Minister addressed to the Army Department told us definitely that in his opinion the war was spreading eastwards, and ended with a statement that the Viceroy should &quot; do everything in your power to increase the Indian Establishment for war, not only in troops, but,&quot; &amp;c.Here was a demand that we should do everything in our power to increase the Indian Establishment for war, and my information leads me to think that by the time all the men that we can get in India are trained (for it takes longer to train an Indian soldier in tlio Indian climate than a British soldier at home I believe the shortest period allowed is 1*8 weeks), we may require every man that Ave can get. Is a civilian student of the war indul gmg in empty s peculation, when he thinks that it is not impossible that this year&apos;s campaign on the Western front will not leave the German incapable of any further effort in any theatre of Avar, although it may leave him convinced that no &quot;useful purpose is to be served by attacks in France or Flanders? Is it not then likely that he should determine to endeavour to reconquer the territories that we have conquered iiHthe East? Not only would he thus wrest from us the only territory we have conquered, but he might achieve disastrous consequences to us by startling the Eastern world and threatening the security of India. Is it not also possible that the exhaustion, of our own man power would make it highly desirable in such an emergency to rely in the main upon troops raised in India for the defence of India, Mesopotamia, and Palestine ? 1 do not believe that anyone could predict the effect of a German-inspired invasion of Persia or of Afghanistan upon the North-West Frontier. I am certain that thinking Indians are very alarmed, at the possibilities that we may be too much occupied in the West to maintain our traditional function of defending the Indian border, and-this feeling is at the bottom of a widespread demand to be trained in the art of defence. For these reasons, and because of the Prime Ministers own appeal, Ave determined that the situation Avas sufficiently grave and serious to risk the slight prolongation of my stay in India, and therefore on my own responsibility I suggested to the Viceroy that Ave should proceed at once to Simla, summon his colleagues and discuss the situation fully. (I telegraphed to the India Office and to the Prime Minister Avhat I was doing.) We discussed all matters not only with his Government, but with the Heads of Departments and Secretaries, but I will confine my remarks to the mau-poAver problem, partly because this is the only matter upon which the Cabinet has expressed an opinion, and partly because the consideration of the financial proposals which I hoped to make had to be postponed on account of the unfortunate Currency crisis which occurred at that time.We started by trying to ascertain Avhat Avas the number of recruits which could be handled by the military authorities. This question Avas complicated by the fact that no billeting is possible in India, that the discipline and health of the recruits could not be maintained under any form of billeting, and that it would necessitate building (and building materials are scarce)SS 017   60  5/18 A
and the use of existing buildings intended for other purposes. There was also the question of officers to train the men. Without going into the subject in. detail, it is sufficient to state that I understood from the Commander-iiir Chief: that he could deal with and use 500,000 men.The next question to decide was whether that number could bo obtained, and, if. it could be ubtained, whether they would be serviceable lighting material. The universal opinion Avas that on certain conditions it could. To anyone not conversant with, the deiails it would seem, strange that there was some difficulty about raising so small a number out of a population of 300,000,000, but the limitations are very real.il: it should prove possible to get more than this number, well and good. I think we were all agreed that it; the Prime AliuisteFs telegram was to be taken seriously, we must deal with whatever we could get to the best of our ability, but that we should first concentrate on this 500,000.The first condition which had to be met was that recruits should be assured that if they entered the ranks as privates, and fought their way by valour in the Field and by gaining the confidence of their fellow-soldiers, access to the commissioned ranks should be open to them. The voting Englishman who enters the Army as a private has this prospect before him. I am sure you could not. get him, and 1 think you ought not to get him, if he had not. The fact that a Field Marshall baton is carefully concealed among other impedimenta in the soldieFs knapsack is one of the basic principles of the success of His Majesty&apos;s Armies in tho Field, and although few, if any, privates are destined to wield it, it is the emblem which underlies the morale of our troops. We were all agreed that if we were to invite the Indians to come to our assistance in this war of democracy, this principle must be established. A refusal of it means that you will not get the men. If you do not want the men, the Prime Ministers telegram would never have been sent. The intention is to grant temporary commissions on the recommendations of commanding officers to men in the ranks Who would be acceptable to their fellow officers and who had proved their capacity. There is no intention of giving an Indian a commission because he is an Indian, but only to give it on the same terms as an Englishman could earn it. The selected candidate would have to go through the necessary training before lie took his place with his brother officers.I would pause here to observe that this proposal has no connection whatever with the proposals hitherto made by the Government of India for the granting of commissions. Those proposals were intended asa permanent alteration in the fabric of the Army. This is a method of earning by gallantry and good conduct in the Field, purely temporary commissions for the term of the war only. It is obviously inapplicable to peace conditions. Jt is difficult to foresee what the Indian Army will be like after the war, but no one dreams of requiring 500,000 men under arms. It, is meant as a temporary measure to suit war conditions, to stimnlate recruiting and to assist us in providing officers at a time when British officers are necessarily scarce.This, then, was the first condition of the possibility of assistance on this scale. AYe did not think that the men would come, or ought to be asked to come, without any prospect of obtaining commissioned rank before them. It was then held by the Government of India, I think unanimously, that the mere statement of this principle would not be sufficient, but that it must be applied on a liberal scale to show the Indians that we meant business. The military authorities were of opinion that there were large numbers of men who could be trained as officers, and principles have been so often announced in India without being applied that it was felt that a mere promise would not be sufficient. The Government, therefore, unanimously iixed the number of 200. They do not desire to put in unsuitable men; they believe that they can find suitable men, and if they cannot find them, they will not suggest unsuitable men for commissions.But there is another condition which seemed to us at Simla essential. Conscription is impossible in India, partly because of the large numbers of the people who are hereditarily conscientious objectors to the taking of life, and partly because you would get into your net such enormous numbers who would be no use to you.   You have, therefore, got to rely on the
orecruiting.efforts,.oil the Indians themselves. Now there are many Indian gentlemen who&apos;would make, in our opinion, good junior ollicers, but who cannot be expected to enlist in the ranks. Their tradition and their civilization would prevent them lighting side by side with their own ryots. We therefore thought that we could get help from large zemindars, young nobles, young princes, if we told them that if they helped us to persuade their ryots and servants to join in the ranks, and if they were willing to come themselves, we should be prepared to train (hem in Gadet Corps in order that they might lake their share, if they were fitted, in leading those whom they helped us to secure. Therefore it was not suggested that all the 200 commissions should be allotted to those who had entered the ranks, but that some should lie reserved for this other category of possible ollicers.The effect upon British ollicers and their supply was carefully considered. It does not seem to me that any British officer should be reluctant, or would be expected to be reluctant, to do his share in the war whatever the conditions, and these are temporary commissions which, will not affect the permanent and future conditions of Indian service. But it is no use shutting our eyes to the fact that this race feeling, which finds itself perhaps at present more drastically expressed in the Army than anywhere else, must vanish, in the future. Suitable Indians must have commissions, and British officers must learn to get accustomed to it. No one voices more strongly than the present Commander-in-Chief in India his belief that men of ail races will not hesitate to follow a capable officer of any race if he is capable, and that is the principle upon which these recommendations are framed.Is it impossible to ask the War Cabinet to reconsider its decision ? 1 cannot see my way to thinking that commissions in the Indian Land Forces would be a satisfactory alternative. The Indian Land Forces are a pure fiction, and commissions in them have been too long regarded as merely honorary. You will never get the whole-hearted assistance of India in the war if you make racial distinctions, and the offer of coin-missions in the Land Forces will merely be regarded as such a distinction, and will be taken to indicate that you cannot, even now when you are calling for help, get over discrimination between Indian and European. I can only say that the refusal of the War Cabinet to the proposal to grant temporary Kings Commissions will have a deplorable result on the war spirit in India. It is a proposal made by the Commander-in-Chief on the full authority of the whole Government of India after discussion and consultation with the Secretary of State, and now emphatically re-asserted. A refusal will lie taken as evidence that when they did their best to respond to the Prime Ministers appeal, their help was not wanted. So . far as I can discover, many educated and thoughtful Indians, of all kinds of political creeds, are a little ashamed of the fact that they have not been able to do more in the war. They are anxious to equip themselves to defend their own country. They are afraid of Mohammedan invasion from the north, with results such as their history has made them familiar with. They are curiously and strenuously afraid of Japan. &quot;Help us to defend ourselves, help us to train ourselves to assist you in defending us,&quot; is a cry which the Viceroy and I received on ail hands. It is a proper-spirit and a right spirit, and it is not only because I was responsible for these recommendations, but because of the effect of refusing, that I would ask the Cabinet to reconsider their decision at an early date.I circulate herewith the telegram of 27th April to the Government of India and their reply. I would myself prefer that there should he no public mention of any number of these temporary commissions. The Commander-in-Chief has given an estimate, and I should like him to be authorised to recommend candidates within this number. The number actually given must depend on the actual supply of fit candidates and the duration of the war.E. S. M.27th May 1918.
APPENDIX.Telegram from Secretary of Stale for India to Viceroy, Army Department,21lh April 1918.Clear the line. Your telegram 51.76 of 22nd. Commissions for Indians. War Cabinet considered your proposals to-day in light of paragraph 4 of your telegram 5242 of 23rd.They agree to following portions of your scheme :-(1) Permanent Commissions. Ten yearly through Sandhurst as in paragraph 1 of my telegram 828. of 5th instant. Also grant of King&apos;s Commissions to maximum of 20 to selected Indian &apos;officers specially distinguished in the war, with proviso as in last pnrt of paragraph 38 of your Despatch 57 of 3rd August. Cabinet wish that the selection of officers should not be confined to those who have served in Trance, but will include all theatres.(2) Honorary Kings Commissions. As in paragraph 2 (c) of your telegram 5.170. it is presumed number you propose as establishment will be tilled up gradually.(3) Your further proposal to grant temporary Kiflg&apos;s Commissions during the war up to maximum of 200 was strongly opposed on following grounds: (i) Effect on recruitment of British officers for the Indian Army wouldbe most harmful. Steps already taken to admit Indians have created distrust among parents and guardians, and a large and sudden measure of this kind might dangerously affect future prospects.(ii) From a military point of view the measure is unnecessary, as Indianofficers with commissions in the native Indian Land Forces possess the same powers, except that of command of British troops, and perform the same duties in the Indian Army as its British officers.(iii) Proposal is inconsistent with opinion and warning of Government ofIndia and Commander-in-Chief expressed in paragraph 40 of your Despatch No. 57 of 3rd August.(iv) The political and temporary results which may be anticipated arenot in military opinion here and at War Office commensurate with damage feared to Indian Army as stated above.(v) The whole scheme for grant of King&apos;s Commissions to Indians shouldbe proceeded with cautiously, and step by step, otherwise risk of disaster is very great. Those who have been most anxious to secure Iving&apos;s Commissions for Indians have always dwelt on necessity for proceeding gradually and with great caution lest whole reform should be prejudiced or destroyed at outset. Large demand now made is in advance of preparations deemed essential to the original scheme.(4) As alternative to your proposal Cabinet is willing to agree to grant of Cadetships in cadre of Native Indian Land Forces up to maximum of 200 during the war, provided you are satisfied that this large number will not be embarrassing after the war owing to impossibility of providing suitable military employment except for a small minority. Those considered suitable after training to be gazetted temporary Second Lieutenants in same cadre and attached to units for regimental duties and best of these may ultimately become eligible for King&apos;s Commissions Indian Army under same proviso as for the 20 above-mentioned and provided they have also qualified them-selves by distinguished service in the field. This presents features which should commend themselves to Indian opinion. . It is a considerable advance44 in associating Indians with commissioned rank and definitely attaching them to units, while providing another doorway to lving&apos;s permanent Commission.(5) Cabinet are prepared to consider any further representations you may wish to make, but in this case they desire that full weight be given to
considerations set forth above. In particular they would desire replies to following questions : (a) Whether Commander-iu-Ohiof considers that Indians of real fighting-capacity and good physique can be raised to the amount mentioned in paragraph.4 of your telegram 5242.(/)) Does Commander-in-Chief consider that the granting of temporary Xing&apos;s Commission up to 200 will, materially influence numbers recruited, or would concession proposed by you appeal more to political than military classes and to be unlikely to promote recruit-ment amongst classes who alone have any military value?(c) Whether ho has considered probability that this large addition ofIndians to King&apos;s Commission is likely to prejudice future recruiting of British officers of best class; and, if so, what is his answer to this objection ?(d) Whether Commander-in-Chief has fully considered effect on IndianArmy for the future if (c) above came to be the case.(6) If you wish question raised again Cabinet desire the considered, opinion of the Commander-in-Chief on all above points, and any further reasons he or your Government may desire to advance for change of view from final lines of paragraph 40 of your Despatch 57 of 3rd August last. Cabinet are prepared to consider full reasons for proposal, but cannot at present assent to this part of your scheme.Telegram from Viceroy, Arm)/ Department, to Secretary of Stale for India,JM May-1918.6545.I. Your telegram of the 27th ultimo, 1030. Commissions for Indians. The following is our reply to your observations. It is arranged under two heads. Part I. which deals with suggestion made in paragraph 4 of your telegram. Part II. which deals with criticisms and questions contained in paragraphs 3, 5, and G.Part I. 2. Commander-in-Chiefs great objection to grant of corn-missions in Native Indian Land forces is that Indians holding such commissions cannot be utilised in Regimental capacity except under conditions which they consider humiliating. As they cannot command British officers or soldiers, an Indian Captain holding commission in Native Indian Land Forces ranks junior for purposes of command to last joined British Second Lieutenant holding King&apos;s commission. Indian Land Force Officer is thus condemned to subordinate position throughout his career, which must destroy his zeal and self-confidence, besides lowering his authority and prestige. It. is for this reason that commissions of this description are so lightly esteemed. Having regard to this serious objection, we cannot admit as correct conclusions arrived at in paragraph 3 of Clause 2 of your telegram.3. Commander-in-Chief recommending grant of temporary King&apos;s corn-missions desired to avoid perpetuation of irritating racial distinction above indicated. We hold that coming after declaration made in House of Commons on 20th August 1917 revival now of moribund native Indian Land Force cadre, except for purpose of granting honorary commissions, would be regarded as device for postponing full pledge then given. We cannot, therefore, accept alternative suggested in paragraph 4 of your telegram.Part II. 4. Success of recruiting depends upon so many factors that Commander-in-Chief cannot guarantee that we shall be able to recruit the half million indicated in our telegram of 23rd ultimo, 5242. Judging from past experience, however, lie thinks that there is reasonable prospect of our being able to secure recruits of suitable physique and good fighting quality xip to number proposed provided we are able to use stimulus of commissionSS0.17 li
given according to our proposals and thai, we are authorised to increase sepoys&apos; emoluments for period of war. On this latter point we will address you separately.5. Owing to great expansion of Army we have been obliged to modify physical standards in certain cases and broaden basis of our recruitment by enlisting new classes as was suggested in your telegram No. 3414 of 13th November 11)10. To judge from reports received by Commander-in-Chief, and his own personal observation, this has been carried out judiciously and without lowering fighting value of Army. Some classes have not come up to expectation, but general results have been satisfactory.b. In recommending grant of temporary Iving&apos;s Commissions, Com-mander-in-Chief had in view desirability of recognising services to recruiting rendered by men of influence more especially in Frontier Province, Punjab, Northern India and certain Native States. It is on gentlemen of this class, who nearly all belong to fighting races, that we rely for the further assistance needed to recruit large additional numbers required. Desire for commissions is keen and has full support of 0&apos;Dwyer, Bikaner, Sindhia, Patiala and others who have identified themselves with development of India&apos;s man-power. Desire is not inspired by political agitators, but represents legitimate aspirations of a class which is conscious of having rendered important service to Empire and is now anxious to prove its loyalty by further efforts.7. Immediate grant of 200 temporary King&apos;s commissions such as was contemplated. This total was suggested as representing maximum likely to be required, during war. It was to have been worked up to gradually, recipients being selected with greatest care and output limited to about 50 every six months.8. Commander-in-Chief has realised all along that grant of commissions to Indians might be regarded with disfavour by parents and guardians at home. This risk, however, was faced by us when at your predecessor&apos;s request we formulated proposals made in our Despatch No. 57, dated 3rd August 1.917, and was : accepted by you when you announced in House of Commons on 20th August 1917 removal of bar which had hitherto precluded admission of Indians to commissioned rank.0. Importance of not going too fast in this matter is fully appreciated by Commander-in-Chief. For this reason instead of suggesting bestowal oil Indians of large number of permanent King&apos;s commissions which might have justified distrust of English parents he deliberately advocated more cautious policy of granting temporary commissions. Moreover, the fact that additional commissions proposed were to be temporary not only gave guarantee that number permanently appointed would be carefully regulated, but provided means of eliminating all officers who failed to attain professional standard demanded or who proved themselves otherwise unfit.10. Commander-in-Chief attaches great importance to British officers of Indian Army being recruited from same class as heretofore. The war has made great inroads on this class, extent of which cannot at present be estimated. This factor, however, is one which will affect post helium officering of army as a whole and not of Indian Army in particular.11. Commander-in-Chiefs views as expressed above have our full cou-currence. We adhere to the opinions expressed in paragraphs 3, 4, 25 and 40 of- our Despatch No. 57, dated 3rd August 1917, as to importance of moving slowly in the matter of permanent commissions, and we entirely, agree that hasty and ill-considered action might prove disastrous. We cannot admit, however, that grant of temporary commissions on scale, suggested in.paragraph 7 would entail any material departure from cautious policy advocated in our Despatch. Special situations demand special measures, and if India is to contribute to man-power of Empire on scale contemplated in Prime Ministers message, number of commissions granted to Indians should bear reasonable proportion to number of men to be recruited.
12. We feel confident that disinclination of War Cabinet to accept our proposal was due primarily to the difficulty of stating within narrow compass of a telegram our reasons for recommendations submitted. We repeat that arguments in favour of our proposals stand now in stronger prominence than when we originally submitted them. Experience during war has taught us that among influential Indians there are many unemployed anxious to serve the Empire and set an example of personal service to those who look to them as their leaders. Owing to family tradition, however, they feel they cannot do so and at the same time uphold their prestige except as ollicers holding King&apos;s commission.13. It is most important that we should retain goodwill of this class, and that their power should be utilised to fullest extent in interests of recruiting, and we are assured that a position in Army with prospect of securing permanent commissions in case of those found suitable will best effect this object.14. In conclusion, we would remark that we are now actively engaged in doing all that is possible to promote recruiting throughout India, and that should War Cabinet feel themselves able to accept proposals made in paragraph 7 of this telegram no greater encouragement could be given to martial classes, and no greater stimulus provided to arouse zeal and activity in getting expansion of man-power. On the other hand, we must state frankly that rejection of proposals will add very materially to the difficulty of raising greatly increased quota of recruits we desire to furnish.
