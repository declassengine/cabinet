(iG.T.4635Homo, &quot;by the Rt._Hon._G, 11. Barnes, ivi.P. -Ml% Austin Ch^mberl^inis memorandum o-r* Ireland (G.T.. 4626) hn?3 caused&quot; me some misgivings, huj; 1 feel it to be necessary to siwlre my position on the Irish Question quite cle*r to my coll-e-igves.   Whilst X -varee with Iir*. Chamberlain tint the discovery of *n extensive&apos; conspiracy with ^ovmn &apos; affiliation ins-anteri^lly altered the Irish situation, nnd whilst I:&apos;..*ccept his view tint the-enforcement of conscription And the passing of n Home. Rule Act Ins been postponed (but not ^b^ndoned), I wish win to nnke it quite cle^r tint J *m not in favour of the application of conscription without&quot; Home Rule. ;I do not slnre lir.Chamberlciin&apos;s fe*rs tint the l*st hope of effecting a settlement of Irish difficulties any disappear if the Government fail to tnlre up the challenge of the&apos; Sinn Seiners And the Nationalists *s regards the enforcement of conscription.-The &quot;challenge&quot; which we took up,in August 1914 is my 3Gle concern; and I don&apos;t see how conscription in Ireland is to help us in decline; more effectively with th*t challenge.If voluntary recruiting f^ils to secure the success for which we hope, tint failure doe? not seem to me a sufficient justi-flection for ^b^ndoning -ill efforts &apos;*t settling the Irish difficulty by concilifltory methods.   Tint would be tho Inevitable result of enforcing conscription without first passing a generous meisu/^e of Home Rule; ind to tint course X c*n never, in my circumstances give my approval. .-  &apos;.&apos;(SIGHED) G* IT, BAJftlES.2,Whitehall Gardens,S.W.124th,M^y 1918.
