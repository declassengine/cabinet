The later pilots observed a firo burning in the station at the North end of THION-VILLE on approach.    This was evidently caused by the first pilots to reach the objective.    A cluster of lights were observed near PAGNY, but thero was nothing to Indicate this being an aerodrome, and the majority of pilots are of the opinion that it is not one.
