THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 19 (35).CABINET.MATERIAL  FOR  IMPENDING  DISCUSSIONS   WITH  french ministers.(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.)(The information in this note is based on CP. 6 (35) as amended by the Cabinet at their meeting held on January 10, 1935 (Cabinet 3 (35), Conclusion 1.)THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a Memorandum to the Cabinet (CP. 6 (35)), dated the 9th January, 1935, submitted a series of propositions for Cabinet authorisation which contained the essential suggestions in CP. 302 (34). The Cabinet, at their meeting held on the 14th January, 1935 (Cabinet 3 (35), conclusion 1), approved paragraphs 2-7 of CP. 6 (35), and also recorded certain conclusions on the subject of general security and possible British contributions thereto. The material in the form approved by the Cabinet for the impending discussions with French Ministers is contained in the ensuing paragraphs, numbers 2-7 of which contain the substance of CP. 6 (35) in the form attached as an Appendix to Cabinet 3 (35).2. It will be agreed, in. the first place, that this is not a case for hard and fast instructions, and that a good deal of flexibility must be allowed to Ministers conducting the discussions. We can only speculate as to the line which our French visitors are likely to wish to follow, and, if new matters of great importance emerge, it will, of course, always be possible to discuss them on the basis that final decisions must be reserved for the Cabinet as a whole.3. We shall naturally begin with some reference to Sir John Simon&apos;s interview of the 22nd December and to the Franco-Italian agreement reached at Rome. As regards the former, it will be useful to note that French Ministers have recognised that the position taken up in the French note of the 17th April can no longer be maintained. We shall have to point out that, in the interval, Germany has not stood still, and that it is therefore to be expected that any proposal for recognising the existing limit of armaments reached in Germany will involve something more than was contained in the German document of the 16th April.4. The relevant passage in the Franco-Italian agreements reached at Rome is to the following effect :- -The Italian and French Governments, referring to the Declaration of Equality of Rights of the 11th December, 1932, have found themselves in agreement in their recognition that no country can modify by unilateral act-its obligations in the matter of armaments, and that in the case of this eventuality being established they should consult each other.We should inform the French Government that we had already taken up with the German Government a similar attitude, though we had not previously published the fact. After: the House of Commons&apos; Debate of the 28th November, 1934, and our communication to the German Government as to our information, on German rearmament, we felt bound to make it clear to the German Govern-[11046]
ment that they must not assume that.we considered the Disarmament,Glauses of Part V as no longer binding. We therefore told;  hem that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not recognise the right of any signatory to - a Treaty to free&apos; itself from the obligations imposed upon it without negotiation and agreement with the other signatories.5. After these preliminaries, our main line with French Ministers must be that it is worse than useless to allow the existing situation to drift. Germany is, in fact, increasing her armaments, and the facts must be faced and dealt with in the only practicable way. It is impracticable to expect Germany to scrap what she is in process of building up in regard to armaments in order that a fresh start might be made in a new agreement. We must deal with the German situation as it is to-day, bearing in mind that the return of Germany to the League and to the Disarmament Conference is essential for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe. We should put forward the view that, while we do not in any way condone Germany&apos;s action in leaving the League, we can conceive of no real basis for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe so long as Germany remains outside. We do not question the illegality of Germany&apos;s rearmament in breach of the Treaty, but the stage has been reached when its recognition has become inevitable. We should press strongly the point that it is far better that this rearmament should be controlled than that it should remain uncontrolled. To the objection which the French may raise that this concession amounts to condoning illegality and surrendering to what they may describe as blackmail, we should ask the French Ministers whether they have a practicable alternative. We should point out that Germany has already demanded, and will continue to demand, equality of rights. It may be that she will not be content with the idea of the status quo as far as she is concerned. But we should seek a basis for negotiation which would recognise nothing beyond what has already been done. A further increase in Germany&apos;s arms strength necessarily raises new questions as to the security of others. If the French raise the question of action under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, we should point out that it would appear extremely unlikely that this article could be enforced. On the other hand, if we can once get a new basis for negotiation and a prospect of agreement, Germany might be expected to take up a different attitude to a system of inspection or to a system of supervision agreed to as part of a convention about armaments, provided that it is of general application to all countries.(The contents of this paragraph are in effect a summary taken from paragraph 3 of CP, 302 (34) to which the Cabinet gave approval on the 9th January, 1935.)6. French Ministers may certainly be expected, in reply to the above, to raise the question of &quot; security &quot; and to insist that the agreement of France to equality of rights was conditioned, by the terms of the document of the 11th December, 1932, by the phrase &quot; in a system which would provide security for all nations.&quot; We must therefore expect to be asked what proposals we have to make to satisfy this condition. Again, we must expect to have placed before us by French Ministers proposals of their own on this subject.7. On the topic of security we should first emphasise that the accommodation which we are seeking to bring about with Germany is not designed specially for our benefit and not advocated from any willingness to prejudice the French position. Our conviction is that such an accommodation is needed in the general interests of Europe and is just as much essential to the position of France as to anyone else. We are not asking France to make sacrifices in our interest for which some special compensation is required, any more than our recent contri-bution of troops to police the Saar was specially in the interests of France and called for a quid pro quo. In both cases it is the general pacification of Europe which is in question, and in that matter we are all equally interested. The longer we all hesitate to take the bold action which is now so urgently called for, the worse the situation will get for all of us and the less chance there will be of getting a contribution towards agreement from Germany. Moreover, we have announced a programme of rearmament, especially in the air, and are therefore already burdening ourselves with what amounts to a more material contribution from which the Locarno&apos;Powers gain advantage:
8. On this subject of general security and the possible British contributions thereto, the British representatives should be authorised (subject to a good deal of flexibility being allowed to them in the conduct of the discussions) to proceed, in so far as circumstances render this necessary and desirable, on the following lines : (a) That, as a counter to French demands for a contribution on our parttowards general security and in return for some important advance on the part of French Ministers, the British representatives might consent to accept inspection and supervision of armaments as part of any scheme of disarmament that might result from the present negotiations. This great concession, however, should not be made too readily or without emphasising that it involves the surrender of a principle to which we attach the greatest importance.(b) That, since we had already indicated general approval to the RomeAgreement, we could undertake to support the French in any way we could to bring about the adherence of Germany to the proposed multi-lateral non-interference pact in Central Europe agreed upon at Rome.(c) That we could support the French effort, to which we were already committed, to secure the adherence of Germany and Poland to the proposed Eastern Pact, but that the British negotiators should not allow themselves to be persuaded that this was an essential part of the negotiations with Germany.(d) That an expression could be made of our readiness in principle tosupport a proposal, if advanced by French Ministers, that Germany should be pressed to conclude non-aggression pacts with her neighbours in accordance with the offer made by Herr Hitler last year.(e) That no attempt should be made for a redefinition of our obligations under Locarno. If the French Ministers should make proposals to &quot; put teeth into Locarno,&quot; the British negotiators should make it clear that it was necessary to carry British public opinion, and that from this point of view it was necessary to avoid any actual reference to that Treaty. They would prefer to deal with the question from the point of view of our own vital interests, and to link up any further declaration to the public declaration we had already made as to the importance of Belgium from the point of view of British security. This, however, would also inure to the benefit of France. (/) That the negotiators should avoid a statement that Great Britain considers the demilitarisation of the Rhineland as a vital interest. If French Ministers should raise the question of the demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the British negotiators should be authorised to state that we were bound by the Locarno Treaty and had no intention of repudiating it.(g) That the British negotiators should be authorised, if they found it necessary and desirable, to make a declaration to the effect that Great Britain would consider any attempt to interfere with the independence or integrity of Belgium as dangerous to her peace and security. The question of including Holland should not be raised by British Ministers at the conversations.9. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris has been asked to find means to let the French Government know that it would be preferable that the question of regular consultations between the General Staffs of Great Britain, France and Belgium should be strictly avoided at the forthcoming meeting. Such consulta-tions would be inconsistent with our present policy of bringing the Germans back to Geneva; and our public opinion is not yet ripe for the Government to agree to their taking place. In these circumstances, a French proposal for such consultations would be quite premature at present; and we should be obliged to resist the suggestion at once.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 24, 1935.
