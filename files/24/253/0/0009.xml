THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 9 (35).CABINET.ANGLO-JAPANESE RELATIONS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.THE Cabinet may like to read the accompanying letter from Mr. Guy Locock, the Director of the Federation of British Industries, written on behalf of the Mission sent by the Federation to Japan and Manchukuo. That Mission (consisting of Lord Barnby, Sir Charles Seligman, Mr. Julian Piggott and Mr. Locock) have published a Report dealing with the commercial and industrial questions examined during their visit. The present letter (which is confidential) records certain general impressions formed on subjects outside the scope of the Mission as such. Although Lord Barnby and his colleagues were in Japan and Manchukuo for only a few weeks, they had unique opportunities to meet leading men in the two countries, and their impressions are worth noting.The Mission hold very strongly the view that Japan is bound to be the dominating force in the Far East; they believe that (realising that a forma] alliance is impracticable, at any rate for the moment) Japan desires an understanding with us an understanding which might begin by co-operation as regards China.I understand that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is circulating separately a despatch* from Sir R. Clive, dated the 10th November, covering a recent memorandum by His Majesty&apos;s Commercial Counsellor at Tokyo on Anglo-Japanese economic and political relations.W. R.Board of Trade, January 4, 1935.Federation of British Industries.(Confidential.)Dear Sir Horace; December 10, 1934.As you are aware, the Report of the Mission sent by the Federation of British Industries to Japan and Manchoukuo is shortly to be published. The Report deals entirely with the industrial questions which were studied by the Mission during its tour.The Mission is now dissolved, but, as a group of Englishmen to whom somewhat unique opportunities were given to study general conditions in Japan and Manchoukuo, we feel it is possible that you might wish to have an idea of certain general impressions we formed on subjects outside the scope of our Mission. I have been asked, therefore, by my colleagues of the Mission to write you this confidential letter, containing our personal views, for any use which you may care to make of it.The dominant impression which we carried away from the Far East was the important role which Japan is now playing in that part of the world, and which, in our opinion, she Will increasingly play in future.On the material side, we were greatly struck by the efficiency of industry, communications, and every branch of national activity. Our visit to Osaka and Kobe happened to coincide with the mobilisation there of the entire Japanese* CP. 8 (35).[11012] &apos;
fleet, and a review of its Air Force. This evidence of the physical power at the disposal of Japan could not fail to impress anyone who saw it.Equally impressive is the national spirit which is to-day so evident in Japan. It is based upon loyalty to the Throne and a feeling of service to the country. From early youth every Japanese school child is trained in reverence to the Throne, in respect for religion, and in duty to the country. In our opinion there is no doubt that the Japanese nation can be counted upon to act as one man when questions of national interest or honour are involved.Japan undoubtedly feels that it is essentially her mission to solve the problems of the Far East. The question appears to us to be whether she is going to attempt to do this alone, with results the consequences of which no one can foresee, or whether she is prepared to work in co-operation with this country. We feel that, from every point of view, such as the security of our position in the Far East, our trade relations in China and elsewhere, or a solution of the problem of Anglo-Japanese trade competition, an understanding between the two countries is essential.We believe that Japan recognises that anything in the nature of a formal alliance is impossible. We feel, however, that she is seriously perturbed by the fact of her isolation, and that the prospect of friendly co-operation with Great Britain is what she most desires. In view of the unique position of the Emperor of Japan,we think it important to place on record that at the audience which he granted to the Mission he expressed to each of us individually his hope that we would take back to Great Britain a message of friendship from his country.The greatest guarantee of the peace of the Far East appears to us to lie in an improvement of the relations between Japan and China. We suggest that Great Britain, by establishing friendly relations with Japan and thus being in a position to exercise a restraining influence, might play a great part in bringing this about. Any common policy towards China would have to be based upon the policy of the open door, and should not therefore be contrary to the interests of any country, including America. Furthermore, it would have to be such as to prove to China that a genuine attempt was being made to help her out of her present difficulties. We cannot attach too much importance to this question of Sino-Japanese relations and the necessity of an understanding between Japan and Great Britain on the policy which is to* be adopted in China.With regard to Manchoukuo, the Japanese fully realise the present difficulties in the way of asry recognition of the State by Great Britain. Japanese opinion is that,the question of recognition of the new State will be most readily solved by means of a direct agreement between China and Japan by some method which will allow the former country to save face. We feel that there is much force in this view.Although there is a definite Manchou Government established at Hsinking, there is no doubt that the real power rests in the hands of the Japanese advisers and military and will continue to do so. We do not consider that Japan aims at annexation. We think the motive which prompted her to extend her influence to Manchoukuo was chiefly the desire for the creation of a strong buffer State against Soviet Russia and the spread of Communist ideas throughout the Far East. Leaving out the question, of the legality of her past action, the practical effect cannot in our opinion fail to be of advantage to China as well as to herself. Another reason was that J apan looks to Manchoukuo to become a supplier of raw materials and foodstuffs and an important outlet for her manufactured products. Japanese immigration on a large scale is at present improbable.We feel bound to . record our opinion that the Chinese inhabitants of Manchoukuo are undoubtedly far better off under the present regime than they were before. They now enjoy a sound currency, reasonable taxation, freedom from military exactions, and an increasing degree of law and order. Under Japanese guidance Manchoukuo is being transformed into a modern State. Communications are being developed. The amenities of Western life are being introduced. Although difficulties still lie ahead of Manchoukuo, we consider that they will be overcome and that a gradually increasing level of prosperity may be anticipated.We should like to emphasise that the solution of our trade difficulties with Japan, and the extent to which British industry will be given opportunities to participate in the development of Manchoukuo, will in our opinion depend very largely upon whether the political relations between Japan and Great Britain can be placed upon a basis of friendly co-operation.
There is one further point which we should like to stress, namely, the desirability of some closer form of personal contact between the local British representatives and the Japanese authorities in Manchoukuo. It is fully realised that the existing status of non-recognition makes it difficult for our representa-tives to maintain close contact with the authorities in Manchoukuo, but it should not be forgotten that it is possible to establish personal and friendly relations with the Japanese advisers or with the staff of the Japanese Embassy at Hsinking without coming into contact with the actual Cabinet Ministers of the Manchoukuo Government, who are exclusively Chinese or Manchous. The Japanese readily admit the difficulty of recognition, but suggest that closer personal contact with themselves would result in matters being more frankly and satisfactorily discussed in private conversation.It was very noticeable throughout our tour that the confidence arising from personal contact with the J apanese, when once established, is of tremendous value in the discussion of any problem.Yours sincerely, (Sd.)        GUY LOCOCK.Sir Horace Wilson, G.C.M.G., K.C.B.. C.B.E., Board of Trade.
