COMMITTEE ON INDIA. !--&apos;---------------------REPORT ON DRAFT GOVERNMENT OF INDIA BILL.1.    At their&quot; Meeting on the 5th December, 1934, the Cabinet took note of the fact that it was contemplated that the draft Government of India Bill would be examined by the Cabinet Committee on India in January, 1935, with a view to Its being published not later than the 22nd of that month,&apos;     They accordingly agreed that the Bill should be approved by the Cabinet on or about the 17th January, and that in all the circumstances consideration of the draft Bill by the Home Affairs Committee might properly be dispensed with (Cabinet 45 (34) Conclusion 7).2.    The Committee at their Meeting on the 9th January had under consideration a draft of the Government of India Bill, which had been circulated on the 3rd January under cover of a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.      The Secretary of State for India outlined to the Committee the main principles which had been adopted in the drafting of the Bill;    he. explained that the Bill followed the recommendations contained in the Report of the Joint Select Committee, subject to a few modifica-tions of detail, only two of which were of any importance (a) the procedure in relation to the confirmation by parliament of the Instruments of Instruction to the Governor General and to the Provincial Governors, and (b) the limitation of the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court to matters arising out of the interpretation of the Constitution Act.COPY NO. 4-C?

9QThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment.SECRET. c&apos;pv No,.L,5.,C A B I M E T.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA BILL.iEXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR INDIA.I circulate to my colleagues for approval the draft Government of .India Bill, together with the report of the Cabinet-.: Committee upon it.    Since the Committee reported I have, as agreed with them, made various drafting changes,    none of which involve any alteration of substance.2.    The Bill is so drawn as to give effect, In accordance with the resolutions of. both Houses of Parliament, to the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee.    On a few points I have thought it necessary in some cases to vary, and in others to supplement, the recommendations of the Committee, but, with one exception, these variations are on points of detail of insignificant importance. The only variation which is of any importance is the reversion to the proposals of the White Paper in relation to the extent of the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court, which in the Bill (clauses 181 and 183),  as proposed   in the White Paper, is..confined to cases raising issues as to the interpretation of the Constitution Act.    The Committee, recommended that, in addition to such cases, the FederalCopy No.9-
Court should- also entertain appeals from the High Courts of States and Provinces on matters involving the interpretation of Acts passed by the Federal Legislature.    The Government of India are opposed to this proposal, partly on grounds of principle, since there is, in fact, no really logical ground for defining the range of ordinary civil appeals on the basis of Acts passed by a particular Legislature, but chiefly because they anticipate that the States would maintain the strong objection they have always felt to any appellate jurisdiction affecting their Courts which gees beyond the interpretation of the Constitution Act. They insist, therefore, that a provision of this kind&apos; would definitely tend to discourage accessions.3.    It will be at once observed that the great length of the Bill is mainly due to the fact that the general.provisions relating to the Central Executive and Legislature in Part II have to be repeated in the same form, and very often in almost identical   terms in relation to the Executives and Legislatures first of the Indian Provinces and secondly of Burma.    This repetition is inevitable in the case of Burma, since it is intended that at some stage Part XIII relating to Burma, which is self-contained, should reach the Statute Book as a separate Act.    I am satisfied that there is no feasible method of avoiding the repetitions in the Indian Part of the Bill otherwise than by a method of enactment by reference which would, without cioubt, result in a most confused and unintelligible presentation.4.   Without attempting to explain now in detail the construction of the Bill, I think it well to point out
one technical device running throughout the Bill -which has to he understood in order that the effects ^of various provisions may &quot;be fully appreciated.    The expression &quot;in his discretion&quot; or &quot;acting in his discretion&quot; is used in relation to the Governor-General (and Governors) in respect of those matters in which their Ministers have, under the Bill, no legal right to tender advice:    the expression &quot;in. his individual judgment&quot; or &quot;exorcising an individual judgment&apos;1 is used similarly in relation to those matters which, although   they fall within the sphere of Ministers, and Ministers have, therefore, a legal and constitutional right to tender advice in respect of them, yet the Governor-General (or a Governor) is free to act otherwise than in accordance with that advice.    It follows the,!, wherever the word &quot;Governor-General&quot; (or &quot;Governor&quot;) or the expression &quot;Federal Government&quot; (or &quot;Provincial Government&quot;) or &quot;the functions of the Governor-General&quot; (of the Governor) are used., without the qualification &quot;in his discretion&quot; or &quot;In his individual judgment&quot; the meaning is, in effect, the Governor-General (or Governor) acting;, on the advice of Ministers.5.    The only other point in the construction of the Bill to which I think I need draw attention is the provisions in clause 124(3) and (4), which, read with the Governor&apos;s special responsibility indicated as paragraph (g) in clause 53(l), are designed to give the Governor-General, to the extent stated in clause 124(1) and (2), power to secure that such action is taken in the Provinces as will enable the Governor-General    effectively to discharge his own special
responsibilities, both for the Reserved Subjects and otherwise.6.    It will be readily understood, that the Instrument of Instructions to be issued to the Governor-General and. Governors will play a large part in the working of the Constitution, and. that the exact effect of various provisions in the Bill cannot be fully gauged except in the light of this document.    The actual drafts of the Instruments of Instruction cannot, of course, be formally submitted to Parliament for approval until after the Bill is pa,ssed, but I intend to have a provisional draft ready for circulation to Parliament as a white Paper before the Bill comes under discussion in Committee, so that the discussion of the Bill may he entered upon in the light of that indication of the contents of this important supplementary document.7.    It will be observed, that the Bill as printed has no Preamble.    It has been strongly impressed upon me by the Government of India that the enactment of this Act without a Preamble, and the simultaneous repeal of the present Government of India Act, together with the Montagu-CheIrnsford Act of 1919, will be taken in India as meaning the cancellation of the well-known declaration of policy in the Preamble to the Act of 1919.    My colleagues of the Cabinet Committee were, on the whole,   ^ inclined, to favour the insertion of a short preamble which would have the effect of reaffirming the policy indicated in the 1919 Preamble, and,, although undoubted difficulties may arise from this course, I have consulted the Viceroy on. the subject, and will circulate a further memorandum in the course of the day..
