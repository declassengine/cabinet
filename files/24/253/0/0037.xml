THISDOCUMENTt c!THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT.^57 (55) iCOPY NO. J-j^CABINSrrtON RIBBON DEVELOPMENT.REPORT.1. Ait t heir Meeting on the 6th February, 1935, (Cabinet S (35) Conclusion 11) the Cabinet agreed-That a Cabinet Committee composed as followst-The Secretary of State for the Colonies(In the Chair), The Chancellor of the Exchequer (or representative), The Secretary of State for War, The Secretary of State for Scotland, The Minister of Health, The Minister of Labour, and The Minister of transport should meet immediately to consider the question of &quot;ribbon&quot; development along roads and to make recommendations as to how the question can best be dealt with.2.      The Committee at the commencement of their discussions had before them the proposals submitted to the Cabinet by the Minister of Transport in his Memorandum of the 1st February, 1935, (CP. 31 (35)), and were also furnished with a draft of a Bill giving effect to these proposals.      The Minister&apos;s proposalscontemplated that two lines should be drawn, 200 feet from the boundary of the road and up to 80 feet from the middle of the road respectively.     Within the first of these the proposal was that powers should be conferred on highway authorities on the lines of those already obtained under Private Acts by Surrey, Middlesex and. Essex.     Within the second belt a highway authority, or in default the Minister of Transport, would have
rpower to prevent any new &quot;building or development 5    210 compensation being payable except where restrictions would make economic development impossible.3, We have considered the scope and effect of the powers which have been taken in the private Acts and the recommendations made by the County Councils Association. It is clear that there are two aspects of ribbon development,   safety and amenity.      We are convinced that in any Bill which the Government introduce we must deal with both, aspects.      We have endeavoured to do so j    and we are satisfied after a full review of the problem and all the difficulties administrative and financial that the proposals we now make, while they afford no complete guarantee against ribbon development, are practicable, and go as far as it is possible to do, without cutting across the whole structure of town-planning organisation.      If this problem had been taken in hand years ago before great new roads had been constructed, a more comprehensive and complete solution might have been propounded?    and. this is still within our power where new roads are constructed in future.     But the problem is most acute, where it is most difficult of solution, namely the existing roads. The proposals we now submit cover both.
Existing Roads,4.      The Committee&apos;s proposals as regards existing roads are that for the purposes of the restrictions to &quot;be described below two lines should, be prescribed along and parallel to all existing roads to which the legislation would applys    (a) an Amenity Building Line 220 feet from, the middle of the roadj    and (b) a road Improvement Line, within the Amenity Building Line, the80 feet and would be governed distance of which from the middle of the road would not exceed /by a schedule of standard widths of road, to be annexed to theBill.      A draft of the proposed schedule is annexed as Appendix Ato this Report, and an illustrative diagram as Appendix B.5,      The construction of any building or new means of access within the Amenity Building Line (220 feet) should, we propose, only be allowed in future with the consent of the appropriate high way   authority, which Consent might be given    subject to conditions We further recommend that highway authorities should exercise their powers of restricting both building and access in a reasonable manner, and that there should be an appeal from their decisions to the Minister of Transport, who would act in consultation with the Minister of Health.we consider that this power of control should go far to prevent ribbon development not only within 220 feet of the road, but also beyond this line,  since it would make it more costly and inconvenient to bring sewers, lightingand other services to the main road across so wide a belt.      The Committee discussed the possibility of placing in the hands of highway   authorities a more extensive control over the area beyond the Amenity Building Line j    but it was felt that such an
*U Q ^0 rj (0extension of the scope of the legislation was impracticable,-and that it would give rise to difficult questions ef over-lapping of responsibility between local authorities.      Moreover, the arrangement we recommend has already worked well under the somewhat analogous procedure provided for in the private legislation of the Surrey and Essex County Councils.It is proposed that the restrictions in respect of building in and access through the Amenity Building Line  should come into force as regards classified roads as from an appointed day and as regards other roads upon the Minister&apos;s confirmation of a duly advertised resolution of the local highway authority.The extent to which the authorities concerned will avail themselves of the powers proposed will,  no doubt, vary and will depend to a large extent on the keenness and financial capacity of individual authorities.    The possibility of making favourable agreements with property owners will be an important consider-ation.6. &quot;      The fixing of an interior line,  the Road Improvement Line, would,  on the other hand, primarily have regard to the traffic side of the problem.    It is very necessary to provide for the width of road which may eventually be required for the safe and adequate passage of traffic,  and to prevent development taking place within this width so as to avoid large claims for compen-sation at a later date.    No development of any kind,  other than agricultural, would accordingly be permitted within the Road Improvement Line, without the consent of the highway authority.New buildings and additions to  existing buildings within the Road Improvement Line could, we think, be permitted with  the consent of the highway authority,provided that the ewner entered into an undertaking with the authority that he would not claim compensation for the new building in question if the land was ultimately taken over for road purposes.      We anticipate-A-
that in practice this will prove to he an effective deterrent -to any serious degree of development.It is proposed to secure this interior line by empowering highway authorities to make orders adopting the appropriate standard width for any road within their responsibility, these arders not to be effective until&apos;confirmed by the Minister of Transport with or without modification.7.      The Committee recommend that power should also be given tothe Minister in cases where a highway authority has not takenappropriate action to make an order enforcing the specifiedwidth in respect of any classified road, or after public enquiry in respect of an unclassified read.      Whilst the committee consider that an over-riding power of this kind would be essentialto secure requisite uniformity, some of us feel that considerable,and not unreasonable,  opposition may be aroused if the minister in opposition to the wishes af the Highway Autherity is able to exercise this power/even in the case of a classifiedroad without a public enquiry.      We, therefore, desire to leave to the Cabinet the final decision on the question whether a public enquiry should not be requisite in all cases in which the Minister exercises his over-riding power.      We are all in any case agreed that,  in the event of Parliamentary pressure developing on this point, a modification could be accepted during the passage of the Bill providing for a public enquiry in every case in which the Minister proposes to exercise his over-riding-power.8.      Compensation, under the proposals we are recommending, 1 -vwould, we consider, be Involved in respect of property (a) within the Road Improvement Line   and (b) within the Amenity Building Line.We recommend that in every case compensation should be assessed on the basis of proved injurious affection alone, with
the, clearest possible directions to the arbitrator to securethat he should take into account any benefit which may accrue to the owner by reason of the construction or improvement ofthe road, including the construction of a. service road, andalso by reason of any restrictions imposed on adjacent property,and further that he should disregard any increase in the claimto compensation due to transfer of rights after the coming intoforce of the restrictions.we further recommend that compensation in respect ofinjurious affection should not be paid until the owner is actually prevented from developing his land in such a manner as he could and. would have done but for the restriction.      thus the mere coming into force of the restrictions within the RoadImprovement Line and the Amenity Building Line respectively wouldnot of themselves give rise to compensation until proved Injuriousaffection has actually taken place.Subject to the above, the provisions of the Bill would for acquisition of land, follow the accepted principles in relation to compensation/ andwould thus make adequate provision for cases of &quot;severance&quot;,where by reason of the extent or shape of the land left in theunrestricted possession of an owner its value for buildingpurposes was more than proportionately diminished.9.      We   recommend that contributions should be made from the Road Fund in respect of compensation to be paid by highway authorities for injurious affection of land within the Road Improvement Line.      Compensation becoming payable in respect of land within or beyond the Amenity Building Line would not attract such grants.10.    We have given considerable attention to the question of the scope of application of these proposals.      Some of us have felt that the restrictions should,  if possible, be confined to the more important main roads of the country.     We understand, however,
that there is a widespread reeling among local authorities and others that harm would be caused if the legislation were limited in this way, since it might have the result of driving bad development to other roads not subject to the restrictions,     We are advised that the Bill should extend to all classified roads and such other roads as may be declared to be subject to the restrictions by the appropriate highway authority, with the approval of the Minister.     We recommend that this course should be adopted.Ho    A further point for consideration has been the division as between the local authorities in any given area of responsibility for the exercise of the powers proposed.     Along with responsibility for the exercise of the powers would be responsibility for payment of compensation.      Where the restrictions are primarily imposed with a view to solving the traffic aspect of the problem as in the case of the area within the Road Improvement Line (standard width), the appropriate local authority would clearly be the highway authority in the area concerned.      On the other hand, in the belt between the Road Improvement Line and the Amenity Building Line, where the restrictions have primarily the object of preserving amenities, it would be of necessity that full regard should be paid to the views of the local authority in whom town planning powers have been or might be vested, and provision  must   be made for consultation between the two local authorities concerned.New Roads.IS,   As stated above,  the Committee recommend that special provisions should be inserted in the legislation in respect of new roads.      We consider that the powers of the appropriate high-way     authorities should, as regards any new roads, be the same as those proposed in the case of existing roads;   but we do not
feel that the same case for compensation exists as the property involved is likely to have little or no building value prior to the construction of the new road.      The majority of us consider, therefore, that with a view to facilitating as far as possible the exercise by highway     authorities of the powers proposed for dealing with the danger of ribbon development along new roads, it should be provided that no claim for compensation should be admitted, arising out of the restrictions imposed, on the principle that betterment accruing to owners of property along-side the new road should be regarded as roughly equivalent to any loss they might claim to suffer as a result of the restrictions - we have proposed in the interests of orderly development.      Local highway authorities would, of course, continue to pay for the land taken for the purposes of the road itself, and we propose that compensation should be paid as at present in cases where special loss arose due to &quot;severance&quot;. The majority of the Committee believe that such a proposal will be regarded by public opinion as desirable and reasonable in the case of new roads, We would only add that we are advised that new roads are likely to form a small part only of the problem, as compared with existing roads.Sub s i d i ary C1ans e s,13,    The Committee recommend that, as subsidiary to the above proposals, provision should also be made in the proposed legislation for giving all highway authorities the cowers nowpossessed by the Middlesex County Council to purchase landwithin 220 yards from the centre of any road within their area for the purposes of preserving amenitiesi    and for enablinglocal authorities to provide garages and to require the provisionof garage  or partial acconrooda11 on in connection with new buildings likely to attract a large amount of traffic.Trunk Roads.14,   Proposals have also been laid before the Committee for the
transfer to the Ministry of Transport of full responsibility for about 4000 miles of the main trunk roads of the&apos; country as the best means of dealing with ribbon development and other grave traffic problems. We feel that at present no final decision on this important problem can be takenj    but in the course of our discussions we considered the possibility of an announcement being made,  in connection with the introduction of the legislation now proposed,  that the Government had other and. wider proposals in mind in connection with trunk roads. We do not, however, recommend this course;   we feel that such an announcement could not appropriately be made in connection with a measure designed to deal with ribbon development, and further that it might discourage local authorities from making the full use of the powers which we now recommend should be granted, thus endangering the effectiveness of the legislation we propose 9 and would obscure the intrinsic merits of the proposal.Miscellaneous.15.    We are advised that our proposals outlined above could with minor modifications be extended to Scotland.16.    We recommend that the Ministers concerned should be authorised to discuss the Bill with representatives of the Local Authorities before it is introduced.17.    We are indebted to Officers of the Departments and to the Chief Valuer for much detailed work in connection with these proposals.
Summary cf Conclusions.18,We recommend to the CabinetThat in fulfilment of the promise of immediate legislation on the subject of ribbon development a Bill should be prepared and introduced fqrihwlth embodying the following features:(&quot;-0 An Amenity Building Line should be laid down? in the manner proposed above3  220 feet from the middle of all roads to which the Bill applies;    within this line no building development or new means of access should be allowed without the consent of the appropriate highway authority.(2) The Bill should provide that highway authorities - should exercise their powers reasonably? and that  there  should be an appeal to the Minister of Transportj who would then act in consult-ation with the Minister of Health.&apos;( 3) A n i hi:, erior Roa be laid down ind.....mentLine should alsoaccordance with&quot;&quot;appropriatestandard widths to be prescribed in the schedule to the Bill, the maximum standard width to be 80 feet from the middle of the roadt(4;(5)Within the Road Improvement Line no building development would normally be allowed after the scheme    comes into operation, except on an undertaking that no compensation would be claimed therefor when the land taken over for road purposes..s ultimatelyThe Minister of Transport should have an over-riding power to enforce the specified width in respect  of any classified road-or after public enquiry in respect of an unclassified read.H.. B.   Some Members of the Committee consider that the Minister of Transport  should not be able to exercise his over-riding power in any case except after a public enquiry has been held;    we leave for the decision of the Cabinet the  question whether the recommendation in (5) should be modified in this sense.(6) Compensation should be payable by the highway authority in every case where property is injuriously affected by the restrictions imposed.,  subject to the following qualifications:(a)  compensation in respect of injurious affection should not be paid until the owner is actually prevented from developing his land in such a manner as he could and would have done but for the restrictions;
(b) in the case of all new roads there would be no compensation arising out of the imposition of the restrictions;(c)    compensation would not be paid in the circumstances referred to in (4)  above where development is permitted temporarily within the Road Improvement Line.N.B.  The local authority would,,  of course, pay in the normal way for land actually acquired for road purposes, and would also pay compensation in all cases of &quot;severance&quot;.(7)    Power should be given to all highway authorities to purchase land within 220 yards from the middle of any road within their area for the purpose of preserving amenities.(8)    Power should also be given to enable localauthorities to provide garages and to require garage or parking accommodation in connection with new buildings.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeP.

APPENDIX A,SCHEDULE OP STANDARD WIDTHS FOR ROADS.Notes concerning the various types of lay-out which could he provided within the proposed standard widths (see attached drawings of cross sections).Type NQ.1.     Highway Authorities already in many cases prescribe improvement lines which provide for an effective width of 60 feet between fences on classified roads in rural areas.     This permits of the ultimate construction of a central carriageway 30 feet wide, with two verges, each 15 feet In width9 for the construction of footways and space for underground mains and services.Type No.2.     On classified roads of greater traffic value (e. g. those in industrial areas) a width of 80 feet Is frequently provided.     Such a lay-out provides for a central carriageway 30 feet in width and ultimately for dual carriageways of 20 feet each with central islands of 4 feet.Type No.3.      Illustrates an alternative lay-out providing for dual carriageways but with an overall width of 80 feet.     The outside verges are only 7 feet and insufficient for a footway when development occurs.      This alternative would only be adopted where through traffic is the main consideration and development is unlikelyeTyper NO. 4.     Many arterial roads have a width of 100 feet between fences and in the initial stages a central carriageway 30 feet wide has been provided.     This dimension will enable the carriageway to be eventually 44 feet wide (as in Type No.2) leaving accommodation for footways and underground mains and services.Type No.5.      Illustrates an alternative lay-out adopted for the more modern arterial road and provides for dual carriageways each 27 feet in width with a central reservation of 12 feet, a reasonable amount of verge accommodation but Insufficient to provide service roads or cycle tracks.tao iType No.6.     Provides for a width of 3?0O feet between fences and is similar to that adopted for the Kingston By-Pass and suitable for important traffic routes in urban areas.      This lay-out provides a central carriageway 30 feet in width with two service roads each 16 feet wide.     The intermediate verges are sufficient to enable the carriageway to be widened to 44 feet when required.iType No.7.      Illustrates the lay-out adopted for the Liverpool section of the Liverpool-East Lancashire Road, where the central reservation is used for trams.a IType No.8.      Provides a width of 140 feet between fences and a lay-out suitable for arterial roads in urban or semi-urban areas where service roads and a one-way traffic system for through traffic are essential.     The verges between the main and service I carriageways are 11 feet in width, and afford reasonable accommodation for the erection of trees and underground mains and services.
Type No.9.     Provides a ^10th of-160 feet Isetween fences, permits the construction of aual carriageways, service roads and provides sufficient spaces.&quot;between these carriageways for the provision of cycle tracks with an additional footway where required.Widths of 100 feet or more between fences would only be required on roads of an arterial character or In urban areas where the traffic is heavy.      It will be seen that even a width of 100 feet is insufficient to provide for dual carriageways and service roads and that a satisfactory lay-out requires a width of 120 feet or more.The maximum width of 160 feet would be adopted on heavily trafficked roads in urban areas where It is not only important to provide service roads but to segregate the different classes of traffic.
