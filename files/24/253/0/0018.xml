MEAT THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSUATION.explained, that the-object of the Meeting was to ask the advice of the Dominion Representatives on a very difficultferencehDominion question which had arisen.      Before outlining thispreservatives.question he (Mr0 Thomas) wished to mention one  other matter.      At their last Meeting on the 18th December, they had been faced with a difficult situation but he was very glad to say that as a result of the united efforts of all those present at that Meeting the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia had reconsidered the position and had acquiesced in the arrangements for regulating the meat market up to the 31st March, 1935. This was evidence of the great value of these meetings^ The difficulty to which he had referred was this. A communication had been received from Mr, Lyons (the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia)  asking in effect that the negotiations on long-term policy should be deferred until after his arrival in the United Kingdom.      This in the circumstances was a very reason-able request, and Mr0 Lyons had been informed that his wishes in this respect would be met.This arrangement, however,   gave rise to a point of difficulty.The Meeting would remember that last summer the United Kingdom Government had decided, as a purely temporary measure to get over the immediate difficulty, to give a subsidy to the home meat producers      It was made clear at the time that this subsidy would come to an end on the 31st March,  1935, and a provision to this effect was contained in the Statute authorising the payment of the subsidy.      It had also been provided in the Statute that the subsidy should be of the nature of a loan &quot;or advance,   to be repaid to the Exchequer out
o U ^of the proceeds of the levy on imported meat when, as was contemplated last year, that levy came into oper-ation under the long-term policy.Up to the 31st March about  2, 500*000 weuld have been found by the Exchequer for this meat subsidy,.      The con-tinuance of the subsidy after the 31st March would not only constitute a serious financial burden on the Exchequer but would also mean the piling up of debt charged on the future levy.Mr. Lyons would arrive in the United Kingdom about the end of March,  and clearly there would be no time after his arrival and before the 31st March to determine the long-term policy which was to operate as from that date. In these circumstances the question was what should be done?Notwithstanding that the subsidy had been paid for 6 months, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was disappointed as regards the present yield to the home meat producer. It was very disturbingthat notwithstanding this large payment of money from the Exchequer the home producer was only receiving for his meat about the same price that he was getting before the subsidy started.In his (Mr* Thomas&apos;s) view it was not unreasonable for the Dominions to ask that they should be definitely informed what the ultimate policy of the United Kingdom was in regard to agricultural development,    las it proposed, for example,  to put 100*000 more men on the land?   Mr, Lloyd George&apos;s figure was of the order of 1,000,000. This question the United Kingdom Government would be prepared to discuss when Mr. Lyons arrived, but it was quite clear that the very heavy task of formulating and agreeing a long-term policy could not possibly be accomplished before the 31st March next,  the date on which the subsidy terminated.
9 n ^Would the Dominions he prepared to acquiesce in a temporary levy after the 31st March?  coupled with a Dominion preference?     An alternative would he to impose temporarily some form of quantitative regulation, probably of a drastic nature.      It must be realised that the Dominions had already indicated their grave objections to this latter alternative? and he (Mr.  Thomas) felt that if drastic -quantitative regulation, even on a strictly temporary basis, was imposed after March 31st,,  such a had atmosphere would be created that it would be most difficult,  if not impossible, to negotiate successfully any long term scheme.In order that thcsse present might appreciate the difficult;/ he had spoken very frankly and he would now ask the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to state the position as regards prices.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE Aim FISHERIES said that there had been adverse reactions in the market which had gone down over the weekend.      Roughly, the present prices were 5/- below the prices ruling last year before the subsidy was granted.      If the subsidy was taken into account, the home producer might at the moment be receiving a few pence more than he got last Summer, but by the end of March even this alight advantage would probably have disappeared. It was  quite out of the question for the United Kingdom Government to  take no action whatever.      If nothing was done, the position of the home producer after the 31st March, when the subsidy terminated,  would be an impossible one.SIR JAMES PARR said that he gathered that the Dominions were being asked to consider a purely temporary arrangement after the 51st March.      Was it possible to indicate how long this temporary arrangement would last?
THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES thought that three months would &quot;be too short and he would prefer a period of six months.MR. BRUCE agreed that the situation was a difficult one.     As he understood the position, the United Kingdom Government were not prepared to continue the subsidy after the 31st March, and they desired some temporary arrangement for, say, a period of six months, within which the long-term policy might be negotiated.     He also gathered that for political and economic reasons, the United Kingdom Government could not contemplate a policy of inaction after the termination of the subsidy on March 31st.      In these circumstances, the Dominions were invited to accept for a temporary period either a levy with a Dominion preference, or some kind of drastic quantitative regulation. In his view, either of these alternatives would give rise to very great trouble and inconvenience, and would create a very had atmosphere within which to negotiate.In his (Mr. Bruce&apos;s) view, the better course would be to proceed forthwith to discuss the long term policy, and for the Dominion Representatives in London to keep their Governments fully informed in regard to the discussions. Mr. Lyons might,  in this event, be expected to reach England before the negotiations had &quot;been finally concluded. He (Mr. Bruce) was sure that Australia would not agree to some temporary arrangement &quot;based either on a levy with Dominions preference, or on quantitative regulation, and that the only solution, therefore,- must be to enter upon and expedite the long term policy discussions.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that the difficulty was that unless some action was taken the market would collapse after March 31st.MR. BRUCE oh served that his idea had &quot;been that the long-term policy might &quot;be brought into operation immediately after Ma r ch 3.1 s t *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS doubted whether having regard to the terms of his arrangement with Mr. Lyons it would be practicable to reach a definite agreement on the long-term policy in the absence of the latter.-MR. BRUCE entirely agreed that whatever was done in this respect must be done with Mr. Lyons&apos;  full approval. It would be necessary to explain the difficulties of the situation to him.      There were considerable advantages in the discussions on the long-term policy taking place in London before Mr.  Lyons left Australia, as he (Mr. Lyons) would then be in a position to consult with his colleagues and the interests concerned on the spot.      In his view this was more likely to result in ultimate agreement than if the whole of the negotiations were postponed until Mr. Lyons&apos; arrival in England.      Australian political considerations made close consultation with his colleagues very necessary in this particular matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS agreed and pointed out that regard must also be had to political consider^rt^ns^in Canada which would be faced with a general election in the near future.
*5 n ;?MR. BRUCE observed that all that he had been saying was dependent on the fact that the United Kingdom felt precluded after March 31st from offering any alternative to &quot;either a levy with Dominion preference or quantitative regulation.      If, however,  there was any other conceivable way, for example by a continuance of the present subsidy, of obtaining a breathing space for two or three months the position would be different,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS pointed out that this suggestion of Mr. Bruce&apos;s would involve his (Mr, Thomas)  approaching the Chancellor of the Exchequer and saying that, not withstanding all the assurances which had been given, that the subsidy would terminate on March 31st, a new situation had arisen examination of which had led those present at the Meeting to the view that the best course would be a continuance of the subsidy for a few month so      He  (Mr.  Thomas) need not repeat to the Meeting the serious financial and political difficulties and objections to which any such solution was open.MR.  TE WATER observed that the difficulty regarding procedure appeared to be one with which Australia was mainly concerned.      If a solution of this difficulty agreeable to Australia could be found he for one would welcome immediate discussion of the long-term policy.      In his opinion a purely temporary arrangement would be necessary for a period after March 31st.      As regards a levy his Government would acquiesce provided that it was coupled with some plan of quantitative regulation,  and subject to the condition it could be made definitely effective.      As regards this last point it would be necessary for him to obtain further instructions from his Government as to what precisely they meant by this condition.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOE DOMINION AFFAIRS observed that when the Government of the Union of South Africa said that the arrangements must be effective, they should realise that while the subsidy scheme might not have done what had been hoped in the way of raising prices, things might have been very much worse if no action at all had been taken.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES stated that if the subsidy was taken off on March 31st and prices fell as it was anticipated they would do, the home producer would demand the  imposition of drastic quantitative, regulation to operate on all shipments arriving here after 1st April;    this would mean cuts all round.MR.  WRIGHT said that he desired to asseciate himself with wh-it Mr,,  Bruce had said in regard to long-term policyDMR.  DULANTY said that he had no observations tomake,,SIR JAMES PARR said that the position of New Zealand was different from that of Australia,,    New Zealand was now in the middle of her killing season, and it was imperative that her farmers should know to what extent they were covered after March 31st for a period of at least three,  or still better sixs months.The levy was open to grave difficulties and the New Zealand producers would only, be reassured when a programme of five or seven years had been determined,, He felt, however,  that not much progress was possible until the Dominions knew what  the United Kingdom pro-posed to do as regards the Argentine
THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS pointed out that a levy could nob he imposed on the Argentine until 18 months had elapsed.SIE JAMES PARR asked whether it was the settled policy of the. United Kingdom Government to recover the meat subsidy out of the future levy,  and was informed that this was a statutory requirement and that the answer was accord-ingly in the affirmative.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that whatever might happen in the next 18 months it was necessary to look beyond that period whan all concerned would be free from the Ottawa and Argentine Agreements and would then be faced with&apos; an entirely fresh situation.SIR JAKES PARR said that what was troubling him was the position 6 months from now.    Had the scope and impli-cations of a long term agreement been fully realised?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that it was obvious that there would be great difficulty and differences of opinion before an agreed solution could be found.      The United Kingdom were faced with questions of this  character.      How could we preserve and expand our export trade which was vital to our national existence? How far were the Dominions prepared to take our industrial products in exchange for their primary products?    Or how far were the Dominions determined, to develop their secondary industries and so compel us, whether we liked it or not, to expand our agricultural production?     What policy should be adopted in the case of foreign countries which were prepared to take our Industrial goods in exchange for their agricultural products?     The Dominions must realise that a great expansion of agricultural products in the United Kingdom would be fatal to them,  since the United Kingdom was their sole market.      It must,  of course, be assumed
that the United Kingdom was anxious to do all that was practicable to assist the Dominions,  and he would like to know whether, as between the two possible alternatives, the Dominions would prefer a levy with a preference to some drastic scheme of quantitative regulation.MR.  FERGUSON thought that the best course would be for discussions to proceed,  the Dominion Representatives keeping their Governments informed of all developments pending the arrival in London of the Dominions Prime Ministers.    He was not prepared to say how his Government would regard the alternatives to which the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had referred.    He trusted that the discussions would proceed in the hope of reaching some conclusion, and bearing in mind the possibility of a short temporary arrangement pending the bringing into operation of a long-term policy.      When his Government understood all the implications of the situation he  thought that they would endeavour to co-operate in reaching an agreed solution.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that he felt bound to acquiesce in what appeared to be the general view of the Meeting that after the 31st March the subsidy should be continued.     Accordingly he proposed to inform his Ministerial colleagues that the Dominion Representatives would like to proceed immediately with the long-term policy discussions witb-out waiting for the arrival of Mr. Lyons.      Further, that it was the view of the Dominion Representatives that it would be a mistake to have recourse to a temporary interim policy of a levy or quantitative regulation, but that they would favour the continuance for a few months of the existing meat subsidy. While he was prepared to bring these views before his  colleagues he could not, of course, give any undertaking that they would be favourably entertained.
ME. BRUCE objected to its &quot;being said that the request for the continuance of the subsidy had come from the Dominion representatives-    Australia was determined to reach a long-term policy with the least possible del ay s and was getting very near the point where, if the whole issue was put to her,  she might agree to a settlement on comprehensive lines.THE SECRETARY OE STATE PGR DOMINION AFFAIRS and the MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES explained to the meeting what would be involved in the way of legislation etc.  if the subsidy was to be continued after the 31st March.    The legislation would have to be passed into law before that date;    it would certainly be highly.contentious, and there might be difficulty in finding a time for it, having regard to the congested state of the Parliamentary time-table.    If the Bill was to become law before March 31st it -would have to be introduced very soon after the recess, and a decision must, therefore, be reached within the next few days.    Moreover, on the reassembling of Parliament, the Government would be questioned as to their policy after the 31st March, and these questions -would have to be answered.    The legislation might be drawn so as to empower the extension of the subsidy for brief periods by Order mr.. te WATER pointed out that when the temporary subsidy was adopted last year it had been generally anticipated that it would be possible to introduce a long-term policy after the 31 st March, and, indeed, the subsidy had been limited to that date for this reason0    How was it proposed to explain the delays which had occurred and to justify the further postponement of the bringing into operation of a long-term policy?
SIR JAMES PARR suggested that the short answer to this question was that the United Kingdom had not found it possible to persuade the Dominions to agree to their long-term proposals.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS agreed with Sir James Parr.    The United Kingdom had never been able to persuade the Dominions to accept their proposals, and they had &quot;been most careful to refrain from any attempt to enforce their views on the Dominions:.SIR JAMES PARR said that it was imperative,  from the point of view of New Zealand, that they should know how the meat imports into the United Kingdom during the next six months were to be allocated between the various sources o f supply,,THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS&apos;thought that the answer to the question what the allocation would be in the case of each Dominion must depend on whether the subsidy was continued after the 31st March or net.SIR JAMES PARR thought that the best plan would be for the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to consult with his colleagues, and that another meeting should then take place with the Dominion representatives.MR. te WATER thought that it would not be necessary to have a further meeting with the Dominion representatives on this point unless the United Kingdom Government as a whole felt unable to adopt the policy of a temporary continuance of the &quot;s&quot;subsidy.    If, however, the United Kingdom Government agreed to continue the subsidy, then it would only be necessary for a Committee of Experts to discuss the question of allocation.THE SECRETARY&quot; OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that he would now report to his colleagues the unanimous view of the-11-
i) J, &amp;Dominion representatives, that it would, he a profound mistake to terminate the meat subsidy pending the discussion of the long-term policy and the visit of the Dominion Prime Ministers to the United Kingdom,    He (Mr. Thomas) would add that he fully shared this view.    If the United Kingdom Government decided to extend the subsidy, the arrangements for the enactment of the necessary legislation would he made forthwith, and a Committee of United Kingdom and Dominion Experts would examine forthwith the allocation of supplies for the temporary period (say six months) to he covered by the extension of the subsidy.    The discussions on long-term policy should be opened on the earliest practicable date and without waiting for the arrival in England of Mr. Lyons or other Dominion Ministers.The Meeting agreed with the proposals of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs as set out above.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR DOMINION AFFAIRS went on to say that.in the discussions on long-term policy the  United Kingdom representatives would make it clear what was proposed in relation to each of the major items of the agricultural industry, i.e. what the position was at the present time,  and to what extent development was contemplated.      The Dominion representatives, for their part, would, he hoped, be able to show the position as regards their own agriculture and also in relation to their secondary industries.      From these facts it should be possible to work towards an appropriate balance of the various factors involved.MR. FERGUSON suggested that the important thing was for the United Kingdom long-term policy to be set out clearly. He felt that this course would be preferable to each Dominion separately giving their own views *
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS .thoughtthat all should, contribute proposals, and pointed out thatthe United Kingdom Government would want to know whatdevelopments in the foreign trade policy of the variousDominions was likely to he.    He felt no doubt that any difficulties in this direction would be overcome, but it would be necessary to face them squarely.MR. FERGUSON remarked that the foreign trade policy ofthe United Kingdom also required to be brought into the picture, especially in relation to the Argentine and Denmark.MRo BRUCE asked whether,  in the review of long-term policy,  two periods had not to be taken into consideration, the first of about IS months, until the expiration of the Argentine Agreement, to which what might be called a &quot;short-long&quot; policy was applicable, and the second the longer subsequent period&apos;?      As regards the latter,  if the United Kingdom Government asked what Australia would give them for a really big opportunity to expand their share of the home meat trade, he would say that they would offer almost everything.      Even an embargo on the importation of foreign motor cars,  or at least 7b% of the imported motor car trade might, for instance, be contemplated,,      On the other hand, regarding the first period of 18 months only, it had to be realised that the United Kingdom was bound by treaty and probably could not give the Dominions the home trade in beef and mutton, because they were bound by the agreements with foreign countries s,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS then reverted to the question of the legislation necessary to carry into effect a temporary extension of the subsidy.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES suggested that the legislation need not fix any definite date but should authorise the Board of Trade to proceed by order.      He observed
that the pressure on Parliamentary time at the present moment was very severe,MR. TE WATER interposed at this -point to say that apart from Australia, all the Dominions were prepared to commence immediately with the discussion of long-term policy with a view to a settlement by the 31st March.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS observed that settlement would have to be made in advance partly to give time for any necessary legislation that an agreement might call for,  and also because shipments must be regulated before they left the exporting Dominion, in some cases six weeks before they arrived in this country.      In that way a decision would have to be reached within the next fortnight at least % if it were to come into effective operation by the 31st March. He added that the difficulties encountered in reaching agree-ment might also be formidable,  and gave as an instance those experienced since the problem of long-term policy had begun to be discussed with the High Commissioners in the past year.Returning to Mr. Bruce&apos;s reference to an 18 months period in which the United Kingdom was bound by the treaties, he observed that the treaties with foreign countries in questionfollowed upon,  and were complementary to,  the Ottawa Agreements.He would have to make it clear in the course of the negotia-tions  that industrialists in this country were loudlyproclaiming that the industrial benefits expected by the UnitedKingdom from the Ottawa Agreements had not materialised.MR. BRUCE said that such a claim, could not be regardedinto Australiaas wholly correct.      Imports from the United Kingdom/had,&apos; sofar as figures were available,  increased by some 8%,  and totalimports by 32% - 35%a      The importance of the meat trade toAustralia could not be exaggerated.      He hoped that, when it came to discussing the policy in the period subsequent to -1936, the United Kingdom Government would take the line that-14-I.....I........Hi......1.......Hi.....i.....I........- -  ixra&amp;H * ------------........... &apos;----.......JwifflHiiiWH&apos; iwuiiia_______iiminrwm....................as.....i........._______________........_____________namrawOTHwmwigmMa^
they would give the Dominions the widest possible opportunities  in the market,  subject only to safeguarding the British home producer.      As regards the -short-long&quot; policy he understood that the United Kingdom Government could not go on paying the subsidy for 18 months %    and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might even argue that a three months extension might prove fruitless.      But he would like to emphasise that in his view the time had not and would not be wasted, and that so far as opinion in Australia was concerned, a great deal of progress had been made since the problem had first come under discussion.      He thought that the time was, perhaps, drawing near when Australia would be prepared to accept the United Kingdom Government&apos;s proposals for the 18 months,  if the issue was  put to them quite clearly and definitely.MR.  TE WATER enquired whether Mr. Bruce would be prepared to contemplate a decision being reached as regards the policy for the 18 months period, without waiting for Mr. Lyons&apos;  arrival in this country.MR. BRUCE said he thought the negotiations should at any rate begin at once.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS,  replying to Mr. Te Water,  said that he did not think a decision on the long-term policy, applicable after 1936, would reach finality until the Dominion   Prime Ministers had arrived.He said that he would communicate again with the Dominion representatives as soon as he had received a reply from his Cabinet colleagues on the points he had undertaken to raise with them in the earlier part of the Meeting.The Dominion High Commissioners undertook to prepare estimates of probable shipments of meat of all classes to
the United. Kingdom in the first two succeeding quarters after the 31st March, 1935,The Meeting then terminated,.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. January 23rd,  1935.
