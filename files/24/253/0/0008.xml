THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1935,SECRET. Copy No.CP. 8 (35).CABINET.NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo enclosing a memorandum by Mr. Sansom, the Commercial Counsellor to the Embassy, on Anglo-Japanese relations from the economic point of view.The President of the Board of Trade is circulating a letter from the Director of the Federation of British Industries,(x) arguing on behalf of the Federation^ recent mission to Japan and Manchukuo that Japan would give us commercial advantages in China and Manchuria, in return for some political understanding. Mr. Sansom, it will be seen, does not agree. He has thirty years&apos; experience of Japan, and is generally acknowledged to be the greatest living authority on that country. I have no hesitation in considering that his opinion must be the authoritative one in this matter.I also circulate a memorandum on the subject by the head of the Far Eastern Department of the Foreign Office,J. S.Foreign Office, January 11, 1935.C j. &amp;48[f 7162/S91/23]Sir R. Clive to Sir John Simon, (Received December 4.) (No. 588.   Confidential.)Sir, Tokyo, November 10, 1934.SINCE my arrival in this country in June, the impression has gained on me that the Japanese are feeling a little&apos; less sure of themselves. The reaction to the statement of the 17th April by the Foreign Office spokesman had increased that vague fear of isolation, the stalwart loyalty of Mr. Latham had shown them that the British Empire could not so easily be divided, open anxiety had manifested itself of an Anglo-American bloc to resist J apanese naval pretensions, the entry of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics into the League of Nations within a few months of Soviet recognition by the United States appeared to weaken their international position, and, finally, the War Department, breathing injured innocence and defiance in their pamphlet of the 1st October, showed Japan surrounded by potential enemies and with no friends. The latter, as I have endeavoured to make clear, did not represent the views of the Japanese Government, but rather of the younger officers an element, none the less, of great importance in the country. i2. In the memorandum which I have the honour to enclose, the commercial counsellor, writing with thirty years&apos; experience of Japan and ah intimate knowledge of the Japanese business world, discusses the question of Anglo-Japanese relations from the economic standpoint.  Politics and economics cannot,(1) CP. 9 (35).7739   [11013] s
however, be dissociated to-day. To put the matter in the simplest form, the Japanese would welcome a political understanding with Great Britain, while His Majesty&apos;s Government are far more likely to be interested in an economic agreement with Japan to relieve the pressure of Japanese competition. But, as Mr. Sansom points out, the only condition upon which we could induce Japan voluntarily to afford us relief from her competition would be an undertaking on&apos; our side to give political support to Japan. &quot; Can Japan,&quot; he says, &quot; give us any economic advantages sufficient to justify our mortgaging our political future in the Far East?&quot; and again, &quot; Japanese competition is a very serious matter, but its intensity and range are apt to be exaggerated in some quarters. . . . The lapse of time will, I hope, reveal weaknesses in her economic structure of which we may justly take advantage.&quot;3. That is broadly the problem confronting His Majesty&apos;s Government. The ways of the Japanese, as of any oriental Government, are often inscrutable, and to the Western mind the action of the Japanese Government in raising the oil question in a most acute form at a time when she is anxious to obtain British sympathy and has let it be known that she would like a political understanding is incomprehensible.I have, &amp;c.R. H. CLIVE.Enclosure.Memorandum by Mr. Sansom respecting A nglo-Japanese Relations.BEFORE leaving for a tour in Manchuria it may, I think, be worth while to put on record some opinions which I have formed in the past few months (and especially during the visit of the Federated British Industries Mission) concerning Anglo-Japanese relations both economic and political, for the two cannot at present be separately considered.Stated in general terms, the problem appears to be a very simple one :-(1) The United Kingdom desires relief from the pressure of Japanese competition.(2) Japan desires relief from, the pressure of world-wide disapproval of her policies.(3) Can any bargain be made on this basis ?The answer depends, of course, upon the nature of the conditions which would be put forward by each side.(1) As part of such a bargain, relief from Japanese competition would have to take the form of restrictions, enforced by the Japanese Government, affecting the quantity or the direction (or both) of Japanese exports. The Japanese Government already has powers (Staple Industries Control Law, and export guild legislation of various kinds) by which such restrictions could be enforced. Hitherto these powers have been used on the whole sparingly. There have, it is true, been several instances where exports have been limited, but in nearly every case the limitation has been enforced in order to forestall or diminish tariff action by countries of destination in other words under pressure, rather than as the result of a far-sighted voluntary policy designed to produce a maximum return from export trade with a minimum of hostility from competing countries. The most important example is the control of cotton exports to India, carried out in pursuance of a treaty obligation. Efforts on the part of the Japanese Government to introduce export control where the country of destination has no powers of retaliation do not appear to have been frequent or successful. So far as concerns control of exports by direct restrictions upon production, I do not know of any instance where the J apanese Government have made substantial progress. Their powers under the Staple Industries Control Law are almost unlimited, but they have so far exercised them with great caution and they have shown little sign of using them vigorously against any important industry which is reluctant. The officials responsible for the working of the Control Law have, indeed, admitted to me in private conversation that they are obliged to proceed very carefully and slowly, since control imposed against the will of the maj ority of leaders in a given industry would arouse such antagonism in that industry and in other
quarters as to imperil the whole control policy of the Government. The prime object of that control policy is the regulation of production and consumption in Japan, without particular reference to exports.It may, therefore, I consider, be taken for granted that the Ministry of Commerce is neither willing nor able to enforce upon trade and industry control of such a nature and on such a scale as would afford substantial relief to us, unless the Government as a whole were convinced that such a course would be on balance advantageous to Japan. In those circumstances the Government would not hesitate to use their powers, and they would encounter a diminished resistance on the part of industry if they could persuade industry that the sacrifices it was expected to make would be in the national interest.(2) The only condition upon which we could induce Japan voluntarily to afford us relief from her competition would, in my opinion, be an undertaking from us to give political support to Japan. The exact nature of the consideration which she would require is a matter for separate discussion, but the fact that it is a political consideration which she requires has been most amply demonstrated in the past few weeks. - The arrival of the Federated British Industries Mission brought to an intensive stage the campaign of hints and suggestions which had been opened some time before, and it was impossible to mistake the significance of the approaches which were made. It is early yet to say what concrete commercial advantages will ensue from the visit of the mission. The assurance which they obtained at Hsinking was rather more definite in terms than anything I had expected; and-1 was told that, a day or two before they left Tokyo, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs sent for the head of the Mitsubishi Company and requested him to give British industry an opportunity of quoting for certain supplies for Manchuria. Apart from what I think was a genuine desire to show friendliness to the mission, the political motive here is very apparent. I think that it is not at all safe to suppose that the Japanese authorities will continue in this generous mood unless they can see some reciprocal favours ahead; and this view is confirmed by several unguarded remarks made to me by Mr. Kurusu and others.(3) It is not for me to offer an opinion as to the desirability of a political arrangement with Japan. I do not like the prospect at all, but there are many factors of Avhich I am ignorant. The object of these notes is rather to enquire whether the Japanese Government can give us any economic advantages sufficient to justify our mortgaging for good or for ill-our political future in the Far East. As I have attempted to indicated above, I very much doubt whether, even assuming a genuine intention on the part of the Japanese Government to moderate J apanese competition in foreign markets, it would be possible for them in practice to enforce upon their industry and trade restrictions which would satisfy us. At any rate, the process would be a slow and difficult one, if I may judge by the progress made in imposing control in certain recent instances where I have had opportunities to see the machinery working at close quarters.One Of the suggestions thrown out from time to time by officials and industrial leaders is that, if only the United Kingdom would &quot; co-operate &quot; (blessed word!) with Japan in China, Japanese pressure on other markets would diminish and the United Kingdom would, moreover, find an outlet for her products in China and Manchuria. This suggestion is tempting to some, but the opinion of reliable authorities whom I have consulted can be summarised in a quotation from some notes recently given me by Sir Frederick Whyte, who, after examining the situations both in China and Japan, observes : &quot; When I hear business men in Shanghai say &apos; if we back Japan she will pull the chestnuts out of the fire for us,&apos; my only answer is that when the operation is complete there will be no British chestnuts left.&quot;I by no means wish to suggest that the Japanese authorities, in holding out these prospects of commercial benefit, are deliberately attempting to hoodwink us, I think they would genuinely like to see friendly relations restored and trade rivalry sweetened. But I am sure that their idea of a good bargain is not our idea; and I think we ought to be careful not to make a bargain without being able to assess fairly accurately the value, in terms of trade, of Japan&apos;s assurances..  Since 1931 Japan has been a very difficult country to deal with, in matters both   of   diplomacy   and   commerce.     The   attitude,   now   aggressive,   now intractable,   of   the   officials   with   whom   We   have   to   do   business   has [11013] b 2
made negotiations on large and small matters extremely trying for the members of diplomatic missions in Tokyo. The intractability remains, but one can discern behind it a certain anxiety. We have had to be tactful, mollifying, even deferential; but I begin to feel that we are entering upon a new stage. The approaches that have been made to us testify that the Government are not so confident as they lately were. There are many leading industrialists and bankers who feel misgivings as to Japan&apos;s industrial future and think that she may be heading for an economic crisis, or at least for a period of difficulty, as the consequence of a too rapid and ill-balanced development. The domestic political situation is an uneasy one. All these factors lead to the conclusion that Japan will be more amenable a little later on; and I think it follows that we should not hurry to come to terms with her.Japanese competition is a very serious matter, but its intensity and range are apt to be exaggerated in some quarters. In 1933 it was ascribed to unfair methods, sweated labour, subsidies and so on. In 1934 the pendulum seems to have swung, and Japan is now often credited with something like invincibility in every sphere. The latter reading cannot be true, and the lapse of time will, I hope, reveal weaknesses in her economic structure of which we may justly take advantage.G. B. S.October 29, 1934.[F 166/61/10]The Political Aspects of Trade Rivalry or Co-operation with Japan in China.THE members of the Federation of British Industry Mission to Japan and Manchukuo, at the meeting at the Treasury on the 13th December, urged the expediency ,of concluding some sort of political understanding with Japan, arguing that Japan would be ready to give us commercial advantages in return for such an understanding; if nothing more obvious and direct resulted, at any rate so they seemed to feel, Japan would be willing to give us a handsome share in the China market, from which she would otherwise drive us out. An understanding might, for instance, take the form of agreement for mutual consultation in regard to policy in China.2. Mr. Locock&apos;s letter of the 10th December to Sir Horace Wilson includes the following paragraphs : &quot; The greatest guarantee of the peace of the Far East appears to us to lie in an improvement of the relations between Japan and China. We suggest that Great Britain, by establishing friendly relations with Japan and thus being in a position to exercise a restraining influence, might play a great part in bringing this about. Any common policy towards China would have to be based upon the policy of the open door, and should not therefore be contrary to the interests of any country, including America. Furthermore, it would have to be such as to prove to China that a genuine attempt was being made to help her out of her present difficulties. We cannot attach too much importance to this question of Sino-Japanese relations and the necessity of an understanding between Japan and Great Britain on the policy which is to be adopted in China.&apos;&apos; We should like to emphasise that the solution of our trade difficulties with Japan, and the extent to which British industry will be given opportunities to participate in the development of Manchukuo, will, in our opinion, depend very largely upon whether the political relations between &quot;Japan and Great Britain can be placed upon a basis of friendly co-operation.&quot;3. At the meeting, after a general discussion in which certain difficulties were pointed out, the members of the mission welcomed a suggestion thrown out by Sir Horace Wilson that we might turn over in our minds the possibility of arriving at an understanding with Japan as to measures, in which China and other Powers might join, to provide for the rehabilitation of China by joint efforts. The test of readiness to assist in such a task would be willingness to lend money for the purpose. . &quot;
- ; 4. The present paper is an attempt to clear the ground from the political angle. The matter can be further examined by those competent to do so from a more technical and commercial point of view, if a political survey is found to make it worth while to do so.       - ...5. It is not proposed here to deal with the extra-Chinese-considerations affecting the United States, the Dominions, Russia and the East Indies, which arise from any proposal for. a general political agreement with Japan. This oround has already been fairly well covered in other minutes and memoranda, and it may perhaps be taken for granted that nothing can be done which would tend to open a breach between us and the United States Government. It is also perhaps unnecessary for the present purpose to consider just how far we could go with Japan without giving offence to the United States, for I think it will appear from an examination of the Chinese aspect of the problem that we shall not be able, for the sake of our interests in China-which in the present context is the first consideration to go so far as might impair our relations with the United States.6. The fundamental questions to consider are the nature of Japanese ambitions in China and the extent to which we can afford to become identified with them in the minds of the Chinese. It is difficult to do good trade with a hostile people, and we can hardly hope to do so with a hostile China. Japanese trade may recover relatively quickly from the effects of Chinese resentment, but Japan has an advantage, which we do not share, in the suitability of her cheap goods to the Chinese market and the absence of any adequate alternative source of supply for such wares. This, incidentally, is a consideration which has a bearing on the possibly valid argument that China could not boycott Japanese and British goods simultaneously.7. There can be no doubt about the generally aggressive spirit of Japanese policy. So far as any major effort, against Russia, for instance, is concerned, financial and economic weakness may set limits to the exercise of this spirit, but with its continued existence we must undoubtedly reckon, and there seem to be special reasons for expecting recurrent manifestations of such a spirit against China^ even if we discount the extremer forms of doctrine which proclaim &apos;&apos; Asia for the Asiatics and Japan the leader and organiser of all the Asiatic peoples.&quot; For reasons of self-preservation and of livelihood, Japan must inevitably seek to be the dominating influence in China. Self-preservation dictates watchfulness to prevent China from becoming so effectively organised, by whatever agency, native or foreign, as to be a potential military menace. Livelihood demands, and with the continual increase of the population of Japan will more and more urgently demand, the largest possible share of the Chinese market for Japanese manufactures. Were Japan of a different and essentially pacific nature, *she might see natural causes in both the defects and the qualities of the Chinese character sufficient in themselves to protect her from any military danger from China, unless, indeed, through some outside influence and guidance China were to become militarised. And the development of the Chinese market might well follow more quickly from a purely peaceable attitude towards her. But such is not the Japanese character, and we must expect to see attempts at control persist and multiply. There will be constant friction between rival forms of arrogance; the subtlety and quicker intelligence of the Chinese in obstruction is likely still to exasperate the energetic and efficient Japanese mind into periodical attempts to cut the Gordian knot and solve the difficulties by force. Chinese antagonism will thus be kept alive and boycotts will recur from time to time. The course of events might, indeed, be modified if the rest of the world were united in a settled peace and if Great Britain and the United States were able to exert their strength in the Far East. But the omens are all the other way and the chances are that we shall see parallels in the future to the &quot; Twenty-one Demands &quot; of 1915 and the rape of Manchuria in 1931. We cannot morally afford in the present-day world to put ourselves in the same camp with an exponent of such policies. On the side of local expediency, I do not think we could afford to do so unless Japan were capable of demanding and controlling China as she does Manchuria. I am quite sceptical about her power to do so in view of the strain which Manchukuo itself puts and will, I believe, continue to put upon her, and the extraordinary power of elastic resistance possessed by the Chinese, that old but remarkably vital and intelligent race. This view has only been confirmed by remarks recently made to me by Mr. Mouw, the Adviser on Far Eastern affairs in the Dutch East Indies,
whose opinion is worthy of respect, and by Mr. Archibald Rose of the British-American Tobacco Company, who knows China well. Mr. Mouw said that the Japanese could not cope with the Chinese, and Mr. Rose that he had been struck by the repeated spontaneous admissions of Japanese during his last visit to China and Japan that they were baffled at every turn.8. In such conditions, the first consideration must surely be to remain on good terms with the Chinese themselves, without weakening in our resistance to their less reasonable demands. The position might be different if Japan were so free from preoccupation with Manchukuo and Russia and so free-to;defy British and American sentiment as to be able to exert her whole strength in an effort to control China. She might then possibly succeed in doing so for a time, for limited purposes, but, in such an event, is there any likelihood of her leaving Us anything but a minimum share in the market, whatever she might have led us to expect in return for political benefits to herself ?9. There seems, then, a poor case, so far as the Far Eastern market is con-cerned, for a political understanding with Japan of a kind which might lead the Chinese to identify us with Japanese policy towards China. Of that policy they are with good reason ineradicably suspicious and, while it may be true that they could not maintain a boycott against us and Japan simultaneously, I believe that, setting aside the moral issue and the repercussions we might suffer elsewhere, we should have more to lose than to gain by a policy which would lead to such an identification. The Japanese have before now attempted to get our political co-operation with them in China, and it has never been possible to see any basis for such co-operation. Our aims, and the only respectable aims, are those indicated in the Nine-Power Treaty non-interference and equal opportunity for all in China. Japan&apos;s aims are radically different, and while they remain so there is no possibility of a common policy, while even one of mutual consultation could not strike deep and, if formally set up and declared, would offer more dangers than advantages. The fact,is that Japan, while her fundamental aims are clear and persistently followed, has not clearly admitted to herself that those aims are partly immoral, and that she cannot, to the extent that they are so, expect us to co-operate with he?. Her mind on certain levels is divided and confused. It behoves Us to keep clear of entanglement with the less.reputable side of it, while maintaining sympathetic contact with the other, and to pursue a patient and steady course.10. This brings us to the point that there is nothing in the situation to preclude a policy of general friendliness with Japan; we must continue to consult her legitimate interests and not to seek to edge her out of what is her due. We can welcome any development of friendly feeling between her and China if properly grounded, and any disposition she may show to help China to greater prosperity. Here we come to the suggestion thrown out by Sir Horace Wilson (see paragraph 3 above). I must confess that I see considerable difficulties about it. The Chinese attitude, in the first place, is all-important. China is highly suspicious of anything with a Japanese flavour. She may have to compromise with Japan direct, but she will always do so with the intention of recovering her ground at the first opportunity, and she will, I think, remain opposed to any concerted movement in which the Japanese have a hand; for she will feel that in such a movement she&apos; will have a combination to deal with, and one in which her worst enemy will have support. Apart from the Japanese aspect, she is, in view of past experience, opposed to dealing with a combination of Powers, and greatly prefers to deal with them separately. The China Consortium, of which Japan is a member, is distasteful to her on both grounds. She has seen in it not only Japanese participation, hateful in itself, but an instrument of foreign interference and control. She is very willing to set up her own organisation in the China Development Finance Corporation, with which foreign finance can co-operate, as and when she invites its assistance&apos;, but anything suggested to her from outside arouses her suspicion and offends her vanity. She is not backward in seeking foreign help, but it must in general come as a result of her own initiative. The rehabilitation and development of China must, I feel sure, proceed for a long time to come in a piecemeal manner. The necessary degree of political and administrative unity and continuity^) for comprehensive measures(x) As an illustration, I am told that the efficient organisation created by T. V. Soong, when Minister of Finance, for the collection of the so-called &quot; consolidated tax &quot; on business in certain commodities, is now crumbling away.
does not exist. This view of the necessarily piecemeal character of China&apos;s development was also expressed to me by M. Haas, the able Trench member of the League of Nations Secretariat, who was secretary of the Lytton Commission. Probably no good judge will disagree. But the moral seems to be that there is no obvious place for any comprehensive machinery for co-ordinated assistance to China and no need to promote anything of the kind, with the attendant risk of arousing suspicions of the kind already mentioned as characteristic of the Chinese themselves. It is difficult to see what solid content could be put into an agree-ment between Powers ready to assist in rehabilitation, and if there is no solid content, the implications, real or imaginary, will take charge. The Japanese tendency will undoubtedly be to endeavour to control and direct any concerted assistance, (&quot;) and I feel that we shall best avoid difficulties, both with the Chinese and with the Japanese, and shall not really impair our own prospects in China, if we refrain from endeavouring to introduce a general coherence into the present somewhat chaotic situation. Minds naturally ardent or by predilection systematic will dislike this view, which I, nevertheless, believe to be sound. Both in space and in time, China is at present politically and administratively incoherent, but she is too vital to have coherence imposed on her from without, and our policy, on the foundation of sympathetic recognition of legitimate Chinese aspirations, which was laid in the memorandum of December 1926, must, I believe, remain for the present of an opportunist nature. It may be possible for individual enterprises to be conducted on a basis of partnership or under-standing between British manufacturers, merchants or financiers and Japanese or Chinese nationals, though there are risks involved; but this is a matter for separate consideration.C. W. ORDE.January 7, 1935.(-) Sufficient illustration of this is provided by the Japanese &quot; Hands off China &quot; declaration of April 1934, which was hardly watered down in subsequent explanations.o
