this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1935.SECRET. Copy. No.CP. 41 (35).CABINET.RELATIONS WITH SOVIET RUSSIA.I CIRCULATE herewith to my colleagues a memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which raises an important point of policy. The Soviet Ambassador has long been alluding to, and has now pressed, the desire of his Government for the visit of a British Minister. The Soviet Government desire, in fact, to receive their share of &quot; Gleich-berechtigung.&quot; No doubt such a visit would give much satisfaction in Paris as well as Moscow. There is also the negative side. The Soviet Ambassador recently informed Sir Robert Vansittart that, if the Eastern Pact were dropped out of the negotiation, people in his country would interpret the omission as an opening of the door to German aggression in the East. We have to reckon with the intensely suspicious nature of the Russian regime. There is no doubt that the desired visit would go far to allay such suspicions and consequently to facilitate negotiation, in which Russia must needs eventually figure, both for practical reasons and because Russia is now brought by Germany into every argument.I would, therefore, ask my colleagues to consider very seriously the proposal in itself, and the reasons advanced in support of it by Sir Robert Vansittart.J. S.Foreign Office, February 22, 1935.Memorandum, by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.For nearly a year it has been becoming increasingly evident that Russia is suffering from the fear of Germany, which now animates, or paralyses, Europe. In the Russian case the fear was intensified by the pressure of the other aggressive and expansionist Power on her eastern flank. The result has been an obvious modification of Russian policy. Soviet Russia has drawn closer to France and to the Little Entente witness the hitherto inconceivable Bessarabian settlement and has been making increasing bids for better relations with this, country. The progression of these bids can be traced through the series of my recorded interviews with M. Maisky, which began during the summer of 1934. Russia, in fact, under the common urge, has been offering to us, in effect,, indications of better behaviour. She has, of course, not abolished, but appears to have diminished, propaganda in this country; and seems to be sincere in discarding aggressive or, penetrative designs in Afghanistan, anyhow so long as the situation endures which brought to Geneva so vehement a former adversary of the League, These things have a significance which we, as realists, must not miss; we must not overrate the change of heart, and we must not underrate the uses to which it can be turned in the acute world-problem ahead of us.We are repeatedly, but, I think erroneously, warned that the Far East is the danger-point, and that we need not, indeed should not, worry about Europe. Soviet Russia, however, as the party most nearly affected, does not share this7808   [11123]
aview. Those, indeed, who have personal knowledge of the regions on which they dogmatise, would agree that the peak of the Russo-Japanese crisis has been temporarily passed. The crisis may, of course, recur, but at the moment there are signs of some Russo-Japanese detente in the Far East. In present circum-.stances the predominant Russian fear is of Germany, with Japan as a potential aggressor in case of trouble in Europe. This situation may of course change; but at present it appears to approximate to the Foreign Office view of our own position, which is the reasonable one so long as Russia and Japan balance and neutralise each other locally. The uses of a potential and common adversity may not be sweet, but they are important, and it behoves us to examine carefully the consequences to which it points.The Russian fear of German aggression eastward fed, of course, by the doctrines of tlerr Rosenberg, who is still in high favour with Herr Hitler has brought into view two schools in Soviet Russia, roughly embodied in the persons of MM. Litvinov and Voroshilov. The tendencies of the former have already been described, and they are to our profit, both politically and economically. The Voroshilov school and it is a strong one is that of the traditional rapproche-ment with Germany.It may at first sight be thought that the Voroshilov school, whatever its strength, is doomed to failure, at any rate so long as Herr Hitler remains Chancellor, for anti-communism and anti-semitism are his two main principles. It must be remembered, however, that, since &quot; the massacres of the 30th June,&quot; the German army is, and will remain, in the ascendant. We are likely, therefore, to witness in Germany a recrudescence of the old militarist-industrialists-junker influence upon foreign policy; and this influence has always stood for close practical relations with Russia.The imminence of any such danger must not, of course, be suggested. A Franco-Russian alliance is to-day a nearer possibility than Russo-German co-operation, But the danger exists, and it cannot be neglected, because it is great, though still remote. The latter event would, in fact^be a disaster to our present world. It would make a wider reality of that Germano-Japanese fusion, which many profess to fear already, though it would seem to be largely untrans-latable, unless we, by mismanagement, supply the missing link, which is Russia.If, therefore, we take a long though unalarmed view, it is manifest that our interest lies in the predominance of the Litvinov school over the Voroshilov school. . It follows that we should contribute to this end, particularly if we can do so at little or no cost to ourselves.In the course of our conversations the Soviet Ambassador has repeatedly stressed the desire of his Government to be treated on equal terms, and to receive  like other great Powers the visit of a British Minister. The similarity of this standpoint to the invitation recently issued by Germany must be noted, and it might also be argued that, if a visit to Germany is morally desirable, a visit to Russia is at least morally justifiable. One cannot differentiate between the two systems save in quantity.I feel strongly, however, that such a visit is more than justifiable- I even venture to think that it would be a most serious and far-reaching error to; reject an invitation so repeatedly tendered. The advantages to the Litvinov school of a British acceptance are obvious; and I must add that M. Litvinov has incautiously and prematurely spoken in Moscow as if he might expect acceptance. The blow to his precarious prestige would be all the greater in the event of a flagrant rebuff.I have not brought this matter to the notice of His. Majesty&apos;s Government  indeed I could not well do so until, in our last interview, the Soviet Ambassador became both concrete and pressing. He had previously confined himself to intimations that might or might not have been official. He has now put forward the request in a manner which leaves me in no doubt that he will very shortly indeed be returning on instructions from his Government, for an official reply.I submit that, on every ground of high and far-sighted policy, that reply must needs be in the affirmative. If so, we shall add to its value by acquiescing with apparent readiness rather than with evident reluctance.I am well aware that such a proposition must encounter some objections. To meet them I venture the personal suggestion that they may be found largely to disappear if a visit to Berlin were combined, or at least matched, with visits to Moscow and Warsaw.   Such a combination, moreover, by quieting the suspicions
of Russia and the Little/ Entente of our indifference to German aggression east-ward, will make them easier for France to handle, and will correspondingly facilitate our own inevitable dealings with France on the ensemble of the London programme. Such a visit might moreover be not only explicable, but profitable now that we have started the search for alternatives to the Eastern Pact.M. Maisky has said to me on several occasions that if, as he anticipates, the Secretary of State were too busy to pay the visit himself, his Government would be more than satisfied with a visit by Mr. Eden, or even by myself. I do not, however, think it appropriate that a public servant should receive as much publicity as would inevitably be created by such a visit.ROBERT VANSITTART.
