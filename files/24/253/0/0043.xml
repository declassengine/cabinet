422THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1935.SECRET. Copy No, 4-^CP. 42 (35).CABINET.PROGRAMME OF NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR 1935.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE programme of New Construction for 1935, which was approved by the Cabinet on the 12th December, 1934 (Cab. 46 (34), Conclusion 5), includes a Destroyer Flotilla of one Leader and eight Destroyers.2. Under the London Naval Treaty we are allowed in the Destroyer category a total tonnage of 150,000 tons, but the Treaty provides that not more than 16 per cent. (i.e., 24,000 tons) of this total tonnage shall be employed in vessels of over 1,500 tons normal displacement.3. Our newest Leaders are 1,460 to 1,475 tons and our newest Destroyers are 1,350 to 1,375 tons. We have at present eight vessels of over 1,500 tons, totalling 12,250 tons, i.e., 8 per cent, of 150,000 tons : seven of these vessels are over-age.4. As regards replacement of over-age vessels, we have available for the 1935 and 1936 Programmes together a total of about 51,000 tons, and the Leader and eight Destrcwers included in the 1935 Programme as at present authorised by the Cabinet would have absorbed about 12,500 tons of this total.5. The United States are now following the policy already adopted since 1930 by Japan, and are building powerful Destroyers mounting six 5-inch guns. The United States have building or projected ten vessels of 1,850 tons, and are believed to intend to increase that number to thirteen, which would give her her full quota of 16 per cent, of her total permitted Destroyer tonnage. Japan has 23 vessels of 1,700 tons completed. These&apos; amount to 37 per cent, of her total Destroyer tonnage, but this was specially allowed to her by the Treaty, the vessels being already under construction when the Treaty was signed.6. In the circumstances stated, the Admiralty has come to the conclusion that instead of the Leader and eight Destroyers at present authorised, we ought to lay down.in 1935 seven Destroyers of 1,830 tons displacement, i.e., a total of 12,810 tons. On completing these, and after scrapping two of the over-age vessels, we should have thirteen vessels over 1,500 tons, i.e., a total of 22,000 tons, or 14^ per cent, of the total Destroyer tonnage which we are allowed under the Treaty.7. The estimated cost of the seven vessels now proposed is  3,360,000, as against  3,250,000 for the Flotilla at present authorised.8.   I ask the approval of my colleagues to the course proposed.B. E.
