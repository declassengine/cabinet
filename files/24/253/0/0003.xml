,THIS flOOlfiflSWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI8 SRITAMKIO liAJH&amp;Ti&apos; 8 GOVERNMENT.8E0RET.. OOFY NO.CP.3(35).C A B I M S T.REPORT OP INTER-DKPARTi^TAL COMMITTEE ON TRADING IK J&amp;m. Memorandum by the president of the Board of Trade.It may be convenient to my colleagues to have, in advanceof Wednesday1s meeting, a statement of ray views on thequestions raised in the report of the Inter-departmentalCommittee on Trading in Arms over which the Lord Privy Sealpresided  5.p. 2 (3527*   The questions on which the Committeeasked for the definite political guidance of the Cabinet were-(i) Are the Government prepared to accept, as part of a Convention dealing only with the trade in and manufacture of arms, a system of permanent and automatic supervision^(ii) Is it accepted that any licensing system proposed under the Convention dealing with the trade in and manufacture of arms should be extended to include component parts?(iii) Is there to be publicity as regards orders, and imports and exports, and is such publicity to be by number or weight, or by value?My views on these three questions are as followsj-(i) I would suggest that while we must remain prepared toconsider a system of permanent and automatic supervision aspart of a general Disarmament Convention, we should not accept such a system as part of a Convention dealing only with thetrade in and manufacture of arms.     Having regard to theobligations imposed by a Convention so limited, it is difficult tosee what useful purpose visits of inspection committees to the     vvarious countries concerned would serve.      In any event, howevercircumscribed their activities, any inspection of this natureby a committee of persons owning no allegiance to this country must constitute a danger to national and industrial security.koreover, far-reaching legislation of a contentious nature(including drastic amendment of the Official Secrets Acts)would be necessary in order to afford facilities to the inspection committees and immunity to the witnesses who appear1-
before them.    These dangers and difficulties were fully described in the Report of the Sub-Committee on Supervision /p.0*(3)(54) 247.    I consider that it is quite unnecessary to do more than establish at Geneva some permanent body or bureau which would collate and publish the information furnished by the High Contracting Parties, and would conduct any enquiries found to be necessary in connection with the returns at their headquarters.(ii) Our present export licenoe system applies to component parts of armaments but &quot;does not cover goods which have not reached the stage of manufacture where they are finished or nearly finished&quot;.    I realise, of course, that those countries which do not possess any munitions industry might object unless the obligations as regards licensing and the furnishing of returns were extended to the manufacturers of component parts, and I do not wish to raise any objection in principle to such a requirement, provided that the goods to be covered canbe suitably defined.    I feel bounds however, to say that I foresee considerable difficulty in devising a definition for general adoption by all the contracting countries which would not create the gravest difficulties in practical administration. Unless care is taken, it might easily involve the application of the licensing system to practically the whole of our engineering industry.(iii) Manufacturers would properly object to s system of publicity which involved disclosure to their competitors of their prices.    I consider, however, that this question must be governed by reference to the difficulty which the Service Departments feel as regards disclosure of reserves. At the same time, I fail to see what useful purpose can be served by furnishing the permanent body with copies of orders which may never be fulfilled and of licences which may never be used.    Any attempt to check these against the statistical
returns of imports and exports and of manufacture is bound to raise difficulties and lead to protracted correspondence.The most that seems necessary for the purpose of the permanent body is a quarterly return of manufactures^ and of imports and exports under fairly wide categories, Toy weight and number, hut not fcy value.W.R.Board of Trade,6th January, 1935 .-3-
