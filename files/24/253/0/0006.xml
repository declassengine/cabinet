THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1935.SECRET. Copy No..CP. 6 (35).CABINET.MATERIAL FOR IMPENDING DISCUSSION WITH french ministers.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet this afternoon asked me to prepare, for the Cabinet meeting next Monday, a paper suggesting the general line to be taken by Ministers who will be conducting the conversations with M. Flandin and M. Laval when they visit us in ten days&apos; time. The Cabinet to-day went through the greater part of CP. 302 (34), already circulated, and the purpose of the present paper is not to repeat unnecessarily what is there contained, but to put together, in a series of numbered paragraphs, the essential suggestions of that paper, with some others, in order that a series of propositions may be authorised, so far a&amp; the Cabinet approve them.   The propositions may be thus stated.2. It will be agreed, in the first place, that this is not a case for hard and fast instructions, and that a good deal of flexibility must be allowed to Ministers conducting the discussion. We can only speculate as to the line which our French visitors are likely to wish to follow, and, if new matters of great importance emerge, it will, of course, always be possible to discuss them on the basis that final decisions must,be reserved for the Cabinet as a whole,3. We shall naturally begin with some reference to my Paris interview of the 22nd December and to the Franco-Italian agreement reached at Rome. As regards the former, it will be useful to note that French Ministers have recognised that the position taken up in the French note of the 17th April can no longer be maintained. We shall have to point out that, in the interval, Germany has not stood still, and that it is therefore to be expected that any proposal for recognising the existing limit of armaments reached in Germany will involve something more than was contained in the German document of the 16th April.4. As regards the recent Franco-Italian agreements reached at Rome, the part which is most immediately in point is the proces-verbal announced to-day to the following effect&apos;: &quot; The Italian and French Governments, referring to the Declaration of Equality of Rights of the 11th December, 1932, have found themselves in agreement in their recognition that no country can modify by unilateral act its obligations in the matter of armaments, and that in the case of this eventuality being established they should consult each other.&quot;We should inform the French Government that we had already taken up with the German Government a similar attitude, though we had not previously published the fact. After the House of Commons&apos; Debate of the 28th November and our communication to the German Government as to our information on German rearmament, we felt bound to make it clear to the German Government that they must not assume that we considered the Disarmament Clauses of Part V as no longer binding.   We therefore told them that His Majesty&apos;s Government7738   [11005]
do not recognise the right of any signatory to a Treaty to free itself from the obligations-imposed upon it without negotiation and agreement with the other signatories. -5. After these preliminaries, our main line with French Ministers must be that itis worse than useless to allow the existing situation to drift. Germany is, in fact, increasing her armaments, and the facts must be faced and dealt with in the only practicable way. It is impracticable to expect Germany to scrap what she is in process of building up in regard to armaments in order that a fresh start might be made in a new agreement. &quot;We must deal with the German situation as it is to-day, bearing in mind that the return of Germany to the - League and to the Disarmament Conference is essential for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe. We should put forward the view that, while we do not in any way condone Germany&apos;s action in leaving the League, we can conceive of no real basis for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe so long as Germany remains outside. We do not question the illegality of Germany&apos;s rearmament in breach of the Treaty, but the stage has been reached when its recognition has become inevitable. We should press strongly the point that it is far better that this rearmament should be controlled than that it should remain uncontrolled. To the objection which the French may raise that this concession amounts to condoning illegality and surrendering to what they may describe as blackmail, we should ask the French Ministers whether they have a practicable alternative. We should point out that Germany has already demanded, and will continue to demand, equality of rights. It may be that she will not be content with the idea of the status quo as far as she is concerned. But we should seek a basis for negotiation which would recognise nothing beyond what has already been done. A further increase in Germany&apos;s arms strength necessarily raises new questions as to the security of others. If the French raise the question of action under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, we should point-out that it would appear extremely unlikely that this article could be enforced. On the other hand, if we can once get a new basis for negotiation and a prospect of agreement, Germany might be expected to take up a different attitude to a system of inspection or to a system of supervision agreed to as part of a convention about armaments, provided that it is of general application to all countries.(The contents of this paragraph&quot; are in effect a summary taken from paragraph 3 of CP. 302 (34) to which the Cabinet has already given approval at its meeting to-day.)6.&apos; French Ministers may certainly be expected, in reply to the above, to raise the,question of &quot; security&quot; and to insist that the agreement of France to equality of rights was conditioned, by the terms of the document of the 11th December, 1932, by the phrase &quot;in a regime providing security for all nations.&quot; We must therefore expect to be asked what proposals we have to make to satisfy this condition. Again, we must expect to have placed before us by French Ministers proposals of their own on this subject.- 7. On the topic of security we should first emphasise that the accommo-dation which we are seeking to bring about with Germany is not designed specially for our benefit and not advocated from any willingness to prejudice the French position. Our conviction is that such an accommodation is needed in the general interests of Europe and is just as much essential to the position of France as to anyone else&quot;. We are not asking France to make sacrifices in our interest for which some special compensation is required, any more than our recent contri-bution of troops to police the Saar was specially in the interests of France, and called for a quid pro quo. In both cases it is the general pacification of Europe which is in question, and in that matter we are all equally interested.,; The longer we all hesitate to take the bold action which is now so urgently called for., the worse the situation will get for all of us and the less chance there will be of getting a contribution towards agreement from Germany. Moreover, we have announced a programme of rearmament, especially in the air, and are therefore already burdening ourselves with what amounts to,a more material contribution from which the Locarno Powers gain advantage. &apos;
8. But the above arguments will not, I am confident, enable us to carry through the impending discussion to a useful and positive result unless we formu-late in our minds and provisionally authorise our representatives to-put forward, if necessary, some contributions to security from our own side. These should be of a kind which will operate for our own security as well as for the security of -others, but French Ministers will naturally be most interested in the second of these aspects. A list of points for Cabinet consideration and approval is as follows &apos;:i (a) The French will demand, as a contribution to general security, the adherence of Germany to the proposed multilateral non-interference pact in Central Europe agreed upon in Rome. We have already indicated our general approval of the Rome Agreement and we could undertake to support the French in any way we can to bring about this result.(b) M. Laval indicated in my conversation with him on the 22nd december that during the visit to London he would wish to discuss further the proposed Eastern Pact as a concomitant of discussions about armaments. France wishes to secure the adherence of Germany and Poland to some such pact. Here again, we are already committed to support the French effort.(c) French Ministers may indicate that they require that Germany shouldconclude non-aggression pacts with her neighbours in accordance with the offer made by Herr Hitler last year. The utility of such pacts may be open to question, but in particular cases they may be helpful. We ought to be ready, therefore, in principle to give such a proposal our support.id) In connexion with a new effort to secure an agreement about armaments, and in particular an agreement authorising German armament, French Ministers are likely to refer to the subject of supervision. The French are always harking back to the argument that it is no good to negotiate an agreement of limitation with Germany because Germany will not keep it. We should be in a position to say that, as part of an international convention about armaments, we were prepared to agree to permanent and automatic supervision, including local inspection (provided, of course, that of&amp;er people did the same), in order to ensure that the convention was being duly carried out, and we should point out that Germany has declared herself ready to accept such super-vision provided it is generally applied.(e) The re-definition of our obligations under Locarno. The French realise that we cannot accept general obligations which work automatically, whether it be for the purpose of guaranteeing the execution of an armament convention or for the purpose of enforcing security generally. But they would, I think, attach much importance to the offer to give some more precision to our existing Locarno commitments. Such precision would be afforded by such proposals as the following : . (i) A British declaration, in which it would be most desirable for Italy to join, interpreting our obligations under Locarno to the effect that a flagrant invasion of, or attack upon, the territory of Belgium, would automatically be considered by Great Britain as an unprovoked act of aggression requiring Great Britain to come immediately to the help of Belgium, in accordance with Part 3 of Article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno, and that this help should be given by all- the means in her power (cf. unofficial discussions last summer with the Belgian Government on this subject). Italy would be much more likely to be prepared to subscribe to such a declaration if it constituted only a part of a general scheme for the pacification of Europe.(ii) A re-affirmation that Great Britain still considers the de militaires-tarisation of the Rhineland as a vital British interest, and will treat it as such in accordance with the Treaty of Locarno.
(iii) A declaration of what might be called &apos;&apos; the British monroe doctrine,&quot; to the effect that Great Britain would consider any attempt to interfere with the independence or integrity of Belgium [query, and Holland] as dangerous to her peace and r&apos;  v-cO security.(Note. In CP. 302 (34) it is stated that Holland might be left out, since its integrity is of less interest to France than that of Belgium. Doubts, however, have been raised as to* whether this is really the case, seeing that France is very definitely concerned with the danger that the defence of Belgium might be rendered useless by Germany carrying out a flanking movement across Dutch territory, more especially across the Maestricht salient. In any case, the vital import-ance of the integrity of Dutch territory to Great Britain is undisputed, and once Great Britain has decided to declare a Monroe doctrine as regards the Low Countries, is it not better for her not to differentiate between Belgium and Holland by making her declaration apply in the first instance only to Belgium ? There is the difficulty that Holland, unlike Belgium, has never asked for protection, but it is a matter for consideration whether in the course of conversation with the French Ministers the situation of Holland should not be &quot;   - &apos; &apos; mentioned.)(iv) A declaration to the effect that the violations of the frontiers ofBelgium and France, as dealt with in Part 3 of Article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno, are considered by Great Britain to apply equally to violations by air as well as by land.(/) The French Ministers may argue that, while grateful for the proposal to interpret our obligations under the Locarno Treaty in the case of flagrant attack as involving instant aid, this immediate response involves regular consultations between the General Staffs of Great Britain, France and Belgium. They may say that in no other way could our promise of prompt action be effective. The question raises serious domestic issues, especially as (unlike the case before the war) such arrangements for consultation could not be kept secret. Indeed, if we decided to agree, it would be important that Germany should know. I have some reason to think that the French Ministers will raise this point at the impending interview and it is very desirable that we should be prepared to deal with it. In paragraph 16 of CP. 302 (34) it is suggested that the possibility of such consultations can only be taken into account if no agreement with Germany is found to be possible. I am afraid, however, that the French will not be satisfied with such a.suggestion and will urge that such consultations should constitute in their view an integral part of any general agreement for legalising Germany&apos;s armaments. Moreover, if we were prepared to assume this commitment in the event of a definite break with Germany, ought we not to be ready to assume it as part and parcel of .; an agreement with Germany, since the likelihood of our being called upon to implement it would be greatly reduced by such an agreement ?J.
