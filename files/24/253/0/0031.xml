rj if? -jSDOCW&quot;35).vnerrp IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENToCopy No, 3$C A B I N E T. MEMORANDUM BY THE MIN1STER OF TRANSPORT,; RESTRICTION CP RTBBON DSVElPI-WENT BILL.As a result of consideration of the joint memorandum by the Minister of Health and myself (C.P.259(34)) of the 16th November, 1934, we obtained the authority of the Cabinet to draft a Bill dealing with the control of ribbon development, en the understanding that the scope of the Bill actually to be introduced should be the subject of further consideration by the Cabinet.     We pointed out that one reason for adopting this course was that the position might be altered if approval were given to proposals then under examination at my Instance for the transfer to the Minister of Transport of direct responsibility for a substantial number of the more important roads in the country, and that if it were possible to introduce a Bill on this subject in the present session there might be advantages in combining both proposals in a single measure.TRUNK ROADS AS A NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. 2,     Since that time a scheme for transferring from the county councils to the Ministry of Transport administrative and financial responsibility for about 4,000 miles of the main national routes has been elaborated, and the considerations which arise in connexion with such a scheme are set out in a memorandum by the Treasury, the Ministry of Health, the Scottish Office and the Ministry of Transport.      The arguments are, in my opinion, conclusively in favour of such a proposal. v The independent control of 1,400 highway authorities, acting within the limits of local vision, foresight and resources, is primarily responsible for the disappointing return which we get for the large sums annually spent on our highways if that return be
judged in terms of national communications.     Those communications should &quot;be efficient from the point of view of traffic, safe in so far as safety is possible, and contribute towards, instead of ruining, the amenity of town and country. If v/e assumed direct control and financial responsibility for the h,000 miles of trunk roads (which are national as opposed to local) we could at once stem the growth of the evils of ribbon development on those roads.     Furthermore the councils might be expected to apply such relief as they would obtain from the burden of maintaining these roads towards the cost of safeguarding   .and improving other roads and, by bo d^ing, check the growth of possible ribbon development on reads which are not placed under my direct control.3. Such a transfer would., however, raise important questions, including that of consequential adjustments of the block grant, and while I should have preferred, fram the point cf view of traffic and effective control of development, that any legislation naw introduced should include the proposal to transfer the trunk roads,  I have agreed with the Chancellor cf the Exchequer to recommend that a statement should be made on behalf of the Government announcing our intention to take the local authorities into consultation wit]; a view to such transfer in connection with the next revision of the bl^ck grant and local contributions in 1957*PROPOSED RESTRICTION OF RIBBON DEVELOPMENT BILL.If the Cabinet will approve this course,  I shall be in a position to circulate at once a Bill dealing with the restriction of ribbon development (a) by generalising the provisions of the existing Surrey Act, and (b) by new provisions,5. Limited powers cf restriction without compensation.      The new provisions will form the first clause of the Bill.     They will enable a highway authority,, or in its default the Minister*to
require that the land adjoining any classified road (and certain other important roads) may, up to Soft, on each side from the middle of the road he safeguarded against any new building, ands when development is pending.be taken for the purpose of subsidiary roads or other improvement of the highway.      In either event no title is given for compensation for injurious affection or otherwise, but exemption from the provisions of the clause would be given in the case of any property where restrictions would make economic development impossible.This is designed to meet the case of the land-owner who is damnified by the restrictions and obtains no compensating advantages.     Power is, however, given to reject claims for exemption, where the ground for exemption is based on a sub-division of the property effected since the zero date of l^th February, 1935.6. The main justification for admitting no claim forinjurious affection and for paying no compensation when the land is taken into the highway is tj be found in the fact that the new buildings themselveb, and the traffic, moving or stationary, v/hich they attract, create the demand for the protection and widening of the road for the use of ordinary traffic. 7. If we proceed on these lines, we must be prepared forstrong opposition from the same quarters as those which resisted the Town and Country Planning Act.      It may be argued that when powers to fix building and improvement lines were taken in the Public Health Act and the Roads Improvement Act cf 1925, provision was made for compensation for injurious affection.     On the other hand, it must be remembered that the Public Health Act of that year also gave the local authority power, if building operations   wore impending, to take without compensation any land required to bring a road up to by-law width (generally l+Oft.) and also without compensation an additional 20ft.     Moreover,
it must be recognised as fundamental that a reason why local authorities are not using the numerous and adequate powers which they already possess is the undefined and probably excessive liability to compensation which they would incur. 8. So far as now can be foreseen a maximum overall widthof 160ft.  is adequate to provide a through route cf the most modern construction of separate up and down through roads separated by a grass strip with separate up and down subsidiary (service) roads for vehicles requiring to stop to set down or pick up passengers or goods,  as well as   adequate up and dawn footpaths and cycle tracks.     At the same time there may be unforeseen developments which will necessitate a revision of that maximum and I propose therefore to take power to prescribe a greater overall width, subject to laying the necessary Regulation before Parliament.9. The object of these provisions, which will be applicableto the gr ater part of the roads not yet developed, is to enable highway authorities to secure that a limited sterilised area is not built upon but remains available if need arises for use as a subsidiary road at a later date.      In the meanwhile the use of the land for agricultural purposes will not be disturbed.   &apos; 10. As no compensation will be payable, it is reasonablesuppose that the highway authorities will make a sufficiently energetic use of their powers to prevent further destruction of the traffic value of roads by bad development.11.   Voider powers of restriction, subject to compensation.    Apart from the opposition which the foregoing proposals are likely to excite, they are likely to be criticised by such bodies as the Council for the Preservation^ of Rural England as Inadequate in that they will not give the highway authority control over a sufficient olepth of land to protect amenities.     Many existing roads of adequate width and equipped with subsidiary service
r-pads afford striking examples of unsightly development.     It would therefore appear to he necessary,  in addition to providing these limited powers, to confor generally upon highway authorities the powers already obtained by Surrey, Middlesex and Essex, and now being sought also by Hertfordshire, which give control, on terms of paying compensation, over the use of land cn either side ?.f roads declared to be main thoroughfares to a depth of 200,ft. from the boundary of the road,  or approximately three times the depth provided under the more restricted powers just described.12. The material points in which the generalised powers will differ from the private Acts are -(i) The powers of Surrey and Middlesex are limited to certain specified roads.     The Essex Act extends to all county roads subject to certain specified exceptions.    (All these Acts and the Hertfordshire Bill refer to all future county roads) Po^er is now proposed to be given in relation to all existing or proposed classified roads, and such other roads as the council, with, the approval of the Minister^ may certify as requiring restriction of ribbon development for the purpose of providing adequate and safe passage for &quot;   traffic.(ii) While provision for compensation for injurious affection is retained the arbitrator is to have regard to the new frontage created by the provision of a subsidiary road.Compensation is to be based upon conditions existing atAthe zero hour of 15th February, 1935*(iii) The Local Acts include elaborate provisions with regardto the giving of notice to every individual owner, lessee or occupier who might be affected.,      It is proposed to require notice to be given to the occupier and owner as recorded for Income Tax Schedule A purposes, and advertisement in two newspapers circulating in the area. -*-3. I propose also to generalise the power alreadypossessed by Essex, Surrey and Middlesex tc buy a furlong strip
on either side of the road.     As the wide powers of this clause are designed to preserve amenities rather than to provide additional traffic facilities, the exercise of compulsory powers is made subject to the approval of the Minister of Health.111. General.    The proposals in the Bill do not carry out the suggestion which is urged in some quarters that Parliament should at once automatically forbid all further building along all main roads and certain other roads.     This would involve a flood of applications for consent or exemption with which the competent authority might not be able to deal, otherwise than in a wholesale fashion which might defeat the object in view, and indeed such a proposal would probably lead to a demand for a postponement of the operation of the Act.The procedure contemplated is that it will be necessary for the highway authority to pass specific resolutions relating to the individual roads for which they wish to secure   a   width of not more than 1$0 feet or the wider protection to &quot;be afforded to roads declared to be main thoroughfares.     With the simplified procedure as to notice it is not thought that this course should give rise to any unreasonable delay.15* In other respects my proposals should go far towards meeting the views of the County Councils&apos; Association and, I hope, those of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England. These bodies recognise that the powers conferred by the Planning Acts are not proving effective owing to the slowness of the machinery and fear of the potential liability for compensation of uncertain amount.16. The problem of ribbon development is not confined to county areas.     With the great enlargement of boundaries effected under the Local Government Act, 1929, there are today many areas still of a rural character&quot; within the boundaries of county boroughs.     Accordingly it is proposed to confer powers not only on County Councils but also upon County Borough Councils.
17. No representations have been made to me with regardto Scotland, &quot;but it will presumably be convenient to take powers extending over the whole of Great Britain, especially if, as I hope, this will not necessitate a separate Bill,     On this point I am in communication with the Secretary of State frr Scotland.18. There is another matter upon which further powers wouldbe useful.     The obstruction of urban streets is often serious and I should like to empower local authorities themselves to provide garages and to require persons erecting new buildings to provide for the accommodation of the traffic frequenting them. I propose to include provisions of this nature which would materially assist in reducing road congestion and also be in the interest of greater safety upon the roads, if the scope of the Bill will not thereby be unduly enlarged.
SUMMARY.19.    I seek the authority of the Cabinet (1) To circulate a Bill -(a) enabling highway authorities to take the limited powers described in paragraphs 5 to 10 of this memorandum without incurring liability for compensation;(b) conferring generally upon highway authorities powers similar to those contained in the existing Private Acts, but In a simplified and strengthened form (paragraphs 11-12).     These powers could be used In addition to powers under (a), but Involve liability for compensation;(c) giving all highway authorities the powers now possessed by Middlesex to purchase land within 220 yards from the centre of any road within their area for the purposes of preserving amenities (paragraph 13); and(d) If practicable, enabling local authorities to provide garages and to require the provision of accommodation In connection with new buildings (paragraph 18).(2) To consult confidentially the County Councils and other highway associations upon the draft of the Bill before its terms are finally settled,(&apos;3) In Introducing the Bill, to make a statement on behalf of the Government in terms to be agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, announcing the Government&apos;s intention to consult with the local authorities with a view to the transfer of selected roads of national importance from highway authorities to the Minister of Transport upon the occasion of the statutory revision in 1937 of the block grant and local contributions.(Initialled)   L. H-B. 1st February. 1935.
