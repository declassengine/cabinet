IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Fob some years when the Votes of the Defence Services have been debated in the House of Commons, the suggestion has been made that their consideration should be preceded by a Debate on Imperial Defence as a whole. The Government have always been sympathetic to this proposal, but owing to the limitations of the parliamentary time-table, they have not found it possible hitherto to adopt it. In the present year the case for some such procedure is stronger than it was in past years, for the reason that the course of events has rendered unavoidable an increase in the total Defence Estimates, and it is hoped to be able to provide an opportunity for the discussion of Imperial Defence. The following notes are circulated, not to supersede the White Papers accompanying the Estimates of the Defence Departments, but in order to indicate generally the policy of the Government in Imperial Defence, and the reasons for the increase.I.2. The establishment of peace on a permanent footing has long been the principal aim of British foreign policy. The first and strongest line of defence of the people&quot;^ territories, cities, overseas trade and communications of the British Empire is provided by the maintenance of peace. If war can be banished from the world, these vast and world-wide interests will remain free from the dangers of external attack, and the great work of civilisation and trade will proceed unhampered by the fears that have hindered their progress from the earliest recorded times until to-day. That is why every British Government is bound to use its utmost endeavours to maintain peace.3. In recent years the chief methods by which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have pursued the establishment of peace on a permanent footing have been as follows  (1) By unswerving support of the League of Nations, which His Majesty &apos;s Government in the United Kingdom regard as essential machinery for promoting the preservation of peace by the facilitating -and regularising of the means of international co-operation.(2) By the promotion, in co-operation with other nations, of international instruments designed to produce collective security and a sense of security among the nations. - Among the more important may be mentioned.: (a) The Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928 for the renunciation by -every signatory of war as an instrument of policy.
(b) The Quadruple Pacific Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty-regarding the Par East, both designed to promote peace in that area and in the Pacific.(c) The Locarno Treaties, designed, by a system of mutual guarantee, to maintain the peace in those countries of Western Europe, to the situation of which this country has never been and can never be indifferent.The latest development in this direction is the Anglo-French proposal of the 3rd February for regional and mutual arrangements to deter aerial aggression and thereby provide attacks from the air.(d) Various proposals for increasing security in Eastern Europe and the Danube Basin, with special reference to the maintenance of the independence and integrity of Austria. These involve no military commitments, direct or indirect, by this country.(3) By efforts to promote international understanding in general, and in particular to bring bach into the comity of nations the ex-enemy countries. Successive Governments in the United Kingdom have taken a leading part in such measures as the suspension of the Penalties provisions of the Treaty of Versailles; the election of ex-enemies to membership of the League of Nations, including, in the case of Germany, permanent membership of the Council; the evacuation of the Rhineland five years in advance of the date fixed by the Treaties; the gradual rationalisation and virtual settlement of reparations at the Lausanne Conference of 1932; the Saar plebiscite; the action in connection with the Disarmament Conference referred to below in (4).(4) The reduction and limitation of international armaments in order to promote the work of pacification and steadily to reduce the means of making war. The best known instances of disarmament are the Washington Treaty of 1922 and the London Naval Treaty of 1930, both of which are to form the subject of an International Conference during the present year. After six years of preparation the Disarmament Conference, promoted by the League of Nations, opened at Geneva on the 2nd February, 1932, and ever since the present Government have sought unremittingly to obtain a successful result. In pursuit of this object they have been foremost among the nations in taking the initiative as, for example, to mention only a few instances, their declaration in connection with Germany&apos;s claim to equality of rights, of the 17th November, 1932 (Cmd. 4189); the British draft Convention of the 16th March, 1933 (Cmd. 4279), and their proposals of January 1934 (Cmd. 4498).4. Hitherto, in spite of innumerable setbacks, public opinion in this country has tended to assume that the international machinery for the maintenance of peace can be absolutely relied on, and that we can gradually dispense with the older methods on which we have hitherto depended for our security in the last resort. The force of world events,  however,  has shown that  these  assumptions  are
premature, and that sustained efforts will be required over a long period of time before this stage is reached. Nations vary in their temperaments, needs and state of civilisation. Some are resentful at past misfortunes, or harbour the desire to recover their losses, or seek new fields of expansion, owing to increase in population or other causes, and it must not be forgotten, in this last connection, that the United Kingdom and the rest of the British Empire are, perhaps, more fortunately placed than anyone else. All are suffering, in varying degrees, from the economic pressure of the times, which is itself due to human folly in the past. Events in various parts of the world have shown that nations are still prepared to use or threaten force under the impulse of what they conceive to be a national necessity, and that once action has been taken the existing inter-national machinery for the maintenance of peace cannot be counted upon to provide an adequate protection.5. The National Government intends to pursue without intermission the national policy of peace by every practicable means and to take advantage of every opportunity, and to make opportunities, to make peace more secure. But it can no longer close its eyes to the fact that a second line of defence is still required in order to secure the Empire&apos;s survival, so that it may continue to play its full part in maintaining the peace of the world.II.6. During the years that all parties in this Country have been seeking to carry out the policy outlined above, there has been a steady decline in the effective strength of our armaments by sea and land. In the air we virtually disarmed ourselves in 1919, and, subsequently, from time to time postponed attainment of the minimum air strength regarded as necessary to our security in the face of air developments on the Continent. It is not that British Governments have neglected to keep themselves informed of the position. Every year the state of our armaments has been anxiously considered, and if risks have been run they have been accepted deliberately in pursuit of the splendid aim of permanent peace. Again and again, rather than run any risk of jeopardising some promising movement in this direction by increasing expenditure on armaments, Governments have postponed the adoption of measures that were required when considered from the point of view of national defence alone. In this way we have taken risks for peace, but, as intimated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the debate on the address on the 28th November, 1934, &quot; disarming ourselves in advance, by ourselves, by way of an example has not increased our negotiating power in the Disarmament discussions at Geneva.&quot;7. Parliament and people, however, have been warned again and again by Ministers and other public men that serious deficiencies were accumulating in all the Defence Services; that our armaments
could not be maintained at their present level, and that unilateral disarmament could not be pursued indefinitely.III.8.   Last midsummer the position was as follows : (.1) The Disarmament Conference, though still in existence, had virtually come to a standstill, and there was no reasonable prospect that any measure of international disarmament was likely to result without prolonged negotiations,, the issue of which could not be foreseen. It was clear that these negotiations would be hampered by very serious difficulties that had arisen in recent years both in Europe and elsewhere, and by the fact that Japan and Germany had both given notice of their withdrawal from the League of Nations; while Germany, in addition, had left the Disarmament Conference.(2) A mass of evidence had made clear Germany&apos;s intention to re-arm on a large scale, and not least in the air, despite the provisions of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. All the larger Powers, except the United Kingdom, had adopted measures of re-armament and were in different stages of putting them into execution.(3) Detailed examination prolonged over many months had been made into the serious deficiencies that had accumulated in our defence forces and defences. It had been estab-lished that unless a programme was put in hand to recondition them and bring them up-to-date, the country and the Empire would no longer possess an adequate standard of defence. And if, unhappily, in spite of all our efforts to keep the peace an aggression should take place directed against ourselves, we should be incapable of keeping open our sea communications, or of feeding our people or of defending our Capital and our principal cities and their population against the menace of air attack. Much less should we be in a position to fulfil our obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Locarno Treaties, or to take effective part in any system of collective security.9. In the above circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that they would be failing in their responsibilities if, while continuing to the full, efforts for peace by limitation of armaments, they delay the initiation of steps to put our own armaments on a footing to safeguard us &quot;against potential dangers. A co-ordinated programme has been drawn up for re-conditioning our defence forces and defences. In the case of the Navy (whose strength in certain respects is at present limited by Treaty) and Army, these programmes involve for the most part a process of making good technical deficiencies, [11178] k3     &apos;
providing up-to-date equipment and adequate personnel and reserves of war material, without which our forces would be helpless either to defend our most vital -interests against an aggressor or to eo-bperate in any system of collective security by sea, land or air.10. In the case of the Royal Air Force alone were any appreciable increases of units deemed immediately necessary, and for this reason they were announced in Parliament on the 19th July, 1934, and debated by the House of Commons on the 30th July, and by the House of Lords on the 14th November. Increases will also be necessary in the anti-aircraft defences provided by the Army.11. On the 28th November, 1934, His Majesty&apos;s Government drew public attention to the re-armament which Germany has undertaken, and announced a speeding up of the increases in the Air Force already announced. The action of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment did not, of course, imply condonation of a breach of the Treaty of Versailles. It merely noted and made public, as a first step, what was known to be proceeding. This re-armament, if continued at its present rate, unabated and uncontrolled, will aggravate the existing anxieties of the neighbours of Germany, and may consequently produce a situation where peace will be in peril.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted and welcomed the declarations of the leaders of Germany that they desire peace. They cannot, however, fail to recognise that not only the forces but the spirit which these leaders are organising among the popula-tion, and especially the youth of the country; lend colour to, and substantiate, the general feeling of insecurity which they have already and incontestably generated. Anxiety in turn reflects itself in the armaments of other countries.IV.13. If peace should be broken, the Navy becomes the first line of defence for the maintenance of our essential sea communications. Our special problems of defence arise firstly, from the dependence of this country for its existence on seaborne supplies of food and raw materials, and secondly, from the unique conditions of the British Empire, its world-wide distribution, and the fact that all parts of it are, to a greater or less extent, dependent on eommunica-tions by sea for their well-being, or in some instances for their very existence; furthermore, in the last resort, it is on the transport of adequate forces and their supplies by sea that the different parts of the Empire rely to resist aggression and to ensure the security of their interests and the integrity of their territory.Thus it is that the security by sea passage to this country, as well as to and from all parts of the Empire, forms the basis and foundation of our system of Imperial defence, without which all other measures can be of but little avail.
14. So long as the Navy is strong enough to perform this task, and the other defence services are equipped to co-operate in the defence of ports and of the narrow seas, our food supplies will be safeguarded; the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations will be able to render each other mutual support to the extent that each may decide, and the trade of the different parts of the Empire, both with one another and with the rest of the world, will be maintained. Failure to make sufficient provision for the Navy and the other Defence Services will, in the event of war, reduce supplies to the point of starvation, render impossible mutual support within the Empire, lead to a cessation of trade, and inflict incalculable suffering on the community.15. Developments in the power and range of air forces have increased the vulnerability of this country in certain circumstances, but this is an added burden of defence, and when it has been faced and shouldered, the protection of the sea communications of these Islands as well as of the rest of the Empire remains. While also the growing power of air forces has increased the efficiency and range of shore defences, our merchant ships on the vast ocean spaces are still open to naval attack. The principles of naval defence remain therefore unaltered.16. The Main Fleet is the basis upon which our naval strategy rests, but the cover it can provide is rarely complete, and it may always be expected that detached enemy units may evade the Main Fleet and carry out sporadic attacks on territories and trade. To deal with these attacks, considerable numbers of cruisers are required over and above those forming part of the Main Fleet.17. In the Main Fleet the capital ship remains the essential element upon which the whole structure of our naval strategy depends. The age of our battleships, however, together with this and other factors, renders it necessary to commence their replace-ment at an early date. The advent of air attack in its present form was unforeseen when our battleships were designed; but the anti-aircraft armament of the present ships is being increased to enable them to perform their primary function.18. The strength of the Navy, as already mentioned, is at present fixed by the Washington and London Naval Treaties which are due for reconsideration this year. Divergencies in national points of view have developed since the negotiation of those treaties, as evidenced by the recent notice by Japan to terminate the Washington Treaty, and by the programmes effected and contem-plated by some of the European Powers. Much will therefore depend on the next naval conference and on the ability of all concerned to translate into action the. undoubted desire for a satisfactory international settlement.19. It is the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure an arrangement that will avoid competition in naval armaments whilst
leaving us free to maintain a fleet at the minimum strength necessary for our absolute requirements. This involves a calculation of the number of ships of each type which together make up the fleet, and it is essential that the minimum numbers so calculated should be maintained. It is equally essential that our fleet should be kept up to date in all respects, including a sufficient and highly trained personnel, adequate provision of aircraft (which are becoming more and more important to the Navy), the most modern weapons, repair facilities, and the necessary reserves of fuel, ammunition and stores of all kinds at convenient bases. Without these facilities, or if at the outbreak of war our ships are less well equipped than those of the enemy, our fleets may be unable to fulfil their tasks and our ships may suffer destruction.V.20. The bases and fuelling stations of the Fleet and the harbours where merchant ships are loading and unloading require defences against sea-borne and air attack on scales that vary with their geographical position and the other circumstances of each port. Without these defences, the docks, repair facilities, fuel, stores, as well as merchant ships in port, would be liable to destruction by an enemy, and the action of the Fleet might be paralysed.21. At the present time the defences of our ports are inadequate and out of date. Under, modern conditions the defence of ports involves concerted action between the three Services, but the heaviest expenditure falls on War Office votes.22. The Army estimates, besides providing for the improvement and installation of coast defences on a considered scale of priority, make provision for the large expansion of the anti-aircraft defences which are a necessary corollary to the increase in our air forces. In addition, the mobile forces require to be brought up to the standard of a modern army by the provision of modern equipment, mechanisa-tion, transport and reserves of war material of all kinds which have fallen below modern standards. If these essentials are not provided, our Army may one day be called on to go into action with inferior equipment and a totally inadequate reserve of ammunition, and to submit to heavy loss, suffering and possible disaster which might have been avoided by reasonable foresight and expenditure.VI.23. The Royal Air Force has, as its principal role, to provide (with the co-operation of ground defences) for the protection of the United Kingdom and particularly London against air attack. It also provides Air Forces for general defence purposes in the Middle East, India and the Far East, as well as for co-operation in Coast Defence (a subject which is being closely studied by the three Defence
Services in co-operation at the present time); and, in addition, furnishes specially trained and equipped squadrons for co-operation with the Army and a proportion of the Fleet Air Arm personnel for work with the Navy. The Air Squadrons at home provide, in addition, a reserve of air squadrons for employment in any part of the world in an emergency.24. Technical development in the air is taking place very rapidly in respect, for example, of such matters as speed, height, endurance, carrying capacity and potentialities for destruction. The range of territory on the continent of Europe from which air attacks could be launched against this country is constantly extending and will continue to extend; and if, in war, an enemy were in possession of the countries bordering the Channel, the area of Great Britain liable to his attacks would be still further increased. The weight of the attack would be much greater, owing.to the quicker &quot;turn round&quot; of the bombers and their increased bomb load at shorter ranges. The increase in speed, range and height accentuates the difficulty of obtaining warning in time to bring defensive aircraft into action in favourable conditions to repel attacks. For these reasons the importance of the integrity of certain territories on the other side of the Channel and North Sea, which for centuries has been, and still remains, a vital interest to this country from a Naval point of view, looms larger than ever when air defence is also taken into consideration.2-5. If adequate forces for air defence were not provided, the only deterrent to a sufficiently armed aggressor would be a moral one, and no effective means of defence or counter-attack would be available to us. In view of the time required to provide the necessary defensive forces, and the obscurities .of the international situation, no Government mindful of its responsibilities could neglect to provide such defence as it deemed necessary to secure the safety of the country.26. As was stated in the House of Commons on the 30th July, 1934, His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to develop, simultaneously with the active air defence of this country, a system of passive air defence for the protection of the civilian population. Corresponding action has already been taken by most of the countries on the continent of Europe, and, by common consent of all those who have studied the subject, this is an essential complement to defensive measures in order to reduce, so far as possible, the inevitable losses and suffering that must result from air attack.27. It would as yet be premature to forecast what may be the ultimate effect on our armaments of the Anglo-French proposals of the 3rd February. But it is desired to emphasise that the measures now proposed are elastic. They will not only be subject to frequent review in the light of prevailing conditions, but may from time to
time be adjusted in either direction if circumstances should, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, warrant any change.28. Plis Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced, and they believe that all thinking and unprejudiced fellow countrymen having the cause of peace at heart will agree, that the influence of the United Kingdom as a stabilising force in the councils of the world could only be weakened by the knowledge that the United Kingdom was no longer in a position to defend herself, to fulfil her responsibilities towards the rest of the Empire, to honour her agreements, or to perform her part as a member of the League of Nations. It is to avoid these conditions that the defensive programmes of the Defence Departments, which have been concerted in common, and an instalment of which will appear in their estimates for 1935-36, have been designed.February 14, 1935.Wt.-50 2/35 K.O.P. 11178 gp. 340
