THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the. Cabinet.   January 1935..SECRET. Copy No.C!.P. 10 (35).CABINET.HERRING INDUSTRY BOARD BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Home Secretary.IN accordance with the Conclusions of the Cabinet at their Meeting on the &apos; 19th December (Cabinet 47 (34), Conclusion 13) we circulate a new Bill dealing with the Herring Industry.2. In order to conform with the decision of the Cabinet the provision for the preparation of the scheme by Ministers which was in the previous Bill is omitted.3.   Clause 1 of the new Bill provides for the establishment of the Herring Board with 3 independent and 5 trade members.4. Clause 2 provides that the Herring Board itself, after consultation with the Industry, should prepare the Scheme for the reorganisation, development and regulation of the Industry and should submit it to the Ministers and that the Ministers should be satisfied that the Scheme is in accordance with the prevailing opinion of the Industry before they ask Parliament to approve it. The Clause also provides for publication of notice of the Scheme, for the consideration of objections and for the making of modifications with the assent of the Board; these provisions were not in the previous Bill. The concurrence of the Treasury and of the Board of Trade is also required before any Scheme is laid before Parliament.5. Clause 3 supplements the general power in Clause 2 that the Scheme may provide for the reorganisation, development and regulation of the Industry by indicating specific matters which may be contained in the Scheme. This Clause takes the place of the detailed statement of powers in the former Bill and we have been advised that it has the advantage of minimising the risk of challenge in the Courts to the effect that particular provisions in the Scheme were not contemplated by the Act. It also meets the objection that might be taken in Parliament to a general power in the form of an exceptionally &apos;&apos; blank cheque.&quot;6. Clause 4 provides for the protection of the consumer, and also enables the Ministers to refer the working of the Scheme to the Committee of Investigation under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, and if necessary to amend its provisions or to bring it to an end. These safeguards were not contained in the previous Bill.7. We have examined the suggestion that the operation of the Act should be limited in the first instance to twelve months, but we are convinced that this would be very undesirable, since.one year would be too short a period to test the Scheme, and the limitation might make it very difficult to get the best choice of men for the Board, which would start its work in an atmosphere of discouragement.8.   The remaining Clauses of the Bill relate to offences, finance and machinery, and are substantially the same as the corresponding clauses in the previous Bill, except that the penalties for offences have been reduced.

9. While the Board itself is the creation of the Government, we are satisfied that the responsibility for the initiation and administration of the Scheme now rests on the Board. Admittedly a Scheme under this Bill will confer wide powers on the Board. But the Report of the Sea-fish Commission showed that such measures were necessary. We recognise that there will be criticism of the Bill on the general ground that it confers wide and drastic powers. But we would emphasise the necessity that has been shown for such legislation in this instance. The arguments for proceeding with the Bill are that the state of the Herring Industry has been deteriorating steadily for several years, that two months after the publication of the Commission^ Report the representatives of twenty-five sections of the Industry unanimously asked us to establish a Board with the powers recommended in the Report, and that the Industry&apos;s present plight will make it difficult for the Government to ignore the recurrent demands for help which have arisen recently and will continue to arise. If we do not proceed with the Bill in time to have the Scheme in early operation, the Government will, we fear, be saddled with the responsibility for failure to take action, and will be asked to give financial assistance without any return in the shape of reorganisation.10. We should add that, although it has not been found possible to hold a meeting with the Ministers with whom we were requested to confer, the new draft of the Bill has been referred to them in advance. As a result, some modifications have been embodied in the annexed draft to meet certain points raised by the Secretary of State for War, although we recognise that these modifications are without prejudice to the views which he may desire to express on general questions when the matter comes before the Cabinet.11. We accordingly ask for authority to circulate the Bill in its revised form in order that progress may be made as soon as possible after Parliament meets.(Initialled)      G. P. C.W. E. E. J.
