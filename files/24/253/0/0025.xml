THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1935.SECEET Copy No.CP. 25 (35).CABINET.PALESTINE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WITH reference to my Memorandum (CP. 256 (34)), which was considered by the Cabinet on the 28th November, 1934, I circulate for the information of my colleagues (i) A copy of the despatch which I sent to the High Commissioner forPalestine, summarising the conclusions reached in recent discussions with me and conveying the views of the Cabinet on those conclusions, as expressed in the Minutes of the Meeting of the 28th November, 1934 (Cabinet Conclusions 43 (34)); and(ii) A copy of Sir A. Wauchope&apos;s reply, which appears to me to be satisfactory.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, S.W. 1, January 28, 1935.ANNEX.(Secret.)Sir, Downing Street, December 6, 1934.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your secret despatch of the 25th August, and your secret despatches &quot; A &quot; and &quot; C &quot; of the same date, on the subject of the proposed Legislative Council for Palestine, and to inform you that I have given careful consideration to your comprehensive analysis of the problem and to the provisional conclusions which you have reached. I have also read with interest the account of your conversations on this subject with the President of the Moslem Council, and the memorandum by the District Commissioner, Jerusalem District.2. I took the opportunity of your recent visit to this country to discuss this matter fully with you, and I will now set out, for your guidance in forthcoming discussions with Arab and Jewish representatives, the conclusions which we reached in these discussions and which I now confirm subject to the observations made in paragraph 4 (i), (ii) and (iii).[11090] B
3.   These conclusions are as follows : (A) Form of Council.(1) The Jewish claim to &quot; parity &quot; (i.e., the same number of seats as for the Arabs) should be rejected.(2) The unofficial side of the council should be constituted as follows : Elected members(to be based as nearly as possible on gross population figures).Moslems ... ... ... ...        8Jews     ... ... ... ... ...        3Christians ... ... ... ...        112Nominated members.Moslems             ... ... ... ... 2Bedouin             ... ... ... ... 1Jews     ...          ... ... ... ... 5Christians          ... ... ... ... 2Commercial Interests ... ... ... 111(3) Apart from the High Commissioner, who would be president of the council, the official members should be limited to five, i.e.: Chief Secretary    &quot;1 Treasurer V ex officio.Attorney-General  other officials, not exceeding two, to be nominated by the High Commissioner, as&apos; required from time to time.(4) The High Commissioner should hold the office of the president of the council, but for all ordinary business he should depute the Chief Secretary to preside on his behalf.[(5) Women should not be admitted as members of the council.^](6) There should be a simple literacy test for elected members of the council(7) There should not be any nationality test.(B.) Method of Election.(1) The right to vote should be given to all persons (of appropriate age and other qualifications) who have been resident in Palestine for a stated period and can prove that they are entitled to be so resident, and a similar qualification should apply in the case of members.(2) In order to secure the desired number of elected members of each community, the communal system of voting should be adopted; that is to say, each of the three religious communities should have its own constituencies covering the whole country, the number of constituencies depending upon the number of members to which each community is entitled.(3) The &apos;&apos; direct&apos;&apos; system of voting should be adopted, unless there should be a strong demand for the &quot; indirect &quot; system of primary and secondary election; there is no apparent reason why, if different communities hold strong views on the matter, each should riot have the system it prefers.(4) Each community should be allowed to decide whether its women should have the right to vote.* As to this see particularly paragraph 4 (iii).
(C.) Powers of the High Commissioner and of the Council.(1) The High Commissioner will have the usual power to refuse his assent to a bill or to &quot; reserve &apos;&apos; it.He should also have the following powers : (i) power to ensure the passing of legislation required in the public interest;(ii) power to ensure the passing of such legislation within a time limit ifit is required urgently; (iii) power to legislate by proclamation when the Legislative Council is not in session if the public interest demands the passage of such legislation immediately.(2) All legislation, with the exception provided for in (1) (iii) above, must pass through the council.(3) The provision of the Palestine Order-in-Council of 1922 prohibiting the Legislative Council from passing bills of a certain kind (including bills repugnant to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Mandate) should be omitted in the new Order-in-Council, and it will be sufficient to provide in the Royal Instructions that the High Commissioner shall not assent to such bills.(4) No subjects should be excluded from discussion in the Legislative Council, but it should be provided, as usual, that no vote, resolution, or ordinance for the appropriation of any part of the revenue, or for the imposition of any tax or impost, should be proposed, except by the High Commissioner or by his direction.(5) The High Commissioner in Council should be given power (preferably by the Customs Tariff Ordinance) to impose or vary customs duties, subject to confirmation by the Legislative Council within a stated period.(6) The High Commissioner in Council should also have power to restrict clearances from bond.(7) Consideration should be given to the desirability of providing in the Royal Instructions in strong and comprehensive terms that the High Commis-sioner should regard the welfare, &amp;c, of officials as a special charge.(D.) Payment of Members. This question was left over for your further consideration.(E) Jewish Agency.The claim of the Jewish Agency to be consulted before any bill is introduced into the Legislative Council should be refused, and there should be no departure from present practice in the matter of consultation between the High Commissioner and that body.4. Since your return to Palestine the conclusions which are summarised above have been discussed by the Cabinet, who have expressed their general concurrence and have agreed that you should be authorised to proceed with negotiations on these lines. I have, however, been asked to invite a further expression of your views on the following points :-- (i) It has been suggested that in view of the sensitiveness of Moslem opinion m India it might be advisable slightly to increase the number of Moslem members on the council, i.e., to increase by one the nominated Moslem members.In order to avoid the difficulties which would arise if Arab members were in a majority over the rest, it would seem that the adoption of this suggestion would involve either (a) the reduction by one of the nominated Christian members or (b) an increase by one of the number of official members. I shall be glad if you will furnish me with your views on this point.(ii) I undertook to consult you with regard to a suggestion that the functions of the Legislative Council should be more precisely defined and, in particular, that questions affecting religion should be excluded from discussion.(iii) The opinion has been most strongly expressed that it would be most undesirable to provide in the Constitution that women are to be excluded from membership of the council, in view of the present state of public opinion in this[11090] b 2
country and elsewhere. I fully share this view and, unless, as I hope, you can see your way to omit this feature of the scheme, i shall be glad if you will consult me before making any statement on the subject.5. I have discussed with you your proposal to nominate a certain number of unofhcials as members of the Executive Council. i am prepared to approve of this proposal in principle, and i understand that you will wish so to nominate one Arab and one Jewish representative, and possibly a representative of commercial or other interests, who will not be a Jew or an Arab. I have also informed you that I would deprecate the acceptance of any demand that unofficial members of the Executive Council should be elected. I would, however, suggest for your consideration that you will be well advised to nominate the unofficial members of the Executive Council as members of the Legislative Council, in order that the benefit of their moderating influence in the latter body may not be lost. You will no doubt furnish me in due course with your detailed recommendations in connection with the proposal to admit unofficial members to the Executive Council.6.. I have to add that, in requesting a further expression of your views on the particular points mentioned in paragraph 4 of this despatch, I have no desire to preclude consideration of any modifications of other features of the scheme which you may wish to propose after further examination of the matter in Palestine. i understand, however, that you will not deviate in any essential from the provisional conclusions which have been reached without prior consultation with me.I have, &amp;c.P. CUNLIEFE-LISTER.High Commissioner,Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wauchope, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., &amp;c,       &amp;c,       &amp;c.(ii)(Secret.) High Commissioner for Palestine,Sir, - Jerusalem, January 8, 1935.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch of the 6th December, informing me that the conclusions reached in our recent discussions on the subject of the proposed Legislative Council for Palestine have now been generally concurred in by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Of the various suggestions upon which my observations are invited in paragraph 4 of your despatch, the first, namely, the desirability of slightly increasing the proposed Moslem representation on the Council,, has my full sympathy, and I shall endeavour to give it effect. As you have yourself recognised, it will not be possible to increase the number of elected Moslems since this number is directly related to the numerical proportion of the three principal communities of Palestine; and, in parenthesis, i might mention, since i understand that the figures of population upon which the communal proportions are based have been called into question, that these figures are not taken from the Census of 1931, but represent the estimated figures of the population of the communities concerned as they exist to-day. The estimate has been prepared by the Commissioner of Migration and Statistics, who conducted the 1931 Census, and i have no reason to think that it is otherwise than reliable.3. Consequently, any increase of Moslem representation must necessarily be in respect of nominated members, and, as you point out, it would probably involve either an equivalent reduction of Christian nominated members or increase of official members (or presumably of non-Arab members). i am reluctant to add to the total numbers of the proposed Council, if this can be avoided. A Council of 28 members is already, in my opinion, sufficiently large, and I should hesitate to recommend any expansion. On the other hand, there are objections to reducing the Christian element in the Council, which, i am inclined
to think, is no more than sufficient to ensure adequate representation of a com-munity whose influence in commerce and in the public administration is out of proportion to its numerical strength, and is, moreover, generally exercised on the side of moderation. I should, therefore, prefer to reserve my opinion as to the precise method of securing an increase in Moslem representation until a later stage in my negotiations in Palestine. I assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be satisfied with a relative increase of Moslems, that is to say an increase relatively to Jewish representation, provided, of course, that this did not involve the creation of an Arab majority on the Council. For example, it might be desirable to reduce the number of Jewish nominated members from five to four, and to increase from one to two the representation of commercial interests, leaving the figures of Moslem and Christian nominated members unaltered. But, as I have said, I should prefer not to give a final recommendation on this point until my conversations with leaders have begun. I shall not commit myself to anything definite on this point without previous consultation with you.4. With regard to the suggestion in paragraph 4 (ii) of your despatch under reply, i assume that a closer definition of the functions of the Legislative Council will in any case be needed for incorporation in the legislation which will be required in order to bring that body into being. But, as at present advised, I cannot recommend that in any such definition questions affecting religion should be expressly excluded from discussion in the Legislative Council. You will recollect that the desirability of excluding certain subjects from the purview of the Legislative Council was fully examined during our recent discussions in London, and that the conclusion then reached was that the disadvantages of such a course, including the practical difficulty of defining precisely what should be excluded, outweighed the advantages. i still adhere to that view; and, as regards the particular suggestion on which you have consulted me, I would point out that, if the Legislative Council were given no authority to consider matters relating to religion, it would be impossible to consult that body on the subject of the reorganisation of the Supreme Moslem Council, in regard to which the views of the elected and nominated members of the Moslem community would be of particular value.5. i observe from paragraph 4 (iii) that the view has been strongly expressed that it would be undesirable to exclude women from membership of the Legislative Council. i do not anticipate that for many years to come the Moslem community of Palestine will elect or will be content to see nominated to the Council any Moslem women members. For that and other reasons I should have preferred to wait till the second election before conferring the right on any woman,to sit on the Legislative Council.Such a right will certainly be displeasing both to the Arabs and traditionally religious Jews.None the less, in view of what you have now written, I will endeavour to get, if not approval, at least no strong opposition to this proposal in the course of my conversations; and I think I shall be successful. i will, of course, keep you informed before arriving at any decision.6. I am glad to learn that my proposal to add a certain number of non-officials as members of the Executive Council has been approved in principle, and I entirely agree with you that such non-official members should be nominated and not elected. Although i still feel that the presence of non-official members in the Executive Council, particularly if such members were also, as you suggest, members of the Legislative Council, would have great advantages, i also recognise that it would be open to serious objections, not least of which would be the difficulty that would arise if one of the members, whether Arab or Jew, were to resign from the Executive Council on some controversial issue. In such event, if the issue were inter-racial and of sufficient importance to be widely canvassed, i might have difficulty in finding another suitable representative of the community concerned willing to be nominated in place of the resigning member, whereas, if no new nomination were made, the community would be left without a member in Executive Council, and would, in consequence, feel aggrieved. Consequently, i shall await my forthcoming conversations with Arab and Jewish leaders before arriving at a final decision.
7. It is certain that there will be a number of very divergent views expressed when I start these conversations : the Jews have strong objection to the whole proposal; the Arabs will certainly raise objections on a number of points; for example, that electors should be confined to those holding Palestinian citizenship; that the proportion of nominated members should not be greater for Jews than the population basis warrants.I shall naturally endeavour to reach agreement on the lines decided on in London last October; none the less, it is possible that the conversations may bring out reasons, whether advanced by Arabs or Jews, for making certain changes. I shall, of course, as hitherto, continue to keep you fully informed of the progress of the conversations, and shall assent to no changes without first obtaining your full approval.8. Finally, I should explain that, in view of the delay which has attended the election of the new Municipal Council in Jerusalem, and thus of the fact that I have hitherto been denied an opportunity to judge of the working of the Municipal Corporations Ordinance, I shall not be in a position to open negotiations with leading personalities in Palestine upon the subject of the proposed Legislative Council for some months to come, a fact which is not without advantages.I have, &amp;c.ARTHUR WAUCHOPE,High Commissioner for Palestine.The Right Hon.Sir Philip CunliffedLister, G.B.E., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.o
