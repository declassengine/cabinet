THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1935.SECRET Copy No.    4CP. 39 (35).CABINET.MEETINGS WITH THE DOMINION PRIME MINISTERS AT THE TIME OF THE SILVER JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.) MY colleagues will remember that, when we considered last year the question of /inviting Dominion representatives to be present in this country during the time of the Jubilee celebrations, we decided (Cabinet 17 (34), Conclusion 4) that it would be inadvisable to contemplate a formal Imperial Conference in the year 1935, but that when the Prime Ministers were invited to participate in the Anniversary celebrations, we should inform them that their presence in England would enable informal discussions to take place with United Kingdom Ministers on certain important matters; one of these would naturally be the question of the date for the holding of the next Imperial Conference.2. An invitation was accordingly sent to the Prime Ministers to be the guests of the Government here during the Jubilee celebrations, and it was intimated to them that advantage could be taken of their presence to discuss, personally and informally, any questions of particular importance, especially as regards the international situation. It was added that opportunity could also be taken to discuss the question of the most convenient date for holding the next Imperial Conference.3. The position as regards the attendance of the various Prime Ministers is as follows : ; General Hertzog has indicated that he will arrive on the 29th april and will be able to remain in England until, but not later than, the 24th May.Mr. Lyons contemplates arriving in this country about the end of March, accompanied by three of his colleagues, with a view to a preliminary discussion of the economic position, especially in regard to meat. He has, however, made it clear that he alone will be remaining to attend the Jubilee celebrations officially, and that Sir Henry Gullett (the Minister in charge of Treaty negotiations), who is accompanying him to take part in the economic discussions, will be returning to Australia before the Jubilee celebrations. One of the other Ministers accompanying Mr. Lyons to England is the Commonwealth Attorney-General (Mr. Menzies), who will be staying on in London in connexion with a case before the Judicial Committee, but I imagine that the remaining one (Mr. H. V. C. Thorby, who represents the Country Party) will be returning with Sir H. Gullett.No precise indication has yet been received as to the date of arrival of Mr. Bennett or Mr. Forbes, and it is, I gather, possible that the impending General Election in Canada may prevent Mr. Bennett&apos;s attendance. Our latest information is that Mr! Forbes intends to come, but as a General Election in New Zealand is also in prospect, he will, I imagine, be unable to stay very long.Mr. Huggins, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, will also be here.Mr. de Valera, I am sorry to say, has declined the invitation.

I. 4. With a view to carrying out the Cabinet decision.&quot; against holding a formal Conference, I have endeavoured, by private representations, to ensure that the Prime Ministers only should be present for the Jubilee celebrations and should be accompanied by personal staff and not by technical advisers (it is for this reason&apos;that Mr. Lyons has arranged for Sir H. Gullett to return to Australia before the celebrations). !     :5. General Hertzog has caused informal enquiries to be made as to the agenda for the proposed discussions and, in reply to this, we have let him know that no steps have been taken to draw up anything in the nature of a formal agenda; that we had in mind that discussions should be completely informal and that, apart from the consideration of the date of the next meeting of the Imperial Conference, they should concentrate on the general international situation.6. It seems to me that the time has now come when we ought to begin to consider what arrangements we should make by way of preparation for the proposed informal discussions. The preliminary discussions with Mr. Lyons raise issues which are being considered separately. They will cover, on the one side, our treatment of Australian produce, especially meat, and, on the other side, various points which we wish to raise as to Australian tariffs on United Kingdom goods and particularly the difference of view as to the interpretation of the provisions of the Ottawa Agreement that our exporters should have &quot;full opportunity of reasonable competition.&quot; The question of migration may also come up.7. It seems to me that, apart from the question of the date of the next Imperial Conference, the principal items which we shall have to consider might be grouped as follows : (1) Questions of naval disarmament with relation to the possible holding of a Naval Disarmament Conference. (2) The Far Eastern situation.(3) The European situation, with special reference to the position ofGermany and the/uox-fc Anglo-French discussions. (4) Imperial Defence, with special reference to its relation to items (1), (2)and (3) above. (5) The question of air communications.8. There are certain problems of a more specialised character which may require to be discussed, e.g. (i) the question of German Colonial aspirations in Africa a point to whichimportance has been given as a result of recent statements by Mr. Pirow, the Union Minister of Defence. This, of course, might be considered in relation to the general question referred to under (3) above, but as it raises peculiar problems of its own it may be thought desirable to give it separate treatment.(ii) the nationality of married women.  It was indicated in a recent reply to aquestion in the Commonwealth Parliament that Mr. Lyons proposed to . discuss this subject in London this year.9. Lastly, there may, of course, be other special problems which it may be found convenient to discuss with the Dominion Prime Ministers when they arrive.10. As regards preparations for dealing with the above topics, it would certainly be convenient if we could supply the Dominion Prime Ministers on their arrival with memoranda explanatory of the situation. At the same time it seems to me that the situation is so fluid at present that it will be difficult to prepare any such memoranda very long in advance. What I should like to suggest, therefore, is that the Foreign Office should be asked to prepare memoranda on items (1) (in consultation with the Admiralty), (2) and (3), and that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to consider these memoranda with a view to preparing a report on item (4) to supplement the Report of the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements (CP^SOS-(34)), which the Cabinet have decided should be communicated to the Prime Ministers on their arrival. These preparations should be put in hand so that the memoranda could be completed just before Easter.
ANNEX.Draft Telegram to, Canada and New Zealand.(Secret.)FOLLOWING from Prime Minister for Prime Minister : &quot;We understand, in connection with Silver Jubilee celebrations this year, that Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa will arrive in London on the 29th April, that is, a week in advance of the actual celebrations. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia will already be here.&quot;It seems to us that, this being so, it might be very convenient, if it were possible, to begin informal talks (see my telegram of the 2nd May, 1934) in that week, when the time should not be so much occupied with engagements in connection with the Jubilee, and we very much hope therefore that you -    will be able to arrange your visit to London so as to be here by the 29th April.&quot;Canada, No.New Zealand, No.&apos; 11.; .As regards item (5)-air communications the position is&apos;that arrange-ments have been made for representatives of the Air Ministry and the General Post Office to visit Australia with a view to clearing up details in regard to the new air mail scheme. It is understood that New Zealand is sending represen-tatives to Australia to meet them. The position in regard to South African co-operation is still obscure, and the question of the best means of continuing the discussion with the Government of the Union is now under consideration. This subject will require further consideration in the light: of the situation existing at the time of the Prime Ministers&apos; arrival, and, in the meantime, I suggest that we need do no more than bear in mind the possibility of using the presence of the Prime Ministers to clear up any outstanding points of importance.12. On the two special problems to which I have referred in paragraph 8 above, the issues can be examined departmentally, at any rate in the first instance.I should add that there is some reason to think that General Hertzog will raise again the question of the future of the South African High Commission Territories. The position as regards these Territories is, of course, familiar to the Cabinet, and the material for any discussion with General Hertzog is ready.13. I have referred in paragraphs 3 and 6 above to the separate economic discussions with Mr. Lyons which will precede the celebrations. These discussions, in so far as they relate to primary produce, will be on subjects of interest to most of the other Dominions and to Southern Rhodesia, and it mav prove desirable that there should be some quite general discussion with the other Prime Ministers. I do not think that we can decide this definitely until the discussions with Mr. Lyons have got under way.14. There is one further suggestion which I should like to make. It will be seen from paragraph 3 above that Mr. Lyons and General Hertzog will both be in this country for a week before the Jubilee celebrations begin on the 6th May. I think it would be helpful, if it were possible, to arrange for the informal discussions with the Prime Ministers to begin during that week; the following week will be very fully occupied with the celebrations. I should like, therefore, to suggest that we might telegraph shortly to Mr. Bennett and Mr. Forbes saying that it would be convenient if they could time their arrival so as to be in this country by the 29th April. A draft&apos;of such a telegram is annexed to this memorandum.(Intd.)      J. H. T.Dominions Office, February 1935.
