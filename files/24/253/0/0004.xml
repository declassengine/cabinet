(ttjtfi pqgtment is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government). secret.c.p.4(35) copy no-..trade agreement with india on the subject of indian protective duties.although i am reluctant to believe that the attitude of lancashire as a whole towards our policy for indian constitutional reform i will be determined by the considerations stated at the end of paragraph 5 of the memorandum circulated by the president of the board of trade i am well aware of the great importance attached by lancashire to obtaining a reduction to 20% of the 2% duty on british cotton goods imported into india and i realise that, if they are disappointed in this matters the political reactions may be unfortunate.i have done all i possibly can to impress upon the viceroy and his council the seriousness of the situation at this - end.    i 8m sure they fully appreciate it, and there is no lack of goodwill on their part.   nevertheless it is well to realise that they are faced with a real and serious difficulty which may make it impossible for them to reduce the duty this year in spite of their efforts and desires.the general level of the indian tariff was raised to 2.5a in 1931 under the stress of extreme budget difficulties which continued during the three succeeding years and may prove to be not very materially lightened in 1935. the emergency budget of ,1931s which included this increase, was undertaken as a result of pressure from here-which we exerted because we took the view that it was of paramount importance to maintain indian credit by . a balanced budget. the financial measures then taken were
were certainly not more drastic than in our opinion the situation required and it was found that there was no way of escaping the necessity for raising the duty on cotton goods and other commodities in the seme tariff class to 25%. The purpose of the increase of the duty was-in no sense that of penalising or restricting British imports.The Government of India have, during the course of the recent negotiations;, formally expressed willingness to experiment with the reduction of the 25% duty on cotton goods to 20% as soon as their revenue position admits of a corresponding reduction on the bulk of the goods now paying 2% duty.   Unfortunately there is still serious doubt whether this reduction will be feasible next March in the light of the Budget position, especially as the Government of India have, with our full approval, given pledges which commit them to treat as a first charge on eny Indian revenue surplus available the removal of the emergency pay cut which still stands at 5/; and-of the surcharges on income-tax. The priority for the income tax surcharge is in the interests of the European business community in India, who were particularly hard hit by it and regard it as the counter-part of the cut on the pay of the Services,Ultimately, when the revenue position permits, the cotton duties are to be determined on the principle laid clown in the agreement of &quot;equating the price of United Kingdom goods to the fair selling price of similar goods produced in India&quot; and when this happens Lancashire should be satisfied.    In the meantime the Government of India cenriot go further tovrards satisfying Lancashire than their revenue requirements and their commitments allow. While the grievances of Lancashire in regard to the level of duties upon their own goods are being considered, it should not be overlooked that, since the date of the raising of the duties to 25%, they have got the benefit of the measures
^taken by India in regard to competitive imports of cotton goods, namely the raising of the tariff on non-British goods to 50% and the imposition of quota restrictions upon Japanese imports.I am in constant correspondence with the Viceroy on the whole subject both officially and privately and he will certainly do sll he can to help us.    In particular, I have asked him to have it most carefully considered whether the reduction of the duty would really result in any loss of revenue.    It is too early yet -for the Government of India to have been able to send home their first appreciation of the revenue and expenditure position in the coming financial year and no one can at present say whather any reduction of taxation will be found possible and if so whether it would extend to the cotton duties.Before the opening of the negotiations which have, after long delay, resulted in this agreement, I expressed the opinion that negotiations of this sort cannot be conducted as effectively by correspondence as they should be conducted, and I was in favour of a British Delegation being sent to India for the purpose0    I think that we should have had much, earlier results if this method had been adopted, and that we should have got&quot;Vbetter value out of the conclusion of the agreement if it had come earlier and more easily,   The conclusion I draw from the difficult and prolonged course of the discussions is that on any similar occasion in the future it would be a great advantage to have personal contact between the parties.7th January 1935*3.
