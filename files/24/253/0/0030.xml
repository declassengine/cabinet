(THIS DOCIJMEFJ? IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)SECRETC50 (55)cabinet india.COPY NO,few   V&quot;Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 13th February, 1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated the 13th February; 1935, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.There is little change in the political situation in the provinces, and interest during the last month has centred, on the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly.     Attempts made to celebrate &quot;Independence Day&quot; on January 26th by reading out the Independence resolution passed at the Lahore Congress, 192.9, but the meetings excited little attention and the attendance was generally small.     In Calcutta,  a meeting of only about 100 persons was broken up by a small group of young communists.      In. Bombay, representatives of the communist and socialist parties were also in evidence.There are,  in fact, some indications of a growing activity of the Congress socialist party which, although not approving of the Congress programme, are unwilling to become isolated from Congress proper,  and are ready to take part in &quot;those activities which suit their purpose.       Propaganda among tenants or labourers does not so far appear to have met with any success, but the leaders seem to be trying to find areas in which discontent exists and,  in &quot;such places,  to develop mass agitation.The development ox Mr gandhis Village Industries Association is still obscure and no definite programme has yet been formulated or at least published.      In Bengal no activity is reported;    in Madras the proposal has been put forward to hold a Swadeshi exhibition wi th a political conference;    in Bombay Congress workers appear to be devoting their attention to the discovery of grievances which can be exploited, rather than to bona fide measures of village
*) K&apos;**uplift.      In the United. Provinces there is a good deal of activity in rural areas and Kisan Sabhas (Associations of Tenants) have been revived in some districts.   Both in this. Province and in Bihar it is reported that attempts are being made to persuade cultivators;, especially those in the neighbourhood of sugar mills to manufacture &quot;Gur&quot; (Molasses) from their cane instead of selling it to factories.There is certainly as yet no reason to modify the view expressed in the Appreciation for November last that the new movement has a political objective.      In this connection,  it may be recalled that Gandhi after his release from prison in February, 1924, left the political campaign to be carried on by the Swarag party under the able leadership of Mr. C .R.Das, while he devoted himself to the organisation of the All-India Spinners1 Association.      Some interesting comments of Mr.Gan.dhi&apos;s retirement in 1924 and his nominal withdrawal from Congress this year are to be found in a book entitled &quot;The Indian Struggle&quot; 1920 to 1934 by the Bengal leader Mr. S.C. Bose, a book which is such a direct encouragement to direct action and left-wing activities,  if not to actual terrorism, that it has been banned from importation into India..     Referring to the early period, Mr. Boae wrote as follows:  &quot;Under Mr. Gandhi&apos;s leadership the All-India Spinners1 Association was extending its branches all over the country..     Through this organisation the Mahatma was once again building his own party which was to be of invaluable-service to him when he desired to capture the Congress machinery again.&quot;Referring to more recent events, he observes:&quot;today, the person of the Mahatma may not be in the Congress Committee but his party is there stronger than ever.     Moreover, he has direct
control over the most important department of future Congress activity - the Village Industries&apos; Association.      The so-called retirement of the Mahatma will not accordingly diminish his hold over Congress machinery in any way hut will enable him to disown, all responsibility for the failure of the official Congress party during the next few years.     His retirement, therefore,  is only one of his strategic retreats to which he is in the habit of resorting whenever there is a political slump in the country&quot;.The first action taken by Congress Opposition when the Assembly met was to move a vote of censure on the Govei-nment for issuing a confidential circular which had,  in some way, leaked out,  in which they had given to the Local Governments their appreciation of the result of the Bombay Congress,  their suspicion that the new Village Industries Association, should be carefully watched and should not be accepted at its face value as a bona fide attempt to improve the economic conditions on lines indicated in appreciation for November last, and their suggestions as to how such a potentially dangerous movement could be countered.The motion was talked out;    the Congress party contended that the Government should not be so suspicious of Mr. gandhis motives, but did not deny the accuracy of the Government&apos;s views.      In reply the Home Member quoted chapter and verse insupport of the Government Is view, and cited speeches by Congress politicians and articles from Congress newspaper which had taken the same view of the Bombay Congress, and of Mr, Gandhi&apos;s recent activities.     Further corroboration of this view is to be. found in the quotation made in the previous paragraph.Though on this debate Congress opposition failed to
secure a victory, on three other occasions they have secured a majority vote against the Government.      On the first they carried a motion that the Government were not justified in keeping under detention under Regulation III an elected member of the Assembly.The member in question is Mr. Sarat Rose of Bengal, whom Government have full reason to believe to have been deeply involved in the terrorist movement.     The motion was discussed merely on the question of the &quot;privileges&quot; of members of the Legislature and the success of the opposition was of little importance.     More significant was the support of the resolution repudiating the Indo-British Trade Agreement.     The agreement was supported by Mr. .Mody, who has far more knowledge of Indo-British Trade relations than any other member of the Assembly, and the decision of the. Assembly is an example of the irresponsibility of the present Central Legislature.     Government are not bound by any such decision and,  indeed, have announced their intention of maintaining the Agreement as being in the best interests of India.Yet another example of irresponsibility -was the resolution advocating the removal of the ban on Red-Shirts.     The history of that movement and the improvement in the Province since the tan was imposed on these organisations and the fact that the maintenance of the ban in no way interferes with the constitutional political movement,  afford convincing -arguments for its maintenance, but these were not accepted by the Assembly.For three days the Joint parliamentary Committee&apos;s Report was discussed in the Assembly, and the debate was carried on in a spirit of good temper and, with two possible exceptions, the speeches criticising the proposals were moderate.      The final result was that the Congress Party on two resolutions
.3.695.advocating the rejection of the report and adopting a neutral attitude in regard to the communal award were defeated.They were thus compelled to support the two resolutions moved by Mr. Jinnah, the first criticising, but not rejecting, provincial autornomy, the second rejecting the federal scheme. Mr. Jinnah in his speech had emphasised the point,  that he did not want provincial autonomy,to he rejected, ;-tnus Congress, by. supporting his resolution, on this point.had to vote, directly against the policy which they had consistently advocated of rejecting provincial., autonomy.   - It was also noticeable that the leader of the House pressed the point that the rejection resolution moved by Congress was futile because it was well known that Congress would work the constitution if the Bill were passed;    he challenged the opposition to contradict this., but the challenge was not taken up.    On the communal award, both the Congress Party, which advocated neutrality, and the Congress Nationalist Party, which advocated rejection,  suffered severe defeat, and support was given to the award by a large majority.
