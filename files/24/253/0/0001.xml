THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.REGRET. OOPY NO._^O.P. 1.(35)CABINET.TRADE AGREEMENT WITH INDIA ON THIS SUBJECT OF INDICT PROTECTIVE DUTIES.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Origin of the Agreement.As my colleagues will be aware, discussions have been proceeding for some time with the Government of India for the conclusion of a Trade Agreement supplementary to the main Ottawa Agreement.    It was not possible at Ottawa to secure from the Government of India any undertakings in regard to Indian protective duties, the reason being that protection in India iB granted only after a Tariff Board inquiry and strictly in accordance with what are known as the principles of &quot;discriminating protection&quot;.    Moreover, a Tariff Board report on the cotton industry was pending and a Tariff Board inquiry into iron and steel was duo within less than two years.    In the circumstances the Ottawa Agreement did not deal very satisfactorl^ with the protective duties on goods of interest to these important trades.2. The present negotiations, which are now on the point of completion, are the direct outcome of the work done by the Mission which went out to India in the Autumn of 1933 from Lancashire under the Chairmanship of Sir William Clare Lees. This Mission, besides negotiating an agreement with the Millowners&apos; Association, Bombay, urged upon the Government of India their desire that the cotton and artificial silk industries should be brought within the scope of the Ottawa Agreement; and
they were able to secure an assurance that negotiations on this matter would be entered upon as soon as the Indo-Japanese treaty negotiations, which were then proceeding, were over.Provisions of the Agreement.3. The Agreement is to remain in force for so long as the main Ottawa Agreement (which is subject to 6 months notice of denunciation) continues.    It begins by recognizing that Indian industry may require a higher level of protection against foreign imports than against imports of United Kingdom origin. It does not deal with the actual rates of duties on particular commodities but it does provide that protective duties are only to be imposed after due enquiry by a Tariff Board in accordance with the principles of &quot;discriminating protection&quot;. It establishes the Ottawa principle of equality of opportunity, but does so in more precise language, namely, that protective duties are only to be such as are necessary to equate prices of United Kingdom goods to the fair selling prices for similar goods produced in India.    Further, any differential margins established in accordance with these principles are not to be altered to the detriment of United kingdom goods.    The right of India to impose overriding revenue duties is recognized but on this point wa have a private assurance from the Government of India that they do not anticipate that such duties are likely to be necessary during the currency of the Agreement.    When the question of protection arises United Kingdom industries are to have full opportunity to state their case and to answer the case presented by other interested parties.4. Beth Governments undertake to receive and consider at all times any conclusions, agreements or reports which may be framed as the result of conferences between United Kingdom and Indian industries.
5. Lancashire, of course, attaches the greatest importance to the reduction of the import duty on cotton piece goods from the present level of 25% ad valorem; but, as indicated above, the Agreement does not deal with the actual rate of duty on particular   commodities.    The Government of India, however, renew the assurance which they previously gave that this duty-will be reduced as soon as revenue conditions permit of the removal of the general revenue surcharge of bp ad valorem,, No doubt the Agreement will be criticised in Lancashire on the ground that it accords no immediate reduction of duty,    But responsible leaders in Lancashire have throughout recognised that this would be impossible.    The reduction of the duty is and must remain a Budget question, and we must hope that when the Indian Budget comes to be opened at the end of February, the reduction will be accorded.    I attach the greatest importance to obtaining the reduction, and Lancashire will judge not only this Agreement but our whole policy on India by the test of getting this reduction in the Indian Budget06. For our part, we give an undertaking that Indian cotton goods shall be accorded in Colonial markets equality of opportunity with United Kingdom cotton goods.    JVe also undertake to do what we can through commercial channels to assist Lancashire&apos;s efforts to us* more Indian raw cotton and we further promise to continue the privilege of free entry for Indian pig iron, for so long as present duties on United Kingdom iron and steel in India are not altered to our detrimentsConelusion.7. The value of the Agreement to this country is that It marks the desire of the Government of India to assure fair conditions for United Kingdom exports in the Indian Market. It ensures that United Kingdom Industries shall receive a proper hearing whenever the question arises of imposing or
-i4-amending duties on protective grounds on goods of the kind which they export to India and that the interests of the United Kingdom competitor as distinct from the foreign competitor shall be &quot;borne in mind.    It also formally recognizes that agreements reached as a result of industrial co-operation between the two countries are entitled to consideration by the Government of this country or of India as the case may be.    It is therefore a strengthening link in the commercial relations between this country and India and while in the nature of the case it Is limited to the establishment of principles rather than actual rates of duty, it ought to create that atmosphere of good-will and sense of fair treatment which is essential if the improved commercial rslations between this country ana India are to be strengthened and to bear fruit,,sY 0R11Board of Trade,3rd January, 1935,
