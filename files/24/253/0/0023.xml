Copy No.    58CP. 23 (35).CABINET.FORTHCOMING CONFERENCE WITH THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER.Strength of the German Armed. Forces. Report prepared by the Foreign Office and the three Defence Services. (Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.) Introduction.1. WITH the authority of the Lord President of the Council (in the absence of the Prime Minister) a Conference was held, with Sir Maurice Hankey in the Chair, at 2, Whitehall Gardens, on Thursday, the 17th January, 1935, which was attended by Sir Robert Vansittart, the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the Chief of the Air Staff, and their technical representatives, for the purpose of formulating definite ideas in respect of the maximum armed forces of all kinds to which, having regard to our own security, we would be prepared to agree that the Germans should attain, if by so doing we could secure a general settlement.2. In order to assist the three Defence Departments in their consideration of this matter, certain general principles had been suggested by the Foreign Office, which were accepted by the Conference as a basis for their work in the following form : (a) The ultimate objective in aiming at a general settlement (of which the first step is the conversations with France to begin on the 1st February, 1935) is the return of Germany to the League and&apos;her participation in an Armaments Convention.(6) Our objective in any Armaments Convention must now be numerical limitation rather than reduction, but we should aim at some form of qualitative reduction where applicable.(c) Any such Convention might include (i) Supervision, (ii) Budgetary publicity.(iii) Control of trade in and manufacture of arms as far as possible on existing British lines.(In connection with (i), however, the three Chiefs of Staff stated that they maintained their objection to supervision, although they understood that the Cabinet had now decided in certain circumstances to agree to it in principle.)(d) So far as the limitation of armaments is concerned, it is proposed to open negotiations on the basis of Germany&apos;s armaments at the strength put forward in the Note of Germany ;s requirements dated the 16th April, 1934 (vide Cmd. 4559, page 18).(It is not, however, expected that Germany will now be agreeable to be limited to these figures, but will probably place her demands considerably higher, especially in the Air.)[11063] B
Naval Limitations. .\--&apos;r-&apos;- -o   r3. As regards the Navy, the Admiralty were asked by the Chairman to put forward proposals as to the size of the German Navy, both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view, particularly in relation to existing or proposed itaval treaties and the question of Germany&apos;s participation in those treaties.4. It was explained that the Foreign Office and the Admiralty had prepared a joint document dealing with the situation as a result of the Naval Conversations with the United Stales and Japan, and making recommendations as to procedure for future negotiations with the various European Powers (N.C.M. (35) 46). In this Paper the view was expressed that, as far as could be seen at present, the hopes of achieving world agreement as to the size of navies were extremely slender. It was further explained that the proposals which had been finally put before Japan and the United States were on a basis quite different from that on which the Washington and London Naval Treaties had been negotiated. It was now proposed not to attempt at present to lay down any sizes for the various navies, but, on the basis of accepting equality of status between the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom, each country should make a voluntary declaration of its programmes of construction over a period of six years from 1937 to 1942, inclusive.5. It was also pointed out that the question of naval armaments was a world question, whereas the question of Germany in particular was a European question, and the situation had developed on lines that had not been expected. There would have to be a Naval Conference this year, probably in the Autumn, in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Treaty, and it was extremely desirable that any prospects of agreement at this Conference should not be prejudiced owing to differences of opinion in Europe on other than Naval matters. If the question of German naval armaments was to be tied up with the question of general agreement with Germany, there might be grave risk of this happening. Attention wasalso drawn to the fact that France had clearly intimated that she was unwilling to attend any Naval Conference unless Germany was included, and, furthermore, that the French were anxious to widen the scope of such a Conference even further at some stage and include the important lesser Naval Powers.6. From this it would appear that naval negotiations with France would be impossible until the German requirements were known, and, if this were so, the first step ought obviously to be a consultation with Germany. Having regard to our experience with Japan, it would be extremely unwise to open the proceedings by asking Germany what would be the minimum size of Navy she desired. It would be a deliberate incitement to Germany to place her demands at a very high level, which might have the effect of frightening French opinion and thereby prejudicing the whole negotiations.7. It was considered wiser on all grounds, therefore, to approach Germany on lines similar to those on which we approached Japan. This procedure would have the further advantage of bringing Germany down to the practical financial issues inseparable from any naval programme. It is proposed, there-fore, that Germany should be asked what would be her building programme over the six years 1937-42, it being made clear to the German Government that this was done without prejudice to the present validity of the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and to any general conditions which the ex-Allied Governments may wish to make in return for the application in practice of the principle regarding equality of rights laid down in the Declaration of the 11th December, 1932. It is considered that Germany would be unlikely to put forward any programme for this period which she would be unable, in practice, to realise, and therefore it was hoped that her proposals would be on a moderate scale.8. The particular question of the size of the German Navy had been discussed with the French last July, and the Admiralty had formulated the following suggestions as to the size of the German Fleet. It is not suggested that this size should be made public or should be discussed with Germany, but it was known to the French, and there would be.no harm, therefore, in discussing it with them on this basis. By the Treaty of Versailles Germany was allowed a tonnage for her naval forces of 108,000 tons (or, as increased by the decision of
the Conference of Ambassadors, 144,000 tons). Under the Admiralty proposals oiven below, a total tonnage of 178,000 tons was proposed. The actual details of this tonnage are as follows : Category.	Number.	Tonnage.Capital ships ...	3 Deutschlands, plus 2	80,000	others of 25,000 tons	Aircraft Carrier	1      ...	22,000Cruisers (a)   ...	Nil   ...	NilCruisers (b)   ...	7      ...	44,000Destroyers and Leaders            ...	16 of 800 tons...	1	H- 8 of 1,500 tons	\    27,000	f 1 of 1,850 tons	JSubmarines   ...          ...           ..		5,000		178,0009. It might be that Germany would wish to construct ships to correspond with the French &quot; Dunkerques&apos;,&quot; It would be possible for her to do this under the arrangements suggested above, and we could raise no serious objection. It is also understood that Germany would prefer her Fleet to be based on a percentage of ours and not on the French Navy, a figure of approximately 35 per cent, having been mentioned, though it is understood a lesser percentage would be accepted. In July, when this matter was discussed with the French, they had not demurred to our suggestions in the above table, although they had intimated that they regarded the increase we proposed to the German Fleet as large.10. The view of the Conference may be summarised as follows. In any negotiations with Germany, the object in view is primarily to get such agreement as will make it possible for Germany and France and other European countries concerned to attend the Naval Conference which must be held this year; that we should not attempt to ask Germany for any final programme as to the size of her Navy, but should ask her to suggest a naval construction programme covering the six years 1937-42, subject to the reservation regarding the continuance of the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in paragraph 7. If the figures proposed by Germany do not result in her exceeding the total of 178,000 tons suggested by the Admiralty, then, so far as we were concerned, no objections would be raised, and it was understood that it might be possible to get agreement with France on such a basis.11. In the forthcoming negotiations with the French, therefore, this is the procedure which it is suggested should be adopted. It should be made plain, how-ever, in conversations with the French and with the Germans, that our proposals were without prejudice to the naval clauses of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which could only be abolished by the general consent of the Signatories thereto.Limitation of Land Forces.12. The War Office were asked by the Chairman to express their views on the size of the German Army, the number and calibre of guns which it was thought should be permitted in relation to the Army, the size and weight of tanks, or any other points in this connection. Attention was drawn to the fact that the question of para-military organisations, their prohibition or limitation, would also, presumably, be discussed, and suggestions as to the method of dealing with, tb is problem would be valuable.13. From the point of view of the War Office, it was stated that there was no change in our attitude, and that we could agree to the German Army being expanded to a size of 300,000 effectives, comprising 21 Infantry Divisions and 3 Cavalry Divisions. As for tanks and guns, the limits should be as previously suggested, i.e., with regard to guris the maximum calibre should., be 155 mm., and the size of tanks should be 16 tons.14. As regards tanks, it is understood that Germany, who had originally stated that she would be prepared to limit herself to tanks of 6 tons, might now wish to go up to the larger limit, as she had found it impracticable to con struct:[11063] b 2
tanks of this size to undertake the work required of them.: As equality: of rights was being conceded to Germany, this could not be opposed.       :15. So far as the French point of view was concerned, it was thought that the figure of 300,000 might be acceptable. The strength of the French metropolitan forces was, at present, 350,000, which comprises 20 Infantry Divisions and 5 North African Divisions, giving a total of about 25 Divisions in all.16. It was pointed out that there would be advantage in specifying definitely the maximum number of divisions into which the 300,000 effectives should be split. If this was not done, it might be possible, by having the divisions at a comparatively low peace strength, to double the size of the forces on mobilisation. It was equally desirable that the number of guns per division should be limited, otherwise each division might have a strength of guns greatly in excess of normal requirements. A very good formula existed in Article 160, Part V, of the Treaty of Versailles, Clause 1 of which read as follows :- &quot; By a date which must not be later than 31st March, 1920, the German Army must not comprise more than 7 Divisions of Infantry and 3 Divisions of Cavalry.After that date the total number of effectives in the Army of the States constituting Germany must not exceed 100,000 men, including officers in &apos;      establishments and depots.&quot;This might provide a very convenient precedent in future negotiation, though it must be borne in mind that in the British Draft Disarmament Convention no attempt is made to limit the number of guns permitted to signatories by that Convention. It is hardly likely, therefore, that Germany would ever consider such a limitation in present circumstances.17. It is doubtful whether we can continue to adhere to our original proposals as to the length of service with the colours. We had originally suggested a figure of 8 months. Germany had claimed 12 months, and we had stated in our memorandum of the 29th January, 1934, that we were prepared to concede her this figure.18. As regards the German Regular Forces, therefore, the proposal is that Germany should be limited to 300,000 daily effectives with the colours, comprising not more than 21 Infantry Divisions and 3 Cavalry Divisions and armed with guns not exceeding 155 mm. in calibre, and tanks not exceeding 16 tons, and that the length of service with the colours should not exceed 12 months. Any suggestion by Germany to exceed these figures would not only be unacceptable to us, but would, presumably, be totally unacceptable to France.Para-military Organisations.19. The German Government, in their statement of the 16th April, 1934 (Cmd. 4559, page 18), in respect of the S.A. and S.S., suggested regulations which -&apos;&apos; would provide that the S.A. and S.S. would  (1) possess no arms; (2) receive no instruction in arms; (3) not be concentrated or trained in military camps; (4) not be, directly or indirectly, commanded or instructed by officers ofthe Regular Army; (5) not engage in, or take part in, field exercises.&quot;It was also agreed that the non-military character of the S.A. and S.S. could be verified by a system of supervision.20. If Herr Hitler were still prepared to adhere to these proposals we should be quite satisfied. It was to be hoped that he would be ready to do so, seeing that the importance of the S.A. and S.S. from the military point of view had greatly diminished since the proposals were originally put forward.21. The question of the German police was also raised, but this was held to be rather a separate question, since the Committee at Geneva investigating this matter had decided that 38,000 of the German police were definitely to be classed as a military body.  It seemed necessary that agreement should be reached
*3 ^ oi) a 6that such German police as might be considered as having a definite military character should be included in the figure of 300,000 effectives. The same principle would, of course, apply to any police forces of other countries possessing military characteristics.22. So far as the para-military formations are concerned, therefore, we should be perfectly satisfied if Herr Hitler would reaffirm the proposals he made on the 16th April, 1934, as quoted above; but as regards the police, the matter was on a different footing, and such members of the police as might be definitely categorised as having military characteristics should be included in the figure of 300,000 effectives.Limitation of Air Forces.23. The Air Ministry were asked by the Chairman to put forward their views as to the size to which we should desire the German Air Force to be limited, the figures stating particularly the first line air strength. In proposing a figure it was pointed out that Germany&apos;s air demands would now probably be considerably increased. It was also suggested that it was desirable if possible to specify the types of aircraft which Germany should be allowed, e.g., fighters, bombers, &amp;c, and that a figure for the number of personnel in the Air Force should be quoted if possible.Suggestions were also requested as to any possible qualitative limitation in respect of aircraft which would, of course, have to be applied internationally, but which might be valuable to put forward.24. The Committee were informed that in any air agreement with Germany it was essential that in fixing the size of the total German air force the basis of calculation should be parity of Metropolitan Air Forces, aircraft employed overseas or allocated for embarkation in ships thus being excluded. The reasons for these proposed exclusions were that conditions governing the employment of aircraft abroad were quite different from those in the Home country, and that naval aircraft were governed by the size of fleets. It was not thought that the proposal to omit these two categories of aircraft would be the cause of any difficulty.25. In suggesting a figure for the German Air Force, the assumption was first put forward that France would in no circumstances agree to any reduction in the present size of her air forces. The French Metropolitan Air Force is at present equal to about 80 of our squadrons, which. Was equivalent to approximately 1,000 first line aircraft. It was assumed, further, that Germany would be unwilling to accept any figure below 1,000 aircraft.26. These figures were in excess of the proposals in the Memorandum of the 16th April, 1934, in which Germany claimed a numerical strength not exceeding &quot; 30 per cent, of the combined air forces of Germany&apos;s neighbours, or 50 per cent, of the military aircraft possessed by France (in France itself and in the French North African territories), whichever figure was the less.&quot; This figure would work out at somewhere between 600 and 800 first line aircraft. The Committee were reminded that a report had been received that Germany would wish to include, also, a percentage of the Russian air strength, which would increase her original proposals.27. On all grounds, therefore, it was felt that it would be unlikely that Germany would be willing to accept a figure of less than 1,000 first line aircraft, which would give her equality with France and Italy and ourselves so far as Metropolitan Air Forces were concerned. It was considered undesirable, however, that any figure mentioned in the negotiations should be identified with our own approximate position.28. While it was agreed that Germany would be likely to claim a figure of this kind, it was thought better, from the point of view of tactics, to begin with the proposals of the 16th April, which would form, also, the basis of negotiation so far as the military forces were concerned. To start at once on the basis of 1,000 first line aircraft for Germany might make negotiations with France very difficult, although it should be clearly pointed out to the French that, in our opinion, Germany would not be content with her previous figures.
-i- 29. As to the question of specifying the types of aircraft which Germany might be allowed, the Committee were reminded -of. the great, difficulty in defining aircraft because of the interchangeability of modern types for different kinds of work.30. There would be equal difficulty, also, in attempting to limit personnel, because any limitations could be so easily evaded. The first line strength of any air force was not the measure of its capacity, because everything would depend on the reserves behind, and, if sufficient cadres existed, it might be possible to maintain an offensive for an indefinite period. Any limitation to be effective, therefore, must deal with the question of reserves, and would, in consequence, be most difficult to enforce. It appeared that, as in many other matters, trust must be placed in the good faith of the nation.31. It was suggested that there were, however, certain general limitations in respect of reserves of aircraft and personnel which might be put forward. The number of service aircraft held in this country for all purposes, in addition to the metropolitan first line strength, is of the order of 300 per cent, of the metropolitan first line strength, and a method of assessment such as this might be used as a basis for a similar limitation of German strength. On the question of reserves of personnel, it was obviously not possible to interfere with civil aviation in any way, and, although an ordinary civil pilot might not at once be effective as a military pilot, he would have so much less to learn, and could, therefore, be available in a shorter time than completely raw personnel.32. It was suggested, also, that if Germany had a big civil and sporting aviation, she would possess many factors contributory to air power; that sporting pilots were on the way to become war pilots and could in peace time be worked up quite considerably from a technical point of view; that big civil and sporting aviation would mean a multiplicity of aerodromes and equipment, and if Germany possessed all these things and had, in addition, equality with Italy, France and ourselves, then in actual fact she might be stronger than any of these three Powers.33. It was pointed out that there was considerable force in this contention, but it was also remarked that the abnormal development of civil aviation in Germany had probably been brought about by restrictions on military flying, and that if Germany was now to be granted a normal Air Force, she might devote less attention to her civil aviation. Certain limits were, in any case, imposed on German civil aviation by the fact that it was confined in general to internal services, since she had no colonies or other places with which she had to maintain communication.34. As regards the total number of pilots on whom the Air Ministry have a call, including all General Duties serving officers, this was of the order of 500 per cent, of the total first-line strength at home and abroad, and it would be desirable that a limit calculated on a similar basis should be accepted by Germany.35. Returning to the question of qualitative limitation, the Committee were reminded that a suggestion had been put forward on behalf of the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva that the limit should be 3 tons unladen weight, excluding troop carriers and flying boats. It was pointed out that we, ourselves, could not possibly accept any such restriction unless it was applied universally, although if Germany was ready to agree voluntarily to such a restriction there would be every advantage. It was extremely doubtful whether &quot;the United States of America and Japan would take part in any Convention which might be negotiated, and, therefore, it would be better that the question of qualitative limitation for aircraft should not be raised.36. So far as the size of the German Air Force is concerned, we should in the first place start on the basis of the German proposals of the 16th April, 1934, although it is not expected that Germany will agree to these figures. We should be prepared, if necessary, to concede to Germany having Metropolitan equality with France, Italy and ourselves, that is to say, excluding all overseas aircraft or aircraft allocated for embarkation in ships; and that the. figure would be approximately 1,000 first line aircraft; that it is not possible to specify the types of; aircraft which Germany should be allowed owing to the fact that modern aircraft are capable of being employed on all kinds of duties; that it is equally
impossible to specify a figure of personnel owing to the ease1 with which any limitations might be evaded. The same remarks apply to reserves of aircraft and personnel, though, if possible, Germany should be asked to agree to limitations of total numbers calculated as a percentage of her first line metropolitan strength; and, finally, that while there would be every advantage in Germany limiting the size&apos;of her aircraft, it would not be possible for us to put forward any qualitative limitations suggestions unless there was the possibility of their universal acceptance.Italian Proposals of January 31, 1934.37. The Conference were also asked to consider the proposals put forward by the Italian Government (Cmd. 4512, pp. 18 and 19). These proposals seemed to have been under discussion between M. Laval and Signor Mussolini at the recent Rome conversations, but the view of the Conference was that so far as we were concerned, they were, in general, unacceptable, and that we should endeavour to avoid discussion of them if possible.Common Upper Limit.38. The Committee also were informed that Germany might possibly propose a solution of the whole problem on the lines of a &quot;common upper limit,&quot; within which each Power would make a unilateral declaration of its requirements.39. It was agreed that any such proposal was quite unacceptable, and would probably give rise to the very greatest difficulties, particularly as to the nation whose forces should be taken as representing the &quot; common upper limit.&quot; If this proposal should be put forward by Germany, she should be asked what she intended, and that these difficulties should be pointed out.Summary of Conclusions. 40.   The conclusions may be summarised as follows :-  Naval. Limitations.(a) The primary object of negotiations in respect of the German naval forces is to achieve such agreement as will make it possible for Germany, France and other European countries concerned to attend the Naval Conference to be held this year and to avoid the prospects of this world Naval Conference being prejudiced by purely European difficulties. It is, therefore, desirable to treat the naval negotiations on a separate basis if this is possible. At the same time it is highly important to open discussions with Germany as early as possible.(b) That no attempt should be made to negotiate with Germany as to theultimate size of her naval forces, but she should be asked to propose a naval construction programme covering the six years 1937-42.(c) That, so long as the figures which Germany may put forward under theproposal in conclusion (b) above do not result in her exceeding the total of 178,000 tons in accordance with the details set out in paragraph 8 of this Report, we shall raise no objections. These proposals would enable Germany, if she wished, to construct two vessels of the &quot; Dunkerque &quot; class. id) That it should be made plain, in the course of the negotiations both with the French and the Germans, that any proposals put forward in connection with the size of the German naval forces, quantitatively or qualitatively, are without prejudice to the present validity of the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and to any general conditions which the ex-Allied Governments may wish to make in return for the application in practice of the principle regarding equality of rights laid down in the Declaration of the 11th December, 1932.Limitation of Land Forces.(e) That the German regular land forces should be limited to 300,000 daily effectives with the Colours, comprising not* more than 21 Infantry Divisions and 3 Cavalry Divisions, and armed with guns not exceeding 155 mm. in calibre and tanks not exceeding 16 tons in weight.
(/) That we should prefer that the length of service with the Colours should be limited, if possible, to eight months, though we have agreed to this time being extended to twelve months if necessary.(g) It is desirable to specify the maximum number of divisions, and thenumber of guns per division, within the total strength allowed, in order to avoid devices by which the German forces could be mote rapidly expanded on mobilisation, though it is doubtful if Germany-will agree since no mention is made of this in our Draft Disarmament Convention.Para-military Organisations.(h) That, although the situation in Germany has changed considerablysince the Memorandum of the 16th April, 1.934, we should be quite satisfied if the German Government would reaffirm the suggestions for regulating the S.A. and S.S. contained in this Memorandum, especially since military importance of these forces had greatly diminished since the proposal had been made.(i) That the Police, however, should be treated on a different footing frompara-military organisations and that such numbers of the Police Forces as might be definitely categorised as possessing military characteristics should be included in the figure of 300,000 effectives.Limitation of Air Forces.(j) That if, as is anticipated, Germany will not accept the figures proposed on the 16th April, 1934, we should be prepared, if necessary, to&apos; concede to Germany metropolitan equality with France, Italy and ourselves; that is to say, excluding all overseas aircraft or aircraft allocated for embarkation in ships, she should be permitted a figure of approximately 1,000 first-line aircraft.(k) That it is not possible to specify the types of aircraft of which the German Air Force should be composed, owing to the interchangeability of modern types of aircraft.( ) That it is not possible to specify a figure for the personnel of the regular Air Force, owing to the ease with which any limitations might be evaded.(m) That, in respect of reserves of aircraft and personnel, Germany should be asked to agree not to exceed total numbers of service aircraft and pilots calculated on a percentage basis of her first-line metropolitan strength.in) That, while there would be every advantage in persuading Germany to limit the size of her aircraft, it would not be possible for us to put forward any suggestions for qualitative limitations unless there was a possibility of their universal acceptance.Italian Proposals of January 31, 1934,(o) That we should endeavour to avoid discussions of these proposals, if possible, since they are wholly unacceptable.Common Upper Limit.(p) That, if a solution on the lines of a common upper limit should be proposed by Germany, we should ask exactly what is intended by this proposal, and should explain the difficulties and, in particular, those in respect of the nation whose forces should be taken as representing the common upper limit.M.
