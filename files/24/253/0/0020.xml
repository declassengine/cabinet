IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT) . E T. COPY NO. UL,QC BCABINET.Nutrition:__Report of the Economic Advisory Council.-20l5lL- MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP HEALTH.The Committee on Scientific Research of the Economic-Advisory Council recommended in a report (E.A.C.(S.C.)  13) which was circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 185 (34))  that,  as a first step towards the adoption of a new policy on nutrition, a new Committee of the Economic Advisory Council should be set up to &quot;inquire into the subject.    This recommendation has been considered at a conference of the Ministers concerned, at which the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture,  the Minister of Labour and I were present.    It seems to us that,  although the terms of the report are open to some criticism,  there is need for further inquiry as regards both the bulk consumption of foodstuffs and individual diets. The terms of reference for such an inquiry should,  inour view, be:-11 To inquire into the facts,  quantitative and qualitative,  in relation to the diet of the people, and to report as to any changes therein which appear desirable in the light of modern advances in the knowledge of nutrition.&quot;We think that it is unnecessary to set up a new committee to carry out the inquiry,  and that the existingAdvisory Committee on Nutrition appointed by myself canconveniently be reconstituted for the purpose.We propose accordingly that the Advisory Committee should be expanded into a Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself with the terms of reference set out above, and that its.personnel should be strengthened &quot;by the addition of a few new members,  including some men of practical experience,  as to whom there will be consultation with the other Government Departments concerned.
The terms of reference and personnel of the present Advisory Committee are given in the Appendix.The Ministers referred to in the first paragraph of this Memorandum and the President of the Board of Education concur in these recommendations.(Initialled)    E.H.Y.25th January,   1935,
