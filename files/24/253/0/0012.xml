(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).flj! C R E T.r^P. 12 (55) ... COPY NO.   us i.C A BIN B T. COMMITTEE ON INDIA. SECOND REPORT ON DRAFT GOVERNMENT OF INDIA BILL.1.     The Committee have already submitted to the Cabinet a Report recommending that the draft Government of India Bill, in the form annexed to the Report, should be approved by the Cabinet with a view to authority being given for its publication at an early date (CP. 5 (35)).      The Bill now circulated to the Cabinet is drafted without a Preamble;   but in paragraph 7 of the covering explanatory Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India reference was made to the fact that certain considerations made it desirable on the whole that a short Preamble should be inserted, re-affirming the policy indicated in the Preamble to the Government of India Acti 1919. The Secretary of State at the same time undertook to consult the Viceroy on this subject, and the telegrams exchanged with the Viceroy were laid before the Committee at a further Meeting held today, January 15th, 1935.2.     As a result of further consideration of the matter in the light of these telegrams, the Committee have come to the conclusion that no Preamble should be inserted in the Bill;    but that the Secretary of State for India in the course of his speech on the Second Reading of the Bill should make a statement on the whole question of Dominion Status.      It was agreed that the text of this statement should be prepared in consultation with the Cabinet Committee, and submitted to the Cabinet for
approval.

3. The Committee accordingly recommend to the Cabinet that the procedure outlined in the preceding paragraph be adopted.

Signed on behalf of the Committee

SAMUEL HOARE

Chairman.
