this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1935.SECRET. Copy No.  4?CP. 36 (35).CABINET.USE OF TEAR GAS IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues will remember that in December 1933 I circulated two memoranda, CP. 301 (33) and CP. 301a (33), relating to a proposal by the High Commissioner for Palestine that on humanitarian grounds the use of tear gas by the Police Force in Palestine, for the purpose of avoiding casualties in dispersing illegal assemblies and riotous crowds, should be permitted.2. These memoranda were considered by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 20th December, 1933, and it was agreed (Cabinet Conclusions 70 (33), paragraph 3) (a) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should authorise the High Commissioner for Palestine to use tear gas in dealing with mobs and riots in cases where it would otherwise be necessary to shoot.*j . ji. M. M,&quot;7v&quot; &quot;tv tv&quot; w &quot;a&quot;3. Fortunately, Sir Arthur Wauchope has so far had no occasion to use the authority granted him in the decision of the Cabinet reproduced above, but a supply of tear gas has been acquired by the authorities, and the personnel who would be required to supervise its use in emergency have been given the necessary instruction.4. Subsequently, the Colonial Office obtained, for Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s information and guidance, certain confidential papers describing an experiment in the use of tear gas undertaken by the Government of the Punjab. In this case tear gas was used not against a hostile mob, but against dangerous criminals entrenched in a house, the object being to reduce the risk of casualties amongst police officers engaged in such an operation. In November last Sir Arthur Wauchope asked permission to authorise the Inspector-General of Police and Prisons to employ tear gas in Palestine in circumstances similar to those for which its use has been approved by the Government of the Punjab, provided (i) that its use is limited to cases of necessity when no other means are considered likely to attain the object; and (ii) that in every case of its use all practicable steps are taken to ensure that innocent   persons   are   not   put   to   unnecessary   discomfort   in consequence, and that adjoining buildings are, therefore, cleared before the gas is used.He added that tear gas would be employed in such circumstances only on the direct order of the Inspector-General.5. This proposal went beyond the authority already given for the use of tear gas in Palestine, which was confined to dealing with mobs and riots, and I informed the High Commissioner that it would be necessary for me to bring the matter again before the Cabinet. I pointed out that, in the case of India, authority was given to use gas against dangerous entrenched criminals who were[11166]
certain or likely to inflict casualties, and I asked the High Commissioner whether it was his intention that the use of gas against entrenched criminals in Palestine should be subject to a similar condition.6. In a despatch of the 18th January last, the High Commissioner makes it clear that he does not anticipate that occasion will arise for the use of tear gas against strongly entrenched criminals in urban areas, and that the circumstances necessitating the use of gas which are most likely to occur in Palestine are those in which bandits entrench themselves in caves in the mountainous country or conceivably in a building in some small and isolated village.7. It is a fact that from time to time the Palestine Police Force have suffered casualties in rounding up armed bandits, and I consider that the authority which the High Commissioner now seeks for the use of tear gas in dealing with banditry might reasonably be granted.8. If, therefore, the Cabinet approves, I should propose to authorise the High Commissioner to permit the use of gas by the Police Force in circumstances such as those described above, where there is a serious risk of casualties being incurred by the Police Force if the Police were unable to use gas and had to rely on other weapons.9. I reproduce in the Appendix copy of my recent correspondence with the High Commissioner on this subject.(Intd.) P. C.-L.Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1, February 8, 1935.
(1)Secret Despatch &quot; A &quot; from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, November 24, 1934.(Secret.)   &quot;A.&quot; High Commissioner for Palestine,Sir, Jerusalem, November 24, 1934.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch of the 30th October, 1934, forwarding papers relating to an experiment in the use of tear gas undertaken by the Government of the Punjab.2. I am grateful to you for placing this information at my disposal, and take this opportunity of informing you that I have authorised the Inspector-General, Police and Prisons, to employ tear gas in similar circumstances in Palestine, provided (i) that its use is limited to cases of necessity when no other means are considered likely to attain the object; and (ii) that in every case of its use, all practicable steps are taken to ensure that innocent persons are not put to unnecessary discomfort in consequence, and that adjoining buildings are, therefore, cleared, before the gas is used.Tear gas would only be employed in such circumstances on the direct order of the Inspector-General.I have, &amp;c.ARTHUR WAUCHOPE.(2)Paraphrase of Secret Telegram No. 360 from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for Palestine, December 7, 1934.(No. 360.   Secret.)YOUR despatch Secret &quot; A &quot; of 24th November : Tear gas.Pending receipt of despatch from me, please suspend action on lines indicated.(3)Secret Despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for Palestine, December 13, 1934.(Secret.)Sir, Downing Street, December 13, 1934.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your secret despatch A of the 24th November in which you informed me that you have authorised the Inspector-General, Police and Prisons, to employ tear gas, under certain conditions, in circumstances similar to those described in the recent report by the Government of the Punjab regarding the use of gas against armed criminals who had taken refuge in a house.2. As this proposal goes beyond the authority already given for the use of tear gas in Palestine, which was confined to dealing with mobs and riots, it will be necessary for me to mention the matter to the Cabinet, and I have there-fore requested you, in my telegram of the 7th December, to suspend action for the present,3. In the case of India, authority was given to use gas against dangerous entrenched criminals who were certain or likely to inflict casualties. I shall be glad to learn whether it is your intention that the use of gas against entrenched criminals in Palestine should be subject to a similar condition.
4. You will have noticed that, in dealing with the entrenched criminals in the Ferozepore district, the Indian police used tear-gas guns and shells and not bombs. I note that when tear gas is used in similar circumstances in Palestine, adjoining buildings will first be cleared. But I shall be obliged if you will consider whether, as an additional precaution, the use of guns rather than bombs might not diminish the risk of alarm and inconvenience to innocent persons, by limiting the local effect of the gas, and might not at the same time enable the police to operate in greater security.5. I shall await your reply to this despatch before any reference is made to the Cabinet; and I have to request that, pending reference to the Cabinet, action on the lines contemplated in your despatch under acknowledgment should not be taken.I have, &amp;c.P. CUNLIFFE-LISTER.(4)Secret Despatch &quot;A&quot; from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, January 18, 1935.(Secret.)   &quot;A.&quot; High Commissioner for Palestine,Sir, Jerusalem, January 18, 1935.I have the honour to refer to your Secret despatch of the 13th December, 1934, on the subject of the use of tear gas by the Police in Palestine, and to inform you that tear gas has not yet been employed by the Police to assist in the capture of criminals, and will not be employed for that purpose until I have received your further instructions after reference to the Cabinet.2. I do not anticipate that occasion will arise for the use of tear gas against strongly entrenched criminals in urban areas. The circumstances necessitating the use of gas which are most likely to occur in Palestine are those in which bandits entrench themselves in caves in the mountainous country, or conceivably in a building in some small and isolated village. To deal with such situations, I am advised by the Inspector-General of Police that hand-bombs could in most cases be used with effect and without inconveniencing innocent members of the public or unduly endangering the Police. A great number of the caves in Palestine have a hole in the roof through which lachrymatory bombs could be effectually dropped.3. I therefore doubt the necessity for acquiring rifles capable of firing gas grenades, which, apart from the other considerations mentioned, would necessitate the training of a number of Police in their use, and thus render it more difficult to maintain secrecy in respect of Governments possession of supplies of lachrymatory gas.I should, nevertheless, be glad to be provided with detailed information of the apparatus used by the Indian Police, its cost, the method of employment, and other relevant particulars.I have, &amp;c.ARTHUR WAUCHOPE, High Commissioner for Palestine.o
