TRADING IN ARMS - THE DRAFT CONVENTION. ^Oif. by the Secretary, Cabinet.At their Meeting on January 9th, 1935, (Cabinet1 (35))  the Cabinet had under consideration the subject ofTrading in Arms, and agreed inter alia that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should draft in precise languagecertain propositions suggested by him at the Meeting and  &apos;should circulate them for consideration at the next weekly meeting of the Cabinet, when other points still outstandingwould also be dealt v/ith.      The propositions in question read as follows:-(i) The Cabinet would, agree to a Convention to establish a licensing system for all countries for both manufacture and export of arms and munitions and to make public returns in respect of both exports and manufacture:(ii) The Cabinet would accept a system of permanent and automatic supervision, including local inspection,  as part of a   -Disarmament Convention,  in order to ensure that the Convention was being carried out:(iii) The Convention now under consideration, however,  is not one for disarmament, &quot;but for the following two purposes : -(a) The regulation of the traffic in arms, so that an embargo, when it is decided on,  can at once &quot;be made effective:(b) In order that figures relating to arms traffic and manufacture may be published.(iv) If the figures so returned are challenged, the Permanent Disarmament Commission will charge,itself with the matter and communicate with the parties concerned (who undertake to co-operate)  so that a report may be issued with a view to establishing the facts.
On the instructions of the Prime Minister, I circulate herewith the attached letter which I have received from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, from which it will he seen that the Secretary of State does not wish to modify the language of the above propositions which, so far as he is concerned, may therefore be taken as the propositions which should he circulated for consideration at the Meeting of the Cabinet on January 16th.Attention is also directed to the second and third paragraphs of the Secretary of State&apos;s letter relative to the questions of export credits and component parts respectively.(Signed)    M.P.A.  HANKEY, Secretary,    Cahinet.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 10th January, 1935.
Foreign Office,S. W. 1. 9th January, 1935.My dear Hankey,I have looked again at the four propositions constituting the formula recorded at the bottom of page 1 of the Minutes of this morning&apos;s Cabinet and I have no suggestions to make for their modification.      It seems to me that they are reasonably clear and the language is sufficiently precise.    So far as I am concerned, therefore, they may be taken as the propositions which should be circulated with a view to consideration at next week&apos;s Cabinet.I would remind my colleagues that there must be added a proposition insisting that export credits and the like should not be available for the sale of arms.There is also the question of &quot;component parts&quot;.     As to these, it seems to me that everything depends on examining the definition proposed or on securing that a suitable definition-ition is employed.    For example, if by component parts are meant parts which are not only intended for use in arms as defined in the Convention but as can only be used for such arms, I should not have thought that objection would arise.    If,  on the other hand,  component parts are so defined as to cover a vast mass of&quot; material of ambiguous use,  the resulting situation would be intolerable.    It is, therefore,  simply a question of sufficiently accurate definition, and I suggest that our Delegation might be instructed to see that the definition is accurately framed to cover only the more limited class of objects above indicated.Yours very sincerely,(Sgd.) JOHN SIMON.Maurice Hankey, G.G.B., G.C.M.G., etc.,  etc., etc.
