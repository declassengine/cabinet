2 (A).-FRENCH AIR PROPOSALS FOR A TREATY OF mutual guarantee.(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1161-B, 1162-B and 1166-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the following papers :  (i) Report   bv   the   Chiefs   of   Staff   Sub-Committee   (C.I.D.   Paper No. 1161-B).(ii) Memorandum  by  the   Secretary  on  the   Proposed  Air   BombingConvention (C.I.D. Paper No. 1162-B). (iii) Comments by the Foreign Office on the Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (1161-B) and on the Memorandum by the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence  (1162-B)  (C.I.D.  Paper No. 1166-B).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the matters raised under items 2 (A) and (B) both related to the recent Anglo-French conversations and to the agreement which had been reached in principle, which covered proposals regarding mutual air assistance. Paper 2 (A) was concerned with the main proposal and 2 (B) with a matter which arose out of it and was related to the unrestricted bombing of civilians. There was one point about which he thought there was general agreement in all the papers, which was that there should be simultaneity in the conclusion of the Air Convention and the general settlement. In other words, there was no intention of separating the proposals into two parts, and he would see that statements were made both in the House and outside to make this position perfectly clear.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the communique issued as a result of the Anglo-French conversations dealt with a number of topics, and he understood the Prime Minister to say that ail these topics would be negotiated and discussed concurrently and that one would not be isolated and agreed by itself. This, he thought, was the general understanding, but he wanted to make it clear that this did not mean that all the clauses in the communique would necessarily be agreed, because there might be different ways of dealing with some of the matters raised therein, e.g., security.THE PRIME MINISTER said the idea was that the treatment of all the matters should be simultaneous, with the idea that there would be no separation of the communique into two parts. He agreed it might be found, for example, that the Eastern Pact would become so transformed as to be quite different from its present form. What he meant was that the Air Proposal would not be abstracted from the general setting of the document. In other words, . there would be no separation and separate negotiation of this Pact without the other matters. If this was generally agreed, he thought there should be a conclusion recorded to this effect.Referring to Paper 2 (A), he would, ask the Chief of the Naval Staff if he had got any remarks to make.SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD said that the gist of the Chiefs of Staff Report was summarised on page 4 in paragraphs 18, 19 and 20. He said that it was a great advantage to the Chiefs of Staff to be able to explain personally that they were not opposing the idea of the proposed Air Pact in principle, but rather were just trying to point out the military implications so far as they saw them. The Chiefs of Staff realised that there were both political and military implications in the proposal and that it was not for them to say which were the most important. So far as possible they had tried not to remark on the political considerations, but the two were so intermingled that it was difficult to keep them separate.&apos; -Paragraph; 19 gave the Chiefs of Staff general conclusions. They had had to take into consideration the importance of the interpretation of the words &quot; unprovoked &quot; and &quot;immediate.&quot; They felt some anxiety as to whether the other countries which might be parties to the Pact would view these implications
in the same way as we might do in this country. The Foreign Office Paper which commented on the Chiefs of Staff Eeport dealt with that point, but the Chiefs of Staff felt that the French especially might conceivably take a different interpreta-tioh of the commitment to the one we might take. They had particularly noticed that M. Flandin, on his return to Paris, had made the point that France had secured a promise of immediate and automatic support. In paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office Paper, it was stated &apos;&apos; A serious and unprovoked air attack by Germany upon France would certainly constitute &apos; a flagrant violation &apos; of Article 2 of Locarno, and &apos; an unprovoked act of aggression 1 within the meaning of Article 4 (3), which would bring our undertaking &apos; immediately to come to the help &apos; of France, into operation.&quot;The only possible addition which the proposed convention would make to Locarno on this point is that, in the circumstances postulated, we should be bound to hold that &quot;immediate action &quot; was necessary, and there could hardly be any doubt about that. The Chiefs of Staff quite saw that, if France were bombed for one or^two days by Germany, that might constitute a serious and dangerous, aggression. At the same time, however, it might not be &apos;&apos; unprovoked aggression.&quot; His thoughts turned to the position vis-a-vis Abyssinia and Italy at the present time. If Abyssinia had air forces and, due to the mobilisation of Italian troops, had decided that the only way to save herself would be an attack now on Italian bases, it might be difficult to say that such action by Abyssinia was &quot; unprovoked.&quot; The Chiefs of Staff realised, however, that, having put forward their view, if the general proposal was considered satisfactory, then they would have nothing further to add. The Foreign Office made another important point, also, on page 5 (paragraph (10)), in reply to the Chiefs of Staff contention that there was a very real difficulty in making plans with all the countries concerned in the Air Pact. The Foreign Office reply read as follows&quot; The answer is that such a question must be considered in a spirit of realism, and the reality is that the circumstances in which we should have to join Germany against France and Belgium are inconceivable.&quot;If this was so, and the Chiefs of Staff could work on that basis and need not consider the most difficult of the two problems as being likely to arise, that would make a big difference. There was one further point. In paragraph 20 of their Report/Chiefs of Staff recommended that the proposed guarantee treaty should not be concluded, or at any rate ratified until the armaments part of the settle-ment had been negotiated. Whatever military difficulties there might be in the Pact, if reduction of armaments formed part of the agreement, then that would very greatly improve our position and relieve some of our responsibilities.SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD said that he had little to add to the remarks of Sir Ernie Chatfield, with which he entirely agreed. The Chiefs of Staff felt that an Air Pact of the kind proposed was, perhaps, more; liable to draw us into war than the commitments under Locarno, because it might be very much easier for some irresponsible person to bring about a situation on the frontier which would make it difficult to decide who was the aggressor and we-might thereby be dragged in.   It would certainly be easier for this to happen than if there was time to think and consider, as there was under the Locarno-Agreement.   There was also the point of the other commitments of France on the Continent, which might also perhaps tend to entangle us.   As regards the^ question of military conversations, it was hard to understand whether the possi-bility of these conversations was more likely to arise than under Locarno.   It was thought that the French would desire conversations and if so, this request would be hard to resist.   If we had conversations with France, and Germany demanded conversations with her, it might be difficult to refuse, and conversations with both France and Germany were obviously impossible.   The Chiefs of Staff did feel,-from their point of view, that the commitments of the Pact would put us in a more difficult position thaK.under the commitments of Locarno.   This was, of. course, entirely a military point of view.   At the meeting with. Ministers. :on&apos;: ^c^J^ur^i, ffi. which the Chiefs of Staff had attended, the Prime minister had suggested that perhaps the.Chiefs of Staff had not appreciated, sufficiently.: the political aspect of the proposal.   He would like to say that the: Chiefs, of -S3      [11231]- v      row -ro-vT Oill ,&quot;: wi-Vixq .,-.! uj:uj-;n rb-J-w zsaJixQx,
Staff had looked at it from the purely military point &apos;6fi view because they had ^understood that that was what was wanted, and they would perfectly understand if; political conditions were such as to necessitate ah over-ruling of -military-opinion.     : ; si;iJ y   .i-j---.;.;7ri- -M\l r.iy,e uiiyv -u-iarijij^b has ri.;SIR EDWARD ELLINGTON entirely agreed with the remarks which&apos;the other two Chiefs of Staff had made.SIR JOHN SIMON said he would like to thank the Chiefs of Staff for the explanations they had given, which were very important. He hoped that the Paper prepared in the Foreign Office had pointed out some of the considerations. There was, however, one certain specific matter. If it was imagined that under the Air Pact our action depended on unprovoked air attack, then it was quite clear, as stated in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office Paper, that we should not automatically be brought in in circumstances in which it was impossible for us to formulate an independent decision. The conditions under the Treaty of Locarno provided for unprovoked air attack, and the conditions in the proposed Air Pact as to the decision to take action were just as much a part of the new Pact as they were of Locarno. He hoped the Chiefs of Staff would appreciate that view which he had been led to approach. The phrases in Locarno and the Air Pact dealing with this point were identical. He hoped that it was clear that we should have an opportunity of forming an honest judgment, and would not be caught in a trap or by some doubtful incident. It was really a matter of drafting, which was very much in the minds of the Foreign Office, and, from what the Chiefs of Staff had said, he thought that on general grounds their ideas were quite close to those of the Foreign Office.(Mr. Runciman entered the meeting at this point.): THE PRIME MINISTER said it was impossible to see in advance, and every event must be studied as it arose. Sir Ernie Chatfield had given a very interesting example of what might be a difficulty in defining the aggressor. This was a point which was always kept in mind. He hoped that one day it might be possible to try to get some standard as to how to find an aggressor. He reminded the Committee that this was a matter which was always present in the minds of the Cabinet, and that the aim was alwaj^s to try to narrow down the possibilities.LORD LONDONDERRY reminded the Committee that the French, when they had returned after the conversations here, had certainly talked about automatic and immediate assistance under the Pact.LORD HAILSHAM thought there was a definite danger that France might say that she had gained a tremendous advance on Locarno, whereas we might think that, in fact, the commitments had not in any way been extended. This was a danger of two parties in an agreement putting a different interpretation oh the same words. He hoped that there would be no attempt in any agreement to put in a definition of the aggressor. He felt it might be tempting Providence to,do this, and might, in fact, be showing&apos;clearly to a would-be aggressor the way in which he had to act in order to put the stigma of aggressor on the other side.&apos;Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said he did not think there was really any inconsistency in what M. Flandin had said and what the Foreign Secretary had stated. If it was assumed that the attack was unprovoked, and having reached agreement that this was the case, then assistance would be immediate and autoniatic. There might, of course, be a difference of opinion between France and ourselves on this point, but he doubted whether it would arise. He would like to ask one or two questions on the Chiefs of Staff Paper. First of all, he understood that in the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff they considered that the proposed Air Agreement was a definite extension of the Locarno commitment ?SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD agreed.3-.v.&apos;i Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said he felt the same.perhaps himself, but he asked, would not this appear to be the case just as much to Germany as to France?- b SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD agreed. -N., . i     i. , i ,        - . \-,] ,Mil. CHAMBERLAIN said in that ease would not the proposed Air Pact be&apos;more likely to act as a deterrent than the Treaty of Locarno ?     &apos; &apos;
$  tk U4 SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD said that, if there was a situation of strained relations under the Treaty of Locarno between France and Germany, the peace machinery would fee&apos;; brought into force in order to try and prevent war and also to try and determine who was the aggressor. This would give time for us to make up our minds and to have information in advance on. which to base our opinion. Under the proposed Air Pact our minds must be made up at once if the attack was unprovoked or not, and we should have little or no time to consider the circumstances.  ,Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that the point for consideration was whether the advantages gained by the increased deterrent which this Pact might be to Germany were greater or less than the disadvantages which Sir Ernie Chatfield had outlined. He agreed that this was a political question which the Cabinet must decide. To the layman&apos;s imagination, however, the new danger which had to be faced was that a country might think they could settle accounts by one single terrific knock-out blow on a vital spot. He did not know how far the Chiefs of Staff would say such action was practicable or ought to be taken seriously, but if what he had suggested was right, surely it would be a new temptation to an ill-disposed country to strike a blow of this kind; much greater, in fact, than it would be to start a war by the slow process of mobilisation and moving an army : that in any case must take some time, but it might be hoped that an air blow such as he had described would more or less end the war before it had begun. If there was anything in what he had said, and if it was possible to make the aggressor realise that action of this kind would not be the end of the war, then any such proposal must have increased value as a deterrent.SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD said the Chiefs of Staff rather felt that if there was danger of an air attack, it would depend to some extent on the relative strength of the respective air forces. The same thing applied to the other two Services. If the forces were approximately equal, that would surely provide a deterrent, even if there was no Pact.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that, in the case under consideration, i the forces were not equal and the aggressor would be exposed to heavy attack by the other signatory Powers.(The Committee adjourned for a short time to enable Ministers to take part in a Division.)SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSING BERD said that the power of the knock-out blow must not, he thought, be exaggerated. Personally he was unable to believe that any big scale air attack could be delivered which would so paralyse our whole power that we should be unable to continue the war. He did not think there were any targets in this country which, if heavily attacked, would knock us out from the start, and he rather thought the same thing would apply to France, Germany or Belgium.&quot;SIR EDWARD ELLINGTON said he did not quite agree with what had been said. If by a knock-out blow was meant a period of twenty-four hours, it would not be possible at the present time so to paralyse a country that they were completely incapacitated. On the other hand, a country seizing the initiative in this way might get a big advantage and might deal the attacked nation a blow from which it might be unable to recover. He did agree, however, that it was not possible to destroy in such a short time any particular thing which would have the effect of completely incapacitating the country at the outset.In answer to a question from Mr. Thomas, he said that combined air forces such as were proposed in the Pact ought to provide a deterrent if these were proper preparations. &apos;SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL questioned whether the phrase &quot;knock-out blow&apos;&apos; was really right. He thought that care was required in making use of this term. &apos; -, ,:,    ,.SIR JOHN SIMON said he thought that,-although one. side&apos;of&apos;this question was perhaps technical., the other side was the effect which an. attempt of this kind might have on the civil population.   This was, really a question for the;Home
Office. He wondered whether air attack had really reached the point when it could so disorganise the service of London that it would have consequences which might affect the whole outlook of the population. &apos;,&apos; THE&apos; PRIME MINISTER, referring to a case, of great demoralisation caused by a Zeppelin bomb in the last war, agreed that this was&apos;the real danger. It was not the soldiers who might be knocked out, but the public might become so demoralised as to get into unrestrained panic.SIR PHILIP CTJNLIFFE-LISTER said there was one point which had certainly affected Ministers in taking their decision at the Cabinet, to which reference was made in paragraph 14 of the Chiefs of Staff Report. In this paragraph it was said that the Air Pact might make it more difficult for us not to become involved indirectly, owing to commitments of other signatories. At the Cabinet he thought it had been made plain that this position would be completely safeguarded, and that there would be no risk in becoming involved in war with France and Germany because France went to the help of her allies in Eastern Europe. It was categorically stated that there had never been any intention of accepting this position, which would be fully safeguarded. The Chiefs of Staff, in their paragraph 14, thought there was a serious danger, and it might perhaps be wise that something should go on record as to the position.SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL said that probably if the Chiefs of Staff had considered their Paper after the Cabinet decisions were known, they might not have put in this paragraph.SIR JOHN SIMON said there were two distinct questions. First of all, has a case arisen in which we are bound to take part; and, secondly, if such a case has arisen, how are we to take part ? He thought it was understood that the actual cases in which we would take part had not been in any way extended from Locarno. The difference was in saying the method which we would employ. If that was correct, he thought there was justification for saying that the whole plan would be most carefully covered so as not to extend the classes of case in which we might have an obligation.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the question of Germany making a claim for a Colony and withholding that claim until she was ready to fight. Should we get assistance in this case ?SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER said the whole point was that we should get assistance for the first time under these proposals.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed and said the only question Jjhat France would have to consider was whether the aggression against us was/provoked.THE PRIME MINISTER said these points would be very carefully considered when the time came for drafting. He would like now to consider the other section of this matter on the agenda.2(B) UNRESTRICTED BOMBING OF CIVILIANS AND NON-MILITARY TARGETS. (C.I.D. Paper No. 1163-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Joint Memorandum by the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, together with remarks thereon by the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office (C..I.D. Paper No. 1163-B).THE PRIME MINISTER thought that, for the moment, this question might be reserved. It was really something which would come up in a scattered way in any negotiations. The question was, to whom should the matter be remitted for consideration, and he would like to suggest an ad hoc Committee of Cabinet Ministers:SIR JOHN SIMON agreed that this question was very important; but he did not think it was decided one way or the other by the Air Agreement. If an unprovoked air attack took place, results would follow, and it would not make any
difference if the. attack was in accordance with the rules of war or not, provided, it was unprovoked. The question as to whether operations should-be conducted in accordance with the so-called &quot; rules of war&quot;; would be a matter for Government decision at the time. He doubted if the question could be considered in the abstract.SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD said that for the first time for two years the Chiefs of Staff had found they were not unanimous. He and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff felt that this question would really make no difficulties in connection with the Air Pact, but that there was a definite danger, in the present mentality of the world which was being led to expect the most horrible things, that they would happen automatically unless steps were taken to alter the position. This would be a most dangerous precedent, and they had felt that it was better to frame rules now that indiscriminate bombing was not legitimate. In the last war we had been saved by the humanitarian rules which had been laid down in regard to the treatment of merchant shipping. It had taken Germany two years to make up her mind to proceed with unrestricted submarine warfare, which had given us time to make our preparations. If Germany had started in 1914 with this type of warfare, we might have been defeated. It was felt that we ought to make a Convention which would definitely establish the fact that unrestricted bombing was illegal. This might cause a country to hesitate before taking action of this kind which might result in bringing the antagonism and odium of all world opinion on top of them. It was also felt that since the air provided the only way in which we could be attacked in our homes, there was tremendous advantage in trying to do something which might avoid unrestricted warfare against the civil population.SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD entirely agreed and thought the opportunity ought to be taken of trying to get a clause that bombing of open towns and civilians was not a part of legitimate warfare.SIE EDWARD ELLINGTON said his view was that the question did not arise on the Air Pact. Even if there was agreement to certain rules, it did not mean that the air menace would be removed, but if an attempt was made to link it up with the air proposal then he was afraid that no agreement would ever be reached on anything. The question of rules of air warfare had been under consideration since 1922, and so far no agreement had been reached. He did not in the least wish to oppose any reasonable rules, but he felt that to attempt to negotiate such rules in connection with the proposed Air Pact would cause tremendous delay and might, in fact, mean that no agreement would ever be reached.SIS ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD said it was not suggested that rules should be drawn up at the present time, but just that a paragraph should be inserted in the Convention whereby there was a prohibition of bombing of civilians and open towns.SIR EDWARD ELLINGTON said if this was done, it would surely be necessary to define an open town.SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL thought that one of the most important matters which it had always been agreed we ought to try to prevent was that of indiscriminate bombing. He could not help feeling that public opinion might take a very serious view of the position unless something was done about it.LORD HAILSHAM said he agreed with what Sir John Simon had said, but he did not think this was quite the point of the two Chiefs of Staff. They said that now there was a Pact being negotiated between a number of civilised countries relating to air warfare, a great opportunity was provided for dealing with the question of unrestricted air bombing. The bombing of London was a real danger which would have the most tremendous moral effect, and was a danger which it was most necessary to safeguard. He thought the position might be extremely difficult, and perhaps even foolish, unless in this first Air Pact, it was stated plainly that, in the view of the five great Powers concerned, this form of warfare should be outlawed. The example of the United States entry into the last war was a very good one which might be repeated again in different circum-;; i-stances.   It was very important to set a standard in the eyes of the world against
which any country might hesitate to embark on indiscriminate, slaughter. He agreed it was hot possible to define what was a civilian or an open town any more than an attempt could be&apos;made to define the aggressor, but he thought there was every advantage in having a good broad statement that the bombing of open towns and civilians was forbidden, and getting the countries concerned to. sign a solemn pledge that this would not be done.MR. THOMAS entirely agreed, and said this was a thing which would undoubtedly greatly appeal to the public, and might also help to carry the other proposal.LORD LONDONDERRY could not help feeling that if just a broad princi-ple was laid down it might be torn to ribbons. He agreed with Sir Edward Ellington that to open discussions on this particular point might prejudice the conclusion of any pact at all.MR. THOMAS still thought there was tremendous value from the point of view of the public in putting forward this proposal, even if it failed. The country who opposed it would then stand out in relief. He believed also that Herr Hitler had said he would support a suggestion of this kind.SIR JOHN SIMON said that on the basis which the discussion had taken, he thought the criticisms which he had put forward at the start were not perhaps well founded. There was, of course, no idea of making this proposal a condition of agreement of the Air Pact, but it was merely an effort to try and get it included in the course of the negotiations.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that a recommendation to this effect might go to the Cabinet, together with the recommendations on Part 2 (A).Conclusions on Items 2 (A) and 2 (B). The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a) that the technical comments on the workability of the proposed Aerial Convention should be taken note of, and should not be overlooked in any negotiations on the subject of the Convention;(&amp;) that it is desirable that the suggested Aerial Convention should come into operation only at the same time as agreement is reached on the other subjects, such as an armaments agreement and security, dealt with in the first part of the Joint Anglo-French communique of the 3rd February;(c) that an attempt should be made to include in the proposed AerialConvention a prohibition of the indiscriminate bombing of open towns;(d) that these minutes and papers should be forwarded to the Cabinet.-7T tv&quot; &quot;Ti- *7v -Jr2 Whitehall Gardens, S.

DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1935.SECRET. CoPy No-1161-B.[Also Paper No. COS. 364.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.FRENCFI AIR PROPOSALS FOR A TREATY OF mutual guarantee.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.Introduction.1. A PROPOSAL was put forward by M. Flandin and M. Laval during the Anglo-French conversations held on Friday, the 1st February, 1935, for a treaty of mutual guarantee in case of air attack. The actual scheme submitted by the French Delegation was in the following form : &quot; The High Contracting Parties, recognising that the methods of aerial warfare render necessary especially prompt action in order to assure an effective repression of any aggression committed by way of the air, and recognising in consequence that the assistance assured to the State victim of such an aggression must be immediate, would agree to recommend the conclusion of regional agreements of mutual assistance, the signatories of which would undertake, without prejudice to decisions which might be taken by the Council of the League of Nations under Article 16 of the Covenant, immediately to give the assistance of their air forces to whichever of them might be the victim of an unprovoked aggression by way of the air by one of the contracting parties.II.With a view to the regional application in Western Europe of the provision set out above, Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain (and Italy), signatories of the Treaty signed at Locarno on the 16th October, 1925, would undertake to give the immediate assistance of their aerial forces to whichever of the Contracting States might be the victim of an unprovoked aggression by way of the air on the part of another of the Contracting States.&quot;2. This proposal, which was laid on the table by the French Delegation without previous warning, was remitted to us for a report from the military and strategic point of view. We held three meetings accordingly on the 2nd, 4th and 5th February, 1935, and considered the implications of this proposal, and our considered opinion thereon is contained in succeeding paragraphs.[11149] B
The Implications of the French Proposals.3. We understand that the French proposal arose in connection with the discussion of a formula with which the German Government might be approached. Jn particular, this formula was to contain the provision that, if a general settle-ment could be reached by the Powers concerned, the abrogation of those provisions of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles limiting the arms and armed forces of Germany, should form part of the settlement.4. The French Delegation were unwilling to accept this&apos; proposal to abrogate Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, even though it was made conditional on a number of other matters, without obtaining some further guarantee of security from us in case of attack by Germany; and, in order to get this security, the French Delegation were willing to offer us reciprocal action if Germany should attack the United Kingdom.5. We note that, for the first time, a suggestion has been made to give a guarantee to us in certain eventualities, and we appreciate fully the importance of this concession.6. The French proposal involves a definite extension of the Treaty of Locarno, clause 3 of Article 4 of which reads as follows : .&apos;&apos; In case of flagrant violation of Article 2 of the present Treaty, or of a flagrant breach of Articles 42 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles by one of the High Contracting Parties, each of the other Contracting Parties hereby undertakes immediately to come to the help of the party against whom such a violation or breach has been directed as soon as the said Power has been able to satisfy itself that this violation constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression and that, by reason either of the crossing of the frontier or of the outbreak of hostilities or of the assembly of armed forces in the demilitarised zone, immediate action is necessary.....&quot;7. The Treaty of Locarno thus contains a saving clause and places the responsibility for the final decision to enter the war on each country concerned. The French proposal contains no such provision except in so far as it can be read into the word &quot;unprovoked.&quot; It would, in fact, be an antithesis of the whole proposal if any such latitude was allowed, as is shown by the remarks of M. Flandin at the meeting held on the morning of the 1st February, 1935 :-&apos;&apos; Lastly, as regards guarantees of execution, the French Government must, in the event of aggression, have the security that the guarantors of Locarno would intervene rapidly.In the view of the technicians, a war of aggression would open up an aerial attack which would have a character of great rapidity. Eight hours would be sufficient to mobilise an aerial attack. Thus it was certain that any delay for consultation would involve risks of a mortal character for the attacked country. Before the guarantors could intervene, the end of the war might have been decided.&quot;8. In effect, therefore, the proposal as visualised by the French amounts to an automatic guarantee and any signatory thereto would be bound to come into the war if aerial aggression of any kind was to take place. There would be no option and there would almost certainly be no time in which to assess the factors or to arrive at a considered judgment on the merits or demerits of the situation. The action of some irresponsible commander or agent provocateur might precipitate war in which all the guarantors would be immediately involved. It is clear that this proposal is intended by the French to have an irrevocable implication which was absent from the Treaty of Locarno. It would preclude the employment of any of the peace machinery already in existence, or even such diplomatic action as would normally be taken before a final resort to war.9. If, on the other hand, it is to be assumed that none of the signatories will act without being satisfied that the aggression is unprovoked, this would lead to delays in the execution of the Treaty and would certainly not provide the French with the security they seek as the full force of the retaliation would not be immediate or unanimous.
Military Commitments implied in the Pact.10. The French proposals are specifically concerned with &quot; aggression by way of the air&quot; and lay down that the immediate assistance of aerial forces should be given in the case of necessity. No mention is made of the employment of the other two Defence Services. Prima facie, this is another difference from the Treaty of Locarno which does not prescribe what forces shall be employed in rendering assistance to the country attacked. In actual practice, however, an. aggression that brings the air force into operation under the proposed pact will inevitably bring the provisions of the Locarno Treaty into operation, and in any event it is obvious, as we have pointed out on several occasions before, that it is not possible to limit war to one particular arm of the Defence Forces. Once war has broken out, inevitably the whole strength of a country must be thrown into the scales. There is, therefore, a difference between the French proposals and the Treaty of Locarno, the former applying to aerial aggression, while the latter covers all forms of aggression.11. Admittedly, the danger from air attack is serious, and the characteristics of air forces would enable them to deliver the initial attacks with far greater rapidity than would be the case with land forces. For example, the Germans in 1914 took about eight days to mobilise before delivering their first attacks, whereas to-day it is probable that air attack on a heavy scale could be delivered within eight hours of the decision to do so.12. This leads us to the further point as to the actual measure of the risk to this country of air attack by Germany in the future. This is partly dependent upon political factors, but from the purely military point of view we are of the opinion, which we have previously expressed, that the risk of air attack by Germany directed solely against this country is small. We believe that there is more risk that we may be drawn into a war as the result of hostilities between France and Germany in the first&apos; instance. From this point of view, the guarantee that we are giving to France is more valuable to her than that which we receive in return. At the same time it may well be argued that we are bound to come to the assistance of France or Belgium in our own interests however they are attacked.13. We do not wish to minimise the serious effects which might be experienced if London and other parts of the country were subjected to heavy bombing attacks. The risk of military and industrial disorganisation and the effect on the morale of the population are factors of great importance and have caused us, and continue to cause us, grave concern. But, as we have already said, we believe the greater initial risk is to France and not to us.14. A further point is the danger that, under the French proposals, we might be drawn into war through French commitments in Eastern and Central Europe. Even though, as we understand, it is not the intention that we should become involved in other countries&apos; commitments, we wish to stress our serious concern as to whether our position can, in practice, be properly safeguarded both from the legal and moral point of view. The implications of the latter, in particular, may have a most important bearing on this point.15. In accordance with the French proposal, immediate assistance is to be given to the party which has been the object of the attack. The French Govern-ment have been anxious.for many years to have military conversations with us, and the conclusion of a pact of this nature will, we presume, serve to strengthen their demands. Although it would be possible, without previous consultation, to implement effectively our obligation to the Germans by operating from aerodromes in this country if the French were the aggressors, to bring effective aid to the French would involve the despatch overseas of air forces, and the necessary preparations would involve discussions with the French. This raises the difficulty that conversations with France alone would be unfair to the other signatories, and conversations with all the signatories would clearly be out of the question.16.   In considering the whole problem it is also necessary to review our Imperial position.   The situation in the Far East is still a cause of anxiety, particularly since the year 1936 is the beginning of a period when Japan will be [11149] ^ b 2
specially favourably placed as regards the relative strength of her armed forces. We are most anxious that the preoccupations of Europe should not cause any -distortion of the whole defence picture. In the Defence Requirements -Committee&apos;s Report, and in other papers, we have envisaged the risk in the Far East to be a near one and the risk in Europe to be a long-range one. Up to the present we have not received any information which has caused us to alter., our -opinion; but the fact that Germany is much nearer to this country than Japan tends possibly to an exaggeration of the imminence of the German menace.17. Again, without in any way wishing to minimise the ultimate potentialities of Germany, we would urge that the broad principles on which our Empire strategy has always been based should not be forgotten, nor should the lessons of history be overlooked. The greater our commitments in Europe, the less will be our ability to secure our Empire and its communications without increasing defence expenditure beyond anything that has been required in the past. On the other hand, we would welcome any agreements, or methods, by which a reduction, or even a limitation, of armaments in Europe could be achieved, because they would enable us to devote more resources to our other Imperial interests.18. Finally, we would add that, while we are fully conscious of the political and psychological advantages which might accrue from the French proposal, we have considered it our duty to confine ourselves to the purely military implications of that proposal which are, perhaps, less obvious.General Conclusion.19. Our general conclusions on the French proposals may be summarised -as follows : , . That unless our impressions are mistaken we shall be committed to take air action in other words we shall be plunged into war with all our forces without the present safeguard contained in paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno.That although it may be the intention to safeguard us from being involved in war as a result of the commitments of other signatories to the Pact (but with which the Pact is not concerned), there may be difficulty in providing the necessary safeguards.That this country is less likely than France to have to face single-handed air attack by Germany, which implies that we are more likely to be drawn into war on behalf of France than France is on our behalf.That while we appreciate the value to us of some definite guarantee against what may be a grave menace in the future, we think that we are being asked to pay a high price, from the military point of view, for such added security as we may receive. .....Relation of the proposed guarantee treaty to an armaments settlement.20. We strongly recommend that the proposed guarantee treaty! should not be concluded, or at any rate ratified, until the armaments part of the settle-ment has been negotiated. This would be consistent with -the simultaneous character of the general settlement, of which it forms an integral part.The Possibility of a Defence Alliance.21. It appears to us, from a military point of view using military in its widest sense that a defensive alliance with France (which would obviously have to include Belgium) would give us the added security contained in the French proposals without some of the disadvantages that these proposals entail. Nor would it appear that any such treaty would be less acceptable to Germany than the French proposals. Sir Eric Phipps, in a telegram from Berlin dated the 29th April, 1934 (No. 101), said as follows : &apos;&apos; You will remember that the Chancellor has declared himself to be quite ready even to agree to an Anglo-French defensive alliance.&quot;
We feel; from a military point of view, that in a defensive alliance we should definitely gain as much in security as we should be asked to give, which, as we have endeavoured to show, is not the position under the French proposals.22. From a naval point of view also, such an alliance would have1 great advantages-for example, in strengthening the total naval forces on which we could rely in European waters, and thus showing the world that we are no longer hampered in Imperial defence by our European responsibilities. A Franco-British alliance is admittedly not compatible with a Naval Disarmament Treaty. But Treaty negotiations may break down, and then our naval position would be greatly strengthened by such an alliance. There are other advantages which can be deployed, if and when the time comes to consider this proposal in detail.(Signed) ERNLE CFIATFIELD.A. A. MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD. E. L.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1935.SECRET. Copy No.1162-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE PROPOSED AIR BOMBING CONVENTION.Memorandum by the Secretary to the Cabinet and Committee ofImperial Defence.APART from the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, which deals with, the military aspects of the proposed Air Bombing Convention, no general appreciation of the proposal has yet been circulated. In this Memorandum, which was begun immediately after the proposal was tabled, an attempt has been made to analyse it step by step from that central politico-military point of view which pertains to the Committee of Imperial Defence.2. Owing to other unescapable duties I was unable to co-operate as Secretary in the studies of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee until after their Report had reached an advanced stage. I ask their indulgence if I have touched on some of the same points as they, though as a rule this has been to reinforce their conclusions.3. It will be remembered that an almost identical proposal, though intended for adoption by all European countries, was formulated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs last May* and brought before the Cabinet as a matter of urgency, together with a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air,t strongly opposing the proposal. The Cabinet, on the 16th May, \ referred the question to the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament (Defence Requirements), who devoted a whole meeting to it on the following day, the 17th May, and came to the conclusion &apos;&apos; that there were great difficulties in putting forward a European Convention against air bombardment in a form which we could recommend either as practicable or acceptable to public opinion in this country. . . . .&quot;\4. The proposal was then dropped. A statement on the above lines was included in the Report of the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements, II which was approved as a whole by the Cabinet on the 31st July, 1934.11 The discussions are very fully recorded, and it is possible that Ministers might like to refresh their memory on the subject. It will be found that the original decision to drop the proposal was based on a fairly exhaustive examination.II.5. Apart from the possible promotion of a settlement with Germany, including an armaments limitation, the advantages claimed for the proposed Pact may be summarised as follows : (1) It should provide a great security to the United Kingdom in the eventof a bombing attack by Germany; (2) It should provide a powerful deterrent against aggression by any of theparties;(3) It should induce a feeling of confidence in this country and abroad, and pacification to Europe.* CP. 137 (34). g D.C. (M) (32), 46th Conclusions. &quot;I CP. 138 (34). II CP. 205 (34), paragraphs 22-24.I Cabinet 21 (34), Conclusion 2... ... -.............. ...        Cabinet 31 (34), Conclusion 1.[11186] B
6. The three alleged advantages are largely interdependent. If there is a real advantage in the Treaty then the deterrent effect will be great. If the advantage is not as great as it appears at first sight this will become apparent in due course, and the deterrent will be less. And the extent to which Europe will be pacified will depend on the view generally held as to (1) and (2). The most important factor in the above situation is whether the Treaty is likely to work in practice and to prove reliable. This involves both political and practical considerations, and to the former of these attention will now be directed.III.7. The new Treaty is closely linked up with the Locarno Treaty. In fact, it was claimed by both British and French Ministers during the Anglo-French Conversations that the Treaty does not extend our commitment under Locarno, and this has since been said in public. The Chiefs of Staff, however, have given reasons to show that it does extend our commitments. Although the question is not quite relevant to the one we are considering the reliability of the Treaty it may be convenient to deal with it at this point.8. After the conclusion of the Locarno Treaty the Defence Departments were not allowed to work out their plans or to tune up their organisation to give effect to it. Notwithstanding that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Commitee drew attention to the matter year after year in their Annual Reviews, it was not -deemed necessary even to make a beginning in equipping the Services to fulfil the guarantee, for the reason that the Locarno Convention was always treated as a Peace Convention rather than a War Convention. As in the case of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the British Government tended to relegate the element of sanctions in the Locarno Treaty to the background. But if the proposed Aerial Bombing Convention is ever concluded, the first essential will be the provision of large air forces tuned up to the highest pitch of readiness, and as any war which brought the Pact into operation would at once become general the same is true of the older Services. Can it seriously be argued that a Treaty, the essence of which is preparedness for immediate action, is not an extension of a Treaty which was not held to involve preparation for war; that a Treaty where military preparedness is in the forefront does not involve an extension of a Treaty where it was in the background ? Whatever may be the position as regards legal obligation, from the practical point of view of the Defence Services and of the taxpayer the extension of the commitment is very considerable!9. Coming back, after this diversion, to the question of whether the Treaty will prove reliable, it will first be useful to consider how far the Locarno Treaty (to which, whether involving an extension or not, it is appended) has been successful.10. The benefits that were to be obtained by the Locarno Treaty are set forth in the Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference in the following terms : &apos;&apos; The representatives of the Governments here declare their firm conviction that the entry into force of these Treaties and Conventions will contribute greatly to bring about a moral relaxation of the tension between nations, that it will help powerfully towards the solution of many political or economic problems in accordance with the interests and sentiments of peoples, and that, in strengthening peace and security in Europe, it will hasten on effectively the disarmament provided for in Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.They undertake to give their sincere co-operation to work relating to disarmament already undertaken by the League of Nations and to seek the realisation thereof in a general agreement.&quot;11. In all these respects the Locarno Treaty has now broken down. During the first two or three years some success was achieved, after which the Locarno spirit evaporated. Since 1930 there has been neither &quot; a moral relaxation of the tension between nations,&quot; nor &quot; the solution of many political or economic problems.&quot;&apos;&apos; nor a strengthening of &quot;peace and security in Europe,&quot; nor a hastening on of disarmament, nor &apos;&apos; sincere co-operation to work relating to disarmament&quot; by signatories. &apos;;&apos;&quot;.&quot; 11 &apos;
IV.15. This leads us to a second political consideration bearing on the reliability of the proposed Guarantee Pact, namely, as to whether any democratic country, and particularly France, can be counted on for more than a year or two to honour such an engagement. The fact that we ourselves came into the War in fulfilment of our ancient guarantee of Belgian independence may be quoted as a favourable precedent. But it was a case where interest coincided with legal obligation. As has been pointed out in the preceding section, popular opinion changes so rapidly that it is hardly doubtful that, in 1935, public opinion could not be induced to allow the Government to give effect to the &apos;&apos; flagrant aggression&quot; clause of the Locarno Treaty of 1925. Nevertheless, a British guarantee is probably worth more than a French or Italian. The French and Italians are not easy bed-fellows in political matters. A good many examples could be given of the occasions on which we have had to protest against French breach of faith in peace and war.   The classical examples of recent times are : (1) The Italian desertion of the Triple Alliance.(2) The Chanak incident, when the French and Italians walked out of the trenches and left us to face the Turkish army alone.&quot; On the 18th September orders from Paris withdrew the French detach-ments from the side of their British comrades at Chanak and on the Isinid Peninsula. The French troops were accompanied in their retirement by the Italians, and the British Empire was left alone to face the advancing Turkish armies. The advertised departure of the soldiers of these two Great Powers was likely to influence the wildest ambitions of the Turks.&quot;(Churchill: The World Crisis: the Aftermath, Chapter XIX.)(3) The French occupation of the Ruhr contrary to the Treaty of Versailles in January 1923, in spite of our protests of illegality, and after we had, at least once (in 1920) dissuaded them from similar action.In the case of trade agreements (coal, for example), there have been recent instances of French unreliability, to say nothing of their action in respect of payment of interest to British subscribers to the French war loans.16. The truth is that if it is to France&apos;s interest to come to our assistance she can be relied on to do so whether there is a Treaty or not. If it is not to her interest at the time, she will not do so. Nations will not put their back into the business, nor submit themselves to the horrors of modern warfare, except under the stimulus of some overpowering motive, such as security or national ambition. [11186] B 212. Even the &apos;&apos; sanctions &quot;provisions, of the Locarno Treaty hang at present precariously in the balance. . One of the events that bring the &quot;flagrant violation &quot; provisions of the Treaty into operation is a flagrant breach of Articles 42 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles; in other words, the construction of fortifications or the maintenance and assembly of armed forces in the demilitarised zone. Any time within the next year or two the Germans may re-occupy the demilitarised zone and proceed to fortify it. In fact, Hitler has threatened something of the kind within the last few days (Berlin telegrams Nos. 39 and 40).13. It is almost certain that when matters come to this point none of the signatories of the Locarno Treaty will be prepared to take action. In this country the position would be particularly difficult if the French Government called on us to co-operate. Many people in the United Kingdom would say that Hitler was quite right. Still more would say that it was no affair of ours. Few would be ready to risk their own lives or those of their kith and kin, or to embroil the nation in a European war for this reason.14. At the very moment when the Locarno &quot;sanction&quot; is breaking down owing to the overwhelming pressure of public opinion, it seems extraordinary that we should be entering on a new and much more onerous commitment of the same kind, which points and sharpens all those aspects of Locarno that are most unpopular.
17. Yet another political reason which may render either ourselves or the other Governments concerned incapable of fulfilling the Treaty is the possibility of preoccupations elsewhere. If we were engaged in, or threatened with, a war involving the possibility of the loss of the whole of our Possessions, interests and trade in the Far East,* we might be so hard pressed that we could not involve ourselves in a Continental commitment. Alternatively, France may find herself, when the moment arrives, in the position of a year or two ago, when M. Doumergue, on taking office, stated that the political distractions of the country were such (after the Staviski incident) that the defence of the Republic against foreign aggression was endangered. There are still apprehensions in France lest such a position should again be reached.18. The probability is that Germany will never attack France, England or Belgium in normal times. She will await the favourable moment when one or other, owing to external or internal preoccupations, such as those referred to above, cannot be counted on to take action. The number of signatories to the Aerial Bombing Convention will be so small that the non-co-operation of any one of them will deprive it of almost all its value. If we cannot, or will not, give effect to it, France and Belgium are left in the lurch for no one will expect much help from Italy. If France cannot, or will not, co-operate, we are left in the lurch alone with Belgium.19. It may be said that much of this criticism can be directed against the Locarno Treaty. This is true, and the failure of the Locarno Treaty was anticipated by some people. It is because the Locarno Treaty has failed in its main objects and is in danger of a collapse of its &quot; sanctions &quot; provisions that grave doubts must be felt as to whether it is wise to bolster up the Locarno idea ^vith the suggested Bombing Convention.VI.20. During the Anglo-French Conversations the question was more than once raised with British Ministers and Officials of the Foreign Office as to whether the proposed guarantee would cover the case where Germany bombs London owing to our refusal to surrender a colony almost the only possible (if rather remote) cause of a direct quarrel between Germany and ourselves. The reply was that the Guarantee Pact would be brought into operation not by the cause of the dispute, but by the act of unprovoked bombing. In considering the degree of reliability to be attached to the Pact, however, the point is of some importance. France and Belgium might rightly feel that their own security was not really endangered in this case, and that Germany would only exhaust herself by war against an obstinate and tenacious Empire in possession of command of the sea. They would also have very little interest in a dispute as to the ownership of a British Colony, and public opinion might oppose being precipitated into a European war for such a cause. They would perhaps claim that our refusal to surrender a colony was itself a &quot; provocation.&quot;21. The point is also of some importance because, it is understood, France is not to receive the benefit of the British guarantee if an unprovoked bombing attack is launched against her in the case where she is embroiled owing to her Treaties with Eastern European countries. In this case, therefore, a different principle applies. Whereas France has to fulfil the guarantee in the case of an Anglo-German dispute over a colony, the United Kingdom does not fulfil its guarantee in a dispute over French commitments and interests in Eastern Europe. When that is realised it will make French public opinion still less likely to intervene in a dispute over a British colony or territory under the mandate of the United Kingdom or a Dominion.22. Another point that arises in connection with France&apos;s commitments in Eastern Europe is that it is quite possible that France may have a quarrel of her* The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, like the Defence requirements Committee last year, :regard the Far Eastern danger as the more immediate (CCS. 364, paragraph 16). From his recent speeches it is evident that General Smuts regards it also as a long-range danger.
own with Germany simultaneously with the troubles in Eastern Europe. British, support will be so important to her in such a case that she is almost bound to work for a situation in which she can claim that a German act of unprovoked bombing arose, not out of the Eastern European dispute, but out of her own dispute, and that, consequently, we are bound to intervene. It will be an admirable opportunity for those &quot; shock tactics &quot; of which French Ministers gave such a conspicuous example on the 1st and 2nd February.23. The above all tends to show that, from a political point of view and in the light even of post-war history, there are strong reasons for doubting whether reliance can be placed on the proposed Aerial Bombing Guarantee Treaty.VII.24. We come now to the practical working of the plan. Immediate action as contemplated by the air bombing guarantee presupposes plans and preparations, and these will have to be concerted with our allies. As the Chiefs of Staff point out, that inevitably involves conversations.25. Here we encounter an extraordinary difficulty, because it is virtually impossible to make plans and preparations, in one case with France and Belgium, and in the other case with Germany. If we are to concert our arrangements with France and Belgium, for example, we must know exactly what their plans are and make our own plans to fit in with them. Having worked out our plans with France and Belgium, we shall have then to work them out with Germany unless we take Germany first. In the former case we make our plans with Germany knowing what the Franco-Belgian plan is; or, if Germany comes first, we make our plans with France,and Belgium knowing what the German plan is. It is submitted that this is an impossible position for our Defence Services. To quote a remark of Lord Balfour&apos;s in a well-known telegram from Washington : &quot; For a task so complex as this I fear a trained diplomatist is required.&quot;26. This difficulty of making plans with two nations was one of the complications which stood in the way of plans being made to give effect to the Locarno Treaty, and it is far more difficult and yet far more essential in the case of the Pact now proposed.  It appears to present an insurmountable obstacle.27. On the other hand, if there are no plans, effective action cannot be taken within a few hours and there will be chaos. In other words, this reciprocal arrangement cannot, in fact, be made effective by the guarantor for both the guaranteed parties.28. In theory plans ought to be worked out for the case where Belgium bombs Germany or France, but presumably none of the parties to the Treaty would insist on that.29. A more disagreeable thought is that sooner or later France and Germany and Belgium will be making plans against the United Kingdom and the British Empire !  It may put ideas into their heads.30. Statesmen are in a better position than I to measure the effect on European opinion of all these visits of officers between the different countries, the reconnaissances of aerodromes, ports, entraining and detraining stations, &amp;c, the fact of which will be reported widely in the press, on the radio and before long by television. Will it not result in a morbid contemplation by the public of horrors to come ?VIII.31. Let us assume, however, that the difficulty of concerting plans has been solved in some degree; that the Pact is in existence, and that one day the dreaded bombing attack is delivered. The attacked nation, of. course, appeals to us to put our guarantee in operation without delay on the ground that the bombing attack was unprovoked. The attacking nation, just as much as a matter of course, urges provocation and produces evidence to support, the claim. In the case of the Locarno Treaty it was realised that this was a difficult question, and even in the event of &quot;flagrant aggression&quot; provision was made that action&apos;by the offended party would only be taken &quot; as soon as the said.  [11186]       ^ - &apos;H ^ &apos;&quot;&apos; n 3 a
Power has been able to satisfy itself that this violation constitutes an unprovoked act; of aggression. .;. ;. .&quot; The following passage horn Hansard (Volume..188, 1924-25, p. 427) shows that if was recognised that this would require some time:-&quot; &apos;&quot;;    &apos; &apos;&apos; *     - - - &quot; &apos;       &quot; . -&quot; Mr. Ramsay MacDonald : Is each guarantor separately to assess itsown responsibility, or are the guarantors jointly to meet to assess joint responsibility ? .Mr. Chamberlain : I have no doubt that, as a matter of practice, the two guarantors would at once exchange views upon the situation. Indeed, I think it is probable that the Powers which are guaranteed will be anxious to know what views the guarantors take of the situation before they themselves take action.....&quot;It was therefore at that time contemplated that there would at any rate be time for an exchange of views between the Powers concerned.32. In the case of the arrangement now proposed, however, the time allowed for checking whether the bombing was unprovoked is practically nil, for retaliation for the offence is to be immediate.IX.33. One of the principal difficulties with which the Government will be confronted at such a time is that either side, or both sides, will resort to stratagems and chicaneries. This possibility has hitherto been dismissed too lightly. History shows that ruses are almost the normal procedure of a nation bent on war.  Here are two pre-war examples : 1864. The Austro-Prussian War against Denmark.&quot; To prevent this possibility &quot; (namely, a European Conference whichwould have arrested the coming war) &quot;Bismarck made the Copenhagen ; Government believe that England had threatened Prussia with intervention :   in the event of hostilities being opened, though, as a matter of fact, Englanddid nothing of the kind.   The ruse succeeded;   Denmark remained defiant;and on the 1st February, 1864, the Austrian and Prussian forces crossed the Eider. &quot;*The Ems Telegram.In 1870 the German Kaiser, who was staying at Ems, sent an account of a conversation he had had with the French Ambassador. The first part of the telegram, taken by itself, pointed to the probability of war, but the last sentence indicated that negotiations would continue. Bismarck cut out the last passage and published the warlike portion of the telegram only.&apos;&apos; On the 14th July the publication of the &apos; Ems Telegram &apos; became known in Paris, with the result that Bismarck had anticipated. . . .;. On the evening of the same day, the 14th Juty, the declaration of war was signed, &quot;t and France became the apparent aggressor.34. The following examples, furnished by Brigadier-General Sir J. E. Edmonds, the author of The Official History, Military Operations, are even more apposite : &quot; The German Official History of the War, Volume I, pp. 104-5, has in two lengthy footnotes given the alleged violations of German territory by the French before declaration of war. Most of them refer to reconnoitring parties (one of which is stated to have blown up a railway bridge); but the following aeroplane incidents are given : &quot; On the 29th July French aeroplanes flew over the frontier at Gottesthal, east of Belfort.&quot;In the night of the 2nd/3rd August came the report of the throwing of air bombs at Nuremberg.&quot; (I believe the origin of this was that an : aeroplane did fly over Nuremberg probably a German one.)-*:Alison Phillips ModemiEuropfi&apos; Cap. L3. --. .... ,..f I hid. Cap. 18. &apos;    ;
&quot; In the official Austrian publication (title translated) Austro-Hungarian Foreign Policy from, the Bosnian Crisis in 1908 to the Outbreak of War in 1914, the following occurs under the 27th July (No. 10855) :-&quot; &apos; Count Berchtold informed the Emperor: &quot;According to a report from the IV Corps, Serbian troops have fired from Danube steamers on the troops near Temes Kubin, and on this being replied to, a general action had developed.  Hostilities are therefore actually opened.&quot; &apos;&quot; Count Berchtold by this means obtained the (Austrian) Kaiser&apos;s signature to the declaration of war by Austria, giving the incident as one of the principal causes of the declaration of war. Count Berchtold subsequently struck out the paragraph, merely reporting to the Kaiser on the 29th July (No. 11015) :-&quot; &apos; The reports of the fighting at Temes Kubin have not been confirmed. On the contrary, only an isolated report of trifling firing near Gradiste. As this does not appear to be suitable grounds for an Act of State, in hopes of receiving your retrospective approval, I have taken on myself to eliminate from the Declaration of War sent to Serbia the sentence about the attack of the Serbian troops near Temes Kubin.&apos; &quot;It should particularly be noted that it is only since the war that this fact has come to light.35. That Germans have not lost their predilection for ruses of the above character is shown by the fact that not long ago, in order to justify the creation of an &quot; aerial police,&quot; the German Government announced that Communist leaflets had been dropped from an aeroplane over Berlin. There seems to have been considerable doubt as to whether in fact there were either aeroplanes or leaflets!36. The above example illustrates the atmosphere in which the guarantor will have to decide at the shortest notice the critically important question of peace or war, and sheds light on the mentality of the people with whom he will be dealing.IX.37. The real difficulty, however, which has now to be faced is as to how evidence is to be obtained as to whether the act of bombing is &apos;&apos; provoked &apos;&apos; or &quot;unprovoked.&quot; It is reasonable to assume an atmosphere of electrical tension on both sides of the German frontier: censorship in force; frontiers closed; all the conditions that normally precede an outbreak of war. Those of us who experienced at the centre the first days of August 1914 will never forget the bewildering mass of information and rumour that poured in day and night from every part of Europe. Since then radio adds a new instrument to the armoury -of tendentious propaganda, and television will soon be available. It is in such conditions that the aerial bombing attack is likely to be delivered. It is certain that each side will make a different claim as to whether the attack was provoked or unprovoked. Action by both parties might be so close in time as to be almost simultaneous. It will not be possible to obtain independent confirmation within a few hours. The only direct source of evidence will be that of the officers commanding the respective forces, and even they may well be liable to make mistakes. That Continental military officers are not always unbiased or actuated by the highest motives when on the verge of war is illustrated by the following episode, which took place on the 31st July, 1914 : &quot; One final scene as described by Conrad is typical of the whole process. On the 31st July, 1914, there was still a faint chance of peace. Sir Edward Grey had proposed direct negotiations between Austria and Russia, and the Kaiser and Bethmann-Hollweg had for a moment seemed disposed to agree, but on the morning of that day Moltke in Berlin telegraphed to Conrad in Vienna : &apos; Austria must at once mobilize against Russia, Germany will mobilize.&apos; On the same morning the Austrian Military Attache also wired from Berlin : &apos; Moltke says the situation is critical unless Austria mobilizes at once against Russia. Refuse England&apos;s new peace offer. For Austria-Hungary it is the only way of preventing the European War.   Germany
aunconditionally with you.&apos; And again in. the afternoon Moltke telegraphed: &apos; Will Austria leave Germany in the lurch?&apos; AH this was apparently unknown to the German Chancellor, who was nominally in charge of the negotiations, and who protested afterwards that he was absolutely honest in supporting the British proposal to restore the wires between Vienna and St. Petersburg. &apos; Who is in command ? &apos; asked Berchtold, the Austrian Minister, who was hot for war, but he appears to have had no difficulty in concluding that &apos; with these satisfactory assurances from the highest military authority in Germany,&apos; he was at liberty to go his own way and refuse England&apos;s new peace offer.   So ended the last chance of peace.38. Specious but academic plans will, of course, be produced for stationing observers, military and air attaches, &amp;c, in the capitals of all the countries con-cerned to report on what is happening. But the observers will be the last people to be told anything. They will know no more of the facts than did the diplomats in Copenhagen in 1864, of at Ems in 1870. There is no harder task, and none requiring more patient research, than the establishment of the facts about an aggression. Even in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute (where Italian aircraft are admitted to have already been used for reconnaissance purposes, t the difficulty of fixing the aggressor has been admitted by the Foreign Office. On this point it may be said with confidence that the air guarantee pact is bound to break down, if only owing to the lack of time to establish the facts.X.39. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have strongly recommended that the proposed arrangements should not come into operation until a Disarmament Treaty has been arrived at. This appears to be extraordinarily important from two points of view.40. First, unless there is an Armaments Treaty it would appear almost certain that the French would insist on a military treaty fixing the armaments of the three Western countries. Otherwise they would run the risk that we would not be prepared to provide an effective assistance. A new Government might come into office which. would take a totally different view of our armaments position from that of the present Government a fact to which the French will be fully alive. Even from our own point of view, also, if we are to be committed to war on something approaching an automatic event, it is important that we should be sure of the forces of our allies. The same would apply between Germany and ourselves. Hence, the armaments of the four countries at any rate would have to be in some kind of relation. Everyone knows how difficult that would be to arrange. Germany, for instance, has to take Russia, Poland and Jugo-Slavia into account; and France, Italy, and Italy both France and Jugo-Slavia. That is probably why French Ministers in public declarations since the London Conference have insisted that there must be a complete Disarmament Treaty.41. A second reason is that without the lever of this Pact we are liable again to get bogged in all the intricacies of Disarmament. At the outset of the London Conversations the French laid on the table papers which were not discussed, in which they virtually reaffirmed their old attitude on the question of Disarmament, including all those aspects which are most difficult for us, such as the definition of the &quot; aggressor,&quot; control and inspection, including local inspection, of armaments, publicity, and so forth. If the Pact is withheld until after a Disarma-ment Convention is reached, we shall have a lever to use with the French in order to secure a simpler Convention on our own lines.XL42. On the occasion of my visit to the Dominions I became aware of a good deal of anxiety lest the United Kingdom should accept further commitments in Europe, which was by no means confined to Ministerial circles.43. In South Africa, as I reported at the time, General Hertzog&apos;s attitude distinctly hardened when I came to the danger of aerial attack by Germany and&apos;* A. J. Spender, Fifty Years of-Europe, Chapter XLII.t Foreign Office telegram to Addis Ababa No. 43 -of the 9th February;&apos;also Borne telegram No. 92.of the 11th February, and Addis Ababa telegram No. 36 of the l-2th February.-&apos;
touched on the Belgian question and its relation to our own defence. He reverted at once to the Lord President^ statement in Parliament to the effect that our strategical frontier was on the Rhine. General Hertzog, however, was reassured when I told him that no new commitment was involved beyond Locarno and that we were only looking to the vital interests of our own defence.44. In Australia I received a hint that in my observations on Australian defence I should be careful not to refer to the possibility of co-operation in Europe, as that was a thorny subject. My impression is that in Australia it is widely recognised that the Commonwealths security is bound up with our own, and that, in the last resort at any rate, the Australians, who are very patriotic people, would come to our aid with all their strength if the situation demanded it. At the same time any idea of a campaign in Europe would be most unpopular, and Australian opinion would be reluctant to see us accept further commitments.45. In New Zealand, where I had less opportunity to discuss such matters than in the other Dominions, the general position is one of fervent attachment to the Mother Country, but I have some reason to believe that on the question of European entanglements their attitude does not differ very widely from that of Australia.46. In Canada the situation is much more complicated, and particularly so at the present time, with a bitter General Election pending. The French Canadians, numbering three millions out of nearly eleven millions in the population, to whom must be added large blocks of virtually unabsorbed aliens from Eastern Europe, are strongly opposed to intervention or participation of any kind in a war in Europe or elsewhere. They do not object to our taking our own measures for defence, but there is nothing they dread so much as our becoming involved in another war. Some thinking people there hold that it would mean civil war for Canada, as the clash between those who wished to co-operate and those who did not would be so serious. Anything which is thought to increase our commitments will, I am convinced, be dangerous at the present time in Canada, a Dominion which, if wholeheartedly in our favour, could give us more aid, both in military and air forces and in munitions, than any other.47. Broadly, my impression is that no Dominion Government will go so far as to criticise any decision His Majesty&apos;s Government may take on a matter concerning our own security, but that popular opinion everywhere, except possibly in New Zealand, will, in the long run, regret anything that is regarded as a new commitment. General Smuts&apos;s speech at Cape Town on the 9th February, and his support to the Locarno principle, may have some influence-possibly more in the other Dominions than in South Africa itself. On a long view, however, the objection that will count will be the dread of internal difficulties that will be caused in every Dominion in greater or less degree between those who wish to co-operate and those who do not. Mr. Pirow gave a hint of this in his speech on South African Defence on the 5th February, when he referred to the possibility of civil war if any South African Government attempted :&apos; rashly to commit us to any oversea adventure.&quot; The tendency, therefore, will be the weakening of those intangible bonds that provide the real Imperial link.48. I submit that if, after thorough exploration of the proposed Pact in all its aspects, the Government feel bound to go on with it, they would be well advised, if possible, to await the Silver Jubilee before making progress, in order that the whole matter may be laid before, and explained to, the Dominion Prime Ministers after thorough exploration of all its aspects.XII.49. There remain one or two observations of a general character that could not conveniently be worked into the detailed analysis.50. The first point is that the fundamental principle of the Pact is unsound. It involves m.aking war on a pretext or incident and not on a cause. The nation that perpetrates the unprovoked aggression, or that appears to have done so, or has been tricked into doing so, may be right on the root cause that has led to the war. The cause to support which we are committed may be just or unjust; the attitude of the attacked nation may have been irritating to the last degree, so long as it does not amount to a technical &quot; provocation&quot;; our people may be -bitterly opposed to the war; we may be in the middle of or on the verge of a
struggle in the Far East or in&apos; India; Dominions may be goaded to the point of &quot;neutrality,&quot; but, if we have once signed this Pact, we shall be dishonoured by failing to carry out our guarantee.5.1. : To place so great a strain on nations and Dominions and, above all, to risk an almost certain failure on the day is to endanger the whole structure of international and Imperial effort that has grown up since the war.52. Like all the French schemes, the new proposal puts too much emphasis  in this case all the emphasis on sanctions. Yet it may be argued with conviction that even the vague sanctions of the Covenant have hampered the League of Nations in its proper work of conciliation and arbitration. The moment the League comes in sight of sanctions all its efforts inevitably are directed to their avoidance, rather than to the merits of the dispute, for the ultimate reactions of sanctions are incalculable.53. There is also the objection that the air bombing guarantee, with all its planning and tuning up of defensive plans to concert pitch on an international basis, will tend to a recrudescence of the power of the military authorities throughout Europe, particularly if the scheme is extended all over the continent, as has been hinted at. And, before long, no one will feel one whit the safer, owing to the scheihe&apos;s inherent defects. In Fifty Years of Europe Mr. A. J. Spender gives a high place among the causes of the war to the gradual increase in power of the military authorities at the expense of the statesmen, and examples have been quoted in paragraphs 34 and 37 above of the sinister influence of the former during the critical days before the war.54. Finally, as already noted in paragraph 30, the tendency of the Pact must be to concentrate public opinion more and more on those morbid fears that to-day are the main cause of Europe&apos;s unrest, for (even in our own case) its supposed merits are based on fear.55. It has been shown that the proposed aerial Mutual Guarantee Pact, owing to French unreliability and other reasons, cannot be counted on to add to our own security; that it adds to our material as distinct from our legal com-commitment; that it points and sharpens the &quot;flagrant aggression&quot; sanction of Locarno, which is notoriously so unpopular as to be inapplicable in the only case where it is likely to arise; that the Pact is unworkable in its most important feature, namely, immediate action; in particular, it is impossible to draw up plans to bring immediate and effective aid to either of two potential belligerents, or to devise any means for testing, within a few hours and amid the chaotic conditions that precede a war, whether an air bombing attack was &apos;&apos; unprovoked&quot;; if logically applied the Pact may lead to plans being drawn up against the United Kingdom and the British Empire by France and Germany. In addition, the proposed Pact has been shown to be unsound in principle; to focus public opinion in Europe excessively on war; to increase the power of the military authorities on the continent at the expense of the statesmen, particularly when countries are on the verge of war; to focus public opinion throughout Europe on the dangers of sudden aggression; and to be based (even in our own case) on fear. It therefore increases the tendency towards war, besides ensuring that we must be drawn in automatically. Although the Dominions will not officially oppose the Pact, their public opinion will dislike it, to an extent that will vary in each Dominion; the ties of Empire and the prospects of obtaining support from overseas if ever we are drawn into a future struggle will in the end be weakened. This is an ..aspect which, perhaps, on a long view, is as serious as any.56. These considerations, nearly all of which are based on published facts, are bound to become apparent as time goes on. The deterrent effect of the Pact will fade away, as is happening to-day in the case of the Locarno sanctions. And public opinion will discover that this much-advertised proposal only adds one more to the two hundred post-war Treaties, agreements, &amp;c, that have failed :So lamentably to bring a sense of security to Europe.(Sighed) M.

this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1935.SECRET. Copy No.1166-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE PROPOSED AERIAL CONVENTION.Comments by the Foreign Office on the Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (1161-B) and on the Memorandtom by the Secretary to the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence (1162-B).THE Chiefs of Staff and Sir M. Hankey have circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence two papers containing their respective views on the proposed Aerial Convention. It is desired, first, to make certain observations of a general nature on those papers.2. This question must be considered on the basis of the existence of the Treaty of Locarno. Some of the most important arguments in Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s paper (and the same is true to some extent of the Chiefs of Staff report) are just as applicable to Locarno as they are to the proposed Air Conven-tion. But Locarno exists, and at intervals we repeat our intention of complying with our obligations under it; and if the hypothesis with which the proposed Convention would deal (a sudden air attack by one Party to Locarno upon another in circumstances involving a violation of the first Party&apos;s Locarno undertakings) were to occur, we should be bound, under our existing Locarno commitments, to come to the assistance of the victim, unless we elect to fail to honour our under -takings, with all the consequences which would ensue. It is suggested therefore that the main questions which have to be considered are two : (1) Would the conclusion of the proposed Convention make it more or less likely that we should be called upon to honour our Locarno commitments; (2) would the proposed Convention involve any increase in those commitments ?3. As to (1), the circumstance which is most likely to result in our being called upon to honour our Locarno guarantee is uncertainty as to whether we should, in fact, do so; here the precedent of 1914 is surely pertinent. It follows that action (such as the conclusion of the proposed Convention) which would indicate to a potential Locarno-breaker that he will have to reckon with us is likely, provided we are adequately armed, to operate as a powerful deterrent. If it is definitely known that in one case at least we should throw our weight into the scales at once, the chance of this case occurring is lessened. To establish publicly that an aggressor by air would have to meet the air forces of a combina-tion of other Powers concerned must surely reduce the risk of an aggression taking place. If this is sound, always provided we are adequately armed, the proposed Convention should further diminish the possibility of our having to act under the existing Locarno commitments, and if so, it should be welcomed by those who dislike those commitments.4. As to (2), it is argued in paragraphs 6 to 9 in the Chiefs of Staff report,, and also in Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s paper, that the proposed convention would involve a definite extension of Locarno. The true view, however, will, it is. suggested, be found in paragraph 10 of the Chiefs of Staff Report, where it is; stated that &quot;in actual practice aggression that brings the air forces into operation under the proposed pact will inevitably bring the provisions of the Locarno Treaty into operation.&quot; A serious and unprovoked air attack by Germany upon France would certainly constitute a &quot;flagrant violation&quot; of Article 2 of Locarno and an &quot;unprovoked act of aggression&quot; within the 7799   [11209] &quot; b
meaning of Article 4 (3), which would bring,our undertaking &quot; immediately to come to the help &quot;of France into operation. The only possible addition which the,proposed Convention would make to Locarno on this point is that, in the - circumstances postulated, we should be bound to hold that &quot; immediate action &quot; was iiecessary, and there could hardly be any doubt about that.5, The Chiefs of Staff argue in paragraph 7 of the Chiefs of Staff report that the Convention would differ from the Treaty of Locarno in that it would not place &quot; the responsibility for the final decision to enter the war on each country concerned.&quot; In the view of the Foreign Office, this is not a sound argument. , In every case of undertakings for mutual guarantees somebody has got to decide whether the casus fcederis has arisen, and unless the&quot; point is referred to, some external authority, the decision must be taken by the country whose guarantee, is invoked. In order that our guarantee should come into operation, there must be an act of aggression which is unprovoked. The phrase &quot; unprovoked aggression &quot; is in the Locarno Treaty, and so is the phrase &quot; undertakes immediately to come to the help of the party against whom such a violation or breach has been directed,&quot; but the question whether &quot;unprovoked aggression &quot; has taken place remains as before a question for us to decide for ourselves. If we were to imagine a faked dropping of a bomb, we should not be automatically drawn in, but should declare that we were not satisfied that &quot;aggression &quot; had taken place. And in the same way, it would remain for us to decide whether the attack is &quot; unprovoked.&quot; The novelty in the new pact is not that we are the victims of blind chance, but that if we are satisfied that there is an unprovoked aggression by air we should announce that we will act at once by air, A genuine case of unprovoked aggression by air upon a French town must surely bring into immediate operation our Locarno obligations already, and every competent jurist holds that the reference to &quot; forces &quot; in the Treaty of Locarno necessarily covers air forces.6. It is a mistake to describe the suggested air pact for cases already covered by the Locarno Treaty as &quot;an almost identical proposal&apos;&apos; with that considered by the Cabinet last May. There is surely all the difference in the world between agreeing that the British air force shall be used if, for example, Poland attacks Russia or Bulgaria attacks Greece, and an agreement which, whatever; its merits or demerits, does not extend our existing obligations to any class of base not covered by Locarno. It was precisely because the scope of the :May proposal would have involved extensive new commitments which would not be &quot;acceptable to public opinion in this country&quot; that the proposal of May was not pursued. It is not, therefore, necessary to discuss at greater length the objection to which Sir Maurice Hankey gives first place in his paper.7. We may now consider in detail the disadvantages of the Convention as stated by Sir M. Hankey and the Chiefs of Staff. For the sake of convenience the point of view of Sir M. Hankey and the Chiefs of Staff on the one hand, and of the Foreign Office on the other, are set out below in parallel columns : Sir M. Hankey and Chiefs of Staff.(1) Britain will be committed to take air action and will be plunged in war -with:..all.her forces-without the safe-[ guard contained in paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Locarno Treaty, which provides that a guarantor Power will ,come to the aid of a guaranteed Power only,when it is satisfied that immediate action is necessary, as. the result of an unprovoked act of aggression. The bombing attack will be- delivered and it - will he impossible; to determine if the ,-attack ,was unprovoked. (Para-graph., 181 of Chiefs, of Staff report and Sections VIII and - IX of Sir, Maurice Hankoy&apos;s memorandum.)        .:,Foreign Office.(1) The test of the operation of the guarantee under the Convention, as under the Locarno treaty, will be not an alleged isolated bomb, but events which satisfy this country that &apos;&apos; unpro-provoked aggression by air &quot; had actually taken place. If Brest or Nancy or Chatham or Harwich were destroyed or seriously damaged, the seriousness of the aggression would be a matter of common knowledge. (See also para-graphs 4 and 5 above.)
(4) The Convention involves military preparedness, which Locarno did not involve. (Paragraph 8 of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s memorandum.)(5) Locarno did not produce the peace results expected, and therefore should not be supplemented (para-graphs 9-11 of Sir M. Hankey&apos;s memorandum).11209](2) This point is really a question of drafting. It was dealt with in&apos; the Locarno Treaty and it can be dealt with again. The position will in fact be precisely the same as it already is under Locarno.(3) This may be the case; but the fact remains that, as in 1914, we could not allow France to be overwhelmed so long as there was any danger that we should ultimately ourselves be left to face Germany single-handed.    &apos;(4) It is the European situation and not any Convention of any kind which involves increased military prepared-ness, as matters now stand. Moreover, Locarno was never really open to any such interpretation. That interpreta-tion may have been put upon it for reasons of home convenience, and owing to the circumstances of the time, which were not such as to lead to the supposition that it might be necessary to implement it in any immediate future. With the rearmament of Germany one of the most important factors which has weakened Locarno abroad has been our known inability to live up to it. Our military prepared-ness, whether under Locarno or, the Air Convention, must be in proportion to the growing strength of Germany, which, at the moment, is the only real danger to us in Europe. The reason that we allowed our armaments to fall between 1925 and 1933 was not, as Sir M.Hankey states, because &quot;Locarno was a peace convention rather than a war convention,&quot; but because there was no potential aggression (cf. replace-ment of ten-year rule), and because it was found politically convenient to spend the money otherwise;(5) Locarno did not produce the results expected because of the growing dissatisfaction of Germany with the treaty settlement and the consequently increasing conviction that she intended to change it, if necessary, unilaterally or even by force of arms. The attitude of Germany in its turn produced the, French attitude to disarmament. It is arguable that the German determina-tion to flout the Treaty of Versailles was, in part, encouraged by our own notoriously inadequate armaments and the apparent uncertainty of our&apos; own policy. No proper estimate of these psychological factors can be reached save; by combining&quot;&apos; our Own point of view with seeing ourselves as others see us. Even- if -Locarno has::inot fulfilled expectations, this is no reasonb 2(2) Britain may be involved in war as a result of the commitments in other parts of Europe of other signatories to the : Convention. (Paragraph 19 of Chiefs of Staff report.)(3) Britain is less likely than France to have to face single-handed air attack by Germany. (Paragraph 19 of Chiefs of Staff report.)
&apos; for abandoning this further attempt togive effect to the collective peace system ih Europe which we always advocate as being the only alternative to a return to &apos; the pre-war system of balance of powerand competition in armaments. (6) Since the demilitarisation of the (6) The proposed air Convention does .1th in el and, guaranteed by Locarno, is riot apply to the demilitarised zone, about to be violated with impunity, we Indeed One of its merits may be that it ought not to enter on a new and much emphasises how much more serious we more onerous commitment of the same consider an attack on France or kind, which points and sharpens all Belgium than a disregard of the Locarno those aspects of Locarno that are most provisions about the demilitarised zone. Unpopular. (Paragraphs 12 to 14 of Far from pointing and sharpening Sir M. II an key&apos;s memorandum;) those aspects of Locarno which may bethought to be unpopular (by which is presumably meant the guaranteeing of France and Belgium), the proposed air convention, for the first time, makes a definite contribution towards guarantee-ing British security as distinct from French and Belgian security.    It is difficulty to suppose that this will be unpopular in this country. (7) It is doubtful if any democratic      (7) Leaving aside the criticism upon country can be counted on for long to   democracy, paragraph 16 of this sec-honour such an engagement as the Air   tion of Sir M. Hankey&apos;s paper points Convention : this view is supported by   out that nations will not go to war, historical reference.    (Section IV of   under modern conditions, except for Sir M. Hankey&apos;s memorandum.) some   overpowering  motive   such   as security or national ambition, in other words, for some vital interest. But surely thinking opinion in France is well aware that the integrity of Britain is for France a vital interest; and no French Government could ignore that fact. Whilst commenting on French unreliability, giving a number of instances of it and observing that &quot; a British guarantee is probably worth more than a French or Italian,&quot; though France is also a democratic country and Italy is the reverse, is it consistent to state that &quot; British public opinion could riot be induced to allow the Government to1 give effect to the flag-rant aggression clause of the Locarno Treaty &quot;?Are the chief historical instances quoted in this section altogether rele-vant to the circumstances now in question ? These cases could be argued at length, but would occupy overmuch space. In any case they could and would be countered by similar accusations-tions against us.(8) The signatories to the Conven-      (8) Is not this argument something tion, owing to their commitments or   of a truism?    But despite Sir M. difficulties elsewhere, might hot be in a   TIankey&apos;s  statement that  &quot;the pro-position to honour it. : (Section V Of   bability. is that Germany: will never : Sir M. HankeyV memorandum.)     &apos;        attack France, England or Belgium in normal times,&quot; it was precisely such times which she chose for the attack of 1914 ?
(11) The Convention will be unpopu-lar in the Dominions, who will be apt to believe it a new commitment. (Section XI of Sir M. Hankey&apos;s memo-randum.)It is hoped that the above paragraphs will show that approval of the scheme is not due, as Sir M. Hankey supposes, to &quot; shock tactics,&quot; but that it has been seriously considered and can be justified on merits.8. In conclusion, the Foreign Office view of the advantages of the Conven-tion may be stated.   They seem to be as follows : (i) The clear indication to Germany of a vital British interest which whether the commitment represented be written or unwritten is constituted by the maintenance of the integrity of Belgium and France.(ii) The equally clear indication which, unlike the Locarno Treaty, theConvention contains that the integrity of Britain is a vital interest to France.(iii) The deterrent which it should in these circumstances provide against aggression by Germany, on the assumption that adequate armaments are maintained by France and ourselves.(iv) The fact that the Convention would constitute the first constructiveand explicit effort to deal with the misuse of a newT and hitherto unknown weapon of war, i.e., sudden and overwhelming and whole-sale aerial bombardment, (v) The stabilising influence which the facts mentioned in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above may be expected to exercise throughout Europe.9: There remain two questions, that of the simultaneity of the conclusion of the Air Convention and of the general settlement (Sir M. Hankey&apos;s Memorandum, Section X, and Chiefs of Staff report, paragraph 20); and. that of the possibility of a Defensive&apos;Alliance (Chiefs of Staff report, paragraphs 21 and 22).(9) The cause of the dispute which would render the Convention operative might not be such as to appeal to the co-signatories, whose help would there-fore not be forthcoming. Sir M. Hankey quotes in particular a colonial dispute. (Section VI of Sir M. Hankey&apos;s memorandum.)(10) The mutual nature of the guarantees provided by the Convention is such as to render it impossible of operation, because we cannot make plans with both France and Germany. (Section VII of Sir M. Han key&apos;s memo-randum.)(9) France is also an inheritor of German colonies. Moreover a colonial dispute in which we were concerned would, if it led to w ar, inevitably extend in its consequences to the European theatre where interests vital for France would at once be engaged.(10) The answer is that such a question must be considered in a spirit of realism, and the reality is that the circumstances in which we should have to join Germany against France and Belgium are inconceivable.As regards Sir M. Hankey&apos;s sugges-tion (paragraph 29) that France and Germany will make plans against the United Kingdom, it does not appear probable that the French will study and elaborate the means of knocking out their one support.(11) The Convention is not a new commitment. The integrity of Belgium and France is for us a vital interest, which at need we have long defended by force of arms. It is that interest which is the commitment, not the paper or treaty by which it is recognized. The Dominions recognize, as in the case of Locarno, that we are entitled, indeed obliged, to protect ourselves. Were this not the case, the outlook for the Empire would be black indeed.
On the question of simultaneity, the Foreign Office is in agreement with Sir M. Hankey and the Chiefs of Staff.-10. The Foreign Office note the view of the Chiefs of Staff that from a military point of view using military in its widest sense a defensive alliance with France (and Belgium) would give us the added security which the Convention is designed to produce without some of its apparent disadvantages. Is it clear that from other points of view the Defensive Alliance would not be open to the objections urged against the Convention ? In any case, it is doubtful if British public opinion is yet ripe for such a proposal.J. S.Foreign Office, February 21, 1935.

It is not clear whether unrestricted bombing of civilian and non-military targets is contemplated, or whether air action would be governed by what might be called the &apos;&apos; rules of war &quot; as we understood them in 1914. The inference is, however, that bombing would be unrestricted both by the aggressor and by those called on to retaliate. We are fully aware that once the issue were joined, if a nation felt the need, such &quot;rules of war &quot; as existed might become &quot; scraps of paper &quot; as happened in the last war with regard to the use of gas. At the same time, as we found to our advantage in the Great War as regards the torpedoing of merchant ships, the moral value of humanitarian rules is great. Even an unscrupulous nation will hesitate to break them because of the alienation of neutral opinion which would ensue, and is at any fate unlikely to break them at the outset. If a belligerent decides to disregard the &quot; rules of war &quot; it may well prove that any military advantages which there may be in doing so are outweighed by the moral loss which follows from alienating world opinion. In any case, to assume and thus tacitly accept beforehand that uncivilised methods of conducting war are to be expected as a matter of course would, by the influence of suggestion, be the most certain way to ensure that they would in fact be used. We wish to make it clear that we do not raise this question on ethical or humanitarian grounds, as opinions on the merits of unrestricted bombing may vary. We raise it from the standpoint of its effect on our national security, since we cannot emphasise too strongly that in the actual event it would be this country and our own people that would suffer most if unrestricted bombing were to be accepted by the nations of Europe as a legitimate means of warfare!I.Joint Note.(Signed)ERNLE CHATFIELD.A. A. MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD.February 6, 1935.[11191]
Remarks by the Foreign Office.It is suggested that the important question raised in the note by the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff would not&apos;be decided, either way by the:suggested air-agreement. The proposal is that the signatories should agree to. come to the, assistance of any one of them who may be the object of an unprovoked act of aggression from the air, and provided that these conditions were fulfilled, it would make no difference from the point of view of the coming into operation of the guarantee whether the unprovoked attack was conducted in accordance with what may be considered to be the rules of war governing air operations, or not. The question whether the air action to be taken against the aggressor should be conducted in accordance with those rules or not would be one for the Governments concerned to decide; but it seems inconceivable that the proposed agreement could impose upon them any obligation to disregard those rules if they did not wish to do so.&quot;Without attempting to go into the question of what can be said at the present time to be the rules of war governing aerial action, it would seem safe to assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to be the first to dis-regard them, and that they would be prepared to conduct their aerial operations in accordance with those rules so long as the enemy did the same. The question is, therefore, one of reprisals in the event of a disregard of the rules in question by the enemy. This question is inherent in every rule prohibiting or regulating the employment of particular methods of warfare. In the case of the proposed air agreement it would seem that the taking of reprisals in kind would neither be expressly provided for nor expressly ruled out. The question must depend upon circumstances. It is hardly for the Foreign Office to attempt to define those circumstances, but the following would seem to be the considerations which would require to be taken into account:- (a) The nature and extent of the illegal action;(b) The possibility of its repetition and extension, e.g., whether the combinedair forces assembled in defence of the attacked Power possess so complete a mastery of the air as to render the original aggressor&apos;s air force immobile;(c) The factor of public opinion, which cannot be estimated in advance., Foreign Office, February 15, 1935.III.Note by the Secretary of State for Air covering Comments by the Chief of theAir Staff.. I HAVE asked the Chief of the Air Staff for his views, which he has given to me in the attached memorandum with which I find myself in complete agreement.The main objection to the proposal made by C.N.S. and C.I.G.S., as I under-stand it, is dealt with in the last paragraph of the note by the Chief of the Air Staff that is to say, the delay and complications which.are likely to arise in the forthcoming negotiations if an attempt be made simultaneously to arrive at an agreement as to the rules of air warfare.-:(Initialled) L..  A%7^ Ministry, February 15, 1935.     n
Enclosure to III.Comments by the Chief of the Air Staff.1. In discussing the point raised by my colleagues, I would wish to make it -clear-at the outset that I have no intention to re-state, and still less to alter, opinions already expressed with regard to the major issue of whether ah Air Pact is or is not desirable.2.   The C.N.S. and C.I.G.S. (as I understand their Memorandum)-        ;(a) assume that unrestricted bombing of civilian and non-military targetswould be a probable corollary to any air operations undertaken under the Air Pact;(b) consider that &quot;this country and our own people would suffer most ifunrestricted bombing were to be accepted&quot;; - .(r) suggest, apparently, that a code of rules for the regulation of air warfare should be agreed upon as a condition to any Air Pact.3.   To take these points in their order : (a) I cannot trace in the papers connected with the French proposal any -statement which justifies this assumption. Moreover, it is not clear why an immediate disregard of &apos;&apos; what might be called the rules of war as we understood them in 1914 &quot; should follow in the case of air operations undertaken under an Air Pact any more than that such &quot; rules &quot; as are normally observed in regard to land and sea operations would be jettisoned if operations had to be undertaken under the Locarno Treaty by land or sea forces.I agree, however, with my colleagues that even an unscrupulous aggressor who has previously accepted a code of rules may refrain from &quot; frightfulness &quot; in the belief that it would be to his own advantage to do so, and consequently that the existence of such a code might strengthen the motives for abstaining from unrestricted bombing. But it is impossible to forecast what would happen in this respect if the Air Pact failed in its primary object of preventing war, and I observe that the C.N.S. and C.I.G.S. themselves state &quot; that once the issue was joined, if a nation felt the need, such rules of war as existed might become scraps -of paper.&quot; The hypothesis of warlike operations under the pact assumes an aggressor state, and there must clearly be a risk that a state which is prepared to break its engagements and to embark on a war of aggression at all may consider that sudden and violent disregard of the restrictions imposed by the &quot; rules of war &quot; would afford its best chance of delivering a knockout blow.4. My colleagues emphasise the alienation of world opinion that should follow the breaking of &quot; rules of war &quot; and suggest that the moral loss thereby sustained might well outweigh any military advantages to be gained. I suggest that in the absence of any laws of air warfare precisely the same considerations would weigh to the same extent with any belligerent contemplating resort to unrestricted air bombardment. I am, therefore, of the opinion that unrestricted air bombardment is no more and no less likely under the proposed Air Pact than it would be in the absence of such a Pact.5. As to (&amp;), I agree that this country and our own people might suffer the most severely from unrestricted bombing, but on the hypothesis again that the Pact has failed to prevent war, we could not rely upon an enemy&apos;s abstaining from the exploitation of our vulnerability to air attack a vulnerability which is fully appreciated by other Powers. Conceiitrated attacks from the air upon military establishments and depots, centres of transportation or of munition production would be, from our point of view and from their effects upon non-combatants and upon the morale of the civil population, almost equivalent to unrestricted bombing. I do not know whether the C.N.S. and C.I.G.S. would regard these as legitimate objectives, but I have no doubt that to an enemy Power (the forces of war once released) such attacks might appear as a necessary and justifiable counter to, for example, the operation of a British Naval Blockade
against their.own food supplies. While, therefore, I do not wish to oppose the search for a code of rules as providing some deterrent against the resort to-indiscriminate bombing, there are definite risks (i) that in drawing up a code we should be driven into accepting paperrestrictions which would not stand the test of war; and (ii) that the embodiment of those restrictions in the code would induce a false sense of security and lead to the neglect of adequate measures of precaution.6. In this connection I would refer to an article which was written by a distinguished soldier, General Sir George MacDonogh, a former Adjutant-General, in which he reviewed the proAdsions of the Draft Code for the Regulation of Air Warfare which was drawn up at The Hague twelve years ago, but which has never been ratified by any of the Powers concerned.&quot; It is the disease itself, and not one of its symptoms, which should be attacked. It would seem far wiser and no more difficult to direct the full force of world opinion to the outlawry of war rather than against one of its features. So long as war is permissible, it will be the bounden duty of each belligerent to make use of every weapon that may directly lead to victory. War is inhuman in its essence, and very little can be done to humanise it. In fact it is possible that the demands that are being made with this object in view may in the end defeat their own purpose by creating a false impression as to the nature of war and distracting public opinion from its inherent barbarity. The value of aerial bombardment as a weapon of offence is so great that it seems impossible to lay down any effective rules for the protection of the civil population, outside the zone of artillery fire, which are likely to be observed, and it is submitted that the only effectual means of protecting non-combatants from the horrors of war is by abolishing war itself.&quot;( 7. Since the War, repeated attempts have been made to regulate air bombardment by international agreement. No acceptable solution has so far been found. While I would be the first to welcome any practicable agreed regulations, I doubt the possibility of early international agreement to that end. By the act of concluding Pacts and Treaties we are doing nothing to deprive ourselves of our prerogative to reserve the right of employing our weapons in accordance with our own views of strategy and propriety: similarly, I cannot myself understand why the conclusion of such agreements should, in any way, influence our possible enemies in their methods of conducting an air war; neither can I understand how the possibility that the civil population will be regarded as a legitimate target for unrestricted air bombardment will be increased or decreased by the suggested provisions of the Pact.8. : For these reasons I am forced to the conclusion that the adoption of the proposal at (c), namely, that an agreement as to the regulation of air warfare should be a condition of the proposed Pact, is likely indefinitely to postpone and greatly to complicate the. negotiation of the Pact itself. The essential objects of the Pact are, as I understand them, to prevent war breaking out and to call a halt to rearmament. If we are to reach an agreement on this latter point, there is no time to be lost; indeed, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, it is already too late. If this issue is to be complicated by discussions as to the methods of warfare to be employed by the limited air forces, I believe that no agreement as to their size will be reached in time, and that we should have to face an uncontrolled race in armaments.Air Ministry, February 15, 1935.o
