THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 17 (35).CABINET.UNITED KINGDOM-POLISH COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I ANNEX a memorandum setting out in some detail the facts relating to the negotiations for a trade agreement which we have been conducting with Poland during the past six months. As my colleagues will see, these negotiations have for various reasons proved both complicated and difficult; in particular, the settlement of shipping questions has proved especially troublesome.The agreement proposed is, I think, one which will provide the opportunity for useful expansion in our export trade; it is estimated that, under existing conditions, it should lead to an increase of  500,000 a year in the value of our exports to Poland (see paragraph 10 of the memorandum). Valuable safeguards have also been obtained for the trade of our Colonies with Poland. Moreover, the new Polish State occupies what may be described as one of the key positions in the economy of Europe, and it is, in my view, highly desirable on all grounds that we should strengthen and develop our commercial relations with Poland. It will be remembered that the coal industries of the two countries have recently reached an agreement, which should be of considerable benefit to our export trade in coal.As will be seen from paragraph 9 of the memorandum, no new concession of substance would be accorded to Poland by the proposed agreement we would merely undertake to maintain the advantages she at present enjoys in the United Kingdom market by virtue of most-favoured-nation treatment.Accordingly, I ask the authority of my colleagues to conclude an agreement on the lines indicated in the memorandum. The agreement will run to the end of 1936, which is the date already adopted for similar agreements recently negotiated with other countries.W. R.Board of Trade, January 24, 1935. ,United Kingdom-Poland Commercial Negotiations.1. The commercial relations between the United Kingdom and Poland are regulated at present by the Commercial Treaty of 1923, which provides, inter alia, for most-favoured-nation treatment for the goods, and national and most-favoured-nation treatment for the shipping, of the two countries. Preliminary discussions with the Polish Government with a view to the conclusion of a Trade Agreement to supplement the Treaty took place in 1933, a Trade Mission visited Poland in March 1934, and the negotiations proper began in June 1934. Since that date the Polish Delegation have been continuously in London, except for holiday periods, and over 100 meetings have been held. The negotiations have not [11057] b
only been protracted, but also complicated and difficult, for the following reasons (a) Poland is a new country which up to the present has relied rather on ad hoc trade bargains, and the present agreement is apparently regarded by the Poles as a key agreement which will set the general standard for agreements with other countries.(&amp;) Poland has followed an ultra-nationalist policy. Compliance with our requests involves considerable modification in that policy in several directions, and the Polish Delegation have not had an easy task in persuading the Polish Ministers to agree to the desired changes, e.g., in regard to shipping and motor questions.(c) Poland,  though mainly  an agricultural country,  is well developedindustrially. A high level of protection is maintained, and the Tariff is an extremely complicated one. Also, Poland protects her exchange by means of a network of import prohibitions which affect about 75 per cent, of the imports from the United Kingdom. It has been necessary to discuss separate quotas for nearly 200 classes of our goods.(d) The Polish Government have, for political and other reasons, been very anxious to secure precise guarantees as to the future of their trade with this country in agricultural products, especially bacon which accounts for about one-third of the value of Poland&apos;s total trade with the United Kingdom. Uncertainty as to the amount of Polish bacon which would be admitted in 1935 made progress difficult in the earlier stages of the negotiations, and our inability to give any indication as to the amount which will be admitted after 1935 has made it necessary to make special provision in the proposed agreement for reconsideration at the end of 1935 of the quotas for our goods in Poland.-&apos;!&apos;Balance of trade between United Kingdom and Poland.2. The visible balance of trade in recent years has been consistently in favour of Poland. In 1933, our imports from Poland amounted to  6-6 million, while our exports were  2 - 7 million and re-exports  1 -1 million, the balance against us being  2-8. In 1934, both imports and exports showed a slight increase, as also did the unfavourable balance.The United Kingdom is Poland&apos;s best customer and took 19 per cent, (by value) of her exports in 1933, Germany following closely with 17^ per cent. As regards imports into Poland, the United Kingdom took third place in 1933 with 10 per cent, of the total value, Germany having 17^ per cent, and the U.S.A. 13 per cent.Object of negotiations.3. Our principal aims in the negotiations have been (1) to obtain such facilities for our goods in- the Polish market as will enable us to obtain a substantial increase in our trade, and (2) to secure satisfaction for British shipping which is not enjoying full national treatment in Poland, and has an inadequate share of the trade between the two countries. At the same time, we have taken the opportunity of dealing with certain obstacles in the way of the trade of our Colonies with Poland.Concessions obtained for United Kingdom and Colonial Trade.4. Under the proposed Agreement we shall secure reductions of duty on the principal classes of goods we send to Poland, i.e., herrings, cotton and woollen goods, and machinery and electrical goods. These items account for about one-half of our trade, and in 1933 had a value of about  1,300,000.; &quot;We shall also obtain reductions or consolidations of duty on various miscellaneous goods, the trade in which in 1933 was worth about  400,000. In addition, the Polish duties on motor cars and commercial chassis, which are now prohibitive, will be reduced to levels which, in the opinion of the United Kingdom industry, will give this country a reasonable prospect of building up a satisfactory trade. Adequate quotas will also be fixed for all classes of our goods which are subject to import restrictions.
5. Purchase Arrangements between Polish and United Kingdom industrial associations (of which note will be taken in the Commercial Agreement) have been secured for the purpose of maintaining and increasing the share of trade enjoyed by the United Kingdom in the Polish market over a wide range of goods. The value of United Kingdom exports to Poland in 1933 of goods which will now be covered by Purchase Arrangements amounts to about  650,000. The arrange-ments lay emphasis on the necessity for continued co-operation between the United Kingdom and Polish industries, and include provisions for periodical assessment and discussions if increased trade does not result. It is anticipated that an influential independent central committee willbe appointed in Poland to assist the successful operation of the arrangements. An understanding has been reached on State Purchases, which, although not in written form, may be expected to result in an increased share being placed in the United Kingdom. Because of the nature of these arrangements and the uncertainty of the development of the Polish market, it is impossible to forecast with any accuracy what the outcome will be, but it is anticipated that, apart from the advantage of preventing existing trade being diverted to other countries, the arrangements should lead to an increase over 1933 exports of about  200,000. If State Purchases are made to any considerably increased amount, the advantages to the United Kingdom may reach an appreciable figure.6. As regards the Colonies, we shall remove grievances regarding the treatment in Poland of tanning extracts, palm oil.and Trinidad asphalt, and also secure satisfactory quotas for the principal classes of Colonial goods sent to Poland. At the same time we shall secure the exemption of Colonial trade from the Compensation trade regulations of Poland, under which the import of certain classes of Colonial goods may be made dependent on the compensatory export of certain classes of Polish goods, or the payment of special fees in lieu thereof.7. As regards shipping, we have met with great difficulties. Poland is determined to make every effort to build up a national mercantile marine, and is very jealous of anything that would seem to hinder her from advancing the interests of her shipping. We have only succeeded in getting any approach to our wishes by the threat that otherwise there can be no trade agreement; the discussions on shipping have not yet been concluded, but we hope to secure proposals which can be regarded as reasonably satisfactory, although not all that our shipping companies desire. The proposals should secure for British tramps and cargo liners an increased share of the tramp trade based on Polish ports and of the short sea liner trade between the two countries. They should also meet some of the difficulties of our passenger lines in the emigrant trades from Poland to North and South America.8. A more detailed description of the concessions to be obtained by the United Kingdom is given in Annex I to this Memorandum.Concessions granted to Poland.9. Poland obtains under the proposed agreement (a) concessions already granted to other countries under previous trade agreements, and (6) certain new concessions.As regards (a), Poland would be given (i) guarantees, on the usual lines, of equitable treatment in regard to the allocation of quotas for agricultural produce;(ii) consolidation of the present duty position on certain products ofimportance to Poland, e.g., bacon and hams, eggs, butter, grass seed and timber. The value of the Polish trade in these items in 1933 was for agricultural produce a little over  3,000,000 (of which bacon accounted for  2,500,000), and for other products about  1,750,000 (almost entirely timber);(iii) the usual undertaking that quotas will not be imposed on Polish goods(other than agricultural produce) for which the tariff position is being consolidated.As. regards (&amp;)&quot;, the new concessions which it is proposed to give Poland include (i) a guarantee that her proportion of our imports of foreign bacon will[11057] b 2
not be reduced; (ii) an undertaking, valid for 1935 only, that imports of butter from Poland will not be subjected to regulation if they do not exceed the volume of the imports in 1929; (iii) a guarantee that Poland will be allocated not less than 13-1 Per cent, of our imports of foreign eggs; (iv) consolidation of the present duty position as regards the classes of goods mentioned in Annex II to this memorandum - the&apos; value of the imports from Poland in 1933 of the goods mentioned in Annex II was for agricultural products about  65,000 and for other goods  500,000; (v) an undertaking that certain woollen rugs (kilims), Which .-are a Polish speciality, shall be charged with the duty applicable to machine-made carpets and not with that applicable to hand-made carpets. This is the only case in which a reduction of duty is being granted to Poland. The trade is quite small.Estimate of effect of A greement.10. The precise effect of an agreement of this character must obviously be largely a matter of speculation. We shall obtain concessions on duties, quotas, purchase arrangements and other matters which are designed to facilitate and foster our trade with Poland, but the effect of these concessions necessarily depends to a large extent on the development of Poland&apos;s purchasing power, the financial standing of Polish traders, the course of exchange, the competitive power of other countries, the efforts made by United Kingdom exporters to take advantage of the opportunities offered to them, and, last but not least, goodwill on the part of Poland in encouraging United Kingdom trade and in carrying out the spirit as well as the letter of the Trade Agreement. Reviewing the terms of the proposed Agreement as a whole it is estimated that, under existing conditions, it should lead to an increase of at least  500,000 a year in our exports to Poland (including the increase of  200,000 expected to result from purchase arrangements see paragraph 5 above), while for Poland it should mean the maintenance of her trade with us at about its present value.Board of Trade, January 1935.
Summary of the Principal Concessions to be obtained by the United Kingdom under Proposed Trade Agreement with Poland.(A) Tariff Concessions. ,   .Herrikgs. Herrings formerly accounted for 25 per cent, of our trade with Poland, but in 1933 only for some 13 per cent. ;The Polish duty on salt herrings generally has been 24 zloty per barrel, but seven years ago the Poles introduced a special rate of 8 zloty for large herrings, leaving the small herring, which is our main interest, at 24 zloty. Under the pro-posed agreement we shall secure a rate of 12 zloty for the small herring, and a provision that the duty on the small herring shall not in any case be more than 50 per cent, greater than the duty on the large herring. This will-mean that the ad valorem incidences of the duties on the two classes of herring will be approxi-mately the same. We shall also secure a reduction in the duty on fresh herrings from 2 zloty to 1 zloty per 100 kilog. As a temporary measure, pending the conclusion of a Trade Agreement, the Polish Government have already reduced the duty on small salted herrings to 16 zloty per barrel and on fresh herrings to 1 zloty per 100 kilog.Textiles. The discussions on the Polish textile duties have proved difficult, mainly because Poland, has cotton and woollen industries of her own which are in a bad way as a result of the loss of their natural market in Russia. Under the Agreement, however, we shall secure concessions which should help our textile industries, especially the cotton industry. The duties on cotton yarns will be reduced practically to the level suggested by Manchester. As regards cotton tissues, we have covered all the items of importance to Manchester, and shall enjoy duties thereon which are in most cases lower than the rates in force in Poland since the year 1928. In addition, special concessions will be given on wide prints, warp-printed goods and cambrics. On woollen yarns, the duties will be reduced by about 10 per cent., a measure of reduction which is acceptable to the United Kingdom industry.In respect of wool tissues, we have been less successful, though we shall obtain some modification in the duties on worsteds and the acceptance of one of the requests to which our industry attached importance, i.e., a tolerance of 5 per cent, by weight for silk admixture, which will mean that certain cloths will be relieved of a surtax amounting to 30 per cent, of the Customs duty.Motor Products. The sale of motor products to Poland is now practically impossible. Under the Agreement we shall secure substantial reductions in duties for motor cars up to about 16 h.p., for all commercial chassis, and for motorbuses and other special vehicles. Throughout the discussions we have kept in the closest touch with the United Kingdom industry and the rates of duties we shall secure, though they are not so low as the United Kingdom industry would have wished, will, in the opinion of the industry, give this country a reasonable prospect of building up a satisfactory trade with Poland in motor products.Miscellaneous Goods. Special reductions of duty will be given, on the basis of lists which have been agreed between the industries in the two countries, for chemicals and various classes of machinery of kinds not made in Poland. &apos; We shall also secure reductions or consolidations of duty on some 120 other classes of goods the trade in which in 1933 was worth about  400,000. Among these goods are glace kid, sewing machines, motor cycles, cycle parts, tyres, gas cookers and heaters and whisky.(B) Quotas for United Kingdom Goods.Kir, VndeF th? Agreement we shall fix the quotas for nearly 200 classes of United hi Em g00ds&apos;  The general basis of the quotas has been the volume of the trade 1 cpwI ^creased by 20 Per cent., but in most of the cases in which it seemed It nn \ u We CO- d fil1 a lar er (luota the Poles have agreed to fix a higher figure must be mentioned, however, that our inability to give the Poles any indicationANNEX I.
of the quantity of bacon they will be permitted to send to this country after 1935 has necessitated the inclusion of a clause which will entitle either party at the end of one year to raise the question of the revision of the quotas it has granted, and, if agreement is not reached, either party may denounce the whole agreement.(C)- Purchase A rrangements.The negotiations for purchase arrangements have shown the existence of a considerable amount of goodwill on the part of Polish industry. Stress has been laid throughout by Polish interests on the necessity for co-operation by United Kingdom interests to obtain satisfactory results, but machinery has been provided to foster this co-operation, and to maintain close touch with the results. The absence of suitable organisations has prevented &quot;binding undertakings&quot; for all the goods covered by purchase arrangements, but in some cases, where these under -takings have not been possible, the arrangements entered into rest upon the written statement of principal purchasers that they will carry out the purchase arrangements.Undertakings, or some other arrangement which is tantamount to an under-taking, have been secured in respect of supplies from the United Kingdom of scoured wool and wool tops, cotton yarns, machinery and tools for the Polish timber industry and jute wrappers. These undertakings on the basis of 1933 imports cover about two-thirds of the whole field of purchase arrangements. Lack of suitable organisations prevented a guarantee of purchase of any named quantity, but the maintenance and increase of the existing share of imports taken from the United Kingdom is assured for scoured wool and wool tops and for cotton yarns. The minimum percentage of imports of machinery, tools, &amp;c., to be bought by the -Polish timber industry is 50 per cent., representing a consider-able improvement on past purchases, and the State Forests Department is pledged to the same extent. The Polish Timber Union is appointing a special committee to push the sale of United Kingdom machinery and tools. As Poland has a well established jute industry and is actually a considerable exporter, the arrange-ment for jute wrappers for bacon, exported to the United Kingdom could only be secured to cover 50 per cent, of the requirements of Poland, but is highly satis-factory in the circumstances.For wool waste and laps, the Polish Association is recommending its members to maintain the United Kingdom share of imports and to endeavour to increase it, while for textile machinery and parts, leather, chemicals and agricultural and dairy machinery, the Polish Associations have promised to use their influence with their members to increase purchases from the United Kingdom. In the case of the Polish Agricultural and Chemical Associations special effort in co-operation is promised.The Polish Delegation gave an oral assurance of intention to divert State and Municipal purchases to the United Kingdom if Polish supplies were not available, but were not prepared to give a written undertaking. They are, how-ever, making arrangements to facilitate the practical operation of the promise.(D) Shipping.(i) Tramp Tonnage. The Polish Government will undertake to exert their influence to secure that British tramp shipping, whenever competitive as to price and conditions, shall be made use of to the fullest possible extent. To this end they will further undertake to inform us of prospective requirements and of the result of tenders, and the reasons why, if this should prove to be the case, the tenders made by the British tramp owners have not been accepted.(ii) Short sea liner trade. The Polish Government will undertake to collaborate with us with a view to securing a more equitable division of this trade (now largely in the hands of a Polish company) between the British and Polish ships, and arrangements have been made which will result in some immediate increase of our share of the trade, and which will secure that if there be any opportunity for the employment of additional tonnage in the trade, British lines shall, until such time as their share of the carrying trade is approximately equal to that of the Polish Line, have the first option of providing the necessary tonnage.
(iii) Emigration Trades. The main grievance of the British steamship lines has been the Polish Emigration Decree of 1930, which requires them to carry their Polish emigrants for North America by direct ocean-going steamer from Gdynia. It is economically impracticable for any of the British Lines to run a direct ocean service from Gdynia. The Polish Government have undertaken to abrogate this Decree as early as possible. In the case of the trade to the United States, however, it is not likely to be abrogated before the end of 1935 because of commitments already entered into by the Polish Government.To secure the abrogation of the Decree, we are asked to agree in principle to the Polish contention that emigrants should leave Poland by steamer from the port of Gdynia, i.e., by a short sea steamer, with transhipment at a United Kingdom or Continental port. If we can secure for the British Lines the right to carry their emigrants to a convenient port by the means most acceptable to themselves, including, of course, routing by rail from Poland should such facilities be enjoyed by the companies of any other country, agreement should be possible on this subject. But we shall not be able to secure this right so far as regards Italy, who is entitled to convey Polish emigrants overland to Trieste for embarkation. The position of Italy is, however, geographically entirely different from that of the United Kingdom.ANNEX II.List of Items the duties on which are not noio consolidated, but are proposed to be consolidated in the Trade Agreement with Poland.1. Agricultural. Buckwheat, white clover seed, pit ponies, live geese not exceeding 6 kilog. each, dead guinea fowl, certain preserved meats, rye and rye flour, and sugar beet seed (for two years only).2. Other. Certain rubber footwear, osiers, bentwood chairs, staves, and certain timber items, including hewn and square sawn oak.o
