This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government. %Z2Printed for the Cabinet January,- 1935 ^secret copy No.&amp;&apos;CP. 21 (35)THE CABINETTHE INFANTRY GARRISON AT SINGAPOREMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI desire to invite the decision of my colleagues on a question of policy which has arisen with regard to the Defence of Singapore. The question is whether the second infantry battalion, which has to be provided to complete the Garrison, shall be despatched at the end of the financial year 1935 or shall wait until the end of 1936.As the Cabinet are aware, the completion of the Fortress of Singapore is proceeding under a programme prepared by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and embodied in C.I.D. paper No. 1103-B, which was adopted with some modifications by the Cabinet at their meeting on 12th April, 1933 (Cabinet 27 (33), Conclusion 5). Under that programme  831,000 was spent up to March, 1934. It is estimated that another  821,000 will be spent in the present financial year, and a sum of  858,000 is provided in the Draft Estimates for 1935-36. It is anticipated that by the end of 1935-36 the Singapore defences will be &apos; substantially completed, with the exception of (a) The 15-inch guns.(b) A portion of the anti-aircraft defences.(c) The provision of the second British infantry battalion.Under the programme as drafted in OLD. paper No. 1103-B, this battalion would not be sent out until the trooping season of 1936-37, i.e., in two years time. 1 have now received from the General Officer Commanding, Malaya, a detailed appreciation of the situation in Singapore and the necessary provision for its defence ; and in this appreciation he points out that the second battalion is essential for the proper defence of the Fortress, and he recommends that it shall be despatched at the earliest possible moment, that is during the trooping season 1935-36, and he states deliberately that in his view we are running an unjustifiable risk by the delay.The Cabinet will appreciate that each year the Fortress becomes a more tempting prize for any potential enemy, and they will remember that the Cabinet has already been advised by the Chiefs of Staff that the year 1936 is likely to be a critical one in the Far East as between Japan and ourselves, since Japan will almost have completed the modernization of her capital ships and the main expansion of her Air Force, including her Fleet Air Arm, whereas in these two respects the British Fleet will be unready and the Garrison of Singapore will be incomplete.If the battalion is to be sent during the 1935-36 trooping season, it will be necessary to make provision in the Estimates for the erection of the barracks which, at a first estimate, will involve a sum of between  50,000 and  60,000. The Chancellor of the Exchequer raises no objection on financial grounds to the provision of this sum, but he agrees with me in thinking that the political factor raises a question of policy which ought to be brought to the notice of the Cabinet and for which the Cabinet ought to take responsibility. On the other side it may be argued that the despatch of the infantry battalion would be likely to excite hostility in Japan ; but it must be remembered that the intended despatch of this battalion must be well known to the Japanese, since the preliminary arrangements for
land, &amp;c, for the barrack construction have already been made, and that there has already been an increase in the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineer establishments of some 550 men, and neither this increase nor the development of the defences has produced any serious repercussions in the Far East.The view which is urged by the General Officer Commanding, Malaya, is shared by his predecessor and is accepted by the General Staff as correct. In these circumstances I ask the Cabinet to decide whether (1) The second battalion shall be despatched to Singapore in the trooping season 1935-36 ; .       .      * .i , .or(2) Its despatch shall not take place until 1936-37.H.The War Office,26th January, 1935.(b35/8)   70   1/35   w.o.p.   8368
