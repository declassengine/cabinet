Copy No.CP. 35 (35).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH JAPAN.Note on Financial and Economic Position of China by the Chancellor of theExchequer.MY colleagues will remember that at the meeting of  he Cabinet on the 23rd January it was decided to reserve further consideration of our political and economic relations with Japan until I had had an opportunity of circulating a note on the silver position in China.2. Examination shows that it is not possible to divorce this question from the larger issues involved in China&apos;s economic position.I accordingly asked the Treasury to prepare a general appreciation of this, and attach a memorandum by Sir Warren Fisher.3. The main points which emerge, and to which I would invite my colleagues&apos; attention, seem to be : (a) The originating cause of China&apos;s economic troubles is the long-continued state of civil disorder, amounting almost to anarchy, and complicated by Communism.(6) The silver policy of the United States of America may bring this to a head, unless it is modified.(c) The  possibility  of  a  complete  economic  collapse  in   China,   withfar-reaching consequences, cannot be ignored.(d) Unilateral action by any one country of the type and on the scalerequisite to avert this is impracticable, alike because of the Consortium Agreement of 1920, and because .some form of control of China&apos;s budgetary and economic arrangements would be a prerequisite condition of any large-scale assistance, and this must obviously be international in character.(e) In any event, the participation of the Chinese authorities themselves inany joint endeavour is essential.4. The dangers of the Chinese situation are evidently very present to the Japanese Government; for, on the 29th January, the British Ambassador at Tokyo telegraphed that the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs &apos;&apos; expresses anxiety about the danger of a financial crisis in Shanghai. If this developed, he foresaw the danger of a spread of Communism, civil war and chaos. He understood that the Chinese were very bitter against the Americans on account of their silver policy, and was anxious to know the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;5. This move by the Japanese Government affords, I think, a very convenient opening, and I would suggest that we should telegraph to our Ambassador at Tokyo instructing him to take a suitable and early opportunity of telling the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty&apos;s Government have been following with close attention the development of the financial situation in China. He could inform the Vice-Minister in confidence of the proposal made [11147] b
to us by Soong, and of the reasons why we felt that the proposal was unlikely to afford any real or lasting remedy. These reasons were explained to the Ambassador in the Foreign Office (repeat) telegram No. 9* of the 19th January. He could then state that His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to keep in the closest touch with Japan and the other Governments chiefly concerned with regard to the present difficulties of China, and wind up by suggesting that the Japanese Ambassador in London should be authorised to discuss the position with His Majesty&apos;s Government. He would add that a similar suggestion is being made simultaneously to the United States and French Governments.6. Simultaneously, I would suggest the issue of instructions to our Ambassadors at Washington and Paris. They have already received copies of the telegram of the 19th January referred to in the preceding paragraph; and in the light of the subsequent telegram from Sir R. Clive and of the proposed reply, they could be asked to take an early opportunity of informing confidentially the Governments to which they are respectively accredited of the proposal recently made by Dr. Soong as detailed in the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee sent to their Financial Advisers, and of the explanations given of our views in regard to this proposal as stated in the telegram of the 19th January. They would then proceed to suggest to the United States and French Governments that there should be joint consideration of the problem in London between the four Powers as outlined in the proposed telegram to Tokyo. And in the case of the United States, Sir R. Lindsay might try to ascertain whether there is any chance of the United States altering their silver policy in order to avert danger to China; he could, of course, make it quite clear that the United States silver policy is the immediate crux of the position.7. My colleagues will, I imagine, agree with me that the adoption of a purely negative policy of watching the economic disintegration of China might well have the gravest results, not merely in the economic but also in the political sphere. It seems to me, therefore, that a joint examination by the interested Powers, to be instituted at an early date, is obviously a most desirable first step. Should this lead to agreement about the main lines of the policy to be pursued, it might then be possible that banking houses here and elsewhere would be prepared to advance a limited amount for the service of the Chinese Government so as to cover the interval required for the working out of the main proposals.Whatever the practical outcome may be, the difficulties of effecting the economic rehabilitation of China are most formidable from every point of view; I need not repeat them as they are mentioned in the Treasury memorandum. But this is no reason, in my opinion, for refusing to make an effort to see whether some solution might not be possible.N. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, February 8, 1935.Memorandum by Sir Warren Fisher.The situation in China is admittedly one of chaos. As a result of seventeen years of Civil War, the control of the so-called Central Government is actual over some three provinces and nominal or non-existent over the remainder.On the face of it, this might be regarded as an internal matter, although from the humanitarian point of view the sufferings of the people in the interior cannot he glossed over.The question, however, arises as to whether the continuance of the existing drift in China will not result in its becoming an external question affecting the peace of the Pacific.   There are two grounds for this suggestion.The first is the growth of so-called communism in China, due to a steady increase of the forces of disorder, the primary cause of which is the starvation and misery caused by Civil War. The danger from this lies in a possible outbreak of the anti-foreign feeling latent in the Chinese people, and serious trouble of this nature could be expected if collapse occurs in China&apos;s already dangerous financial* A copy of the original telegram, No. 29 to Peking, is attached for convenience of reference.
voxposition. Any repetition of conditions reminiscent of the Boxer Rising of 1900 must entail foreign intervention on a serious scale.A point which deserves mention in this connection is that the retention of British troops in Shanghai, with the consequent expenditure entailed, is still essential and will remain so until a strong Central Government is established in China.The recent application for a loan of  20,000,000 to maintain China&apos;s financial stability has shown that a complete collapse is possible. Should this eventuate, it is hard to visualise what state of anarchy might supervene,, threatening serious loss to the large British investments in China.The second factor is the steady fall of China&apos;s trade during recent years, which is another external result of Civil War.As far as this country is concerned, however, the trade question may not be: considered as of such vital importance as to justify immediate action for the rehabilitation of China, although it should not be forgotten that a rehabilitated China would gradually come to provide a considerable field for trade recovery in the case of all countries. There is no doubt of the recuperative powers of the Chinese when released from Civil War and extortion.Even if, as stated above, the trade interests of this country are relatively limited, there is one point which needs careful consideration, and that is the effect of continued chaos in China upon the economics of Japan. The Chinese market is a vital one to that country; and the possibility cannot, therefore, be overlooked that, in the event of the situation in China reaching danger point, Japan might be compelled to take some unilateral action.There is no reason to suggest that Japan desires any such course; on the contrary, she would prefer joint discussion with Great Britain. Such joint discussion with, of course, the United States participating would obviate any need or possibility of unilateral action.In so far as the rehabilitation of China requires foreign financial assistance,, the two chief difficulties involved in this are the Consortium,* as at present constituted, and the feasibility of raising the money required. . : The existing four Power Consortium^ of Great Britain, France, the United States of America and Japan was formed in 1920, and, as long as the Corsortium Agreement exists, this country is bound to the British Group of Banks and to the other contracting parties to carry out its provisions. It is quite clear, however, that the Consortium could not deal with the delicate political problems which would arise in the question of China&apos;s rehabilitation and, furthermore, there are clauses in the Consortium Agreement with regard to control and foreign purchases, which modern conditions of financing and trade must render obsolete.With regard to foreign orders, the existing Agreement lays down that such orders must be placed by open tender, and it needs no emphasis to point out that, under present-day conditions Japan could secure almost any tender which came into the market. Modification of this clause to the effect that lending countries should obtain supply orders pro rata is essential.The question of control also represents a difficulty. Although the equal control called for by the Consortium Agreement is the goal to be aimed at, difficulty in attaining this goal results from the fact that the ideal of equal participation in a loan is outside the sphere of practical politics. If, for instance, the amount of the loan required were  20,000,000 it is unlikely that the four Powers of the existing Consortium could provide equal shares of such a loan. The larger amount of the loan would have to be subscribed in this country and the question would have to be faced as to whether token payments from those countries which could not subscribe their full quota could be accepted for the principle of equal control.The existing Consortium might either be supplemented by direct govern-mental co-operation, or else terminated on 12 months&apos; notice in accordance with the Agreement.China&apos;s existing debt is some  300,000,000, but for rehabilitation purposes the debts would be divided into four categories, namely : (1) The external and internal debts, secured upon the Customs and Salt Administrations.[11147]* This consists of four banking groupi
(2) The unsecured debts, e.g., Vickers, Marconi, Nishihara, Pacific Develop-ment Loans, &amp;c. , (3) Debts owing for material supplies. &apos;   (4) The railway debts.Of the above, it would appear that (1) need not necessarily enter into the picture, as with the exception perhaps of the Salt Loans, they are definitely secured. Rehabilitation of China would have to secure sufficient release of Salt funds to enable full liabilities secured on the Salt to be met. Although China might undoubtedly wish to borrow with a view to the conversion of her internal loans, on which 10 per cent, is being paid, and although such conversion would mean the release of the Customs funds earmarked for those loans, nevertheless, the supply of funds to meet such conversion would entail the provision of too large an amount, so that such a suggestion would have to be excluded.The question of the unsecured loans (2) and the material debts (3) should be excluded at the outset, although the creditors concerned are likely to raise this issue. Rehabilitation of China does not mean payment of loans which were in some cases undesirable from the beginning. The only chance of repayment of these loans, or of some future compounding with regard to repayment, lies in a rehabilitated China and must come after such rehabilitation.It is the position of the Railway Loans which requires consideration and the evolution of a scheme for the reconstruction and demilitarisation of the railways, the revenues from which would be the source of interest and amortisation of any loan, with the possible addition of the small free margin still existing on the Maritime Customs Revenue.There would in any case be strong and justifiable opposition to the issue of any loan to China, unless it included arrangements for paying or making an agreed composition in regard to the defaults on the existing Railway loans. It is clear that the existing defaults will remain defaults if present conditions continue.,1 The solution lies in a conversion of the existing debts into an accepted consolidation scheme involving all the railways. The total amount of the existing liabilities is estimated at  20,000,000.The essence of the whole matter, however, is the question of the control of the expenditure of the loan and of the revenues accruing for interest and amortisation of the loan. In no circumstances could a loan be made to China without such control, as the money would only be misspent and disappear. China would have to agree to the establishment of a Board of Control between the lending Powers and herself. Such a Board could be styled a Railway Commission or Administration, as advocated in the Report of the Department of Overseas Trade, which reads as follows : &quot; A Railway Commission or Administration, operated on lines similar to the Chinese Maritime Customs, would appear to be of the greatest benefit to China.&quot;There are other points to be taken into consideration in dealing with a rehabilitation question.The first one is that the Reconstruction Loan of 1913, which was made at the time of Yuan Shih-kai, failed in its purpose owing to the fall of Yuan, so that the permanent results of any new loan would depend on whether in backing Chiang Kai-shek (the head of the Nanking Government) the lending Powers were avoiding a similar risk.It has hitherto been the policy of the Powers not to associate themselves openly with any individual; but, in the event of a new loan being agreed to, that policy would have to be revised, and it would have to be made clear that Chiang Kai-shek and his Central Government were supported by the Powers. In this connection, it must be remembered that, when in former days the Powers acted in uniformity in China, the Chinese were careful to avoid interference with recognised and- accepted interests.The above gives rise to the second point requiring consideration, namely, that China is no longer unified, but consists of several independent provinces, so that a critic might raise the objection that the recognition&apos; and acceptance of these foreign interests might not be admitted by certain provinces. The answer to this is that, in addition to the amount required for the consolidation and reconstruction of the railways, a sum will have to be added for the balancing of the budget,&quot; part of which would entail definite payments to independent provinces in return for the demilitarisation of the railways and non-interference
with those administrations, the revenues of which are earmarked for foreign indebtedness.A third point is President Roosevelt&apos;s policy of forcing up the price of silver, which threatens to bring about a financial crisis in China. The policy of the Chinese Government in imposing an Export Tax on silver has hitherto averted a crisis and may continue to do so. A foreign loan would, of course, -counteract the danger of China being forced to devalue her currency owing to the drain of silver out of China; but this effect would be purely temporary and when the proceeds of the loan were exhausted the difficulties would be greater than ever, since an additional burden of foreign debt would have to be met. It would therefore be dangerous to make a foreign loan to China until either President Roosevelt has agreed to modify his policy, or at least promised not to push up the price of silver still further. If, however, America agrees to participate in the loan, which is an essential factor from every point of view, such participation would naturally increase American interests in China, and the question of modification of her silver policy would have to be considered by her.Another point for consideration is whether a reconstruction loan for China is outside either of the cases for which the Chancellor of the Exchequer allows favourable consideration. As, however, the reconstruction of China&apos;s railways would bring with it a proportionate amount of reconstructional work to the lending countries, such a loan might be considered to be of benefit to British industry in so far as it results in orders being placed here.The final point for consideration is the amount of the loan required, which, without specific details as to the amount of reconstruction required upon the railways, it is impossible to assert with any degree of exactitude. It might, however, be proposed that  15,000,000 to  20,000,000 might be borrowed for railway purposes to include conversion and reconstruction. A further considerable sum would be required both to secure the loyalty of independent provinces, and for such immediate administrative needs as the Board of Control might consider justifiable.The difficulties* in the way of any loan project are very great. There are the strained relations between China and Japan; there is fighting between Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist forces; and there is the absence of control by the Central Government over the majority of the provinces. No single Power could act on its own to restore the order which is necessary to put China on her feet, but co-operation with the interested Powers might succeed.It would appear that two alternatives present themselves, following upon China&apos;s recent application for a loan of  20 million. The first would be to inform the Japanese and the United States Ambassadors in London of the loan proposal recently made and of the reason for which it was rejected, and at the same time to express the desire to keep in close touch with them with a view to joint measures being taken to promote the financial reconstruction of China, as and when such measures may become practical. The other is to make the same com-munication about the loan and to invite immediate discussion here with repre-sentatives of Japan, the United States and also France (the &quot;Consortium&quot; Powers), concerning the feasibility of a rehabilitation project involving a joint offer to China to put her house in order upon the terms agreed upon during such discussion. Assuming the outcome of such discussion were to be an agreement that the Governments would do all in their power to encourage the -provision of suitable financial aid for China subject to the.adoption of reforms (which could only be set out in outline), it is possible that some British and foreign banks might put up a limited amount to carry the Chinese Government on till the main proposals had been worked out.N. F. W. F.* It should further be remembered that&apos; the raising of a loan depends primarily on the willingness of investors to subscribe, and that financial opinion puts a maximum limit of  15 to  20 millions as the amount likely to be subscribed here in the most favourable circumstances.
Sir John Simon to Sir A. Cadogan (Peking). (No. 29. Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, January 19, 1935.YOUR telegram No. 28 of 9th January : Chinese silver situation.The proposal put forward by Soong and Grayburn has been most carefully examined by an interdepartmental committee whose report will be sent to you by mail. The committee felt unable to recommend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consent to the flotation of the proposed loan, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank have now been informed, on the instructions of the Chancellor, that he is unable to consent to the loan because it does not fall under either of the two classes for which consideration was promised in the statement of the 19th July, 1934, namely : (a) sterling issues by a country within the sterling bloc, and (b) issues of which the proceeds are calculated mainly to produce direct benefit to British industry. While this is the ground on which the formal refusal rests, you may wish to explain privately to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank the reasons for which we have felt unable to regard the proposal put forward as likely to afford any real or lasting remedy to China&apos;s monetary difficulties.(1) These difficulties appear to be due to (a) lack of confidence that the Chinese dollar can remain convertible into silver in the face of the United States silver policy and the consequent flight of capital, and (b) to the adverse balance of payments, both causes leading to desire to export silver and consequent smuggling, hoarding and danger of a run on the banks. A foreign loan would not permanently remove these difficulties, and when its proceeds were exhausted the present difficulties would recur, while a fresh burden of foreign debt would have been superimposed and the available security of the Customs would have been mortgaged for no lasting benefit.(2) To return to a free silver standard would involve raising the Chinese dollar to at least Is. 8d., with no assurance against further rises. We cannot but feel that the consequent internal deflation and check to Chinese exports must have serious consequences in the absence of any corresponding rise in world prices, and Soong&apos;s arguments on this point do not convince us. The improvement in the situation of China&apos;s balance of trade, which he hopes to obtain from increased production and rationalisation, must inevitably be a slow process.(3) In particular we fear that a foreign loan would be regarded both by speculators and by distressed sellers of silver as an opportunity to export silver quickly before the loan is exhausted, and would thus lead to an accentuation of the evils which it is desired to avoid.It is our experience that disappointing results have usually followed, as in our own case in 1931, from attempts to maintain a threatened exchange position by means of foreign loans, unless the underlying causes of the exchange weakness have first been removed.The most obvious remedy would clearly be an understanding with the United States Government in regard to silver purchases. This is foreshadowed in paragraph 1 of your telegram No. 28, and we shall be glad to know whether Soong has any progress to report.The present policy of the export tax and equalisation duty on silver appears to us to have much to recommend it, at any rate as a temporary expedient, and we hope it will not be lightly abandoned. We are glad to note that the Hong Kong Government have promised co-operation so far as possible.Finally, you should emphasise our strong desire to assist China in co-opera-tion with the other Governments mainly concerned, and make it clear that the refusal to consent to the proposed loan is due solely to the belief that it would afford no real or lasting&apos; remedy. The refusal does not imply that His Majesty&apos;s Government are indifferent to the economic and financial difficulties of China, which, on the contrary, are a matter of grave concern to them.You should take an early opportunity of conveying orally to T. V. Soong and Minister of Finance the substance of the foregoing.(Repeated to Tokyo, No. 9; Washington, No. 9; and Paris, No. 13, Saving.)o
