These Articles are attached to this Report as an Appendix,3.      It will be recalled that we circulated a previous Report (CP.  835(34))  covering a Draft Convention which might have been suitable to be put forward as a self-contained proposal for international adoption.      It was so framed as to follow, as far as we deemed possible,  the lines of the Draft Articles adopted at Geneva on July 2nd,  1934, by the Committee for the Regulation of the Trade in and Private and State Manufacture of Arms and Implements of War.      In fact, however,  the articles of our convention differed considerably from the Geneva articles, as was pointed out in the covering report.4.      This Report was considered by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament (CP.   239 (34)), who recorded the following r e c omme agenda t i o ns j --1-
&quot;(a)    That the Committee were not prepared to recommend at the present moment that we should take the initiative at Geneva by putting forward, the Inter-departmental Committee&apos;s Draft Convention.(b)    That this recommendation might requirere consiaeration as a result of the forth-coming Debate in the House of Commons.&quot;and (c)  dealt with certain points to be developed in the Debate in the flouse of Commons by the Government&apos;s spokesman,5.      These recommendations were approved in the form above by the Cabinet at a meeting held on the 31st October, 1934., (Cabinet 33 (54), Conclusion 3).6.      It will be seen,  therefore,  that no decision on the principles or details contained in the Draft Convention Which we had drawn up was taken ana although we have now examined&apos;generally the details of the United States&apos;  Draft, we find it impossible to put forward any definite recommendations on this matter until the Cabinet have taken certain decisions which are essentially of a political character and which must govern any recommendations of detail which we have to submit.7.      The three principal points on which a decision isrequired may be summarised as follows(i) Are the^ Government prepared tojacceptj  as part of a Convention dealing only with the trade in and manufacture of arms,  a system of permanent and automatic supervision?8.      The United States&apos;  Draft contains definite provisions for such a system,  though its scope is more limited than the proposals for permanent and automatic supervision which were &quot;put forward at Geneva in December,  1933 by M.  Bourquin to form part of a general Disarmament Convention.
9.      The    last statement of Government policy in this connection -was contained in the United Kingdom Memorandum of January 29th, 1934 (paragraph 18 last sentence) which state s:-&quot;His Majesty:&apos; s Government affirm their willingness ?   . if general agreement is reached on all other issuesj  to agree to the application of a system of permanent and automatic supervisions to come    3, into force with the obligations of the Convention8&quot;.&quot;10.    We have thus no authority to consider the American proposals for supervision in connection with a convention, dealing only with the trade in and manufacture of arms. Nevertheless we would, draw attention to the very detailed   -report on Supervision? circulated to  the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament as Paper No. D.C. (&apos;M)(32) 1135 in which the difficulties of any form of supervision were examined..    The three Defence Departments and the Board of Trade still adhere to their opinions that certain provisions for the enforcement of supervision, &quot;besides raising great difficulties of domestic legislation, would be liable to lead to a disclosure of reserves and might gravely prejudice our capacity for expansion in time of emergency$ which forms the basis of our . system of industrial mobilisation.,11*    Furthermores in the opinion of the Defence Departments, a system of supervision such as is proposed in the American draft articles is superfluous,, since there are no limitations of armaments to be supervised..12.    On the other hand, the system of supervision proposed in the American articles is strictly circumscribed and there is little doubt that it will find a wide measure of support at Geneva though it may be anticipated that the French and certain other Delegations will wish to strengthen its provisions,,      In. any event, the United Kingdom Delegation could count on no support in opposing it.s    cmnd 4512.
(ii) Is it accepted that anylicensing system proposed under a Convention, dealing with the trade in.......and manufacture of arms should &quot;be extended......to,,., include.component parts?13c    The United States&apos; Draft provides for this extension, but certain Departments have always been impressed with the almost insuperable difficulties of defining a component part&apos;.14.    We are aware that there will be strong pressure at Geneva for the extension of the licensing system to component parts on the plea that to omit them would open the door to the evasion of any Convention;    in other words, that component parts of certain articles could be shipped to a foreign country and could be erected into a finished article there. The difficulties of definition are, particularly as regards aircraft and aircraft engines, undoubtedly very great but if we were so instructed by His Majesty&apos;s Government an attempt would be made to see if any possible definitions could be eve IvetU(iii) Is there to be publicity as regards orders, and imports^and exports, and is suchpublicity to be by number or weight or by value?15o    The United States&apos; Draft makes provision for copies of all orders, of import and of export licences to oe sent to Geneva, and includes publicity by number or weight and not by value a16o    The three  defence Departments have already pointed out that, in their view, it was highly undesirable on strategic grounds to agree to publicity of orders for our own use, although there would be no objection to publicity as rega rds exports      But past experience has shown that importing countries will not agree to publicity for their purchases unless similar publicity is accorded to manufactures by
exporting countries for their own use *17.    In the opinion of the Defence Departments, publicity for all production which would include manufactures for our own purposes would, over a period.;, enable our reserves to be calculated.      In this connection we are informed that it is now difficult to obtain information concerning the reserves of armaments of any country, and that it would not be right to assume that by according publicity to all production we should only be disclosing information in regard to our own reserves which is already in the possession of other countries.      On the other hand there would be no such publicity unless it were generally accepted and we should presumably obtain information as to the reserves of other countries which we do not now possess.      In this connection it should be remarked that the idea underlying the American draft proposals is to put an end to the secrecy at present surrounding the production of armaments and to the mutual suspicion which this secrecy engenders18.    The Defence Departments also fear that the publicity   of orders to domestic manufacturers and the burdens of administra-tive formalJ.ti.es might discourage them from taking such orders in future.19.    We have proposals to put forward which, in our opinion,would, in certain respects,  strengthen the united States&apos; Draft.Before submitting them, however, we would ask that the cabinet would give us definite political guidance on the following three questions c-(i) Are the Government prepared to accept, as part of a Convention dealing only with the trade in and manufacture of arms, a system of permanent and automatic supervision?(ii)    Is it accepted that any licensing systemproposed under the Convention dealing with the trade in and manufacture of arms should be extended to include component parts?
(iii)    Is there to be publicity as regards orders,and imports and exports, and. is such publicity to be by number or weight,  or by value?(Intld. ) A.E.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 18th December,  1934.
