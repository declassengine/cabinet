At their Meeting on January 9th, 1935 (Cabinet 2 (35)Conclusion 4)  the Cabinet agreed that the Report of theUnemployment Insurance Statutory Committee, set up by theUnemployment Insurance Act, 1934,  on the question of theInsurance of Agriculture against Unemployment, should bereferred immediately to a Cabinet Committee composed as followsThe Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;1&quot; The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, The Secretary of State for Scotland, The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Minister of Labour,The Fi rs t C commision si one r of Works.2. Under Section 20 of the Unemployment Insurance Act,1934, the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee was required to give immediate consideration to the question of the insurance of agriculture against unemployment.      After hearing evidence from all the interests concerned, the Statutory Committee have made a unanimous Report , a Copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix I.3. The Statutory Committee&apos;s Report embodies a definitescheme of insurance which is set out in detail in Part II thereof.      The main outlines of the scheme are as follows:-+The Chancellor of the Exchequer only undertook to serve on this Committee on the understanding that he could be represented by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.
(i) The scheme applies, with certain exceptions, to all persons employed under a contract of service in agriculture, horticulture and forestry.(ii) The numbers&apos;to be insured are approximately 750,000. (iii)The scheme is based on an assumed rate of unemploy-ment of 7.this assumption is  justified in detail in an appendix to the Report of the Committee.(iv) The contributions would be 4dc a week for adult males from employer, employed and Exchequer respectively, i,.e,a total of 1/- a. week;    there would be lower contributions for women and young persons and a discount for long hirings of six or twelve months,(v) The rates of benefit are 12/- a week for an adult male and 10/Sd0 for an adult females with 6/6d. a week for a wife or other adult dependant, and either 2/- a week for each dependent child or 3/- for the first dependent child and 2/6d. for each of the other children,  subject to a maximum in either case of 30/- a week in all.(vi)Por the first year the contribution income according to the estimate would be  1,529,000 while benefit would be  1,303,000 and administrative expenses  191,000, leaving a surplus of  35,000 with the higher children&apos;s rate (or  70,000 with the lower children&apos;s rate).(vii) Generally, the conditions and disqualifications for benefit under the general scheme would be applied to the agricultural scheme with three important exceptions:-(a) The initial qualification for benefit would be 80 contributions paid at any time instead of30 contributions paid during the last two years as under the general scheme;(b) Benefit would be allowed at the rate of 2 weeks for the first 10 unexhausted contributions and one further week for every 2 additional un-exhausted contributions beyond 10, with a maximum of 50 weeks in the year.    This compares with a minimum of 26 weeks of benefit for 30 contributions in the last two years under the general scheme, plus additional weeks up to a total of 52 in the year according to the past record;    and
(c) In general,  the Anomalies Regulation limiting &quot;benefit for seasonal workers in the general scheme would not apply^(viii) The Agricultural industry which had no share in the incurring, will have no share in paying off the debt under the general scheme,(ix) At the outset contributions should run for six months before any benefit is paid,(x) There would, be separate accounts but not a separate fund for the agricultural scheme0(xi) The scheme applies to Scotland as well as to England and &quot;Wales.4,       We recommend the Cabinet to agree in principle with the policy of insuring agriculture against Tinemployment for the fo11owing reasons:(i) It was felt that the proposal to set up an Unemployment Insurance Scheme for Agriculture y/ould, so far as England and Wales v/ere concerned, be generally accepted by the workers.    It would be popular with the farmers in some districts, but in others, especially those in which non-arable farming prevailed,  it would be unpopular.      In Scotland the proposal would not be welcomed by the farmers, while the attitude of the workers was on the whole doubtful.(ii)  In view of the fact that the Unemployment Act, 1934, specially remitted to the Statutory Committee    &quot; -* the duty of making practicable proposals for agriculture, the Government may be regarded as having pledged itself to introduce a scheme of insurance for agriculture, provided a practicable scheme were forthcoming.      There could be no doubt that the Statutory Committee had produced a practicable scheme.
G&quot;.t &apos;H *J k:     wThere is no doubt that, quite apart from political considerations,   there is a good case at the present time for insuring agriculture against unemployment.      Agriculture was omitted from the general insurance scheme in 1920 mainly because it was then believed that there was not much unemployment in the industry and because of hostility on the part both of employers and of workers.     These reasons having now disappeared there is,  on general grounds, the same case for insuring agriculture that there is for insuring industry, namely -(a) That for those who lose employment there are, as a first line of defence against distress by unemploy-ment, benefit drawn as a right in respect of contributions paid and without regard to other means;    and(b) That those who exhaust their claim to benefit should be adequately cared for thereafter by public authorities, but that in that cage regard should be had to other resources so that the public funds should notbe called upon when they are not needed.
5o If the Cabinet accept this recommendation we are strongly of opinion that the necessary legislation should be introduced and passed into law as soon as practicable in order that the scheme may come into full operation with the least possible delay:    that is to say that we should be paying benefit and not merely collecting contributions, next winter.6. We agree generally with the scheme of the StatutoryCommittee and in any case it is obviously desirable to follow that scheme as closely as possible.      There are, however, certain important points to which our attention has been directed by the Minister of Labour and to which we have given special consideration;(1) Finance of the Scheme.    It will be observed that the Statutory Committee budget for a small surplus in the first year after benefit becomes payable.    It seemed likely to the Minister of Labour that,  owing to the nature of the qualifications for benefit, the amount of benefit paid for any given volume of unemployment might increase progressively for several years and it was not therefore clear to him that there is a sufficient probability that the  scheme would remain solvent after the first,or at any rate the second,year of benefit. These doubts were officially communicated by the Ministry of Labour to the Statutory Committee in a letter dated 11th; January, and the Committee have replied in a letter dated 17th January.      A copy of this correspondence is attached as Appendix II.The Statutory Committee say in effect that any estimate of the proportion of unemployment that would under their scheme be covered by benefit after the first year, must be so entirely speculative as to be worthless, and that the scheme itself affords ample time and adequate machinery for preserving the balance of agricultural contributions and expenditure.     After
giving their reasons for the view that the solvencyof the scheme is assured until after the end of thefourth year of benefit, the Statutory Committeepoint out that at the end of each year they will,after consultation with the parties concerned,report on the financial condition of the agricul-tural scheme and that &quot;before it can under anylikely circumstances become necessary to revisecontributions or benefits, there will have been atleast three years experience of the full working ofthe scheme by agricultural workers, their employersand the Ministry&apos;.      The Statutory Committee^letter concludes as follows :-&quot;Uncertainty as to the proportion of unemployment ranking for benefit is only one of the uncertainties in-separable from the launching of any insurance scheme.    It is only in the working of a scheme that the necessary experience can be gained.     The Committee&apos;s proposals are designed both to give time for getting that experience and to yield a scheme which can be adjusted readily in the light of experience&quot;.In view of this reply we do not think thatany further action need be taken on the point.Benefit rates.    The proposed basic rates (12/-for a man, 18/6d. for man and wife) are the highest that can be paid for a 4d. contribution.A point of some difficulty arises with regard to the allowances for children.      The Statutory Committee offer two alternatives (see para. 91 of Report) viz: either 2/- for each child or 3/- for the first child and 2/6d. for each other child, on the
analogy of the Unemployment Assistance Board&apos;s Regulations.      The second alternative is possible financially and we are satisfied that as soon as the Report is published there will be great pressure in and out of Parliament- for its adoption.      In these circumstances we think that it would be better to make the concession at the outset, and we therefore recommend the Cabinet to approve the second alternat-ive.      At the same time we must warn the Cabinet that this decision must inevitably lead to a strong demand for a corresponding change in the general scheme (at an annual cost of about  1,000,000) and this may prove to be a matter of some difficulty.3) Contribution qualification for benefit.    The initial contribution qualification is easier for agriculture than for industry, viz,,  20 paid at any time instead of 30 in the last two years.    Subject to this, the rules proposed by the Statutory Committee, as compared with those under the general unemployment insurance scheme., are less favourable to contributors who regularly suffer from severe unemployment (over 16 weeks in the year).     When the periods of unemployment are shorter, they will in general be covered under either scheme.      The agricultural contributor, however, gets the advantage of the lower contribution which the rule under his scheme makes possible.      Per this reason we recommend the Cabinet to adopt the special rules proposed by the Statutory Committee;    it is probably not possible for financial reasons to adopt the rules of the general scheme..-) Irish migratory labour, etc.    The Statutory Committeedeal with this subject in paragraphs 74-79 of theirReport and in effect suggest that in the first in-stance, these labourers should be given the option of exemption from the scheme in the hope that they will!7.
exercise it and so not draw &quot;benefit;    if this does not work, then they suggest that the seasonal workers regulation should he applied to this class with such modification as might seem to he demanded.    We are disposed to agree with the Minister of Labour that this would be taking too great a risk and that the proper way to deal with Irish migratory labourers would be to exclude them at the outset compulsorily from the scheme while making their employers pay the employers&apos; share of the contribution.      The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was unable to be present when we dis-cussed this matter, and our provisional conclusion is subject to further consultation between the Minister of Labour and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Home Secretary in regard to the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland respectively.(5) Private Gardeners.    These number some 125,000 and theStatutory Committee propose, see paragraphs 80-86, thatinstance bethey should in the first / excluded, but that the Act should contain power to include them subsequently by regulation.      We recommend that this proposal be adopted.(6) Reduced contributions for long hiriags.    The Statutory Committee propose (paragraphs 116-120 of the Report) that in the case of a yearly hiring there should be a reduction in the rate of contribution (for an adult male) of 25 per cent,  and in the case of a six-monthly hiring of 12-J- per cent.      The reduced stamp for each quarter is to be affixed in advance.The inclusion of aix monthly, hirings introduces a special danger because it would cover hirings for the six summer months with the possibility of heavy claims on the Fund during the winter.There are also a number of quite serious adminis-trative difficulties of detail in this proposal.8.
Owing, however, to the importance attached to this point (particularly as regards Scotland and the North of England) we recommend that the proposals he accepted.i^) Seasonal workers.    The Statutory Committee propose(paragraphs 104-107 of their Pveport)  that,  generally,the rule under the general scheme, known as the seasonal workers Regulation, limiting the benefit of seasonal workers,  shall not apply in agriculture.It is necessary to draw attention to the StatutoryCommittee&apos;s proposal on this point, since the seasonal workers Regulation under the general scheme has been thesubject of a good deal of political comment.    We thinkshould be accepted, that the proposal/-It can be justified by the special-circumstances of agriculture.    The Statutory Committee areshortly going to consider whether the seasonal workersregulation under the general scheme needs any modifi-cation, and, if persons interested have any represent-ations to make in the light of what may be proposed for agriculture, they will no doubt have their opportunity.7. Our recommendations and conclusions may be summarised asfollows :-(l) That the Cabinet accept in principle the poliC3&apos;&quot; of insuring agriculture against unemployment.(S) That the necessary legislation shouldbe introduced and passed into law assoon as practicable so as. to ensurethat next winter may see payment ofbenefit and not merely collection ofcontributions as will be the case during the first six months of operation.(3) That the Minister of Labour should beauthorised to arrange for the preparation of a draft Bill for examination by the Home Affairs Committee and the subsequent approval of the Cabinet.(4) That, in the course of preparing the Bill, the Minister of Labour should in matters of detail consult with the Treasury,  the Ministry of Health,and other Departments concerned.
(5)  That the provisions of the draft Bill, should follow the  Statutory Committee1 s scheme as closely as possible.(6) That the allowances for children should &quot;be in accordance with the Statutory Committee&apos;&apos;s second alternative,  viz:  3/-for the first child and 2/6d0 for each other child.(7) That the special rules proposed by the Statutory Committee regarding.the con-tribution qualification for benefit should be accepted.(8)  That,  subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Home Secretary respectively, Irish migratory labourers should be excluded at the outset compulsorily from the scheme, while their employers should be required to pay the employers1  share of the contribution.(9) That the Statutory Committee&apos;s proposals regarding private gardeners,  reduced contributions for long hirings and seasonal workers should be adopted,(10) That the Cabinet should take note that the Minister proposes at an early date to lay the Report of the Statutory Committee before Parliament,Signed on behalf of the Committee JOHN GILMOURGhairman.Whi t ehal1 Gardens, S.W.1. 17th January,  1935.

To the Eight Hon. Oliver Stanley, M,P., Minister of Labour.Sib, .PART I. INTRODUCTION. (I) Terms op Reference and Procedure,1. By Section 20 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee are required as soon as may be after the passing of the Act, to make such proposals as may seem to them practicable for the insurance against unemployment of persons engaged in employment in agriculture and to make a report to the Minister of Labour containing the proposals and any recommendations with respect thereto. By Section 20 (2) the Committee are required to give notice of their intention to enquire into&apos; the matter aforesaid, and to take into consideration any representations submitted to them by persons appearing to them to represent employers or persons employed or persons engaged in agriculture or by any Government department. By Section 20 (3) the, expression &quot; agriculture&quot; is defined to include horticulture and forestry.2. We were appointed by you, as Minister of Labour, on 18th. July, 1934, to be the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Com-mittee. We held our first meeting on 24th July, 1934, and at that meeting decided to give the notice required by Section (2) of the Act. The notice was published on 7th August, 1934, and was sent also to all the associations of employers and employees who seemed likely to be concerned in the matter. The notice asked that any representations by persons representing employers, or persons employed, or persons engaged in agriculture, should be sent to us on or before 29th September, 1934. The period allowed was extended in the case of certain associations which asked for further time.3. The subject of unemployment insurance in agriculture has been under consideration by us at nine meetings between 11th October and 20th December, 1934; at five of these meetings oral evidence was taken. Written memoranda and oral evidence have been submitted by the following Government Departments and representatives of employers and workers : Government Departments. Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Labour; -Department of Agriculture for Scotland.27162 A 2

In addition, to various,, individual representations,, we have received, also a, letter from The. Counties Agricultural and General Workers&apos; Unions, and . Mempnula from the Dunmow Friendly Society, and The Scottish Landed Estates Friendly, Society. The two last-mentioned bodies are affiliated to the National Federation of Rural Approved Societies and were represented in the oral evidence given by the.:witnesses from that Federation.    ,.5... We desire, to express our thanks for the help given to us by all these ,bodies.;., we, appreciated::particularly the readiness of. those who appeared before;us-.to.treat the. occasion as one for frank and informal discussion of ,a practical -issue. - In view of the. full pub-&apos;]the&quot;d investigations of the same problem made of recent years by the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance and by others, it, appeared to. us that ,there was no occasion for. printing a formal report of these discussions, though we made it. clear to those who came before,us that they were, at liberty to publish in any way they desired the representations or information that they submitted.6. We should add that, while in framing the proposals set out in Part II of our Report, we have drawn largely on the results of our discussions with the various bodies that appe&apos;ared before us, we have not. formally, or informally laid our specific proposals before them, or. endeavoured to secure their assent thereto. It appeared inappropriate-priate to take anysuch steps, since our proposals are recommendations only to the Minister of Labour. It would.have been idle and embarrassing-rassing for us to negotiate with outside bodies on measures which the Minister&apos;might not feel prepared to accept.(2) Historical Survey.7. As we have referred to previous investigations and public dis-cussions of the subject of our Eeport, it will be convenient briefly to review them. The question of extending unemployment insur-ance to agriculture has repeatedly been under consideration since the general application of insurance to other industries in 1920.
c8. At the end of 1926&apos;a; Commitfce; was appointed&apos; by the Agricul-fcural Wages Board1, underthe Chah:ihariship&quot;bf: Sir Henry Row &quot; to enquire into the extent&apos; to which the Unemployment Insurance Scheme may.be made applicable and beneficial to agricultural workers &quot;. The Committee reported in 1921 that there was general opposition by both employers and workers, to extending the existing insurance scheme to agriculture, and that there was ho evidence as to how far&apos; a special schetoefbr agriculture would be acceptable9. The subject was considered in 1926 by another Committee, also under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Row, appointed as an Inter-depaftmental Committee1 by the- two Ministers concerned with agriculture. Two reports were presented, one signed by the Chair-man, two independent members and three workers&apos; representatives, and the other signed by two independent members of three em-ployers&apos; Representatives. As regards England and Wales, the majority report recommended the, adoption of a special scheme providing the same rates of benefit as the general scheme, but with lower rates of contribution. The minority report stated that it did hot appear that the immunity from the risk of unemployment-ployment enjoyed by agriculture had decreased since 1920, and that, therefore, there was no case for a scheme.- Both reports agreed that: unemployment insurance should not be applied to agriculture in Scotland. After considering these reports the Government announced in Parliament their decision that no oase had been made out for an extension- of unemployment insurance to agriculture.10. On 10th&apos; November, 1925&apos;, a Committee was appointed by the Minister of Labour &quot; to consider in the light of experience gained in the working of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, what changes in the&apos; Scheme, if any, ought to be made-&quot;. This Committee, known as&apos; the&apos; Unemployment Insurance Committee, was under the Chairmanship of the Rt. Hon. Lord Blanesburgh, G.B.E. In their Report, published in 1927, the Committee in-dicated that in connection with the question of the provision of unemployment insurance&apos; for wdrkers iii agriculture, they had read the Report of Sir Henry Row&apos;s Committee, which had only recently been published, and that they were in favour of leaving things as they were.11. On the second reading of the Unemployment Insurance Bill in the House of Commons on 21st November,, 1929, the Minister of Labour stated that the Government were trying to see if they could evolve a scheme for agriculture which could be considered and dis-cussed by the interests concerned.12. On 29th January, 1930, Mr. Gruhdy, M.P., moved in the House of Commons &apos;&apos; that in the opinion of this House unemploy-ment insurance , should be extended to include agricultural workers &quot;. The Minister of Labour (Miss Bondfield) spoke towards the end of the debate and generally welcomed the&apos; Motion, but27182 a 3 &apos;243
pointed out some of-the difficulties that would-fequire to be overcome before a scheme of unemployment&apos; insurance for agriculture could be instituted, .The three outstanding,points of.difficulty were :-(1) the absence of reliable information as to the rate of unem-ployment among workers in agriculture ;.. - ..(2) the financial basis of a scheme ; and(3) the need for securing, if possible, the agreement of both&apos; employers and workers to a scheme of unemployment insurance.A-division was taken on the Motion which was carried by 185 votes against 82.13. In May, 1930, the Minister of Labour received representatives of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party Agricultural Advisory Committee and the Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union, and discussed with them the broad outline of a scheme.14. On 18th June, 1930, in the House of Commons Committee of Supply, the question was again raised-and the Minister of Labour-made, the following statement: &quot; I have said before, and I repeat it to-night, that one of my main reasons for wishing to see agricultural workers brought within the Insurance Scheme is because I am convinced that we must try to break down the wall of. separation between workers in industry and workers in agriculture. Whether we like it or not, there will have to be an interchange of labour between the towns and the country-side. And why not? It is a most wholesome thing that there should be this interchange, and all we require is that the wages and general conditions shall be as applicable to the agricultural worker as to the town worker. I hope we shall go ahead with the discussions which have begun and get some agreed scheme which we can present to the House. It is obvious that there are two parties to the scheme;.in fact there are more than two parties, but the primary parties are the farm workers and the farmers, and I am hoping that the negotiations will enable us to get some-where near to an agreed scheme.&quot;.15. On 1st August, 1930, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in the House of Commons that the Government was giving considera-tion to the extension of unemployment insurance to agricultural workers, but that at the moment he was not able to make any pronouncement about it.16. On 18th November, 1930, the Minister of Labour had further discussions with representatives of the National Union of Agricul-tural Workers, the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union and the Trades Union Congress, and on 19th November, 1930, the question was again debated in the House of Commons on the Motion &quot; That
in the opinion of this -House unemployment insurance should be extended to include agricultural workers.&quot; This motion was &quot; talked out.&quot; ..;17. On 9th December, 1930, the Royal Commission on Unern-ployment Insurance was appointed. Their Terms -of GReference included enquiry into the future scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts,&apos; and the question whether agriculture Should &apos;be included thus came under their consideration.18. The Report of the Royal Commission was presented-in November, 1932. The Commission took the view that &quot; broadly, insurable employment will cover productive industry and its ancillary services&quot;, and that &quot; uninsured occupations will be those concerned in what might be called the general administrative services Government, Police, Educational, but this, of course, gives only the simplest rubric and leaves unsolved many marginal problems. On this account of the matter, agriculture, a productive service, would fall within the class of insured industries, but the conditions of employment in agriculture differ in important ways from conditions in other industries, so that the matter cannot be thus simply settled &quot;.19. The Commission considered the question at length in later paragraphs of their report, and came to the conclusion that &quot; there are strong arguments for the extension of unemployment insurance to agriculture &quot;. In view, however, of the difficulties involved in the question, the majority of the Royal Commission did not recom-mend the inclusion of agriculture in the general insurance scheme, but recommended that the Statutory Commission, which the Royal Commission proposed should be set up in connection with the general scheme of unemployment insurance &quot; should forthwith explore, with representatives of the industry and the Government Departments concerned, the possibility of devising a special scheme of insurance for agriculture which will secure the co-operation of those engaged in the industry and overcome the difficulties to which we have drawn attention &quot;.20. The Minority Report of the Royal Commission was in favour of including agriculture within the general scheme of unemployment insurance, but with lower rates of contribution and benefits.21. In December, 1932, the Minister of Labour (Sir Henry Betterton) received a deputation from the National Union of Agri-cultural Workers, on the subject, and in reply to the Union the Minister referred to the recommendations of the Royal Commission and said that the representations which the deputation had made would be borne in mind when these were being considered.22. During the following months, numerous resolutions were passed at district meetings of the National Union of Agricultural Workers throughout the country, urging the enactment of a scheme27462 a 4
of unemployment insurance to cover all persons employed in agri-culture; and on 25th July, 1933, the Minister of Labour received a further deputation from the Union. On 26th September, 1933, the Minister also received a deputation from the Agricultural Section of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union when arguments were advanced in favour of the inclusion of agricultural workers within the scope of unemployment insurance.23. Section 20 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, broadly carries out the recommendations of the majority of the Royal Commission,(3) New Factors in the Present Position.24. In the foregoing section we have described briefly the work and the conclusions of various Committees and Commissions which, in the past fourteen years, have examined the problem of insurance against unemployment in agriculture. Our position differs in three ways from that of these previous enquirers : in respect of our terms of reference, in respect of the information available about unem-ployment in agriculture and in respect of the attitude of those concerned in the industry, as employers or employees.25. Our. terms of reference, as set out in Section 20 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, have been cited above. Under this reference we have considered that our primary duty is not to discuss the question of principle as to whether insurance in agri-culture is desirable or not, but to frame, if we can, a scheme of insurance, in order that His Majesty&apos;s Government may decide to proceed or not to proceed further with the matter, in the light of concrete proposals. Our Report has to be laid before Parliament, and we are at libex-ty to add to our proposals any comments that appear relevant to the decision tha&quot;t Parliament may be asked to take. This we do in Part III of our Report. But our first business is to submit proposals, as if a decision to proceed with insurance had already been taken.26. In respect of the information available as to the extent oi unemployment in agriculture, the position has been changed by the population census for 1931. In that census there was included a question as to unemployment; those filling up the schedules were asked to state, in respect of each person normally seeking employ-ment, whether on the day of the census he was out of work, and to give the name and business of his last employer. The statistical value of the information which can be derived from such a question in a census has often been a matter of dispute. For Great Britain it is possible to put this issue to the test, by comparing the results of the census enquiry with the unemployment recorded at the same date by the Ministry of Labour in the working of insurance. The broad result of the comparison is to show a striking agreement between the census figures and the Ministry of Labour figures, industry by industry.
9 /527. For agriculture, since it is not now insured against uneiri-ployment, no similar comparison can be made, but subsidiary confirmation&apos;of the correctness of the census figures is afforded by two further comparisons. In the first place, it is possible to compare the returns of agricultural unemployment in the censuses for England and Wales and for Scotland respectively. We find in the results of these two censuses, taken simultaneously but by separate authorities, a striking agreement in the rates of unem-ployment, in each of the main occupational groups into which those engaged in agriculture, horticulture and forestry are divided. In the second place, it has proved possible by examination of the returns of Approved Societies operating in rural areas under the National Health Insurance Scheme, to obtain from the contribution records of their members data as to unemployment. This com-parison, for which we are indebted to the Government Actuary, yields for rural areas a percentage of unemployment very close to that which we derive for agriculture by adjustment of the census figures.28. These and other comparisons, indicating the unexpectedly high degree of importance to be attached to the census returns of unemployment, are set out fully in the first part of Appendix A to our Report, on the Statistics of Unemployment in Agriculture. Figures compiled from the census returns refer directly only to the day on which the census was taken. They have to be adjusted in various ways, in attempting to deduce, for a scheme of insurance, the average rate of unemployment to be expected over busy and slack seasons and good and bad years together. The adjustments made by us are described in detail in the second part of Appendix A. The census is a starting point only. But, accepting it as a starting point, we find ourselves to-day in a position radically different from that of any previous Committee that has investigated our problem.29. First, the census returns, with the subsidiary information from the Approved Societies in rural areas, dispose finally of the argument that insurance is not needed in agriculture because there is practically no&apos; unemployment. The general rate of unemployment in agriculture which, from the census figures, we are compelled to take as the basis of our proposals for insurance is 7-5 per cent. This is materially higher than the rate of unemployment in a number of industries already insured under the general scheme.30. Second, while the census results are only a starting point for actuarial calculations, and while these calculations in their final form rest partly on estimates, it is fair to say that, in proposing now to apply unemployment insurance to agriculture, we have a basis for actuarial calculations materially better than was available, either when the first scheme of compulsory insurance, covering two and a half million persons in a few industries was introduced in 1911, or when insurance against unemployment was made general in 1920. We refer again to this point in the last section of our Eeport.
. 31. Third, from, the determination of an unexpectedly high rate of unemployment in agriculture, it follows that any effective scheme of.insurance must be more expensive in contributions than it has been customary to contemplate.32. Ltl respect of the attitude of those concerned in agriculture, towards, proposals for unemployment insurance, there has been a progressive change since the, matter was first discussed seriously fourteen years ago.33. In 1921, as has been stated above, the first Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Eew reported general opposition both by employers and by workers to the inclusion of agriculture in the existing insurance scheme and doubt as to the acceptability of a special scheme.34. In 1926, a second Committee under the same chairman, found the employers&apos; organisations both in England and Wales and in Scotland as firmly opposed as ever to any form of insurance, but stated that in England and Wales &quot; practically all the evidence placed before the Committee on behalf of the workers was in favour of the extension of the principle of unemployment insurance to agriculture.&quot; In Scotland the Committee of the Farm Servants&apos; Union were unanimously opposed to inclusion in the general scheme and not prepared to commit themselves either for or against a special scheme. Between 1926 and 1930 there was a change in the views of the Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union, and they became strongly in favour of unemployment insurance for agriculture.35. In 1934, during the course of our enquiry, the trade unions of agricultural workers in England and Wales presented to us strong demand for insurance at special rates of contribution and benefit but otherwise on the same lines as other workers. The Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union took the same line as the Englisli Trade Unions, and submitted that &quot; opinion amongst farm worker in Scotland has grown rapidly in recent years in favour of insurance and the majority of the workers are now in favour of a scheme of insurance.&apos;&apos;36, The trade unions, both in Scotland and in England and Wales, include only a small proportion less than 10 per cent. of the agricultural workers. Another type of association the approved societies operating health insurance in rural areas makes it possible to obtain a more extensive view of opinion among them The Federation of Rural Approved Societies, covering nearly 300,000 insured persons in rural areas, submitted a memorandum showing clearly the development of this opinion. In 1926, the Federation had not considered and expressed no view on the principle of unemployment insurance. In 1929 the Annual Con-ference of the Federation adopted the report of a Special Com-rnittee favouring insurance under a special scheme in,England and Wales, but proposing the exclusion of Scotland. In August, 1934, after an extensive; enquiry undertaken to ascertain the attitude of
agricultural workers, tbe Annual Conference of the Federation adopted a resolution urging the introduction of insurance in agri-culture, and including Scotland under an independent scheme. In view of what is said below as to the special case of Scotland, it is relevant to note that this Conference took place in Edinburgh, that the resolution was unanimous,&apos; and that of the total membership covered by the Federation; 115,000,or. more than a third are in three Scottish Societies.&apos;&quot; Not&apos; all these members are persons employed in agriculture. The proportions that would come under a scheme of unemployment insurance vary from one society to another; in particular.societies the proportion may be as high as 75 per cent, or 80 per cent. ; the figure giverTto us in oral evidence for all the societies taken together was 55 per cent, in the male membership. But all the members are persons living in rural districts and reflecting rural opinion. The changed attitude of the Scottish workers was indicated to us not only through the general resolution already cited but directly as well, on behalf of the largest rural approved society in Scotland-with a membership of 90,000.37. Among employers also  in England and Wales, we found a change of attitude from the time of former enquiries. WThile majority of branches of the National Farmers&apos; Union were still opposed to insurance, even under a special scheme, a substantial minority favoured it. The actual figures given to us in oral evidence were 30 branches against and 16 in favour; it was clear that often, where the branch opposed insurance, this was only a majority view. Even the majority, appeared to object not so much on principle as on &quot;grounds of practicability and of the risk that insurance would further casualise the industry and endanger good relations betv- een employer and worker. The representatives of other bodies which appeared before us from the side of employers, such as the Central Landowners&apos; Association and the.Land Agents Society, while associating themselves in general terms; with the National Farmers&apos; Union, were equally far from whole hearted or unanimous opposition&apos;; they recognised the &quot; psychological &quot; or &quot; status &quot; argument for putting agricultural labourers, when unemployed, into the same position&apos;as men of other industries. The Central Landowners&apos; Association submitted to us a detailed scheme of insurance.38. In Scotland the position is different and may conveniently be discussed more fully at this point of our Report, even at risk of anticipating some of our proposals. , .39. In appearing before us, the representatives of the National Farmers&apos; Union of Scotland submitted a summary of replies from 21 county or area secretaries, in response to a recent circular from the Union asking for the views of local committees or members of the Union. Only one of those replies (for the county, of Angus) indicated any substantial division of opinion; the rest were all strongly opposed to the extension of unemployment insurance to
agriculture.- The -main ground fox. this opposition, as given repeatedly in similar phrases, was that unemployment amongst agricultural workers in the ,district,concerned was &quot; very little,&quot; &quot;negligible,&quot; &quot;almost .non-existent,&quot; &quot;,practically of no account,&quot; or even that here was &quot; -no :unemployment.&quot; Sub-sidiary arguments were ,(1) that introduction of -insurance would interfere with-.the ^present-.system of yearly,or.six monthly hiringa and lead to shorter engagements and standing men off in slack seasons;.(2) that the men themselves did.not desire insurance.,40. We recognise the-sincerity and .strength of ,the views thus laid before us&apos;.by. the National Farmers&apos; XTriipn of Scotland, in opposition to unemployment insurance ip any form. They were supported substantially by the .Scottish CKainber of Agriculture. But we are not abje to reconcile.with our other evidence the main argument urged in support of these views, or to discover any marked distinction between Scotland and the rest of Great Britain in respect of agricultural.unemployment.41. The census statistics of 1931, set out at length in Appendix A, show for every important agricultural pr horticultural Occupation a percentage of unemployment in .Scotland which is actually higher than the corresponding percentage iP Epgland and Wales. This does not apply to forestry but it applies to both sexes; the only significant exceptions are the small groups of farm bailiffs &quot; and &quot; farm foremen.&quot; The differences between Scotland and; the rest of Britain, though. all in one direction, are not great. When allowance is made for the fact -that, at the census date, the farming season.wouldibe less advanced in Scotland than further south, it is&apos;fair to say that, occupationiby occupation Scotland shows1 about the same percentage of unemployment as England and Wales, rather than a higher percentage.42. As from one, occupation to another, the&apos; percentage of unem-ployment varies greatly. Men engaged in tending livestock (shepherds, cattlemen, horsemen) have, in.England arid Wales as in Scotland, relatively,little -unemployment, just over 2 per cent. The general body of agricultural jabpurers and farm servants, out-side these three special classes, have a- much higher percentage of unemployment 10-0 in England and Wales and 10-9 in Scotland. The occupations with relatively little unemployment form a much smaller proportion of the whole jn England and Wales than they do in Scotland; the men tending livestock, are, in the&apos;former country, less than one-third of all the men.employed in agriculture proper, while in the latter they aie nearly,t,wo-thirds. As a consequence, the apparent paradox results that, though in each separate. agricul-tural occupation Scotland at the census date , had a ; higher per-cehtage ofs uhempibynient than Englahd and-Wales, ,iri, all these occupations taken together it-;had, --for men at ,least, a lower percentage.
IIP 43. But the difference between the two countries is not great.&apos; Taking agriculture,1 horticulture and forestry &quot;together; the uriem-ployment percentage for males, as shown by the census,&apos;is 7&quot;0 in Englahd arid Wales and 6-2 in Scotland. &apos;- Among females; unein-ployment is higher in Scotland than&apos; in the&apos; rest -of Britain for all occupations taken together, as it is for each separate occupation ; the percentage is 5-2 in England and... Wales, and .7-0, in..Scotland. For both sexes taken together, the percentages are .6/93&apos;in England and Wales and 6-25 in Scotland. ,, The difference, at.the census date, between English and Scottish agricultural Unemployment, as re-vealed by the census conducted.and compiled on identical principles in the two countries, is as the difference between 11 and 10.44. If this census result stood alone, it could&apos; not- be disregarded. But it is confirmed iiyother ways.&apos; &apos; &apos;-&apos; &apos;.&apos;     &quot;&apos; -&apos;;     ; 145. First, the contribution records of . rural approved societies, referred to in Appendix A, cover Scottish as.well as English societies and show tinemployment in&apos; both countries at. cornparable levels. These records refer, not to a single date&apos;, but.to.quinquennia.46. Second, the evidence tendered to us from&apos;  he side of the employees by trade unions arid rural approved societies traverses directly the evidence of the employers that there is &quot;no&quot; -or &quot; negligible &quot; unemployment among Scottish agricultural workers. These organisations include directly a small proportion only of ail the workers,, but their representatives speak with a knowledge of agricultural conditions which must be as wide as that of the employers. &apos; &apos; , ;   .47. Third, the returns made by the farmers themselves to the agricultural departments each June, as to the numbers employed by them, show for the two &quot;countries curiously similar proportions of &quot;regular&quot; and &quot; casual.&quot;&apos; workers respectively&apos;. . The returns for 1934 &quot;gave for males 522,400 regulars and 81,600 casuals in England and Wales, 7.7,900 and 10,100 casuals&apos;-&apos; in&apos; Scotland;. the casuals are 13-3 per cent of the whole number in one country and 11-5 per cent, in the other case. i! &apos; 1,48. In citing these statistics it is desirable to point out that most of those who are described in the Agricultural Betlirris as &quot;&quot;casuals &quot; are not by any means mere &quot; hangers-on&quot; upon agriculture. We were informed by the,Ministry of Agriculture&apos;that many&apos; at least of the male workers described as &quot; casual &quot;&apos; are so only in the&apos;sense that they are hot continuously employed by the same farmer. It is estimated that half of thbse male workers, though returned as &apos;&apos; casual&quot; &apos;v are agricultural workers regularly seeking employment and wholly&apos;&quot;dependent upon;&quot;tneir&quot; -agpicolturar.&apos;fearningd for their livelihood. This estimate for England and Wales is based upon the opinions of Inspectors employed under, the Agricultural /Wages (Regulation) Act. In the absence of any similar1&apos; regulation of agricultural wages inScotland, theDepartrhenfbf Agriculture 1 here
has not the same facilities for estimating what proportion of workers returned as &apos;&apos; casual &apos;&apos; are wholly dependent on agricultural earnings. But it is clear that many of them,are employed nearly continuously with one farmer or another, except in the months of winter slackness.49. One comparison after another shows substantial similarity between England and Wales and Scotland, in the broad facts of agricultural employment - and unemployment. The differences between them are minor differences. There is, first, in Scotland a larger proportion of men in the relatively stable occupations con-nected with livestock. This makes the,general level of agricultural unemployment a little, but not much, less. It is also, no doubt, the main reason why the feeling for insurance &quot;among the employees has come later and is less strong in Scotland than elsewhere; unemployment insurance, in. agriculture, as in other industries, means that the more skilled or more fortunate men pay contribu-tions, with less expectation than the rest of drawing benefit. There is, second, the system of yearly or six monthly hirings for regular men. This system is not confined to Scotland and it does not save Scotland from having nearly as high a percentage of agricultural unemployment as the rest of Britain. But the system is prevalent throughout Scotland and we have little doubt that it contributes materially to the attitude of the employers there towards the problem of insurance. It draws the line between &quot; regular &quot; and &quot; casual &quot; more sharply in Scotland than elsewhere, and leads to the &quot; casual &quot; not. being regarded as an agricultural worker at all, though he is essential to the industry and may be employed year after year, from April to October or longer. It means also that, if a yearly man is not re-engaged, he is more likely to go away atto-gether ; the farmer loses sight of him and his possible unemploy-meut; some of those who told us that&quot; there was no agricultural unemployment in Scotland were clearly thinking only of the yearly or half-yearly servant during the period of his contract.50. Whether or not this be the explanation of the attitude taken by the representatives of the Scottish farmers, the facts before us leave no doubt as to the course which we should recommend in regard to Scotland. The facts are largely new facts brought to light in the course of our enquiry. The facts lead us, in our proposals made below, to suggest a reduced rate of contributions on long likings ; this suggestion is not confined to Scotland, but, in view of the prevalence of such hirings there, it means that Scottish agricul-ture will get equal cover against risk of unemployment at a lesser average rate of contribution than English agriculture. The facts make it impossible for us to propose either the exclusion of Scotland from an agricultural scheme of insurance or its inclusion on terms different from the rest of Great Britain.51. In respect of attitude towards.unemployment insurance, there has been marked and general change among agricultural employees,
from opposition to support, since the general scheme of insurance was established in 1920. This change has followed partly on the growth of unemployment, partly on better understanding of what is meant by insurance. The change extends now, if still less generally, to Scotland. Among employers there has been some but not an equal change of attitude. This difference is natural; for the employer, insurance, in agriculture as elsewhere, means contribu-tions not benefits. He may hope to gain indirectly by getting better or more contented workers; in the main he is asked to contribute in the interests of his men and of his industry. This is a consideration with at least as much weight in agriculture as elsewhere for agriculture is marked by special closeness of fellow-feeling between employers and employed; we had evidence of this, when one of those who appeared before us as the chosen representa-tive of workers to urge insurance upon us was himself a farmer. If, after considering our proposals and report, His Majesty&apos;s G-overn-ment and Farliament decide to proceed with unemployment insur-ance in agriculture, we believe, that there will be general acceptance of this decision by employers as well as by employees.52. We may fitly conclude this section by quoting a Report prepared by the Standing Committee of the Council of Agriculture for England, which was adopted by the Council on 13th December, 1934, and sent to us at their request. The Council is a statutory body set up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Act, 1919, to consider and discuss questions of agricultural importance. -Membership is of two kinds resting (1) on appointment by County Agricultural Committees, of two members for each County in England; and (2) on nomination by the Minister of Agriculture of about forty persons chosen to represent equally the three classes of landowners, tenants and workers.The Report is as follows : &quot; The Standing Committee has reported to the Council on one or two occasions in previous years in favour of agricultural workers being brought into benefit under the statutory unem-ployment insurance provisions. It is of interest in this con-nection that in recent months the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee has taken evidence on the subject with a view to the preparation of a scheme to deal with it. The opportunity is therefore present for the Council to reaffirm the view it formerly expressed, namely, that a scheme of unem-ployment insurance for agricultural workers is eminently desirable, and to add that in its opinion the scheme should be self-contained and have special provisions which would meet &apos; the peculiar case of Agriculture. The Standing Committee hopes that the Council, or at any rate the Standing Committee on its behalf, will have an. opportunity of considering the details of any proposed scheme before it is brought into operation.&quot;
53. In the light of the considerations set out above and of the statements submitted to us by the Government Departments con-cerned, and all the other bodies that have appeared before us, we submit, as practicable proposals for insurance against unemployment in agriculture, the outline scheme set out below in Part II of this Report. It provides for agriculture a scheme of insurance which, in the words of the Resolution of the Council of Agriculture, appears to us to be self-contained and with adequate special provisions to meet the peculiar case of Agriculture. We follow this scheme by comments in Part III.In submitting these proposals, we should point out that they rest on certain assumptions as to the nature and purpose of com-pulsory insurance against unemployment which we have not felt called on to discuss and on which, if we did discuss them, we might find ourselves holding differing opinions. There is, for instance, the assumption that it is reasonable to&apos;make the three parties the employee, the employer and the State contribute in equal pro-portions for the provision of an unemployment benefit to be enjoyed directly by one of them. There is the assumption that it is reason-able to make all employees contribute again on substantially equal terms irrespective of their individual risk of unemployment. There is the assumption that the benefit should be a payment claimable as of right and unaffected in amount either by the special needs or by any special resources of the applicant. A uniform payment of this kind (though it may make allowance for such obvious differences between needs as arise from greater or smaller family responsibilities) can not be put forward as representing an estimate of what is actually required as a complete cover against loss of income through unemployment. The existing scheme of unemployment insurance is not based on an estimate of needs but upon practical consideration of how large a contribution it is feasible to require on roughly equal terms from all employees and employers 9,nd of what is the best use that can be made of such resources in contributing to the maintenance of those out of employment. It is on this basis that we make our proposals for the extension of insurance to agriculture and not on the basis of saying, for instance, \hat the benefits we propose are in all cases adequate for the full maintenance of those who will receive them, if they have no oilier &quot;-^sources.PART II. PROPOSALS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IN. AGRICULTURE.(1) Relation of Insurance in Agriculture to Insurance in other indu stries.54. Agricultural workers are at present excluded from insurance against unemployment by the exception in Part II of the First Schedule to the Act of 1920 of &quot; employment in agriculture, in-cluding horticulture and forestry &quot;.   It would not in our opinion
be a practicable proposal s; triply to repeal this exception and so bring the workers now excluded thereby into the general scheme of insurance, at the same rate of contributions and benefits and subject to the same conditions as other employed persons. The wages and conditions of employment in agriculture are so different from those of most other industries as to rule out this suggestion. For men with families, the weekly rates of benefit under the general scheme would often approach or exceed the money wages earned in a full week of agricultural employment. The present contribution of lOd. a week each from an adult workman and his employer would be felt as an excessive burden. There are, as we shall suggest below, other features of the general scheme ill-suited to agriculture. A proposal to bring agricultural workers into insurance on exactly the same terms as all other workers would encounter the almost unanimous hostility of employers and employees. Some difference of treatment between agriculture and the present insured industries is indispensable.55. On the other hand, the widespread and growing demand for insurance among agricultural employees and the growing acquiescence in this demand which we have found amongst their employers, rest, in part at least, on the feeling that exclusion from insurance is an unfair discrimination against the agricultural worker. As it was put to us on behalf of the Central [Landowners&apos; Association &quot; agricultural labour as a highly skilled occupation should not be placed in an inferior position as compared with other industries already provided with unemployment insurance, par-ticularly if it results in preventing youths from taking up agricultural work after leaving school &quot;. As it was put to us on behalf of the Federation of Rural Approved Societies, &quot; the information collected by the Federation indicates that there is definite resentment on the part of agricultural workers at what is regarded as an inferiority of status in this matter. The Federation submits that this psychological factor should not be ignored &quot;.56. In our proposals, accordingly, we proceed on two main prin-ciples : first, that agricultural workers cannot be put direct into the general scheme ; second, that insurance in agriculture should not differ from insurance in other industries except for good reason.57. The first main difference between agriculture and other-industries is that already stated that the general level of money wages is lower in agriculture than elsewhere. When account is taken of the terms of agricultural employment, in respect of cheaper cottages, of supplies in kind and of supplementary earnings, the real difference of living conditions is not very great. But the difference is sufficient to make it equitable to propose for agricultural workers a rate of unemployment benefit lower than that of other workers.58. A second main difference between agriculture and other industries is that unemployment, though it is substantial in agri-culture, is still materially less than in the insured industries taken as a whole.
59. Yet a third difference is the historical one that during the past fourteen years, in which other industries have been insured against unemployment, agriculture has not been insured. Insurance of the other industries has involved accumulation of a. debt of over  100,000,000 ; to pay interest on this debt and, in due course, repay the capital, a charge of  5,000,000 a year, representing about 2Jd. out of the joint weekly contribution of 2s. 6d. for an adult male, has been imposed on the other industries. Workers in agriculture have not drawn any of the benefits represented by this debt.60. We propose that in coming into insurance against unemploy. ment, agricultural workers, their employers and the State, shall pay only such contributions as are required to provide the lower agricultural benefit, on the basis of the lower agricultural unem-ployment, and without liability for the existing debt of the Unemployment Fund.61. The conclusive practical reason for taking this course is that to take the opposite course and include agriculture in the general scheme at a rate of contributions strictly proportionate to the lower rate of benefit, would be to relieve other industries at the expense of agriculture. At present, under the general scheme, the work-man pays lOd. a week for benefit, which yields for man, wife and two children a weekly payment of 80s. when he is unemployed. A simple proportionate reduction (say) by one-fifth of benefits and of contributions alike would mean that the agricultural worker with the same family, paid 8d. a week for a benefit of. 24s. a week. But, according to the actuarial calculations, all that is needed to provide such a benefit, under the conditions that we suggest below, is a contribution of 4d. a week from each of the three parties. If we now brought agriculture into the insurance scheme at a lower rate of benefit and a strictly proportionate contribution, one-half of the agricultural contributions would go to lighten the burden upon other industries. Such a proposal would convert the present general support for insurance among agricultural workers into general hostility.62. We propose accordingly that the agricultural scheme of unemployment insurance shall be self-contained in finance. We recognise that this means giving to agriculture special treatment which is not accorded to other industries of low unemployment. Included in the general scheme are a number of industries with unemployment about as low as that now assumed for agriculture or even lower; these pay materially more in contributions than they draw in benefits, and are compelled to pay for the unemployment of other industries. This may well be justified on the ground that all the industries are necessary to one another, that, for instance, the distributive trades or road transport with their present low unemployment would have no work to do if there were no pro-ductive trades. But much the same might be said of agriculture. It. does not and cannot stand apart from manufacturing or trade.
The prosperity of agriculture is related to the prosperity of other industries. Agriculture draws upon the pool of labour in other industries for its seasonal and casual needs. Those who lose employment in. agriculture often go to swell the ranks of those employed or unemployed in the towns.63. While, therefore, we feel bound to accord special treatment to agriculture in some respects, we are bound also to point out that it is special treatment. We are led to reject a proposal for yet further special treatment which was put before us.64. Under the general scheme, at the present time, employer, workman, and the State contribute equal thirds to the total cost. The majority of the Inter-Departmental Committee who advocated agricultural unemployment insurance in 1926, proposed that the cost should be distributed differently- that the employer and the workman should each pay one-quarter and the State one-half. A similar suggestion was made to us by some of. the workers&apos; organi-sations. It is not necessary for us to express any opinion on the existing equal division of contributions as between the three parties to the general scheme of insurance; we are bound to accept that as laid down by Parliament. &apos; Accepting it, we see no reason for applying to agriculture any different principle..65. Our proposal to keep agricultural contributions for agri-cultural expenditure means that for the agricultural scheme of insurance there will be separate accounts, and a periodical review of income and expenditure, leading where necessary to separate revision of agricultural contributions and benefits. It does not mean the setting up of an unemployment fund for agriculture which is legally distinct from the general unemployment fund. For several reasons the setting up of such a legally separate fund is undesirable.66. In the first place, as is pointed out under the head of Transfers,&quot; there will always be numbers of men who work sometimes in agriculture and sometimes in other industries and should receive benefit sometimes under the general scheme and sometimes under the agricultural scheme. We are satisfied, that arrangements can be made, either in the way we suggest below or in some other way that experience may prove better, to do substantial justice in each case to the men concerned. It will also be possible with separate accounting, to allocate the cost of such benefits, with substantial justice, as between the agriculture and the general accounts. To go beyond this, and establish legally separate funds for the general scheme and for agriculture, may cause complications in the determination of -legal liability and involve meticulous decisions and administrative labour out of all proportion to the results to be achieved. There will be need for similar allocation by estimate of the liability for costs of adminis-tration as between agriculture and the other industries.
67. In the second place, if the funds are legally separafft temporary exhaustion of either will involve recourse &quot;to&quot; the, borrow-ing powers under the Act of 1934; this recourse will be&apos;subject to alt the conditions prescribed for borrowing. In a single fund with separate accounts, a temporary deficiency on one account may often be met from the other account, as a matter of internal arrangement without recourse to&quot; outside borrowing. There must be safeguards to secure that money advanced from one account to the other is repaid, by revision of contribirtions or benefits, if necessary, interest should be charged on it at a reasonable rate for the benefit of the lending account. This may well prove advantageous to both accounts.(2) Scope of Insurance.68. Subject to a few limited exceptions, the scope of the agri-cultural insurance scheme should be the same as that of the present exception-that is to say, the scheme should cover agriculture, horticulture and forestry. The defining of the borders of the agri-cultural scheme on this geiieral principle is in accordance with our terms of reference and&apos;has- administrative advantage. It will be possible to use the experience gained in marking off of agriculture for exclusion from insurance in the past, for the future purpose of determining liability for special contributions.69. There are five special problems relating to the scope of insurance in agriculture which; call for notice here. They may be described as the problems of the Family Farm, the Piece Work Contractor, the Special Seasonal&apos;&apos; Worker, the Irish Migratory Labourer, and the Private Gardener. These are dealt with in turn below. There are two other special problems which, though to some extent questions of scope, have been dealt with prac-^-ally under a different head. They may be described as the problem of the Resident Casual and the problem of the Smallholder or Crofter. They are reserved for the section on conditions and Period of Benefit.The Family Farm.70. Under the existing general scheme, unemployment insurance does not apply to the employment of the husband or wife of the employer or the unpaid employment of his child. In agriculture, joint family enterprises are a, larger element than in other industries. We propose, in the Agricultural scheme, to exclude the employment, whether paid or unpaid, of a wife or husband, a son or son&apos;s wife, a -daughter or daughters husband, a father or mother of the em-.ployer. Such persons are not normally under a contract of service. Most of them, if they were held to be under contract of service, would pay contributions with no chance of getting benefit; alterna-tively,&apos; there would be risk: that any claim made by them would be of a collusive character.: Though&quot; this&apos;p.f6bldm has been described as that of the Family Farm,;it arises hot only Hyhere all or nearly all the
work is done by the farmer and his relatives, but also where both relative and outside hired labourers are engaged regularly or occa-provisionally. The ,only doubt was to the working of dur proposed exception is whether it should apply where the excluding relation-ship supervenes after a substantial period of insurable employment. Should an agricultural employee whohad-been insured for a number of years -be excluded from insurance because he marries his em-ployer&apos;s daughter, or in the&apos; case of a woman because she marries her employer&apos;s son?&quot; We suggest that power should be given to the Minister by regulation to permit the continuance of insurance in such cases.The Piece-work Contractor.71. There are certain types of agricultural work, in particular such operation as thatching or hedging and ditching, which are often undertaken under arrangements leaving it doubtful whether the contract is legally a contract of service paid for by piece-work wages., or a contract for services, to be performed independently and not under the control of the employer. The practical difficulty of draw-ing the line between the two types of contracts is considerable, and for purposes of health insurance the distinction has been abolished by an order bringing into insurance the performance of such work whether under contract for services or contract of service.72. The.treatment of these workers for the purposes of unemploy-ment insurance presents greater difficulties than in the,case.of health insurance. If, for instance, a man agrees to put the hedges and ditches on a farm in order during the next two months, there.is not merely the problem of determining the exact period for which contri-butions should be paid, but also of determining whether and for how long he is unemployed when he makes a claim. This is a.minor problem which must&quot;clearly be dealt with.by regulations. We sug-gest that powers be given to .the Minister, if he thinks fit,.to bring into unemployment insurance persons working under contract for services, but to require in their case a special form of claim and special proof of unemployment.The -Special -Seasonal Worker.73. -We propose to apply,to unemployment insurance in agricul-ture, the provisions how in force for-health insurance under the Subsidiary Employments Order of 1932,&apos; and to except from insur-ance. accordingly &quot; employment in -harvesting or gathering of fruits, or flowers, peas or &quot;potatoes, or tying, training or picking of-hops, or in the peeling of onions&quot;, -unless the person so employed is at the time of entry on the employment already-insured against unem-ployment. This wilLmeah, in practice,:that,-if a person already insured against unemployment takes this seasonal work, -he will present to his employer, his unemployment book as well as his.health insurance caird for stamping V On the other -hand, persons who. take this seasonal work, but during the rest of the.year are hot normally
22 ljseeking employment (married women and children, smallholders, etc.) will not have unemployment books to ^present and will be excluded. This is the procedure now in force for health insurance. There are obvious advantages in. keeping in line with it. It will prevent payment of contributions by persons who either will have no chance of getting benefit or, if they qualify for benefit,&apos; are likely to draw the maximum amount year after year and thus drain the fund. The Subsidiary Employments Order, it will be seen, applies only to named seasonal work, of a type mainly undertaken for short periods by persons who do not normally live by insurable employ-ment. It does not apply to work such as that on sugar beet or in turnip thinning which requires special strength or skill, or to seasonal or casual works generally.The Irish Migratory Labourer.74. Considerable numbers of labourers ordinarily resident in Ireland come to Great Britain year after year for seasonal work; some or those, moving from place to place and one operation to another, may in some years spend as much as six months in this country.75. Under section 81 (3) of the National Insurance Act of 1911 such persons could be exempted from health insurance ; this meant that the employer paid his own contribution but that no contribu-tions were paid by the labourers and no right to health benefit was acquired by them. The exemption extended to any person employed in harvesting or other agricultural work who proved (a) that he was an Irish migratory labourer, that is to say, a person who, having a permanent home at some place in Ireland, had temporarily removed to some other place in Ireland or to Great Britain for the purpose of obtaining such employment; and (b) that he ordinarily resided at such permanent home for not less than twenty-six weeks in the year and was not employed within the meaning of the Act whilst so resident.This provision of the National Insurance Act of 1911 has ceased to operate, as health insurance now applies to practically all such labourers when they are in Ireland as much as when they are in Britain. Unemployment insurance, however, does not now apply to agriculture in Ireland and unless and until it does apply we suggest that the principle of the section cited above from the Act of 1911 should be adopted ; that is to say, persons ordinarily resident in Ireland (or elsewhere outside Great Britain) and not insured in their own countries against unemployment should- be able to claim exemption from the agricultural scheme. They ought not to be excepted ; contributions should be required from the employer, so as to avoid putting a premium on the employment of such labourers. They ought to be exempted, contributions should not be required from the labourers; it is undesirable that they should either be required to pay without any chance of drawing benefit or be tempted
to stay in Britain in order to draw benefit when it is practically certain that otherwise they would have returned to their own. country.76. It does not follow that all who were qualified for exemption would claim exemption. Some or many might think it worth while to pay contributions wth a view to staying on in Britain to draw benefit. To deal with this point involves anticipating to some extent our proposals on Conditions and Period of Benefit. Under those proposals the benefit that could be drawn by these labourers, would in any case be limited by the ratio rule. If that limitation proved insufficient to prevent excessive drains on. the unemployment fund, it might be necessary to consider further measures. Several different plans can be suggested.77. The most direct way of dealing with the problem would be to say that the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation under the Anomalies Act which, for reasons stated below, we regard as unsuitable for the agricultural scheme generally, should.nevertheless apply in this particular case. That is to say, the Regulation should apply to people who, by reason of their ordinary residence in; a country without agricultural unemployment insurance were qualified for the exemption we propose above. It has been pointed out to us that such a provision might be criticised as contravening in spirit, if not hi! letter; international conventions as to the treatment in labour legislation of immigrants from other countries. We are not satisfied that this criticism would be sound, since our proposal turns not on nationality but on residence under conditions making unemployment insurance anomalous. The ordinary objection to the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation that it allows contributions to be required when there is little or no chance of benefit would not apply here since the men concerned could claim exemption. But if, for any reason, this direct way of dealing with the problem were rejected, other ways not subject to the same criticism would still be open.78. One such way would be to lengthen slightly the existing general provision under the Unemployment Insurance Act for exemption of persons working in. a seasonal occupation not more than 18 weeks in. the year. It might, for instance, be provided that, for the purpose of the agricultural scheme, the number of weeks should be raised from 18 to 24, and then that any person qualified to claim exemption should be subject to the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation.79. We have made these various suggestions to show the variety of methods open for dealing with minor problems under the unemployment insurance scheme. In making them at this length, we wish to avoid exaggerating this particiilar danger; nor do we wish to suggest that it is unreasonable that a workman doing seasonal work should obtain some insurance against unemployment by such work. It is desirable, however, to prevent him, if possible,
from getting benefit for periods in which it is practically certain that, but for that benefit, he would riot have stayed in this country, or sought employment here.The Private Gardener, etc.80. Our proposals will bring into unemployment insurance under special conditions one of the principal groups of employees who are now excepted-those engaged in agriculture, horticulture and forestry. There will remain outside insurance those subject to the other principal exception- the persons employed in private domestic service. This will bring into prominence a question which has hitherto been left somewhat obscure, namely, the position of those engaged in gardening operations. Persons so employed may be in any one of three classes; they may be working for a private employer; they may be working for a nurseryman, that is to say, a person whose business is horticulture; they may be working in a business carried on for gain, such as the manage-ment of a hotel, which is not itself horticulture.81. The great bulk of gardeners are in one or other of the first two classes and as such have been unquestionably outside the scope of unemployment insurance, without its being necessary to decide whether they were excluded by the exception of private domestic service or by the exception of agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. If it is proposed to replace the latter exception by legislation bringing into a separate scheme of insurance persons engaged in agriculture (including horticulture and forestry), it will at once become a practical question of considerable importance, whether gardeners in private employ are to be treated as private domestic servants and still excluded, or whether they, along with all other gardeners irrespective of the nature of their employees business, are to be treated as engaged in horticulture, and so included in the agricultural scheme.82. The legal position in the past has been somewhat obscure. But as our proposals can only be carried out by legislation, it will be possible, in that legislation, to determine the position of gardeners,&apos; in whatever way seems best. With this in view we make the proposal : (1) that all gardening operations, whether in private employ or in the service of a nurseryman or in the service of a business such as a hotel, should be treated as &quot; horticulture &quot; and thus brought generally within the agricultural scheme, but (2) that horticulture in a private garden should be specifically excluded unless and until the Minister by regulations shall other-wise determine.83. The first part of this proposal is in accordance with the interpretation provision in Section 47 of the Unemployment Insur-ance Act of 1920. This lays it down that &quot; in determining any question as to whether any occupation in which a person is or has been engaged is or was such as to make him an employed person
25 9wwithin the meaning of. this Act regard shall be had to the. nature of the work on which he is or was engaged rather than to the business of the person by whom he is or was employed.&quot; If, in spite of this provision, there remains doubt whether all gardening operations, wherever conducted, are &quot;horticulture&quot; this should be secured by appropriate definitions in any legislation introduced to give effect to Our proposals.84. The second part of the proposal is added, because it seems to us that the treatment of private gardeners for purposes of insurance is a matter upon which further investigation and perhaps further experience of the working of an agricultural scheme of insurance are necessary. To adopt the first part only without the second and thus bring all private gardeners at once into the agri-cultural scheme would mean extending unemployment insurance to a large class of employers whom hitherto it has not concerned, that is to say, all the-private householders who happen to employ gardeners. It would mean that the private gardener was insured while the private chauffeur was not, and it would lead to difficult problems with those who were partly gardeners and partly chauffeurs or indoor servants. We are not able to conclude that such an extension of unemployment insurance &quot;is desirable. Certainly it should not be made without much fuller enquiry than we have,been able to make.85. On the other hand, it may prove that gardeners move so frequently between private employ and business employ, or that private gardeners, in respect of their risk of unemployment, are so much closer to other gardeners than to private domestic servants, as to make it desirable to insure them. We suggest that the Minister should be given power to bring that about by Regulations. If the Minister were to prepare draft Regulations for that purpose, the Regulations would, presumably, be referred to us and discussed with the parties interested before any action was taken.86. In accordance with our suggestions above, in framing our proposals, we have treated private gardeners as outside the agri-cultural scheme of -insurance. They form a numerous body at least 125,000 so that the question of their inclusion or exclusion is important. But so far as we can judge from the census returns, their general level of unemployment is a little below that which we have assumed for our scheme as a whole. Their subsequent inclusion, if it were decided on, could be undertaken without weakening the finance of the scheme.87. The five problems named above that of the Family Farm, the Piecework Contractor, the Special Seasonal Workers, the Irish Migratory Labourer, and the Private Gardener are not in essence new problems. They can all be dealt with by adaptations or extensions of principles already in force for adjusting the boundaries of insurance, either for health or for unemployment : they can be solved by exception (that is to&apos; say complete exclusion
of a particular class fot all contributions and benefits), by exemption (that is to say exemption of the employee alone from contribution with loss of insurance rights, while contributions are still required from the employer) or by specific inclusion by order of persons falling technically outside the definition of insurance but substantially within it. The problem of the Irish Migratory Labourer may prove an exception to this statement and call for further measures. The problems of the Resident Casual and the Smallholder or Crofter undoubtedly do so&apos;.(3) Rates of Contribution and Benefit.88. For the reasons stated above and set out at length in Appendix A, we have asked the Government Actuary to base his calculations on an unemployment rate of 7-5 per cent, in agricul-ture as a whole. We may and do hope that, as prosperity returns to the world in general or to British agriculture in particular, the unemployment experienced over a period of years will be less than this percentage. But this is a matter for hope rather than for reasoned expectation. We cannot frame an insurance scheme upon hope.89. Given the rate of unemployment, the three main variables affecting the finance of an insurance scheme are the rate of benefit, the rate of contribution, and the rules which define the period of benefit and so determine what proportion of the total unemploy-ment ranks for benefit. These three variables are related. Snb-ject to not making unemployment as attractive as employment, or more so, it is desirable to make the benefits as full a cover as possible for all genuine unemployment, but the possibility is limited by consideration of the contributions required. For any given rate of contribution, the higher the weekly rate of benefit, the shorter &apos; is the period for which it can be paid and the smaller the propor-tion of total unemployment that can rank for benefit; conversely, the longer the period of benefit, the lower must the weekly rate of benefit be fixed.90. Of these three variables, it is convenient to consider first the weekly rate of benefit. In that consideration, we have had regard, on the one hand, to the rates of benefit under the general scheme of insurance, and on the other hand to the scale of assistance which has just been approved under Part II of the Unemployment Act. Our function, indeed, is not like that of the Unemployment Assist-ance Board, to assess physical needs. Our problem is primarily the actuarial one of saying what rate of contribution will produce a given rate of benefit and for what period. As we have stated above in paragraph 53 any benefits proposed by us are not to be taken as representing in our viow complete maintenance without other resources. But we cannot ignore Part II of the Unemploy-ment Act. It would not, in our view, be a practicable proposal for unemployment insurance in agriculture, to suggest a rate of benefit
so low as to make it likely that practically all agricultural workers, as soon as they were unemployed, would have recourse to unemploy-ment assistance in supplement of benefit.91. Under the general scheme of insurance the weekly rate of benefit is now 17s. for an adult male, 9s. for a wife or other adult dependant, and 2s. for each dependant child, yielding 30s. a week for a family of man, wife and two children. If we regarded our-selves as bound by the precedent of the general scheme to suggest a scale of benefits for the agricultural scheme which did not exceed the scale of the general scheme, at any single point, then we would propose in the agricultural scheme at the outset a benefit of 12s. for an adult male, of 6s. 6d. for a wife or other adult de-pendant, and 2s. for each dependant child, yielding 22s. 6d. a week for a family of man, wife and two children. If we regarded our-selves as free to depart from this precedent, then we would pro-: pose at the outset a benefit of 12s. for an adult male, 6s. 6d. for a wife or other adult dependant, 3s. for the first dependant child and 2s. 6d. for each of the other children, yielding for a family of man, wife and two children an income of 24s. a week. In each case we propose that the payment to any one claimant should be subject to a maximum of 30s. a week. We propose for an adult female a weekly benefit of 10s. 6d. and a graded scale of benefits for young persons and juveniles, following as closely as possible the analogy of the general scheme.92. The alternative scales, as will be seen, differ only in the benefit provided for dependant children and the resulting differ-ence in total cost of benefits is relatively small, amounting. to  35,000. As will be seen from the later section on the finance of the scheme and from the report of the Government Actuary, either scale would be covered by the contributions proposed below. The lower scale would leave an estimated surplus in the fund of  70,000 in the first year ; the higher scale would leave a surplus of  35,000. Either plan, therefore, is financially possible, on the contributions that we propose ; the choice between them depends essentially upon the relative degrees of importance attached, on the one hand, to following the precedent of the general scheme, and on the other hand, to approaching as near as possible to the total of the assist-ance scale. If the lower of the two benefit scales named above were adopted at the outset for the agricultural scheme, and there-after it were decided to improve the children&apos;s benefit under the general scheme, we should regard it as reasonable to&apos; make a corre-spqnding improvement in the children&apos;s benefit of the agricultural scheme. With that possibility in view, we should keep the surplus of  70,000 available to meet that change.93. We cannot at this stage forecast in any way whatever, the financial condition of the general unemployment fund or the action that it may be possible or desirable for us to recommend with regard to that at a later stage.   There is, however, at least the possibility
of an increase of children&apos;s benefit,generally, which would make a new precedent. With this in mind and in&apos;view of orir uncertainty as to how far the existing precedent should guide us, it appears convenient to present iii the rest of our report the second scale with the higher childreriV benefit, while making it clear that we regard the immediate choice between&apos; the two scales as a matter to be judged by others rather than by ourselves, having regard to the opinions of all those who. are interested either ih the general scheme or in the agricultural scheme.94. As the normal rate of contribution for adult males we pro-pose Is. a week, divided, as in the general scheme, equally between the three parties, that; is to say, 4d. a week each from employer, employee and the State. We propose a graded scale of lower contributions for women and young persons, following the analogy of the general scheme.95&apos;. At the rate of unemployment deduced above, namely 7-5 per cent., and with the benefits proposed, this contribution makes it possible to cover nearly 60 per cent, of the total unemployment in agriculture. This is much the same proportion as is being covered by insurance in the industries with least unemployment under the general scheme; in the depressed industries, under the general scheme, the proportion is naturally less. . Part of the unemploy-ment in agriculture not covered by benefit under our proposals is represented by the &apos;&apos; waiting week &apos;&apos; and various disqualifications. To what extent the remainder of the 7-5 per cent, represents tin-employment fairly chargeable to an agricultureal scheme, and to What extent it. represents unemployment of men only partially connected with agriculture, it is impossible now to say. It may well prove desirable, in future to aim at covering by insurance a larger proportion of the total un-employment in agriculture as elsewhere. At the rate of tin-employment which in prudence we are compelled to assume, this would mean raising the joint contribution above Is. a week. The far higher contributions of the general scheme are now being exacted from many industrial workers with earnings not materially above those of skilled agriculturists and ih industries more depressed than agriculture. But, with a view to securing general acceptance of insurance in agriculture, we feel that imposition of a joint con-tribution in excess of Is., a week&apos;should be avoided; there is always the hope that agricultural unemployment in future may prove less than in the past six or seven years, and allow an improvement of benefits on the contributions proposed.96. The scale of benefit and contribution which we suggest are set out in tabular form below, with the rates under the general scheme for comparison.It may be of interest to note that the scheme put before us on behalf of the agricultural trade unions proposed a joint contribii-tion of Is. a week for adult males, and a scale of benefits yielding

(as,corn-pared with. 24s. under ..our scale) arid,, for man, wife and. four children, of 29s. (which is the same as under our scale). The totals, both of contributions and benefits&apos; are thus very near to our proposals. The composition of the,&apos;totals in each case is different. In respect ,of contributions the trade unions proposed a larger proportion from the State. In&apos; respect of benefits they proposed a higher personal rate for the workers and lower rates for dependants, whether adults or children.-Weekly rates of Benefit.Males. Females.General.

Under the general scheme, the right to unemployment benefit is defined by a series of statutory conditions and disqualifications ; most of these are,common to all insured persons, but some, under the Anomalies Act, affect certain classes only, in particular, married women and seasonal workers. Most of these conditions and dis-qualifications can be applied without difficulty to the agricultural scheme, and, oh the principle of not making unnecessary distinction between agriculture and other industries, we propose to apply them. There are two sets of conditions in the general scheme which appear unsuitable for the agricultural scheme. These relate to the period of benefit to which specified contributions may give a claim, and to the Seasonal. Workers. Regulation under the Anornalies. Act.. In each case difficulty arises from the special conditions of agricultural employment.98. As was pointed out in a Memorandum submitted to us by the Ministry of Labour and the two agricultural departments, there are a large number of people living in rural districts who take
occasional spells of employment in agriculture, but do not depend on!.such employment for their livelihood during the year. This, generically, is the problem of the Resident Casual, so described to distinguish him from the Irish Migratory.Labourer and from the occasional or seasonal visitor from the towns, who comes under the Subsidiary Employments Order. He must be distinguished also from the man who though described as &quot; casual &quot; in the Agri-cultural Returns, works regularly whenever he can, for one em-ployer or another, and depends almost wholly on his agricultural earnings.99. The largest single class of these residents available for partial employment are the small-holders and crofters who work sometimes on their own account and sometimes as employees. The propor-tions in which they divide their time between the two ways of getting a livelihood are infinitely various and the employment wlrch they take may come at many different seasons. From the point of view of unemployment insurance there are one or two distinctive features about them which make it appropriate to speak of the problem of the Small-holder or Chofter. For most purposes they merge into the. larger class of the Resident Casual which includes not only them but many others : people picking up a living by an immense variety of alternative occupations, some insured but very irregular, like fishing or casual work on the roads, others un-insured; naval and military pensioners; married women; men mainly supported by their families, and other types. If all these casuals are allowed to contribute and draw benefit under the rules of the general scheme of 30 contributions in two years giving a title to 26. weeks&apos; benefit, renewable for another 26 weeks by ten more contributions and so on they may swamp the agricultural scheme and exhaust its funds. Ten contributions can be gained by ten days of work in different weeks.More than one of those who advocated insurance before us pointed out the danger to insurance from these casual workers and made suggestions for meeting it. The representatives of the Rural Approved Societies proposed that the number of contributions re-quired as a qualification for benefit should be higher than in the general scheme; they suggested requiring 26 contributions in each year. Practically the same condition was named in the statement of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, as having been proposed by the agricultural trade unions to the Ministry of Labour in 1930. In oral evidence before us, the representatives of this union referred particularly to the problem of the small-holders and the danger that some of them presented to an insurance scheme; they suggested excluding from insurance all with holdings of five acres or more, even if they sometimes worked for wages. The Central Landowners&apos; Association wished to confine insurance to workers regularly employed under the terms of the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act.
100. 6ther witnesses treated the danger to the fund from casual workers as the principal argument against attempting insurance at all.&quot; The first and most considerable difficulty in applying a special scheme to agriculture is . . . to define an agricultural worker for the purpose of the scheme. If all casual and seasonal workers were included in a scheme their claims on the fund would be insupportable. If the criterion taken is that the worker is mainly dependent upon this agricultural work, a number of workers who are not normally engaged in agriculture all the year round and would not be prepared to take regular work would be included, and the difficulty of determining which workers came under this heading would be very great and entail expensive administrative machinery. If, as seems de-undesirable, the agricultural scheme is confined to regular workers in agriculture, there is the difficulty of defining what period of work entitles a worker to be classed as a regular worker and there is a danger of excluding those for whose benefit the scheme is mainly designed, that is to say, those workers who were regular workers, but owing to the depression in agri-culture, have not been able to obtain regular agricultural work recently.&quot;The difficulty could hardly be put more fairly or more concisely than it is in these words from the statement put before us by the National Farmers Union. To make it clear that the contributions of those who are genuinely seeking to live by agricultural employ-ment will go to give them help when needed and will not be swallowed up by the &quot; hangers-on &quot; of the industry, would do more than anything else to remove opposition to insurance, among farmers as among men.101. The difficulty cannot be dealt with as a matter of scope, either by exception or by exemption. It would be most un-desirable to put a premium on the employment of any class of casuals (whether large small-holders or others) in place of regular men, by excepting them and so relieving the employer of con-tributions. If they were merely exempted, i.e.. freed from their contributions while the employees liability remained, they would have no interest in seeing that contributions were paid and en-forcement would fail. Nor is it easy to see how they could be forcibly exempted if they wished to contribute and qualify for benefit. At the contribution paying .stage, it is impracticable to distinguish between these men and other agricultural workers or to enforce a distinction if it is attempted. Exception and exemption alike should be confined to limited and well-defined classes.102. The difficulty must be dealt with at the benefit end of the scheme. The proposal to require 26 contributions a year, as the qualification for getting any benefit at all, is an attempt on these
lines. It replaces the first statutory condition of the general scheme by the same kind of condition at a different level; it defines the insurable field by a fence which is higher but equally rigid. The objection to this is that it might cut out the regular agricultural labourer who had been unfortunate for a year or two, while it would leave untouched the small-holder who worked one day a week for half of each year. Another objection is that, in so far as the contribution condition was effective in depriving casual workers of all chance of benefit, it would deprive them also of any interest in getting insured; the difficulty named above, of enforcing employers&apos; contributions under conditions of exemption, would apply with double force.103. These considerations point to the necessity of defining con-tribution-eligibility and period of benefit under the agricultural scheme, in a way different from that of the general scheme. It does not meet the case to replace the first statutory condition of the general scheme by a higher fence of the same rigid character. Some-thing more flexible is needed, which will let in easily the man who depends wholly or mainly on agricultural employment, and will limit the claim of the partial worker, by giving him something rather than nothing. There is no serious difficulty in securing this, by applying and extending a ratio principle already in the general scheme under the Act of 1934. But before coming to positive suggestions, it will foe convenient to consider the other question named above, that of the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation.104. This Regulation is intended to prevent benefit from being drawn for long periods, year after year, by persons employed in occupations in which at certain seasons there is practically no chance of their finding employment. The typical case which, perhaps more than most, led to the introduction of the Regulation is that of persons employed in fishing, in which for a considerable proportion of the year&apos; there is practically no employment at all in some districts. But the Regulaion does not apply only to such cases. In considering whether a person&apos;s normal occupation is of a seasonal nature, the Umpire has laid it down that &quot; you must not consider the occupation in which he is employed generic-ally, but you must consider whether the particular occupation which he follows is of a seasonal nature, and it is none the less so because other people follow it permanently and not seasonally &quot;. In some decisions the Umpire appears to have reached the point of making the Regulation apply not to occupations in the ordinary sense, but almost to particular operations.105. It is not possible to say in advance how the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation would work out in relation to agriculture. But it seems likely that the effect would be drastic. It would no doubt cut out many of the casual workers but by no means all of them since they may be called on at different seasons of the year.   On the other hand, in its present form it would equally
deprive of any chance of benefit large numbers of men who look to agricultural employment, particularly in arable farming, for their livelihood. To attempt to defend the agricultural fund against ex-sucessive claims by means of the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation is open to the same objection as is the attempt to-defend the fund by a high contribution condition for benefit. It would exclude many of those who ought to benefit, while still giving too much to casuals. The strict appliance of, this Regulation might go far to negative the purposes of insurance. It would certainly leave a sense of grievance, if men working and paying contributions normally for seven or eight months in&apos; each year got nothing for their con-tributions.106. In respect of seasons, agriculture stands on a different footing both from fishing and from&apos; all other industries. Agriculture as a whole continues throughout the year, but practically all operations in it go with the seasons. Seasonal variation of work is of the essence of agriculture, and the strict application to this industry of the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation can hardly fail to produce an indefensible situation.107. The special conditions of agricultural employment make both the Anomalies Act-of its seasonal side and-the ordinary contribution qualification for period of benefit unsuitable. We propose&apos; that both these provisions should be replaced by a plan of defining the period of benefit, by relation to the contributions paid and exhausted.108. The actual rule that we suggest is as follows : In order to begin a benefit year, a contributor must have not less than ten unexhausted contributions, the period of benefit payable in the benefit year will be defined as two weeks of benefit for the first ten unexhausted contributions, and one further week of benefit for each two unexhausted contributions beyond ten, subject to a maximum of 50 weeks of benefit in any benefit year. When an agricultural worker had exhausted his claim, either under the ratio rule or the 50 weeks maximum, he should not be able to claim again till he had ten fresh contributions ; if he had fallen under the 50 weeks maximum, he might still have earlier unexhausted conributions to his credit and would be able to reckon these, as soon as, by getting ten fresh contributions after his year of idleness, he had proved that he was still in the insurable field. We suggest further that there should be an initial qualifying condition of (say) 20 contributions ; at the outset of the scheme contributions should run for six months before any benefit is paid, so that all regular workers will start in benefit; later all those who enter agriculture as boys and girls will get their qualifying contributions at that stage.109. Though these suggested rules have to be stated at some length, they could, we believe, be applied simply, by the same procedure as that of the general scheme.   The workman making27462 B
a claim would be assessed, as at present, as being qualified for so many days of benefit in the benefit year beginning with the claim. The assessment would be made on a different principle, but the rest of the procedure would he the same : the 50 weeks maximum and ten re-qualifying contributions recall the general scheme.110. The actual working of the ratio rule can be seen from one or two illustrations. It means that a man working on an average 35 weeks (about 8 months) each year could get 14J weeks of benefit; allowing for waiting week and the normal sickness, he would be covered for all his unemployment. It means, again, that a man who had wrorked regularly for two years and six weeks could get benefit for 50 weeks ; if he had worked regularly for four years, he could get benefit for 50 weeks, and as soon as he had 10 re-qualifying contributions he could get another 50 weeks of benefit if he needed them.111. Such a rule, we suggest, affords ample cover for the worker who seeks to live by agriculture. It gives those who work occasion-ally only, a fair return instead of excluding them altogether, but it prevents them from establishing claims destructive of the solvency of the unemployment fund and not justified by their dependence on agricultural employment.112. In these suggestions we have treated the agricultural ratio rule as based on all contributions, whenever paid. Ideally this seems the right principle. It allows men in youth to build up claims against the risk of greater unemployment when they are approach-ing retirement. In the &quot; additional days &quot; provision of the Act of 1934, however, the reckoning of contributions is limited to the past five years. There may be practical reasons for applying a similar time limit in the agricultural ratio rule, though not necessarily a limit as short as five years. It may, for instance, be well to exclude the possibility of a workman, who had left agriculture for some other industry twenty years before, returning to draw agricultural benefit in respect of still earlier contributions. At this stage, it is enough for us to poiiit out that the question of a time limit for past contribu-tions in agriculture cannot become a practical issue for five years at least; many things will have changed by then. All our proposals are experimental: the rules of benefit can, and should, be varied to meet changing conditions in the light of experience.113. With a ratio rule such as we suggest, it would, we hope, be possible both to keep all the other conditions as to benefit, including the waiting week and continuity rules, and to dispense with the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation under the Anomalies Act. The only doubt that arises as to the latter, is that raised in dealing with the problem of the Irish Migratory Labourer. Experience might show the need for retaining the Seasonal Workers&apos; Regulation in a strictly limited application to migrants or to men who did not normally
work in agriculture for as much as (say) 24 weeks each year. We hope that even this limited use of the Regulation would be avoided, but it could be used at need.114. There remains one point for further consideration. The claims of all persons, whether smallholders or others, who are employed in agriculture only for limited periods or occasionally would be suitably regulated by the ratio rule suggested above. If, however, there are people who, while living mainly by a small-holding, work for a farmer on one or two days a week throughout the year they will not be affected. They will be able to build up a big contribution claim while it will be hard to test their unemploy-ment. If there is a substantial class of persons of this character and if they give rise to difficulty, they can and should be dealt with directly. Power might be taken by regulation to place special limits on the period of benefit of persons who do not normally work as employees for more than two days in a week. Under the suggested ratio rule this could be done quite simply, by providing that, in their case, three, contributions should count only as one ; the difficulty arises really through the possibility of paying a full week&apos;s contri-bution for one or two days of employment. An alternative limitation would be to pay benefit in such cases only for each calendar week of unbroken unemployment. This principle might be of value also in dealing with claims from the Piece-work Contractors described above.&apos; 115. There is an ample variety of defences available against possible dangers to an agricultural scheme of insurance. All that is needed is to choose the right line of defence in each case. It is not practicable or really desirable, as was proposed by the Central Landowners&apos; Association, to limit insurance to regular workers, by scope, that is to say, at the contribution end. It is practicable, by appropriate rules for benefit, to give cover for practically all their unemployment to those who seek employment regularly in agriculture, without making them pay for all the unemployment of those who seek such work only for particular seasons or occasions.(5) Special Rates of Contribution for Long Hieings.116. In Scotland, the North of England, and many parts of Wales there exists a system of hirings for twelve months or six months which, so far as we know, is not found in any other industry. It is not clear that these long hirings lead to a greater general stability of employment than the weekly contract which is typical of agriculture throughout the South of England. The annual or six-monthly recurrence of the hiring fair suggest the possibility of change and may turn the balance in favour of changing now rather than become-ing bound for a further long period. A worker who fails to secure employment at a hiring fair (as some undoubtedly do) may find it hard to get to anything but casual employment till the next Fair. The prevalence of long hirings, as we have seen, does not prevent
Scotland from having a rate of unemployment not much less than that of England and nearly as high a proportion of &quot; casual &quot; to &quot; regular &quot; workers in the Agricultural Returns.117. On the other hand, a long hiring does prevent the standing off of men in periods of temporary slackness. We propose that in such cases there should be a lower rate of contribution, to be paid in advance. The concession that we suggest in the case of men aged 21 and over, is a reduction, of 25 per cent, on a yearly hiring and 12J per cent, on a six-monthly hiring. In place of affixing an 8d. stamp (representing his own and the workman&apos;;s contribution) each week, the employer will be allowed to affix, at the beginning of the hiring, a quarterly stamp at the rate of 6(1. a week, that is to say 6s. 6d. ; in order to make sure that the stamp is fixed in advance and not retrospectively, he will be required to get it date-stamped at the post office at which he buys it. The affixing of the first quarterly stamp of 6s. 6d. will be proof of a binding contract for a. year between employer and employee. While the contract en-dures the latter will not be able to draw any unemployment benefit. The employer will deduct 3d. a week from the employee&apos;s wages. Six months&apos; linings will be dealt on the same principle, by the affixing of a stamp, at the. rate of 7d. a week, that is to say 7s. 7d. for each quarter, and the deduction of 3Jd. a week from the era-ployee&apos;s wages. Men under 21 and women and girls would be treated on the same lines by granting suitable reductions.118. There remains the possibility that the contract might be broken within the stipulated period, e.g., by misconduct justifying dismissal. In such a case the workman, under the general rules now in force will automatically be disqualified fo&apos;r benefit for a period up to six weeks. After that he will be. able to claim benefit. Regula-tiona will be needed to determine what shall be done about contri-butions and wage deductions in such cases or on the death of the employee.119. The giving of substantial discounts for long hirings, which cut off the risk of unemployment from the fund for six months or a year at a time, is in our view the best way of meeting the claim put forward on behalf of farmers in Scotland either for exclusion from insurance or for special treatment. But the concession as we propose it, is not limited to Scotland. The reduced composition fee will be available for long hirings amounting to a definite contract, in. any-part of Britain. It will not be allowed for regular employ-ment, without a binding contract for six months or a year. i120. The amount of the reduction, whether 25 per cent, or 12fl per cent, is greater than the recorded difference of unemployment I between Scotland and the rest of Britain. But it must be reinem- j bered that the long hirings do not apply to all men in Scotland and I do apply to many parts of England and Wales. It may prove that B under this system Scotland draws; out less under the agricultural I scheme than she pays in contributions.   It is about as likely that jj
she will draw more out. It will be important to show separately, at least by estimate, the contributions and expenditure, both of Scotland and the other districts where long hirings are common.(6) Transfers between Agricultural and General, Scheme.121. The fact that persons may pass from the agricultural to the general scheme and vice versa calls for some provision for determination-ing what conditions as to benefit are applied to them. We have con-sidered a number of alternative methods suggested to us by the Ministry of Labour. So far as we can judge in advance of experi-ence, the simplest and justest way of dealing with the problems is on the lines set out below. Experience may suggest improve-ments : (a) If at the beginning of his benefit year a claimant&apos;s in-dustrial contributions entitle him to benefit he should be allowed to draw benefit at the industrial rate and under the industrial conditions, throughout that benefit year, and to have his addi-tional benefit under the general ratio rule calculated on the basis of all contributions of both kinds and all benefits of both kinds drawn in the appropriate five years.(b) If, on the other hand, at the beginning of the benefit year, the claimant is not qualified in industrial contributions alone but is qualified to draw agricultural benefit, he should draw benefit at the agricultural rate throughout that year, again counting for the purposes the agricultural ratio rule all con-tributions of both kinds and all benefits of both kinds drawn in the appropriate period, with the proviso that, if subsequently he pays industrial contributions which would qualify him for industrial benefit (without counting agricultural contribu-tions), he should then, in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister, be entiled to re-assessment of his claim to.benefit both as to rate and period. In this re-assessment, he should have counted against him all benefits already re-ceived at the agricultural rate, that is to say, there would be no change in the date of his benefit year.(c) The cost of the benefit drawn in such transfer cases should be allocated to the agricultural and the general scheme respectively by certificate of the Minister of Labour given in accordance with Regulations.(7) Numbers affected and Finance of Scheme.122.. The finance of the agricultural scheme depends upon three main factors; (1) the number of insured persons, (2) the rate of unemployment, and (3) the proportion of this unemployment likely to be covered by benefit under the rules of the scheme. In respect of each of these three factors, the distribution of the insured per-sons by age and sex is relevant, as this affects both the contribu-tions and benefits proposed and the incidence of unemployment.
123. As regards numbers insured, we estimate that the agricul-tural seheme will cover approximately 750,000 persons aged U to 65, distributed by age and sex as follows : Age Group. Males. Females. Total.14-17......      ... 95,500 8,500 104,00018-20    ......... 78,500 8,500       87,00021-64    ......      ... 529,000 30,000 559,000Total       ...      ...      703,000      47,000      750,000124. This estimate is based on consideration of the population census of 1931, and of the agricultural returns of numbers employed, as interpreted to us by representatives of the agricultural depart-ments. It is approximate only, since it is impossible to assess with any certainty the exact effect of our proposals for including or excluding particular groups of workers.125. As regards the rate of unemployment, for the rea&quot;sons set out in Appendix A; we assume an average of 7-5 per cent.126. As regards the proportion of unemployment that will be covered by benefit under the rules that we propose, only the most tentative estimates can be made, based on assumptions as to the dufational distribution of Unemployment among different sections of those insured, that is to say, of the proportion of insured per-sons who will be out of work for one, two, three months and so on in the course of each year, and of what will happen to them in successive years. This is obviously a matter on which definite information can be obtained only in the actual working of the insurance scheme. In respect of the proportion of total unemploy-ment that will rank for benefit, whether under a ratio rub, or any other rule, all that can be done is to ask an assumption as ,to the most probable durational distribution of unemployment, in the light of general considerations and of whatever particular state-ments are available.127. This is a matter specially considered by the Government Actuary in the communication which we print as Appendix B to our Report. In the light of such information as is now available, the Government Actuary estimates that, under the rules proposed by us, 57 per cent, of all the unemployment in agriculture will rank for benefit in the first year during which benefit is payable. On this basis he puts the total expenditure on benefit in that year at  1,303,000. Administration expenses absorb  191,000. The contribution income is put at  1,529,000. This leaves a surplus of  35,000 for the first year. This calculation assumes the higher rate of children&apos;s benefit, given in paragraph 91. With the lower rate.of children&apos;s benefit, we are advised by the Government Actuary that the total expenditure on benefit-would be  1,268,000 and the surplus in the first year would be  70,000.
128. In years after the first year of benefit, it. is possible that the proportion of total unemployment covered by benefit will rise, as regular workmen accumulate contributions. On the other hand, the effect of the first six months of contributions, in giving a sub-stantial claim to less regular workers, will have been exViusted. In view of these uncertainties, it seems best to take the 57 per cent, proportion of the first year as the basis of the scheme. The accumulated contributions of the first six months without benefit will form a reserve, allowing of time for revision of the rules of the scheme, if experience shows the need for revision.(8) Administration.129. We have examined with great interest a scheme submitted to us by the Central Landowners&apos; Association for administration of unemployment insurance in agriculture by local lodges of the men concerned. We have considered also a suggestion that ad-ministration might be left to the rural approved societies estab-lished for health insurance.130. We are satisfied, however, that every reason, both of general principle and of administrative convenience, requires that the administration of the agricultural scheme should, so far as pos-sible, be assimilated to that of the general scheme and should be undertaken by the same authority, namely, the Ministry of Labour, through its organisation of Employment Exchanges and local offices. This will involve some extension of the present machinery, in particular :  (a) the setting up of a number of new branch offices and possibly the introduction of travelling officers; and(b) the extension of the present panels of Courts of Referees.It should not involve setting up, alongside the existing Courts of Referees, which have to function in rural as well as urban areas for the persons already insured there, a separate system of agricul-tural Courts. The inclusion in. insurance of the principal industry of rural areas, namely agriculture, will mean that the panels of referees there will be predominantly drawn from agriculture. But the Courts of Referees should deal on similar principles with all rural cases, whether under the agricultural scheme or under the general scheme.131. For the payment of agricultural contributions it will be necessary to have a distinct set of insurance stamps. But so far as we can judge there is no reason for introducing a distinct un-employment book. A workman passing from agriculture to other work would take the same book but have different stamps affixed to it.132. The provisions of the general scheme, applying to agri-culture as to other industries, will include section 17 of the Act of 1920. Under this section, associations of insured persons can make
arrangements for the administration of benefit to their own members. In the general scheme of insurance a large number of arrangements under section 17 are in force, in nearly ail cases with trade unions. But there is nothing in principle to exclude associa. tions of other kinds, for instance, approved societies, from making such arrangements if they can satisfy the general conditions. These conditions are that the association concerned should pay, from its own resources, some unemployment benefit over and above the statutory benefits, and than the association- should have some effective means of notifying vacancies of employment to its members. A few approved societies do in fact administer unemployment-ployment insurance lor their members under the general scheme. It will be open to approved societies in rural areas to apply to the Minister of Labour for similar arrangements under the agricultural scheme.133. An appropriate share of the cost of administering the agri-cultural scheme in combination with the general scheriie, should be charged against the agricultural contributions, subject to the proviso that the charge should not exceed one-eighth of these con-tributions. In the general scheme, with this same proviso, the actual cost of administration is much less. The agricultural scheme, particularly having regard to the lower rate of contribu-tions, will be more costly in proportion to income, and we have based the finance of the scheme on the assumption that the full one-eighth will be required. (We propose that, at least for the first five years, the cost of administration charged to the agri-cultural scheme should be one-eighth of the agricultural contribu-tion income. At the end of that time it will be possible to&apos; determine, whether a detailed allocation of costs is desirable.134. It was suggested to us, even by some of those who agreed with us in regarding the Ministry of Labour as the appropriate authority for administering unemployment insurance in agri-culture, that there might be advantage in setting up a Beard or Committee &apos; representative of agricultural interests specially to supervise the scheme and to report upon it. If the setting up of such a Committee contributed anything material to the ready acceptance of an insurance scheme by agricultural interests we should be the last persons to oppose this.135. But we are not sure that such a course would be attended by practical advantage.136. On the one hand, the statutory provisions under svhich we work provide for notice to and representation from all parties likely to be interested when either the finance, or the regulations, of unemployment insurance are under consideration ; in the pr* ceedings leading to&apos; our present report, we have had all the repre-sentative bodies concerned before us and we have appreciate1! greatly the frank and&apos; business-like manner in which they have discussed with us the issues raised and have given us the benefit
of their first-hand experience. No Agricultural Statutory Com-mittee, however constituted, could safely dispense with this pro-cedure; the conditions and problems of different sections of agriculture in different parts of the country are so diverse that no one man or Committee can judge of them all of his own knowledge.137. On the other hand, under a division of functions between ourselves for the general scheme and another Committee for the agricultural scheme, there would be so many points of contact and so many common problems for the two schemes, that some authority must at some stage consider the two together.138. With these observations we leave this matter to the judgment of others and conclude our proposals.PART III. COMMENTS.139. In the foregoing section of Our report we have set out our proposals for insurance against unemployment in agriculture. In a sentence, these proposals mean the extension to agriculture of the existing scheme of unemployment insurance, with special rates of benefit and contribution, and with two special conditions to suit the case of agriculture.140. The weekly rate of benefit proposed for an adult man is 12s.., with 6s. 6d. for an adult dependant and (subject to the con-sideration named below) 3s. for the first dependent child and 2s. 6d, for each other dependent child, subject to a maximum limit of 30s. a week. This yields, for a family of man, wife and two children, 24s. a week or 80 per cent, of the benefit in other industries under the general scheme of insurance. If it is felt that the benefit for dependent children cannot be higher in the agricultural scheme than the rate ruling at the same time in the general scheme, the scale proposed is as above, except that the allowance for each dependent child would be 2s., yielding, for a family of man, wife and two children, 22s. 6d. a week, or 75 per cent, of the benefit in other industries under the general scheme of insurance.141. The weekly rate of contribution proposed for an adult man is 4d. a week each from employer, employee and the State, or 40 per cent, of the contribution under the general scheme. There are lower rates of contribution and benefit for women and young persons of various ages.142. The rates of contribution in the agricultural scheme are designed to cover the cost of the benefits under that scheme, with an appropriate share of administrative expenditure. In substance, the agricultural scheme of insurance will be financially self-contained, without liability either for the accumulated debt of the unemployment fund or for the present higher rate of unemploy-ment in other industries.143. The special conditions proposed for the agricultural scheme are first,  that the  Seasonal  Workers&apos;   Regulation  under  the Anomalies Act should not be applied to agriculture in general; second, that the period of benefit under the agricultural scheme 27462 0
should be governed, in the main, by a. ratio rule. The actual rule suggested at the outset will allow two weeks of benefit for, the first 10 unexhausted contributions and one week of benefit for every two unexhausted contributions beyond 10 at the beginning of the benefit year.144. These special conditions are designed to deal with two special features of agriculture its dependence on seasons and its large use of occasional labour. Under these conditions, the regular; worker, the man wholly dependent on agricultural employment for his livelihood, will, we hope, be covered for practically all his unemployment; the partial! worker will get some, though partial, cover.145. Apart from these two special conditions, the agricultural scheme will be assimilated as closely as possible to the general scheme of insurance and will be administered by the same authority, namely, the Ministry, of Labour, through its organisa-, tion of employment exchanges and local offices, extended as necessary to render complete and efficient service in rural districts.146. The agricultural scheme will apply to horticulture and forestry, as well as to all branches of agriculture in the narrow sense. It will apply, on the same terms, in Scotland as well as in England and Wales, in view of the substantial similarity in respect of the volume of unemployment between these two countries. There will, however, be substantial reductions of the rate of contribution (up to 25 per cent.) where workers are engaged under binding contract for a year or six months. This practice of long hirings is prevalent in the whole of Scotland, most of the north of England and many parts of Wales.147. The proposals include powers to deal with a variety of borderline problems in respect of the scope of insurance. The most important of these are the exclusion from insurance of farmers&apos; sons and other relatives, and the application to the agricultural scheme of the Subsidiary Employments Order under health law surance, which exempts from insurance persons engaged in seasonal work,.such as hop-picking and fruit-picking, if they are not already insured. Provision is made for persons working sometimes in. agriculture and sometimes in other insured industries.148. The foregoing is the briefest possible summary of out pro-posals,&apos;. In Part II we have set them out with as much detail as we could, so that those on whom the decision now rests either to,act or;not to act upon our Report may decide with full knowledge of\what is: involved.149. We should add that we framed proposals, up to the point of1 drafting our Report almost in final form for signature, without knowledge of the scales of assistance likely to be in operation under the Unemployment Assistance Act. The Draft Regulations governing this matter; are dated 11th December, 1934, only nine days-: earlier than our own Report.
150. There has been no time for us to examine the Draft Regula-tions closely, nor would it be easy by an. examination to say in advance, just how the assistance scale proposed will compare in practice with our scales of benefit for particular families in rural districts. In general, apart from deductions for lower rent, for other resources or for &quot; special circumstances &quot;, it is clear that the assistance scale will yield weekly incomes above those of our benefit scales. But, when allowance is made for lower agri-cultural rent, the differences from the higher of our two scales are not very great. Freedom from deductions of all kinds and from all enquiries, as well as the sense of drawing benefit in respect of personal contributions, may in most cases make benefit seem preferable to assistance, and may reduce, to a minimum appli-cations for supplementary assistance. On this point experience alone can throw light. If it is thought desirable at any time, in view of the assistance scale, to raise our proposed rates of benefit, this can be done without affecting the structure of our scheme, though, on the statistical and actuarial data before us, it can safely be done only by raising the rate of contributions or reducing the proportion of unemployment ranking for benefit.151. Our terms of reference require us to submit our proposals for insurance in agriculture &quot; as soon as may be &quot; after the passing of the Act. For reasons indicated at the end of our Report, we believe that this urgency is justified. We proceeded with our task of framing an agricultural scheme of insurance as rapidly as we could, making sure that all parties concerned had a full hearing, but avoiding fresh lengthy investigations of our own. We believe that now we can best contribute to the combined con-sideration by others of insurance and assistance, as two sides of a single problem, by submitting our proposals at once and seeking to show thereby that insurance against unemployment in agriculture is practicable.152. In dealing at short notice with so many complicated and letailed questions, we may well, in particular cases, have suggested methods which experience will prove to be not the best methods. Our proposals are experimental and should be regarded as subject to variation after experience. In this respect they follow the precedent of the Unemployment Insurance Act for other industries. That Act sets up machinery for adjusting the details and the finance of the insurance scheme to changing conditions and new experience. In detail any scheme of unemployment insurance in agriculture may and should be varied by experience. That some scheme of insurance for that industry is practicable we are prepared to assert without hesitation. We say this, after considering all the main objections that have been made in the past to such insurance. These objections may be reviewed briefly as follows :  27462 D
(1) That there is no information as to the extent of unemploymei in agriculture and therefore no actuarial basis for an irisuranct scheme.153. In so far as it is true that unemployment in agricultiirt cannot be measured until an insurance scheme has been introduced, this is an objection which might have been applied equally to the introduction of insurance at any time in any industry. I( is only in the working of an insurance scheme that accurate and comprehensive knowledge of unemployment can be obtained.154. Every scheme of insurance against unemployment, in the past, has been framed on estimates of the volume and incidence of unemployment for which there was often a very narrow basis of ascertained facts. The actuarial calculation on which the original scheme of insurance in 1911 was applied to some two-and-a-hal! million persons in selected industries rested on returns from traJe unions, covering altogether about one-eighth of.the number to be insured, all of the skilled classes, and leaving out nearly all the principal occupations, both skilled and unskilled, in the largest and most fluctuating industry then included, namely building and public works contracting. When insurance was made general in 1920, there was for most of the industries included even less in-formation than in 1911; for some industries with a total of insured persons exceeding that of agriculture there was no statistical record of unemployment at all : the expectations on which the scheme was launched were defeated entirely by the post-war depres-sion. For the agricultural scheme now proposed, there is probably a better statistical basis than on either of these previous occasions, But, if the information were far less than it is, we should still not regard that as a reason for thinking insurance impracticable.(2) That it is impossible to define the limits of insurability in agri-culture .155. There are, of course, difficulties in defining the precis scope of insurance against unemployment in agriculture, as in ever; other industry. But in the past 14 years for the general scheiu of unemployment insurance, and in the past 20 years for healll insurance, similar difficulties have been encountered and overcome in one industry after another, by the officers concerned to adminii ter these two schemes. Those who stress this difficulty often i so without knowledge of how similar difficulties are being handle daily under the existing schemes of insurance.156. The problem of the limits of insurability in agriculta is in some ways easier and in some ways harder than in otto industries. We are not likely to encounter in agriculture to tit same extent as elsewhere, the problems of the married woman of daily casual labour or of persons on chronic short time. Oni other hand, there are in agriculture a number of special problems, noted above, under the heads of the Family Farm, the Piece-work
2p 1 0 0Contractor, the, Special,; Seasonal, Worker, the &apos; Irish Migratory Labqurer,, thePrivate -Gardeper, the&quot; Resident. Casual, and the Small-holder, or,: Crofter., In, /the. sections - of&apos; our -Report - dealing with Scope,-and with Conditions. and, Period-of Benefit, we have analysed each-fof, these.-problems and-suggested ways -of solving them. &apos;&apos; &apos;        - -      ^ ^(3) That it will be.impossibleto administer unemployment insur-. ance in rural, areas.157. It is obvious that a considerable extension of the existing machinery of the Ministry of Labour will be required if the prin-cipal industry of the rural.,areas and not only the, few insured people now to be found in country villages are. to be covered by insurance. But there is no.-serious, difficulty-in making such an extension.(4) That the introduction of insurance against unemployment will lead to further casualisation of the industry and increased unemployment.- - . &apos;     1158. It is undeniable&apos;that the availability of unemployment benefit may in some cases lead farmers who would otherwise have made, occasions of keeping their men at work, to stand,them off in future at slack seasons. In estimating the rate of unemployment for the purposes of our scheme we have allowed for some increase, of un-employment above that, now&apos;&quot;recorded, but we cannot believe that this increase is likely to be more than very small.,159. We believe that even with,the insurance scheme the desire to spread employment, particularly since many labourers will still in off-seasons be occupying a farm cottage, will operate.. We pro-pose to encourage the continuance of.long hirings by. a substantial: reduction of contributions. On the other hand,, in so far,as farmers now make needless work or pay wages for nothing during unemploy-raent and after the introduction of this scheme . may avoid such payments, the scheme will lighten, instead, of increasing, the burdenI upon them.(5) That the introduction of insurance will impose upon employers and employees excessive burdens.160. The contributions that we propose, though higher than those [contemplated by previous enquirers, cannot, be regarded as excessive in relation to the agricultural wage, when regard is had to the much higher contributions paid by. working people not much better off in other industries. We are satisfied that the greater part of the agricultural workers are not only willing but anxious to pay con-tributionsfor insurance against unemployment. As regards the employers, the contribution.required is smaller in proportion of their wages bill, than in many other industries. Having regard to the feeling of fellowship,which exists in-this industry, we-do.not doubt [their acquiescence in paying,this contribution if as the evidence27462 d 2
shows-&quot;the men in the industry generally desire insurance. Objec-tion to burdening agriculture arises, we believe, largely from the&apos; fear that agriculture may be thrown into the general scheme of insurance and that the cohtributibns paid by employers and work-people there, will be Used to pay for the heavier unemployment of other industries. Our proposals are a complete safeguard against this. The other idea underlying this objection has been that: insurance was hot really heeded, so that in relation to requirements any contribution however small would be an excessive burden. This brings us to the final objection.      -(6) That insurance against unemployment in agriculture is not needed because unemployment is negligible, and. that such unemployment as exists can be dealt with by assistance under Part II of the Unemployment Act, 1934.161. Our investigations and the evidence tendered to us from many quarters show us that the argument that unemployment in agriculture is negligible can no longer be maintained. The unem-ployment rate which we are compelled to assume for the purpose of our scheme is materially higher than in many of the industries which are now insured against unemployment and which nobody proposes to exclude from insurance. Granted that there is an appreciable volume of unemployment in agriculture, it ought not to be left for treatment by unemployment assistance alone. The policy of the Unemployment Act as applied to all other industries is (1): that for those who lose employment, there should, as a first line of defence against distress, be an unemployment benefit, drawn as of right in respect of contributions paid and without regard to other means, drawn as an extension of wages to cover periods of inevitable idleness as well as periods of active employment; (2) that those who exhaust their claim to benefit should be adequately cared for thereafter by public authorities, but that in that case regard should be had to other resources, that the public funds should not be called upon where they are not needed. In the application of this policy we can see no reason at all for differen-negotiation between agriculture and any of the other industries. It will, we believe, be an indefensible anomaly, leading to widespread sense of injustice and grievance on one side or the other, if the village carpenter or road worker falling out of employment first gets unemployment benefit and comes to assistance only after benefit is exhausted, while his neighbour who is an agricultural labourer is referred at once to the authorities for assistance.162. Prom this point of view we should have wished that in-surance against unemployment in agriculture could have been in force at the time when assistance under the Unemployment Assist-ance Board was extended to rural districts. That is no longer possible. - If our proposals are accepted by the Government, they require legislation and after that some months for setting up the
machinery of administration. Some interval between the taking over by the Unemployment Assistance Board in March, 1935, of the relief of unemployed persons now outside insurance and the I bringing of agricultural workers into insurance is inevitable. During this interval the situation will be anomalous and unsatisfactory and, in our opinion, ought to be set right as soon as possible.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants.,W. H.

APPENDIX A.Statistics of Unemployment in..Agriculture.1. There are no current statistical records which in any way make it possible&apos; to judge the volume of unemployment in Agriculture. The Employ ment Exchanges are formally open to register&apos;agricultural labourers seeking vacancies, but do not effectively-cover the rural districts and their registers of agricultural labourers are almost negligible. The Public Assistance Com-mittees do receive ascertain number of applications from agricultural labourers who are out of work, but in view of the widespread and extreme reluctance of such men to apply for assistance the numbers of those so assisted are no index- of the volume- of unemployment. The only direct statistical record of unemployment in agriculture (as in other industries now excluded from unemployment insurance) is that provided by the population census of 26th April, 1931. In this census there was included a question as to unemployment. The head of the household filling in the return was required, in the case of any person in the household who was Qut of work at the time of the census to add the words &quot; out of work &quot; after his occupation, and to give the name- and business of his last employer in that occupation. The information&quot; thus obtained is summarised in the census tables both under &quot; occupations 7&apos;ahd, according to the employees business, under &quot; industries &quot;. The &quot; occupation &quot; volumes of the census have been published, and &quot;it is possible, for each occupation, to give the numbers and percentages returned as &quot;out of work &quot; at all ages and in particular age-groups. The &quot; Industries &quot; volume for England and Wales has not yet been published but by courtesy of the Registrar-General, the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee have received advanced copies of some of the Tables and have been allowed to use those in the presentation of their Report.2. Statistics of unemployment derived from the census refer directly to one day only, to 26th April, 1931-. Two questions arise. First, what is their meaning and importance as a measure of unemployment on that day? / Second, what inference can be drawn from them as to the average rate of unemployment over a period of years? An answer can be given to the first question (1) by comparing statistics of unemployment derived, from the census for industries other than agriculture, with the corresponding statistics compiled by the (Ministry of Labour from the records of unemployment-ment insurance (2) by examining the results of the census statistics for agriculture (3) by considering more closely the actual questions put in the census and the meaning of the answers to them. The result of these com-comparisons is very encouraging as to the value of the census figures. The answer to tfhe second question is not so clear.Comparison of Census and Insurance Statistics of Unemployment in Insured Industries.3. The statistics of unemployment published by the Ministry of Labour are compiled mainly from the records of the attendance of unemployed persons at Local Offices of the Ministry, the great majority of whom are persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, who attend for the purpose of proving unemployment in connection with claims for unemployment ployment benefit or transitional payments. The persons registered at the Exchanges, however, include large numbers who have no claim to benefit o&apos; transitional payments. This section of the Live Register covered on 26th November, 1934, over 235,000 insured persons and over 134,000 uninsured persons, or over 369,000 out of a total live register of 2,120,785. * &apos;ssrures, however, include comparatively few agricultural workers.
So far as the insured, industries are concerned, the evidence available shows that few persons who are really within the industrial field and who are genuinely unemployed fail to attend at the Employment Exchanges. Apart from the necessity to attend for the purpose of claims to benefit and for assistance in finding work, the maintenance of registration enables the unemployed person to have his health insurance card franked and he thus avoids the accumulation of arrears of contributions to a very considerable extent. The official statistics of unemployment among insured persons compiled by the Ministry of Labour constitute accordingly a standard by which the usefulness of. the census returns may. be judged.4. Some advance figures are now available from the industry tables corn-piled from the census returns, and in Table I attached a comparison is made between the figures for males derived from the census and those corn-piled by the Ministry of Labour. In making this comparison it is necessary to bear in mind that the two sets of figures may differ in general scope, in the industrial classification of particular businesses or departments and in-the definition of unemployment.5. Differences of General Scope. The census figures in Table I relate to operative employees and persons out of work; they include uninsured as well as insured persons, that, is to say, they include persons aged 14 and 15, and 65 and over, and they also include some of the non-manual workers ivhose rate of remuneration exceeds  250 per year. Managers of all kinds are, however, excluded. They probably include also a certain number of persons who are not employed under a contract of service e.g., as out workers. On the other hand the statistics compiled by the Ministry of Labour for 27th April, 1931, are limited to persons aged 16-64 who were insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.Table I includes all the separately specified insured industries, except National Government and Railway Service (where only a relatively minor proportion of workers are insured). In this Table the total number of males covered by the census return is 10,510,604 while the number insured is S,6S8,970, or 82&apos;7 per cent. A substantial proportion of the balance, of 173 per cent, is in particular industries to which insurance applies only partially (Gas, Water and Electricity Supply; Local Government; Commerce and Finance; Professional Services). Among the remainder of the 17&apos;3 per cent, are classes with a relatively high rate of unemployment (those aged 65 and upwards) and others with a relatively low rate of unemployment (tliose under 16 and the non-manual workers earning more than  250 a year). These two sections to some, extent offset one another. On balance, differences in the general scope of the figures are not likely to lead to wide differences in the percentage of unemployment.6. Differences in Classification of Industries. The definition of particular ndnstries for the census and for Unemployment Insurance, though broadly similar, may not always have yielded identical results in the classification of particular Businesses or Departments. Such differences are illustrated in Table I by particular industries for which the number insured actually exceeds the census figure (e.g. Explosives; General and Constructional Engineering). The industrial content of the various groups for which separate figures are given is not ordinarily the same, in every case, for the Census Tables and for unemployment insurance statistics, but as far as possible adjustment has been made to produce oomparable groups.7. Differences in Definition of Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour statistics distinguish between persons wholly unemployed and those who are temporarily stopped, or are casual workers not working on that particular day. In Table I accordingly, two percentages are given for each industry in respect of persons aged 16 to 64 insured under the Unemployment Insur-ance Acts that of the wholly unemployed, and a total figure including both 27462 D i
-these, and the temporarily stopped and casual workers. In some industries, where there is much systematic short time (e.g. Cotton, Wool, Smelting and Rolling of Iron and Steel) or much casual employment (e.g. Dock, Harbour, River and Canal Service) the &quot; wholly unemployed &quot; and the total percent-age differ considerably. In other industries the two percentages are fairly close to one another. This is generally true of the industries with regular employment and low unemployment rates (e.g. nearly all the industries in table I with a percentage wholly unemployed of less than 10).In the census returns no exact distinction can be made between persons wholly unemployed and those temporarily stopped. Only one figure can be given. There is little doubt that a person who normally looks to regular employment for a livelihood and who had been definitely discharged from employment would be returned on the census paper as &quot;out of work,&quot; but there is room for uncertainty as to the entry to be made in respect of persons on short time, or temporarily suspended, and even in the case of persons who obtain a livelihood by casual employment. The fact that the census was taken on a Sunday is an important point in connection with the record for casual workers. It may be noted, however, that the census instructions state that &quot; Where a person has not been employed at his normal occupa-tion for a considerable time, he should, if still seeking to earn a living by it, enter that occupation and add &quot; (Out of work).&quot; This, and a further reference to having &quot; ceased to be employed at his normal occupation &quot; make it likely that most persons who had been stopped temporarily but expected to go on .with the same employer would not enter themselves as &quot; out of work &quot; for census purposes. The census of unemployed should correspond more closely to the wholly unemployed of the Ministry of Labour figures than to the total of the wholly unemployed and the temporarily stopped. Table I accords exactly with this expectation. The census percentages of unemployment in the various industries lie between the two Ministry of Labour percentages but much nearer to the percentage of the wholly unem-ployed than to the total percentage. The general percentage shown at the foot of Table I in the census returns is 16-6 as compared with 15-4 for the wholly unemployed and the total percentage of 21-3 in the Ministry of Labour returns.The outstanding feature of Table I, however, is not this general coni-parison, but the close resemblance, industry by industry, between the census percentages and the lower of the two Ministry of Labour percentages, that for the wholly unemployed. Marked differences between these two figures are practically confined to a few industries with special circumstances, such as Fishing or Dock, Harbour etc. Service. The main lesson of Table I is to suggest that the census returns have real value as an indication of the com-parative levels of unemployment in different industries.8. Census Statistics of Unemployment in Agriculture. The principal information now available from the census as to unemployment in agricul-ture is set out in Tables II, III and IV attached. Table II is taken from the published occupations volumes, while Tables III and IV are taken from the industry tables, not yet published. For agriculture, in the narrow sense, there is little difference between the occupational and the industrial classification. Most persons employed in agricultural occupations are employed by persons whose business is agriculture. But this is not true of horticulture. The occupations Table there includes large numbers of gardeners and gardeners&apos; labourers in private employ who are entered nidus-trially not in horticulture but in personal service. The same thing holds to a less extent of other occupations; conversely, no doubt, there are sow men of non-agricultural occupations employed in the industry of agriculture. But on balance, owing to the inclusion of private gardeners and gardeners&apos; labourers, Table II based on occupations covers a much larger number than Table III, 861,200 males aged 14 to 64, as compared with 727,170. Forth insurance scheme set out in the report it is necessary to take as basis tie
Industry Table III, but Table II is also indispensable, as it alone stows separately the farmers&apos; sons and other relatives whom the scheme excludes. Table IV is of relatively less value than either, since it includes operatives of 65 and upwards.9. For the immediate purpose of indicating the statistical value of the census r-esutts all the Tables deserve examination. Table II represents two censuses taken in diiferent countries by distinct authorities, though on identical schedules. There appears a striking agreement, between England and Wales and Scotland, in the unemployment percentages for each important occupational group. Foa- shepherds the percentage is 2-6 in Scotland as against 2-1 in England and Wales; for men employed in tending cattle it is 2-5&apos;as against 2-3 and so on. For women the numbers are smaller and the percentages more liable to casual error, but here again the percentages for all the largest groups dairying, agricultural labour not otherwise distinguished, farmers relatives are similar. The general corre-spondence of results in the two countries is Very encouraging as to their10. Table III showing all operatives aged 14 to 64 in the industry of agriculture (including horticulture and forestry), grouped by ages confirms this impression. For males the unemployment percentages are very low at the ages 14-15, they arise to the age group 21-29, are lower for the next two or three groups and from 35-44 onwards increase steadily with advancing years. This reflects with singular accuracy the age analysis of unemployment in the insured industries as recorded by the Ministry of Labour. A sample analysis made in December, 1932, shows unemployment increasing with age up to a first maximum in the age group 21-29, then falling, and rising above the first maximum from 45 or 50 onwards. For women the numbers in agriculture are much smaller but there is a similar though less marked distribution of unemployment by age. A minor point worth noticing is that among males the percentages for Scotland are higher than those for England in all the early age groups, up to 29, and lower in all the later groups. For females the position is almost exactly reversed; the Scottish percentages are lower than the English in the early age-groups, up to 17, and higher in all later groups. These differences are related no doubt to the differing importance in the two countries, of various types of agriculture. Both in the comparison between the two countries by age groups and the similarity to the Ministry of Labour figures, Table III is as encouraging as Table II for the value of the census results.11. The filling up of the census schedules depends in the last resort on the care taken by each head of a household, but he is not left without guidance or supervision. He is asked to state the occupation precisely (with examples to help) and not in general terms. If there is more than one paid occupation I he has to state only that by which the living is mainly earned. The lemployer entered for the industry classification is the present or last employer I in that principal occupation; if a person out of work entered his occupation las &quot; coal miner &quot; and his last employees business as &quot; farmer &quot;, that would jibe queried by the enumerator and he would not appear as belonging to the liindustry of agriculture. Those who do so appear, at least for agriculture Bin the narrow sense, are people who have given an agricultural occupation Hand their employer as an agricultural employer. In so far as there is any jjlsndency to mis-description of their occupations among those who are out Hof work, it would appear on general grounds more likely that people who Bought to enter themselves as agricultural labourers would enter themselves Bin some other heading (under an industry with unemployment insurance) Thau the reverse. There is no. serious reason for supposing that those who pre classified as belonging to the agricultural industry, whether as in work w as out-of-work are persons who ought properly to be entered elsewhere.value.Meaning of Census Question and Answers.
&quot;The persons so classified cannot, - for instance, include any appreciate number of the townsfolk who take seasonal work as hop-pickers, fruit ai( pea pickers, etc., and fall under the Subsidiary Employments Order. Nou of the chief classes of work under that order begin as early as the end j April. There is a special place.for pea and fruit pickers in the census bit rthe numbers entered are insignificant.Tables II, III and IV cannot, again, include any large number of persons whose main&apos; living -is that of small-holders or1 crofters (since those appear elsewhere) or of pensioners and others past work (for under the census instruction such people should tie entered as &quot;retired&quot; and persons ol 65 and upwards are excluded in any case from Tables II and III)..12. Finally, the census returns can be checked by the agricultural returns made on 4th June each year by farmers. For agriculture in England and Wales (excluding forestry) the operatives in work shown in the census of :26th April, .1931, are 604,000 males and 32,000 females; the numbers out of work were 50,000 and 2,000 respectively. The corresponding figures in the agricultural returns of persons employed a month later are 623,000 males and 93,000 females. The figures for males are in good agreement; some of the 50,000 unemployed of April would have been absorbed by June. The figures for females are not in agreement, but the difference is tiliat the agricultural returns probably include a number of part-time -women workers who would not be returned as &quot;occupied&quot; at the census.For Scotland the census at 26th (April, 1931, gives in agriculture (excluding forestry, land and estate management) 90,000 male operatives in -work and 6,000&apos; out of work. The agricultural returns give 87,500&apos; male operatives as in work at 4th June. For females the corresponding figures are 11,000, 900, and 25,000.Rate of Unemployment.13. The census returns afford a solid basis of facts about unemployment in agriculture. They cannot be disregarded. But they are a starting point only. To answer the second question put above and deduce for the purpose of unemployment insurance, an average rate of unemployment over a period of years, the figures for 26th April, 1931, must be adjusted in various ways. Some of these adjustments rest largely on estimates rather than on ascertained facts.14. Table III shows for all males aged 14. to 64 in agriculture including horticulture and forestry an unemployment percentage of 6-9; for females a percentage of 5-6. This is for Great Britain as a whole; the differences between England and Wales and Scotland will be considered later. Taking the two percentages named as starting point, the following adjustments have to be made.15. First: Table III includes farmers&apos; relatives whom it is proposed to exclude from insurance. In the occupational tables of the census &quot; farmers sons or other relatives assisting in the work of the farm &quot; are shown separately and liave, as might be expected, a very low rate of unemployment?-ment about 0-2 per cent.If these are included with the total of agricultural labourers and hn servants, the percentage of unemployment in agriculture proper (apnrt from horticulture and forestry) is 6-3; their exclusion raises the percentages to 7-3; that is to say by nearly 16 per cent. The proportion of relatives employed in horticulture and forestry is probably less, but cannot be negligible. To allow for exclusion of all relatives, it would not be safe t&apos; increase the percentage of unemployment shown in the industry tables f&quot; males by. less -than one-eighth, that is to say from 6-9 to 7-76.

Second: The Ministry of Labour returns for the insured trades, as stated above, distinguish between persons wholly unemployed and persons who are temporarily stopped or are casual workers standing idle on the day of the count; they yield accordingly two figures of unemployment in each industry one representing. those wholly unemployed, and. the other being a total inclusive of persons temporarily stopped and casuals. The total figure is that required for an, insurance scheme. . , , . , , , . The census percentages lie as a rule between the. two Ministry, of. Labour percentages though nearer to the lower, of them; most but not all of those whom the Ministry of Labour-regards as temporarily stopped would record themselves on the census schedules as in work. - For industries with -regular employment the two Ministry of Labour figures do &apos; not differ greatly and the census percentages as a rule lie between -them. Thus for 1-1 industries in Appendix A with low census unemployment (less than 12 per cent.) the mean census unemployment is 9-84 per cent., the mean of the wholly unem-ployed in the Ministry of Labour return is 9-78 per cent, and the mean of the total unemployment is 10-92 per cent. If the analogy of those industries Were applied to agriculture, it would be necessary &quot;to increase the - per-centage of unemployment recorded in the census, in the proportion -   -or by about 1/9 in order to reach the true rate of total unemployment. i Having regard to the special conditions of agricultural employment with its normah weekly contract, this-correction seems likely,to be excessive. , On the^ other hand, - some increase of recorded unemployment, is .almost certain to follow, by &quot; attraction,&apos;-&apos; on the introduction of:unemployment insurance. It is suggested that an addition of one-seventh to the recorded census rates should be made, (to cover both the temporarily stopped describing themselves as in work and; the effect of&apos; &quot; attraction.&quot; With this addition, the rate of unemployment becomes 8-87 for males and 7-46 for females. -17.

April but there are still&apos;some standing idle; the various harvest activities all come later. In Scotland; the recovery from winter slackness, for those affected, is later than in England. On balance the best answer that it seems possible to give to the first question is that, taking agriculture as a whole, there,is, nothing to suggest that the end of April is either an exceptionally slack or an exceptionally busy season of the year. v. ..        - ,i        i .. . :,.        , .    ,     -r.-n    ... -.  ... -1&apos; The. answer to the second question; is [not.easy.

Unemployment in. agriculture is undoubtedly, affected by the state of the labour market generally. On the whole it seems safe to assume that tin mean rate of unemployment in agriculture over good and bad years will be less than in 1931. A deduction of one-seventh appears reasonable. This, brings the percentage for males down again to 7-60 and for females to 6-39. The weighted mean of these two figures is 7-5, and this has been taken as the percentage rate of total unemployment for the.purpose of the insurance scheme..&apos;. -Unemployment in liural Approved Societies,18. Though the only direct return of unemployment in agriculture is to ho found in the census, of 1931, useful subsidiary evidence can be drawn from the records of Approved -Societies operating health insurance in rural areas. The accounts of these. Societies&apos; reflect loss . of contributions through tlio unemployment of. their-members and so afford-a, measure of unemployment, An examination has been made , by the Government Actuary of the con-tributions experience ; of; 16 .rural Approved Societies, in the quinquennia 1923-27 and 1928-32-.: For the quinquennium 1923-27 this investigation shows an unemployment percentage of 3-7 on. a mean membership of 116,000, For the quinquennium 1,928-32 it shows an unemployment percentage of: 7-2; -on a membership of 135,000. All- the figures relate to males. As these results do not&apos;allow for &quot;attraction&quot; i.e., increase of unemployment through the operation of unemployment insurance, the later figure for 1928-32 is very close indeed to the average of 7-5 per cent, deduced above from the census returns. -In making this comparison, two corrections are needed. On the one hand, the rural Approved Societies presumably include some farmers&apos; rek-tives under contract, of service who would he excluded from the insurance scheme; their exclusion from the Approved Society.figures would&apos; raise the percentage of 7-2. On the other hand, the rural Approved- Societies include persons- employed otherwise.- than in agriculture, horticulture or forestry. What proportion such persons are of the. whole membershp, it is impossible to, say; estimates given to the Committee varied from 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, in particular societies to 45 per cent, of the male members in-all the societies, forming the Federation of Rural Approved Societies. The members who are not agricultural employees would include some classes of low unemployment and others with high unemployment. On balance, it is probable that the. unemployment of the non-agricultural employees would be above the average for- the whole Society, so that their omission would lower the percentage of 7-2 deduced above.For these and other reasons, too much stress must not be laid on the closeness of the.agreement between the percentages deduced from the census -and the Approved,,Societies. But the records of these Societies afford a valuable&apos; independent confirmation of the existence in agriculture of a substantial degree of unemployment, at a level somewhere, about that assumed for the insurance scheme. &apos; .   .. Distribution of Unemployment bij Sex and Locality.19. The percentage of unemployment recorded in the census are not materially different for the two sexes; in Table III they are 6-9 for males and 5-6 for &apos; females. These figures - include farmers&apos; relatives with low unemployment who bulk more largely among the females than among tin males, so that their exclusion would bring the percentages closer together, The remaining difference must be less than in many insured industries and affords no ground for any attempt to discriminate in contributions on this ground of different risks of unemployment.
^9 020. Among males the unemployment shown in&apos; Table III is higher in England.and Wales than in Scotland,; 7-0.-per cent. as. against 6-2 per cent. Among females, it is lower in England, and Wales than in Scotland, 5-2 per cent, as against 7-0 per cent. These comparisons relate to agriculture, horticulture and forestry as a whole. In each of the principal Occupations shown separately in Table II, the unemployment in Scotland is as a rule higher than in England and Wales. Among males, shepherds have a per-centage unemployment in England and WTales of .2-1, in Scotland of 2-6; for men employed in tending cattle, etc., the corresponding figures are 2-3 and 2-5; for agricultural. labourers and farm servants not otherwise distinguished, tliej&apos; are 10-0 and 10-9.The fact that Scotland in spite of. its higher unemployment occupation by occupation shows a lower percentage over all males, is due to its having a much larger proportion in the occupations of relatively small unemployment concerned; with &quot;sheep; cattle and horses and fewer men in mixed arable farming. :The system of long hirings prevalent in Scotland does not appear to result in less unemployment than for men doing the same kind of work mainly under- weekly hirings in England and Wales. The lower over-all percentage of unemployment among males in Scotland results from a difference in the relative importance of different types of work. Scotland as compared with England has proportionately far more men in the occupations with 2 or 3 per cent unemployment, concerned with tending sheep, cattle and horses,-and-fewer in the class of &quot; agricultural labourers and farm servants undistinguished &quot; with 10 per cent, unemployment.

In compliance with the request contained in the letters of the 11th and 17th instant from the Secretary of the Committee, I submit the following report on the contributions required to support the proposed scheme of benefits, under the conditions enumerated below.(i) Bate of Unemployment 7-J per cent, (as instructed).(ii) Bate of Benefit per week (subject to a maximum of 30s.) :  	Mai	es.

(6) Initial qualification-twenty contributions to be paid \ before benefit becomes payable, and benefit not to begin until 6 months after contributions first become payable.(c) Other statutory conditions as in the general scheme, with the exception of the first statutory condition.2. i note that it is desired that the rates of contribution applicable to the various sex and age-groups should be roughly proportionate to the weekly rates of benefit, and that it is proposed that there should be a reduction in the rate of contribution applicable to adult men amounting to 25 per cent, in respect of contracts of employment for a complete year and to 12-J Per cent, in respect of half-yearly contracts, for men aged 18 to 20 the reduction in both cases to be 14 per cent.3. As suggested, I have limited my estimates to the first year in which benefits are payable.Basis of Estimates.4. One of the primary factors which have to be considered in the calcula-tion of the rates of contribution required to support the scales of benefits outlined above is the proportion of unemployment which will rank for benefit under the conditions of the scheme.The factors which affect this may be summarised as follows:  (1) The proposed relation of benefit days to contributions paid, here-after referred to as &quot; the ratio rule &quot;.(2) The waiting period as mitigated by the &quot; continuity &quot; rule. (3) The minimum number of contributions which must be paid before benefit is payable.(4) The other miscellaneous disqualifying provisions.Before the effect of the above factors can be gauged it is necessary to estimate the distribution of unemployment according to the duration of the individual spells.5. The rate of unemployment of 7\ per cent, upon which you direct me to base my estimates may result from various durational spreads of unemploy-ment. It would arise under the two extreme cases where 7\ per cent, of the insured were continuously unemployed or where every one of the insured persons was unemployed for just under 4 weeks in the course of a year. Neither of these distributions of unemployment is likely to arise in actual practice but it is obvious that the effect of the conditions of the proposed scheme on the proportion of unemployment which would rank for benefit would be entirely different on these two &quot; spreads &quot; of unemployment both of which produce an overall rate of 7\ per cent.6. The problem with which i was faced was to obtain such a distribution of unemployment according to duration as appeared most likely to be produced in the industry, under conditions in which the volume of unemploy-ment represents practically 4 weeks per insured person; and further to calculate therefrom the proportion which will rank for benefit under the proposed conditions of the scheme of insurance.7. There is no statistical basis from which I could ascertain the spread of unemployment in agriculture, but the evidence submitted to your Committee and that presented to the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance bring out certain broad facts from which i have constructed a distribution of unemployment which would seem likely to represent the actual conditions obtaining in agriculture. Having constructed this distribution i had to proceed to gauge the effect of the various conditions on the proportion of unemployment which will rank for benefit in the first year after benefits become payable.8. The result of my calculations leads me to the following conclusions :-(1) The proposed &quot; ratio &quot; rule has the effect, by itself, of excluding about 33 per cent, of unemployment from benefit;
c69(2) The waiting week combined with the continuity rule excludes a further 6 peT cent of unemployment from benefit;(3) The condition that 20 contributions must be paid before benefit is payable may be expected to exclude a further 2 per cent.; and(4) The various other conditions will exclude a further small proportion which may be placed at 2 per cent.- .Combining the effect of these various factors it appears that the conditions of the: scheme will provide for benefit being paid for about 57 per cent, of the unemployment.   - -9. Although the proposed rules would provide benefit for only 57 per cent, of the unemployment&apos; it may be pointed out that the conditions of the scheme will provide benefit during the whole period of unemployment ex-cluding the waiting period, in respect of about two-thirds of the unem-ployed persons. The remaining one-third consists of those whose unemploy-ment may&apos; be expected to be prolonged and whose contribution credits will be such that only during a small proportion of their unemployment can benefit be paid under the &quot; ratio &quot; rule.10. It is further necessary to estimate the average rate of benefit payable to adult persons, regard being had to the allowances for dependants.&apos;The dependency figures in the Census Volumes provide a statistical, basis from which can be deduced the average rate of benefit payable. Bringing together the various factors involved and after making allowance for the discounts proposed in the cases of long term engagements and for the costs of administration absorbing one-eighth, of the contribution income, I find that the weekly rates of contribution for the special classes work out as follows:  &apos;Ages. Males. Females.d. d, &apos;21-64        .........      ...      ......   12 Wi18-20        .........      ......      ...   104 916-17        ....................    6 4J14-15 .............      ...      ....   .   ...    4* 3&quot;11. In proceeding to aggregate the contribution income it is necessary to estimate the subdivision of-the 750,000 persons which you expect to come within the scheme, into each of the age categories. This I have deduced from the age distribution of the persons engaged in the industry as given in the Census Volumes, and using- the results thus obtained&apos;the following statement sho.ws the estimated amount of annual receipts and expenditure during the ,first year in which benefits are payable :     Contributions............ . 1,529,000Benefits &quot;.v.............   1,303,000Administration Expenses    ......      191,000 1,494,000Surplus  35,00012. The surplus here shown is small in relation to the estimated expendi-ture on benefits; being slightly less than 3 per cent: thereof.. If such a surplus should-be frequently realised within a&quot; series&quot; of years it will,pre-sumably be sufficient to- cover any excess in the years in which the experience is unfavourable;- In any case a fund will be built up to safeguard the benefits from the outset by the contributions received in the six months prior to the beginning of benefits.I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   Atjfbed W.

A P F S N I) I X    II.o r; o 6 f O11th January, 1935Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Labour to refer to your letter of 31st December forwarding the Report of the Statutory Committee for Unemployment Insurance on the subject of unemployment insurance for agriculture, and to thank the Committee for their promptitude in dealing with this matter.The Report will receive the urgent consideration of the Government, but there is one point on which further consultation with the Committee appears to be necessary.The Minister notes that the Committee, upon the inform-ation before them, assume for the purposes of their scheme that the rate of unemployment in the agricultural industry will be 7-jj per cent.      The Committee proceed to base their proposals regarding the finance of the scheme on the calculation that during the first year in which benefit is payable 57 per cent,  of the anticipated unemployment will be covered by benefit and that on the rates of contributions and benefit proposed there&apos; will be a small surplus of income over expenditur in that year.The Committee have doubtless envisaged the position that would arise in subsequent years and,  indeed,  refer to it in paragraph 128 of the Report, but in view of certain consider-ations the Minister wishes to consult them further with regard to it.      He is advised that, with any given rate of unemployment the proportion of unemployment covered by benefit under the scheme proposed by the Committee is likely to increase progress-ively for several years owing to the operation of the ratio ruleaccording to which the number of days of benefit that may be drawn depends on the number of unexhausted contributions to the claimant&apos;s credit.In these circumstances,  it is not at present clear to the Minister that there is a sufficient probability that the proposed scheme will remain solvent after the first,  or at any rate after the second year of benefit, and he would therefore be glad to have the further observations of the Committee on this aspect of the matter. &apos; He would add that in accordance with the normal procedure any Bill introduced to Parliament would be accompanied by a report from the Government Actuary, and the Committee may wish to consult the Government Actuary further on the question and -particularly as to the proportion of unemploy-ment which would be likely to be  covered by benefit in later years.I am to add that in view of the urgency of the matter, the Minister would be glad to be favoured with the Committee&apos;s observations as soon as possible.I am,  Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)  T.&apos;F.  PHILLIPS.Secretary,Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee, Montagu House,Whitehall,^   S.W.1.
17th January,  1935.Sir,I am asked &quot;by the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th January, which was laid &quot;before the Committee at their meeting on January 17th.The point raised in your letter as to the financial soundness of the suggested scheme of insurance against unemploy-ment in agriculture is dealt with briefly in Para.  128 of the Committee&apos;s Report, but they are glad to take this opportunity of amplifying what is said there.The Report of the Government Actuary,  given in Appendix B to the Committee&apos;s Report,  is limited to the first year of benefit.      This is not because the Committee did not wish to consider finance beyond that point, but because they understood that any estimate of the proportion of unemployment that would be covered by benefit under the proposed rules after that year must be so entirely speculative as not to be worth making. In the circumstances it seemed best to confine definite estimates of expenditure to the first year, while pointing out that there would be adequate opportunity for revision of the financial provisions of the scheme,  if experience proved the necessity for. this.It is true,  of course, as is pointed out in your letter and in para.   128 of the Committee&apos;s Report, that under the scheme proposed by the Committee the accumulation of contributions by regular workers in successive years may tend to raise the pro-portion of total unemployment ranking for benefit.    To say how strong will be this tendency is impossible;    estimates  on this point involve assumptions not merely as to the durational distribution of unemployment within each year, but as  oo the history of individuals in successive years.    Whether the pro-portion would rise rapidly or slowly or would ever rise mater-ially above 57% is uncertain.On  the  other hand,  it can be said with some assurance,  on the basis of the Government Actuary&apos;s calculations for the first year of benefit,  that the agricultural scheme,  at the end of that year, will have a balance of about  800,000 in hand (from the initial six months and the surplus of the first benefit year) .On the rate of unemployment assumed and on any supposit-ion which it seems reasonable to make as to the proportion of unemployment that could be covered by benefit under the rules of the Scheme in years after the first year this surplus would not be exhausted until after five years of full working.The substantial answer to your question is that the Committee&apos;s proposals afford ample time and adequate machinery for preserving the balance of agricultural contributions  and expenditure.      If an agricultural scheme is introduced on the lines of the Committee&apos;s report it will be the duty of the Committee at the end of each year to make a report on the financial condition of the agricultural scheme as on that of the general scheme;    the Committee will give statutory notice to the parties concerned of their intention to report;    and they will  report after consultation with those parties.
