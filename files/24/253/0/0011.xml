Memorandum by the Postmaster General.At the Cabinet meeting held on the 24th October 1934 attention was drawn to the fact that the Post Office and Telegraph (Money) Bill must be passed into law before the Summer Recess,  1935,  and the Cabinet approved its inclusion in the list of annual or compulsory Bills.    (Cabinet Conclusion 36(34)).Capital for development of the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone systems is provided by advances made by the National Debt Commissioners and repaid to them by means of annuities charged on the Post Office Vote.   The capital expenditure authorised by the various Acts amounts to  177,021,083; the outstanding balance, i,e. amounts borrowed, less repayments, will be about  100,500,000 at the 31st March 1935.The last Act was passed in 1931 and authorised the issue cf capital to the extent of  32,000,00(3.     This sum will, it is estimated, be exhausted by about June 1935.The Bill will authorise the issue of  34,000,00$,  of which it is estimated that  30,000,000 will be required for the Telephone service and  4,000,000 for the Postal and Telegraph services.     It is anticipated that this sum, when added to the      ^, unexpended balance of  2,700,000 available as at 31st March, 1935 from the previous Act, will meet the capital requirements to the 30th September 1938.     The actual expenditure and the works to be carried out in each year are subject to the approval of the Treasury.I now ask the Cabinet to approve in principle the introduction &amp;  the Poet Office and.
