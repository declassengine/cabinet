(TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.^82It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.POSSIBLE MUTUAL GUARANTEE TREATY against air ATTACK.(Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)1. AT the meeting with M. Flandin and M. Laval to-day (Friday) a. situation was reached which compelled the meeting of the Cabinet specially summoned for to-morrow. It will be remembered that the French Ministers came over after agreement had been negotiated between the two Foreign Offices on a basis for discussion. The formula is in telegram No. 18 from Paris of the 29th January. But as the discussion to-day proceeded, it became obvious that the French Ministers were not able to accept the formula as it stood for the purpose of a public announcement, and that there was grave danger that this Franco-British meeting might end in a meaningless communique. This would be a disaster, and in view of the successful result of M. Laval&apos;s visit to Rome, a fiasco. But French Ministers (as we had reason to suspect) showed themselves greatly interested in a proposal for a new agreement, intended to be entered into by France, ourselves, Germany, Belgium and possibly Italy, for mutual protection against air attack. M. Laval produced a sketch of the sort of agreement which the French would be willing to make and wish us to approve. It is reproduced in Annex I.2.   On this scheme it should be particularly observed : (1) Unlike Locarno, it provides this country with a definite and immediate protection against the risk of air attack. It therefore is not open to&apos; the objection raised against Locarno that we are entering into commit-ments for the benefit of others. On the contrary, it is directly meeting the principal preoccupation of British opinion on the subject of danger from the air.(2) While the French commitment to us is plain and new, our obligations under the agreement really are in their nature the same obligations that have already been accepted under Locarno. The difference is that in the event of non-provoked aggression by air on France by Germany, we should be bound to intervene with our air force immediately.(3) It may be asked why the French should show themselves so eager to undertake new burdens if we are not really undertaking anything -new. The; answer seems to be that the French feel that they must , ; present to their public opinion a. new assurance in some detail from . us, even though, it is within our, Ldcarno commitments,. And of course, it is the fact that what wo are asked to do in return is more precise.[11124]
3. There is also attached (Annex-II) a draft which has been independently prepared by Sir William Malkin and which covers some points not mentioned in the French sketch. For example, shipping in home waters must be protected from aerial attack as well as the soil of the country itself. Again, it is important to make clear that the provisions of the new agreement would not apply in favour of a signatory which had gone to war in breach of its obligations.4. The Cabinet will certainly feel that details in various-connexions have to be thoroughly studied and worked out, but the immediate question is one of principle. Can we indicate to French Ministers before they return to Paris that His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the possibility of joining in an agreement on these lines with the other Powers named, and are prepared to enter into a study of its terms and methods without any delay ? M. Laval has offered to stay in this country longer than he had intended, say, until next Tuesday, in order that we may have the opportunity of considering what our answer will be to the French proposal.5. While this most important proposal must be considered on its merits, it is necessary to appreciate that unless we can give a favourable reply to the French suggestion, we are not going to get the French to adopt the formula recently discussed between us. The adoption of some such formula as a public declaration resulting from the present Anglo-French conference is the essential condition of an approach to Germany with any prospect of getting a successful issue. Even now, the chance may be slight (see Sir E. Phipps&apos;s telegram No. 31 of the 31st January), but it will make an enormous difference to public opinion and to the future if the advance is made, with the result that should Germany reject it, she will be in the wrong. If we make no effective advance, the German case is strengthened. And this appears to be absolutely the last time when such a procedure has any practical value. If we can get no terms with Germany, then we have to face rearmament on our own part on an increasing scale with financial burdens corresponding and with political results which need not be described.6. I therefore urge that we should give to the French Ministers an assurance in some such terms as are indicated above in paragraph 4. No one expects us to do more at this stage. But this will enable French Ministers to include in the declaration resulting from the present meetings, the offer of the abrogation of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles as one of the simultaneous terms of a general settlement. This is absolutely vital, as it seems to me, if our own attitude is to be justified and if agreement with Germany is to be possible.Foreign Office, February 1, 1935.
