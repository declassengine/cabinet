A 4&apos;i 9:THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. .. January 1935.SECRET.CP. 26 (35).CABINET.I ATTACH, for the information of my &quot;colleagues, a report by the Lord-Privy Seal on the present position in the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay, to which are added suggestions as to the action which His Majesty&apos;s Government should take in connexion with the embargo on the supply of arms (including aircraft) to the belligerents, as a result of recent developments at Geneva,J. S.Foreign Office, January 28, 1935.Bolivia-Paraguay Dispute.ON the 24th November last the Assembly of the League of Nations adopted a report, in accordance with the terms of Article 15 of the Covenant, laying down the lines on which the Assembly considers the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Chaco should be settled. This report was unconditionally accepted by the Bolivian Government on the 10th December, but it has not been accepted by the Paraguayan Government.In this report, the Assembly, inter alia, formally approved the embargo on the supply of arms (including aircraft) to Bolivia and Paraguay, the proposal for which was originally initiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. The report also provided for the setting up of an Advisory Committee, consisting of representatives of twenty-three States, to consider developments in the dispute, and also to advise as regards questions arising in connexion with the arms embargo. This Committee met at Geneva recently, and in view of the fact that Bolivia had accepted the report, whereas Paraguay had not done so, it was at once clear that there would be a practically unanimous demand for the raising of the embargo against Bolivia, and its application to Paraguay alone, pending acceptance by the latter. In order that the United Kingdom delegate should not find himself in a minority of one; he stated, under instructions, when the Committee met to consider a recommendation that the embargo should be raised against Bolivia, that, while he did not propose to take up a position against this, there were two matters as to which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would wish to be informed. The first was the attitude of States non-members of the League; the second was the efficacy of the embargo. As for the first, he pointed out that there was one State (the reference was to the United States) whose co-operation was indispensable to the embargo in any form, and, as for the second, he emphasised that it was essential that adequate steps should be taken to make the embargo completely effective. These stipulations were duly considered by the Committee, and account was taken of them in the report which was finally adopted unanimously on the 16th January. This report, which has been communicated to the Governments of the United States of America and Brazil as well as to the members of the League, states that the Advisory Committee, having regard to the situation obtaining in the dispute, considers that the7763   [11081]Copy No.    39
embargo on the supply of arms should not continue to be enforced against Bolivia. The report also recommends that Governments should (a) Supplement the measures already adopted with all other measures necessary to make the prohibition more effective, and, in particular, by prohibiting the re-export and the transport in transit of war material;(&amp;) Refrain from authorising the export of war material except to Govern-ments or to the accredited agents of Governments.In order that His Majesty&apos;s Government may not be accused of obstructing the activities of the League, it is considered that they should agree to act on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee in so far as may be open to them. It is proposed accordingly that they should, in reply to the Committee&apos;s communica-tion, state that they are prepared to accept and follow the Committee&apos;s recommendations, and enforce the embargo against Paraguay alone, provided that all the Governments whose co-operation, they stated, when the arms embargo was first agreed to, they regarded as essential, continue to enforce the embargo at any rate against Paraguay. This would include the United States and would mean that no objection would be raised if certain of these Governments continued to enforce the embargo against Bolivia as well, as indeed may well happen in the case of the United States Government.It is proposed that the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government should specifically state that their action in the present case must not be regarded as establishing a precedent. The reply should further state that the embargo which His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto enforced has specifically included re-exports, and that this would continue to be the case. The reply should add that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as unnecessary in their case to undertake an obligation to prevent transit, but that it is felt that the adoption of this measure by the limitrophe countries would be of great assistance. Finally, the reply should explain that it is the normal practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government not to issue licences for the export of arms except to Governments or the accredited agents thereof.A. E.Foreign Office, January 25, 1935.
