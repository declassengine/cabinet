It is right that the War Cabinet should realise the position, as in my opinion and in the opinion of my advisers, it is not satisfactory.     If the enemy made a determined effort;he could after tho end of November come out of the Dardanelles in excessive force at his selected moment, do great damage5 and then return to his bases.     The Lfist comparison of the Naval strengths involved is given in tho Table in paragraph IVjof the Memorandum attached.This state of affairs need not and should not oxi&amp;t if the Allied Naval Forces already in the Mediterranean were used, to the best and most economical advantage.   The only way that the British Admiralty can see of effecting an improvement in this respect is to press to a conclusion the negotiations which have for some time been proceeding, in order bo obtain the appointment of a British Admiral as Admiralissimo in the Mediterranean.     If this were done we should have gone a long way to obtain an improvement in the situation, but it is impossible for me or for the Admiralty to carry the negotiations further, as the obstacle to a settle:lent lies in the Authorities in Rome.   The only Members of the Italian Government who can deal with the matter are Signor Orlando and the Foreign Secretary.I therefore urge the War Cabinet to take up the - - -question through tho Foreign Office as one of urgency and of great importance.Sgd)   ERIC GEDDES.!
91 9   16SECRET.gho Black goa Fleets. Memorandum by. Secretary of the Allied Naval Council.Secretary, Alliod ITaval Council.I wish to have a Statement showing tho present composition of the Alliod Aegean Squadron,, and giving tho latest information in tho possession of the Allied Naval Council regarding the strength and composition of the Kusso-Turko-Gcrman Naval Forces in the Black Sea, and their state of preparedness. &apos;.E.G. GEDDES.24th Soptember 1918.First Lord.I. The full composition of the Allied Aegean Squadron is as follows:-GroatBritain    France.     Grooce.     Total.Battleships (Dread-nought) -8   (Pro-Dreadnought) 2 6-8Battlecruisers -Cruisers - 1             1Light Cruisers 4 - 1             5&apos;Destroyers 4 9 4            17Submarines ^2 9...                        11The above gives tho total forces, but a proportion of these ships are always away refitting and repairing. For example, at tho present timoll French Battleship and 4 French Destroyers are away from the Squadron for these purposes.In addition there are in the Aegean 8 French and Greek Destroyers of inferior armament (4 absent refitting) on escort duties, which with due notice right be assembled with tho Fleets in an emergency.Only efficient fighting ships are included, fit to meet the enemy,   and small destroyers, torpedo boats, etc.. for local defence purposes, and obsolete vessels are omitted.II.     The question of the Russo-Turko-German Forces in the Black Sea was under tho consideration of the Allied Naval Council at the recent Meetings, particulars having been obtained from each of the Countries regarding the information in their possession as to the composition and state of the Pusso-toko-German Forces.     Comparison of the particulars furnished by the several Countries, from their different sources of information, showed very close agreement, and the following statements may be accepted as approximately correct.
A. Russian Warships in Gor: an Hands at Sevastopol. ^______________________________Battleships (Dreadnought),       1u      (Pre-Dreadnought) , 4 modern&quot; 1 5 obsoleteCruisers........,. 2Destroyers   ........ 21 (4 damaged)Submarines........ 12 (modern)Submarines........ 4 (bbsolote).B. Russian Warships in Gorman Hands at Nicolaiev. _______________^__________________Battleships (Dreadnought) .      1 building, nearlycompleted.Light Cruisers......      1      1 1&quot; ,       8       ......      5 buildingSubmarines........      3 building, mearlycompletedSubinarinos....... .      3 building.1 2 6D. German Warships.It is believed that about 5 German Submarines are based on Constantinople and the Black Sea.III.     A number of tho Russian V/arships of modern types enumerated above were in a bad state of repair, but it is believed that the German firm of Ditto and Voss have taken over the Shipbuilding yards and it is known that a con-siderable number of workmen and specialist Naval ratings have been sent from Gcrmant to repair then    It is believed that the majority will be repaired by the end of November 1913.It is probable that, that the construction of the Dreadnought Battleship, 1 Light Cruiser and 3 Submarines now building at Nicolaiev will be completed in the course of a month or two. .The manning of the ships by Germany is not solely a question of Naval expediency, and the German Foreign Office is not in agreement with the German Naval Authorities, on the matter.     The Ukrainian claim to the Black Sea Fleet has caused difficulties and no settlement has been reached. Blit it is known that a considerable number of Officers, Warrant officers, Petty Officers and specialist ratings have i -already been sent from Germany to the Black Sea, and some complete crews for Submarines, and the unskilled portions of the crows of the larger ships could be completed with Russians, AustriansIXirks and Bulgarians.   The latest definite reports (June 19^.8) stated that the ships were not manned, but that German sentries were on board each ship*, But there would seem to bo no insuperable difficulty regarding the manning when the repairs are completed.-  &quot; &apos;   -        &quot; &quot; rv.0* Turkish Warhips (efficientBattieoruiser ....

IV.     A comparison of tho probabn strength of tho ftusso-Turko-Gorman Black Soa Forces, cppable of emerging from tho Dardanelles for action on tho High Sea. in the Mediterranean at the enemy1 s selected inoment after tho end of November of this year, with, the Allied Aegean Squadron, assuming tho latter at normal strength with, say, 1 Battleship, 1 Cruiser, 4 Destroyers and    3 submarines absent refitting, is therefore as followsDreadnought BattleshipsBattlecruisorsPro-Dreadnought BattleshipsCruisersLight CruisersDestroyersSubmarinesAllied Aegean     Combined . Squadron. Eno: y.-	...	1 or 2-	. * .	17	...	4r	...	44	...	1.15	...	23	. .	20V,     The Allied Naval Council understand that the British Aoaiiralty contemplate relieving the two British Pre*-Dreadnought Battleships in the Aegean by two Dreadnought typo before the end of-\this year, and that the question tif reinforcing the British Destroyers in the Spring of 1919 is under consideration.VI.     The decisions of the Allied Naval Council on these questions were as follows:-XGi -  The Naval Situation in the Black Sea,-A.   The Council having Considered the present position of the Gcr:rian-Turko-Russian Naval forces in the Black - . Sea, as shown in the Memoranda giving the latest informa-tion available on these matters, decided that it is ^essential to take every precaution to meet the menace of an exit of enemy Naval forces from the Dardanelles i , for offensive action in the Mediterranean,B,    .The -        . &apos; strengthening of, and additions to,tho Allied Aegean Squadron forecasted by the British Acb.iiraJ.ty were therefore viewed with great satisfaction and it was considered that the following additional measures should also now be taken: -0.     The Light Cruisers and Destroyers attached to tho Allied Aegean Squadron should be increased as soon as practiczble, and dofinite proposals for this purpose shall be put forward for consideration at the next Meetings of the Council.D. In order to guard against possibility of surprise, the Aerial Forces attached to the Allied Aegean Squadron should bo increased, and Groat Britain is requested to consider what reinforcemonts it may now be possible to provide.E, In view of the difficulty which is being experienced in obtaining reliable intelligence regarding Naval events in the Black Sea, and the necessity for securing timely information regarding enemy movements in this area, every effort should be made to organise an efficientIntelligence
jkIntelligence Sorvico at Constantinople, and also at more advanced bases in the Black Sea if possible, with reliable means of communication to one of the Allied Countries.     The Council desire that the Directors of Naval Intelligence of France, Great Britain, and Italy will confer together and concert such measures as may be found possible in order to achieve these objects to the fullest practicable extent.T.E,  CREASE.Captain R. N.Secretary, Allied Naval Councils24th September 1918.
