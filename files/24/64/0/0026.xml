(1).Reference No---- 18th September, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 17th September, 1918:-The Weather and Condition   of Crops, Harvest operations were seriously retarded in many parts of the country by the heavy rains which fell.during the past week.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Warwickshire *   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm of 170 acres at Stretton Baskerville on the border of Leicestershire which had been absolutely neglected by the owner occupier.   The whole of the labour employed by him is one soldier. Prosecutions.   In Oxfordshire a farmer near Bicester has been fined  25 for failure to comply with a notice to cultivate 15 acres of land, and in Worcestershire a similar fine has been inflicted on a farmer near Upton-on-Severn for failure to plough up 7 acres upon a farm of 300 acres, of which only 37 acres were arable. Determination of Tenancies.   During the week 2 orders have been made by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 654 acres.Drainage of Land. The following statement shows the principal schemes that have been completed or are being carried out under the powers conferred by Regulation 2M for the improvement of land drainage.
No account is taken of numerous smaller schemes which have been&apos; carried out in various parts of the country, but chiefly in the counties mentioned below.Bedfordshire , The cleansing and regrading of the River Ivel an being carried out by the work of prisoners of war and the gener; expenses (apart from labour) are being defrayed by the contributions of those interested. It is hoped that the execu of this scheme will benefit 4,000 acres, most of which is valu&amp;i agricultural land. More than 2,000 acres of this area are ara and will be immediately improved.Berkshire.   The cleansing is being carried out of a net-work Gil streams near Cholsey of which the Cholsey Brook constitutes thtl outfall.     The approximate area of agricultural land drained \M these streams is about 2,000 acres, of which 300 acres are at present arable and 450 acres swampy pasture. ICheshire.     The cleansing of the River Birkett and its tributail in the Wirrall Peninsula has been practically completed to thel consequent Improvement of 5,000 acres of land,    About 650 aera have already been brought under tillage and a considerable     j additional acreage can be ploughed when the land has been underB drained.    Work upon the Prodsham and Ince Marshes adjoining till Mersey is in course of execution, and it is hoped that 4,000 em of agricultural land, of which at least 1,000 acres will be frlj for arable cultivation, will be improved thereby.     Work has ti commenced on the River Gowey, the area concerned being about  j 2,000 acres.     All these schemes are being carried out by prisoners of war. jCambridgeshire. The River Mel has been cleansed for a length I cf 2 miles and about 300 acres of land have been Improved * m Work is proceeding on the Isleham Fen with the aid of prisoners of war, and (so far as it is complete) 1,300 acres have been1 I
greatly Improved.      The Committee are now dealing with a further 1,500 acres in the same fen, and when the whole scheme has been completed about 3,800 acres will have been improved.   The arable land included in this area is approximately 1,300 acres. Cumberland.   In this county,, the Committee have been successful in causing numerous becks and water-courses to be cleansed by the ad-joining occupiers either voluntarily or under compulsory trders. 115 different streams or water-courses have been dealt with for a total length of 130 miles.    Six more of these water-oourses have now been taken in hand.Essex. Work is being carried&apos;out on the Mardyke and its tributary streams by prisoners of war.    The total area which will be benefited by this scheme is approximately 17,000 acres of which more than 7,000 are now arable.   The total length of the channels draining this area is 24 miles, and in June last 15 miles remained to be cleansed. Work has been proceeding actively since that time but figures of the actual length now completed are not available. Lancashire, The Glazebrook, a tributary of the Mersey, has been cleansed by the voluntary action of those interested under the auspices of the Committee, and to the improvement of an area of 4,000 acres actually liable to floods.   Work is proceeding upon the cleansing of the River Douglas, the Committee exercising for this purpose the powers of the Croston Drainage Commission who have jurisdiction over a portion of the valley extending to about 3,000 acres.   In addition to this area another 2,000 acres will be 1m-proved by the work.Norfolk.   The work of cleansing the Waveney above tidal limits has been half completed and 5,000 acres will be improved by the scheme as a whole.   The net-work of channels draining into Burnham Harbour has been cleansed to the improvement of about 2,000 acres of land; about half of this acreage has been practically reclaimed. A similar scheme is in progress upon a series of channels having outfall into the Wash near Snettisham.      The cleansing Of the River Thet has been almost completed and that of
the River Wennum and the Aldborough Beck&quot;are well in hand. Work\ the Wensum, Yare and Tas has recently been commenced. The work up all these schemes is being carried out by prisoners of war. No definite information is available as to the acreages to be improve except in the case of the flaveney. The cleansing of the Bure fros its tidal limit at Coltishall to its source was carried out in 19] and about 2,000 acres benefited therepy, the greater part of which Is pasture land.Lincolnshire (Lindsay). Work is -proceeding upon the Upper or Soutf Ancholme and its tributary channels as a result of which it should possible to bring into cultivation about 1,200 additional acres oi land.Yorkshire (North Riding). The cleansing of the River Poss close to York was completed in 1917, and that of its tributary the Tang Ha] Beck and of the River Kyle in the same neighbourhood has now been almost completed. The cleansing of the Ellerker and Walmouth Becks! been completed in 1918.   Work 13 proceeding upon the River Wiske J the Bedale Beck which are tributaries of the Swale, and has been I recently commenced upon the Swale itself. Work is also proceeding the Nath Beck a tributary of the Ure, and upon the Severn one of t upper feeders of the Derwent.   Information is not available as to the acreages benefited by these schemes.(East Riding), The Market Weighton Canal has been cleansed and its water level lowered so that the mouths of many of the drains falli into it have been uncovered for the first time for many years. Tb staunch where the River Foulnees debouches into the canal has been! lowered but the Committee are waiting until they can be supplied n prisoner labour in order to carry out the cleansing of the river i of which the canal forms the lower reach. The whole of this scheme when completed will Improve an area of more than 10,000 acres. T Committee have,also cleansed other channels falling into the Humbe from the north, including the Bellasiae Drain and the Greenoak Ooim 4 &quot;*
Work is being carried out on the Howden Dyke Drain.   The precise acreages benefited are not available.   The Committee have also arranged for the Wilberfoss and Thornton Drainage Board, an authority recently established, to carry -out improvements which are necessary as an emergency measure, pending the carrying out of the Drainage Board&apos;s more comprehensive scheme, upon the Blackfoss Dyke and Sails Beck which are tributaries of the Derwant. (West Riding), The West Moor and Park Drains in HatfieId Chase have been cleansed and an area of 3,327 acres improved and 700 acres reclaimed thereby.   The cleansing of drains near Tickhill has resulted in the improvement of 2,750 acres and the reclamation of 100 acres.   Work has been carried out at Aukley Bridge to the improvement of 2,000 acres.   The Committee have now in hand the improvement and cleansing of channels in the Thorne area which it is estimated will improve 13,000 acres of land, and the improvement, of a length of the old channel of the River Don, a work that will benefit 40,000 acres.   The chief features of the work in West Riding are the small expense at which it has been carried out and the great value of the improvements obtained, especially at West Moor and Tickhill.Westmorland.   The obstruction to the outfall of G$asmere Lake caused by an accumulation of debris has been carried out at a small expense, and the agricultural land surrounding the lake has been freed from water-logging.Wales,. Anglesey.   The cleansing and improvement of the channels draining the Malltraeth Marsh are being carried out by the aid of prisoners of war.   Only a portion of the marsh is under the jurisdiction of a drainage authority.   The total area of the water-shed is about 30,000 acres of which about 6,000 acres were seriously water-logged or practically derelict.   It is hoped that the whole of this latter area will be benefited by the scheme and 4,000 acres added to the agricultural land of the county.
-Denbighshire ft Flintshire,     The improvement of the Rhuddlan Marsh has now been carried out with the result that about 600 acres werd made available for corn in 1918 that would otherwise not have been ploughed.    By the scheme as a whole about 2,000 acres&apos;&quot; will be directly benefited and 2,500 acres indirectly benefited, Flintshiref   The Committee are carrying out work on water-courses draining lrnd immediately behind the high sea-shore at Rhyl and (it Prestatyn which will result in the improvement of 1,000 to 1,200 acres of land.Merionethshire^   After difficult and protracted negotiations the Committee have induced the owners of the adjoining estates to dreo at their own cost the mouth of the Fiver Dysynny which is obstruct by a bank of hard-core.    The department agreed to supply labour to&apos; a value equivalent to that of the dredging work for the cleans! of the upper river in the first instance.     The Cralnage Board (who have no jurisdiction over the river but only over the adjoin! land) are now putting their own channels in order.    It is hoped! the result of this operation will be to Improve and render avails! for ploughing more than 1,000 acres of valuable land,-   The fact that this land was rendered useless by the neglect of the drainage channels has been a considerable obstacle to the increase of cultivation in this and adjoining counties.HORTICULTURAL DIVISIONiProvision of Land for Allotments,    Reports received from 1,190 districts show that 316,980 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No,2) and that 292,051 plots containing 21,165 acres have been provided.&apos; During the week five Local Authorities have agreed to acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, 28 acres (349 i allotments), including an additional lli acres at Bicester.
At St. Neot&apos;s (Hunts.) 75$ of the 1,008 house-holders possess gardens of from 5 to 10 poles each, and In addition about 51b aores of allotments are being cultivated by 268 parishoners.In the parish of Great Shelford (Oambs.) 308 house-holders are cultivating an aggregate of 26 acres bf allotments.     In addition at least 50$ of the householders possess gardens large enough to supply their own needs 4The Somerset Agricultural Executive Committee have obtained a detailed report on the allotments provided by that bommittee under Regulation 2M in twenty-nine parishes.    The acreage Of which possession was taken was 7lf acres, about 7 acres of which have been restored to the owners after arrangements had been made for a direct tenancy.   The total number of plots provided was 742, of which all but 71 were let at the date of the report.   The majority of the plots are between 10 and 20 perches, and the average rent charged is from 6d. to 9d. per perch.   Almost without exception the plots have been highly productive, and in respect of the main food crops, the newly turned-up grass lands are stated to have been equal to and even better than the older allot-ments.   In some cases the land was :in a very dirty and neglected condition when taken over, but has been brought into an excellent state of cultivation. FRUIT SECTION.46 demonstrations in the methods of preservation of fruit and vegetables have been held during the week, and special exhibitions have been held at Exeter, Chatham, Clapham, Bury St. Edmund&apos;s, Leeds and Southend-on-Sea,Greasebanding demonstrations have been held during the week at Bury St. Edmund1 a, Mildenhall, Branden and Sudbury.Demonstrations and lectures on the keeping of bees have been given at Royston and Hampstead, and the new leaflet &quot;Building up Nuclei into Strong Stocks for Overwintering&quot; has been issued. Poultry.   Many inquiries are being received on the subject of Poultry food which is the limiting factor in Poultry keeping.
TECHNICAL DIVISION. Reduction of Sheep Flocks.    Enquiry is being made as to the exaj causes for the reduction of sheep flock3 in certain districts in West of England, e.g. the Cotswold Hills,     The question is imporj in its bearing on the maintenance of the corn acreage, and It is hoped that^/the information obtained as a result of the enquiry it will be possible to frame a definite policy in regard to the maintenance of live stock.Laying of Corn Crops, An enquiry is being addressed to Agricult Organisers and the authorities of Agricultural Institutions, askl them for information which will form a basis for research and experiment into the laying of corn crops. Very little informatl is. available at present on this subject, which is a matter of grt economic importance.Conservation of Nitrogen by the Use of Leguminous Plants. Ihe shortage of.nitrogenous fertilisers makes it necessary to examine all possible sources of nitrogen likely to be available, Agrici has an enormous potential supply of nitrogen in the leguminous fc crops, but unfortunately they cannot altogether be relied upon as they are liable to &quot;sickness&quot;. The problem of &quot;clover sickness&quot; a difficult one. This subject is under consideration at Rothams from the point of view of bacterial inoculation, and will shortly It Is hoped, be studied by a plant pathologist. In the meantime consideration is being given to modifications of the rotations of crops customary in districts affected by clover sickness, in orde to secure for leguminous plants a larger place in the rotation an at the same time to minimise the risk of sickness by the groving seeds mixtures containing relatively immune plants.
LABOUR DIVISION. Agricultural Labour and Military Service.    The Agricultural. Executive Qommittees have been much concerned at the possibility of having to find further men upon the conclusion of the harvest for the purpose of making up the full 30,000 men which it was decided should be found for the Army from Agriculture..    It has now been decided^ however, that no further demand for men for military service shall be made from the agricultural industry on the quota system.This concession will not mean the cessation of reoruitmmt from agriculture.    Agricultural Executive Committees will release all men they consider can be spared, and such men will be posted for service after the 1st October.    A small number of men who had been called up fpr military service before the 26th June last, when agricultural recruitment was stopped, but whose calling up notices were suspended In order to allow them to assist with the harvest, will be required to join the Forces after the 1st October.It has been decided that any further recruiting scheme applicable to Wales will be determined locally between the Director of National Service for Wales and the County Agricultural Executive Committees concerned.Conferences have been held with the Ministry of National, Servioe and the Local Government Board with regard to an extension of the list of occupations in respect of which County Agricultural Executive Committees may be authorised to issue vouchers protecting the holders from military service.    An agreement has been arrived at which covers practically all the trades ancillary to agriculture, and instructions on the lines of this agreement are being prepared. Kitchen Gardeners and Military Service.   In connection with the arrangement that kitchen gardeners are to be dealt with by x,he
tribunals and not by the County Agricultural Executive Committee the Local Government Board are calling the attention of tribunal to the importance of maintaining the kitchen gardens of private households t     The Local Government Board have issued instruction! to all tribunals that exemption should generally not be refused to an experienced kitchen gardener whose exemption is found to be essential for the production of large quantities of necessary food supplies.Harvest Labour.     The number of soldiers specially released for harvest work and, now out on farms is 8,811.     In addition, abou 4,500 prisoners of war specially loaned for such^work are employ in the harvest fields.     Owing to the delay caused to harvesting operations in the northern and midland counties by Inclement weather, the military authorities have agreed to extend the furl of the soldiers of Home Forces from six weeks to. two months in districts where the harvest is not yet completed. Soldier Labour on Farms.     The War Office have agreed to postpom until the 15th October the withdrawal of Category &quot;a&quot; soldiers employed on farms in England and Wales who-are experienced farm labourers.     The withdrawal of these soldiers&apos; would cause serious disturbance at the commencement of the autumn cultivations, as a large number of the .men are ploughmen and.have been with their present employers for many months. This concession has, therefore, been granted in order that substitutes may be provided to take the place of &quot;a&quot; men before they are actually withdrawn from agriculture.WOMEN&apos;S BRANCH. Employment.     The demand for women milkers is increasing, particularly in Buckingham and Somerset.Potato camps are being started this week in Llncolnshi but on a smaller scale than was originally intended as it has been impossible to remove 70 women employed in flax-pulling intSomerset owing to scarlet fever having broken out in   the camp.1*&apos; &quot;    &apos;   - 10 - 1
7vSThere are practically..no members of the Women&apos;s Land&apos;Army out of employment at the present time.   The women shewn in the weekly returns as &quot;in depots&quot; are only there for one or two days while waiting for posts, or being transferred from one place to another.CULTIVATION DIVISION. Tractor Scheme.   The following statement shews the position with regard to the provision of tractors, machinery and implements forthe week ended 14th SeptemberNo. consigned   Total No. during week.    with counties.Tractors 124 5,988Ploughs 132 . 5,087Up to the 14th September 2,152 of the Fordson Trectors released to Messrs. Henry Ford &amp; Son had been despatched to farmers.During the week ended 30th August 8,594 acres were ploughed, 978 acres were cross-ploughed and 3,556 acres were cultivated by Government Tractors.Horse Scheme.   Steps are being taken to protect horses owned by the Department from attacks of parasitic mange during the coming winter, and also to provide.for the adequate treatment of existing cases. Steam Tackle.   The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows:-   ploughed 3,906 acres, cultivated 27,672 acres, harrowed 918 acres, Total 32,496 acres.Arrangements for 1918 Harvest.   It is not anticipated that there will be any further demand for binders this season.   The final position is that, 4,220 binders have been supplied to Executive Committees, 524 have been released for private sale, and 264 are on hand..   Reports shew that the Departments binders.have been of the greatest assistance throughout the country.   During the week ended 30th August the binders employed with tractors did 5,119 days&apos; work and, in addition, a large amount of work.was done with horses.327 threshing machines have been supplied to counties to date while 80 have been released for sale to threshing contractors.
The effect of the threshing organisation instituted by Ithe Department is now being disclosed.   In the majority of count!the system of allocating definite areas to each machine availablebeen adopted and while there have been a few cases of friction andifficulty there appears to be every prospect that the scheme wilwork well. In most counties- the Threshing Sub-Committee have nowable to arrange with the contractors a fixed charge for threshingWhere there were difficulties in adjusting the rate as betweencontractors and farmers the matter has In nearly every instance\arranged and only two or three cases are outstanding.   Difficult!with regard to labour and coal continue, but various devices sucllthe employment of gangs of women and in some instances prisoners!war are being adopted to overcome the former, while it is hoped!!Ithe scheme for Coal supply recently.arranged will gradually overt the coal shortage.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers.   The deliveries of sulphate of ammonia in the first three months of the present season were 51,450 tons, as against 40,300 tons in the same period last year.   The output has recentl been reduced by about 500 tons per week owing to the increased requirements for munitions.   The deliveries of basic slag in the three months, June - August, were 131,700 tons as against 91,700 tons during the same period last year.An agreement has now been come to with the Potash Prodn tion Department whereby muriate of potash from the Oldbury factor will be sold partly to fertiliser makers for inclusion in their compound manures and partly to farmers for use on the potato and flax crops. The output of the factory is uncertain but may amour to 2,500 tons per annum, of which 1,500 tons will be available fo distribution in England and Wales.Insecticides.   The demand for nicotine is increasl^ owing to tW shortage of quassia, while at the same time the output is falli off on account of the calling up for service of a few trained me
who cannot be replaced.   It is hoped that some of these may be released. Prices for next season have been agreed with the makers, who have undertaken to produce as large a quantity as possible. Wire Netting and Corrugated Sheets.   Owing to the demands of the Army the supply of wire netting for agrixrulture has recently- decreased, -but it is hoped to secure a renewal of the former allocation of 150 tons per month.Very little corrugated sheeting has been available for, agriculture for some time, but an allocation of 100 tons per month has now been promised.   It is proposed to distribute both these supplies through Agricultural Executive Committees. Importation,of Seed Peas and Beans.   The Ministry of Food, at the suggestion of this Department, have made an amending Order to the Beans, Peas and Pulse (Requisition) Order,&apos; 1917, excepting seed beans and peas from the provisions of the Order.Seed Wheat Scheme.   The first deliveries of &quot;Browiok&quot; for distribution under this scheme have already been made and the wheat was found to be in excellent condition.Wart Disease.   Carnarvon, Flint and Merioneth have been certified as Infected Areas - Rpm the purposes of the Wart Disease of Potatoes Order of 1918.   Farm lands in these counties will not be affected by the certificates until the 1st June 1919, but in the case of all other lands the certificates will take effect at once.Potato Spraying.   Potato blight has been very severe in Anglesey and Carnarvon this season.   At Truro, where the Cornwall Executive Committee recently lifted some of their potatoes, the sprayed area gave an increased yield of 30 cwts. per acre as compared with the unsprayed area.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
