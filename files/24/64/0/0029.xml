)perty 0&apos;V 9MINISTRY OF SUPPING&apos;.aSEAMEN1S WAGES AND THE EFFECT OF THERECENT AMERICAN ADVANCE IN PAY.5f tf&apos;       Memorandum by the Chairman of the National Maritime Board,Trouble has arisen in some of our ports as a direct result of the recent big advance in American seamen&apos;s wages arid as the matter is possibly fraught with serious consequences to the entire labour situation in the United Kingdom it is- thought well to bring it to the attention of the War Cabinet.In the fall of last year the wages of a British A.B. varied considerably between port and port, being at Liverpool  8, 10s. per month, and on the Tyne  10, per month, (The pre-war rate was about  5, 10s. per month).   American A,B&apos;s were getting 12. per month plus a 50 per cent, bonus for vessels trading in the war zone, making  18. per month. Thus, an English A,3.,signing articles at Liverpool was getting less than one half the American wage.In these circumstances, coupled with the high rates of remuneration to be obtained in American shore employment, desertions from our ships in American ports became rife, lilfbeii: these desertions occurred, British shipmasters found them-selves compelled to sign on American seamen at the American rate to work their ships back to England, and it thus came about that on the same ship crossing the Atlantic there often worked side by side an English seaman at  8. 10s, and an American seaman at  18, a contrast which was often accentuated by theamerican seaman being so inefficient that the British seamen had largely to do his work for him.   Acute dissatisfaction followed and trouble on a big scale was threatened.   The trouble was fomented by the striking appeals of the leaders of the American Seamen&apos;s Union, who printed special leaflets urging British and
other seamen not to play the blackleg in American ports by working for less than the American standard pay.In October 1917 a strike broke out at Liverpool at the very time that the National Maritime Board was being established by the Ministry of Shipping, (anticipating the lines of the Whitley Councils,) to deal with wages and conditions in the mercantile marine.   A deputation of the disaffected men, together with the leaders of the Sailors * and Firemens&apos; Union, was received at the Ministry of Shipping and it was found impossible to resist the merits of the seamen1s case.   The strike was immediately brought to an end by the concession of an interim standard wage, pending the first meeting of the National Maritime Board, of  11. per month for A.B.fs.   Subsequently the National Maritime 3oard increased this to  11. 10s (53/- per week) for A.B&apos;s and  12. (55/4 per week) for firemen, and in the period that has elapsed proportionate increases have been given to other ranks including stewards, deck officers and engineer officers Thus, standard wages become for the first time established in the British mercantile marine.   Hhlle these decisions were precipitated by the Liverpool strike, it would not be right or fair-to say that the standard wages are in any way disproportionate to the services performed.It may be pointed, out, however, that the Railway Executive Committee have expressed the opinion that the corresponding standard wage in the coasting trade, viz:- 3: 17: 6d per week, for seamen on weekly boats, (in this case finding their own food), is unduly high, and only with reluctance did they consent to recognise the standard wage.It may fairly be said that general content followed the determination by the National Maritime Board of standard rates of pay for the officers and seamen of the British Mercantile Marine,    Unfortunately, however, a new factor of
extreme importance was introduced when, on May 4th. 1910, the United States National Shipping Board raised the American standard to 75 dollars per month plus 50 per cent, for war zone trading, or about  23. per month.   This  23,   is twice the standard wage as established by the British National Maritime Board,   By July symptons of unrest again appeared in the British Mercantile Marine and desertions In American ports which had fallen once more increased.   The old story was repeated and again we have a situation in which men desert when they reach America, to have their places taken by American seamen earning twice the British wage.   This has resulted in appeals for an increase in the British standard wage, and at the end of August, 1918, the District Secretary of the Sailors&apos; and Firemen1s Union received a round robin from the crews of the ships of an incoming Atlantic convoy demanding the American wage by October 1st.   On September 4th the Swansea branch of The Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union passed a resolution asking for a fifty per cent, advance in wage, the demand being based upon the higher wages paid to American and Scandinavian seamen.   On September 17th a meeting of seamen was held in Southampton to discuss the matter.     It is the fact that Scandinavian seamen, like American seamen, are very much higher paid than ours.   For example, the Norwegian seamen gets  15. per month as compared with the American  23, and the British  11, 10s.   Of course, the Scandinavian shipowner is making very high profits and can easily afford to pay such a wage.It should be pointed out with regard to Americanseamen&apos;s standard wages that the war zone bonus only affects seamen sailing on the Atlantic side, and that in the Pacific the American seamen gets not  23. per month but  17. 10c. per month.   Ever this  17: 10s, however, Is fifty per cent, greater
than our standard wage.   Another point of importance is that American transports are manned by naval ratings at tho ordinary naval rate of pay; the proportion of American tonnage so manned is believed to be one-sixth.   The American naval rate of pay is  8 per month, or about what our merchant seamen received last October.   -There is no doubt that American shipowners do not view with disfavour the raising of wages in the British Mercantile Marine and that they are hardly likely to be out of sympathy with the new demand of the British seamen.   It cannot be expected that the American Government should particularly interest itself in the preventing the desertion of seamen who are paid  11. 10s, while their own seamen are paid  23,   The International Seamen&apos;s Union of America are active in circulating literature calculated to encourage British seamen to raise their demands.   At the end of May 1918 the American Senate helped the Union by printing as an official document an article entitled &quot;American Sea Power and the Seamen&apos;s Act&quot;, which is prefaced as follows by Mr. Andrew Puruseth, the President of the international Seamen&apos;s Union oi&apos; America:-&quot;The seamen&apos;s act is strongly contested by GovernmentsTilt-1 CxGof foreign nation^, who havej/urgent appeals to our Government to suspend or at least modify some of Its to them most irksome provisions.   Our Government has, according to report, answered that the remedy is in their own hands.   Pay the same wages as that pajd in American ports and give to the men such reasonable treatment as will induce the men to remain with tneir vessels and the desertions will practically cease.&quot;The struggle has shifted to the American courts. Foreign shipowners or, in some instances, foreign Governments are employing American attorneys and are contesting the act not only in the district courts but in all appellate courts.   British
Q 9 Odinterests or the British Government is employing the law firm of Frederick C, Coudert, Howard Thayer Kingsbury, who appears for the British consuls as amlcus curlae.   The seamen respectfully request,-through, the undersigned, that the following be made into a Senate document.Respectfully submitted,(Signed) ANDREW FURUSETH, President International Seamen&apos;s Union of America,The document itself lays stress upon the fact of the Amerioan Seamen1s Act in, to quote Its own language, &quot;ett &quot;effectuating the purpose of congress in equalizing the wage cost in foreign and domestic vessels&quot;.The merits of the menfs cose have to be considered not only in relation to the American wage but in relation to British shore labourA      I am Informed that whereas the British A,3, gets  11. 10s, per month, or 53s, per week, casual dock labourers are earning 10s. to 12/6 per day, boiler stokers in engineering and other trades 55s, to 60s, per weeki unskilled labourers in coal mines 45s, to 65s, per week, and building labourers in large towns 53/- to 63s, per week.   Moreover the shore men earn overtime pay whereas there Is no overtime pay for a seaman save in port, although he may be called upon at any hour. Against this it should be remembered that the seamen is fed by his employer and if we take the value of the food at 21s, , per week (the valuation adopted by the National Maritime Board) then the A.B. gets not 53s, but 74s, per week.   The fact that the seaman is found in food, however, is hound up with the spec5.al character of his employment, with its   peculiar hardships, denials, perils of the sea accentuated by the conditions of war, and old and new war risks.   The landsman19 wage is for 5j days&apos; work; the seaman necessarily works 7 days per week.   It canhardly
hardly be said, therefore, that the seaman receives any very special recognition of hi3 work or that he is overpaid.    Even if we have no regard to the American wage, the comparisons that have been made are with unskilled shore employment.    If, of course, tho comparison had been made with skilled employment, the seamen&apos;s remuneration would compare very unfavourably.It is clear, however, that the present trouble arises not from dissatisfaction with the wage from the domestic point of view, but solely from the May increase in the American standard rates.    The question Is whether, if an advance is made in the British standard rates, or If a special war risk bonus of the American pattern is introduced, the demand for a similar rise will spread to shore employments.    It has been already pointed out (paragraph 5) that the Railway Executive Committee considered that even the existing standard x^ates for,weekly boats are excessive, and it is true that they expressed the fear that the concession would lead to demands for extra wages in railtray employment as soon a3 the standard seamen&apos;s wage became operative for the men of the railway weekly boats.    This fear has not been realised, and it is notable that in the new demand for a rise In pay made by the rail-way men the Railway Unions ignore the seamen&apos;s wage altogether, and specify three grounds for their demand. (1)   The rise in the cost of living,(2) TThe recent award of the Committee on Production in theengineering end foundry trades, and (3)   The increased bonus recently given to the miners.Nevertheless, it is very important to give full consider-ation to the possible reaction upon shore wages of any further advance in seamen&apos;s pay.    What the war done in building up a big American mercantile marine is to bring American rates of wages, which are much higher than ours, right home to the shores of the United Kingdom.    The striking contrast between British and American wages is placed in a concrete form plainly before British seamen.If/
If there were a big strike on the question, this   same contrast would be brought under the direct attention of the whole of our working classes, and in that case, as It seems to me, nothing could prevent an all-round demand for something approaching American pay.    On the other hand, If, before the matter has proceeded further, and before any actual stoppage of work has occurred, the seamen are given a specific war zone bonus, then it seems to me that the specific character of the award is not likely to make it a ground for shore demands.    There is probably room here, however, for considerable difference of opinion, and the issue must depend upon how and when the thing is done.While the payment of a specific war zone bonus is in the. circumstances : &apos;-s commended by the Ministry of Shipping for consideration, it is submitted that it mast be accompanied by measures to deal with the question of desertion in American ports. Otherwise there would be a continuance of conditions which provoke seamen to demand the American wage.    The Ministry of Shipping has been for some time pressing the Admiralty to provide a reserve in America of a small number of naval ratings for the purpose of making substitution in any cases of desertion which occur in American ports.    The Admiralty has so far refused the request mainly on the ground of the shortage of men.    The number of men asked for, however, is only 250, and it is suggested that the evil aimed at is so great that the War Cabinet would be warranted in asking the Admiralty to furnish this small amount of man-power. A suggestion has been made that the difficulty could equally be met by providing five per cent, of surplus labour on all ships trading to American ports.    This,&apos; however, would waste a larger amount of man-power as the number of men required would be nearly BOO.If it is held that there should be a refusal of theseamenfs demands because it is not wise to risk the reaction ofan advance upton shore labour and the general wage position in theUnited Kingdom, then there is nothing for it but to face thequestion/
bhquestion of manning ocean-going vessels with enlisted men. However, naval ratings are not available to do the thing on the large scale which would then be effective.   To wait for Sectional strikes to develop and then to break.them by using naval ratings would be a dubious expedient and one which might lead to the most serious consequences here, to say nothing of its effect upon public opinion in America.     In this connection it may be remarked that the men of the Royal Ifevy are also asking for better conditions.113. On Sept. 11th the Seamen&apos;s representatives on the NationalMaritime Board (Sailors1 and Firemen&apos;s Panel) gave notice to raise the question here discussed.    A special meeting of the Board was convened on Monday Sept. 16th to consider it,    Mr. Havelook Wilson, the General President of the Seamen&apos;s Union, who rarely attends the Board, was present.    At the conclusion of a long discussion the following resolution was moved by Mr. Watts for the Shipping Federation:That, having regard to the fact that American wages have always been higher then the wages paid in the United Kingdom and also to the fact that seamen who are natives of neutral countries such as Norway and Sweden have not the same Interest in winning the war as British seamen, that the rates paid to American or neutral seamen have no&apos; bearing upon the British rates.This resolution was seconded by iAr. Have lock vVilson but opposed by all of his five colleagues.     It was carried by six votes to five, the majority of six being composed of &amp;r* Have lock1Wilson and the fiv^e employers, while the minority of five was composed of the five other representatives of the Seamen&apos;s Union, iiir. Have lock Wilson spoke very strongly against any   increase, and said that it was the duty of the Government /to make a stand. 5$        He characterised the seamen&apos;s demand as extortionate and said that if acceded to other demands of the same kind would follow.Mr./
Mr. Watts for the shipowners said that Mr, Havwlock Wilson had&apos;-stated his case for him; the Board had established a national standard wage for the war period and it was the duty of the Government to maintain it.    He also said that he would conscript the seamen.    Mr. Havelock Wilson agreed &quot;with him. his followers dissenting.On the following day, (Sept. 17) a private conference (in which the Government took no part) was held which was attended by Mr. Watts, Mr. Laws and Mr. Glover of the Shipping Federation, and By Mr. Havelock  Wilson and Father Hopkins of the Seamenfs Union.    At this conference Mr. V/ilson and the shipowners, while still maintaining their attitude as to the merits of the case, reluctantly agreed that, if the Government did not feel Itself in a position to fight the men, and advance must be granted. (Mr. Havelock Wilson added a proposal that the Government should form a reserve of seamen by calling men from the Army who had been seafarers).    The advance contemplated appears to have been  4 per month, which would raise the A.B&apos;s. wage to  15. 10s. per month as compared with the American  23.    This attitude on the part of the shipowners was subetabtially maintained at a conference at the Ministry of Shipping on Wednesday, Sept. 18th at which the Shipping Controller took the chair.The Government has before it other demands for Increases by large sections of labour. The railwaysnen are asking for 10s. per week, which is  2. 3s. 4d. per month. The transport workers are asking for the following advances:4d. per hour for day workers.6d. per hour for night workers100 per cent, for piece workers This means a demand for prabably about  4. 10s. per month.    These workers, whatever the merits of their case, have not to face the very real war risks of the seaman1s calling.
1     0 0 0 016. The Shipping Controller has used his influence with theShipping Federation to deal further with the matter at the National Maritime Board, in the hope that he may receive from it such a recommendation a3 he could accept on behalf of the Government.    It is the purpose of this memorandum to ask the consideration of the following proposals by the War Cabinet:(a) The payment to our seamen of all ranks of a war zone bonus, the national standard rates of pay remaining as determined by the National Maritime Board, (The cost of such an increase as is suggested in Paragraph 14 would be approximately  10,000,000 a year)(b) The establishment in American ports of a reserve of naval ratings to furnish substitutes for deserters .from British ships.Having regard to the increase, in the cost of living since the national standard wage for seamen was established in October 1917, and assuming that a substantial advance is about tobe conceded to railway men and to other transport workers, it may be found possible to justify a further advance to seamen without bringing into consideration at all the question of the American rate.    The point whether an advance should be described specifically as a War Zone Bonus is, perhaps, a question of expediency.L. Co M.September 18th 1918.
