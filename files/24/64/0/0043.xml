3. Wart Disease of Potatoes (Scotland) Order of 1918.

In order the more readily to prevent the spread of Wart Disease of Potatoes the Board have issued a new Order under the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts 1877 and 1907. By this Order restrictions supplementary to those already in force have been imposed on the planting of potatoes, other than varieties known to be immune to Wart Disease, in any land less than half an acre in extent situated in an area certified by the Board to be infected with Wart Disease. By the operation of this Order the Board hope to be able more effectively to control the disease, - which, in Scotland, has mainly affected small gardens and allotments, - without restricting unduly the operations of farmers, who are as a rule sufficiently aware that it is in their own interests to prevent the spread of Wart Disease. In the schedule to the Order the following areas are certified to be "infected areas" :-

(1) An area comprising the administrative Counties of Kinross and Clackmannan, and certain Parishes in the Counties of Stirling, Linlithgow, Dumbarton and Renfrew, with the Burghs of Stirling, Falkirk, Linlithgow, Dumbarton, Renfrew and Paisley;

(2) An area comprising certain Parishes in the Counties of Ayr and Dumfries, and the Burghs of Ayr, Irvine, Kilmarnock and Sanquhar;

(3) An area comprising certain Parishes in the County of Dumfries, and the Burgh of Dumfries;

(4) An area comprising certain Parishes in the Counties of Dumfries and Roxburgh; and

(5) An area comprising certain Parishes in the County of Midlothian, and the Burgh of Musselburgh.

The Board may from time to time certify further areas to be "infected areas" for the purposes of the Order, and it is proposed to communicate with the Local Authorities for the Counties of Fife, Perth and Lanark, by whom Inspectors have been appointed for the administration of the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts, as to the application of the Order to certain areas in those Counties.

The Wart Disease of Potatoes (Scotland) Order of 19l3 has been revoked, but its provisions have in the main been embodied in the new Order.

Ill, OP DISCHARGED SQLPIJSR3 AMD SAILORS.GARJEflHG.In March the Board circulated to Local War Pensions Committees particulars of schemes prepared by them for the training of ex-service men in market gardening (1) in private gardens, (2) in market gardens, (3) at Cornton Vale Colony.From roporte received the Board understand that practic-:ally no demand has so far been made by men for such training. At Corxtton Vale, for example, only three men have taken the course.    The Board have no definite statistics as to ths number of men placed in, private gardons since the arrangements for this part of the scheme are in the hands of the Pensions Committews. Before reconsidering the scheme the Board have communicated again with Pensions Committees drawing attention to the scheme and re-:questing a report on its working during the past 6 months.
