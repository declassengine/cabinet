(This Docnt*er&apos; is the PropariyofJ&apos;&quot; His Britannic i   iesty&apos;8 Government.)9.8COTTON IKPQRTp. morandum by the President of the Board of Tradell* In his Memorandum for the War Cabinet on tte imoortationof feeding stuffs dated August 22nd,1918 (G.T.5474) tte Pood Controller strongly urges &quot;that animal fooda should tako procodonoo of raw materials for civilian trades, suoh as laaihor and textiles&quot;. m present position of tho imports referred to is:-LeatherCottonWoolAll other TextilesImport January-Augist1918.441,000 147,000 185.000Bate of import per annumm662;000 320;000 277,000Total of the ma toria lo referred to by tho Pood Controller for the eight months is 793,(000 tons or a rate of 1,189,000 tons a year.But only a portion of this import is in any proper sense for &quot;civilian trades&apos;.  Leather and all textiles out Cotton and Silk aro under War Office control.  The weight of &amp; Ik io negligible.   The amounts of imported leather, flax, jute am heap which can ho allowed by th3 War Departments to bo used for any but tho most essential rational nooas aro also negligible.There has boon at times a considerable a&amp;rgin of wool available for civilian trades;  But during 1918 this margin has boon steadily dwindling.    It may now bo regardooi as a kind of insurance rosorvo for unforseen military ro-eruirements (o*g, tho clothingoof the American Army) aid it 18 doubtful whether the War Office would agroo to any further curtailment even if it wore practicable to reduce civilian consumption appreciably, which i  probably is not.
qi 4. There remains cotton, which is the only one ofthe commodities used as illustrations by the Minister of Food f)   in the case of which civilian trade is still important enough to provide any large amount of tonnage if curtailed.    The existing curtailment of supplies for the Cotton Industry and its consequences in causing labour unrest are well known. At the present moment Lancashire is in the throes of a labour dispute arising directly from the restriction of material. A further considerable curtailment would result in widespread unemployment and dangerous discontent, and, as the cotton trada works mainly for export, in the crippling of a trade which at present furnishes a very large proportion of our total exports. The possible consequences in India, etc, would also have to be taken into account.In these circumstances a proposal to curtail further the already severely curtailed cotton imports would seem to the Board of Trade highly inopportune.S 5. It is possible that the Food Controller had in mindother raw materials for civilian trade.    In connection with these it may be pointed out (a) that in the case of all metals, industrial oils. etc.. import is regulated by war considerations exclusively;   (o) that timber is not being imported at all for what can properly be called civilian trades;   that it comes mainly from N. Europe in ships which cannot be diverted from that route, or from S. France in ships which go out with coal;  and that N* Europe and S. France contain no surplus cattle food;   (c) that paper and pulp also come from N. Europe under the same conditions as timber;   (d) that hides are in precisely the same position as leather;   (e) that rubber imports*which might possibly be dispensed with only amount to a few thousand tons;   (f) that no other raw materials for civilian trades are now being imported in any quantity worth mentioning.16. It is therefore evident that the proposal of theFood Controller practically means the cutting down of cotton imports;   and in view of the bulkiness of cattle foods no small, soale out would be worth consideration.I sincerely trust that the War Cabinet will not countenance any furtner reduction of cotton imports..    A. H. STANWbard of TradeI    19th September, 1913.
