icI Itep pocament is the Property-of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] ^ ^ &quot;\&apos;7CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office,Austria /010[September 18, 1918.]MEMORANDUMonCONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN AUSTRIA.Reports of schemes being prepared for the federalisation of Austria appeared in the Czech clerical press about the middle of August. The belated denial made by the Austrian Government on the 28th August was ambiguous and unconvincing. Yet both the Germans arid the Magyars refuse to get excited about it, being firmly convinced that this is all eye-wash, and that it does not involve any serious purpose. The Czechs treat it with similar contempt, and say that the time for negotiations with the Vienna Government is past. These rumours and schemes are, however, interesting as following on the British declarations concerning the Czechs-Slovaks and as preceding the Austrian peace note.1. About the middle of August reports appeared in Czech clerical papers alleging that a scheme was being prepared for the federalisation of Austria; that Austria was to be changed into four national States, a German,.a Czech, a Jugo-Slav, and a Polish State; that Parliament, which &quot; remains too much uiider Radical influences,&quot; being incapable of doing the work, it is done by a committee composed of &quot; the best men of all the nationalities of the Monarchy&quot;; and that after a satisfactory scheme had been evolved, a new Government would be appointed to realise it.On the 28th August the Austrian Government issued an ambiguous communique denying the different reports, but stating that the Government considered &quot; a revision of the constitution, preserving all the interests implied in the integrity of the State, one of its most important tasks,&quot; yet that the preparatory work had not advanced sufficiently for any public announcements to be made about it. In a speech delivered on the 11th September, Baron von Hussarek declared that there are two limits to constitutional reform in Austria &quot; respect for the rights and constitution of Hungary, and the determination to preserve the idea of the united Austrian State.&quot; In other words, this &quot; reform &quot; can give neither reunion nor statehood to the Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs.On the 31st August the &quot; Neue Freie Presse&quot; published a leading article which began as follows: &quot; Some time, ago a savant of high rank called on the Prime Minister. He intimated to him that a circle of men sharing his views were working on a scheme for the federalisation of Austria. He asked the Prime Minister to support him and to take a share in the work. Baron von Hussarek refused to have anything to do with the carrying out of that plan.&quot;The name of the savant was not given, but it was either Professor Lammasch or Dr. Redlich.2. The most significant fact is the almost total absence of serious excitement in German-Austrian circles. The prospect of even insignificant concessions to the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs provoke violent storms in the German camp. But this scheme for &quot; constitutional reform &quot; is so obviously unreal that it fails to move them. They protest, but there is neither anxiety nor passion in their protests. They know that it can never be carried through the Austrian Parliament, as the Slav opposition, even if it were joined by the Poles and the German Socialists, would not dispose of the two-thirds majority required for constitutional changes, and a coup tfEtat could never be carried out against the will of Germany and Hungary.3. The sanest Magyar papers say that if Hussarek means to &quot; reform &quot; he will find that he cannot do so. They practically all agree in stating that any such measure would put an end to the connection between Austria and Hungary. Count Julius Andrassy (the elder) purposely inserted a clause in the Agreement 6f 1867 to the effect [367-42]
that it holds only provided both Austria and Hungary are ruled in accordance with the constitution. This gives the Magyars the power to intervene on behalf of the existing centralist Austrian constitution. According to some reports, Dr. Wekerle has already intimated to the Austrian Government that they would do so, but even if he has not done so the entire Hungarian Government press has.4. No importance whatsoever is attached to the rumours of constitutional reform in Czech national circles. On the contrary, intense irritation is shown at those clericals who dabble in these matters. The conservative Old-Czech &quot;Moravske Orlice,&quot; the organ of the ex-Minister Zhachek, although it does not approve of the intransigent position taken up by the majority of the Czech Parliamentary representation, emphasises that unity is the main thing and must be preserved at any price.&quot; It is a daring game in which we have engaged, but once we have done so we cannot withdraw with honour. Moreover, we shall soon see how authoritative circles conceive the great constitutional reform by which they desire to impress the Entente and especially President Wilson, and we shall learn whether it is true that the constitutional transformation of Austria is to be carried&apos;out independently of Parliament by a supreme act of the monarch.&quot;M. Stanek, the chief leader of the Czech Parliamentary Union comprising all the 108 Czech members but one of the Austrian Parliament, spoke as follows in a public meeting of Slovaks held on the 3rd September : &quot; Negotiations are of no use because our final aim cannot be reached by negotiations. No one is authorised to negotiate ; on the other hand the Govern-ment of Baron von Hussarek has not put its plans of constitutional reform before the Czech politicians. The time for negotiations is long past, and the present situation is much tOo serious for any one to conduct binding negotiations with the Government or to give any opinions on governmental proposals unless authorised by the Czech Parliamentary Union or by the Czech National Committee.&quot;On the 3rd September apolitical discussion took place in the Committee of the Czech State-Right Democrats (Dr. Kramarzh&apos;s party) and resolutions were passed to the effect that &quot; no reports about attempts to reconstruct the Austrian Monarchy, not even if they are true, can in any way change the fundamental point of view taken up by the Czech nation; the Czechs will stand by it to the victorious end.&quot;M. Klofac, the leader of the National Socialists, who, together with the Social Demo-crats with whom they have recently united, hold in the Austrian Parliament 40 out of the 108 Czech seats and represent practically half the Czech electorate in Austria, made the following declaration in a Czech meeting held on the 6th September: &quot; In evil days we have not lost our heads, and threats could not break our force. Nor shall we lose our heads now, and promises will have no effect upon us  they have no currency in Bohemia. The Vienna circles obey the Pan-Germans, and even if they wished, they would be unable to do wljat they promise. The Czech Parliamentary representation has said what it wants. They have declared it in the name of the entire Czech nation. The Czech question has become a problem which can in no way be negotiated with the Vienna Government. The Vienna Government stands by the Dualist constitution, and the Czech question can no more be solved in the name of Dualism than that of the Jugo-Slavs. For that reason the different proposals of&quot; the Vienna Government cannot even interest us. We should like to see the Czech who under present conditions would co-operate in that mysterious Vienna kitchen where such proposals are cooked. The Czech National Union alone is responsible for Czech policy, only this and the National Committee can speak for the nation.&quot;The &quot;Lidove Noviny,&quot; the paper of Dr. Stransky, a Moravian Jew and one of the most prominent leaders of the Moravian Czech radicals, in its issue of the 27th August openly accused of treason those who have anything to do with the Vienna proposals, and went on to state that the body of the Czech clergy stands by the Czech people and only the leaders of the Clerical group fail to do so.This view very soon found a striking confirmation. On the 28th August the bishops of Austria published a pastoral letter condemning those who incite &quot; to treason against the Emperor and the Empire&quot; part of the clerical campaign to save Austria. On the 3rd September the Czech clergy of all the dioceses of Bohemia gathered in
Prague passed a resolution stating that they see &quot; in the realisation of an independent Czecho-Slovak State a deed of the historic justice of God.&quot; When on the 30th May, 1917, the Czechs representatives in the Austrian Parliament made their first declaration in favour of an independent Czecho-Slovak State they had still thought it advisable to mask it by professing the wish to see it formed under the Habsburg sceptre. The declaration of the 6th January, 1918, no longer mentioned the Habsburgs. Nor are they mentioned in the declaration of the Czech clergy, which is thus a direct answer to the bishops, to those who profess faith in the possibility of constitutional reform within the Habsburg monarchy and is an act of practically revolutionary character.5. Outside clerical circles the only people who profess to believe in the possibility of constitutional reform within Austria are a group of ultra-moderate German Socialists in Vienna, following the lead of the notorious Austrian Socialist-Imperialist, Karl Renner. Like the clericals they abstain from giving the reasons for the faith which is in view.6. No constitutional reform within the boundaries of Austria is possible. Even the widest degree of autonomy by itself would not satisfy the Czechs or the Jugo-Slavs, who aspire to national unity, and national unity would imply the break-up of the Hungarian State. The Poles would gain nothing because they are anyhow the masters of Galicia, but what they aim at is reunion with Russian Poland. Should any attempt be made to liberate East Galicia from Polish dominion, the Poles would once more come out in the sharpest opposition, but if East Galicia is definitely handed over to them under a scheme of federalisation, nothing would be left to the Ukrainians of that&apos; country but. revolution. The Germans naturally would never agree to a federalisation of Austria whereby the Germans of Bohemia would become a minority in a Czech State, and the Germans of the southern provinces be cut off from the Adriatic. It is a matter of comparative indifference to them whether their Austria is being broken up under the Habsburg sceptre or by the Entente. The Magyars, as stated above, would never agree to a federalisation of Austria which on their borders would create self-governing States, centres of irredentism for the non-Magyar nations of Hungary. It seems, therefore, unlikely that these schemes are meant seriously by anybody who deserves being taken seriously. In so far as they are not merely a symptom of the complete chaos in Vienna Government circles they are at the end of their wits they were probably meant as a prelude to the Peace Note.7. It may be interesting to note that the British declarations about the Czecho-Slovaks, so far from stiffening the back of Austrian Government circles, seem to have caused a panic among them.. From the very outset attempts were made to hide their real importance it was, e.g., given out in the Vienna &quot; Neue Freie Presse &quot; that one of their main aims is to get the status of belligerents for the Czechs in their conflicts with the Bolsheviks. Then the rumours about constitutional reform were set going. Lastly, in the Peace Note, the British Declarations were treated as non-existing.On the other hand, it is obvious that the fullest credit is given to them by the Czech Parliamentary Club, in which the Clericals have but seven out of 107 members, and even these seven have so far remained loyal to the party, and have in no way publicly identified themselves with the manoeuvres of the clerical press.
