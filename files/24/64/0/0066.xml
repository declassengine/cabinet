I would urge this suggestion an the strongest possible terms d   I feel certain that the description of the horrors of St.Peter and St.Pauls1 Fortress would produce a great revulsion of feeling among the working classes throughout the Allied world against the Pacifists and Bolsheviks, who are always striving ceaselessly to find occasion to hinder the War effort of the Allies,(Sd.)

M.P.A.Hani-icy.The Rt. Hon.Lord Be,;:verbrook, &amp;c,MINISTRY OF INFORMATION.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 24th, Sept. 1918.
