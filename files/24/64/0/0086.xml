25th SBRP,1913, SOLE- IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF TEE NAVAL- SITUATION AND SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.jjj^^^lfcw that the general Man-Power Situation for 1918-1919 is being reviewed, it is opportune to review also the Naval. Situation in relation to National effort,  We have passed,, for the tiino at any rate, tho acute Military situation which has made such irresistible demands upon, our National effort since March of this year/never in terms been revoked by tho Cabinet, and&apos; in theory it exists to-day, but in fact it has been withdrawn to a serious extent.  It is for the Cabinet to decide how tho National war effort should be applied, and I realise that on occasion it may be necessary for the War Cabinet to give decisions which are not in accordance with the views of the Minister responsible for the Department concerned, or his advisors.   In the case of the Admiralty I deom it to be my duty to accept, as far as,..possiblo, the general decisions of my Colleagues on tho War Cabinet, but also I deem it my duty and responsibility to bring to their notice the effect of those decisions upon the Naval situation and the views of the Board of Admiralty thereon.   It is, therefore, with no feeling of returning to tho charge where decisions have bee?1, taken by the War Cabinet against tho Admiralty that this paper is written, but solely with tho object of bringing before them the Naval situation as the Board of Admiralty sees it, and as it is affected by tho decisions which the War Cabinet have taken^ against the advice of the Board of Admiralty.In the earlier yoars of the war the Navy obtained first priority in its material end man power.  That first priority hasThe,stain
fvJ CJIThe main activities of tho Kavy for the purposes of this paper may be divided into three(a) The Grand Fleet, which opposes and holds the mainenemy capital forces,,(b) The miscellaneous&apos;Naval activities all over the world,including the contribution of the British Navy to tho Mediterranean j where tho French command and are responsible oxcept in so far as submarine warfare is concernedj(c) Tho general anti-submarine warfare, including theconvoying, safeguarding and arming of Merchant ships.As regards (a), with tho exception of certain instruments such as modem range finders and fire control instruments, the supply of which is affected by the decisions, of the Cabinet detailed hereafter, tho situation to-day may be considered as satisfactory.As regards (b) the situation is not satisfactory,  here is ample force in the Mediterranean to deal with any enemy forces which may be brought against the Allies, but tho Allied forces aro unorganised and the necessity for a unified command there is, in the opinion of the Board of Admiralty, becoming increasingly urgent, and in their view, if the Mediterranean is not reorganised at a very early date - and it is beyond the power of the British Admiralty to-day to reorganise it - we may be faced-with occurrences whioh will be more than regrettahlo.   In anti-submarine work tho reorganisation carried out early this year has teen followed by 6Cfo reduction jji losses.As regards (o) the situation is as set out belowThe German Submarine effort has fluctuated, as have our measures of defence and offence.  A statement is attached(Appendix A)....0.
(Appendix A) giving the position of tho Gorman submarine fleet at various periods from the commencement of tho war.   It will be soon that from August 1914 to the end of 1916 the additions and losses are givon annually; during 1917 they are given quarterly, and thereafter monthly.  It will be observed that a considerable effort was made by tho enemy, as wo all know, to bring tho submarine offensive to a successful culmination atend of 1917.   Thereafter his efforts wanod, but ho is again working up to another great effort so far as numbers of submarines are concerned.   In the immediate past, he reached his low water mark last May, at which date the destructive power of tho Dover Barrage and of the activity of our patrols in tho Straits of Dover roachod its maximum.   Simultaneously, owing to the oocurrences in France in the second-quarter of this yoar, the Navy was called upon to make a tremendous effort in the safeguarding and oscorting of American troops, and our plans forhunting the Submarine, which had matured during tho preceding weremonths, Jiad-taJae scrapped, and our craft and trained personnel iNBteterfeQf uqgcI in other ways.   That effort has enabled the Allied forces in France to regain the initiative, but. to a very great oxtent the anti-submarine war has suffered thereby, and the German submarines are now increasing because our destructive forces have been withdrawn.,and this simultaneously with a greater effort than has ever before boon made by Germany to increase hor submarine Offensive.   It is true that the measures we have taken are increasing the difficulties under which the submarine operates, and that the crows of the submarines are less efficient than they were.   But the submarines are of an improved type with heavier guns and the nature of the traffic now crossing the Atlantic demands a higher standard of escort.
29 M i&apos;J -IFor a time, therefore, although we no3d not perhaps look for largely increased i0300s in Merchant tonnage, wo ought not to expect reduced losses, and unless wo not* take ctepa to inorease the offensive power against the submarine the time will again - oome when tho losses by enemy submarines may be a menace to the security -of tho Allied cause.   From Appendix 4 it will be seen that we believe that there are 160 Gorman submari-nee available. On the basis of tho most favourable rate of des-tmotion of these which it is reasonable to assume from past experience, by the end of the year, having regard to the increased output, there will be 180 enemy submarines available - more than there have ever been before,   I repeat that it is not considered that those submarines will have the same destructive power as , they world have had under the conditions which existed a year or eighteen months ago, because our measures of all kinds against the submarine have improved enormously both offensive and defensive, but the situation is one   not free from anxiety - an .. anxiety which my Colleagues in, tho Cabinet may overlook in a way. which is impofssible in land warfare, which comes, so much more under the eye an$o the knowledge of Members of the Government and of the Public,It is therefore essential that, in considering the important, urgent and intricate matters connected with Man-power which come before the War Cabinet from day to day, that they should realise that a great enemy submarine offensive is not only threatened but is materialising.   It is in these circumstances that the Cabinet is reminded that by recent decisions on man-power it was felt necessary to impose the clean out for Military Service of men bom in the years 1898 and 1899, even when engaged on important Admiralty work,   A statement is attached (Appendix&apos;B) Showing the immediate effect of this clean cut on the production of guns, gun mountings, and fire control appliances.   The Admiralty programme provided for the mounting of at least one large modern gun on board each Merchant ship of over 1500 tons,but due to the cause 3tated, completion of the contracts enteredinto for the.,.
into for the supply of these gunfl will &quot;bo deferred 6 monthot and the total deliveries will not he received until November 1910, The absence of the long range guns renders tho Merchant ship an easy prey to the new type of submarine now being turned out by the enemy, and will necessitate a material extension of the convoy system.   If owing to the lack of armament in Merchant ships it is necessary to extend the convoy system to outward bound ships in the same way as to homeward bound ships, delays to tonnage and therefore reduction in the use of tho tonnage will be inevitable It      impossible to give figures which would measure the loss of imports consequent upon this action, but experience generally points to the conclusion that the loss would certainly not be less than 16?X*   Further, any extension of the convoy system would necessitate the retention of American escort forces! on their cwn coasts to moot these convoys, and thereby compel the British Admiralty to increase their building programme of light craft, A point which should not be lost si^ht of in connexion with the insufficiency of gun power, is the offeot on the morale of the Merchant Service when they are attacked under a disadvantage in armament, and recently we have been receiving such significant &quot;signals as follows from MeOchant ships attacked:18 S ,.0, S,    S 0 S e S 0    Gun out rang ed1, and quite recently a vessel of 7500 tonnage was overwhelmed and sunk by gun fire nearly 1,000 miles from the coast.As will be seen from Appendix. B the recent decision of the Cabinet in the clean cut has fco&amp;nthe effect of delaying the guns and gun mountings for the dofensive arming of Merchant shipsrby 6 months, andthe mountings for 4,7 ;Tuns in destroyers  win notbe delivered by the time the ships are completed.The Cabinet is reminded also that it recently decided,with a view to expediting the output of.Merchant tonnage, thatthe satisfactory agreement r&quot;ith the United States Government -which was the only possibility which the Board of Admiralty feltwould justify them in putting forward the reduction of the 1919Naval Prograrsne - was tc be assumed, and that in anticipation of asatisfactory/
satisfactory arrangement with the United States, the productive power of the Sards was to be transferred to Merchant Craft.    The Board of Admiralty, although they would have preferred not to take an- action until a satisfactory agreement had actually been concluded with America, have acted on the Cabinet decision, but it may be necessary to ask the Cabinet to reverse that decision should a satisfactory agreement not be obtained with the United Statescments are being curtailed.    It is undoubtedly satisfactory that the great predominance in the air should be maintained in France,   -and there is no doubt that magnificent work is being done by the Air Force in France,   At the same time it may well be that because of the spectacular and more tangible,results of their work, a preference is being given there which in the end may not be wise. The original and main justification, as my-memory serves me, for the new Air Ministry was that there would be a surplus of machines. That surplus has never been realised because of the development of the aerial arm and the cumulative demands of all three Services have soared far-above out put 0       But it is right that the Cabinet should realise in considering the increased submarine effort of the enemy, that the reduced programme of anti-submarine air squadrons asked for for service round the British Isles has been cut downby the Air Board by and the total Naval aircraft requirements by 27fo.To summarise therefore, the purport of this paper, I would say that owing to the pressure for maintaining Mili tary forces in France, and owing to the reduced losses by submarines -engendering a complacency which is not justified under1 present circumstances, the old principle of priority of Naval require-ments, which was rightly laid down and rigorously worked to in the early days of the war,, has been vitiated in a way which is not, sound,. The Alliance exists only by safeguarding the lines of communication, which we know is,, with the exception of theThereis anothier direction in which the Admiralty require-Mediterranean/
Mediterranean, the function of tho British Navy, and in tho Mediterranean the responsibility of the anti-submarine war is ours.It is, in my opinion, not only a National but an Intor-Allied duty that the.first call upon our resources should be for the Navy,,    In theory wo have that to-day; in practice wo are not getting it.    &apos;Where the Board of Admiralty can see their way to make a reduction they have proposed it willingly, as in the case of tho 1919 building programme., but the recent outs on man-power which have been imposed by the Cabinet upon the Admiralty are indeed serious, and I would ask that the War Cabinet should return to the old faith of putting the Navy first in these matters.   The few thousand men which our great Army has gained by depriving the Admiralty of the skilled and essential men involved is nothing compared with tho sacrifice which has been made by reason o:C the consequent reduction in output in the items given in Appendix B.     And besides those cases quoted in Appendix B there are many others&apos; erf less outstanding import which tho Cabinet will recollect, such as tubes for Destroyer boilers of which our reserves, owing to the Cabinet action in withdrawing the few men essential to that industry, aro now   -   - down to nil.   If the Cabinet reaffirms the principle that the needs of the Admiralty are to have the first call upon the resources of the Nation, proposals to give effect to that principle will be discussed with the Departments con-corned, and if necessary, submitted to the- Cabinet, so that the situation where it is unsatisfactory can bo adjusted.(3d, ) ERIC GEDDES.25th September, 1918.
