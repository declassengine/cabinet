. Britannic Wlalesty^s Govern MN-POWER 1916-1019.relating to Man-Power in 1918-1919, in which he sets out his proposals with regard to the distribution amongst the various Services of the man-power available,,   The demands of the Admiralty have, in the main, been conceded, and the Admiralty is in a position to express a general acceptance of these proposals.   A reservation, however, must be made with regard to the estimate of Naval requirements for the period June to December 1919., for which a 25$ reduction on the figures for the first half of 1919 was agreed to, and while this reduction was justified at the time it was made, circumstances may arise in which it would be necessary to review the situation,With this reservation, the Admiralty concur in these proposals of the Minister of Natioal Service and venture to urge tho Cabinet to give effect to them,with reference to the proposals for further recruitingcontained in Part II of the Memorandum of the Minister of National Service, it is important to observe that the reoruit-ment in the earlier part of the year of all men bom in the years 1898 and 1899 has caused a serious diminution in the output of commodities essential to the Admiralty for carrying on the War,   In several important industries the complement of labour has been reduced to the lowest practicable point andno further recruitment ispossible without jeopardising necessary supplies.   Indeed, in certain cases it is being found necessary to get back men from the Army.   Accordingly, the proposals of the Minister of National Service that the Admiralty should release this year all Grade I men born in the year 1900, and next year all such men born in the year 1901 -  with the exception of those for whom an age liait of 19 is fixed in the Schedule of Protected Occupations, and men engaged on the manufacture of scientific instruments - will make&quot;it impossible for the Admiralty to carry on its necessary trork, unless further exceptions are made,   Those exceptions -details of which can be arranged with the Minister of National Service - relate to men employed in the following industriesSteel and Brass Tubes:Copper Wire for both Naval and Military Services: Anchors and Chain Cables: Guns and their Accessories:Iron and Steelworks, including Rivet, Bolt and Nat Manufactories:Occupations marked &quot;S&quot; in the Schedule of Protected Occupations; (These are occupations in which men a^e only recruited subject to substitutes being found)It is desired that the exceptions above enumeratedshould be given effect to in the recruiting proposals of the Minister of National Service with regard to the men born in 1900 and 19C1,22, 9. 18,(Sgd.)
