The views of the Swiss (Government had previously been submitted to the Allied Governments In a formal note, and these views were substantially maintained by M, Schulthese in the Berne interview,     Serious objections were raised to the idea of Swiss collaboration, and M, Soaultheas urged H.M. Government to abandon altogether the idea of an official Blacklist for Switzerland.    He laid great stress on the certainty of $erman, retaliation and the consequent rain of the Swiss1&apos; industries which depend on German coal and Herman iron and steel.   - He- was inform-ed-that, if the Swiss.refused their collaboration it would be accessary for the Allies to proceed&apos;independently.

SPA Iff *    The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an inter-view with H.M. Charge 3)&apos;Affaires at Madrid on September 4th, saia that, though the Spanish Government refused to recognise German safe conducts, they must also refuse to recognise the right of a foreign Government to prohibit Spanish vessels from accepting them.     The Minister, however, expressed himself as satisfied with the explanation that the Allied Governments were only objecting to the acquiescence of a Central Government in an illegal control of their shipping by the enemy,    The French Government think that, in the circumstances, it will Use better to refrain from further allusion to the :uestion unless some particular instance should arise.     The Spanish Minister stated that the Germans are objecting to ceding the German vessels in-terned in Spanish ports in compensation for the Spanish ships recently torpedoed.    The reason alleged is that, if these vessels are put at the disposal of Spain   for trade with South America, other Spanish vessels will necessarily be released for general services which may prove of benefit to the Allies., MWD STATES.   The United States Government have invited the views of H.M, Government upon a proposal, to assume control of tj*e United States Cotton crop.    She new crop will not exceed 11.000,000 boles, of which a \&amp;rge proportion will be lower grade cotton.    Hitherto the lower grades have not bean used fer supplying the United States and British armies, and there is a considerable accumulation of these lower grades from the previous year.     There is, on the other hand, a serious scarcity of the higher grades,     The United States War Industries Board think that some form of rationing by grades %ill be necessary. They are conducting experiments in the raising of ^ower grade cotton with the higher grades, as they believe it will be necessary
