it1 r: i 4V;;/&apos;  CJl-vCULlT^J TO THE KING        WAR CABINET,.I circulate the following draft telegram in pursuance of the War Cabinet resolution or last Friday:The present organisation of Allied efforts in Siberia is the occasion of no little anxiety to His Majesty*s Government,   Unity of Allied military command has - at least in principle - been secured, But there, is no satisfactory machinery for dealing with, the innumerable problems that ift^out^ide the normal functions of a general in the field.        ?j,,\  *The country is divided, among Governments of varying political complexion; it is traversed by contending armies who owe no common allegiance; it is, in many districts, without food and without money.. Large though ill defined areas are under enemy con-trol,   While even where enemy soldiers are absent, enemy agents swarm.It seems to His Majesty&apos;s Government clear that the innumerable questions that this condition of things will force upon the attention of the Allies cannot he dealt with merely by adding to the powers of the Commander-in-Chief. For they are not purely military questions directly connected with the con-trol safety and supply of forces in the. fieldc   They must frequently involve political considerationof
of the utmost difficulty and delicacy.   It is true that it is the settled policy of the co-belligerents to take no sides- in arranging the political future of Russia,   All are agreed in thinking that only Russians should determine now Russia is to he ruled. Yet in our efforts to render self-determination possible in the near future we cannot completely isolate ourselves from the turmoil of the immediate present.   We must co-operate with the forces which are hostile to our enemies, and oppose those who are hostile to our friends.   We cannot, if we would, avoid all relations with the various Governments and armies which control different regions of the country: and we cannot have relation with these without the constant emergence of problems which lie outside the proper duties of a Commander-in^ Chief and a Head Quarter Staff.But what machinery have we for dealing with them?   So far as His Majesty1s Government are aware there is none except that which is provided by the informal intercourse or Allied commissioners, Consuls, soldiers and sailors at Vladivostok, who are drawn . from live or  (including the Czechs) six different nations, who have no -collective and small individual authorityj who must be constantly appealing to their several Governments, who in all cases where commonaction
action is required must in their turn consult with each other before arriving at a decision.   When it is remembered how much may depend on rapidity of action, and how near we are to the Russian winter, this condition of things is a just cause of anxiety.His Majesty&apos;s Government have no complete cure, for the evils I have endeavoured to describe: but they offer the following suggestion in the hope of dim!n- &quot; ishing their intensity.1,    Matters purely military should of course . .-.continue to&apos; be decided by the Military Authorities.orBut questions involving political/economic issues should he referred to a body representing all the Powers, and containing a strong civilian elements This convention might work through Committees when &apos; this seemed the most convenient course.2,    Its meeting place should be either at Vladivostok or Washington.   Vladivostok is nearest to . the theatre of operations; but if it be thought de-sirable to sit in a capital, Washington seems the capital best suited for the purpose. . It is more con-venient for the Japanese than Versailles, more con-venient for the European Allies than Tokio, and. more convenient for the Americans than either one or the other....It shall be observed that at Versailles neitherthe
(4)othe Americans nor the Japanese  are fully Represented while these are the two Powers whoso-&apos;sliare-in Siberian operations entitle them-to -special con-si deration.3a    The convention should sit continuously and unlike the Versailles Council should have a certain measure of executive responsibility.   Large question of policy must as heretofore, be decided by the various Governments in consultation.   But we may hope that all minor points will be settled on the spot and that even when the Convention feels unable to act on its own authority it will be in a position to offer valuable guidance,I need only add that while Mis Majesty&apos;b Govern-ment attach no special value to the scheme thus roughly outlined., they do hold it to be of vital importance that some machinery should he devised less cumbersome than that through whi.ch-4h-e--co-belligerent Powers are now endeavouring to carry out their difficult task.
