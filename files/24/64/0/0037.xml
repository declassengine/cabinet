[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for l lie use of the Cabinet.   September 19.18SECRET.^\ rxr5&quot;Y3^*)l WAGE INCREASES.^IL^jyjl^fClJLATE a menioraadiim which the Labour Department has prepared by &quot;TSytlTrection, and which embodies my views.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I wish to draw to the attention of the War Cabinet the following considerations, which arise out of the memorandum by the Committee on Production on the procedure in regard to the method of arranging general changes in wages. General changes in wages in the munition industries are determined by the Committee on Production, and it is essential that other industries should be brought under the same procedure.2. The Ministry of Munitions is in agreement with the recommendations of the Committee on Production contained in paragraphs 11 and 12 of their memorandum, though it is feared, as to paragraph 11, that considerable difficulty will be encountered in securing the general assent of trades now outside the arbitration provisions of the Munitions of War Acts, and as to paragraph 12 that the principle of wage advances being governed solely by increased cost in living will not be accepted while capital is permitted&apos;to make increased profits during the war.:i It is vital, however, for the War Cabinet to understand that this question of general changes in wages is not the only, nor, indeed, the most important, aspect of the present wages position. In addition to the general advances common to a trade, workmen in many of the munition industries have been able to secure from employers sectional advances on pre-war rates of large amounts. The abolition of the Leaving Certificate has restored to the workmen their bargaining power, the shortage of labour among many classes of skilled men has accentuated it, and the constant extension of the munitions programme has intensified the competition among employers for labour.The result has been a constant rise over the pre-war time rates of skilled engineers, wood-workers, electricians, &amp;c. These increases have occurred in many districts, but are most marked in London. Shortly, these men have succeeded in securing, in addition to the general trade advances, sectional advances often twice as great. So long as sectional advances can be obtained in the munition industries it would be a delusion to expect stability in other trades as a result of co-ordinating the Committee on Production^ cost of living advances. If these cost of living advances were paid in all the principal trades in the country, grave dissatisfaction would still exist in those industries where the workpeople could not secure also sectional advances comparable to those already obtained in the munitions inductries. The workpeople look to their actual total earnings, not to the elements of which they are composed.4 It is for the above reasons that the War Cabinet should consider how this tendency to sectional advances of large amounts in the munition industries can be stopped or at least regulated. The provisions of the Munitions of War Acts are ineffective for this purpose, and it should be stated that in instances where flagrant disregard of the Ministry&apos;s instructions have been ascertained and prosecution has followed, purely nominal fines have been imposed which in no way act as a deterrent to employers. Moreover, the provisions of the Act itself in this respect are so loose that employers can, with the exercise of a little ingenuity, pay what wages they please without any liability to prosecution, and. so secure the labour they require to fulfil lucrative contracts.The question is extremely urgent, but of such complexity as to require a more detailed exposition than is practicable herein. These present observations are submitted so that the War Cabinet may appreciate that the proposals contained in the memorandum by the Committee on Production, though desirable in themselves, touch merely the fringe of the problem.September 19, 1918.
