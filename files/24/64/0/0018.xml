Government enabling the latter to prevent the importation into Prance of certain descriptions&quot; of paper and paper goods whoso manufacture in Prance is not permit tod.    This arrangement establishes the general principle that, notwithstanding the agreement concluded with M.

Applications jfor licenses to import paper and paper goods into  ranee will in future be dealt with in Paris whore the technical questions involved can be properly examined, instead of by the French Custom House in London as heretofore.   The traffic in papor and paper goods of other descriptions will not be interfered with by the French authorities.A. Ho STANLEY.17th September, 192B.0BSE ASD INDUSTRY,

Considerable delay has however been caused in dealing with applications as only a very snail proportion of the xbrms are accurately filled in, and most have to be sent back ones or oftener for amendments    Consequently a considerable number were outstanding at the end of July and large numbers were still coming in.

The registration will enable seamen entitled thereto *    to bo given an identity and service certificate, vahich will be endorsed by the Ministry of National Service,   -and will thereupon become a protection from recruitaeat; until now seamen have been protected by a general exemption under an Army Council Instruction of 1916. The identity and service certificate *ill also be useful for production to Aliens Authorities at home and abroad as evidence of nationality.     The scheme is the outcome of consideration by a Committee which included representatives of shipowners andthe Seamen1s Unions; and it will be worked with the co-operation of the Shipowners&apos; Associations and the Seamen1 s Unions.  One feature of tho scheme will be the limitation of the eriod spent on shore between voyages by seamen, so as o secure that soamon are not a snore for an unduly long ieriod;  and service afloat, with reasonable intervals Jl loavo ashore.&apos;will bo a condition of protection from recruitment.MerQ.ai.taja The Mercantile Marine, being regarded as &amp; strictlyUmBgl&apos;   civilian body, have been considered ineligible for anymedal that Jhay be awarded for combatant service during the War.

jojPSM Law iraendmejalTho report of the Committee, under tho Chairmanship cf Lord ;&apos;iTrcnburyf appointed to enquire what Amendments are expedient in the Companies Acts, particularly having regard to circuiastances ariaii% out ox the war and of the developments likely to arise on its conclusion, has been issued.The Committee express tbe opinion that in all Aaoendments of the Companies Acts, the ex-pediency of the attraction of Foreign capital should oc steadily homo in mind, and anything which would have a restrictive or deterrent effect, should,as far as possible, be avoided.   The Committee would&apos;make no discrimination as far as athe Law of Joint Stock Companies is concerned between Aliens of different&apos;nationality, and as regards Companies generally they are not in favour of any restriction or disclosure of Alien interests.In the case of Companies owning British shipping the Committee recommend that not more than ZOt/o of the Snare Capital should be held by Aliens and that the Share Capital hold by Aliens should carry not more than 2Q?o of the voting power, or should carry no vote at all, and  that disclosure of nationality  and of trusts should be required from every transfer*e and allottee of Shares in Shipping Companies.If it is decided to deal with key Industries, so far as Companies are concerned, by Company legis* let ion and not by legislation on the lines of the Eon-Ferrous Metal Industry Act, the Committee recommend that Companies carrying on key industries should be subject to the obligations suggested with regard to Shipping Companies, but they point out that while those obligations will in tneir opinion secure dis-closuro in the large majority of cases, deliberate end intentional evasion will be possible.The above Act. which was passed on the 8th August, confers on the Board of Trade extended pto order the winding*up of businesses which have been carried on for the benefit of enemy subjects, and empowers the Board to order the realisation and distribution of assots of enemy businesses which have ceased to be carried on.

The transaction has worked smootnJLv, the shipments have been -invoiced direct to the Mills, and the Treasury has had to make no cash advance in this connection.C0A1The position in regard to supplies continues to be on* of the utmost difficulty.    Steps are being taken to divert current supplies irom works where a large tonnage is held in stock,, or to take possession 01 ex-Cess stocks at such works, and use the surplus to assist other consumers.It has been ascertained that there is a cousid-able ruantity of usable coal on the waste heaps at a number of pits and endeavours are being made to find outlets for this fuel.    The labour difficulty enters largely into the question, and it is hoped that the assistance of labour battalions may be secured.The surcharge of 10 kroner per ton imposed in retaliation for the high prices asked for Danish butter, on all coal exported to Denmark: has been increased to 15 kroner per ton as from the 26th August,The Controller has offered to allow payment of the War Wage for overtime on condition, inter alia, that the surface workers1 demand for an eight-hour day shall be postponed until after the  War.31ffi.BBB SCP.PLISSIn conjunction with the Coal Controller a schema is being worked out for supplementing Coal supplies with Wood,    An Order is about to be i-sued fixing maximum prices and providing for distribution through local Coal Authorities of wood suitable for fuel, whether obtained from the operations of the Timber Supply Depart-ment (Including the Canadian Forestry Corps) or of timber merchants.Sudden demands for large quantities of timber for the United States forces in France have been received, the meeting of which may necessitate further tonnage.

Stocks in bond on 31st August amounted to 52,570 tons, or 3,557 tons more than on 30th JuneThe question of output from tobacco factories is becoming increasingly difficult, ard numerous complaints are being received of short supdies, both to His Majesty^ Forces and civilains, and considerable unrest continues to occur in munition and industrial areas.    The Board have taken steps to alleviate the position as far as possible, but the constant calling to the Colours of labour from the Tobacco Factories tearis to aggravate the position, whioh is becoming more acute.The labour situation at the Bonded Warehouses in London, Liverpool and Glasgow is also very unsatisfactory, a in the consequent delays in the delivery of the necessary raw leaf to manufacturers tends to decrease the output still further.  This is also receiving the attention of tho Board.MATCHES.A certain quantity of matches have been imported from lorway during the last six weeks.The output of home manufactories is still rather disappointing, owing to a temporary shortage of labour due to the holiday season anl tte recent influenza epidemic.BO AD TRANSPORT BOARDUnder the Road Transport Order, 1918, no goods-oarrying vehicles with the exception of horse-drawn vehicles of a load capacity of less ihan 15 cwt. and vehicles jnolly or mainly used in agriculture, nay be used.without a permit issued by the Board.
