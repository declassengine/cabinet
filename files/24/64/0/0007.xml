SB OR (1X3X70)*(7l *A; ;E0 A 3 I i! E T.TUK&amp;1Y ocldi:JJiaOA&apos;JJ3D lORlkiii LTJCTEB  12TH [j^PT^Hffl^ 19181 &quot;The present position with regard to the exchange of prisoners of war with Turkey i&amp; as followsAs the result of a meeting between British and Turkish Representatives held at Berne in December, 1917, an agreement was arrived at for the exchange of civilians and of all invalid combatants; the schedule of disability for the latter being of an extremely lenient character.In order to carry out the exchange it was provided that a ship should convey Turkish prisoners from Alexandria to koala leva (in the vicinity of Pjayuna); that British prisoners should be collected at koala ijova in readiness for transportation, and that both Governments should obtain from their Allies safe conducts for the ship.   It was further provided that the ship should convey food and other supplies for the use of the remaining British prisoners.Should sea transport prove impracticable it was agreed -that transport by land should be resorted to*I&apos;his Agreement was signed in December 1917, but was not ratified by the Turkish Government until the end of April 1918.Daring the whole of the present year His L-Iajesty fs1 Government have made constant efforts, by every means within their power, firstly to obtain the ratification of the agreement, and when that was effected, to secure the carrying out of its provisions^     These efforts have hitherto been fruitless, although every expedient has been resorted to, including even the promise of renumeration to the officials concerned, and the payment of small sums of money on acoount. The difficulty in dealing with the Turkish Government is much enhanced by the fact that they are entirely indifferent as to the fate of Turkish prisoners and evince no desire whatever to see them repatriated.     In the past, we were able to exercise a certain amount of pressure in connection with a certain Ayoub Sabri, a prisoner to whom at one time-they attached importance, but they now take no interest even in this man, and as we hold no one who is considered to be of the slightest value no threat of drastic action on our part would be of any avail,     v.e have also good reasons for believing that whereas some influential Turks are desirous of carrying out the provisions of the agreement and recognise that the failure to do so is much to the discredit of their Government Enver Pasha, who has hitherto been the controlling force is strongly opposed to any exchange, and is encouraged in his obstruction by the German Government for obvious reasons.In
In view of the a ifficultios attending an exchange &quot;by land and the objections entertained by the British hi litnr.7 authorities to an exchange of prisoners through the lines, our efforts have been direote principally towards an exchange by sea.     The chief obstacle to this lay in the failure, until quite recently, to obtain the safe conducts from the German and Austrian Governments.    The latter has, however, now given the necessary guarantee\ and we have been informed that the German guarantee will probably be received within a few days.On August 14th we telegraphed to Constantinople to propose to the Turkish Government the head for head exchange of all British combatants who have been in captivity for over eighteen months, but hitherto no reply has been received.An endeavour is also being made to nut pressure on the Turks by mms of the Austrian Government, as we have recently told the latter that we will only discuss the question of the exchange of all their civilians on the condition that the;/ on their side will secure the carrying out of all the proposals made to the Turks.The failure to effect an exchange of prisoners with Turkey, however deplorable, cannot under any circumstances be attributed to any inaction or unwillingness on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     It is entirely due to the obstruction of the Turkish Government and there is unfortunately not much probability of this attitude being reversed until they have been decisively beaten in the fieldsOn the other hand, certain circumstances afford ground for some hope, Ilention has already been made of the fact that the safe con-duct for the ship may be shortly expected from Germany.The present Suit-,n is known to regard Thiver with disfavour end may be disposed to overrule him.     A Special personal appeal is therefore to be made to His Majesty by the Dutch Minister at Ggnstanti nople to insist upon the carrying out of the agreement;   and, lastly, we have received information that a number of British prisoners, amounting to about 1100, have been collected at Broussa, which may perhaps be preparatory to exchange.Finally, it should be noted that, in the event of the failure ofexchanges, steps have been taken to provide the prisoners in Turkey with the necessary food and supplies by alternative routes, and that inspectors from the Dutch Legation at Constantinople are on their way to visit the camps in Asia Minor.The Swedish Minister in London, who represents the Austrian, Bulg.cri;an and Turkish Governments aere, has suggested to all three tha there should be a Conference between us- and them in Switzerland.    He learns that the Austrians will gladly accept and there is reason to think the Bulgarians will do the same.     The possibility of repatria-tion from Turkey by land, failing that by sea, would natural ly be discussed at any such conference, and might result in some satisfactor arrangement *PRISONERS 03?
