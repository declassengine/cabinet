Home Forces would keep in touch with the Admiralty.    The probable number of marines available would not exceed 1200.SIR HERBERT WALKER stated that the strike had extended generally on the West Coast.    The N.W.R. and the S.W.R. were more affected than yesterday, but not so much as was expected.    There was serious dislocation at Liverpool and the strike had extended to Crewe and Preston.    On the -South Western Railway all the men at Nine Elms were out as they were at Eastloigh, Guil&amp;ford, and one or two other places.    Sir Herbert explained that h%ffias alluding mainly;td -engine drivers and firemen and said/he could trace nearly all the trouble to the members of the Associated Society of Engineers and Firemen.   /Sir Herbert expressed the opinion that he thought the strike.-.atold collapse if the Government continued to take drastic action.At a later stage in the proceedings it was announced that men at Reading and Slough were back at work and a telegram was received from the Chiof Constable, Merthyr Tydvil to the effect that the Cardiff men had gone back.Questioned with regard to the use of soldiers, Sir &apos; Herbert :&apos;sadd that no rioting had taken place at all, that there- was very; little molestation and that there was con* siderable falling off in picketing. -The organisation as far as the railways were&apos; concerned for cancelling the protection certificates of men on strike was complete.&apos; :&apos;. ;   .   At a;meeting held the previous, afternoon at the Head---&apos;;\;q.nw*ters of the Home Forces it v/as -agreed that the arrange-&quot;ments for the movement of soldiers should be the same as - -      -those which would deal; with an emergency such as an in-vasion.    4,000 troops from Aldershot had been moved to . South Wales that morning.   - :? -:&quot; THE C OMMDER-IH-CEIEF of the Home Forces said thatthese soldiers which had nbw: been-imoved would be at the .   disposal of the G.O.C. in South Wales to be used as required , &apos;        At the present-moment it was no good moving any more &quot;:J    &apos;&quot;&quot; - troops, but another 10,000 were standing by in readiness.EMPLOYMENT OP       . - SIR HERBERT&apos; tfADEER&apos;&apos; said that he had a list of all Iffil-FROM THE    the men available at Longmoor &quot;arid arrangements had been made SERVICES TO      to draft somebf these men to the G.W.R. and.S.W.R.    A WORK THE RAIL- certain.-number-of men&apos;- in &quot;the , Army&apos; could be released&quot; in WAYS. addition, and the list-was being, sent; him,     The&apos; Admiralty&apos;:    had some&apos; 150 or. 00 f;o&apos;&apos;Qd drivers and, ,f ireme ja and in reply to a question-a / &apos;....
2nd Sea lord stated Iha4 arrangements could be made for these men to he used.     It was stated that offers had been received from sailors and soldiers on leave who were drivers and firemen to work during their leave if the War Office had no objection.5* TRADE UNION6. VICTIMISATION.7. STOPPAGE OF LEAVE FOB SOLDIERS OVSRj-SEAS o8. CANCELLATION OF PROTECTION CERTIFICATES.THE ADJUTANT GENERAL said there would be no objection on the part of the War Offioe and that arrangements could be made for the men to have their leave on the termination of the strike.    It was also pointed out that if the places of strikers were taken by soldiers on leevo the effect would undoubfc-edly be very valuable.THE COMMITTEE decided(a) That it was of the greatest importance that men from the Services should start working on the railways.(bj That an appeal should be made in the Press for all experienced ex-railway workers now it civil life to come to the assistance of the railways during the strike.SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that he had spoken en the telephone to Mr.&apos; Thomas on the subject of the Trade Union Funds and that Mr, Thomas had assumed him that this money would not be used for the benefit of the strikers in any event.    Sir Albert informed the Committee that an injunction had been applied for and granted.It was reported that the men were asking on what conditions they could come back to work and SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that he had given instruction!; that they eould come back without any conditions so long as they returned before the time named in any notice which might be issued cancelling their protection certificates.THE ADJUTANT GENERAL stated that leave from the Expeditionary Forces had not yet been stopped. 6,000 men arrived in London yesterday from France. There were available for men on leave about 1,100 beds.    It was pointed out that the railway men on the S.W*R. had said that they would work trains for men on leave from Southampton but would work no troop   trains returning to that Port,THE. OOMITTEES decided :*That the question as to whether it was desirab to request the Field Marshal Commanding &apos; * Chi in France to issue orders cancelling leave for men from France should be deferred until the following day. )SIR HERBERT WALKER considered that the next move should be to send out the notices to-night cancelling the protection certificates from 9 a.m. to-morrow morning if the Committee approved.The Railway Bxecutive proposed that notices of (j) medical examination should be given to $ike effect within 24 hours and then the youngest men could be called up first and those which could be spared most easily.    The Executive did not want to be tied down to send in more &amp;as.es than could he spared.
KAJOB LLOYD GREAKB considered that it would be quite impracticable to call up the men to-morrow morning,&quot;   Sir Auckland Goddes proposed that a similar&apos; notice&quot;to that sent out from Coventry should be published and a time given within which the men must return to work.     Sir Auckland had suggested Monday next and tho Railway Officials would then send in a list of the men who did not report by mid-night of that day.     It was essential that the whole machinery should be ready to act directly, and immediately and to do this it was necessary,to make arrangements for dootcrs, accommodation for Medical Boards, etc. Major Lloyd Greame said..that Sir Auckland Geddes was strongly of opinion that the precedent of Coventry should be followed.     Major Lloyd Greame then read to the meeting a copy of the notice it was proposed to publish.   (Appendix).In answer to the objection that to put off the issue of the calling up notice till Monday, would seem to be an invitation to the men to stay out till &quot;Monday Major Lloyd Greame said that his department held the strongest views that it was most undesirable to name a date earlier than tnat on which the machinery could begin to operate *Questioned as to the provision of buildings necessary for medical examinations SIR WILLIAM ROBERTSON said, that he would issue the necessary orders to the competent Military Authorities to requisition the buildings and arrange transport as soon as he heard from the Ministry of National Service.SIR HERBERT WALKER said that the railways were not in a position to sp&amp;re any largo percentage of the locomotive drivers even if they did not return to work without complete dislocation of the whole railway system and suggested that the men should be taken for military service after their medical examination as circumstances permitted,(At this stage of the proceedings the Minister of National Service arrived.)SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES said that he &quot;thought it was undesirable to carry over for any lengthy period the date of notices, but would urge a, longer delay than 6 p.m. tomorrow for two reasons,(a) That there would be difficulty in getting the Railway Executive machinery and the National Service machinery to work,(b) That after a notice of this sort there was always a re-action and a resistance to the order but a vew hours of contemplation as to the results of remaining on strike had a very good effect.Ho therefore suggested NQgp on FRIDAY next as a suitable time and day to naming /tho notices but emphasised the fact that it must be clearly under-stood that if the men were called up they werecalled
called up for service with the Army and not only for medical examination and that it would he the worst thing possible once the notice was issued not to act strictly on it and take the men.     Sir Auckland Geddes said they were faced with facts and that no hrlf measures would succeed;   if this strike was not broken effectively there would inevitably be another on the railways and to use the Military Service Acts as a threat without putting them into operation would be to blunt the only weapon left to the Government by which means it could deal in any way effectively with these serious labour troubles.SIRSAJFAY said that he oould send from France some 13,000 railway mon but of course they would have to be replaced at their present duties before they could be noved.The Representatives of the Railway Companies present were&apos;generally agreed that it would be impossible to accept a situation in which perhaps $0% or more of the drivers and firemen would be taken for the Army, and pointed out that at least six months would have to elapse before the railways could be utilised to the full extent again if this happened.Various suggestions were put forward as to the possibility of taking a certain number of men by ballot, but Sir Auckland Geddes again emphasised the urgent necessity of not threatening to do anything which the Government did not intend to do fully for in this case all future strikes would have had the experience of thisl one.At this stage of the proceedings all the Members of the Committee left with the exception ofSir Albert Stanley Sir Auckland Geddes Major Lloyd Greame Sir David Shackleton Sir Herbert Walker Mr. P. Potter Sir Robert Turnbill Mr. I.T.Williama.After several suggestions had been made with a view to adding words to the notice which it was proposed to issue so that it would not be necessary for all the railway workers on strike to be called up at once SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that his own view was that it was inadvisable to send out the notices today. In view of the news which had been lately received it would be better &quot;to wait events and it might be that the strike would collapse without threatening the cancellation of the protection certificates.After considerable discussionMigMlL Gardens, S. W. 1.THE COMMITTEE decided(a) That the question of the issue of the notices cancelling protection certificates should be deferred until the following      ^ - day.(b) That the Minister of National Service should, makp all arrangements necessary in order tha action could be taken at once if it was decided to issue the notices.25&apos;th -September, 1Q1.R.
Certain men on tho Railways havo ceased work in disregard, and against tho advice, of their duly accredited leaders.     They have ceased work in an endeavour to force tho Government to change the national policy essential to tho  ro.se cut ion of tho War, whilst millions of their fellow-countrymen are hourly facing danger and death for their country. The men now on strike have hoen granted exemption f rom. thes&apos;7-- perils only because their services were considered of more value to the State on tho Railways than in the Army.It is now necessary for the Government to de-clare that all men wilfully absent from, their work on or after 1918; willbe doomed to have voluntarily placed themselves outside the special protection afforded to men employed on the R-ilways,     Their protection certifi-cates will cease to havo effect from that date and . they will become liable.to the provisions of the Military Service Acts.
