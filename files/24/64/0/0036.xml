Ssc (l      ieil ILx,J   &amp;I(This Document Is the Property0153AO.24Supplies to the United States Army. feroranjium by the Secretary of State for War.With reference to War Cabinet 4^6 (7), the War Office are of the opinion that the continuation by Great Britain of the policy of equipping the united states Army should prove to be not disadvantageous to this Country whilst at the same time it undoubtedly assists the cause of the Allies.     The reasons for this view are as follows(l)     Any contribution to the efficiency of the U*S. Array is so much gain to Great Britain, inasmuch as it tends to shorten the War.     The provision of suitable supplies must unquestionably increase efficiency.Our experience gained during the war enables us to provide tfce most suitable equipment on the most economical lines. To allow the Army Administrators to work their way - bycostly experimental expenditure - to the same degree of foresight and capacity as this country has attained, would be, it is submitted, both unwise and blameworthy.(2)     Expedition in the equipment of the U,s. Array helps to relieve the undue pressure of recruiting overhastily from amongst our older - and therefore less militarily fitted * industrial workers, with its inevitable consequence of disorgan-ising our manufacturing power whilst breeding discontent and pacifisnu(3]   -The fulfilment of the enormous bulk orders of the U.S. Army will stimulate and even compel new and more economical and successful methods of production, thus reducing the cost of our own supply, whilst creating precedents and practices in manufacture which will remain a permanent industrial asset to the nation.(4)     Difficulty is experienced in appreciating the argument that what is gained by reducing this Country! s indebtedness to the U.S.A. is lost by a corresponding increase in indebtedness to other countries, for the sale of the completely manufactured article cannot but mean a many-folif enhancement of the value of the Raw Material purchased.(5)     The suggestion that by discontinuing the manufacture of equipment for the U*S* Army our manufactories might be     % better employed in profitable civilian trade, is open to the reply that in all probability such a course instead of attaining the desired end of increasing exports would lead to increased manufacture for home consumption of articles not absolutely necessary and therefore wasteful; whereas every   of manufactured material now supplied to the U^S. Army is equivalent to a   of exports?(6)     It is further submitted that the factor of greatest iprnortance of a.11 to the country, 1* to keep the trade intact forpost
post war conditions.     So long as the productive machinery is maintained and kept going and sufficient raw material is available, Great Britain should be in a position immediately after the War to compete in any Work Market.steadying effect on prices is continued during the reconstruction period there should he little danger of the Uo8.A* acquiring new business at the&apos; expanse of this Country, more especially if the prices of raw material available in America are maintained at their present high level,(3)     If the shipping Controller finds difficulty to-day in delivering the requisite raw material, the position cannot but be greatly aggravated if there ,has to be transported in addition to the raw material necessary for increased civilian trade, equipment which has been manufactured overseas, instead of as at present in this Country,(9)     In conclusion, too much emphasis cannot be laid on the importance of accumulating a large stock of Raw Material in this Country, so that immediately on the termination of the War all energies may be diverted from the manufacture of War Material to that of civil manufacturedIf Government control of raw material with itsItlyth September, 1918.
