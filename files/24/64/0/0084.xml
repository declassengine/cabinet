G.T.-5781.THE LABOUR SITUATION. 12Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 25th September, 1918.Summary,Part I: General Remarks.The Inter-Allied Conference and the industrial position are discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on the allied successes; on foreign politics, with special reference to peace prospects, the Inter-Allied Conference, and Russia; on home politics, with special reference to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech; on Labour matters, with special reference to amalgamation; and on food, is described.Part III: District Reports.Unrest has rapidly become more serious, and is now almost general.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The strike on the railways, the trouble among shipwrights on the Clyde, among the platers&apos; helpers at Barrow, and the strike at Stevenson and Sons, Lower Tooting, are the most important stoppages of the week.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. The dispute in South Wales on the subject of an eight-hour day for surface workers is the most important dispute in progress.I.-General Remarks.The Inter-Allied Labour Conference.This Conference was held in London during the past week, commencing its sittings on Tuesday, the 17th, and closing on Friday, the 20th. It was mainly important as demonstrating the extreme divergence in type of view between the extreme right wing and the extreme left. A large amount of time was occupied with questions of voting and of procedure, none of which appear to have been authoritatively settled.The chief aim of the Conference was to arrive at an agreed statement of war aims, which should combine those accepted by the Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Con-ference of February 1918 and those now presented by the American Federation of Labour. This object was achieved, and it is reported that the main points of the combined declaration included the following : (i.) That the war is a conflict between autocratic and democratic institutions, (ii.) That Labour will do all in its power to assist the allied countries in drivingthe enemy out of the occupied territory, (iii.) That Labour will oppose the enemy forces so long as they obey their militaristGovernments.(iv.) That Labour accepts the fourteen propositions laid down by President Wilson, and that.the Allied Governments should adopt them in a joint declaration of policy.(v.) That Labour should be represented at the Peace Conference, and should hold a concurrent International Conference. .  (vi.) Deep regret is expressed at the reply of the German Majority Socialists^ which&quot;^creates an obstacle to the holding of an International Conference.&quot;[1100-48] B
Some of the points gave rise to very heated discussion, notably the first, which led to extremely hostile speeches by Mr. Kneeshaw and Mr. Maxton. It was finally accepted on a &quot;show of hands, the I.L.P. representatives, together with those of the French minority and of Serbia, abstaining from the vote.The last point was attacked by M. Longuet, on the ground that the reply of the German Majority Socialists was no obstacle to the immediate convocation of an Inter-nationale; by Mr. Gompers on the ground that there should be no meeting with enemy Socialists, in any case, daring the war. The point was, however, adopted, the United States and Canadian representatives abstaining from voting. One of the United States representatives then declared that, in the event of an International Conference being called during the war, the United States organisations would abstain from attending.Allied intervention in Russia &quot;was another question oh which the most widely divergent views were expressed and which engendered considerable heat. Ultimately a resolution was generally accepted, of the most non-committal kind, to the effect that &quot; the present effort of the Allied Governments to assist the Russian people must be influenced only by a genuine desire to preserve liberty and democracy in an ordered and durable world-peace, by which the beneficent fruits of the revolution shall be made permanently secure.&quot;On the question of the Austrian Peace Note,, the most important clauses of the Resolution ran as follows : &quot; This Conference is of opinion that the allied  Governments   would be assuming a heavy and perilous responsibility by adopting a purely negative policy. The Allied Governments in reply should make clear the identity of their views by close and continuous co-operation, and a public and collective declaration of their aims and intentions.&quot;The Conference has had very important results, apart altogether from the Resolutions at which it arrived. It is quite clear from observations since made in England by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and Mrs. Snowdeu, and in France by M. Longuet, that the inclusion of the American Federation of Labour has had a disruptive effect by accentuating the essential differences in policy between the left and right wings of the Labour and Socialist parties there represented. Hitherto every effort has been made at such meetings to gloss over and minimise these essential&apos;differences, but the American method clearly disapproves of the policy of the blind eye. It is recognition of this fact which led Mr. Ramsay Macdonald at the Annual Conference of the Scottish Labour Party to affirm his conviction that neither the French nor the Italians would join a conference on the same basis again.   .M. Longuet writes in the &quot; Populaire &quot; : &quot; I wish to point out at once that the resolutions, however insufficient on several points, are better than the atmosphere of the meeting, in which the old co-operative anti-Socialist Trade Unionism of England occupied an absolutely scandalous place flanked by some Jingo Irridentists and Reformists from Italy.&quot;It is to be regretted that the Italian official Socialists refused to attend the Conference, and that neither of the prominent American socialist parties was invited. It is also a misfortune that the Russian Revolutionary Socialist delegates were unable to be present.&apos; Even in their absence, however, the indications of disruption in policy were marked, and the effect of the Conference on the prospects of an early international meeting must be disappointing to the adherents of that idea. The opposition has &quot;been materially fortified by the entry of American Labour into the arena of internationalThe Industrial Position.Thp railway strike which broke out in South Wales on the 20th, and has since spread rapidly, overshadows other serious indications of unrest. That strike, at the time of writing, affects the Great Western, North-Western, South-Western, and to a certain extent the Great Eastern among the trunk lines. It is confined to the firemen and drivers, and is in direct opposition to the executive of their Union and to the policy of N.U.R. The strike is everywhere characterised as anarchic, and unanimous support of the action of the Government in its refusal to parley with the strikers is expressed.The latest news from South Wales indicates that the constitutional element among the men is gaining strength, and at a number of branch meetings the strike has been condemned.
Were it not for the spectacular and essential importance of the railway strike, the strike of shipwrights on the Clyde would attract more attention. It is of the first importance. This also is a strike against the advice and policy of Union officials. Attempts to induce the men to return to work as a preliminary to the hearing of their case by the Committee on Production have failed.The South Wales surfacemen threaten to strike at the end of this month in support of their demand for an eight-hours day.A reference to Parts III and IV of this report demonstrates that the industrial position, practically all over the country, is disturbed, and the contrast with conditions in April last is exceedingly marked.II. Press Comments.(A.)-Military.The Allied Successes. vThere is a remarkable absence of comment in the Labour press. The only reference to the Western front appears in the &quot; Call.&quot; Mr. Walton Newbold discusses the American advance into Lorraine, and draws the conclusion that the war will finish with the Americans in military occupation of the richest iron ore tract in the world. Thus, he concludes sarcastically, French iron and American gold will ensure liberty, democracy, and perpetual peace.(B.) Foreign Politics.Peace Prospects,,The receipt of the Austrian note has given an impetus to the discussion of the peace question, which largely excludes other topics. Most papers start with the thesis that Germany is beaten and knows it, though their conclusions diverge. The pacifist papers naturally demand immediate negotiations.In the &quot; Herald&quot; Mr. Robert Williams addresses an open letter to Mr. Barnes, forecasting revolution in the case of prolongation of the war, and calling on Mr. Barnes to induce the Government to take steps to meet the Austrian offer, or alternatively to renounce his support of the Coalition. In the same paper Mr. Brailsford calls attention to various predictions of a prolonged war, but is of opinion that in Germany politicians are moving rapidly towards the Left, which brings prospects of a reasonable peace nearer. In a leading article the paper presses strongly for open discussions, but would prefer secret discussions to none. The points at issue have not yet been clearly defined, and the present offer presents an opportunity for discussion. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; deplores Mr. Balfours speech, and praises that of General Smuts at Newcastle. It hopes that, through his influence, the present opportunity will not be allowed to slip. The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and the &quot;Call&quot; are not hopeful. They think that the real decision is in the hands of the pecple. &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Clarion&quot; take their usual view. In &quot;Justice&quot; Mr. Lee - describes the rake&apos;s progress of the German Social Democratic Party, while the &quot; Clarion&quot; thinks that peace will only come as fast as the American army does.Inter-Allied Conference.The Labour press of the week was published too early for comment on the actual proceedings, but neither the &quot;Herald&quot; nor the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; anticipated any satisfactory result, and the latter published an attack on Mr. Gompers. &quot;Justice&quot; prints the translation of an article by M. Thomas in &quot; Humanite,&quot; who considers that no international negotiations are possible until the German Socialists admit the existence of the Alsace-Lorraine and Posen problems.Russia.The &quot; Herald &quot; alone continues to support the Bolshevik Government. It suggests that documents recently published in America, which,show that Lenin and Trotsky are tools of Germany, are forgeries. &quot; Justice&quot; attacks the Bolsheviks, and calls upon British pacifists to throw off such bloodthirsty and unscrupulous scoundrels. The &quot;Clarion&quot; supports the request of the Russian Revolutionary Socialists for an inves-tigation into Soviet rule, and for allied intervention.
America.In the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington describes the peace movement in America as flourishing.India.In the same paper Mr. Ramsay Macdouald discusses the Montagu-Chelmsford report. He suggests the abolition of the Secretary of States Council, the appointment of two under-secretaries, one of whom should be an Indian, and arrangements to transfer political control from the Civil Service to elected legislatures.(0.) Home Politics.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Speech.Comments on the Premier&apos;s speech at Manchester are not illuminating. The &quot;Herald&quot; sums it up as full of vague promises and careful evasions. It amounts to a barefaced demand for a blank cheque. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot;commends the absence of any declaration of a &quot;knock-out&quot; policy, and approves the remarks about peace terms which, Mr. Snowden hopes, are&apos;intended as a ,rebuke to the Jingo press and politicians. This paper also agrees with the views expressed on internal developments. The &quot;Call,&quot; on the other hand, apparently reads the &quot;knock-out&quot; policy into the speech. &quot; Justice&quot; would ha ve^pref &quot;erred a short, clear statement on the military situation and domestic aflairs. Mr. MacLaine, in the &quot; Call,&quot;, makes a scurrilous suggestion as to the way in which opposition to the conferment of the Freedom of the City was overcome. He thinks there can be no element of decency in public life while Mr. Lloyd George remains in office.(D.)-Labour Matters.Amalgamation and Organisation.Few comments appear on purely Labour problems.The &quot; Herald,&quot; though not confident, expresses the hope that the York Com-mittee will succeed in its scheme for further amalgamation in the engineering trades. Discussing the solution of the police problem, it holds that recognition of the Union has not been secured. It regards the establishment of unity of interest between ordinary workers and public servants as essential, and thinks that to raise their status will increase the power and the economic strength of both.(E.)-Food.Consumers Council.In &quot;Justice,&quot; Mr. Hyndman&apos;s report on the Food Consumers&apos; Council again charges the farmers with profiteering. He recommends conscription of their property, as they have set an example by plundering the community. Disclosures about the mismanagement of tea are promised, and complaints about the price and quality of bacon and the occupation of a jam factory by the Air Board are mentioned.Co-operation.&quot; Justice&quot; describes the success of the Desborough Co-operative Society in managing a large farm and providing cheap milk, and recommends repetition of the experiment on a much larger scale.III. District Reports.The situation generally is very much disturbed. The railway strike has spread rapidly and wide areas are affected thereby.   The strike is dealt with in Part I.London and South-Eastern.The spread of the railway strike is already causing a considerable amount of dislocation in the metropolis. Discontent among certain other classes of workers is also evident in this district, although no serious disturbance has occurred.
There is considerable dissatisfaction among the cutters in London wholesale clothing factories over a recent award of the Committee on Production. They demand both for male and female workers 51. for a 50-hours&apos; week.Discontent still prevails at Cubitfs, both among the women and among the beltmen, millwrights&apos; mates, &amp;c. The stoppage of week-end work is causing some trouble among the workers at Graham White&apos;s Aircraft Manufacturing Company.The engineers at Park Royal are agitating for a shorter working week. Unrest is reported to be spreading among the women at Woolwich in connection with the proposal to establish a maximum wage and to shorten the working week.West Midlands.Some unrest is manifest in this area.At AustuVs, Birmingham, there is said to be still likelihood of a strike in connection both with the Dawes case and with a new case of stoppage of a toolmaker by a foreman on what are regarded as insufficient grounds, unless the firm takes steps immediately.It is reported that trouble is threatened at the Humber Works, Coventry, owing to the rejection by the Ministry of Munitions of a further engine bonus scheme drawn up by the firm.Enthusiasm in Dingley&apos;s case has waned, and there is little likelihood of drastic action being taken on his account.Yorkshire and East Midlands.There is considerable discontent in the area, especially among aircraft workers and engineers. &quot;The aircraft workers at Nottingham are reported persistently to resist dilution and piecework, and to be determined to take strong measures to secure an exorbitant hourly rate during the war and further concessions after the war.The agitation among the aircraft workers at Leeds has subsided.The workers at an aerial machine propeller factory in Leeds have succeeded temporarily in preventing dilution by women. The firm, however, insists on its right to employ female labour, and it is reported that trouble may arise at any time if an attempt in this direction is made.Discontent is spreading among the engineers in the Bradford, Keighley, and Leeds districts over the question of wages. There is also widespread disappointment at their failure to secure a reduction of working hours, for which they struck two months ago.It is reported that the majority of the railway workers in the Nottingham district are generally satisfied with the award. At Leicester, however, the men seem deter-mined to secure the 10s. rise.Unrest is beginning to revive among the boot and shoe operatives at Leicester and Northampton. Members of the Nottingham Miners&apos; Association are reported to be threatening to stop work to enforce the establishment of an eight-hours&apos; day for all colliery workers.The dispute at the Midland Railway Carriage Works, Derby, is over, the firm agreeing to pay double rates for Sunday work.North-WesternThe cotton spinners returned to work on the 23rd September. The Mersey Coalheavers have again struck in opposition to the advice of the officials of their Union.The railwaymen in the Liverpool district expressed, at a meeting on the 23rd, their strong disapproval of the award. They agreed then not to come out, but it is reported that they have now done so.It is reported that the. Mersey shop stewards are well satisfied with the progress so far made towards adoption of the new scheme for a General Council to replace the Reconstruction Committee.Trouble is threatened among the carpenters and joiners employed in the Liverpool aircraft industry over a demand put forward in August for the withdrawal of the existing system of payment by results. They are also protesting against the findings of the Joint Conciliation Board in connection with new and repair work.Northern.There is a decided revival of discontent in this area.[1100-481 C
IV. Disputes.^e general situation has b,epome particularly serious owing to the spread of the railway strjl^e.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The most serious of the stoppages reported by the Admiralty Labour Department is that of the. Clyde shipwrights, who ceased work on the 17th.The employers rejected the men&apos;s demand for a minimum wage of. 5/. per week. Both the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation and the Shipwrights&apos; Union are averse to the strike. The hearing of the case before the Committee on Production has been postponed until work is resumed.The blacksmiths and hammermen in the Leigh area, who struck Jast week, are still out.3.00 fitters and turners in the Humber Graving Dock ceased work on the 16th, owing to the dismissal of a fitter; a settlement was reached on the 18th.In the Liverpool district 200 ironmoulders have struck, demanding the 2s. Qd. increase per week granted to the ironrnoiilders engaged on marine engineering work.T!b.e iron, steel, and metal dressers in the same district have struck for a 2s. per week rise.Jn the 17th 300 platers&apos; helpers employed by Vickers in the Ejar^pw area ceased work, owing to the refusal of the firm to pay the difference between the platers&apos; and labourer?&apos; rate to, about twenty-five men who were put on to platers&apos; work during the latters&apos; holiday.        vThe Ministry of Munitions reports a total, of 5,308 pepple inyojvecl i,n strikes fPY the week ending the 18th September ; 1,304 \vere still out at the en4 of t^e week, anrj; five strikes remained unsettled.Three of the strikes reported last week have now been settled. At Heaton Chapel work was resumed, the men making no demand for a settlement before returning to work.  At Ebbw Vale the navvies have returned to work.  Wp.^ h,as, b,een resumed atThere is an agitation among the Durham miners for an eight-hours&apos; day for all surface workers and the abolition of the rules by which the minimum wage is calculate^ on the 1897 basis. Strong feeling exists on the subject, but there is no threat of a strike.The putters employed at various collieries owned by the Beaton Delaval Coal Company are demanding a higher minimum wage per day to make up for the serious diminution in their wages since the adoption of the eight-hqurs&apos; day. The employers refused to meet a joint deputation, and the men threatened to strike.The riveters, platers, holders up, and caulkers on the Tyne are demanding the 35 per cent, advance in wages already conceded to the boilermakers, on the plea that their work is of equal importance in shipbuilding.The Sunderland police have put forward a demand for increased wages.South W?MS-TJis strike; of railwaymen which began on the 20th has caused a general dislocation in this district, including the stoppage of the Ely Valley collieries.Demands for an extra 50 per cent, war bonus are being made by the dockers and riyer workprs in the Cardiff district.There is also unrest among the miners on the question of the immediate enforce] ment of an eight-hours&apos; day.Scotland.The unrest in the Clyde district has assumed a serious character.Many classes of workmen are beginning to demand higher wages, and it is reported that these agitations are likely jjo, cause as much local trouble as the demands for the 12jr per cent, bonus.The women&apos;s, demands, for equal pay for equal work&apos;1&apos; are said to be of a milder character, and trouble among them may perhaps be avoided by the appeal to their patriotism.At the Dundee and Firth, of Fort^ shipyards tl\e patternmakers and joiners are expected to come out in sympathy with the Clyde shipwrights.
Addlestone. The firm was informed that payment must be made to those who refused to clock.   It was, however, open to them to prosecute afterwards.The men employed by Messrs. Helsby and Co., Manchester, packing-case makers, have been on strike since the 10th, owing to the introduction of female labour.The Coal Controller reports twelve new stoppages, ten of which are in the ^[pr$iern district.With reference to the strike at the Mill Close Lead Mines, certain agreements arrjved at between the owners and the men&apos;s representatives were submitted to the men on the 24th, and it ]p nQW hoped that a genera] stoppage at the mines will be averted.The Durham Miners&apos; Association has regained control over the men at the Dean and Chapter Colliery, and work was resumed there on the 23rd.On the 20th the whole of the Seaton Delaval Company&apos;s collieries were idle, but the men resumed work on the 23rd.   The case is. referred to in Part III.The War Office Contracts Department reports one new stoppage.At Stevenson and Sons, Lower Tooting, about 600 women have struck, owing to the dismissal of a woman who had recently become a member of the Workers&apos; Union. This union does not sanction the strike, and no strike pay is being given.Reported from other sources.The most important strike is that of the railway men; it is reported that the Great Western line is most seriously affected, while local stoppages have ocourred on the London and North-Western, the London and South-Western, and the Midland lines. The strike is dealt with in Part I.About 360 wood and metal workers were out at the Wells Aviation Company&apos;s Works, Chelsea, in protest against the dismissal of a discharged soldier. The strike had practically ceased by the 19th September.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.Several controversial cases are reported by the Admiralty Labour Department.The anglesmiths&apos; strikers in the Tyne district threaten to stop work owing to a wages dispute.In the Belfast area, owing to a demarcation dispute between the shipwrights and joiners at Harland andjWolffs and Workman Clark&apos;s, the fitting-up of magazines has been stopped pending a settlement.The labourers, carpenters, and bricklayers at Pollock and Sons, London, are demanding the 12  per cent, bonus.The employees at Lloyd!s Proving Houses, Tipton, demand 3s. qd. advance. If these strike it is expected that the employees at Netherton and Cradley will join them.The Ministry of Munitions reports a number of controversial cases.About 1,000 women in the Nottingham area threaten to strike over the non-payment of the 5s. advance in the first week of September.The women employees at High Wycombe, who are alternately employed on chairs and on aircraft work, threaten to strike on aircraft work if they are not given a higher rate for chair-making.A dispute is in progress between the firm of Messrs.

The Controller has arranged a conference on the subject, to be attended by owners and miners.The War Office Contracts Department reports one new case.The hosiery workers at Littleborough, near Rochdale, an important centre of the industry, demand a 30 per cent, advance in wages; two firms engaged in War Office contracts are affected.The dispute of the hosiery workers at Belfast reported last week has been referred to the Ministry of Labour, and a stoppage is likely to be averted.The unrest in the clothing trade, reported last week, continues.The Committee on Production last week heard sixty-five cases in London and eleven at Newcastle on-Tyne.TheBe included (1) several applications from the shipwrights and boiler-makers on the Tyne, Blyth, and Ware district for an advance of 35 per cent.
o(2) An application from the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, the A.S.E., and the Electrical Trades Union to the Executive Railway Committee for 100 per cent, advance on pre-war rates.(3) An application from the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a 5*. advance for its members employed on all commercial and motor work.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports a record number of 226 new differences, 26 of which were claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus. The national claim j!of the gas workers is to be discussed on the 24th instant.The question of the recognition of the Firemens Union has formed the subject of an important award.D. J. SHACKLETON(for the Minister, who is absent from London).
