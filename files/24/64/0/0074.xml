(THIS DOdUIIBir? IS THE PROPERTY.,gF HIS^BRIJTAmriC^Jg^TY.1 S^OVERKllgiT^Confidential.G,T. 5771.WAR HABI3TO, ITUATION IK RUS3IA.Opy of a stopped Telegram, dated September 22nd, 1918 from a Mr. Falk at yiadivoBt^ ^ail^.^n^r0YltWhat.is happening here is a microcosm of what is happening throughout the war, explaining why with superior resources the Allies have not yet beaten Germany.   We are all at loose ends.   One Ally pursues one policy and another another. There is no contraction into a common channel and when you inquire the reason you are told to address yourself to Washington, or some other Allied capital.   The result is an inglorious impasse or at best a miserable delay.   Yet outwardly everybody is polite for what matters,another two years added to the war so long as manners remain unimpeachable ?   If&apos;all the,Allies are sincere in their professions, the restoration of a Russia ultimately strong enough to stand by herself is an obvious necessity.   A restored Russia implies a Russian Army of not negligible proportions.   V/hat do we find - either the Allies damning the idea with faint praise or quarelling under whose auspices the work of recruiting is to be done.   Mention recruiting and you realise what wonderful camouflage the daily exhibition of exquisite politeness is.   Ditto almost every proposal until the whole thing is visualised as a gigantic comedy.   Unfortunately while this comedy is being staged the blood of our race Is being outpoured in France and what is of more immediate concern, to the Far East the Czie^h Army valiantly fighting to retain a foothold for the Allies from the Volga to the Japanese Sea is being gradually thinned and the forlorn hope which they had transfigured into a vision of splendid promise is being driven ominously towards an acute tragedy.   Meanwhile we are making rare progress with Bible Athletic classes and have even captured the 14 ye.ar old son of Horvat in this soul-saving net, moreover If we cannot send the Czech men we can at least send them chocolate and condensed milk&apos;.   The harsh voice of Gaida breaks into this symphony of exquisite sensibility with a peremptory demand for immediate military as distinct frcia dietary help from tUe Allies and.the immediate inauguration of a Russian army and *sv recruiting scheme which is quite shacking the Allied rep.re-sentatives who are coding and de-coding official messages with the air of men who are too well trained ever to get excited Or to be in a hurry,   v/e know the frejmans are on the ?olga but we are too polite to enquire v/hy so many Allied troops are on the ?   where. Ludendorff doesn^t care ^ fig what we do.   1$ the Allied demonstration.of co-operative working, does not encourate you much less does ,the display of Ru*wjjyan. pft4^rio^ij^ in these parts..   Officers.with, medal decorated brenato spend their days promenading Svetiandskaya, the-local Regent. Street, content with the role of squires of dames, while the Mlk of the population is either emulating their example or *.,ting and drinking..   Western Siberia we are told is different, let us hope so..   Of course nothing can be done to these swaggering, officers the cridn of whose medals /
(SdV)   Falk,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.. 24th September, 1918.I shrewdly suspect is the local lombardy otherwise pawnshop except to distinguish between them and fighting officers by the issue of a special badge .or uniform,and as regards the guzzling civilians it would be waste of time to bother about them,   But something is possible with the youth of Siberia on condition of their being removed from the degrading atmosphere (i\f the SvetlandsJsya gallants and food-hogs which they understand to be the vital part *f the British recruiting scheme,   Still, what is the good of any scheme so long as the Allies are employed in sold douching one another&apos;s efforts and generally playing the fool.    Y/ere the Allies possessed of one mind in this interesting business they would already havo had their troops on the Volga and have arranged for more of those 44 Japanese divisions for looking for something to do to get nearer the Germans.   They would have a recruiting scheme for the Russian youth in full blast and. they would have Siberia ablaze with the right kind of propaganda which means spending money freely.   You&apos;cannot undo. Germany&apos;s very efficient &quot;Missionary&quot; work with a few five-pound notes no matter However., gifted your, agents may be.   Finally if the Allies wore as sufficiently brought to commonsense here as they have been in France under the stress of terrible danger they would now bo well advanced with a coherent compact co-operative plan for turning Gaida*s amazing achievement to account, .&apos;P.S.   News comes that we may expect two hundred more social workers.   Western Siberia may be lost but we shall have turned out some excellent young Russian athletes and completed a system of pleasant Thursday afternoons.
