OOIJPIDEtJTIAL.Sept, 16, 1918,Political Intelligence Department. Foreign Office , Japan -/OOlU E M 0 E A-H D U Mon&quot;JAPANESE   M-ASIATICISM   AND   SIBERIA.I The purpose of this Memorandum is to attempt to reach some con-elusion with regard to Japanese designs in Siberia.    These are considered in the light of Japanese pan-Asiaticism. and reasons ere given for   believing that the primary Japanese Imperialistic aims &quot;are directed elsewhere than towards Siberia^!A* The Japanese Conception, Of Pan-Asiatiotsm.The relation of Japan to Siberia ought probably to be con-sidered in the first instance in the light of a larger issue,conception here is that of Asia for the Asiatics under the hege-mony of Japan.     It is an idea that has received a great impetus during the war. Particularly as the result of reflection upon the probable course of events in the East after the war.     It is promulgated in varying degrees of intensity by political writers and other authorities in different spheres of public life..   Por obvious reasons it cannot be openly adopted by the P-ov eminent, al-though it occasionally seems to lie in the mental background of the statements and activities of individual ministers.     But it can be presented through the medium of magazine and   newspaper&quot;, articles, and in this way a public opinion can be created which may in the end force the hand of the Government, particularly in con-nection with the approaching termination of the Anglo-Japanese . alliance.     The whole attitude demands oureful consideration.&quot;After the European war, Asia will become 4&quot; field of inter-national rivalry among the ^owere, and the future destiny of thenamely, that of Japan and Pan-Asiaticism generally.     The leading
world will &quot;be decided by the awakening of the myriads who throng this great arena. - Japan tos the first among the nations of the East to receive enlightenment; it is her duty to help and guide those nations which are akin to her.. From the day when Japan joins hands with China and establishes cordial relations with India., interests of a far-reaching nature will spring up throughout the inlands of the southern seas and Central Asia. . Consequent upon this the trade and commerce of the whole of Asia will advance by leaps and bounds&quot;..In terms such as these are set forth in part the scope and objects of a Pan-Asiatic Industrial Association founded in Yokohama in Hovember 1917.In &quot;&quot;any cases the treatment of the subject is more crude and uncom-promising.&apos;.    &quot;The mission of the Japanese Empire consists in carrying out the Asiatic Kunroe Doctrine in the most complete manner.     By this Asiatic IfuSroe Doctrine we mean the principle that Asiatic affairs should be dealt with by Asiatics.......,\7e do not hold so narrow-mindeda view as to wish to drive the whites out of Asia.     What we want is simply that we become independent of   the whites-....,... ..The.AsiaticITunroe Doctrine is the principle of Eastern autonomy, that is, ofOrientals dealing with Eastern questions,.......It is clear as lightthat the above theory will be receiver by the whites with anything but favour, but world affairs cannot always be settled to the advantage of the whites, nor were we born to serve the whites.&quot;     3o Jfr. Tokutomi, chief editor and proprietor of the &quot;Zokumin Shimbun&quot; and Crown Member of the House of Peers.     It is along this line that the attempts are made to come into sympathetic association with the aspirations of Indian native politicians. .   &quot;The preliminary condition for the realisa tion of Pan-Asiaticism&quot;,. says the editor of the most powerful evening paper in Tokio in a. wild article in &quot;Chuo Koron&quot; (&quot;Central Review&quot;, April,. 1917),.. &quot;is in reality a change of jurisdiction in India.    Js it
not. India-which... constitutes the foundation of the real power of Great Britain, the invader of Asia/?    Economically ana militarily con-sidered, would not Great Britain, divorced from India, become a-4third-rate Power, as already stated by Lord Curzon?   Imagine theadvent of the age of the political connection, the unification ofthought, the economic alliance and religious sympathy of India, Chinaand Japan.    What white-man principles and occidentalism, what nationalprinciplesgreed-of-gain/could then bring calamity upon Asia&quot;.In its extreme form the movement encourages and harbours agents of Indian Sedition and Home Rule aspirations in the hope that the people of India will throw off British control and turn towards Japan as the leader and natural protector of the Oriental races, with the fesult that the Japanese will obtain important commercial advantages.     (See Memorandum on Japan and Indian Sedition. 10998)The Japanese interest in China also receives its partial explana-tion along these lines.     &quot;The weakness of China is a perpetual source of dtanger to Japan.   The development and progress of Asia re-quire harmonious relations between Japan and that country, and Pan-Asiaticism must be the guiding principle to regulate these relations. Japan may find it her inevitable task to lead that nation to stability j though she must never have territorial, and other ambitions.&quot;    So Count Otani in the &quot;Central Review&quot;.Kr. 17akamiya, a distinguished sociologist and editor, takes up another aspect of this complicated   question.     &quot;Westerners excludeAsiatics wherever possible.....Either Asiatics must submit to thewill of the westerners or strike out for themselves a great Asiatic oolicy to restrain the Westerners......... Japan is in a state of 5so-lation :   her salvation lies in establishing this great policy for Asia&apos;as well as for herself.&quot;    \7ith this may be collated in particular the Japanese dfcsire for entry into,Australia, being, as allies, proper-ly qualified in their estimation to enjoy equal treatment with other first-class States in this respect.    The particular wish expressed in this connection is for closer economic relations.
Again Dr. Sawayanagi, a former I minister of Ec&quot;uc:.tion, writes last &apos;-year in the If. rquis Okum:) * s magazine &quot;Shin Nippon&quot; (New Jo pan):   &quot;Ideem it almost imperative for the Japanese people to stand by &quot;hat may&quot;be termer the Asiatic principle based on peaceful ideas of civilizedPan-Asiaticism.     Pan-Asiaticism may embrace, India, Persia, Siam andAnnam as well as China.     But as this would extend its scope too far,other countries except China may well be excluded from it.   In order toadminister Eastern affairs in conjunction with China, Japan must securethe development of her science and civilisation to such a degree as towin the sonfidence of the Chinese people&quot;.Interest in the problem of 0an-Asiaticism sometimes breaks out alongIunexpected lines.     So l?r. Inukai, leader of the national *^arty of Japan, in e speech delivered in Feb. 1917 is surprized at the decision of the Allies that Turkey should be permanently   ousted from Europe. This is tantamount to declaring that, though the whites were at liberty! to own territories in Asia and Europe, the yellow race is to bo denied similar privileges in Eurooe.    Accordingly &quot;for the safety of Japan from future complications of the world politics and for the sake of the cause of Pan-Asiaticism, Japan must be determined to annex the   South Sea Islands&quot;.     Finally, Dr. Hosufce ftagasa, who is connected with the General Staff of the Japanese army,, remo-rles in an article also in the &quot;Shin Nippon&quot;:   &quot;Japan participated in the present war not on account of any nebulous sense of justice or defence of principle, but from the necessity of protecting her interests as an independent State.     Japan therefore ought to demand from the Allies a voice in the disposal of the Ottoman Empire....... If their (the Entente Allies) attitude is basedI upon racial prejudice, arid this is the real reason wh  the Turkish raceImust not be allowed to hold territory amorg European races, we must protest in the most emphatic manner.   In whatever way this European war may be terminated, this question of the disposal of the Ottoman Empire will certainly come up for discussion at the Peace Conference.
\On that--*KKxasiaa*. Japui &quot;fch        rtypre^eiTtafciy* oi the- Asiaticrace, and in my opinion it is the duty devolving upon this country to speak on behalf of the Turk on that occasion, if hot to claim the emancipation of the whole Asiatic race.&quot;The general drift of these._anaamij.ar articles gives the impression that while the writers feel it to be improbable that the Asiatic peoples will unite on mere cultural or religious bases against the aggression of the Western nations, yet it is conceivable that they will make a common cruse to preserve their political and economic interests in their own respective countries.     In this initial state of the development of Pan-Asiatieism it3 activity can be little more, however, than merely resistant.    But   just in so far as the ideas, prevail in the East that Western civilization has proved itself&quot;bankrupt&quot; - to use some of the other phrases of such writers - that &quot;the spirit ef occidental civili-zation is depredation&quot;, and that the &quot;indirect cause whicjj calls for the institution of Pan-Asiaticism is the exceeding untrustworthiness of Western civilization&quot;, will the movement attempt to take on a more active and positive character.    Realisation of the ideal of Pan-Asiaticism is, however, clearly seen to depend more on the realisation of a free and strong Chins than on anything else, and for tl?is reason far-sighted Japanese statesmen are supposed to be very keenly interested in the institution of friendly relations between China and Japan and the strengthening China by Japanese co-operation.How widely s-ich views are held can only be accurately gauged by those who are on the spot.     Certainly such opinions as Dr. Hagasa&apos;s on Japan1s entry into the war would appear to be exceptional.     &quot;I honestly believe&quot;, wrote Saito Itan in &quot;The Japan Advertiser&quot; of Feb. 1st, 1918 - a member of the staff &quot;who has a keen judgement of Japanese human nature but who has never been out of Japan&quot; - &quot;that the most intelligent thought of the most intelligent people is represented by the Government in holding/that Japan has joined her issue with the righteous cause and that Germln militarism is a menace to the peace and civili-zation of the world that must be destroyed,     There are many Japanese
&apos;7bo do not think so, and they attract attention only &quot;because they are exceptional, not beoause they are representative or believed to be right On the other hand he believes that the mass of the Japanese people &quot;certainly think nothing at all about the war&quot;.     They do not feel that it is their business;   it is a war nf the white peoples.&quot;The danger,&quot; says another&apos;political and economic writer, Dr. Washio, in the same number of the Japan Advertiser, &quot;is that Japan has too much wiBdom and her heart is shrivelled.     Suspicious about the real motive of this war and overwhelmed by the gigantio resources and unprecedented human ingenuity that are put into it. we have lost courage and initiative and are inclined to shut ourselves within the limits of the Far East&quot;.A more direct challenge and criticism of the Japanese Pan-Asiatae point of view is furnished by Dr. Sakuzo Y^shino, Professor of Inter-national Law and Politics in the University of Tokio, in a long article in the &quot;Toyo Jirdn&quot; (&quot;Eastern Review&quot;) for January 1918, in the course o which the following observations are made:   &quot;Owing to the fact that Oriental races, especially &quot;fee Chinese, are somewhat hostile to the Japanese and do not readily join hands with them, the latter have preached racial oppression by the white races and have advocated Pan-Asiatic principles fofc the purpose of uniting the Oriental races.     In this sense Pan-Asiaticism is a kind of anti-foreign conception, a plan to sow dissension by forcing the union of the yellow races against the white as a common enemy.&quot;Although at first sight this idea of racial oppression may sound reasonable enough,, it has in the first place no logical basis.    Racial distinctions are a relic of barbarous times which are being swept away in the advance of civilization.    The hostility of one race to another has up to the present sprung not directly from racial difierences hut from dissimilarity of religion, customs, etc., resulting therefrom. Consequently racial conflicts in the past have been between races whichwere comparatively close&quot;,     icr. Yoshino does not say that the differen-of lifeces of belief and ideals/which exist between the races of the East and
West allow &quot;of complete harmony- between., them, but he maintains that it would be an absolute mistake to imagine that for reasons of purely raoial difference, all the white races whould, oblivious of their olif conflicts of interests, combine together to overthrow the yellow races. Moreover, speaking from actual circumstances, he maintains that although some Japanese hold this prejudiced view at the present day, very few Indians or Chinese espouse it,     ?he latter are more cosmopolitan than the Japanese, and closer to the English and Americans.     For these reasons the principles of a Great Asia in this sense will not easily gain acceptance among the Indians and Chinese.     The fundamental pria-cinle of a Pan-Asiaticism capable of uniting the Oriental races is that it must stand on a basis broad enough to allow of concerting with Europeans and Americans also.     The supremacy of Japan in the Orient he finds to be dae so far to two circumstances only- &quot;our quick adoption of Western civilisation&quot;, and &quot;the stability of our Government, which is based upon the long unbroken tradition of etr fe^ci-iT:! Cyr.asty and the people&apos;s Royalty to it&quot;.     But neither of these circumstances indicates, he thinks, that the Japanese have any superior civilisation that they can hold up to other Oriental countries as an example to be followed by them.     &quot;Our Government may be strong, but as a nation on a democratic basis we are not yet in a positio   to teach other peoples&quot;. &quot;Additional quotations from translation of article as given in The Japan Advertiser, Jan. 18th, 1918),Most   frank of all is an article by Dr. Notobe in the July number of &quot;Shin Nippon&quot; (New Japan&quot;) for   this year, from which the following characteristic sentences may be quoted:     &quot;Japan was. not sufficiently generous in supplying that country (America) with shipping...... Itmust be admitted that she (Japan) has created in the Allies&apos; mind a deep impression that she is. not made of th   same stuff as the other members of the group&quot;.     Notwithstanding her bounden duty, &quot;she some-times betrays an inclination to join hands with Germany in an alliance
und plays o double-faced game when the war undergoes any marked change, While professing her determination to crush German militarism, she is secretly concocting militaristic schemes of her own.     Such behaviour must give the other Allies the impression that&apos; -Japan is not a reliablefriend.......In short it is my opinion that the attitude of Japan to-wards the prosecution of the war is marked by Insincerity.     Though a -belligerent, she has made use of the war to reap great economic profits, and from the military point of view has occupied a position analogous to that of a neutral country when compared with the heavy sacrifices in lives that the European Allies are making&quot;.     As regards Jaoan&apos;s view of the war &quot;it is in some respects inexcusable in a member of the Allied : group&quot;.    . Dr. Hitobe thinks that the Allies will reject the Japanese terms at the Peace Conference as incompatible with her sacrifices.I.     Japanese War Aims and Siberia.It is of interest that the conclusions drawn by Dr. Hitobe in the above-quoted article had their origin in a discussion of Japanese war-aims and peace terms.     After pointing out how Japan&apos;s principal services to the Allies consisted in (a) clearing $singtan of German influence, (b) securing sea power in the Pacific and clearing it of the O-erman navy, (c) remaining faithful,to the Anglo-Japanese.Alliance - another writer suggests that Japan might very well have played the part of Italy in relation to the Triple Alliance - and so helping in the preservation of peace in India, (d) sending her navy to the Mediterranean to co-operate and (e) giving financial aid to Russia and Prance, he states that in return Japan will demand the absorption of Tsingtau and certain South Sea Islands, and the recognition of her special rights and inter-ests in China.     Thereafter he proceeds to state his fear that the sac-rifices of Jaoan will not appear commensurate with such demands in the eyes of the Allies,     It is very probable that some such fear has played its part in determining Japanese intervention in Siberia.
C!) PIIn relatio   to the Question of Siberia it is worth while examining a few of the most representative statements by Japanese ministers on Japanese war-aims,&apos;    Thus Baron ftoto in.an Interview in The Japan Advertiser, Feb. 27th, 1918:  .&quot;Japan&apos;s war-aims remain what they were declared to be when she entered the struggle in 1914, namely, to en-sure the peace of the Orient and tb fulfil the obligations of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance&quot;.,With regard to China, Viscount Ishii, speaking in New York on Sept;. 29th, 1917, is reported to have said:   &quot;The policy of Japan with regard to China has always been the. same story:   we want good govern-ment which keeps peace, security and the development of opportunity in China......At no time in the past, and at no time in the future, didwe, or will we, seek to take,territory from China or to despoil China of her rights.     Not only will we not seek to assail the integrity or sovereignty of China, but ^e shall eventually be prepared to defend and maintain the same integrity and independence of China against any aggressor&quot;.Viscount Motono in a speech in the Imperial Diet, Jan.23rd, 191 , referred to the special position which Japan occupies in certain re-gions of China, especially in Southern T-Tanchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia:   &quot;If Jaoan has a special position in these regions it is olewcly due to the immense sacrifices and incalculable efforts &quot;hich she has made, and it is in consequence of this that she. has acquired these rights and interests which have been consecrated by treaties and agreements&quot;., Much might be quoted&apos;along similar lines, but the point of interest is that there has1never been any specific reference to possible de-mands in connection with Siberia.,.   In fact, on Farch 26th, 1918, Viscount Motono spoke as follows:   &quot;It is also unnecessary to state that should the condition of affairs in Siberia threaten the safety of Japan or endanger frer vital interests? Japan is determined to take
\10.prompt measures of self-defence to meet the emergency, even should this -country he compelled to take necessary action in Siberia.     Hot only is there no intention of treating Russia as an enemy, hut an ag-gressive policy of the kind now being pursued by Germany in Russia would never be adopted.     Iloreover this country will never cease to feel the most profound sympathy foi? the whole Russian people and to desire to maintain friendly and cordial relations with it.&quot;    The re-markahle thing is that while tb?re are hardly ever any references to a desire for acquisitions in connection with Siberia, very blunt state-ments appear from time to time with regard to other parts of the world, for example Annam.     Thus an article in &quot;The Japan Advertiser&quot; for Feb. 7th, 1918 makes the interesting comparison that Japan occupied Formosa more than twenty years ago and has settled 140,000 Japanese there, wheras the French have had Annam for thirty years,and to-day there are less than 20,000 French living there.     With the exception of the construction of the Haifong-Yunnan railway and the building of two or three cities, France has done nothing with regard to Annam, and cannot be considered as serious in her ambitions there.     The article &amp;oes on to point out that Annam could he reached in four or five days from Formosa and concludes in this strain&quot;;     &quot;For colonisation purposes no country in the south is more conveniently situated, to the interest Of the country tha ^nnam.     Though we entertain no aggressive ambition on any other nation&apos;s territory, vre may seriously consider if it would he possible for us to obtain the privilege of colonisation in exchange for the garrison duty which the French Government has al-ready shown an inclination to entrust to our hands&quot;.     The extension of Japanese influence in the Pacific and South Seas und the expansion of the Japanese Colonial Empire at the expense of the Dutch Bast Indies and of British, French and American Colonial possessions in those regions, is more to their mind than the pcssession of territory in Siberia.     The &quot;Memorandum on the Press in the Dutch Colonies&quot; (81304) shows that a programme of quiet penetration with the Japanese Government behind it is being carried on there.
&quot;Wth-Tegard-to, Wmia^ly^im^o&amp;e^a^ -occasionally be jio%i&amp;6&amp;MP*x&amp; Japanese press to the necessity trf inaJUiig^nAdirvosl^ ^jrpen,,wrt&quot;f and it is probable that a demand will be made for the northern port of the island of Sak&amp;Oin *rh* * wrm-hn^ ] J-^hnff-&quot;^1^^Tlg-prt&quot;J1*a**0*the island.    This would also give Japan full control of the Straits separating that country from the mainland, u move which can be best met by assisting the Russians in the construction of the contemplated railway in the direction of the Behring Straits, to connect with the corresponding one which the Americans will build on the other side. This with the protection of the fishing and mining rights already **6-quired, together with the $inking of Japanese capital and the employment of Chinese labour, are the lines of peaceful penetration that Japan will probably be content with applying to Siberia.    All the indications seem to point to China being the real Japanese aim.    Eastern Siberia la torn far to the north, and land cultivation there is a question of extensive farming, wheras the Japanese practice intensive farming,   onithe other hand, now that Japan has got into Eastern Siberia, she may-[refuse to withdraw ujbtil she gets some equivalent in recognition of priority of ocmmerelal and industrial rights in China.    The current phraoe of her desires with regard to China is :   &quot;We wish to solidify tBhlna&quot;.     She realises that territorial aggrandisement at the eapense If China is out of the question, not being in harmony with the spirit if the age, but she wishes to be in a position to be the prinoipal loaner of money to China and so secure industrial control over her. the sees that no nation can be a Great Power to-day without coal and iron resources, and she particularly wishes to secure the first aocess to the ininero1 wealth of China.   - It is probably from such ultimate Joint of view that the recent Sino-Japanese Treaty (llareh 25, 1918) lught to be regarded, involving financial, commercial and military lontrol over China amounting in practice to a protectorate.
