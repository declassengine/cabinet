-t^c^- (This Document Is t he Property of ^     \ 7&apos;&apos;His Britannic iVlaJestv&apos;s Government)UlMINISTRY   OF   S H I P PI N 0,A NATIONAL SETTLEMENT WITH LABOUR: MEMORANDA BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL MARITIME BOARD.
A national Settlement With Labour:   Memorandum by the Chairman of the National Maritime Board,This is a suggestion that an attempt should forthwith be made to arrive at a national settlement with Labour, and it Is inspired by what appears to be the large elementiol success vihich has attended the formation in the United States of a National Viar Labour Board working in detail to give effect to certain general and generous principles. It is submitted that the establishment here of a representative board could not fail to have a favourable influence and that the only doubt as to its great success lies in the fact that a measure of the kind has been too long delayed,   Such a scheme would mean the winding up of the Committee on Production, which was established by the Munitions of War Act, and the members of which were appointed by the Treasury. This, of course, is to make no reflection upon the extraordinary amount of valuable detailed work which has been accomplished by that body in the most difficult circumstances.The National &apos;,:!ar Labour Board here contemplated would be thoroughly representative of employers and employed.   On the employers&apos; side it would be composed of members elected by the great trade associations.   On the employees 1 side It would be equally representative of&quot; organised labour,   As to both employers and employed certain nominations might be made by the Government to secure proper representation of unorganised industries.   Reference to such an authority of all labour controversies which could not be settled by other means would, it is suggested, bring to bear upon any
lit,dispute a representative body of opinion which would help the disputants to realise the national point of view, and be a corrective of sectional views.If such a body existed at the time these words are written, September 19th., it would surely serve a very great purpose. There are pending disputes arising out of great claims made by three different bodies of workers, viz. railway men, seamen, and transport workers.    The claims made by these three groups of workers are very dissimilar in character^ and ordinary methods, (in the case of the seamen even the existence of the National Maritime Boards a sort of Vflaitiey Council), have failed.    If these three matters were under the consideration of a properly representative Labour Board the claims could be co-ordinated and a settlement probably reached in which even-handed justice would be done.      For on the National War Labour Board there would be qualified representatives of employers and employed in all the industries directly and Indirectly affected, who would see all round the issue.The American national settlement arose out of a conference held in March 1918 which was composed of six representative employers and six representative workmen, with ex-President Taft as chairman.    As the result of this conference the American National War Labour Board was formed &quot;to try to settle by mediation and conciliation all controversies having any relation to war or other national -activities&quot;.Certain principles were laid down by this agreement to guide and govern the Board!s activities, as follows1.    There should be n* strikes or look-outs during the war.
m   3fc.     The right of workers to organise in trade unions and to bargain collectively through chosen representatives, is recognised and affirmed.3.    The right of employers to organise in associations or groups and to bargain collectively, is recognised and affirmed,4.    Employers should not discharge workers for membership in Trade Unions, nor for legitimate Trade Union activities,5.    The workers, in the exercise of their right to organise shall not use coercive measures to induce persons to join their organisations, not) to induce employers to bargain or deal therewith.6.    In establishments where union and non-union men and women now work together, and the employer meets only with employees and representatives engaged in said establishments, the continuance of such conditions shall not be deemed a grievance.7*    If it shall become necessary to employ women on work ordinarily performed by men, they must be allowed Qqual pay for equal work, and must not be allotted tasks disproportionate to their strength.*     8.    The basic eight-hour day Is recognised as applying In all cases in which existing law requires it. In other cases the question of hours of labour shall be settled with due regard to governmental necessities and the welfare, health and proper comfort of the workers.3.    The maximum production of all war industries should be maintained,10.    The right of all workers, including common labourers, to a living wage is hereby declared,11,    In fixing wages, minimum rates of pay shall beestablished which will ensure the subsistence of the worker and his family in health and reasonable comfort.0n April 8th. the President of the United Statesconcurred in the recommendations of the conference, and theLabour Board has since been at work with excellent results.I have been furnished with the following usefulcomparison of the main provisions of this American agreementand our Treasury agreement, of March 1915,    Common to both are:(a)   the recognition of Trade Unionism and Collective Bargaining,
* 4 . 1(b)   the prohibition of victimization,(.c)   the maintenance of Trade Union standard rate,(d) the discontinuance of all practices delaying or restricting production,(e) the admission of new classes of labour, including women, to work hitherto monopolised.The provisions of the American plan which differfrom ours are:(a) the supreme arbitration authority which is to settle all disputes, press on employers proper conditions, and when appealed to, authoritatively fix the rate of wages, is not a Government official or committee, but an impartial, unofficial neutral chairmanj(b) women on tasks ordinarily performed by men are to be given equal pay for equal work;(c) recognition of the necessity for a living wage and therefore of &quot;minimum rates of pay which will ensure the subsistence of the worker and his family in health and reasonable comfort.&quot;These three points are each of importance and it is suggested that they should be incorporated in the British plan here suggested.    As to (a), if a British National War Labour Board were established with a representative of Labour as Chairmen, an employer as Vice-Chairman, and for the rest equally representative of employers and employed, its decisions would command confidence and respect in labour circles.    As to (b) a declaration established &quot;fry the principle of equal pay (for equal work) for men and women would command almost universal approval, as is evidenced by every comment on the recent bus-strike.   As to (c) in addition to a declaration of principle a concrete minimum might be worked out.Another principle might be recognised with great advantage, and that Is the reconsideration by the Board of
1 n 11c jIt has been remarked that the effect of such a Board in America has been all for good.   According to a Press correspondent of my acquaintance, Mr, P.W.Wilson, the American authority has helped to create a spirit in the ranks of American labour which is much to be desired here. He tells us that 8,000 shipwrights of Los Angeles have decided to work one Sunday a month for four months to increase output, and to give the wages earned by their extra labour to the Red Cross.    The Board has not hesitated to deal drastically where necessary, as witness a case in which 30,000 men who struck for an advance of about 50 per cent, were actually awarded 100 per cent as being a fair settlement to secure them a living wage.   However these things may be, and without indulging in any extravagant expectations, it is surely not too much to expect that, even taking into account the unrest which has developed here during four years of warfare, a new start might be made, in some such way as is here suggested, which would lead to good results both now and after the war.I venture to observe in conclusion that Labour has been given some grounds for believing that only by strike or threat can prompt and equitable consideration of a claim be secured.established wages at the end of every six months with special reference to any Increase in the cost of living.    If it were generally conceded that standard wages, arranged with or without the intervention of the Board, would be automatically raised by the Board if the cost of living increased further during the war, and that Increase were measured according to the investigations of an independent body of experts, a very great cause of unrest would be removed jX1&apos;
We have only to consider the level of wages even to-day in classes of the community which are not organised, or which have no power to strike.    Hundreds of thousands of poor people have still to be content with wages which they have no power to raise or to gain consideration for, as for example, domestic servants in institutions, nurses, and Civil Servants.   A copy of the &quot;Daily Chronicle&apos;1 of this date lies before me and it shows under the heading &quot;Municipal, Public Institutions&quot;, wages of  1,16,4d per month offered to laundry maids,  1, 16. 4d, per month offered to nurses,  1, 14, 8d. per month offered to kitchen maids,  37 per annum offered to first assistant cooks, 35s, a wegk offered to male lunatic attendants, and so forth,   Jobbing men of middle age can be hired in London for 6s. a day, which is the equivalent cf about 24s, a week before the war.     It is not sufficiently recognised that the United Kingdom was a low wage country, as compared with the countries of the New World, before the war, and that the great rise in the cost of living, combined with contact in this country with armies of well-paid men from the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, has naturally created a new discontent which is by no means without foundation,   A frank declaration by the Government that it recognises the new conditions, and establishes a National War Labour Board with a view to giving practical effect to certain equitable principles, should breed a new confidence in the masses cf labour which, after all, form the great bulk of the nation,(Intd)   L.CM,September 19th. 1918,
