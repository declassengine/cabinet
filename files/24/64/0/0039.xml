Harvest operations are &quot;being pushed forward with all despatch.    Unfortunately a large area was laid and it had to be &quot;fetched&quot; one way, and in some cases across one corner.      The crops, produce and stock disposed of during the week included52 stone rolled oats20 sacks whole oat;:-, 168 pinto milk,81 lbr,. butter 681 eggs.Holboach.    The horses have been busy harvesting when weather permitted,and ploughing up potatoes.    During the week 71 pigo were purchased, and they will bo very useful for stubbling. The unsettled weather has interfered with the harvest operationo, but the most has been mad-? of the fine days and about two-fifthc of tho crops have been carried, all in good order.Heath Hill. There ir- very little to report owing tothe weT*woather during tho week, 1.096 inches of rain having fallen..    A few acres of wheat were carried which completes the carting of that crop, and some five acres of oats, leaving 139 acres to carry.    The ploughing continues steadily for the coming wheat crop.Kelham Bstats.With the exception of a few loads of corn and seme rakings, the harvest operations wore well finished before the break in the weather, and everything was gatnered in good order.In all, there are 48 large stacks of corn:   taking into consideration the poverty and foulness of tho land on which this corn was grown, the result is on the whole satisfactory, although the yield in some oases is doubtful.Ploughing and stubble-clearing has proceeded without delayj and preparations are being mado for sowing the acreage ploughed with wheat, winter oats, and beans.The greater part of the cattle and sheep continue tc do well.    Up t   the present 50 drape cows have boon sold fat off the grass without artificial food, averaging about  37 each, but there are a fev; unsatisfactory cattle which will reduce this average somewhat.Tithe, Copyhold, OommonB and Survey Branch.The applications received during the past week include ten for Redemption and two for Merger of Tithe Rentcharge, one for the redemption of Corn Rents Imposed under a local Act and five for the enfranchisement of copyhold.     Six Altered Apportionments, ten Redemptions of Tithe Rsntcharge, and six Enfranchisements of Copyhold have been confirmed.In view of the increased yield in recent years from money invented in securities, the Board have under consideration the revision of their scale of Compensation for Enfranchisement under the C;pyh*,ld Act, 1394.    The scale is used not only in
enfranchisements under the Act of 1894, hut also in enfranchisements at Common Law,     It is also used in valuations for various purposes other than enfranchisement.    The existing scale was compiled in 1888 &quot;by Mr. A. J. Pinlaison of-the National Debt Office, in consultation with Col. Leach; the Secretary of the Land Commission for England, who then had charge of the administration of the Copyhold Acts,     In the preparation of the Scale Mr, Pinlaison assumed inter alia that the fine interval was 14 years and that the rate of inteFesF^or money was Z?%, It is now under consideration whether the acale should be revised on the basis of a b% rate of interest.     Such a change would involve a drastic alteration in the scale in favour of enfranchising tenants and correspondingly adverse to the interests of lsrds of manors,JPlax Production Branch,With the exception of a very small acreage of late sowings in one or two growing areas of the Branch, the whole of the Flax Crop of 1918 has been harvested.    Part of the crop is being ricked ready for the earlier de-seeding operations,    A large quantity, however, at the request of the Branch, is being erected by tho farmers upon their own premises, 75$ of the amount due to eaoh farmer &quot;being paid to him in cash, after the Branoh has been satisfied that the flax has been properly thatched.The Branch has been concerned with the risk of fire to an inflamable, and, from a war standpoint, an irreplaceable crop. Representations to the War Office, however, failed to obtain the help of that Department in treating the rickyardn as &quot;Vulnerable Points&quot;, The Branch has, therefore, been limited to taking the usual precautions by the provision of Extinguishers, Tire Buckets, etc, and where possible by the appointment of night watchmen.    With regard to the crops ricked upon the farmers1 premises, the precautions advised by the British Fire Preventions Committee have been circulated amongst the growers,- She scarcity of labour, and the shortage of material is causing serious delay in the equipment of the de-seeding stations, and the lack of carpenters deserves special note.     The Office of Works, however, have made urgent representations to the Works Construction Sub-Committee of the War Priority Committee, and to the Labour Priority Committee of the Ministry of National Servioe, strongly supported by the Board, and it is hoped that the immediate difficulties may be sufficiently overcome to enable the seed to be taken off the crop in time for next year&apos;s sowing.Diseases of Animals Branch.Of 219 suspected cases of Swine tfever only 22 were confirmed by the Board, and only 3 cases of Anthrax out of 33 suspected cases were confirmed.    Only 28 outbreaks of Parasitic Mange were reported.The position as to Rabies in Devon a^ears to be rather serious.    There have been 14 suspected cases reported, of which 5 are sufficiently suspicious to   sake inooulation tests at the Board1e Laboratory desirable.     Inquiries still bring to light a number of cases in which dogs were destroyed or died under circumstances that are suspicious.    Very valuable work is being done by theInspectorate Staff.    Requests for permission to move dogs out of the prohibited area have been very numerous owing to the holiday season, and have thrown considerable strain upon the staff.
Pig Production Section,m ntannaii mmmmtomtim m.m.uJtKV***mt*\imj*vMmc w(W1wm*^**wuVisits have been made to the following localities:-We ston-super-Mare, Barnstapie, Bideford, Xlfracombe, Aylepbury, Leighton Buzzard, Linslade, Cheddington, Thame, High Wycombe, Bedford Weliingborough; Desboro&apos;, Kettering, Market Harborough, Leicester, Birmingham, Chester, Rhylp Colwyn Bay, and Huddersfield.Although on tho whole a good deal is being done, pig keeping continues to be hampered by the very unsatisfactory position in respect to feeding stuffs.    Arrangements as to issue of Priority Certificates are often faulty, and feeding stuffs are difficult to obtain even when certificates have been obtained,    The quality of the feeding stuffs available is usually poor and is often   little better than rubbish.    Great difficulty also is encountered in obtaining straw for &quot;bedding.Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of [Food,1?he difficulties of the deeding Stuffs situation still form the central point of discussion at all conferences attended by the Deputy Director.    There also exists a generally expressed desire that straw should be made more available for useu other than agricultural, as it is considered that there will be a considerable surplus of straw after the more essential needs are satisfied.    She immediate effect of this would be to put in the hands of farmers a considerable quantity of manure, the lack of which is at present being keenly felt.The reoent bad harvest weather has provoked an esLjftiry in one distriot as to the possibility of malt kilns being available for assisting in drying farmers&apos; grain.    This suggestion might apply generally when similar conditions prevail,Crdnanoei Survey.iMaps were despatched as follows during the week;-War Office 2,008Air Ministry 7*763 Admiralty 16,966Overseae 158*390Other Services       2291 man for the tfield Survey Companies in Prance and 1 man for Overseas Branchj Ordnance Survey, hare been embarked.Publications Branch,The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 962, in response to which 3,273 copies of leaflets were despatched.    In addition 16,200 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution,    A further supply of 28,000 Leaflets was sent to the Government Information Bureaux for distribution, as explained in previous reports.Applications were received for 626 copies of the three Bound Volumes of Leaflets, and 787 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to Manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.The usual enquiries bearing directly and indirectly on agricultural publications have been received and dealt with by the Branch,
