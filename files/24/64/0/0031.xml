Stf the progress nadc during the week with harvesting operations was slow.   With the exception of late sown oats and spring&apos; wheat practically all the corn has been cut7 but owing tc the heavy showers little stacking could be &amp;one0   Some damage ha3 been caused by heating due to o^erhacto in stacking.   Whore threshing has been done, yields cf grain, particular-ly oats, havo been very satisfactory.

Except in a relatively small number of mills, Scutching operations for the season do not generally start until the beginning of October. In such mills as have commenced Scutching the reports as to how the flax is ?out?hing are very conflicting, and it is impossible yet to submit a reliable report on this point.

With regard to the dissatisfaction among scutchers (which was reported last week) as to the rates of wages fixed by the Arbitration Court, there appears to be no material change in the situation. In a few mills in which work has been commenced the scutchers have stru?. In most cases, however, no start was made, and the situation is that the scutchers are threatening not to begin work until an increased rate of wages is offered them. Their demand is for Â£3. 12.0. per week, time rate; or 2/- per stone, piece work. In several important centres the scutchers have expressed no dissatisfaction and have started work. The trouble appears to be most accute in Co. Antrim and portion of Co. Derry. As few of the mills in these districts commence scutching until the end of September or early in October it is yet impossible to determine whether the scutchers will actually carry into execution their threats not to start work unless their demands are granted. Several reliable informants among the millowners have advised officers of the Department that the lost course for the Government to pursue is to take no notice of the matter as they consider that if no action is taken, the scutchers will in a short time alter their attitude, and commence work. The Department are, of course, keeping in close touch with, the situation, in order to decide whether further Government intervention will be necessary. Millowners&apos; Charges for Scutching. It has been proposed that these charges should be fixed by the Board of Trade under Defence of the Realm Regulation J.J. and the Department are making arrangements for setting up at once a Court of Inquiry to advise as to the charge which should be fixed.

The number of cases of breaches of the Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, reported to date is 229.
