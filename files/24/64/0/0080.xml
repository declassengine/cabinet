I PIS;,. gOgyp^.T. Iff IMS PROPERTY Off HIS BPJTAMIC, MAJftSTY&apos; S GO VERMONT...)b XC R E T6 .7,.-5777.WAR   C A B I O T,, STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONDITIONS IN RUSSIAAND POSITION Off ; BRITISH&apos; J3UB JECTS, (Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 8),Details of a week of terror in Petrograd and Moscow, which began with the murder of Uritsky, Bolshevik Commissary at petrograd for Combating Counter-Revolution, on the 30th August,  are now arriving in this country.The murder was at once proclaimed by the Bolshevik press, (which is the only organ of opinion in Russia at the present time), as the work of English or French agents, though in fact it. was the work, of a Russian student whose name is known, and who, of course, bed no direct or indirect connection what&quot; ever with the Allies,   In order, however, to give colour to their fictitious charge, the political motive of which is apparent, the Bolsheviks at once proceeded to seize Allied representatives and arrested the British Consul General, llr, Woodhouse and. Engineer Commander Le page of the British Navy, in the streets -of petrograd at 1 o&apos;clock on the morning of the 31st,On the aft em con of the same day, Red Guards under the direction of several commissaries made their way into the British Embassy where they behaved with great brutality, and in defiance of all accepted principles of International Law. Captain Cromie, the Naval Attache, tried to bar their way; he was slirfc by the lawless soldiers and died almost instantaneously *   The whole staff of the British Consulate, and the British Missions, as well as some civilians who chanced to be in the Embassy, wore then arrested and marched under escort to the Headquarters Cf the Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution. There they remained Under arrest&apos;until the 3rd September, when they were conveyed to tho portress of peter and Paul,
id oMeanwhile after untiring -exertions in the cause ofhumanitthe Representatives of the Neutral Pewers at Petrograd succeeded in netting possession cf the body of Captain Cromie, which was removed to the English Church on the 2nd September.   The funeral took place in the presence of the whole Diplomatic Corps, and of the greater part of the British and French communities,   The cofi was draoed with the Union jack and completely wreathed in flower After it had been lowered into the grave, the Dutch Minister pronounced the following short address in French and in English&quot;In the name of the British Government and in the name of the family of Captain Cromie .1 thank you all, especially the Representatives of the Allied and neutral countries, for the honour you have shown to Captain Cromie.Friends, we have all known Captain Cromie as a real friendj as a British gentleman, as a British officer in the highest sense of the word &quot;Happy is the country that produces sons like Captain Cromie, .Let his splendid and beautiful example lead us and inspire us all until the end of our days. Amen.&quot;-   The &quot;doyen&quot; rf the Diplomatic Corps-, II. Odier, the Swiss Minister, likewise gave expression to his deep sympathy and admiration for the&apos;gallant officer who had died for his country.The treatment of the British subjects who were confined in the Fortress of Peter and Paul was horrible.   They were crowded together with other prisoners, some 20 in a cell. . Each cell was 20 x 10.feet in dimension, and contained only one bed; the remainder of the prisoners had to sleep on a stone floor. No food whatever was supplied by the Authorities of the&apos;prison, and the prisoners depended for their existence almost entirely on arrangements made for them by the Representatives of the Neutral powers and on food furnished by friends and relations.   JB Rugs, pillows, medicines, warn elsthing and other comforts were sent to them from time to time; but these gifts reached them
either not at all or only with the greatest difficulty.Their sufferings may best be described in their own words as contained in the collective letter which they contrived to send to the outside world&quot;We are not allowed to write a letter.&apos;. We will write daily,since the chances of our letters getting through are very remote.. . . xOur life here is even&apos;worse&apos;than in Gorokhovaya 2,    and in a sense we are being treated exactly like Russian officers and bourgeois who are being slowly starved to death here.   Our only hope lies in parcels&quot;, but delivery of parcels has been stopped for&apos;the moment.   Those due on Monday last have not yet been delivered.   It all depends&apos; on&quot; the caprice of some one in authority and he seems very capricious.   Surely we are entitled to be treated like  -prisoners of war and to be inspected by neutrals, to have the right of buying food, of getting news-, of sending letters, of exercise, of getting clean linen etc..   Apart from the question of food, that Of clothing and medical attention are most important.   All the prisoners here have a chronio diarrhoea;&quot; most of us have now got it.   Requests for a doctor, or medicine, complaints to the Commandant, all receive ho attention.&apos; In short our treatment is absolutely inhuman.Following is a short account of our treatment since Saturday last,   we were never told why we were arrested.   We reached Gorokhovaya 2 at 6..p,m, on Saturday and after questioning of an aimless sort we were put at 8 p.m, in a room about 25 feet by 15 feet where there were already about fifty arrested Russians. All beds were already occupied and we spent the night between the three odd chairs, the floor,, and walking about,. By morning we were all in the first stages of verminosity, very dirty, tired; and hungry./ &quot;x   The headquarters of the Cornedssion for Combating   Counter-Re volution.
inW-The first food oame at 1 pjn. snail howls of had fish, coup and one-eighth of a pound of &quot;bread,   At 6 p.m, we got anotH one-eighth pound of bread.   We received the oiame food on Mo also.     On Sunday night the   room was less full and we got some sleep.   By that time we were also getting used to the journey, (sic).,    parcels arrived on Monday and eased the food situation.-   On Tuesday at 4 p.m, we were marohed through the streets under escort here.   The Consul&apos;e request! for a vehicle for our kit was most rudely refused.   Here we were distributed in different cells, size about 20 feet by 10 feet: in our cell are 13 Russians, four of whom are si owl; starving to death.   They have had no food for three days. After we had been here &apos; thirty*&apos;three hours soup came in at 3 a.m. and one-eighth pound of bread.   We could not eat the soup: wood, leather, stones, mixed with cabbage and pamper Y/ere its main ingredients.   So we too will sooner or later starve to death.   Our immediate need is parcels, but it is essential to send some one here on Saturday to see if they have been delivered and to obtain our receipts,.     Otherwise they will not be delivered,Next is medical comforts (l) for diarrhoea ( ) aspirin, We oan get none.   Third is some money.We will write again tomorrow.   We are not allov/ed to leave our cells.   The door is never opened.   The W.C, periodically refuses to work, and the atmosphere Is appallini(Signed) Prom British subjects detained in Petor and PaOutside the Fortress terrorism was rampant.   Thousands of Russians, not only officers and members of the wealthy classes, but also merchants and shop-keepers, were being arrested daily on charges of counter-revolution and in repri for the murder of Uritsky.    According to the Bolsheviks owl statement 500 were shot during this one week.Fewer
Foreign Office,25th September, 1918rPewer details are known of events in Moscow but in general they were similar to those at Petrograd.   It was the policy of the Bolshevik Government to attempt to justify the murder of Captain Cromie by alleging that the British diplomatic representatives were involved in plots against the Government, Therefore on the night after his murder Mr. Lockhart&apos;s house at Moscow was searched and he himself was arrested..   After detention for several hours, during which his apartment was sacked and after failure to find any incriminating documents, Mr. Lockhart was roll eased, only to be again arrested on the 4th September.   The Bolshevik press was all,the time exciting public opinion against the Allies and. all persons, whether Allied or Russian were in continuous peril for their lives *
