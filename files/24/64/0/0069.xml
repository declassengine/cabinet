.1   j-.1. ^S 35 C K E TsDo spat cliod 8 o. ditto Received 6 a22/9/18o 23/9/18eFromGeneral KnoxoTo&quot;&apos;D,I.uIe, War Office.Repeated LUAo Tokyo.74 o    September. 22nd0Your cable 66725 dated 19th instant.    Fear the importance of Japanese opinion is exaggerated,,   The Japanese have declared it Is their intention for the present not to proceed beyond Baikal,   The main work of a mission to reorganize the Russian army will be beyond Baikal and this work should commence at once.a    Even supper,-ing General Otani wore to invite me to undertake it. it is not cloar what right he would have to give such an invitation or how the fact of his giving it would allay the jealousy of the French.    In my cable rlumber 3 to CcI*.G.,S9 I have tried to explain how weak and dis-honest a piece of pleading is the French reply.   However from your cable I take It that H * M 0 Governmont is about to yield, though, this Implies a surrender of British prestige.    Twice the Japanese have been told officially that I was to undertake the organization and all Russians have naturally looked to me In consequence,.   Presumably you will wish me to tell the Japanese and Russians that the French and not the British mission is to undertake the reorganization? Now from Russian point of view *The French idea of undertaking the re-organization being ovid-nv-ly an afterthought, they have nothing ready and before General Janin&apos; arrives the situation will have been lostc     I have tried to impress On you in my cables (1 group undecipherable) that Russian public opinion Is worried by the attitude of the Japanese and the Americans * Definite action is required to show that allied intervention is not ?tn excuse for international robbery, but is meant to help Russia In something more substantial than phrases.   To-day the 0.0* troops came to me to voice the opinion of all Russia that if we do not act at once it will be too late.   If II.H.Government is surrendering the whole project to the French, in Russia1s interests wo have a right to ask when the Frenchmen propose to commence work.
S E C R H! TProm: D.H.I., !7ar Office.To   : General Khox.   Repeated MJi. Tokio.Despatched 10 p.mf 19*9.18* 66725 cipher 11,1,Reference your 49 of September 17th and earlier telegrams regarding project for reorganization of the Russian Array.   The matter was laid before French Government for their concurrence on receipt of intimation that Japanese General Staff had agreed to your undertaking this task.   French note received September 12th is to the effect that, with regard to Russia/ France is in a special position, that she has three Russian divisions at her disposal in France and Macedonia whose officers are qualified to serve as cadres in Siberia, and Russian forces in Siberia should therefore be organised in liaison with bhe Czechs *   The tone cf the French note is such as to leave little hope for a change of attitude9 and it may be best for us to fall in with French proposal for reasons advanced in your NOc 39 of September 14th.   This course has not yet however been decided en by us, and I asked Japanese M.A. on the 16th to telegraph Military Authorities Tokio asking that General Otani should apply for the services of your Mission for the purpose in question.Referring to your telegram of Sept o 16 th No a 45, His   Majestylr Government appreciate to fullest extent the critical situation of the Czechs and you have full authority to -offer all British resources at your disposal to be used immediately for&apos; their relief o   17e realise that Japanese and Americans only can give substantial assistance, but I believe those Governments will only be guided by reports of their agents on the spot.   They are without doubt however fully informed, and we cannot supply them with any facts of which they are not already cognisant *   The course which is most likely to prove successful is for General Gaida to insistently impress,upon those who alone are in a position to relievo it the laments c&apos;-case of his countrymen.
