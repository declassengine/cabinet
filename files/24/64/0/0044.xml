J^m^^n^ jog [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1918.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 69. Week ended 14th September, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS. Minelaying lias been carried out in the North Sea and in the Heligoland Bight.        North. Sea.There has been very little aerial activity during the week owing to bad weather Flanders conditions.  R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, working with the Navy, have, however, Area, carried out several raids on the Belgian coast, including Bruges Docks and Ghistelles and Stalhille aerodromes, about three tons of bombs in all being dropped.   All our machines returned safely.On 6th September the French destroyer &quot; Pierrier &quot; bombarded the East Jetty, Beirut, Mediter-without reply from the enemy.   The same destroyer, in company with the French ranean. destroyer &quot; Coutelas,&quot; again bombarded this jetty on 10th September, and, it is reported, sank a schooner in the port.   The only resistance offered by the enemy was by one aeroplane, which was driven ofi.  The destroyers then fired on the submarine base at Tripoli (Syria), but with what result is not known.On 11th September a force of 14 aircraft from Taranto and Otranto carried out a raid on San Giovanni de Medua. Nearly l  tons of explosive bombs and also 30 incendiary bombs were dropped with good effect, hits being observed on the quay, a railway siding and an enemy transport column, and several fires were started. All our machines returned safely.The destroyer &quot; Nessus &quot; sank on 8th September as the result of collision with the Casualties, minelayer &quot; Amphitrite.&quot;  There were no casualties.On 12th September the armed boarding steamer &quot; Sarnia &quot; was sunk by torpedo when 24 miles from Alexandria ; 64 of the crew are missing.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.The number of large enemy submarines, of a type which operates further afield than Submarines the North Sea, which were located during the week, increased to 24, including six of the operating. &quot; Cruiser&quot; type.  Of these latter two were in Home Waters and homeward bound, two apparently on passage to the American coast, and one had just arrived there, while the other vessel of the &quot; Cruiser &quot; type was working in the vicinity of the Azores.The remaining large submarines were mainly operating to the north and south of Ireland, and to the westward of the Bay of Biscay. Two boats were continuously off the east coast of England during the week, but met with little success, while the English Channel was free of enemy submarines until the end of the week, when one appeared in Lyme Bay.(c 1403)  wt. - 50  9/18  fl &amp; s a
Although the number of submarines operating was somewhat larger than usual, unfavourable weather during the middle of the week was responsible for a general diminution in enemy activities.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all Waters during recent weeks submarines. an(j     n8^mq 0f the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed or lost to the enemy as the result of such actions: Number and ton-nage of all vessels sunk.Nature of Craft, &amp;c.

The number,of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy Vessels which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyed. Convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : Convoy.	Weekly average, July, 1918.		Weekly average, August, 1918.		Week ended 7th Sept., 1918.

Of the convoyed sailings 0-2 per cent, were lost in Convoy and 0-4 per cent, before joining or after dispersal, while 5*7 per cent, of the non-convoyed vessels sailing were sunk.The number of British and Foreign steamships of 500 tons and upwards which were Number of attacked in the different areas in the months of June, &quot;July and August are shown in the submarine following table :  attacks inrecent- monthsNumber of Ships attacked. compared.Area.

The total figure for August shows some increase, which was, however, not in British shipping or in European waters, being practically wholly accounted for by an increase in the number of attacks off the American coast.As regards Home Waters it will be seen that the position on the East Coast is steadily improving, but that this is counter-balanced by increased activity on the West Coast. The attacks in the English Channel are maintained at practically a constant level.Number ofvesselssunk bysubmarinein recentmonthscompared.The number of British and Foreign steamships of 500 tons and upwards which were sunk in the different areas in the months of June, July and August are shown in the following table: Number of Ships Sunk.Area.

No enemy ships have entered or left men&apos; Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. France.Rear-Admiral Mercier de Lostende, who is being succeeded as Naval Attache to the French Embassy in London by Rear-Admiral Grasset, will take up command of the Coast Defences at Toulon.Spain.There are no serious developments of the so-called submarine crisis. The German Government are reported to have offered to give Spain six or seven vessels in place of those sunk outside the prohibited zone, but the proposal has not yet been accepted. Meanwhile another Spanish steamship, the &quot;San Sebastian,&quot; is reported to have been torpedoed off Sardinia, and still another attacked off the Canary Islands, but no details of either of these cases are yet to hand. Even if Spain were to seize an interned German steamship it is not likely that Germany would proceed to war or even to rupture of nego-tiations. The numerous strikes which are taking place throughout Spain may be fostered by Germany with the object of diverting the attention of the Spanish Government.Russia.The Russian Government of Northern Russia has apparently decided to resign as a result of the military coup oVetat and they desire to appoint in their place a Governor-General who will be directly responsible to the Central Authority at Samara. The latter Authority is at present controlled by General Alexeieff and Messrs. Stepanon and Avksen-tieff, who make use of the existing Zemstvo and municipal organizations for administration. They will therefore also be able to control the situation in Northern Russia in the interests of the Allies, but, on the other hand, the change is expected to have a depressing effect on successful mobilisation, in view of the fact that the population of the Northern Provinces is mainly Social Revolutionary and hold the same views as most of the members of the late Government.There has been considerable feeling at Archangel over the conscription order intro-duced by the late Government, and H.M. Representative is making it quite clear that H.M. Government is in no way responsible for the introduction of this order.
An Allied Committee has been formed to administer the distribution of food to the civilian population of Archangel.The Allies have now requested the officer commanding Russian troops in the Maritime Province of Siberia to proclaim martial law at Vladivostok and throughout the province. Japanese marines occupied Nikolaevsk-on-Amur on 9th September, and Semenoff and Japanese cavalry entered Chita on 6th inst. and were well received.Baku still holds out, and it is reported that Bicharakoff has now arrived to reinforce the British troops there. The local authorities have placed 10 steamers at the disposal of General Dunsterville, who will arm them and provide British guns&apos; crews, but otherwise the captains and crews will be Russian.Naval Staff.19th September, 1918.[Appendix-
