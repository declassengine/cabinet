September 24th, 11,a.in.Since yesterday morning the strike, mainly of loco-motive men, which was confined to the Great Western Railway in South Wales has spread considerably.      Hereford, Shrewsbury and Worcester were affected during the course of the day and last night the strike spread to Bristol, Old Oak Common (the most important Great Western locomotive depot in London), Birmingham, Oxford and Plymouth.       At Plymouth the workmen&apos;s trails to the dockyards have been, unable to run but there is a good tramway service by which the men can reach work.      At    Bristol   the signalmen have gone out with the result that all traffic at that place is practically stopped.      The London &amp; North Western Railway are also affected, the locomotive men at Shrewsbury left work yesterday afternoon and last night Willesden locomotive men and the locomotive men at Bow left work.        This will seriously affect the distribu-tion of coal in London   and stop all steam traffic on the Horth London Railway.The only other line affected is the Midland Railway at Worcester, where the locomotive men left work yesterday. The effect of the position on the Great Western is naturally very serious.        The output of coal will, for the time being, cease, and Admiralty coal carried by rail to port3 0&quot; the South, East and ITorth-East coasts is completely stopped. Coal for shipment -is still passing on the Taff, Khymn/:y,and Barry Railways, but this is a small part of the whole. The transport of munitions is also affected.      There are eight munition trains each day transferred from the Great Western to the London &amp; South &quot;western Railway for haulage to Southampton and four each day transferred to the London Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway for haulage to ITewhaven.     These trains, so far as the Great Western are concerned cannot be run, though it may be possible to divert some of them by other routes. The Railway Company succeeded last night in. getting meat trains through to London and distributing the meat to the markets and this morning the milk trains have been successfully worked through, but in South Wales the food situation will probably become serious in a very short time as the towns in the various valleys draw large supplies daily from the big centres such as Swansea, Newport and Cardiff and these places will be cut off.      This matter is however being looked into by the Road Transport Board in consultation with the Ministry of Pood and Railway Executive Committee.So far there has been no disorder but picketing is being carried out at some centres, though in an orderly manner.)
