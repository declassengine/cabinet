REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON LABOUR EMBARGOESTo the Right Honourable WINSTON S. CHURCHILL, M.P. Minister of Munitions.Sir,i. We desire to submit the following Interim Report..2. The terms of reference are as follows: (i) To investigate and report on the labour conditions which have rendered the embargo neces-sary, and to advise upon the administration of the scheme; (2) To consider and report as to what further measures should be adopted in view of these con-ditions, to maintain and where necessary increase the output of munitions, due regard beinggiven to the public interest, in the most effective and economical use of labour, money andmaterial..3. Upon considering the terms of reference, it became apparent that they suggested a wide field of enquiry, and raised many questions of an important and general character. The labour condi-tions created by the war, and the legislation and changes consequent thereon, have led to a series of interconnected and difficult problems. To deal with the whole of such problems would clearly exceed the limits of the reference, but the Committee have deemed it desirable to extend their enquiries beyond the questions directly raised by the embargo scheme itself.4. The appointment of the Committee was due to the recent stoppage of work at Coventry. We have, therefore, thought it well to present an Interim Report dealing, not only with the embargo scheme, but also with the Coventry stoppage, and with the circumstances which led to it. Many of those circumstances are not confined to Coventry, but are of a more general character. We have, therefore, taken evidence, so far as necessary for the purposes of this Report, not from Coventry alone, but also from Birmingham, and from representative national organisations of workmen and of employers, as well as from many officials of the Government Departments con-cerned. *5. The Committee commenced its sittings within three days of their appointment. They have already held twenty-one prolonged meetings. Seventy-one witnesses have attended before us and have given evidence of an important and in many cases of an intricate character.f6. The stoppage of work took place at Coventry on the 23rd July, 1918. As a result, the production of vital and urgent munitions of war was suspended. The stoppage spread to Birmingham, and showed signs of extending to other areas.  Work was resumed on the 30th of July.,7. The Ministry of Munitions had, on the 1st July, 1918, issued &quot;embargo letters&quot; to three firms in Coventry with respect to the engagement of skilled men. In substance, those letters prevented the firms from engaging any skilled men without a licence from the Ministry of Munitions. Each of the three firms was engaged in the manufacture of important munitions of war.:8. It is perhaps unfortunate that the word &quot; embargo &quot; has been employed in connection with the issue of such letters. The use of the word &quot; embargo&quot; may tend to suggest a general and absolute prohibition, and may convey to many an erroneous impression of the actual policy of the Gov-ernment; but the word is now in common use, and the Committee, therefore, employ it for the purposes of this Report.*q. In order that the matters referred to at a later stage of this Report may be clear, the Committee deem it advisable to set out in full the embargo letter sent to each of the three firms. It is as follows:&quot; Gentlemen,&quot; I am directed by the Minister of Munitions to enclose herewith for your information a copy of Regulation 8a of the Defence cf the Realm Regulations, 1914, under which you will perceive that the Minister has power, among other things, to regulate or restrict the carrying out of any work in any factory, workshop or other premises, or the engagement or employ-ment of any workman or workmen, or all or any classes of workmen therein with a view to &apos; maintaining or increasing the production of munitions in other factories, workshops or pre-mises. You will readily appreciate that the imperative call for more men to meet the needs of the Army, taken in conjunction with the serious shortage of labour that already exists, renders it vital that the utmost possible use should be made, in the national interest, of all -available labour in the country.&quot;I am to state that the Minister, in the exercise of the power vested in him, and with a
view to increasing the production of munitions in other factories, workshops or premises, where skilled labour is urgently required, has decided to issue, and hereby issues, the follow-ing directions, regulations and restrictions in respect of your establishment, viz.: &quot;(i) On and after the receipt hereof, you shall not engage for employment in your Estab-ment, without the licence of the Minister any skilled man of any of the types set out in the schedule at the back hereof.&quot;(2) If you desire to obtain a licence for the engagement or employment of any skilled man or men, of any of the types specified in the schedule, you should apply in writing to^ the Chief Dilution Officer for such licence, and should give full particulars of the work for which the man or men is or are needed, and such other information as the Ministry may require.&quot;(3) The expression &apos;skilled man&apos; in Clauses (1) and (2) includes any skilled man of any of the types specified in the schedule at the back hereof, who receives the full district rate for the work on which he is employed.&quot; (4) You are hereby required to comply with any directions given by any representative of the Ministry of Munitions with a view to the carrying out of this order, and in par-ticular to produce to him your register of labour and/or form 82 S, or any modification, thereof, and to complete the same forthwith in case any of them is incomplete, and to give him all such information ashe may require and in such form as he may require, as to the persons in your employment and to make such returns and keep such records. from time to time as he may require as to such persons.&quot; (5) Nothing herein stated shall affect the existing powers of the Minister to assign or trans-fer any man or men.&quot;(6) Clause (1) of this Order shall not apply to the re-engagement of existing employees, where there has been no break in the employment, nor to the engagement of dis--charged sailors and soldiers.&quot; I am to state that, in connection with this matter, a representative of the Ministry will visit your Establishment very shortly, and I am to ask that you will have your register of labour ready for his inspection, and that you will afford him all other facilities for ascertaining the number of skilled men of the types mentioned in the Schedule who are employed by you, and the use that is being made by you of their services.&quot; I am, Gentlemen,&quot;Your obedient Servant,The Schedule at the back of each letter contained the words &quot;skilled labour of all types.&quot;The above letters were issued in pursuance of the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Regulations. Clause 8A of those Regulations, so far as is material, is as follows:  &quot;It shall be lawful for the Admiralty, Army Council or Air Council or the Minister of &quot;Munitions-&quot;(a) to require any work in any factory or workshop to be done in accordance with the directions of the Admiralty, Army Council or Air Council or the-&quot; Minister of Munitions, given with the object of making the factory or work-&quot;shop or the plant or labour therein as useful as possible for the production &quot;of war material, and to require returns as to the nature and amount of work &quot;done in any factory or workshop;&quot;(b) to regulate or restrict the carrying on of any work in any factory, workshop &quot;or other premises, or the engagement or employment of any workman, or all &quot;or any classes of workmen, therein, or to remove the plant therefrom, with a &quot;view to maintaining or increasing the production of munitions in other factories, &quot;workshops or premises, or to regulate and control the supply of metals and &quot;material that may be required for any articles for use in war;  and the-&quot;occupier and every officer and servant of the occupier of the factory, workshop &quot;or premises, and any other person affected by any such directions, regulations &quot;or restrictions, and where the occupier is a company, every director of the-&quot;company, shall obey the directions, regulations or restrictions of the Admiralty, &quot;Army Council or Air Council or the Minister of Munitions so given, and if he-&quot;fails to do so he&apos; shall be guilty of an offence against these regulations.&quot;This Regulation has been in existence since the year 1915, and has appeared in conjunction with the general body of the Defence of the Realm Regulations which have been published from time to time. It is based upon the powers given by the Defence of the Realm Acts, and is in consonance with Section 10 of the Munitions of War Act, 191*5. The existence of these-powers has, therefore, been publicly known for three years. The embargo procedure was not, however, exercised as a definite scheme until the present year.For the purpose of appreciating the conditions which led to the adoption of the embargo scheme, it has been necessary to consider the supply of skilled labour as affected by the-war.   In the autumn of 1914, large numbers of men from the engineering and allied trades-
hastened to enlist in the Navy and Army. In 1915 a huge and ever-increasing output of munitions of war was demanded. The Military Service Acts, as they were passed, drew from their callings further skilled workmen, whilst the need for production of munitions on a greater scale became more urgent month by month. The imperative requirements of the Army for man-power competed with the requirements of the Minister of Munitions, and the demands of the Admiralty for productive purposes were equally imperative. The position created by the German offensive in March last led to further unavoidable calls by the Army Council.The Committee do not dwell on these matters of common knowledge! The unparalleled call on the resources of this country is a dominant factor in the questions now under con-sideration. The labour problems of to-day arise to a great extent from the unprecedented conditions created by the war and from the necessity of simultaneously securing the man-power essential for the Forces whilst providing, at the same time, the necessary equipment and munitions for this country and its Allies.14. In order to form a clear view as to the extent of the labour shortage, the Committee have taken a considerable body of expert evidence. The general figures which have been con-sidered may be stated as follows: In March, 1918, the unsatisfied labour demands for munitions work had reached 83,000; in June, 1918, this figure had risen to over 97,000, and on July 19th it had further, risen to over 100,000. The above numbers include both skilled and unskilled labour. The Committee have examined the statistics laid before them, and have given due weight to the relevant considerations in order to arrive at a conclusion As the, broad result, there can be no doubt that at the present time there is a most serious shortage of skilled workers throughout the country. We may add, that although differences of opinion upon various points have appeared in the testimony given before us, no witness has expressed a doubt as to the striking extent of the existing shortage.15. The problem which faced the Government through the shortage of labour had been accen-tuated by various circumstances. As the war progressed, new methods of attack and defence were developed, and new instruments of warfare were evolved. The manufacture of aero-engines on a vast scale became imperative, guns in greater number were needed, and the provision of a large number of tanks became essential. Month by month fresh demands have arisen calling for active and novel manufacturing effort. Not only has there been an incredible growth in the demand for munitions, both for this country and our Allies, but the changes from time to time in the nature or urgency of the munitions required have been of a most striking character. There is, moreover, an equally striking variation in the quan-tities and types of the munitions which the continually altering conditions of war necessitate. At the present time, certain special munitions call for immediate production upon the largest possible scale.The Committee desire to record the fact that the Government has laid before them evidence of a weighty, though necessarily confidential nature, with respect to their munitions programme,16. From time to time efforts have been made to meet the difficulties caused by the scarcity of skilled labour. The War Munitions Volunteer scheme (subsequently regulated by Section 6 of the Munitions of War Actj 1915) was initiated. A large number of men have been enrolled thereunder up to the present time. They loyally placed their services at the disposal of the Minister of Munitions for transfer to such work of national importance in controlled firms as the Minister might direct. The scheme, although of considerable value, has not solved the difficulty.17. A further effort to grapple with the problem was made in the autumn of 1916, when the Army-Reserve Munition Workers&apos; scheme was launched. A number of workmen enrolled, and the scheme has proved of service to the State, but the result, again, has been an alleviation only, and not a solution of the difficulty.18. A further effort to reduce the shortage was made by the return to civil life of a number of skilled men, who, prior to their military service, had been engaged in various branches of the engineer-ing and allied trades. Large numbers have been released from the Army for work of national importance. The possibility of further releases is one which must obviously.be determined by the Army Council and the War Cabinet. It involves matters of policy and military necessity which are beyond the scope of this Committee. It is obvious, however, as one of the factors in this question, that, as the equipment of the Army becomes increasingly complex on its mechanical side, an ever-increasing body of skilled men must be required by the various artificer corps to maintain and repair the vastly increased number of guns, aeroplanes, tanks, mechanical trans-port, and other appliances of war.19. The principle of dilution had been adopted in March, 1915, with the patriotic assent of a large number of Trade Unions of skilled workmen. This scheme has also proved of the greatest value to the nation. The training of munition workers, which is involved in the dilution scheme, has also been of marked utility. The scheme, it should be added, was accepted by the skilled workmen under the conditions indicated in the Treasury Agreements of March 19th, 1915, and March 25th, 1915. The Committee desire to state their view that it is essential that the work-men who assented to these Agreements should be satisfied that the conditions of their acceptance will be fulfilled.
Dilution has become more difficult as it has extended to the more highly skilled operations. During the last 12 months there has been a great change, as already indicated, in the nature of the more important types of munitions. Thus, while further dilution has become more difficult, and recently.the fund of skilled labour has rapidly grown smaller, there has been an enormous demand for the output of complex munitions which do not permit of the use of semi-skilled or unskilled labour to a degree in any way approaching its possible use for the munitions&apos; output of two years ago.. The circumstances already recited will suffice to indicate the urgent need of economy in the use of skilled labour, and the necessity of utilising skilled men in the most effective and productive manner.. In the early part of the present year, the Ministry of Munitions formed the view, that additional steps were required, in the national interests, in order to assist in securing the necessary distri-bution of skilled labour. It had become apparent that, in the absence of some restriction on the freedom of certain establishments to engage skilled labour, workmen might move from firms by whom their services were urgently required for munitions work of a vital and urgent nature, to firms where the need for skilled labour was less urgent. The general conditions of labour in some establishments may be more satisfactory than in others. The wages, moreover, for various reasons may yield a higher average. It is natural that skilled workmen should seek, if possible, to better their conditions. The human element is as potent with them as with other members of the community, but a movement of skilled labour which renders it more difficult, or perhaps im-possible, to produce in adequate quantities a vital munition of immediate urgency, is clearly opposed to the safety of the country and to the general interests of all.3. Hence the Government came to the conclusion that the public interests required some restriction on the powers of individual employers to engage skilled labour without regard to the require-ments of other firms engaged on munitions work which, in some cases, might be of a more urgent character. The issue of embargo letters to certain firms represents the steps taken in pursuance of this conclusion, and constitutes what is called the &quot;Embargo scheme.&quot;4. We fully recognise that these restrictions on the employers necessarily diminish the freedom of skilled labour by preventing the acceptance of employment at embargoed firms until a licence is given to the employer by the Ministry of Munitions. The results, however, are not confined to workmen, for the embargo may occasion difficulty or dislocation to employers also, inasmuch as it may be easier for an employer to accept and fulfil a munitions contract if he possesses liberty to engage additional skilled labour. An adequate supply of skilled men renders the task of organ-isation and supervision much less burdensome.The action taken by the Government was not due to any desire on their part to affect the position of skilled men, but sprang from the necessity of precluding employers from engaging skilled men to the detriment of the general national needs. The limitation on the right of skilled labour to dispose of its services in the best market was the unavoidable result, and not the object of the Governments action.5. The Committee are satisfied, after careful enquiry, that the Government were justified in their conclusion as to the necessity for the Embargo scheme. Before deciding to put it into force, the relevant facts and circumstances were considered, the questions arising with respect to the interests of workmen and employers were weighed, and attention was given to the question as to whether any practicable alternative existed which could achieve the desired object. The Ministry of Munitions, we think, fulfilled their duty in taking the step which they deemed essential for providing to the utmost possible extent the munitions required for the effective conduct of the war. It is worthy of note that none of the witnesses before us challenged the need for a scheme for securing the most efficient distribution of skilled labour. Representative witnesses, both of workmen and employers, frankly admitted the necessity for some such scheme. Their criticism went to the method of administration, and not to the necessity of the scheme.6. It is not without interest to observe that in April last the Ministry of Munitions put into operation in the London Sheet Metal Trade a scheme for regulating wages and restricting engagement of labour which contained the same characteristics in regard to embargoes and licences as exist in the scheme before the Committee. This action in the London District fol-lowed upon an agreement which had been made between the workmen&apos;s and employers&apos; representatives in February of this year.7. The Committee point out that the powers conferred by&quot; Regulation 8a can be exercised with respect to all establishments, whether engaged on munitions work or not; the number of controlled firms in this country exceeds 6,000; the number of firms officially listed as engaged on munitions work exceeds 32,000, whilst the total number of firms throughout the country to which the embargo has been applied up to the present time is less than 100. These embargoes have taken place from time to time in the period from February to July of the present year. A considerable number of licences to employers to engage additional labour have been granted by the Ministry. The aim of the Ministry has been to limit the applica-tion of the embargo to firms with respect ,to whom it was felt that skilled labour was being or might be engaged to the detriment of other munitions work or to firms where skilled labour was not being utilised in the most efficient and economical manner.
28. The facts in connection with the stoppage of work at Coventry are as follows: An embargo letter had been issued on the 2nd February, 1918, by the Ministry of Munitions to the Daimler Company, Ltd., of Coventry. The Daimler embargo seems not to have been a matter of general knowledge amongst the workmen in Coventry, and it is clear that no appreciable trouble arose therefrom..29. On the 1st July, 1918, letters of embargo were sent to three other firms, namely, Messrs. Hotchkiss, the Siddeley-Deasy Motor Co., Ltd., and the Triumph Cycle Co., Ltd.30. Upon receipt of the embargo letter on July 2nd, 1918, Messrs. Hotchkiss issued a notice to their foremen in the following terms:  &quot;NOTICE  TO  FOREMEN.&quot;In&quot;accordance with instructions received from the Ministry of Munitions, we are &quot;prohibited, until further notice, from engaging skilled men of any type.&quot; By the term &apos; skilled man&apos; is understood any man in receipt of at least the standard &quot; district rate.&quot;You are requested to note that any infringement of this rule renders us liable to &quot;heavy penalties under the Defence of the Realm Act, Section 8A; and every effort, &quot;therefore, must in future be exerted whenever it is necessary to employ men, to make &quot;use only of semi or unskilled men.&quot;Nothing in the foregoing prohibits us from employing a skilled discharged sailor &quot;or soldier.&quot;(Signed)   S. B. Works Superintendent.&quot;The notice was issued in the ordinary course of factory management by the Wotrks Superintendent. It was issued, therefore, for a limited object only, and was not intended for any other purpose than to guide the foremen.31. It will be observed (a) that the notice sets out a definition of the term &quot;skilled man&quot; which is not identical with the words employed in the embargo letter, and which might well give an impression different to that conveyed by the embargo letter itself, and (b) that it does not refer to the fact that licences for the employment of skilled labour may be granted to the firm by the Ministry. The foremen, however, would not be concerned with any steps which might be necessary for the purpose of obtaining a licence.We have taken the evidence of two responsible representatives of the firm, and we desire to say that, in our opinion, Messrs. Hotchkiss acted with perfect good faith in issuing the notice, although, in view of subsequent events, it would have been better if they had explained more fully to the foremen the whole effect of the embargo letter.32. The following corespondence has passed between the Ministry of Munitions and Messrs. Hotch-kiss.MESSRS. HOTCHKISS TO THE MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS. &quot;To :-&quot;The Secretary, Ministry of Munitions, 23rd July, 1918.Dept. D.P. 5737, Whitehall Gardens, SW. -&quot;Dear Sir,.&quot; Certain mis-statements having appeared in the daily Press as to the labour situation at &quot; Coventry, we take this opportunity to correct them. On the 2nd instant a letter from the &quot; Ministry of Munitions was received putting an embargo on the further engagement of skilled &quot; men without a licence. On the 3rd instant the following typewritten instruction was handed &quot; to each department head for his guidance: &quot;NOTICE. TO FOREMEN,&quot; In accordance with instructions received from the Ministry of Munitions, we are pro-&quot; hibited, until further notice, from engaging skilled men of any type.&quot; By the term &apos; skilled man&apos; is understood any man in receipt of at least the standard &quot;district rate.&quot; You are requested to note that any infringement of this rule renders us liable to heavy &quot;penalties under the Defence of the Realm Act, Section Sa, and every effort, therefore, must &quot; in future be exerted, whenever it is necessary to employ men, to make use only of semi- or &quot;unskilled men.&quot; Nothing in the foregoing prohibits us from employing a skilled discharged sailor or &quot; soldier.&quot; (Signed)   S. B. Works Superintendent.&quot;&quot;It w?as essential that the department heads be made quite clear on the following: &quot; (a) We were prohibited from engaging skilled men until further notice i.e., until we obtained&quot;the. licence applied for. &quot; (b) The definition  &apos; skilled man&apos;   as per the official instructions i.e., &quot; The expression&quot;&apos; skilled man&apos; in Clauses. 1 and 2 includes any skilled man of any of the types specified in&quot; the schedule at the back hereof, who receives the full district rate for the work in which&quot; he is employed.&quot;
THE MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS TO MESSRS. HOTCHKISS.&quot;Sir. 25th July, 1918.&quot; I am directed by the Minister of Munitions to refer to your letter of July 23rd, on the &quot; subject of the notice in respect of the embargo scheme alleged to have been posted by your &quot; firm. The Minister observes that vou state that the notice was never intended to be posted, &quot; and was merely a direction to foremen.&quot; I am to state that, while the Minister accepts this statement, he none the less regrets that &quot; any notice was issued in this form, which is incorrect in at least two important particulars. &quot; In the first place, it makes no reference to the fact that it is possible for an embargoed firm &quot; to apply for a licence under which, if a case is shown, additional skilled labour may be taken &quot; on. This omission vitally affects the fair presentation of the whole scheme. In the second &quot; place, the third paragraph incorrectly summarises the embargo letter. The impression &quot; created by this paragraph would be that it is the intention of the Department that in some &quot; way the position of the skilled men should be prejudicially affected by the embargo. On &quot; this, I am to draw your attention to the last sentence in the first paragraph of the embargo &quot; letter, which reads as follows: &quot;You will readily appreciate that the imperative call for more men to meet the needs &quot; of the Army, taken in conjunction with the serious shortage of labour that already exists, &quot; renders it vital that the utmost possible use should be made in the national interest of &quot; all available labour in the country.&quot;&quot; This makes it clear that the object of the embargo, so far from reducing the employment &quot; of skilled men, is to secure that they shall be employed .to the fullest extent on fully-skilled &quot; work. The result of the embargo in no way, therefore, affects either the status or the wages &quot; of the skilled men.&quot; In view of the misunderstandings which have occurred the Minister thinks it essential, in &quot; the public interest, that the notice should be immediately withdrawn, and further that this &quot; corespondence should be published, and he proposes accordingly to take this course.&quot; I am, Sir,&quot; Your obedient Servant, &quot;The Manager, Hotchkiss et Cie, &quot;(Signed)  J. A. BARLOW.&quot; Artillery Works, Coventry.&quot;MESSRS. HOTCHKISS TO THE MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS. &quot; The Secretary,&quot; Ministry of Munitions. 26th July, 1918.&quot; Sir,&quot; We have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th inst, and to inform &quot; you that we have complied with the instruction contained in the last paragraph of same.&quot; We desire to confirm our letter of the 23rd inst., in which we state that the memorandum &quot; to our department heads was a confidential instruction handed to our foremen for their &quot;guidance. Said memo, was not a notice to our workmen, neither was it posted in our works, &quot; nor was it intended as a presentation of your scheme to the department heads to whom it &quot; was handed.&quot;We are, Sir,&quot; Your obedient Servants,&quot;(Signed)  HOTCHKISS ET CIE.&quot; ,33. Although the notice was intended merely as an instruction to the foremen of Messrs. Hotchkiss, its terms speedily became known to the general body of workmen in Coventry. It is clear that its contents, omitting, as they did,- all reference to the provisions as to a licence, and creating an erroneous view as to its effect on the status of skilled men, were one of the exciting causes of the &quot;stoppage.34. The notice came as a surprise to the men, and was regarded by them as meaning that the firm were absolutely prohibited from engaging skilled men. The men were also alarmed at ,the definition of &quot;skilled man &quot; contained in that instruction, as they thought that it incorporated into the ranks of skilled men those who were dilutees in receipt of the district rates of wages, and that it might, therefore, tend to undermine seriously the definition of &quot;skilled man&quot; for the purpose of the Munitions of War Acts and the Treasury Agreements of March. 1915, and thus affect the restora-tion of the position of skilled men upon the cessation of the war. It was not understood that the definition was employed for the sole purpose of indicating to the employer the scope of the em-&quot; We beg to submit that the &apos; Notice to Foremen &apos; is an accurate summary of the &quot; instructions, and we would like to make clear that it was not posted in the works as stated in &quot;the daily Press, but privately handed to each of the department heads. It appears to have &quot;been communicated to outside parties without the managements knowledge.&quot; Yours faithfully,&quot;(Signed) HOTCHKISS ET CIE.&quot;
f&apos; 1 bargo letter. If the letter itself had been seen, it would, moreover, have been apparent &apos; i-  - that the prohibition was subject to the grant of licences.,35. The Committee think it unfortunate that a concise instruction issued by the Works Superintend-ent in the ordinary course of management should have had attached to it by the men the im-portance of a Government document. The misunderstanding, in our opinion, arose from the fact that this instruction was the only information obtained by the men that the embargo was in operation at Messrs. Hotchkiss&apos;, or as to the terms of the embargo letter. The application of the embargo to the firm was not officially known until afterwards,at the Coventry Employment Exchange.36. A further exciting cause of the stoppage arose in connection with the Siddeley-Deasy Co., Ltd. Prior to July, that firm had agreed to engage  a number of skilled workers.   These men, who were then working with other firms, had given notice to terminate their employment in order :  &apos; to enter the service of the Company.   On the morning of the 3rd July they presented themselves at the works of the Siddeley-Deasy Company in pursuance of the arrangements already made, but, owing to the receipt of the embargo letter, a doubt arose in the mind of the works manager as to whether the men could be started.  Hence a delay of some hours occurred, during which the &apos; Manager of the Coventry Employment Exchange consulted with Messrs. Siddeley-Deasy and ;    -with the Chief Dilution Officer of the Ministry of Munitions at Birmingham.. As the result, the firm, as we are informed, actually gave employment to those workmen whom it had previously and definitely agreed to employ.   The evidence given before us on this point is, however, conflicting. It may well be that certain workmen who had expected that they could obtain employment at that establishment were unable to do so ; but ultimately, as the evidence indicates, all those who left v &apos; their employment in the hope of joining Messrs. Siddeley-Deasy procured situations either at that firm or at other firms in the town.   The above incident, however, with respect to Messrs. Sidde-ley-Deasy, and the inconvenience and delay caused to a number of workmen thereby, soon became ;  known to the general body of skilled workers in Coventry, and added to the existing irritation.37., The incident of the Hotchkiss notice must, therefore, be considered in connection with the cir-cumstances just stated with reference to the Siddeley-Deasy Company.38.. The Committee desire to point out that the embargoes imposed in no way touched the great body of skilled workmen at Coventry.   The only men who could be affected were those whq : might wish to leave their existing employment in order to join one of the embargoed firms who &quot;might seek for further skilled labour.   The Committee recognise that the three, firms (and also 1    Messrs. Daimler Co., Ltd.) are of excellent standing, and they appreciate the views expressed before them that a workman is unfavourably affected by the application of an embargo to any firm where the terms of employment may be favourable as to wages or otherwise, even though the embargo be subject to the grant of a licence.   The narrow effect, however, of the embargo in Coventry itself at that time appears from the fact that in or about that City there are some ; .  400 firms engaged directly or indirectly on munitions work.39. The Committee feel that the underlying causes of the stoppage at Coventry at a time of gravy national emergency are not to be found in the application of the embargo to the three firms, -  or in the incidents arising therefrom, but in other and more far-reaching matters, of which &apos; , isome of the more important are indicated in the latter heads of paragraph 50 of this Report.40. In view of the evidence given by several of the witnesses who appeared before us and who dealt with the contents of the actual embargo letter, it may be convenient at this point to make some observations upon it.(..-.   , (a) Paragraph 1 of the embargo letter is in the following terms:  &quot;On and after the receipt hereof you shall not engage for employment in - youi &quot;establishment without the licence of the Minister, any skilled man of any of the types ,!.       &quot;set out in the Schedule,&quot; etc. - .&apos;    ,., In view of the construction placed upon these words by more than one responsiblewitness, it would be well to make clear that they do not prohibit the employer from ,&apos; . taking into his service men who have been definitely engaged prior to the receipt of. . &apos; -    the embargo letter.   Irritation and inconvenience to the employer, and hardship to the employee, must arise if the employer should, even though erroneously, deem himself unable to&apos; fulfil an agreement which he has actually made with a workman. - (b) Paragraph 3 of the letter is in the following terms:  &quot;The expression &quot;skilled man&apos; in clause (1) and (2) includes any skilled man of &quot;any of the types specified in the Schedule at the back hereof who receives the full &quot;district rate for the work on which he is employed.&quot;The Committee appreciate that some form of definition is required for the purposes ,. . of the letter, but they think it would be desirable that it should be made clear in the-,     embargo letter itself that the definition is used solely for the purposes of that letter, and that it is not intended to affect in the slightest degree the definition of a skilled man for any other purpose, (q) Paragraph 5 of the letter is as follows :  &quot;Nothing herein stated shall affect the existing powers of the Minister to assign or &quot;transfer any man or men.&quot;
IQThese words refer to the powers of the Minister under Section 6 of the Munitions of War Act, 1915, with respect to War Munitions Volunteers.   We think it better that those words should be omitted from the embargo letter.  They create groundless alarm! I in the minds of workmen, inasmuch as they may suggest powers in the Minister which do not exist.The Committee were impressed with the statement of many witnesses as to the lack of adequate information in Coventry, prior to the 1st July with regard to the Governments embargo policy.The Ministry of Munitions was under the impression that the matter had been sufficiently elucidated in a series of announcements which had been made. In the first place, the Minister of Munitions, in a speech in the House of Commons in August, 1917, dealing with the abolition of the leaving certificates, clearly pointed to the possibility that the position of the Ministry in relation to labour might have to be safeguarded under the powers existing in the Defence of the Realm Acts by imposing some form of restriction on the engagement of labour. Again, in the course of a speech in the House of Commons on April 25th, 1918, the Minister of Munitions made the following statement:  &quot; We have now reached the point where I must make a further appeal for greater facilities &quot; in regard to the. movement to points where they are most needed of the skilled workmen &quot; who are left at home. I propose, shortly, to issue an appeal to workmen generally, press-&quot; ing them to enrol as War Munition Volunteers, so that the available residuum of skilled &quot; and efficient labour whicIT we have in this country can be moved from point to point as the &quot; needs of the time require, and so that all are employed to the highest possible advantage. &quot; It is clear that War Munition Volunteers who have undertaken to place themselves so fully &quot; at our disposal are of greater value from the point of view of indispensability to munitions &quot; output than those who have not volunteered for this special form of munitions service. Side &quot; by side with this, it will be necessary to regulate and restrict the action of employers so &quot; as to prevent the uneconomic use of labour and to enforce dilution by preventing new &quot; men being engaged, and by requiring in some cases the dismissal of men who are already &quot; employed.&quot;The matter Was further dealt with in a communication which the Minister of Munitions made to the Press on June 8th, 1918, in the following terms: &quot; The Government have had under consideration the position created in the war industries &quot; by the calling to the Colours of large numbers of men employed on production. While &quot; the man-power employed on essential war work is thus being depleted in order to meet the &quot; needs of the Army for men, it is essential to maintain, and even in some directions to &quot; increase, output in order to meet the needs of the Army and the nation.&quot; The Government appeal earnestly to all skilled workers, who are eligible to become &quot; War Munitions Volunteers, and who have not already enrolled, to enrol without delay,, and &quot; by doing so to place their services at the disposal of the Government for transfer, as and &quot; when necessary, to other essential war work to which they may be directed in the national &quot; interest. The Government hope that the response to this appeal to workers to enrol will &quot; be sufficient to meet the needs of the situation.&quot; With a view to securing the economic use of the labour employed on essential war work, &quot; instructions have been given to the responsible departments to undertake a careful survey &quot; of the labour employed on this work. If, on investigation of the labour employed in any &quot; firm, responsible officers of these departments direct that workmen should be transferred &quot; elsewhere, such men will, if not already enrolled, be asked to enrol as War Munitions &quot; Volunteers, or to satisfy the local Enlistment Complaints Sub-Committee that such enrol-&quot; ment will, in their particular case, involve great personal hardship, or that there are &quot; adequate reasons why they should not be transferred to a distance from their homes. This &quot; Sub-Committee will be empowered to modify, in certain cases, the terms of enrolment so &quot; that they shall not involve the transfer of a workman away from his home.&quot; The justification for protecting a man from military service is not merely that he possess &quot; certain industrial qualifications, but also that he is indispensable to the work on which he &quot;is engaged; a man, though employed on essential war work, whose labour is not being used &quot;to the best advantage, has no claim to continued protection from service in the Army. It &quot; is proposed to offer to such men (unless they are of an age and medical grade from which &quot; men are being called up under the Schedule of Protected Occupations) the opportunity of &quot; transferring their services to work where their labour will be more fully utilised, and where &quot;continued protection from military service can be justified.&quot; On the other hand, protection cannot justifiably be continued to those men whose &quot;services are not being used to the best advantage on their present work and who refuse to &quot; place their services at the disposal of trie Government for transfer to other essential war &quot; work where they are more urgently required.&quot; The present position calls also for fresh and sustained efforts on the part of employers. &quot; It will be necessary that all employers should review with the utmost care the present use &quot; of the man-power in their employment, and place all possible facilities in the way of the &quot;Governments officers in rendering men available for transfer. It is the intention to apply &quot; extensively the existing powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations to regulate &quot;and restrict the engagement or employment of any workman or classes of workmen in order &quot;to ensure not only a more equitable distribution of labour throughout the war industries,. &quot; but a better economy of the man-power remaining in the country.
&quot;The Government are aware that these measures involve a heavy strain upon both em-&quot; ployers and men; but they are confident that in this time of great national need everyone &quot; will realise the necessity of releasing the greatest possible number of men required for mili-&quot;tary service and the need of maintaining, at whatever sacrifice of personal convenience, the &quot;vital output of munitions.&quot;This communication, however, did not appear in the Coventry local papers, nor in the Bir-mingham evening papers generally read by the workmen of Coventry.The Governments embargo policy had also been notified to the Trade Union Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Munitions.In spite of the above speeches and communication to the Press, it would appear that the nature of and reasons for the embargo policy had not been sufficiently brought to the minds of the workmen.42. The further steps leading up to the stoppage may be briefly stated as follows.Shortly after the 3rd July the question of the suspension of work by the men was con-sidered at a meeting of the Coventry and District Joint Engineering Committee. That Com-mittee includes representatives of the engineering and allied Trades Unions in Coventry. The Joint Committee recommended that a week&apos;s notice of suspension of work should be given, and this recommendation as to notice was given effect to by the members of the various Unions on the 15th July.43. Officers of the Ministry of Munitions met the men&apos;s representatives locally, and on the 21st July an emergency meeting of the Joint Committee was held, at which the representatives of the various Unions who attended the meeting agreed by 87 votes to 24 that in the event of the Government being prepared to negotiate the administration of the embargo scheme in districts and to hold a national conference to consider the question of the utilisation of skilled labour, the meeting was prepared to recommend to the members of the Unions represented on the Joint Committee that they should suspend their notices.44. The Ministry of Munitions replied on the same day to the effect that they were in close and con-stant touch with the responsible leaders of the Trade Unions, and that they were prepared to discuss with them questions relating to the actual administration of any scheme affecting labour. The reply, in substance, continued that while the Governments considered policy in the matter of the embargo scheme could not be reviewed, yet, should representations be made by the properly accredited bodies, both of the Engineering Employers and Trade Unions as to the necessity for a further conference on the better utilisation of skilled labour, apart from the embargo, the Ministry would be prepared to enter into discussion with those bodies and such added represen-tatives as might be thought advisable. The Ministry of Munitions emphasized the fact that they could not carry on the supply of munitions to the troops without the embargo in cases where tne need was shown and without reasonable powers to distribute the skilled labour according to the vital war needs.45. A meeting convened by the Joint Committee, however, passed the following resolution on the 22nd July:  &quot; That this meeting could not accept the Governments letter. Further, that we recom-&quot;mend to the workshop representatives aggregate meeting that we suspend our notices &quot;pending National Conference of the Joint Allied Trades to which we shall send &quot;delegates in order that all skilled men shall cease work at a given date; said Conference &quot;to be held at an early date.&quot;This resolution was passed by a large majority and during the day a notice from the Secretary of the Joint Committee was posted in establishments in Coventry to the effect that a resolution had been passed by the Coventry and District Joint Engineering Committee as follows:  &quot; At the meeting of the Joint Engineering and District Committee and Workers&apos; &quot;representatives held on the 22nd July, 1918, it was resolved that we recommend the &quot;members affiliated and the Birmingham Sheet Metal Workers that we,should suspend &quot;our notice pending a National Conference of the Allied Engineering Trades.&quot;46. The members of certain Unions, however, did not abide by this resolution, and did not sus-pend their notices, with the result that the members of these Unions ceased work on Tuesday, 23rd July, 1918. The Committee have no definite information as to why the members of such Unions did not act upon the recommendation of the Joint Committee. The stoppage took place without the sanction of the Executives of the Unions.47. On the 25th July the Conference mentioned in the above resolution was held at Leeds. A responsible officer of the Ministry of Munitions, who was in the district, was prepared to attend and explain the Governments policy, but the Conference decided not to hear him, and passed a resolution recommending a general cessation of work on Tuesday, July 30th, unless the embargo scheme was meanwhile removed.Work, however, was generally resumed at Coventry on the 30th July.48. The circumstances as to the Coventry stoppage would not justify us in placing blame upon any of the officials of the Ministry of Munitions, but, judging the matter after the event, we think that the actual stoppage might have been avoided if fuller steps had been taken in June, 1918, to make known to the men and their leaders the object and scope of the embargo scheme.
50. In conclusion, the Committee desire to say that: (i.) The evidence is conclusive to the effect that the embargo scheme was necessary in the national interests in order to secure the most effective use of available labour. . (ii.) The Committee are, therefore, of opinion that the action of the Government in establish-ing the scheme was justified, (hi.) The facts disclosed before us, however, indicate the necessity for full publicity and explana-tion to workmen and employers alike of Government policy from time to time with respect to labour matters, (iv.) The supply and proper distribution of labour will become still more difficult in the future owing to the ever-growing complexity of, and demand for, munitions of war. i. (v.) The evidence established the fact that the embargo, although the immediate cause of the stoppage at Coventry and Birmingham, was not the only, or indeed the substantial, cause ;i thereof.(vi.) Although the vast majority of those who stopped work are in every way anxious to main-tain the output of munitions, there is evidence that a small section of the community, not confined to the ranks of labour, is hostile to the constitutional procedure of the Trade Union organisations of this country, and desires to take advantage of causes of irritation to bring about, if possible, a stoppage of work for other reasons than the redress of imme-diate grievances. The extent to which this section caused the cessation of work is a matter upon which the members of the Committee differ in opinion.(vii.) Amongst the matters to which importance was attached by witnesses, and which were alleged to have been the underlying causes of the stoppage, were the following:  (a) That the Government action for the purpose of redeeming the pledges given with regard to the restoration of pre-war conditions has been unduly delayed.(b) That a striking difference exists in many cases between the earnings of certain sections of skilled tfmeworkers and those men and women employed on systems of payment by results who entered their occupations since the&apos; beginning of the war as dilutees.(c) That the conditions laid down in the Munitions Acts and the Orders thereunderwith respect to women&apos;s wages have not been fully observed.(d) Complaints were also made with respect to the recruitment and the utilisation in the Army of skilled men.The matters referred to in this paragraph, together with other matters mentioned by the witnesses, will be the subject of further report.51. At the present stage the Committee desire to make the following recommendations:  (a) That means should be devised to provide that changes or developments in Government policy with respect to labour matters (so far as they concern munitions work) should be immediately and effectively communicated to the workmen and employers concerned, both centrally and locally, in order to secure their confidence and co-operation.(b) That a Joint Committee of a consultative and advisory nature be established forthwith ,(c) That its constitution should be as follows: A Chairman to be appointed by the Government.Three Trade Union Representatives to be appointed by the Engineering Group of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the Minister of Munitions.Two Trade Union Representatives to be appointed by the Trade Union Representa-tives on the National Joint Committee of the Shipbuilders and Shipyard Trade Unions.One Trade Union Representative to be appointed by the less skilled Trades Group of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the Minister of Munitions.One Trade Union Representative to be appointed by the Women&apos;s Trade Union Advisory Committee to the Minister of Munitions.49. The Committee feel that the events to which they have referred in this Report should be con-sidered in the light of the unique circumstances which have developed since the outbreak of war. g For a long time past the bulk of the skilled workers throughout the country have been living at % a high tension. The methods of production have been intensified; greater concentration of effort has taken place; excessive overtime has been worked, and holidays have been curtailed. The strain upon many workmen has been great, and the general anxieties Of the times have added to the stress of accentuated manual and mental effort. The skilled workers, moreover, have seen the ever-increasing and unavoidable extension of the dilution scheme, and have realised more fully the effect of that system to which they had assented upon the position occupied by skilled men be-fore the war. Workers who have entered the munitions industries have acquired a measure of manual dexterity and skilled knowledge, and have done much work previously performed by artificers who have spent a long apprenticeship at their trades. The unexpected prolongation of the war has accentuated greatly the sacrifices which the Unions of skilled men agreed to make.These points must not be overlooked in considering the incidents at Coventry which cul-minated in the stoppage, and they should be regarded in conjunction with the matters indicated in the latter heads of the following paragraph.
