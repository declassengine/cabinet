,   SEAMEN1 S WAGES AND THE EFFECT OF THE RECENT I -AMERICAN ADVANCE IN PAY,H?flfh\X.,^^fimiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet in reply tothe Memorandum by the Chairman of the National Maritime Board dated 18th September,1918,The. above Paper summarises its purport in the concluding paragrpahj as follows :-8It is the purpose of this Memorandum to ask oonsidera-tion of the following proposals by the War Cabinet,(a) The payment to our seamen of all ranks of a war zone bonus, the national standard rates of pay remaining as determined by the National Maritime Board,(b) The establishment in American ports of a reserve of Naval Ratings to furnish substitutes for deserters from British 3bips,As regards (a) the merchant oeamen is to-day paid considerably higher than the naval rating,, and it will undoubtedly cause an increase in the adverse comments of the fighting men of the three Services that those who are not actually in the Forces should be paid much higher rates than the enlisted men. Also that a large increase, whether it be pay, war bonus, or otherwise, in the pay of the merchant oeamen will more nearly affect the comparison by the lower deck of their respective remunerations   Thiss however, is only part of a very big question which the Cabinet will,. I venture to say* have to face in the no very distant future, on account of the large increases in pay given to munition workers, men in the industries of the country, and now on account of the proposed increase to men in the mercantile marine if it is given0   It isnot the intention, however, of the Admiralty to raise this issue in concrete form, upon the present proposal alone, although the attached statement of comparison of the pay of naval ratings and of the present and proposed remuneration of men in the&quot;mercantile marine, should be before the Cabinet when they are considering the question of remuneration now put forward by the National Maritime -Board,Dealing now with proposal (b), the writer of the Memorandum states that the Admiralty have so far refused this request mainly on the ground of the shortage of men, and suggests that the Cabinet should instruct the Admiralty    to .   furnish this small amount of man-power11,   This request comprises two fallacies.   In the first place the Admiralty has not refused, but is giving the most careful consideration to the proposal      &apos;   . and it seems premature to have brought it to the Cabinet. The proposal is a very far reaching one and involves great diffirazl-ties.   As, however, the writer desires to place&apos;it on that footing, it may be so accepted.   The second fallacy is that the Admiralty can allocate a certain small proportion of &quot;man-power&quot; to the mercantile marine0   The Admiralty has no function of allotting man-power and its income of recruits Is settled on a definite calculated manning programme of ships plus casualties and wastage which have received War Cabinet sanction, and,unlike the Army, it has no income of recruits which are not hypothecatedto certain/
155to certain purposes before thoy are enlisted, so that there oan be no question of the Admiralty allotting a surplus to the mercantile marine,   Any number of men which the mercantile marine must have yd_.ll necessarily be provided through the Minister of IMional Service; they are not included in the Admiralty quota which the Minister i-uppliesApart from these two points, however,, and dealing with the merits of the proposal , we have the following factors to oinsider.   There appears to be no roason why desertions in American ports should stop or decrease.   On the other hand, as conditions become more onerous they may be expected to increase,,   Further, there is no reason to suppose that an emergency pool of 250 men in New York, unless it were replenished* would he sufficient to provide for all desertions, and the pool of 250 men would inevitably become a reserve which had to he replenished from time to time as casualties occurred, and as men, owing to the dispersion of shipping, drifted to other parts of the world.   Therefore the question we are ashed to consider isnot one of 250 men only, hut of an-uncertain number of which no estimate has been provided.There is a further feature which is most important in considering this request from the point of view of numbers, The underlying idea of the proposal is that when a blue-jacket out of this reserve is placed on board a merchant ship to replace a deserter, the blue-jacket upon arrival in this country should, be returned to naval control, and his place on the ship be taken by a merchant seaman.   That presupposes .a surplus of merchant seamen in this country? or at any rato, an adequacy for a mercantile marine fleet which we are expecting to grow during the next twelve months.   Rut this surplus does not exist, and it is believed that the Ministry of Shipping is finding great and increasing difficulty in manning the merchant ships^, so that the blue-jacket from this reserve in America, having replaced a deserter on a ship and arriving in tho ship in Liverpool tt could not be replaced and would have to go back in the .ship and continue on board her.The real point we have to consider, therefore, is whether we are to embark upon a system of making good the shortage in merchant seamen by putting blue*-jackets on the merchant ships, and that is a problem&quot;not only of great negnitude but full of difficulties.As willi I h&amp;po, have been made clear from what is said at the opening of this Memorandum, the Navy has no unappropriated reserve of men, and further, the Royal Navy, as it is being recruited to-day, is as to over 95$ landsmen, and these landsmen have to he trained before they can take their place in the fighting ships.   It is therefore oleax* that if this contribution of blue-jackets to the mercantile marine has to take place, and if it is decided that the Navy is to provide the blue-jackets, a separate organisation and a separate allot-ment of man-power, entirely apart from the man-power allotted to the Royal Navy on its present programme, must be considered and sanctioned, andthls must be done &quot;before any drafting can take place as the Royal Navy has never had any obligation to provide seamen, for manning mercantile marine, and has made no such provision,,This very problem, in an acuter and earlier form, has been faced by the&apos; United States, and the United States Navy has adopted the principle - and indeed I think it is the only principle of working a&apos;system of this kind - that their emergency mercantile fleet shall be manned and officered and -&quot;run mainly if not entirely by the United States Navy.   Thecrews are/
crews are naval ratings, the officers are United States Naval officers, and the service is run under naval discipline.Under the present proposal that Royal Navy ratings should be ordered to take the place of deserters on merchant ships,under mercantile control, questions of discipline would arise and questions of control would ariso, which, in the opinion of the Admiralty, are almost unsurmountable. The R,NBrating in the proposed Beserve in New York could not be ordered to sign on to a ship5s articles as a part of her crew.   He therefore&apos; has got to be demobilized before he becomes a part of the crew, and then you have a demobilized man in America who may go and sign on or not as he likes - even if it is legal to demobilize him over there.   Once he is demobilized you have no particular hold upon him and thereby you arrive at an extremely unsatisfactory situation.   Even supposing you were to order the man on to the ship, he could not be forced to work as a.member of the crew, nor forced to submit to the discipline of the merchant crews he merely becomes a pas&apos;senger.      In the case of the guns1 crews on merchant ships this situation does not arise.   They are put on board as a naval unit under a leading seaman gunner under naval orders to do specific naval work on the ship, upon which they are, in fact, passengers, and come under the Captain in that respect and on that footing.    Practically the same circumstances apply to Royal Naval Signalmen put on board for oommunicating and convoy signalling work.In the view of the Admiralty, therefore, if the Ministry of Shipping are finding that they cannot adequately man the mercantile marine of the country, the Cabinet should consider the provision of an organised and trained mercantile marine personnel, which ought to be entirely separate from the Royal Navy, and naturally in addition to the quota of the national man-power provided for the Navy6The suggestion that desertions should be made: good by providing naval ratings to take their place is, in the ciroum-stances, only touching the fringe of the problom and in a way which would lead to needless difficulties connected with discipline duties and pay and friction, and which would, in accordance with the extent to which it developed, adversely affect the discipline of the Navy,(SgdJ    ERIC GEDDES,22, 09 18,
