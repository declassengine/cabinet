OCTHE CLYDE!.j.here is a strike of shipwrights on the Clyde.Practically the whole of the men of this craft in all thoyards have stopped work.   Yesterday (24th September) at amass meeting in St. Andrew1 s Hall, Glasgow, the msn, by amajority of 2,520 to 529, decided against resuming work,The strike arises out of a demand on tho part of themen for a minimum wage of  5 per week..  This demand has beenrejected by the employers) it has been disavowed by theExecutive of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation;and the Executive of the Shipwrights Trade Union has dissociateditself from the strike, and has strongly urged the men toreturn to work, but without effect.These shipwrights are working uon time&quot; and not onpiece work, and the Five Pounds rainiraum which is claimedcompares with the following figure of present wages :-s, d.Pre-war Rate   ...     ,.. 41/7/2 War Advances   ...     .,, 25/665/1/2Plus 12/2 per cent   ...   G/%.75/5/3At present, any time lost through bad weather is not paid for, so that the claim made involves an even greater increase than appears.The essential facts aro these :       On 10th September, numerous shipwrights gave a week1s notice of stoppage of work, on account of the employers&apos; refusal to concede a minimum wage
6 ; i dof  5 per wo ok. &apos; Between 10th and 17th Sopt ember, when the notices were to expire, the men presented to the Coiumittee on Production an application for a hearing on their claim for this minmiium wage, and they led it to be understood that if the Committee on Production would fix some early date for a hearing, thgry would withdraw their not loos.     A hearing was accordingly fixed for 25th September at Glasgow.   The hearing could, of course, only take place if, in the interval, -no strike occurred, and it was believed, in accordance with the understanding referred to, that the men would remain at work.   On--Wednesday, 18th September, however, about 2,000 men struck work.   On 19th September, a meeting was Mid, as the result of which it was believed that the men would return to work on Monday 23rd September.    On Saturday, 21st September, however, a further meeting was held, at which, by an over-whelming&apos; majority, tho men decided to decline to resume work. Another mass mooting was hold yesterday (24th September) in Glasgow, which was addressed by Mr. Purely of tho Shipwrights1 Society - who has been in Glasgow with some of his colleagues endeavouring to persuade the men to go back to their work. Their efforts, however, have proved unavailing, as the vote already referred to, discloses.        , -Tho result of this action is that tho Committee on Production is unable to consider the application.    It is practically certain that if tho claim had been heard, it could not have been granted, and therefore we should probably have had the same trouble after the ward of .the Committee on.-Production, as we have now.Some......
, &apos; Some other shipyard trades - such as the joiners andpatternmakers on tho Clyde, awl indeed all the time workers -have joined in the claim for a  5. minimum wage, and the ship-wrights at Barrow and on the East Coast of Scotland, have advanced a similar demand:   so that the trouble is so.easing,      Further the ioiners and wood-outting machinists have given notice that they will cease work on Saturday, and the gi&amp;gers on 6th October,I do not think that there is much hope of settling the question by any compromise on the present Time Rates,,       The shipwrights see the boilermakers alongside of them earning high wages on piece work, and they are seeking, to reach some sort of equality with them.    But it would be impossible to give them a wage such as they claim for the amount of work they do at present,, and in my view, the only solution is to induce them to adopt piece work and fix a satisfactory schedule of piece prices.    This, however, will take time9 and, in the meantime, the men must be made to see the necessity of resuming their work.The most effective way oi dealing with the situation would bs to enlist the strikers of military age for the Army. While this might be construed as a form of Industrial compulsion, and contrary to the understanding as to the uses which might be made of conscription, no valid distinction car.; be drawn between taking this course now, and employing it in the case of the Coventry strike.       It has to be keot in view, however, that there is already a shortage of shipwrights, and it is difficult to see how an extended output cf shipbuilding can be obtained if the labour complement is in any way depleted,The only alternative remedv available at the moment is to prosecute the ringleaders under Section 42 of the Defence of the Realm Act, which carries a penalty of imprisonment, and to bring every striker before the Munitions Tribunal, with a view to having him fined.       It is certain that the strikers will get no strike nay from their Union and&apos;they will verv soon get tired of being out of work, if they not only cease to earn wages, but are fined in addition^       The difficulties, however, of dealing in this way with large numbers of men are formidable^In/
In the meantime, a ballot under the constitutional forms of the Trade Union, is being taken in the Clyde District, on the question ats to whether work should be resumed or noto The ballot papers are returnable on Saturday, and we shall then know what the view of the craft as a whole ise     There are over 6,000 shipwrights in the Cl-de District, and it is possible that a different result may be reached than that which was decided upon at the meeting in St. Andrew&apos;s Hall,    Mr, Wilkie of the Shipwrights1 Union is anxious for an early Government pronounce-ment which might influence the tenOur of the vote, and he suggests that the Government might offer a Committee of Enquiry into the causes of the strike to sit after the men have returned to work., As the ostensible cause of the strike is a demand for an increase of Wages, the functions of such a Committee would clearly infringe the jurisdiction of the Committee on Production.    There is a further difficulty in the fact that similar Committees of Enquiry would no doubt be asked by all the other trades which are making similar demands.The question is brought before the War Cabinet for their consideration(signed)   R. Sa HORNEh   .Forwarded,       This Memorandum deals with a matter of urgency but it is so much affected as to further action by the R&amp;ilway Strike arm the action taken and developments thereon, that no definite recommendation is put forward at this stage.(Signed)  ERIC GEDDES.
