RECKET. 0149/5430,Copy No.War Office,Whitehall,S.W.1,24th September, 1918.Secretary,War Cabinet.Supply of essential material to the Russian forcesin Siberia.        &quot; &apos;I forward, for the information of the War Cabinet, copies of three telegrams No. 52 17th September, No, 3 3.9th September and No.72 21st September, from General Knox, at Vladivostok, dealing with the question of organization and supply of the Russian troops which it is hoped to raise in Siberia,As the War Cabinet are aware, the question as to the responsibility for the organization of the Russians is now at is.sue between the French Government and ourselves, *In the meantime it is apparent, that in default of urgent action on the part of one or other of the Allies the possibility of any organization at all is in jeopardy.   It is, in any event, doubtful whether the French, should it eventually Ce decided that they should undertake the training, could provide the whole or even a part of the necessary material.In these circumstances, I ask for authority from the War Cabinet to proceed with the provision and despatch of such articles of clothing and equipment as it may be possible for us to provide, up to the limit of 100,000 men, as advocated by General Knox, without prejudice to the settlement of the issue as to the training of - the Russians,(sd.)   HENRY WILSON, &apos;C * I .G . S i
From:- General Knox, To:-    D.M.I,Di 12,40 p,m, 21,9,18, R, 10,30 a,mf 22.,9,18-.72.Two days ago Admiral Kolchak arrived here,, I saw him yesterday. On Sunday he is going west with Gaida, He thinks Gaida&apos;s appointment as C,in 0, on Volga the only salvation, he is extremely hitter against Japanese and Americans and went so far as to say that as the Japanese have no Intention of giving real help, it would be better they should not go beyond Lake Baikal, Of course his antipathy to Japanese dates from his quarrel at Harbin but he quotes their high-handed conduct in seizing public buildings at Khabarovsk and Amur steamers as prirr.es of war. As regards the Americans he was thinking of projected railway transfer of which of course he was informed by Ambassador Krupenski, He repeats that everyone thinks that except from England there is ns hope-, Paris and Colonel Pichon are accompanying Gaida and I am sending Steveni-. I wish I could make you realise what opportunities our prestige had and how these are being lost, The British out here, preeminently Consul KodgsOn, Commodore Payne, and Steveni had done grand work. The Russians had been led to expect great things of my coming, Semenof, Gaida, and others have come down to see me and not any Japanese or Frenchmen., I cannot even give them promises, Unless within two months uniform and equipment (I group undecipherable) delivered for Russians called up beyond Lake Baikal, the men will return to their homes and mobilisation will then be impossibleCan you not order 100,000 sets of British uniforms and equipment with warm underclothing in Canada and U.S, pending settlement of differ-ences ? Then I could keep up the Russian hopes and prove at all events our nation has come to help.
3 E 0 R E T .20FroirK - General Knox, Vladivostock. To:-      C.I.G...S.Despatched 4.40 p,m.. 19th September, 1918. Received 11.55 p.m. 20th September, 1918.No, 3 Personal.Foreign Office telegram No. 39 to High Commissioner giving substance of the French reply has been shown to me.The reply commences by enunciating 4 &quot;view&quot;.     Of these number 2 is undecided.     Everyone will agree with others the Russian Army in Siberia should be national of course. Russian cadres of course should be sent from France provided that the men and officers are carefully selected and the commander of course should be a Russian,     I have not seen a copy of our despatch to French Government but it seems to have conveyed impression that we wished to Anglocise the Russian Army.   These were it is true Kolchaks views but other Russians do not share them.     The French Government as far as can be understood argues that its mission should have general control because:lat cadres are being selected from Russian units in France and Macedonia.2nd Siberian troops are being organized in liaison with Czech forces and the command Czechs has been given to a French officer, General Janin,3rd President Wilson only agreed to intervene in order to aid the Czechs.     He will look with a more favourable eye on th formation of Russian units if they are raised in liaison with the Czechs.4th In Northern Russia the British command has been unsuccessful in its efforts to raise&apos;Russian forces. As regards the first argument     there is hardly a single Russian officer or man that would not prefer to serve with a British organization in view of the relations which existed between the French and Russians in Macedonia
and to a certain extent In Franco.2. The Russian troops aro working with Czechs at front.     In rear the cadro3 are entirely Russian and it Is with these cadres we will have to dealt    General Janins appointment seems a mistake.    Ho has no war experience.    General Galda&apos;s particular type of mind Is more suitable to the present situation on tho Volga. Tho Czech want shirts and boots and not Foreign Gonorals.3. This soems far fetched.4. The lack of success in Northern Russia has nothing to do with tho nationality of the Allied Commander.    I warned you there could be no success there for tho forces are operating In an almost uninhabited country.     The Foreign Office has simply communicated the French reply but gives no hint as to the final decision.    At tho same time a final docision is demanded from the Allied Governments at any sacrifice of personal and national vanity within certain limits.    Negotiations with French should have commenoed when we left England instead as they apparently did when we arrived in Japan,     I believe honestly that Russian officers with very few exceptions would prefer ? organization in liaison with a British Mission.Financial and material help is far* more urgently required than arc instructors.Dietrichs, who is acknowledged by the French to bo tho best man for organization out here, refuses to start work if he is to depend on a French Mission for such help. He states he never during a single month could got the funds he required for pay and equipment of Czechs.    The French took over the payment of Kalmikovs from Japanese and Kalraikovs being 2 months in arrears has now appealed to us,I have already proposed that the French should take over the provision of advisor in cavalry and artillery and we
should provide offloors as adviser in infantry (?) fighting.    If this is insufficient perhaps they should take over all the training and my mission should struggle with provision of equipment.It is doubtful how the latter arrangement would work and it would be preferable from our point of view to let them take everything of eourse.An immediate decision is required, for apart from this new difficulty *he selfishness of Ameri^xms and Japanese is already jeopardising a policy whi&amp;h offered every prooise of being a brilliant success.
