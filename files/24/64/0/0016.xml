SITUATION IN NORTHERN RUSSIAN PORTS.

GENERAL BLISS, having declared the Meeting open, stated that they had been called together by General Sackville-West to discuss the situation in the MURMANSK Peninsula and at ARCHANGEL. He would therefore call upon the British Military Representative to explain the subject.

GENERAL SACKVILLE-WEST, Said that the subject they had met together to discuss could be summed up as follows :-

Firstly, ought the Military Representatives to advise an increase to the expendition already authorised for ARCHANGEL ? and, if so, what should that increase be ?

Secondly, if the Military Representatives were agreed that reinforcements were necessary, where could these be found ? What Ally or Allies could find the necessary troops ?

Further, if the Military Representatives arrived at the conclusion that an increase was wise and necessary, they must consult and obtain the permission of the Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the Allied Armies in France, since the Military

Representatives  


Representatives had already stated in their Joint 1*1 etc No.37, recently agreed to, that no diminution must bo made from the forces which the Marshal considered to be necessary in franco. The reasons for increasing the force at ARCH&apos;.J;G !L were fully set forth in General Pooled telegram, a copy of which had he en received by each of his colleagues,The Military Representatives would remember that an expedition to archangel had been recorm;jcndod: firstly, with a view to safeguard that port; secondly with the object of -assisting those Czecho-Slovak contingents west of ORkSK who wished to be transported to France.   The total Allied forces which had arrived at ^rghanojjij, together with those en route, or earmarked for - arciungrel.v amounted to 12,000 men.     With tho forces which had already arrived, General Poole had advanced to 0B&amp;RZJBR8KAIA,     Originally it had been hoped that considerabl forces would rally to the Allied banner: but that hope had not boon fulfilled.     On the other hand, between tho ARCHANGEL Allio forces and the Czech forces, situated in the region of PixE&amp;, the existed a block of enemies (German prisoners, Bolsheviks, and other elements), who intervened between the two forces and so prevented their joining up.-,     General Poole had now reported that, in order to get into touch with the Czocho-Blovaks:, a furtt force consisting of 5 battalions of infantry and 6 batteries of artillery wore required^     It was, therefore., left to the IviilitaH Representatives to consider :Firstly, whether reinforcements should now (that id, before tho winter sets in) be sent to ARGJLu]gfjbi in order &quot;to carry out General PooleTs intentions,     Or,Secondly, whether an increase:.to General Poolers forces should be despatched in the bp ring-.     Or,Thirdly, whether they should merely recommend that no additional forces should be sent.In his (General Sackvillo-Vest Ts) opinion, there was one oti important point on which he wished to lay stress. They as. will Representative8 must not advise the taking of great risks that would load to failure-. In their last Note, they had expressed tl opinion that an Eastern front should bo re-constituted with a vij to drawing troops from the Western front., Consequently,&apos; any act to be taken in the Russian theatre of war must harmonise with th demands of the Western front, the decisive theatre of war,fie had not mentioned the question of MUBMAM.SK, since all difficulties in that region had been settled for the time being,, kURLiAiJSIC and HlTCEMGrA might now be considered reasonably safe i reasons which he had already fully explained in a communication which ho had addressed to his colleagues.(MSHAL BLISS enquired whether the reinforcements which had recently been sent by the British Government wore intended for imftiAJisk or for iiKCHAJGEL.GENERAL SAQgyilLJii-^Sg replied that they were to proceed to LURl&apos;.a&apos;iNSlC, in order to secure the safety of that port and of ISTCHENGA, and more especially with a View to prevent any enemy submarine bases being started in that quarter.GgHERAl BLISS asked whether WmMSfc would be considered safe if the troops now between   iuhviafse .and EMvi were allbrought
brought back to IJJRIMSK, and if at the saiau time the rcin-force merits now be in/? sent to jrUTOANSITwure diverted to ARCHANGEL.GENERAL SACKVILLE-WE5T replied that he did not think that would be the case,GENERAL PI ROlILANT held the view that it was always very difficult to foresee what mi/iht happen in a distant theatre of war.Comt.qm.ntly, the Military Representatives had probably erred when.they recommended the 3ending of a small force to the *!!ertlk rn ports, accompanied by a resolution that no mere reinforcements would be sent.   This resolve proved to be wrong, as had been seen by the fact that the British Government had already been compelled to despatch additional trrops.   And now General Poole asked for more reinforcements, and in his opinion his demand was reasonable, and should be met.   LTJRIvIANSK having been assured, it was essential that ARCHATGEL should also bo made secure.   Therefore, if possible, troops should be sent.But this at once opened out another question, as had been clearly explained by the British Liilitary Representative in his opening statement, namely -the moment they were agreed that reinforcerntnts should be sent, the question at once arose as to which of the Allies were in a position to find the necessary troops.   Whence could they be got ?   Could troops be withdrawn from the Western front ?   That was a question which the Ilarshal Commanding-in-Chief the Allied Armies on the Western front alone could decide.It would be in the recollection cf his colleagues that at a previous meeting of the Military Representatives v-, (General di Robilant), had stated that thou:$i in favour of sending reinforcements, Italy nould not afford to spare any. To-day he could only repeat that statement.   But, on the other hand, he va/uld be willing to recommend that reinforce-ments be withdrawn and sent from the Western front always provided that Marshal Foch agreed.GENERAL BELIN said that he agreed with the observation just made but would like to add a corollary.   At first a number of troops had been asked for which was now insufficient^ YZhat were General. Poole * 9 reasons for requesting reinforce-ments ?   It.was apparently in order to fulfil the second part of his mission and to effeot a liaison with the Czechs. In order to do this he must break through the opposition which, in the neighbourhood of VOLOGDA, interrupted commu-nications between ourselves and PERT,:,   General Beiin tinned, to point out that a change had come over the mission. The expedition had originally been undertaken to facili-tate the passage of the Czeoho-Slovak3 to France.   Now, the Czecho-Slovaks were not intended for the Western front.   Their mission was different.   They were to furnish a nucleus for the revival of the Eastern front,   Whatvas being clone to this cn*d ?   Means were bein.3 fleught of reinforcing them from another point, namely, VLABIV06T00K1. Communications had improved and towards the BAIKAL region--&apos; were now unhampered.   Reinforcements amounting to 2, 3, or 4 Japanese divisions were already in existence.
She appearance of these reinforcements and the success already achieved by them were tending to form Russfian contingents of growing strength around them.     Gereral Poole had perhaps been rather sanguine in hoping for 100,000 volunteers in the region of the Northern ports. This region is not very populous but in the. region of PERM, SAHARA, and still further East according to M. Qkulitch, who was the chief of a considerable Siberian group,, the population was ready to form up around Inter-&apos; Allied detachments.    The present moment seemed e favour-able one as winter was about to begin and work on the land must cease.     New reinforcements might come from that side whose material and. moral assistance might render active propaganda possible instead of concealed propaganda followed hitherto.    We should see new detachments forming everywhere and this would re-verse the problem.     These groups, whether Gzecbo-Slovaks or otherss would take it on themselves to move towards ABQHAIGBL and to establish liaison with General Poolers forces.    He was, therefore, of opinion that we should not follow the plan of small successive reinforcements, especially as the source of e &amp;3h reinforcements could not be in 1&apos;aly or France, and if it were Gffiat Britain, which h&amp;d .J&quot;-:wt made a new of fort, it could nnly &quot;be at the Q2.-y^R4c- of the main front, that,is, the Western front.     In conclusion, he was of the opinion that, for the time being, no new troops should be sent, and would prefer to trust to events happening elsewhere to allow of the achievement of the original plan,gjiweiujx BLISS asked leave to read the following statement:-31.    On June 3rd, 1018, the,Supreme wrr Council, at,.its Sixth Session, adopted a resolution which expressed tie view that it is impossible to fore-see ultimate victory in the war unless the American force aggregates not less than 100 divisions., snd that this total force should, be assembled in France at as earlv: a date as it can -oosslblw be done.-   On June &apos;23rd./ifershal 3? )ch addressed a teleriam to the President of the United States stating that in order to win the victory in 3.919 at was necessary to attain a numerical superiority which can be obtained only if there are 80 American divisions in France in April, 19&quot;&apos;9f and 100 divisions in July, 1919.     On July    nd, 1918, at its Seventh Session, the&apos;Supreme War Council adopted a resolution which provided that should the American Government be unable to find all the tonnage required to meet thisprogramme, the British Government should &quot;be asked to supply any deficiency.
4ow. 51 &quot;*&quot;2.    In reoponsa to this demand, th* President of tha United States has approved a programme for the assembly of 80 American divisions in France by June 50th, 1919.upon the condition, inter alia, that Great BriifcLn will supply troop and cargo Tonnage to meet American deficiencies pending the realisation of the American , shipbuilding programme.   Moreover, the Military Representatives have yesterday signed Joint Note Ho 37 in which they recommend to the Supreme War Council that all the necessary tonnage be provided toy the Allies to permit the realisation of the American effort demanded by the Supreme War Council*&quot;3*    All of this shows plainly that the Supreme War Council and the Military Representatives regard the assembly of not less than 80 American divisions in Prance by July, 1919, as a matter of paramount importance.    Set the accomplishment of even the SO division programme is still a matter of doubt and probably cannot be ensured without the imposition of still&apos;further economic restrictions upon the Allied Peoples *    tinder these circumstances the American Representative   feels that every serious question in now brought bet ore the Military&apos; Representatives for solutionu    And wo ought to solxre it clearly and In such 8 way that there &quot;can bo no doubt as to our meaningfH4.    Is the effort already demanded of the United States to be paramount* or is it to be secondary to ihi expedition to North Russia or to any other quarter t!i50    Is it true that the expedition to North Russia requires, apparently, only a small increase In personnel and material *    And this increase Is insignificant compared with tho total forces engaged on the Western front,   But this Increase in personnel ind material will probably require an increase in tonnage.    And however Insignificant in itself this increase of tonnage may be, it is not insignificant in view of the fact that it will reduce to that extent the already- insufficient tonnage for thu effort demanded of America.&quot;6e ,   Everything that Is now happening gives a more and more reasonable hope that if there be no diversion of effort the war will be ended on the Western front by the disastrous detfsat of our enemies there long before an Allied front can be reconstituted in Russia *   If that be the ease,, every Allied soldier found in Russia when the end comes will be a soldior wasted *&quot;7.    However this may be, the American Representative finds it very difficult, after joining with his colleagues in a declaration that the Allies must provide sufficient tonnage to enable one of them to make a certain effort demanded of it by the Supreme War-Council as en essential condition to victory next year^ to now join with his colleagues, before the ink is dry on their previous declaration in a recommendation that a single ton of the already deficient tonnage be devoted to another purpose.H8*    It is true that If one of the Allies possesses sufficient tonnage end sufficient soldiers and supplies for the expedition to North Russia it may devote them to this purpose if it so chooses.   But it should not ask the Military Representatives to formally approvesuch
such act ion, immodiat ely after tn^e--HcpT^entertdLres&apos; have recommended something radically opposed to ouch action,&quot;9o   The Military Representatives have.,just signed and transmitted to their respective Governments a Joint Kote in which they declare that in their judgment success next year demands that the British and French forces be maintained at undiminiohed strength and that American forces continue to come to France at not less than their present rate.     How can this be done if additional forces are to be sent to a secondary theatre and additional tonnage be employed for this purpose? We cannot consistently sign any such recommendation without first modifying our previous one,&quot;10. In conclusion I beg to. submit to my colleagues the following suggestion.     As we already know, the Government of the United States has formally&apos; communicated to the Allies in Europe the limited nature of its aims in Russia and the limited contributions it proposed to make for the attainment of those aims. But, at the same time, that Government informed those Allies that it neither desired nor attempted to impose any limitation upon their freedom of individual action. Will it not be better, therefore, if the Military Representatives invite the attention of the Governments to these facts and suggest to them that such of them as desire to pursue further the venture in North Russia agree among themselves as to their contributions in men and material?&quot;11. If, however, these Governments demand of the Military Representatives&apos; their professional military opinion as to the wisdom of making further contributions of men and material for the expedition to Kbrth Russia, the opinion of tho American Military Representative is :**1.      Viet cry is now awaiting the Allies on the Western front and can be delayed beyond reasonable expectation only by the diversion of military effort for uncertain ventures elsewhere,2*      And that, therefore, the operations in North Russia should be governed by the original excellent and well-considered directions issued to General Poole by the British T%r Office, which distinct-ly contemplated no further reinforcements this year.MHe understood that the object of the exchange of views which was taking place at this Meeting was to determine(i)      whether a Joint Hote should be drawn up-and&apos; submitted to their respective Governments, and(ii)      whether they should or should not despatch additional reinforcements to the Northern Russian Ports.He asked his colleagues to say whether they wished to express any further views on this question.
GJSNEBAL 5ACKVILLU-WHIST said that h   did not wish to enter into a discussion regarding what had boon said.     In princi-pic they wore all apparently in agreement.     He wished to &apos; i invite attention, however, to the fact that Joint Note Ho.37, rotating to the military policy to be followed by the Allies had not b-on received by his Government when the request for further reinforcements, which tnoy were now considering, had he en made,In that Joint loto the Military Representatives had stated that sufficient tonnage should be supplied to meet the requirements of Marshal Pooh.     Consequently, if any surplus tonnage existed, they did not bind themselves that it couldnot he used elsewhere.     As &quot;far as he himself was concerned he could not join in a resolution to his Government to the effect that no tonnage was to be employed except for Prance. Were they to agree to such a resolution it would he impossi-ble to say what they would bo committing themselves.     It was unnecessary to say that demands for tonnage came to the United Kingdom for transport of men and supplies all over the world.His colleagues had expressed their views in unmistakable terms against the sending of reinforcements to ARCHANGEL, He was,&quot;therefore, prepared to express that view to his Government and in his opinion no Joint Koto appeared to be required.     He thought that a communication of this nature would fully meet the case.GjMKAL BLISS expressed his full concurrence with the proposal of the British Military Representative, and enquired whether that was also the view of his colleagues.GEKBRAL BgLIN said that he agreed to remain loyal to the principles which had served as the foundation of Jaint^tfote No. 37.     The effect of this l;lotc was that reinforcements could not and should not be sent to other theatres of war. It had been stated that each Government was free to dispose of such troops or tonnage as were not absorbed.by the Western Front.    He could not agree to this statement, as it was in contradiction to the principles of Joint Note Ho,37, that is, that all our efforts should converge towards the principal  . front.     What could be asked for was that the organisation of Russian elements on the spot should be carried out more :  ! v actively.     All he could say was to tell the Generals Command-in-Chief that nothing further could bo sent to them and all help required by them must be found locally.     We could advise them to carry on intelligent propaganda and to trust to the good will and devotion of our officers who have cam-paigned in Russia and are still there.     This effort should be maintained until opposition is overcome and until a suffi-cient contingent of* volunteers is formed to re-constitute the Eastern Front.     All the Military Representatives should do, therefore, was to advise those concerned to persevere in the formation of volunteer contingents attached to the forces of General Poole or to those of General Janin who had received appropriate instructions.GENERAL PI ROBILAHT inquired whether the reinforcements now asked for by General Poole were intended for the pro-tec t ion of the Port of ARCHANGEL in the same way as rein-forcemente had been sent by the British Government for the protection of MURMANSK.     Or, were these reinforcements intended&apos; to
to proceed South with a view to joining up with the Czecho-Slovaks?  He made this enquiry because the Military Representatives had stated in Joint Note No. 31 that it was of the highest importance to hold these Northern bases. Therefore, if General Poole had asked for reinforcements ? with the object of protecting those ports, the question assumed a different aspect.

GENERAL-SACKVILLE-WEST said that he believed the forces already in ARCHANGEL were sufficient for the protection of that port.

GENERAL BELIN agreed that this was the inference from Commandant Lelong&apos;s report. He was at present on a mission in France, and had personally informed General Belin that these reinforcements were intended to advance eventually to VOLOGDA. 

GENERAL BLISS then proposed the following Resolution :-

"The Military Representatives authorise the British Military Representative to inform his Government that they are unable to recommend the despatch of further reinforcements to ARCHANGEL during the course of the present year."

(This was agreed to.)
