AdmiraIty, ^Meinoraridiim for tjne War...Cabinet.The introduction into Naval Warfare of new methods, such as the employment of submarines, has raised new problems,,, the solution of which is essential for maintaining the efficiency of the Navy, and has brought into prominence the wide scope which exists for the employment of&quot;Physical prirr-oiples and methods which have not hitherto received practical application,,It will be difficult in the future to maintain Naval Supremacy or keep abreast of develop ments -in other countries, unless the fullest and most immediate use is made of all possible applications of science^ and it is obvious that the submarine&apos; menace would have been much less serious and less difficult to combat had a complete study been made, prior to the War, of, for example, the principles of the transmission of sound and the penetration of electrical radiation through water.    Such principles require exhaustive study on the purely scientific side before their applicability I to Naval purposes can be established, and this study should be made in close co-operation with the Navy and under conditions! which secure a reasonable degree of secrecy.In order that the fullest facilities for research work of such vast Importance to Naval Effort should be avail-able , it is considered essential that the Navy should have an Institution of its own, which could survey the,whole field of    I Physics for principles suitable for application to Naval pro-    1 blems and could mate further researches to test whether such principles show promise of utility., ISuch fundamental researches would be of a more      . 1 varied and general character than the existing Scientific IDepartments of the Navy could undertake, and,&quot;in view of the     1 magnitude of the undeveloped field for research, the absence     1 of commercial inducements&apos;likely to attract private enterprise  1 to this branch of study and the&apos;necessity of the Institution     j being confidentially informed as to Naval policy, it is thought  f that a separate Institution for the Navy is a necessity,-, although its work would be carried on in close connection with the National Physical Laboratory which devotes its energies to research,and investigation for the benefit of manufacturers generally, and various commercial interests which employ it.Merely illustrations of the type of research which    1 it is suggested that a separate Naval Institution should \undertake, may be mentioned 1
(a) the fun damental principles which may be applied to the detection and location of Submerged ships at a distance,(b) the propagation of explosive waves through water.(c) the transmission of sound, both audible and inaudible, through water, and(d) the search for a type of electrical radiation capable of penetrating freely through water-which is a scientific possibility as yet but little explored.The discovery and adoption of an entirely new scientific method would be likely to give our Navy a more decided advantage than a mere technical improvement of well-known existing methods, and the proposed Institution should prove of the highest value in indicating scientific possibili-ties and in promptly carrying out investigations to test their utility.    If such utility were established, the subject would then be transferred to one of the Special Departments of the Navy for development into the form most suitable for Naval needs and manufacture on a commercial scale,The proposal to which this Memorandum relates has been exhaustively considered bv Sir J. J.Thompson, O.M.,D.Sc., Ph.D. ? F.R.S., Sir Ernest Rutherford, D.Sc. ,&apos;Ph.D. .F.R.S.,and S?,r Richard Threlfall, 1VB.S., who have carried out invaluable research work during the war, and they are unani-mously of opinion that the best method of making the services of science available for the needs of the Navy would be to establish a Naval Research Laboratory for Physics., for the purpose of making scientific research of a fundamental and pioneer character on all problems underlying the work of the Navy.    They point out that pure scientific research and discovery supply the principles and necessary data which serve as the raw material for invention and that, with the aid of a special Institution whose primary object is to provide such material for the Navy, the work of the Special Departments already in existence should have much fuller scope,   .They also recommend that the Director of the Laboratory should be a Physicist distinguished for his abilities&apos;as an investigator, and that ne should be assisted -by a strong scientific staff chosen for their efficiency in research in the various branches of Physics,With regard to the cost of such an Institution, these three most distinguished professors take the view that a sum of  400,000 would be sufficient to cover the necessary capital outlay on the site, building and equipment, and to form a fund for keeping the Laboratory supplied with the necessary apparatus, and they suggest, in order that the scale of salaries should compare favourably with those- paid by the larger Universities and other Research Institutions in the Country, that the salary of the Director should be  1,500 together with a house allowance of  500, and that the salaries of heads of Departments, probably 5 or 6 in number, should-be from  750 to  1,250 per annum.The enemy are fully aware of the advantages which accrue from the application to warfare of the results of
scientific research, and it, may be mentioned that in May last it was reported in German newsoapers that the Kaiser had sanctioned&quot;the founding of an Institute in which men of science will co-operate &quot;with the military to discover and develop new means and methods for the purpose of war,the work to be&quot;carried on in six Departments, including a Department for Physics.    It is&quot;clearly of extreme importance that no enemy should in future be able to surprise the Navy with some weapon embodying novel scientific principles.It is desired that the 7Jar Cabinet should approve in principle the establishment of such an Institution for the Navy as is proposed, in which case a strong Committee of Scientific and other Experts would be appointed to develop the proposal, to appoint a Director, and&quot;to make definite recommendations in regard to the site and equipment of the Laboratory, so that after the War the erection of the Laboratory may proceed without delay, &quot;temporary provision being made, in the meantime, for the accommodation of the nucleus of the staff in a Laboratory in London.    It is very desirable that such a nucleus staff should be aware that their work has a permanent value and will not be interrupted by the termination of the War.It is thought that no consideration of a possible reduction in Naval requirements after the War need or should interfere with the immediate adoption of a policy in regard to this matter, as, whatever thiTfuture may have in store, the Physical Research facilities of the Country are insufficient even for ordinary trade purposes, and many such Institutions will be required.(sd) Eric Geddes.16.9.18.
