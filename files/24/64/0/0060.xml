- /.UiR MUNITION VOLW1T3.ERV  .:.UBOI ^EMOIi AhhOhAKOE. (Circulated by the Minister of Munitions.)V/tion the .,ai Cabinet authorised tho extension ofthe :.ar Munitions Volunteer sohemo and what is how known as the Embargo scheme, the Trade Union Advisory Committee pressed again and very strongly that tho subsistence allowance of 2/6&amp;. per day granted to War Munitions Volunteers was no longer sufficient; the increased cost of livinjc end lodging allowance necessitating some further advance. General Smuts and Mr. Barnes assented to an increase of l/- per day subject to Treasury sanction.     The Treasury are unable to see their way to agree to this increased allowance.It must be remembered that the rate of 17/61, per week was fixed in tho early days of 1915 on pre-war practice, and thoro is no question but that out-working allowances have boon increased, very generally by employers throughout the country, and further that the expense to ..ar Munitions Volunteers has materially advanced.    It must also be remembered that this allowance is only paid to tho ,ar Munitions Volunteer who is put to tho expense of maintaining himself and his homo from which ho is transferred to work elsewhere.Unrest amongst l/ar Munitions Volunteers is growing, The Lrbour Department of the Ministry of Munitions has been  , able to maintain continuity of work at the Rolls Royce   orks where over one-third of the skilled men are  ,ar Munitions Volunteers, only by informing the men that the matter was under consideration and that an announcement would be made at an early &amp; ate.
The Executives cf Trade Unions have been pressing the point on the Department continually for over 13 months, and have stated that under to-day!s conditions they cannot recommend their members tc enrcl.The Interim Report of the HoCardio Committee of inquiry on Labour jmb&amp;rgoes has been published - this week, and in view of the fact that it not only affirms the necessity for the embargoes but makes no suggestion that will at all meet the views of those workmen who struck on account of the einbergoI am of opinion that if the ..ar Cabinet agree to the proposed increase, an announcement to this effect should be made with the least possible delay.ii copy of the memorandum sent by the Department to tho Treasury sotting out the esti iatea cost of the increase is attached.It should further be appreciated that should the War Cabinet give thoir consent to my proposal, an increase of perhaps a similar rmount would be neoessary to workmen enrolled under the Ministry of national Service schemes, and to workmen in the Building Trccle.I r.sk the &apos;.&quot;ar Cabinet&apos;s authority to increase the subsistence allowance of ..ar Munitions Volunteers and Army Reserve Munitions ..orkers by a l/- per d?.y.(:.:g:o. )  miTOii : c,;.u..uhill.Eo. * 18.
