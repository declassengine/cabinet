MEMORANDUM on THE PRESS CONTROVERSY ON FOREIGN POLICY.

The recent controversy on foreign policy began as a duel between the Coriere della Sera and the Giornale, d&apos;Italia. Other journals joined in on the one side or on the other, public men like Barzilai and A. Torre intervened with letters and interviews intended to pour oil on the waters and various patriotic, irredentist and political associations took occasion to set forth their views. Finally the Giornale and its seconds, having secured an apparent triumph, owing chiefly to the fact that Signor Orlando was unwilling to break finally with Baron Sonnino, proceeded to carry the war into the enemy&apos;s country by giving prominence to and interpreting in ? partem, every piece of news which could cast suspicion on Jugo-Slav intentions towards Italy. (1) and betraying openly their hostility to the whole Italo-Slav entente movement, approved by Sonnino.

In this campaign full advantage is taken of (1) the ignorance of the Italian public and (2) of the ? position in which the Slavs of Austria-Hungary are placed by liability to police interference and by the fact that any premature action would obviously damage their cause.

The article of the Corriere della Sera which opened the controversy was supposed to have been provoked by a series of articles in the Persevaranza (extreme Right and not very important) attacking the whole &apos;nationalities&apos; policy, which, it maintained, could only help towards federalisation in Austria,, and applauding Sonnino for putting spokes in its wheel. The Corriere protested against the raising of a Jugo Slav question which, since the Congress
of Rome, no longer existed and against the tendency to make a ^fetich&apos; of Sonnino, whom it accused of doing everything in his power to throw doubt on Italy&apos;s sinoerity in execution of the Nationalities1 policy.   In support of this accusation it pointed to (1) the fact that the Italian Convention regard-ing the Czecho-Slovak Legion was signed by Orlando hut not by Sonnino;   (2) the non-adherence of Sonnino to the Allies recognition of the Czeohc-Slovak Council; (3) thei exclusion of Roumanians not natives of the Monarchy from the Roumanian legion;   (4)   the difficulties put in the way of the enrol-ment of volunteers from the 1nationalities&apos;;   (5) &quot;other faets, great and small, which the Censorship would not allow us to make puhlio&apos;, and (6) (hut in a later artiole) the obstruction offered by Sonnino at Versailles to the Allies&apos; proposed recognition cf the Jugo-Slav movement,, The article goes on to point out the dangers involved in this equivocal attitude of the Italian Government,   Orlando must know, it is urged, that the real question is whether Italy does or.does not wish for a united effort of all the forces hostile to Austria;  he must knew that, in the event of Austria saving herself from a break-up, the fact that Italy had obstructed that effort would greatly weaken her right to be listened to at the Peace Conference in regard to her own claims.  Finally an appeal is addressed to Orlando&quot; to clear up the situation without delay.The Giorna^e  replying denied that between Orlando and Sonnino there existed anything more than a 1difference of temperament1, em-phasized the importance of retaining intaot the &apos; Treaty of London1 (whioh L^Eooca, is taken to task for referring to as a Memorandum1.  For the Giornale  it is always the very &apos;ark of the Covenant).fes to
the iJuso-Slav question, both statesmen were agreed In viewing with every sympathy the aspirations of the oppressed rajee., but It was for the latter to co-operate seriously in the work of liberation for whioh Italy was spending her blood and treasure.  Unlike the Czeuho-Slovaks. who were rendering suoh splendid -service to the cause, the Jugo-Slavs*were still on their trial.    It was moreover ooiamon know-ledge that the Jugo-Slav movement was not yet stabilised and was still tending in various directions, . Was Italy therefore to renounce her claims for the sole benefit of Austria-Hungary; not yet beaten or dismembered?  In the-hour of victory Italy would not be lntransigeant, greedy or oppressive.In Its next artiole (August 20th) the corriere intro-duces two new topics (1) the service - not due to Sonnino18 initiative * whioh the *Patto di Roma&apos; had rendered to Italy in restoring the balance after Caporetto and Brest-Litovsk; (2) the Importance of securing the approval of President Wilson, who had not signed the Treaty of London, by a clear polity based on the Principle of Nationality.And so the controversy proceeded, the chief storm-centres being (a) the divergence between Orlando&apos;s and Sonninofs interpretation of the &apos;Patto di Roma&apos;; (b) the value of the Treaty of London and (o) its compatibility or incompatibility with the *Patto di Roma1; (d) the question of renunciations (e) the sincerity of the Southern Slav demand for independ dence of Austria and the attitude of the Southern Slave towards Italy;   (f) the wisdom or otherwise of recognising the Southern Slav claim to be united in a single independent (I  State.But the whole quarrel amounts to this.  The Corfiere protested against the sabotage by the Coneulta of the polioy initiated at the congress of Rome and formally
approved by the whole Government.^ke Giornale denied the charge and then proceeded to go one better than the Consulta.(There were inherent weaknesses in the Corriere della Sera1s position.    There were many facts damaging to the sincerity of the Consults - whioh it was not in a position to mention.    It was by the nature of the circumstances impossible, e.g.. to prove in any positive way convincing to the general public that a vast majority of the Jugo-Slavs of Austria are unoompromiBing in their demand for indepen-denoe.    The Jugo-Slavs are under various governments and-cannot speak with a single authoritative voioe.     Their doings and sayings are1 limited by police surveillance and news of them tends to become transformed en route before it reaches Italy via Switzerland.    Moreover in Italy before the war public interest in and knowledge of the Slavs of Austria-Hungary was slight.    The 1irredenti&apos; and their friends are the most interested and they are precisely the Italians who, having suffered most from the Slav advance in the Ad-riatic regions, are most prejudiced.   (Better organisation and oo-ordination of the Jugo-Slav movements in the various pro-vinces of Austria-Hungary is in this connection very much to be desired.    This co-ordination appears to have been the chief aim of the recent Conference at laibach).The issue would have been clearer if the Qorriere della Sera had been prepared openly to demand an immediate revision of the Treaty of London but this is desired neither by the bulk of Italian opinion nor we believe by the or-ganisers of the Italo-Slav Entente on the Slav-side, e.g.,-M. Trumbic.An examination of the oharacter and influence of the papers whioh took up a position in the controversy shows that the out-and-out supporters of the Giornale wore few,
- 9 - 270e ompaxatlvel^r unimportajifc -aaid. mostly of known * Neutral 1st1 (1)tendency,       The Giornale itself has of oourse a certain prestige hut its oiroulation outside Rome is not large &amp; its influence limited to conservative circles.   On the other side, the Cpxriere has a larger circulation than any newspaper in Italy and his great influence with the mass of the middle-class, while the Secolo Is the recAg-nised organ of the Radicals - who are manorous and active especially in the manufacturing centres0   It is to he noted,too,that the Ccrrlere d.1 Italia, the most important of the Clerical papers, quite definitely takes the side of the Corriere della Sera,  Mussolini&apos;s Popolo df Italia?, representing interventionist1 Socialism, is in full, agreement with the polioy of nationalities, and believes in the good faith of the Jugo-Slavs,    At the same time it regards the Treaty of London as quite reconcilable with the &apos;Patto di Roma1 - the principles accepted at the Congress of Rome.    And this is the position taken up by a number of other papers representing collectively a strong body of opinion - probably the preponderant opinion,A comparison of the numbers and character of the deelarations put out on one side or the other by various associations points to the same conclusion.    Only one takes the extreme position and protests against any modi-fioation of the Treaty of London and this oomes from a Society representing upper class &quot;irredenti1 - the class most closely touched by Slav expansion and most bitterlyhostile to Italo-Slav friendship0   The vDemocrazia4....Social^ irredajita&apos; - of a more popular character - approves the nationalities policy.    The &quot;League of National Defence1 takes the midway position.As regards the political effects of the controversy, it has no doubt strengthened the position of Baron Sonnino in so far as it has shown (1) that Signor Orlando is not
prepared to break with him at present, (2) that the mass of Italian opinion, while sincerely^strongly in favour of an Italo-Slav entente and eo-operation are prepared for some concessions (not Istria nor Triesos nor perhaps Zara) where Italian &amp; Slav territorial claims are in conflict, approves of the exerol.se of a certain oaution in the development of the &apos;Patto-di Roma&apos; polioy and does not desire any revision of the &apos;Patto di Londra&apos; before the end of the v.ar0    At the same time it has now shown that anything more than a not very influential,, though very noisy and insistent minority OX the Italian public approves Baron Sonnino&apos;s sabo^ge^ of the nationalities policy or shares his distrustful and hostile feelings towards the Slavs,    Baron Sonnino seems to have recognised this, if it &quot;be the fast that (as is reported in the Times^of  Sept, 13, the Italian Government at the meeting of the Cabinet on Sept, 8th and 9th, decided to give official recognition to the Jugo-Slav movement for independence &amp; unity &amp;Addendum,The Times of Sept,20th publishes &quot;the precise text of the declaration which the Italian Cabinet on Sect; 9th deoided to make to the Allied Governments,&quot;   It runs:-&quot;The Council of Ministers resolves to inform the Allied Governments that the Italian Government regards the move-ment of the Jugo-Slav peoples for the conquest of their,, independence jand for their ponst3.tut.ion w Lth^   rill State as corresponding to the principles for whioh the Entente is fighting and also to the arms of a just and lasting peace,&quot;There is not much cordiality about this document, no suggestions of Italy placing herself at the head of the movement;   at the same time it is., as the &apos;.Kmesw points out, the first definite declaration of the Italian Government as a whole on the Jugo-Slav question&apos;; and the phrase constitution with. a.free JBtateJ. Is presumably to he regarded as a reoogniticc o$      -w&amp;vlu,-p\^^w%,.
NOTES.(1)   For Example:-    The Italian papers of August 29th published a Zurich telegram giving in resume from the Munohaner Neueste Naohrlohten the programme adopted at the meeting held on August 16th-18th at Laibach,. at which representatives of the Poles, the Czechs, the Slovenes, the Croats of Croatia and of Dalmatia were present.    It ran a3 follows.-Union of the Southern Slav peoples in an independentStatejEquality of the Slav language with other speciallanguages]Protection of national minorities] Safeguarding of Slav interests abroad by means ofParliamentary delegations. La Perseveranza (reproduced by the Giornale d1Italia) sees in this programme, taken in connection with words used by the president of the Congress, Koroseo, - &quot;We must prepare ourselves for the time when we shall be asked ?Tell us exactly what it is that you want1&quot; - a proof that the Southern Slavs were aiming at a federal state under the Habsburg crown.    II 0 or r lore della Sera, II Seoolo, L&apos;Epooa and even L&apos;ldea Nazlonale lnter-pret the evidence in its natural sense as a demand for complete national Independence.    Similarly an expression used by a Polish deputy, Skarbek - &quot;Against the German programme &apos;From the Baltic to BagdadT, the Slavs can set their programme &apos;From Danzig to Trieste&apos; - was interpreted as a definite claim to possession of Trieste.II Rgsto del Carlino of August 28th has an article from Attilio Tamaro, an Irredento, enumerating and describing 15 different political parties amonc; the Jugo-Slavs - all but one being represented as faithful to Austria and hostile to Italy.
The Giornale of Sept. 10th prints in its second column a message from Berne reproduoing from an Agram paper, the Hryatska-Rijec, (which the writer describes as the chief organ of the Serbo-Croat Coalition of Agram) statements representing Mons. Jeglié as an instrument of certain high clerical circles in Vienna and as &apos;making use of the movement for Jugo-Slav unity in order to promote the ends of the Austrian Government.

(2) The papers in question were:

La Perseveranza (of Milan) - An old established paper. Conservative and reactionary  - unimportant.

Il Resto del Carlino (of Bologna) pro-German before the war and of doubtful neutralist tendency since; shares news service with the Giolittian La Stampa. Its former editor, ?, is now editor of

Il Tempo, started early in this year as the organ of the Giolittian-Clerical &apos;Unione Parlamentare&apos;.

Il Mattino (of Naples) - before Italy&apos;s intervention frankly pro-German; &apos;Italia fara da se&apos; attitude; "perhaps the most anti-Greek and anti-Slav of all Italian papers and always finds reason to attack Democrats, France and especially England in these connections. (Short guide to the Foreign Press, Sept. 1917, issued by General Staff, War Office).

La Nazione (of Florence) unimportant; edited by Carlo Scarfoglio, brother of late editor of Il Mattino and of the same tendency. Carlo Scarfoglio was and still is leader-writer of Mattino under pseudonym of &apos;Kim&apos;.
