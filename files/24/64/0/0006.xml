The Committee understand that negotiations have been in progress between the Railway Executive Committee, acting under the directions of the Board of Trade, wnd the p.ail*,raymen!s Unions, and that in the course of these negotiations an offer of 4/- per vreek (making a total war wage advance of 29/- a week) vm&amp; ran.de to the &quot;Unions, was considered at a delegate meeting, and refused.    That thereupon the offer was increased to 5/- (making a total of %/*) radch ttff*$ was also considered by the delegates and refused.    The Committee nave from time to time called the attention of the Uinistry of Labour and of the &quot;^r Cabinet to the difficulty that exists on the part of the arbitration tribunals in dealing ^ith claims for advances of wages referred to them under the Munitions of T*.r Acts v?hen trades not under those Acts are dealt rrith by Go^rnraent Departments and concessions are made (frequently as a. result of a threat of a strike) which nske it appear that more can be obtained as a result of direct pressure upon the Oovernnent Departments tfean is possible if arbitration is resorted to.the policy of &quot;direct action&quot;, if thus encouraged,, is likely to become poyylar, si me the Unions concerned are freed from the necessity of supporttog.their claims by reasoned evidence, and their subsequent actioni if s decision is given against them, is unfettered by the existence of a considered a-&quot;ard (issued by an impartial body) which justifies that decision and enables the public accurately to appraise the merits of the dispute; bargaining by threats is substituted for settlement by reason.3.   When the Committee were, first set \\$ it was understood that it ivould be their duty to deal vdth applications referred to them with a view to adjusting ^ages as far as possible so as reasonably to keep pace rath the abnormal increase in the cost of living, making due allowance for auch sacrifice in standards of living as the m.0 has inevitably imposed on all classes of the community.The methods which have been adopted in handling wa/res questions in the large essential trades wMch stand outside the scope of arbitration are making it increasingly difficult to proceed upon this basis.    It has become clear to the other trades affected that claims based upon arguments of force receive a fuller and prompter recognition than those which are assumed to be supported on economic grounds, which have to pass through the process of arbitration, and which are ultimately dealt rrith upon their merits.     In other ^rords opportunity is afforded for the present national situation to be exploited by certain sections of labour in such a manner as to force terms of remuneration that are not in proportion to the increased cost of lining due to the war. The financial effects of the situation thereby created and the economic difficulties which are likely to result therefrom on tbe termination of the ^ar in the opinion of the Committee oall for the most serious consideration.
4.. The circumstances attendant upon the grant by the. Ilinister of Munitions of a bonus of IZ$ per cent on earnings to large classes of munitions workers are well-known to the War Cabinet,  - * and it is perhaps unnecessary for the Committee on this occasion to reiterate what has &quot;been said from tine to time as to the effect of this grant upon the general wages situation.    No doubi the War Cabinet have fully considered the effects that have follov/ed this grant but effective action does not appear to have been taken to prevent the recurrence of grants of a similar nature.     On the contrary the Government appear to have acquiesced in repetitions which, though less serious 30 far as regards the expenditure involved, are equally disastrous in their general effect on the industrial situation.5.   learly 12 months ago this Coomittee, on an application referred to them by the Kinistry of Labour, issued an award granting an increase up to 20/- per week to certain large classes of railway servants.    Within two or three days of the issue of that award the Railway Executive Committee, under authority from the Board of Trade, granted to other classes of railway servants an increase up to 21/- per week.    This placed the Committee on Production in a position of the greatest difficulty.    The comparison made by the men who obtained an award of 20/- between their position under arbitration and the position of those who did not go to arbitration will be obvious.    The Committee drew the attention of the War Cabinet to this case at the time, but they have not received up to the present any indication as to what action was taken as a result of the representations then made.    In April of this year, as a result of further negotiations, ugain untfaa? the authority of the Boarcrer Traae, the war wajpr-advance to the railwaymen was increased to 25/- per week; this i-igure set a standard which the Comnittee on Production followed (and it will be obvious that they could do nothing else) in the case of other trades.6.   In the meantime the wage3 of coalniners, again under the authority of the Board of Trade, have also been dealt with by the Department concerned in direct negotiation with the Trade Unions, coupled with threats of stoppages of work, and in September, 1917, an advance of eighteen pence per day was made to the members of the Kiners&apos; Federation.     This grant was regarded at that time as an indication of the fact that the Government were not opposed to further large increases in the national wages bill and at the subsequent general hearing in connection with the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades it was impossible for the Committee on Production to decide the claims upon merits in as much as it was clear to the Unions connected with those trades (which it iaay be remarked are under the compulsory arbitration provisions of the Munitions of War Acts) that the Government were not prepared to oppose large increases in wages, and that (in the absence of the opposition from the Employers) it was only the arbitration tribunal who presumed to consider the serious national effect of the grant of large additions to y/ages or to go into the question whether altered conditions in the cost of living justified further increases in wages and, if so, to what extent.    Again in June of this year a further claim by the Hiners was put forward, and again it was dealt with by negotiation, coupled with a threat to cease work, and a further advance of eighteen pence a day was conceded.
i k i j7.   Prior to the concession, the negotiations had reached a stage which made it practically impossible for any course to be titan which would, retrieve the situation.    The Committee on Production &quot;rere not consulted in any way as to the proposals until the matter had reached a crisis, when the Committee were asked in an indirect manner what would be the effect upon other trades of the concession of a further eighteen pence per day to the miners. In the circumstances then existing, the only reply which the Committee could make was to state that if the miners received the concession it would be impossible for the Committee to refuse to give a further advance in the Engineering and Shipbuilding trades&quot;, at the hearings which were then taking place, and that in settling the amount to be given to the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades the minds of the Committee would necessarily be influenced by the amount that was conceded to the miners.8.   The Committee submit that the time has come when the War Cabinet should consider the whole wages position, and should agree that negotiations in regard to claims for increases in wages shouldnnot be conducted Departmentally (unless the claim falls clearly within, and can be settled &quot;rithin, the terms of the general arrards already issued by this Committee), and that any claims which taaA to go beyond those general limits should be dealt with not by negotiation but by reference to arbitration.     It cannot any longer be ejected that the trades which are under the Hunitions of ^ar Acts and are therefore compelled to submit to arbitration will continue in that position when they see that bodies of men, such as the miners and the railway servants, beine free from the obligation to resort to arbitration, are able to get better terms by direct pressure unon the Government, and unless steps are taken to deal with the position, not only will the situation of the arbitration tribunals be made one of extreme difficulty, but the trades under the Hunitions of War Acts will certainly ask that , they also may be free from the provisions of the Act.9,   Prior to the unfortunate grant of the IZi per cent bonus the Committee on Production had succeeded in establishing, by means of a series of voluntary agreements under which &quot;ages in almost all of the principal munitions trades l,vere reviewed automatically three times a year, a recognised level of wages advances and an accepted procedure for the readjustment of wages according to changes in cost of living.    This procedure had been welcomed by both employers and workmen&apos;s representatives and it had behind it a large body of opinion.    The scheme was commenced in the Sngineering trades and it has now been extended to shipbuilding, e:cplosives, chemicals, building and a number of other large trades.    The Committee would point out that irregular advances given at odd intervals to large bodies of men such as the miners and railway servants are bound to upset the other trades avid to give rise to unrest and impatience when those trades see some other trade placed in a position temporarily more favourable.    TSaoh advance to one trade is used as a lever to obtain advances in other trades and each trade in turn sees some other that has advanced beyond its own level.     It will be obvious that, apart from the-unsettling effects of   onch a condition of affairs, there in a steadily growing increase in nublie expenditure, without any sort of guarantee that suck increase is warranted by changes in the cost of living;   this is a matter to which the Select Committee on Public Expenditure have called explicit attention.
10.   The Committee submit that in the interests of industrial harmony as ,,rell an on grounds cf general public policy, all wages changes should be placed in the hands of some one authority no that the whole o-p the trades can be dealt with on uniform linen and as far as practicable at similar intervals of time.    Once it is established that all trades can submit their claims for increases of wages periodically the need for unrest and strikes will cease. It is believed that public opinion would support the Government against any sin/rle body of men who attempted to exploit the necessities of the time, if it were clearly and publicly stated that a recognised method of reviewing all wages neriodically had been set up and was available, without delay, to decide the case of each and every trade.11.   The Committee recommend therefore;-(l) that effective action should be taken without delay to ensure a cessation of the present practice whereby concessions are made to trades not under the arbitration provisions of the Kunitions of War Acts, which concessions not only force the hands of the arbitration tribunals in dealing with the trades that are under the Acts but engender unrest and dissatisfaction among those trades until they are granted equal treatment.    The settlement of wages in the trades dealt with by arbitration under the Hunitions of War Acts should psecede, not follow, settlements in other trades;(2) that steps should at once be taken to extend over the widest possible area the principle of the periodical review of &quot;rages in all trades at or about the same time and by one authority, constituted in such manner as to command the confidence of employers and workpeople as well as to ensure, through persons experienced in the leading industries, a fair and just consideration of the whole position as determined from time to time by changes in the cost of lining and the abnormal conditions brought about by the war.IS.   In conveying to the Trade Unions and to the public generally the decision at which the Government have arrived the Committee suggest that the following points should be included(l) That it is. the view of the Government that the general &apos;  principle which should regulate changes in wages during the war in all industries should be the grant from time to time at regular intervals of such further increases as may be necessary to enable workpeople to meet a reasonable proportion of the ascertained increase in the cost of living.(2) That, having regard to the unrest and dissatisfaction which exist as a result of some trades being at liberty to obtain advances of wages at irregular intervals, the principle now laid down should be applied to all trades, including those not under the Hunitions of War Acts, and that,  -having regard to the opportunity thus afforded of periodical adjustments, no general changes in wages will be agreed to or sanctioned by the Government unlessthose
those changes are arrived at under this procedure or are in conformity (&quot;both as regards approximate amount and time) with the general changes established by such procedure.(3) That the central authority referred to in paragraph 11 (2) above shall deal with, all proposals for general changes in wages in all industries and that Government Departments responsible for control of industries shall not enter into negotiations respecting general changes in wages unless the claims in question fall within the limits established by the central wages authority in its decisions for the trades already dea&quot;it with.     A . Department responsible for any negotiations of this nature shall at each stage consult with the Ministry of Labour and, through that Ministry, with the central wages authority.The Committee think-also that opportunity should be taken to make public the facts with regard to advances of wages already granted in the principal trades, with information as to the additional national expenditure thus involved.DAVID HARREL WILLIAM W.MACK2SJZIE rrALWORTH H.B0BERTS J3.C .K.G0IOTP.
