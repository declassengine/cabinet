413 I?I desire to direct the attention of the War Cabinet to theincreased prices of the necessaries of life, and to the necessity of considering whether any portion of this increase should be borne by an extension of the system of State subsidies already applied to broiid.class of commodity which is not under rigid official control is still in full operation.   But the necessity for an increase in the price of foodstuffs which are absolutely controlled has become apparent, notably in the case of meat, milk,margarine, butter, and choose.   And it is particularly in connection with the increased price of meat that I as anxious to obtain a decision.5,       In the month of July last I informed the Consumers1 Council that an increase In the price of meat was required in order to cover the Increased cost of imported meat from North America and to defray the expenses of distribution 7(hich had up to that time been borne by the Ministry of Pood.   Tho view was expressed that the rise in price should be made to coincide with an improvement in quality, and I agreed to postpone any increase until the present month when It was expected that we should become mainly dependent upon home-grown meat. 4*        At a meeting of the Consumers1 Council on August 28, Mr. Hyndman moved the following resolution:-&quot;That this Council strongly protests against any rise in the price of moat at the presont time, and suggests that the Treasury should bear the cost of maintaining the existing price of moat for the ooming twelve months, instead of putting an extra twopence a pound on the price of meat to the consiamor&quot;,In favour of the resolution it was - urged that the general pressure of prices and shortage of necessaries, especially of coal and milk, would produce a serious state of things in the coming winter; and that, if prices rose, wages would be forcedIt is obvious that tho rising tendency of almost everyup/
up again in still- greater proportion, so that the loss to the Treasury &quot;would be greater, apart from the general disturbance created.Tv;o of the Co-operative members supported the resolution, whereupon I asked If it was to bo understood that Co-operators generally wore in favour of subsidies.   The answer was that these members merely expressed their personal views.After somo discussion the resolution was carried by 10 votes to 6.A similar resolution was carried by a majority at the recent Trades Union Congress at Derby.It Is reasonably clear that tho case of meat cannot be considered separately from the oases of other foodstuffs, and that no dividing line can be drawn between these and other necessaries of life, such as textiles and coal.   It Is, however, possible, and, I think, desirable to treat all these on a different basis from bread, since a cheap and plentiful supply of bread has always been regarded as essential.It is, no doubt, inevitable that any appreciable rice In prices win form the occasion for increased wage claims, and will, moreover, Justify these claims being conceded In manycases.   It must, however, be borne in mind that the wages of, probably, two-thirds of the workers have already advanced to an extent moro than commensurate with any impending or probable increase In the cost of food.   So far as the very poor are concerned something has been done by tho establishment of national kitchens and restaurants to help them to tide over what must inevitably prove to be a trying winter, and it is hoped to secure improved facilities in this respect.   These facilities however can reach only a small minority of poor people eThe burden on the Exchequer of the Broad Sudsidy in the coming financial year will amount to fifty millions, and if the policy of subsidy is to be extended to otheressential/
essential foodstuffs, this burden will at least be doubled.Even this expenditure might be Justified if it werelikely materially to diminish the risk of labour disputes.But the strike tendency would not be allayed by subsidies,and wage demands would be continued upon other grounds.At the same time the possibility of stabilising labourconditions by checking effectively increases in the costof living is one which deserves consideration.   I suggestthat the War Cabinet should authorise one of their members withto consult/a representative of the Treasury, the Minister of Labour, and myself, and consider whether any scheme can be framed for securing by an extension of subsidies a greater measure of Industrial peace.MIHiSTRY OF POOD,&apos;   iHh September 1918.J. R. CLYNES.
