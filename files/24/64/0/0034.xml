wCtoJl fit i * - -This document is .the property of Hi3 Britannic Majjssj^yJ^ Govt..,tilljuil . I 01WAR   CABINET.TliE Q.UESTI0H,OI^IRELAHD^ Memo &quot;by Mr, G. ff. Barnes.I feel very uneasy .r&apos;bout the question of Home Rule andConscription in Ireland,     I addressed n memo to my colleagueson the 19th, July, (G. T. 5199 ) on the question as it then. thennppe^red to my mind.     I pointed out/that there had been nn improvement in the political atmosphere in Ireland, and that the time had. come, I thought, for making another attempt at settling the question of Home Rule in view of the possibility of voluntary recruiting not being satisfactory when the term expired for the production of the 50,000 men.     I don&apos;t know how recruiting is goJhg now, although I have haard that there has been some improvement.     But we shall be faced with the need for coming to a decision probably next month, and for my part I cannot see that there is any more chance of carrying conscription then, than there was in April List.     I am pledged by my speech in the House of Commons, and ^lso to the Cabinet before that, to Home Rule preceding Conscription.   I would much like if another attempt could be made to settle the Home Rule question, so that we could with a good grace then apply conscription if necessary.   It seems to me that the two measures are reafc war necessities.   I am told that the Hational-ists would be satisfied with a good deal less than they had in -their minds a few months ago, and if that be so, the settlement would probably be much easier than it was at that time.   At all events, I think an effort should be made to adjust things.(Initialled)   G.   IT.   B.2,Whitehall Gardens,S.W.120th,September 1918,
