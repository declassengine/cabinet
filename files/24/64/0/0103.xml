&apos;ocument Is the Property of1 it i f$&apos;t a J e st y&apos;s Qo Wnme i sit.0H11? (0 f 0RAILWAYM/S STRIKE,&apos;   BOARD OP TRAL8B Bulletin No.7. Thursday 26th Sept.1916. 5. p*m.During the day there has been a considerable improvement Practically the whole of South Wales are back at work.   At Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester nearly all the men are back at work, and at Crewe and Preston all have returned.    The only serious point in the position is London and here the locomotive men at Willesden (L &amp;  N.W.Railway) and Old Oak (G,W.Railway) are coming in.      Locomotive men at Bow (North London) and on the Great Eastern are still out but another meeting is to he held at Bow to-night.      The men at Nine Elms on the London &amp; South Western have refused to come back unless their demands are completely complied with, but it is thought that they will prohably come in either to-night or to-morrow morning.    A rather serious master is that       the men at Eastleigh on the London &amp; South Western have now refused to work ambulance trains.At a meeting of the Committee set up by the War Cabinet this afternoon the questions were discussed of the issuing of a notice cancelling exemption certificates in the case of all men who have not returned to work by a certain date, and of stopping the leave of the troops from France, but it was thought that in view of the general improvement of the situation steps of this character were not necessary to-day and further con-side rat ion was deferred till to-morrow.
