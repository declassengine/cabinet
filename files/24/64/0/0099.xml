f JThis Polpcjelrl   the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!-I    j&apos;       \,   /--- 1---2S3I?^ ji Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   September 1918.SECRET.SUPPLIES TO tfHE UNITED STATES ARMIES.THE United States in response to oar appeals are sending men to Europe far in advance of their general munitions programme. Their shell programme is hopelessly in arrear. Their gun programme is even worse. Not only in the main staples of equipment, but in a very large number of minor supplies, they will find themselves very largely deficient. Unless, therefore, the arsenals of Great Britain and France can supply these deficiencies, the Americans cannot be expected to continue pouring in men, and the armies available for 1919 must be proportionately reduced. On the other hand, there is reason to believe that, working together, the French and British munition works can supply fully the needs of all the United States troops which can be brought by our maximum carrying capacity to Europe, and can supply them with good weapons and ample ammunition, provided only that the necessary raw materials are sent by America to be made up in our factories. No undue strain will be imposed upon our munition factories. The gun plants and the shell plants are runuing so smoothly now that, given raw material,they can easily meet their share of American needs. The processes of dilution and of releases of men will continue, in spite of this extra work, at a moderate rate. I am, therefore, pursuing the policy of doing everything possible to equip the United States armies, and offering every assistance in my power. I have agreed to supply them with more than 2,000 guns in 1919, and to make the ammunition for all these guns if they will send the raw materials. By this deal alone, considerably more than one hundred millions of British indebtedness to America will be extinguished. It seems to me indispensable that this process, to which we are deeply committed, should continue.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.September 25, 1918.
