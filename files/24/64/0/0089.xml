(1)In accordance with War Cabinet No. 476, Hinute 9, the Committee proceeded to discuss the best methods of carrying out the decisions of the War Cabinet as laid down in the above mentioned Minute, which were as follows ;**(a) The Government resist the strike and that no further concessions be discussed.(b) The personnel of the Royal Navy, Army, and Royal Air Force, should be drawn on for the maintenance of essential traffic and for the protection of buildings, material, and the personnel remaining at work i(e) Picketing should be stopped, and that the Homo Secretary should consider the question of the power under which this is to be effected:(6) The president of the Board of Trade should take steps to put an embargo on the funds of the Unions concerned;(e) The president of the Board of Trade should do his utmost to bring public opinion on the side of the Government.   To this end he should maintain close touch with the press throughout the strike, and should acquaint them with the nature of the action decided upon by the War Cabinet.   In particular, he should cause it to be known throughout the country in that day&apos;s evening papers that the Government hod decided to resist the strike, and that the /* fighting forces would be used for the purpose mentioned in (b);( ) A Committee should be formed, with the following composition;&quot;The president of the Board of Trade.(Chairman) Representatives of the Admiralty, Representatives of the War Office, Representatives of the Air Department, Representatives of the Home Office, Representatives of the Ministry ofLabour,,Representatives of the Ministry of &quot; &apos; .  National Servioe*to remain in session during the strike, for the purpose of co-ordinating the activities of the various Departments in carrying out the above decisions, and generally in dealing with the strike.
i, SIR HBJRBBBI WALKER explained shortly tne general sitaatj and said that all the locomotive men on the G.W.R. in South Wales were out, with dome small exceptions. Bristol was clos altogether, no trains going in or out, and there were sections of locomotive men out at leading, Oxford, Birmingham, Chester and Plymouth. It could he said that the Strike was confined 1 at present to the G.W.R., hut that there were local troubles 1 on the 3MV.R., and 1T.I/.R. The Strike was undoubtedly spread! a little hut in some places the men were coming hack by twos J threes. Information had just been reesbved that no decision;! been arrived at at Newport, where .:r, Thomas had held a Heetinj that morning, but another Meeting was to be held during the afternoon, and the decision to hold a further Meeting could &quot;beI considered as favourable news. . 1I2.     SIR iSRBSRT WALK3R said that given military protection hej did not consider that tnere would be any difficulty in running! ambulance trains, trains containing food-stuffs, troop trains;,I or trains for munitions urgently required at the Front.     It jj might, however, be impossible to find trains to carry workers j to Munition   orks and it was very essential that, at any rate, a certain proportion of the local services should be maintains for bringing business men and women to their work.     Sir Herbe suggested tnat the 0. in 0. of the Home Forces should be in constant communication with nim in order to afford protection at the most effective points, to protect railway property, and to safeguard men willing to work,TK5 0.111 C. OF TIES HQEu FORCES said that there were only three battalions in the vicinity of South  ales.    The number which would be available depended on &quot;whether Colonial troops could be used.    Without interfering with ports, and it would be impossible to denude the eastern coast, there would be aboi; 50,000 infantry available, including Colonials, wnich numbered approximately one half.     There were 2,000 at Oswestry which would be required for that district and the remainder would as to come from Salisbury Plain, Aldersnot, Wimbledon, Norfolk, Suffolk and Kent.It was suggested tnat the Admiralty should assist the Am by providing sailors and. marines, tne use of whom would have an undoubted effect, particularly in South &quot;Wales, and Admiral Heath agreed, on behalf of the Admiralty, to take all steps possible.    It was also suggested that volunteers who snould n be called out but should come out voluntarily?Jshould be made us of.    The Committee decided&apos;tnat :w &apos;(a) Sir Herbert r-&apos;alker should immediately place himself in communication with the C. in C. of the :-:ome Forces, and tne Second Sea Lord, in order that arrange-ments should be made for the use of the Naval and Military forces for the protec-tion of railway property and the safe-guarding of men willing to work.(b) Tnat Colonial troops should not be used for this purpose without tne autnority, of the Var Cabinet.
of 3.     BRIGADIER GENERAL MANCE said that at Borden there e   were, at present, 105 Engine Drivers, 450 Firemen,68 Guards, 25 Shunters and 70 Signalmen serving, but if it wore necessary arrangements could be made to bring back railwaymen from Prance.The Committee decided    that4*. toe Second Sea Lord, Brigadier General Manoe and tho Chief of the Air- Staff should ascertain and inform Sir Herbert Walker of tho number&quot;of railwayman available to work the Railways at present stationed In the United Kingdom.4.   SIR HERBERT -WALKHR said that it was most necess--ary that peaceful picketing should be stopped, and quoted Instances of men being persuaded to come out by the pickets that day who were willing to carry on their work,THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out that peaceful picketing was the lew of the land under the Trades Disputes Act but that regulation No. 42 of the Defence of the Realm Act was, in his opinion, suffioiont to deal with this question.     This regulation made liable to prosecution anyone impeding the production repair or transfer of war material or any other work necessary for the prosecu-tion-of the war.    It could therefore be said that peaceful picketing come under this heading, and anyone impeding a man going to work cu caking him away from his work by this method could be prosecuted.   At the same time under this regulation it would only be possible for the Hi lit ary Forces to keep the picket /* ,away from the railway buildings, and Sir George Cave thought that the Police would have to deal with them in the streets, and if necessary arrest them.GENERAL GUILDS pointed out that it was no good prosecut-ing after the damage done by peaceful picketing had been caused and said that it was moat necessary to protect men going to and .from work.alsoHe pointed out/that tho Cabinet had agreed that all this picketing should be dona away with.SIR WILLIAM ROBERTSON urged that the soldiers could do nothing under tho Government1s regulations unless they were asked by the requisite civil authority and pointed out the difficult situation in which the soldiers might find themselves when guarding railway buildings and the strikers refusing to oocy their orders *GENERAL MACREADY alluded to the Strike in 1911 and said that where no local police were available soldiers were used and very little trouble was caused.   In fact in previous days when the Military were called in the soldier took command and the police were at their disposal.THE ADJUTANT GENERAL urged strongly that more effective stops should be taken and agreed that prosecution, without arrest, would be no good.
The Committee decided that&apos;(a) The Home secretary should immediately issue notices to all districts, calling attention to the fact that picketing even jf peaceful was illegal under Section 4S of the Defence Of the Realm Act, and that offenders were liable to arrest.(b) That the Home &apos;8ecrotary should address a general requisition to the War Office anddmiralty asking for aid to the Civil Sowerand at once authorise ail Chief Constables to immediately call on the assistance of the military forces of the Crown.(o) That the Home Secretary should issue immediate instructions to Chief Constables to give every protection to the Railway Companies and the men in their employ,(d) That if the above stops for stoppingpicketing were not sufficient the Committee should meet again in order to consider what further steps should be taken0Trade Union   5/ SIR ALBERT STANLEY pointed out that it was most VundSv undesirable that the Trade Union Funds should be used toassist the strikers; and it was agreed that an injunction could be asked for in order to prevent this being done.SIM DAVID SHACKLETOI said that he was very anxious that no act: on should be taken in the matter of getting ar; in j a not.i or. before Mr. Thomas, Mr, Bromley and other leaders of tne Railway b&apos;nion, had been consulted.   He pointed out thai, these leaders said that the strike was illegal and therefore would not pay any strike pay.   They might conse-quently think it an attack on their Societies if an injuno-tion was , taken without their consents,Tho C ommi11 e e decided tha t:-- No injunction to stop payment from Trade Union Funds to the strikers should be asked for in the Lav Oourts until after con^ suit a t i o n wi th the leaders o f th o Unions concerned.Oancella-     6- MAJOR LLOYD-GREAME said that the protection certi-tion of     ficates held by Railwaymen being merely administrative Protec-     protection could be cancelled at any time.   Men holding tion such certificates could be called up on a seven days*3ertifi- notice, i.e. to report for service on the eighth day* In Jates.       the case of men not medically examined, the notice wouldbe a double notice, i.e. to report for medical examination forthwith and to report for service on the eighth day. This would comply with Tribunal regulations.   The Coventry arrangements could be followed mutatis mutandis.SIR GEORGE CAVE said that the Homes Offioe would do ^a$r ever could bo done; that a letter would be sent by the Home Office requesting, the assistance of the Military; that he would communicate with the chief Constables that night and give them authority to call for military assistance, and would also issue a notice calling attention to Section 42 ef the Defence of the Realm Act.
SIR HERBERT WALKER said that the railway protec-tion certificates could easily he withdrawn hut there were agreements with the Trade Unions principally with regard to the calling up of the youngest men first, whioh could hardly he ignored.SIR DAVID SHACKLETON agreed with this view and said that whereas Coventry was not a trade dispute this particular strike was, and the calling up of the men would break many Parliamentary pledges.     A very big question was involved in this for it practically meant that if the decision was taken to cancel&apos; protection certificates in this&apos;case similar procedure could be followed in any dispute in which the State or the Committee of Production were involved with the men,MAJOR LLOYD GRSAME pointed out that the Coventry oase had involved over-riding the schedule of Protect-ed Occupations,, which in the case of munitions was the equivalent of the arrangements to which Sir Herbert Walker had referred,.     The principle which the War Cabinet had adopted in authorising calling up in the Coventry case was that there was a clear distinction between a challenge to the State and an ordinary trade, dispute.     The present case appeared to be clearly the former.THE COMMITTEE decided that        -No action should be taken at the present to cancel exemption certificates of railwaymen on strike.Time when ?,     With reference to the decisions arrived atdecisions for the employment of the Naval and Military forces-:arrived,at SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that the position mightshould take        possibly alter so much within the next few hours, and effect. there might be so much improvement that not only wasit possible that the Naval and Military forces would not be necessary but that their -employment might impede a settlement.     He suggested therefore that no movement should be made by the Naval and Military Authorities until a certain time that evening, and asked the Co in 0. of the Home 1&apos;orces at what hour the men would be ready to move..SIR WILLIAM ROBERTSON said that he would be ready by 8 o&apos;clock that evening to send out the necessary orders, and after that time the movement of troopj to the positions arranged with Sir Herbert Walker, would be proceeding..THE COIUIiTTEE decided that:--If the President of tho Board of Trade had not communicated with the C, in Cv of the Home Forces to tho effect that the Naval and Military forces wore not required by 8 &apos;p..m. that night the arrangements made by tho decisions of tho Committee with regard to the employment of the Armed Forces of the Crown were to be carried out forthwith.
