[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government j -Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1918.ySECRET.G.T.-5721. ^    12THE LABOUR SITUATION. ,Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 18th September, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The demand of the railway men is discussed, and the proposed amalgamation in the engineering industry is reported.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on foreign affairs, with special reference to Russia, the Internationale, and India; on home affairs, with special reference to the Trades Union Congress, to industrial unrest, and to the cotton strike ; and on matters connected with food, is described.Part III: District Reports.Generally, unrest is more prevalent, demands for increases in wages leading to disputes in many districts. Revival of unrest is most marked in the West Midlands and on the Clyde.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The most serious strikes are those at the Mill Close Lead Mine, which threatens to bring out all the Derbyshire miners, the strike of the Lancashire cotton spinners, and that of the Liverpool coalheavers, which has now been settled.(6.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. The most important disputes are those among tradesmen on repair work in the Clyde district, who refuse to work overtime, and one among the garment workers in London on a demand for a standard rate of 51. a week for cutters.I. -Geneeal Remarks.The Demand of the Railwaymen.The past week has seen a rapid development of the dispute between the National Union of Railwaymen and the Railway Executive Committee on the subject of increased wages. On Friday last the offer by the Railway Executive Committee of an advance of 5s. to those who are 18 years of age or over and 2s. 6d. to all under 18 was refused by the delegate meeting of the N.U.&amp;., and negotiations were transferred to the Government. Conferences at the Board of Trade have taken place since, but settlement has not yet been reached. The demand of the N.U.R. is for an increase of 10s. per week for all workers, male and female, over 18 years of age and 5s. for those under that age. The advances hitherto given amount to 25s. per week for men. Women have received half this amount as bonus.The recent history of advances to railwaymen starts from the agreement of November 1917, according to which advances were raised to 21s. above pre-war rates, and no change was to take place until March 1918. They were then to be subject to revision only in the case of considerable alteration in the cost of living. In March it was admitted that no such considerable alteration had occurred, but in April 1918 the railwaymen made a demand on the ground of the 12^ per cent., and received an additional 4s. a-week, raising the advance from 21s. to 25s.   Since then, in the month[1100-47] B
of July, the Committee on Production, has granted an advance of 3s. 6dL per week to the engineering trades, and it is doubtless on the strength of this advance that the railwaymen again pressed their claim for consideration. The 3s. 6d. advance in the engineering trades carries with it 12  per cent, bonus, and possibly on this basis the original offer of the Railway Executive Committee was one of 4s., since raised to 5s.A factor which must be taken into account, since it will appeal to the men, is the relation between the advances granted to railwaymen and those to other large groups. A comparison between the advances secured by the members of the N.U.R. with those of the A.S.E. is complicated by the fact of the 12  per cent, bonus on earnings in the engineering industry. Time workers belonging to the A.S.E. have secured an advance of 23s. 6d. war wage, together with the 12-1 per cent, bonus on total earnings generally. In certain districts there have also been sectional advances amounting to Is. or 2s., which were not given as war wages, and may for purposes of comparison be omitted. As the 4s. advance to the N.TJ.K. in April was intended to repre-sentthe 12^ per cent, advance in the engineering trades, their other advances, amounting to 21s., compared with an advance to the A.S.E. of 23s. 6d. Comparison with the advances to the miners is difficult for the reason that during the first three years of the war advances to miners were percentage advances, which raised their wages by 30 to 50 per cent, on different basis rates in the various fields. The last two advances have been flat rate sums totalling 3s. per day. Compared with the operatives in the cotton trade, and probably in most trades outside those very directly connected with the war, the railwaymen have secured favourable terms. Cotton operatives have obtained advances totalling only 60 per cent, on their standard rates, which were 5 per cent, less than the actual rates obtaining immediately before the war.There thus seems to be little question but that the offer of 5s., if accepted, would have placed the railwaymen in approximately as favourable a wage pogition as members of the other industries noted. There are, however, other considerations which affect the case. In addition to the argument deduced from the rise in the cost of living during the war, and that based on a comparison of advances with advances drawn by workmen in other trades, a general impression exists that the railway companies while under Government control have succeeded in amassing large sums as excess profits. The reasons for this belief are first, the fact that Government traffic has increased enormously owing to war conditions, and second, that passenger fares have been generally increased by 50 per cent. Under the agreement, however, under which the railways were taken over, the net profits are absolutely fixed. They are calculated on the basis of the profits made in the year 1913, any decrease being made good to the companies and any excess going to the State. If the companies have decided that, on the basis of these profits, they were justified in increasing their dividends, it is beside the point. The fact remains that the companies, which represent the shareholders, do not obtain any excess profits due to war conditions. A subsidiary argument can doubtless be adduced that, even admitting these facts, it is not fair that the railwaymen should be penalised for the benefit of the State; if the extra profits which should come to the companies owing to Government traffic during the war are credited to the State, this amounts to a disguised form of taxation, which, owing to the fact that wages are thereby prevented from rising, is actually paid in part by the railwaymen. The same argument, however, would apply with equal force to the 80 per cent, of excess profits in other industries, which are at present taken by the State under the Finance Act as Excess Profits Duty.An additional argument used by the railwaymen in pressing for an advance is based on facts entirely unconnected with the war. They state that at the time of the outbreak of war they were agitating for an increase of rates on the ground that the profits of the year 1913 showed an important advance on the average profits of the previous four years. Their agitation, of which they claim that the success could not have been doubtful, was abruptly terminated by the outbreak of war. They consider that the facts by which it was justified should now be taken into consideration, and an advance granted, entirely apart from those due to special war conditions.Such are the arguments, besides that based on the rise of the cost of living, which, whether the leaders refer to them or not, may be expected to weigh with the rank and file of the railwaymen. The question arises on what principle, from the point of view of Labour administration generally, should the claim be decided. An attempt to determine such a principle from past experience affords an example of the fact that a consistent principle in wages control is not easy to unravel. As has been seen, it is difficult or impossible to arrive at a comparison of the precise effects of the various
advances in different industries. The principle, which has apparently been followed in many cases hitherto, has been to grant to time-workers a flat advance equal in amount to the percentage increase on. the pre-war rate of the unskilled or less highly-paid man, corresponding to the increase in the cost of living. Presumably this method has been adopted on the supposition that all the income of such a man, though not that of the more highly-paid man, is spent on necessaries. Such a principle, however, has not been consistently followed ; in the circumstances this has been practically impossible, and every departure from it hitherto forms a precedent for a departure in this case.Another defect of this state of affairs emerges. There can. be no question but that success on the part of the railwaymen will lead to similar demands in other directions, and that, basing their argument on the advance granted to the N.U.R., other unions will claim for similar treatment. The history of wagw movements during the war has established the desirability of unity of principle to deal with these demands, if that course be possible. Until some such procedure is introduced, sectional claims for advances are liable to be decided on principles, which may perhaps seem applicable to the individual case, but which will encourage demands in other quarters in which those principles do not apply.Proposed Amalgamation in the. Engineering Industry.A number of trade unions in the engineering industry are at present negotiating with a view to closer amalgamation. They number twenty-six and include the A.S.E.. the Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders, several Brass and Metal Workers&apos; Unions, the Society of Amalgamated Tool Makers, the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society, and the Electrical Trades Union.The scheme has been under consideration by a sub-committee since December 1917. Complete amalgamation rather than closer union was favoured, and definite proposals to this end have been put forward and have been ratified by a vote of the members.A conference was arranged and was held at York from the 11th to the 13th September, which was attended by delegates representing 13 unions and more than 500,000 members. . These delegates unanimously approved the principles of amalga-mation recommended, and appointed a committee to draw up a definite scheme.If, as is anticipated, the amalgamation succeeds, it would include nearly 600,000 members, and thus be the most powerful union of skilled craftsmen in the United Kingdom.II. Press Commei\ts.(A,) Foreign Affairs. &apos;Russia.The death of Captain Cromie is referred to by both the &quot; Herald &quot; and &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; but their regrets are lukewarm compared with their recent comments on other political assassinations in Russia. The &quot;Herald&quot; sees in the murder the natural result cf the autocratic tradition in Russia, while the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; ascribes it to the intrigues of the diplomatic agents of the Allies. In the view of the &quot;Herald&quot; the British ultimatum virtually declares the Bolsheviks outlaws, and the anti-revolutionary war has begun. In the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; Mr. Finch sets out to explain Japanese interference with Russia as due to economic causes, and&apos; in particular her desire to obtain iron and coal. Mr. Hyndman in an article in &quot; Justice&quot; on the Allied policy in Russia blames the British War Cabinet and Foreign Office for failing to make up their mind about Russia. The choice lies between autocracy and a democratic Federal Republic. A Prussian autocracy would inevitably be pro-German. A plain statement of British policy is urgently needed.The Internationale. /A good deal of attention is still given to the prospects of an international conference, though a note of uncertainty begins to sound. The &quot; Herald&quot; is perhaps freest from doubt. It considers that the compromise resolution passed at the Trades Union Congress was a distinct advance on previous resolutions. On one point, however, the resolution is criticised, as it is impossible to expect that Germany would evacuate Belgium and France before negotiations begin.   Labour must now insist on a clear
statement of war aims. Mr. Snowden in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; regrets that a compromise on this question was accepted, and would have preferred a clear verdict on one side or the other. 1Miss Pankhurst in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; laments that the resolution makes no direct mention at all of an international meeting of the workers, but merely asks for adequate labour representation when a peace conference is summoned. As usual&quot; Justice &quot; is strongly opposed to negotiations. Nothing definite has been received from the German Majority Social Democratic Party, which is by far the most important in the central European alliance. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; quotes Mr. T. Shaw&apos;s sarcasm at the congress, &quot; You can get peace by negotiation.   Russia and Bulgaria have got it.&quot;India.The abstract of Mrs. Besanfs review of the Indian Report, which is completed in the &quot;Herald,&quot; ridicules the idea of India waiting for ten years for a commission to decide how far India has reached the level of provincial autonomy. The scheme as a whole is condemned and the proposals are described as impossible. Mrs. Besant makes two proposals to lessen the harm anticipated from some of the worst points. One of these is the institution of a standing parliamentary committee to decide disputes arising between various authorities in India. The other is to decide on the subjects which are to be transferred to popular control by appointing a commission in which progressive Indians are,in a majority or at any, rate well represented. A leading article in &quot;Forward&quot; finds the general lines of the scheme satisfactory, but presses for fewer restrictions and greater trust in the people.Ireland.An attempt is made by the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; to revive interest in the Irish * situation. An article by Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington discusses Irish influence in the United States. She believes that President Wilson is much preoccupied with the Irish question. He favours a settlement by Referendum, because his party the Democrats has always been supported by the Irish, and because an Irish settlement touches the vital question of America&apos;s war aims and Americas good faith.Mr. Snowden thinks the question will soon come to the front owing to the failure of the recruiting campaign, and the danger of conflict with Ulster over the et ention of arms.(B.)--Home Affairs.Congress.Criticisms on the Trades Union Congress proceedings and resolutions are rather varied.Mr. Lansbury in the &quot; Herald &quot; attempts a justification of the block vote system. Mr. Wilson, while condemning the block vote, was content to accept it in his own election to the parliamentary committee. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks the resolution on peace negotiations which is discussed above under &quot; Foreign Affairs,&quot; the most important matter dealt with. Mr. Snowden urges that if trade unions, which have a voting strength in Labour Party Conferences proportionate to their numbers, are unable to control its policy they are themselves responsible. In the &quot; Clarion&quot; Mr. Thompson repeats his assertion that the actual workers support Mr. Havelock Wilson&apos;s revolt, and it thinks his resolutions were the most important feature at the Congress. In the &quot; Call&quot; the Congress is described as dull throughout, except the Presidents address. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; finds in Mr. Ogden&apos;s speech the influence of revolutionary thought which is growing among the rank and file ; while Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot;Forward,&quot; declares that the attitude of the younger men was a forewarning of a revolution in the labour spirit.Industrial Unrest.The increasing unrest in the industrial world attracts the notice of almost every paper. The &quot; Herald &quot; sneers at Labour men who are occupying offices at high salary. Higher pay is needed for the workers who make such big sums possible. Labour should claim from the Government Industrial Councils, chosen by Labour, to deal with wages and conditions of labour. Soldiers and sailors must have the same rights of citizenship as those in civilian life, and all industry necessary for the well-being of the nation
should at once be nationalised in order to abolish profiteering. On the question of recent strikes it challenges Mr. Appleton&apos;s remarks in the report of the General Federation of Trade Unions. There is no hidden hand, or German gold, or Bolshevik conspiracy behind these movements. From the general industrial ferment the &quot; Call&quot; argues that the class truce is breaking down, and it adds that as the truce ceases support for the war must go also.Honesty, sincerity, and promptness are the &quot; New Statemans&quot; panaceas, to be followed by strict adherence to undertakings agreed on.   -Cotton Strike.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times&quot; regrets that the spinners have rejected the decision of the Central Board, while it thinks provision should be made to pay for unemployment caused by the Board&apos;s orders. In the opinion of the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; arbitration might yet find a solution.(G.)-Food.While &quot; Justice &quot; is pleased that the Trades Union Congress carried a resolution in favour .of a Government subsidy for meat, both the &quot; Herald&quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; support Mr. Clynes in his objections. The writers are evidently impressed by the danger of wages being reduced if a. subsidy is given. At the same time the &quot;Herald&quot; regrets the proposal to increase the price by 2d. per lb., and the &quot;Labour Leader &quot; says the soundest policy is to take all possible steps to eliminate unnecessary expense and profiteering in the distribution of meat.National Kitchens.In view of the coal shortage, a further appeal is made in &quot;Justice&quot; for the organisation of more national kitchens.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Although there has been little actual cessation of work in this area, a considerable number of fresh demands for increased wages have been put forward, principally by employees in public services.Members of the London Temporary Postal Workers&apos; Association threaten to cease work, if an early answer is not received to their demand for higher overtime and Sunday pay.The employees of the Metropolitan Water Board and the staffs of the London Asylums are demanding higher wages.The Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers, &amp;c, threaten to take strong action, if they do not get a 10s. rise per week. They are being supported in their demands by the printing and allied trades.There is a good deal of unrest at Cubitfs over a variety of matters. The draughts-men are annoyed at the threatened dismissal of a man in the drawing office, and other sections are agitating about pay or compulsory unionism.At a meeting of the Army Clothing Employees&apos; Union complaints were made against the slackness of the War Office in answering their demands. Among other resolutions, one was passed demanding the establishment of a M. minimum wage in place of war bonuses.Efforts are being made by the women shop stewards in London to form a really strong organisation among industrial women.The district secretary of the A.S.E. at Ipswich is enquiring whether discharged disabled soldiers, enrolled as War Munitions Volunteers, are receiving full district rates of wages. It is suggested that some employers are refusing to pay the insufficiently-trained men.    \ .West Midlands.A considerable revival of unrest is evident in this area.Dingley is still trying to cause trouble in Birmingham and Coventry over his dismissal. He has lost influence, however, and has been appointed organiser of the Shop Stewards&apos; Works Committees to keep him quiet. He also talks of going into partnership with a friend, as sub-contractor for gauges.[1100-47] &apos;   C
Peacock, who is still employed at Messrs. Austin&apos;s, is attacking the decision of Mr. Hall, labour investigation officer at the works, and trouble is threatened over the dismissal of a man called Dawes.Unrest is spreading among the sheet metal workers and galvanisers in Wolver-hampton owing to the non-payment of a wages award.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unrest in this area has revived.The Leeds Corporation workers are demanding an increase in wages on the ground that these are lower than those of labourers in munition works.There is continual agitation among the Aircraft Woodworkers at Leeds. They demand the dismissal of non-unionist workmen, and refuse to work on piece rates, even with the prospect of earning additional wages.At a meeting of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association on the 11th September at Nottingham the President protested against cases of victimisation, the non-payment of arrears in many collieries, and the scarcity of food.The recent award on colliery surface workers&apos; wages and conditions was challenged at a meeting near Nottingham on the 14th September. A ballot on the question of a strike is to be taken.At Derby the Midland Railway coach builders and engineers have ceased working on Sundays until the coachbuilders&apos; demand for higher Sunday pay is satisfied.North*Western*The situation in the cotton trade is very serious.The Liverpool coalheavers who have resumed work are much annoyed that in the official statement about their strike no mention was made of their original grievance about beer. ----._____________.;.......On the 14th September the National Council of Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees held a meeting at Manchester, and decided to give further consideration to the scheme of the Liverpool Reconstruction Committee after it has been circulated.Northern.This district is fairly quiet, though a strike has occurred in a Durham colliery. Angle-iron strikers in shipbuilding firms on the Tyne are dissatisfied with the present method by which they receive their wages through the smiths.South Wales.There are still signs of discontent among the miners in this district. Agitation in favour of an eight hours&apos; day for all workers in and about the coal-mines continues.Scotland.Unrest is reviving in the Clyde district.The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee is becoming active again. A conference held on the 14th September in Glasgow was attended by delegates from the patternmakers, moulders, shipwrights, metal workers, Clyde Defence Propaganda Committee, Socialist Labour press, and Workers&apos; International Union (late Industrial Workers of Great Britain). Resolutions were passed regarding free speech, John McLean, and the restoration of the Socialist Labour press.Demands for higher wages are being made by the shipwrights, the railwaymen, and by certain colliery workers in this district, and 1,000 shipwrights have stopped work.At a meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress all the&apos; unions pledged them-selves to make a united effort in favour of a 44-hour week after the war; while the bakers and motor drivers demand shorter hours immediately.The restriction on overtime started by the ironmoulders some months ago, and recently adopted by the patternmakers, seems likely to spread. It is relied on as an important means of obtaining advances in wages.
IV. Disputes.The general unrest in the industrial areas has not abated since last week.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports seven fresh stoppages during the week. In three of these work has already been resumed.The blacksmiths and hammermen in the Leigh district have ceased work over a demand for higher wages.   Nine firms are affected.An investigation into the question whether it&apos; is the practice for foremen to be members of Trades Unions has been promised to the electricians at Aintree and on the Mersey. The deputation which visited London told the men they had a promise from the Ministry of Labour that if 75 per cent, were members, the rest would be compelled to join.The engineer charge-hands at Messrs. Rarnage and Fergusons have resumed work pending a settlement by the Ministry of Labour.In. the Hull area a settlement has been negotiated at the Humber Graving Dock, in connection with the electricians&apos; dispute regarding the employment of non-unionists.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 4,341 people involved in strikes for the week ending the 11th September ; at the end of the week as many as 2,107 workers were still out.On the 12th about 250 navvies employed by the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron, and Coal Company (&quot;Newport) struck over an old unsettled claim for an advance of l\d. an hour.About 600 workers have struck at the Air Navigation Company&apos;s works, Addlestone, because the firm withheld payment on their refusal to clock in and out.A strike is in progress among the quarry men at Shepton Mallet on the question of wages and the recognition of the men&apos;a union. The strike was complicated by the fact that enemy prisoners happened to be employed at the time, but the prisoners have now been withdrawn. The munition workers at Frome threaten to join unless the firms concerned negotiate with the National Union of General Workers.The strike is still in progress at the Heaton Chapel Aircraft Works over the question of shop stewards&apos; meetings held during working hours.The Goal Controller reports eight new stoppages, of which four were settled.The Dean and Chapter Colliery (Durham) has been idle since the 7th, owing to a. strike of the putters, who complain that their minimum wage is inadequate. These have not the support of the Miners&apos; Association.The mechanics and deputies employed at this colliery are also on strike over the non-payment of the war bonus for overtime work., About 180 men are on strike at Mill Close lead mine, Derbyshire. The masters threaten to stop the pumping machinery and thus flood the mine if the men do not return. The Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association, to which the men belong, gave notice that they Avould stop the Derbyshire collieries also if this occurs.The War Office Contracts Department reports one new stoppage.The Lancashire cotton spinners ceased work on the 14th September. It is understood that they now propose to claim payment for the ten working hours which have been reduced owing to the shortage of material, and that their demand for the continuance of the rota system has been dropped.Reported from other Sources.The Liverpool coalheavers who struck on the l()th have returned to work pending arbitration on their wage claim.At Lincoln 1,500 boilermakerb, employed at several firms, struck on the 12th becraise of theiv objection to the new one-break system.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports a few controversial cases of minor importance.Carpenters, joiners, sawyers, cabinet makers, shipwrights, and sheet-iron workers employed by several firms on repair work in the Clyde district are refusing to work overtime until acceptance of a claim for a 51. wage per week of 54 hours. Negotiations v are proceeding with the Ministry of Labour. The fitters in Armstrong^ Naval Yard (Clyde) refuse to adopt either piece-work or the premium bonus system, and have refused to discuss the question with the firm.
The Ministry of Munitions has only two controversial cases to report.the carpenters and joiners employed on the erection of the aero sheds at gorse mill aircraft factory (jlollinwood) threaten to cease work unless they are paid an extra 2d. per hour as &quot; danger money.&quot;a strike is feared at the blackburn aeroplane and motor company&apos;8 works, leeds, because one employee refuses to join a union.The Goal Controller has no new controversial cases to report.The War Office Contracts Department reports six new controversial cases.these include demands for higher wages by workers employed in two hosiery factories at belfast.in london the united garment workers&apos; union demands a standard rate for cutters of 5/. a week, inclusive of bonuses.there is considerable unrest in the trade, and this has been intensified by the refusal of the employers in the hat aud cap trade to pay the committee on production^ award of the 19th august. the firms, however, have promised to announce their decision regarding this matter in a few days.The Committee on Production heard thirty-seven cases in London. Chief among them were a claim by the Birmingham patternmakers for an advance of 1/. per week for all men over 18 ; a claim for an advance of id. an hour for all sections affiliated to the National Aircraft Committee ; and several demands for advances to workers in the Cornish mining district.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 155 new differences, eight of which are claims for the 12^- per cent, bonus.Two important cases are mentioned, those of the Liverpool coalheavers and the L.C.C. firemen, whose claims have been referred to arbitration.D.
