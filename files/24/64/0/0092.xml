WAR CABOTT.C-&apos; T -   -5739.&quot;FOOD......JMPORTS&quot;.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture.I associate myself fully with the Food Controller in the memorandum he has submitted on Food Imports (G*T05?88j, In which he &apos; asks the Cabinet to prescribe a minimum importation of 11,700,000 tons of essential food and feeding stuffs.. On any scale that would provide for agriculture a smaller importation cf feeding stuffs than is contained in the programme for 11;700,000 tons it will be necessary both to requisition lean cattls and. sheep from farmers and reduce the head of live stock in the country and also to withdraw compulsorily from the farmer for the supply of the transport horses a considerable proportion of the feeding stuffs - oats, etc., on whioh he is depending for the maintenance of his milch cows, pigs and other live&quot;stocksThe latter course will precipitate organised resistance among the farming eommunity, whioh is at present in a highly ... . disturbed oondition in oonsequenoe ef the restrictions on the supply of feeding stuffs and the shortage of labour in relation to the cultivation programme.    The result will be a reduotim in the production cf milk, meat and cereals, and thus ultimately a greater indent upon shipping in order to bring in the necessary feed.    A forced reduoticn in our live stook must in the absence of feeding stuffs be wasteful and though it may relieve temporarily the shortage of meat it will be at the ccst cf a still greater &quot;shortage later. To a far greater extent than France and Italy the United Kingdom is a meat eating country, and even if we oould be sure of ending the war next year it will be none the less necessary to maintain the supply cf home grown meat after the close of hostilities when shipping will be equally in demand, and this can only be done by maintaining our flocks and herds.    Any foroed reduction in the head of live stook will be disastrous to British Agrioulture*Mr* Hoover and his eblleagues are no doubt singleminded in their view that the Unitod Kingdom should live on its capital and eat down its flooks and herds, but behind this advice the farming community will only see the influence of the great American packing interests, intent upon still further control of the meat supply Of this country.R.
