September, 1918.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,I beg to acknowledge the minute of the   Y.ar   Cabinet 475, 20 September, 1918.     I notice that the War Cabinet instructs you to interview mo on the subject: of the lack of attention bestowed on British as opposed to Dominion troops at the front, and to request me to ,;tako such steps as I think necessary so that the coings of the British troops should receive equal recognition in thq Press with those of the Colonials&quot;.I would propose to put my answer in writing so that you can submit it to tho War Cabinet.As the Kinute suggests I have long realised this difficulty, and made many attempts to get the requisite powers to deal with -it0low that the War Cabinet instructs me tc take steps in this matter,, I would propose *-la        That the Military iiUthoritios should give tho names of officers and men of all ranks who perform any specially conspicu-ous action or.service at tho time of the event, and not as now, only the names from Lieutenant Generals and upwards.     As matters stand, the conspicuous deeds of Canadians, Australians, etc, are sent with full names, to their own local press, shortly after tho action, and no censorship here can or does prevent their publi-cation.     In consequence, the Dominion public gets the impression that no distinguished deeds are ever performed except by their own countrymcin2P        I would propose that the Liilitary Authorities should release for publication&apos;the casualty totals, but I am precluded from doing this because I have recently put this proposal, with full reasons, before the &apos;&apos;/ar Cabinet without success. ; Perhaps, how-over, some member of the &apos;-.ar Cabinet would care to take the matter up again.I would   propose that the kilitary authorities should give due prominence, in names.and details, to the work of our dis-tiuguishod airmen.     On this subject I would issue-a grave warn-ing to the &quot;ar Cabinet, for the situation in Canada is growingThe
-* 2i -The Dominion has contributed largely in personnel to tho It,Aril&quot;&apos;,: it hears of nothing but the exploits of its own airmon, lileo ^Lieutenant Colonel Bishop, V,C0J and in consequence,, it is now being stated in local papers that 75 per cent of the &quot;fighting airmen&quot; are Canadians,The moment a very heavy list of KoAoi!^ casualties comes in,which will of course include some Canadians1 names, there will be aregular outcry to the effect that we are thrusting the whole of tho air fighting on the Canadians,;It is essential that immediate steps should be taken to give our own prominent &quot; .ecs&quot; due recognition for nothing will prevent the Dominion Government from taking advantage of the actions of men like Colonel Bishop for purposes of publicity.The instant that all this information is obtainable and ready for release, I will take steps to secure it the utmost prominence in the Press, not only in the Dominions, but in all countries abroad. But I cannot make bricks without straw, or. sway public opinion without facts,,Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)
