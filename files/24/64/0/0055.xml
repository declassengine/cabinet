/This Document is the Property of JHis Qritan .   . -    iment.) 149j&quot;^ R&amp;IIWME^S TOST.SV&quot;T      Memorandum by the President of the Board ef Trede.As will have been seen from this morning^ newspapers, there appears to be considerable dissatisfaction at certain centres with last week&apos;s settlement of the men&apos;3 clakis for additional war wage, &amp;c.   It has been reported to me this morning that all the locomotive men and many of the traffic men are out &amp;f the following places:-  Severn Tunnel Junction, Newport, Pontypool Road, Llantrissant, Neath, Swansea, L lanelly, Carmarthen.Is Newport and Pontypool Road are what may be termed the gateways of South Wales, the stoppage at those places will have a great effect in bringing to a standstill working into and out of South Wales.  Up to now the Great western Railway Company say they cannot work Admiralty coal trucks and are running a reduced passenger service.  Several workmen^ trains will have to he cancelled and munition trains from Pembrey are not being run.        Practically none of the night goods traira have run.I am in touch with Mr J.H.Thomas of the National Union of Railwamen with regard to the situation, and I understand that Mr J.Bromley of the Associated Society of Locomotive fcngin-eers and Firemen left for Newport this morning stating that he would go there to do his best to stop any extension of the present outbreak, and asking that facilities might be given for the transmission of telegrams which he had sent to various centres with the object of preventing further trouble, and I have arranged with the Postmaster-General for these facilities to be given.I will issue- a further report later in the day, if necessary.A. H. STAKItbY.Board of Trade,23rd September, 1918.
