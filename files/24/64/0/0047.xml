H(This Dor.  . m   isjthrf [ ppei/ty /fSECRET.MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, September 18, 1918.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.It was officially announced in the Press on Saturday, September 14, that in view of the acceptance by Mr. U. F. Wintour, C.B., C.M.G., of the post of Controller of the Stationery Office, in succession to Sir Frederick Atterbury, K.C.B., the Food Controller had asked Sir John Beale, K.B.E., to act as Chief Secretary to the Ministry, in conjunction with Mr. W. H. Beveridge, C.B., as Second Secretary.It wras further stated that, in view of the development of Inter-Allied food control, the Food Controller had decided to set up within the Ministry a Purchasing Board or Committee for British Purchases, to work in connection with the Committee of Representatives set up by the Inter-Allied Food Council.The decision referred to in the second paragraph of the above notice was announced by Mr. Olynes at a meeting of the Allied Food Council held on August 30, when he outlined various measures intended to be taken for the purpose of enabling the Committee of Representatives to exercise effective control in matters concerning transport and purchase. He further proposed that Sir John Beale, who was then independent Chairman of the Committee, should be one of the two British repre-sentatives.Mr. Cotton and Professor Attolico having expressed concurrence, Mr. Clynes&apos; proposals generally were approved by the Food Council, who thereupon passed the following resolutions: &quot; The Food Council having heard Mr. Clynes&apos; statement take note of the proposal that Sir John Beale be appointed as one of the British Representatives on the Committee of Representatives.They also resolve that in that case Sir John Beale should continue to hold the office of Chairman of the Committee of Representatives at the pleasure of the Inter-Allied Food Council and that he should have a vote on the Committee.&quot;Mr. Clynes attended the monthly conference of Divisional Food Commissioners at Grosvenor House on September 19 for the purpose of introducing Sir John Beale to the Commissioners. The Food Controller referred to the recent growth of the Ministry in the direction .of closer relationship with the Food Ministries of Allied countries, France, Italy, and America, and, in some respects, Canada and Australia. He pointed out that Sir John- Beale had won the confidence of the Allies in a conspicuous degree, and on that account his presence in the Ministry of Food had become of great value.Sir John Beale expressed his sense of the responsibility which Mr. Clynes had asked him to undertake. He explained that with the enormous American programme now in execution, and the still more enormous extensions in contemplation, the transport of the world&apos;s food supplies came for the first time in direct conflict with military needs. Hitherto the conflict had been with commercial needs only, but in view of these changed conditions, while enough food was a necessity, no supplies could be called for which economy might enable them to do without.On behalf of the Commissioners, Mr. Curtis welcomed Sir John Beale, and assured him that they would all support his policy to the utmost of their power.A short discussion followed on the control of milk. There was a consensus of opinion that it was necessary to set up a National Clearing-house so as to adjust requirements as between deficit and surplus areas. The only question wras whether it was necessary or desirable to take over the wholesale trade on agency terms. The Commissioners were anxious to effect control with as slight a disturbance of existing conditions as the need for effective distribution would permit.A   (33)6467-8  ?k 1   140  9/18  E*S A
Committee of Representatives. Meetings of the Freight Committee have been held during the week and the question of adjusting the import programme so as to come within the limit of tonnage estimated by the Allied Maritime Transport Council as available during the four months ending December 31, has been considered.Central Agricultural Advisory Council. The fifth meeting of the Council was held on J 7th September, Lord Selborne in the Chair. The draft Pig (Sales) Order, 1918 was approved, and resolutions were passed advising that in future the price of milk and.of home-produced cheese should be fixed simultaneously. With regard to feeding-stuffs it was recommended that a definite policy should be laid down as to the use of dredge corn in 1919, and that the manufacture of compound cakes for feeding cattle should be restricted. A resolution was passed to the effect that &quot; in the interests &quot; of corn production during the forthcoming season, it is desirable that assurances &quot; should now be given that the price of cereals will not be reduced below that of the &quot; present year, with whatever additional sum may be necessary to meet increased &quot; costs of production.&quot; It was also recommended that farmers should receive 5s. per cwt. live weight more for fat cattle estimated to yield more than 58 per cent, of dead meat, and \d. per lb. carcase weight for the offals of cattle and sheep sold on a dead weight basis.Consumers&apos; Council-At a meeting of the Council on September 18, a resolution of protest was carried against the decision of the Ministry in raising the price of milk to the farmers to 2s. M. per gallon, the Council being of opinion that no case had been made out for any increase beyond 2s.Control of Supplies and Prices.Butter.-The usual fortnightly distribution of butter, amounting to 20 per cent, of the month&apos;s applications, or approximately 4,300 tons, was made to retailers and caterers on Monday, September 16th. The total amount of butter on the water on September 14th was 2,225 tons, while stocks at present on hand, excluding Irish butter, total 8,500 tons.The retail price of Government butter was temporarily reduced from 2s. Qd. to 2s. id. per lb. in June, and the Ministry of Food have been able to maintain dis-tributions at the reduced price for nearly three months. It is now necessary that the retail price of Government butter released by the Ministry for distribution on and after 16th September should revert to 2s. Qd. Government butter released by the Ministry before the 16th September for distribution will be sold off at the 2s. id. rate.Cereals. An interdepartmental conference has been held at the Local Government Board for the purpose of considering possible economies in the manufacture and distribution of bread. The Board are interested in the maintenance of one-man businesses ; the Ministry of National Service in obtaining men for the Army; the Coal Controller in securing the more economic use of fuel; the Road Transport Board in restricting movement; and the Food Controller in effecting concentration of baking and eliminating overlapping deliveries in order to -maintain the 9d. loaf without increased cost to the State. Both masters and operatives assured the departmental representative that they were prepared to co-operate with the Govern-meht in the direction desired, and would endeavour to outline a general scheme for submission to local associations. Experimental schemes are already being tried in two provincial towns.In pursuance of the discussion referred to in last week&apos;s Report as to the best means of providing increased supplies of food for town horses, the Wheat Commission have announced that they are prepared to buy through their accredited agents from recognised dealers the available surplus of feeding oats in Scotland. Similar arrangements have been made in Ireland for purchases to be effected through the agents of the Army Council. It is not, however, clear that any considerable quantity will be forthcoming in the absence of compulsory measures, and there are considerable objections to imposing further statutory restrictions on the use by farmers of their oats.The Oats (Registration of Dealers) (Ireland) Order, 1918, is designed to prevent the continued evasions in Ireland of the Grain Prices Order, whereby farmers have been in the habit of selling to dealers under the guise of seed oats practically all the oats which they $id not use themselves at prices considerably beyond the permitted
maximum. It is believed that whenever suspicion justifies inquiry an examination of the books of a registered dealer will clearly show whether each transaction has or has not been genuine.Cocoa. The first meeting of the Raw Cocoa Distribution Committee was held on the 12th September, when approximately 8,000 bags were distributed among the manufacturers.   The scheme appears to be working successfully.Dried Fruits. 500 tons of currants of recent arrivals have been allocated to the War Office for immediate transmission to the troops in France.Eggs. With a view to maintaining the supply of eggs during the winter months, the Ministry of Food has acquired certain stocks of imported and pickled eggs which, so far as possible, will be distributed through the usual trade channels, beginning next October. Egg importers may apply for appointments as selling agents on defined terms and conditions. Under the Egg (Licensing of Wholesale Dealers) Order, wholesale dealers are required to be licensed by the Ministry of Food.The margins of gross profit allowed under the distribution scheme are as follows : 1. To selling agents, 9d. per long hundred.2. To wholesale dealers, Is. 6d. per long hundred.3. To retail dealers, 5s. per long hundred.Licensed wholesale dealers may obtain supplies of eggs held by the Ministry of Food, from any firm acting as selling agents with whom they were doing business prior to 1st May 1918, on the condition that they must supply the eggs so obtained to any retail dealer with whom they also were doing business prior to that. The price at which these imported and pickled eggs may be sold to the consumer will be fixed from time to time, and it is expected that the opening price will be 4\d. each to the consumer.. Jam. An Order has been issued for the purpose of including within the provisions of the Jam (Prices) Order jam or jelly made with an admixture of marrow, and of providing for the description of jam or jelly made with such admixture.The Jam Manufacturers (Restrictions) Order, 19.18, dated September 18, restricts except under licence the sale of jam in quantities exceeding one ton. Retailers have in several cases received consignments which they were unable to store, and have consequently sold freely to all comers. In one town 2,0001. worth of jam was disposed of in this manner, and considerable dissatisfaction was.caused in neigh-bouring districts.Meat. Now that the harvest is completed in the greater part of the country, live stock is coming forward to the markets far more rapidly, and in every area an increase in supplies is reported. It appears that farmers are disposed to rush in their stock, owing to the uncertainty of their position in respect of feeding-stuffs, and there is already a grave danger that herds may be depleted to an extent that will jeopardise the supplies upon which reliance is placed for the period after Christmas. In the absence of feeding-stuffs it is doubtful whether farmers can afford to hold back their beasts until the full advantage of the sliding scale of prices becomes due.Orders have been issued increasing the price of meat, except pork, as from September 22nd. by 2d. per lb.; pork prices will be increased by the same amount as from October 6th. Notices under the Meat (Retail Prices) Orders prescribe the new retail prices of meat, while amendments of the Meat (Maximum Prices) Order, 191.7, and the Edible Offals (Maximum Prices) Order, 1917, prescribe the new wholesale prices of meat and the new prices of offals respectively. The new prices show a general increase of 2d. per lb. on the current prices.The scheme for limiting the consumption of canned meats to those classes to whom it is an essential article of diet will, in all probability, involve further regis-tration by the consumer, in view of the limited supplies that will be available.The Table of Equivalent Weights has been amended in accordance with the lowered scale of the meat ration.Oils and Fats. The Director of Oils and Fats has at present under consideration the control of soap prices. The Soap Makers&apos; Federation has been asked to suggest a scheme whereby control can be undertaken on the basis of a uniform specification for soap throughout the United Kingdom. A further report will be made when the proposals of the, Sqap Makers&apos; Federation have been received and considered..    ..;.

This is the 27th sentence of imprisonment recorded this year.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.There was a further widespread fall in imports during the week ending September 14th. The aggregate quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs received was 140,300 tons against 174,600 tons in the previous week and 19.1,100 tons in the corresponding week of last year (Table A). Compared with 1917 the decline was most marked in cereals, many of the other items showing increases.Wheat and (lour together were 62,400 tons. In equivalent grain the falling off on the week before amounted to 32,400 tons, and on a year ago to 39,500 tons. Little rice arrived, and barley, oats and maize together were only 15,600 tons against 45,400 tons in the week ending September 15th, 1917.All classes of meat were lower. Bacon and hams fell from 19,800 tons to 10,800 tons, a figure substantially below average, though well above that of a year ago. Beef, mutton, and.unenumerated meat, taken together, dropped from 5,400 tons to 3,800 tons..&apos; Cheese was good, more than 7,700 tons arriving as compared with 2,600 tons in the previous week.   Condensed milk continued at the high level that has been reachedDivisional Reports.North Midland. A distribution scheme lor prime fish has been started at Grimsby which promises to work well. As the vessels discharge their cargoes, the total weights of prime fish in their catches is sent to the Distribution Officer. No buyer is allowed to purchase without an allocation card till 12 noon, after which time the producer may deal with the fish as he pleases. With a view to facilitating the distribution of the cheaper kinds of fish, an arrangement has been suggested with one of the largest firms on the docks at Grimsby, who are willing to place their staff and organisation at the disposal of the Ministry of Food. They would buy the surplus fish, and deliver it to the railways at a charge covering expenses, but with no margin of profit to themselves. The firm is supplying fish to the Navy and Army Canteen Board on the same lines.South Wales. Rabbits are coming into the market well, and the price fixed by the recent Order appears adequate for securing a supply.Scotland, West. The arrangements for the issue of road permits for the transport of game have been carried out, and are proving most satisfactory. They have been much welcomed by the proprietors and tenants of deer-forests and grouse shootings, and are of great assistance in the placing of game on the market for public consumption.Enforcement of Orders.Enforcement. The total number of prosecutions for the week is 564, of which 512 resulted in convictions. 109 of the cases were from Ireland with 88 per cent, of convictions. Scotland contributed 19 cases, all of which resulted in convictions. Wales 24, also with 100 per cent, of convictions.The Divisions showing the greatest number of prosecutions are : Division. Cases. Convictions.
in recent weeks. Butter was again a negligible import; unless oversea shipments are soon expedited the maintenance of a 2-oz. ration during the winter will be impossible.   Lard at Jess than 2,100 tons was below current consumption.Sugar at 27,400 tons was fairly satisfactory. Cocoa showed a big improvement to 2,600 tons, the largest quantity received in any week this year.Consumption.Meat. Increasing numbers of livestock continue to come forward at the markets. During the last few weeks the consumption of meat has approximated to the maximum quantity under the ration.
