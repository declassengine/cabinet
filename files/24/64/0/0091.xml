this Document, Is the Pnlis Britannic ftty&apos;s Government)FOOD IMPORTS.Memorandum by tho Food Controller,By Minute No, 470 of the 6th September, 1918, the war Cabinet, on consideration of Paper G.T. 5612, decided that determination of the amount of food imports into this country for the year commencing 1st September last should be deferred pending a further meeting of the A.M.T.C. at the end of tho present month.After careful consideration and discussion with the Shipping Controller and the President of the Board of Agriculture, I venture to suggest that this decision should be reviewed, and the principles of food Importation should be definitely decided by the Cabinet before the A.M*T.C* meets.   I put forward this request on the following grounds(a) It is agreed that a minimum importation of essen-tial food commodities should have definite priority in the allocation of transport facilities.(b) The British food policy must be settled &quot;with re-gard to political considerations of the most serious charao-ter, which oannot be fully appreciated by representatives of Allied Countries.(c) Preliminary investigation has shown that the volume of food importation must be the definite limiting factor determining the size of the American Trooping Programme and the programme of Munitions Importation.(d) The United Kingdom Pood Importation Programme must necessarily in view of their smaller home production largely exceed the combined Programmes of Prance and Italy, and it is natural, therefore, that the Representatives of these countries, and ;of America, should regard it with a jealous and critical eye*   Allied criticism will be difficult to meet, if it should be supported by criticism from anyother/
other British Government Department.   On the other hand, if tht programme has been accepted by the Cabinet before the discussions take plaoe, and in the course of those disous-sions it is supported by Representatives of every British Government Department, whether Naval, Military, Shipping or Financial,, it is probable that the Allies will regard the Programme as inevitable and accept it.The question to be determined in olear-cut.   In Cabinet Paper G.T.5612^ I pointed out that by a serious restriction of animal feeding stuffs, and by living on clocks to a large, extent, it would be possible to reduce the total importation to 11,700,000 tons.    Indications from the A.M.T,C, suggest that tha^body have in mind a considerably greater restrio-tlon   of imports, and both the American and French Represen-tatives on the -allied Food Counoll have stated that this country will be taking a grave responsibility if, by insist-ing on so large a food importation, It limits the American military effort, and that such aotion would create a very bad impression in their oountries.In my opinion a smaller importation would be attended by the greatest possible risks, and would, In all probabil-ity, defeat the object for which it is imposed, either by-oausing aotual shortages leading to industrial unrest, or by seriously handicapping the farming interests - in either case greatly lessening production In this country.The deficiency caused by the smaller importation would have to be met either by;-(a) Serious limitation of the bread oonsumptio^ by means of bread tiokets, or(b) Adopting the policy of drastic reduction of herds and flocks in this country, and requisitioning off the farms both animals ard grain.The/
Tho restriction of or.2ad consumption by tickets would not achieve its purpose of affecting a large roduotion in imports unless consumption was drastically reduced.   Any such drastic reduction woul  fall mainly on the lass well-paid working classes whosa staple food is bread.   Such a course must entail restriction of output, since the, energy produced by food will be definitely lessened, and it would probably causa grava industrial unrast in addition.Tha alternative of living on herds and requisitioning farmers1 produce was strongly urged by Mr.   Hoover as the right policy when he was in this oountry, and it has since been continually urged at Inter-Allied Conferences by the French and /imarican Representatives supported by tha Italian Represent at iva, since tho practice has already*proceed ad to great length in Italy.   In my view, thenotpolicy should/be adopted, as it is likely to antagonise the entita farming interest, and, therefore, to inoraaso greatly tha  ifficultios of food supply and food control.I should add that, for purely domestic reasons, it is extremely desirable that the amount of food importation which can be raliad on should ba determined without further delay.     Perhaps the most urgent food question calling for solution at the present time is that of tha proper provision and distribution of animal feeding stuffs.     Schemes for dealing with this -uestion have boon under discussion for a considerable   period, and if an adequate importation can be relied on, can be put in forca without delay; but they would have to ba entirely ra-cast if a further severe restriction of importation has to be faced,fir rang omen ts as to tha milk and meat supplies of tha country are held up until tha feeding stuff supply question can ba settled -
2hiI would therefore ask:-  &apos;(1)        That the Cabinet definitely prescribe importat ion of the essential minimum of food (on the basis of the policy defined as the second cut   in Memorandum GT 5612) whether it amounts to 11,^00,000 tons or some lower figure resulting from more complete estimates made later in the year, and(2)       That the Representatives of all Go^ra-meni Departments concerned In Inter-Allied discussions should be requested to treat this as a final determination of the question, and, indeed, engage on a species of propaganda work among Allied Representatives in support of the reasonableness of the decision.J.R.
