1,    The Shipping Controller has had the advantage - of reading the FQod Controller !s Memorandum which is &quot;being submitted to the Cabinet simultaneously with this npte.in view particularly of the meeting of the Allied Maritime Transport Council on September 30th at which the allegation of Allied shipping between Pood and Munitions will be discussed,3,    He agrees that, while it is right and desirable that at any Allied meeting the general case of Allied Munitions as against Allied Food should be argued, it is undesirable that different British representatives should be expressing contrary views as to a purely British^ as distinct from Allied, f$o&amp; or agricultural policy.4.

arranged this, however; in the hope and belief that America will give as much assistance to the European Allies later in the boreal year as we now give her.    In that event an 1305 Allied food importation (which under present arrangements implies 10.5 not 11.7, for Great Britain) Would after allowing for military oats and certain sundries leave a total importation for munitions for the t^ree European countries, of about16*3 million tons.This figure would be reduced to about 15 millions if tho British food importation were raised to 11.7The Allied lunitions programme has not yet been received but it will probably exceed even the higher of the above figures by some millions.The Minister of Munitions -will doubtless state the effect of the reduction indicated..6.    If the American Military Programme is treated as the adjusting service, a difference of 1,200,000 tons (i.ea tho difference between 10.5 and 11.7) may be taken as meaning a difference of 240,000 American soldiers in the number whioh can be maintained in, and therefore sent to, Pranoe.7.    In view of the obviously grave results the Shipping Controller would strongly urge that the polioy adopted shoull be such as to give the maximum possible saying to tonnage.   As an example he would point cut that it requires, several tons of imported food to produce 1 ton of pigmeat in.this country, and, that an important saving could be effected by importing tho&apos;pigmeat from ^Imerioa instead.
8,   The Shipping Controller understands the effect of the Food Controllers first proposal to be to adopt the poliey described in CT.6612 (Second Cut) vis., to make a exit of 500,000 tons belbv; the &quot;agreed minimum&quot; of feeding stuffs and to discontinue the maintenance of the pig.While this means considerable reduotion he would urge, for the reasons indicated above that the policy should be carried further to the utmost possible point.9.   There is one consideration to which the Shipping Controller attaches special importance.Until the spring or summer of next year America cannot give shipping assistance to the European Allies and may require assistance from them.    Thereafter, however, America1s shipping position should be substantially better than theirs.   It is of the utmost importance that she should before then be brought in the fullest sense into the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the associated Allied bodies, so that her ships may be available with our own to meet the most urgent needs of any of the four Allies and not be used to make Americans position better than ourscThere is good hope fcf securing.this object.   The greatest danger is that there should be a serious difference of opinion as to policy affecting tonnage. lr.Ho.over when here expressed the strongest opinion that, in view of the tonnage position, we should live on our herds.    We may well find it extremely difficult to secure American shipping assistance to. meet -a nee?, whioh arises because we have not done so.   It is essential, for this most important question.of general policy, that the American food representatives should be in hearty accord with the fool importation policy now determined by the British Government.lo.
10. The Shipping Controller agrees that it is important that the Cabinet should prescribe a British polioy on this question which will enable the various British Representatives to express consistent views at Allied discussions.26/9/1916
