51SXConfidential.Political Intelligence-Department,21st September, 1918.Foreign Office., S.W.1, AUSTRIA/009.MEMORANDUM onThe Antecedents of the Austrian Peaee Note.On September 8th the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; published a leading article by Count Czernin, the late Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, , It turns against those on either side who hope flbr victory.- &quot;When we advance, we speak of a &apos;hard peace1 -when the Entente gains ground, they declare against all corn-promise.    At this moment they are drunk with victory over there, they imagine that they are able to break through and force a military decision] disappointment and disillusion will come as certainly as that the sun will set at night, but then we must not again wander away from the idea of peace by conciliation or we shall move In a circle until all of us, friends and enemies are ruined.&quot;    The article then proceeds to discuss the idea of a League of Nations as a war aim common to both sides and calls on Austria to raise it as the watchword which is to lead to a better future.According to a heavily censored report in the &quot;Reichspost&quot; of September 10th, Czernin had intended to put forward these ideas in a speech which he was to have delivered on receiving .the freedom of the city of Vienna.    The ceremony having  been postponed, he published it as an article.It is difficult, almost impossible, to determine whether this article was written in an understanding with Burian, though the last paragraph, containing a veiled reproach at Burian&apos;s address, points in the opposite direction.    But then it is possible that Ozernin co-operated with certain Vienna
M 2 -*Court circles behind tho bac^. of the Magyar Burian.     On the next day, September 9th, Count Burian delivered a speech to the representatives of the German press who had come on a visit to Vienna,    He spoke about victory beinr; very Improbable if not impossible for either side, and then again and again in a way alluded to, and in a way complained of the Entente aiming at the disruption of Austria.    &quot;The question suggests itself whether it is not a crime against humanity to think of completely destroying things which are the product of history, and which here as well as on the other side require improvement, but are capable of improvement, in order to found a future paradise on the ruins, a paradise which has this defect, that in view of the destructive-methods of our opponents, it cannot be created   -except at the price of excessively great sacrifices?&quot;    Further on he again complains of the Allies desiring to &quot;set right the inner affairs of other nations which are quite capable of doing so themselves&quot;.    He finished with an explicit appeal for &quot;a direct informative conversation, which would fr- no means amount to peace negotiations, but at which everything which now divides*the belligerent parties could l^e discussed and considered, and then soon perhaps no further fighting will be required in order to achieve a rapprochement between them&quot;.These are in short the antecedents of the Peace Note as far as they are revealed in the Vienna press up to  September 11th.    The tone in which that press discussed these proposals can be described as well-nigh hysterical.    It is not the way in which people would speak who expect to go on fighting. These two facts are obvious: (1) That Austria-Hungary must have peace, and that the ruling circles feel a horror of what may happen if they fail to obtain it.     (2)   That the negotiations for an understanding with Germany have borken down or at least have reached once more a dead point.    It was obvious that the
Central Powers worked hard for an understanding concerning EasternEurope which oould be expressed in a series of faits aocomplis,and which they would then try to carry through as far as possibleat the general Peace Conference.    If then Austria-Hungary hasnow oome out with a peace proposal without these negotiationshaving resulted in a definite agreement, it is obvious that anImpasse has been reached once more.    This is especially markedin the oase of Poland.    Berlin wires exaggerate the seriousness fof the Cabinet crisis in Poland and suggest that the PolishYCouncil of State will certainly refuse either of the two offered Solutions. &apos; Translated into simple terms, this means that as Polish opinion turns against the German Solution, the Germans, preferring an Impasse to the Austrian Solution, wish to prevent any settlement and thus try to get out of their promise to abide by the decision of the Poles.    It was obvious all along that should the Poles choose the Austrian Solution, there would be little danger of anything happening at all.Should any further answer be given to Austria in a more argumentative form, either in a speech or in&apos;the press, it might be worth while to point out the absurd contradiction between. Burials speech whioh alluded to the Allied programme with regard to Austria, and the Note which tried to make out that Great Britain agrees to the continued existence of the Habsburg Monarchy,It is but natural that even the German and Magyar Jingoes in Austria should be in favour of immediate peace.    Their annexationism Is not external but internal.    They do not so much desire new territories as the possibility of exerting an undis* turbed dominion over the races which ere already subject to them. The moderation of Austria-Hungary is in reality merely apparent, and this again might be worth pointing^out should the discussion assume a controversial form.21,9.18.
