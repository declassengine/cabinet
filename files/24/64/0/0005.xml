BRIANS i;:0R INCREASED MQE* Mempranflm &quot;by ggs. J^I,Barnes.1* The Bailwaymen demand 10/- -increase in their war wage..They demand that the women he paid 10a- as well as the men, and that it should apply to all their members in the shops., as wellas on the traffic system.      The demands are complicated by the proposal to merge existing percentage increases; but In effect they involve 35/- on to their pre-war wages.. 8,        The pre-war wage averaged 28/- per week; the proposal now made therefore, is to put it up to a figure 12bf0 above the pre-war levels      Ho other industry has as yet doubled its wageSs   Therefore tp give the 10/- wou^d mean putting the Rail--waymen relatively in a much better position than any other in--dustry, and it would be followed by demands for like advances on the part of employees in other industries*   In short, it would land us in another oyole of unrest and trouble.3.        The claim is made that the Railwayman started on a lower base line, and that therefore they are entitled to a larger war--bonus.,    They also object to the statement of 28/- as applied to the men on whose behalf they claim; because, they say, 28/-may have been the average, but the actual wage of large numbers was very much smaller than 28/- and that therefore, even with the additional amounts paid as war-bonus, many of the Railwaymem are still in receipt of wages below a deoent level and much less than are earned by girls living and working in the same vicinity. - Such, briefly, are the arguments and statements on both sides,4* It is feared that a stoppage of work may occur unlessthe Executive of the H.U.R. and the other Railway Unions are satisfied.    At Liverpool, in South 7Ja3.es, and Glasgow the pos--ition is said to be somewhat critical, and although a general stoppage is not feared, there might be isolated stoppages and much friction.50 The increase of 5/- (which was offered last week andaccepted by the Association of Locomotive -Engineers but not by the B.U.R.) was put forward with the proviso that further claims, either on their part or on the part of other industries, should be dealt with by one authority, and that such claims should be s^mitted to that authority whenever it was thought proper.&amp;T. The 5/- would mean &apos;60/- upon their pre-war wage of 28/-which would give them 104$ increase and leave them better off relatively than any other trade or industry.      After disoussinn with the President of the Doard of Trade and his advisers, the following scheme was agreed to tentatively, as a means of sur--mounting the present trouble(l)   That an increase of 5/- should be calculated as from 10th August 1918 :
)(B) that should be taken as representing the increase in the cost of living up to that elate       and(3) that war wages should rise and fall with increased cost of living over 90$ at the rate of l/- per week for every 3$ increase in the cost of living5?he above provisions to be operated by, or on behalf of, the properly constituted arbitration authority.7.     I think the time has now come when we ought to deal with these wage questions by and through one supreme authority,,   The Ooinmittee on Production, I think, should be that eu.thori.ty..--    It has dealt very well with oases whic have come be lore ifco     It has slaved a great deal of trouble to the ocuory, and has, iiept things going in many Industrie But it is not; 3air to&apos; the Committee on Production that Dei: irtmeuts s.h-;&quot;iud run up wages and force the Committee into.awards not justified on the evidence submitted, save in so far as the relative position of the claimants is shown to have been affected by inoreases granted to other people.8.     In other words, the decision of the Cabinet of last January, (iVar Cabinet 3^.7,Min.l9) should be strictly adhered to$I venture to suggest that the Cabinet should new re-affirm that decision which is as follows,r All applications for an increase in war advances and wage disputes arising there--from, shall be referred for decision to the Ministry of Labour, who may refer them to the Committee on Production.Phe Ministry of Labour will have discretion to ask the &quot;Department concerned to oarjpyoa any necessary negotiations, but the finaj, decision will in all oases rest with the&apos; Ministry of Labour.&quot;and that a public statement on the general Labour policy of the Government, as suggested in &apos;.,;iar Cabinet 317 (5), should be made at an earlt date.(Initialled)   m.b,2, i-ftdtehall Gardens, S.W...1 17th September 1918.
