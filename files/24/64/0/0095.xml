S E 0 ii E T,Y/ AJ*   G AH il U.G.1,-6792,, LABOUR flUSSTIOffS MD TJIE OABlM.J^omoj     r hr. ;Aust on Chnmb er 1 a j, n,I suggestecfo the Cabinet the other day that it would he well to appoint a Cabinet Committee on Labour questions similar in character to the existing Cabinet Committees on Home cand Economic Affairs./   It would perhaps be useful to develop a little more fully my reasons for the suggestion.The present system of Government has been forced upon us by the exigencies of War, Now Departments have been created and new duties assigned as the need arose without any precise definition of the eoope of their authority, and without any careful attention to the question of over-lapping. Thus very important sections of Labour are now controlled by tfee Ministry of Lunitions, the Admiralty, tho Board of Trade and the v;or Office respectively, and strong Labour branches have grown up in each of these offices unconnnctcd with and not responsible to the Ministry of Labour,   Tho result is that papers concerning Labour,  often of a very important character, come before tho Cabinet without any evidence that they have been considered by trio Kinistcr of Labour, or that tho effect of tho proposals on other labour-employing Depart-ments have been discussed with those concerned.   It cannot be satisfactory to the Cabinet to discuss Labour problems under ouch conditions.   Our time is occupied in listening to discussions between Departments on questions which would have been much better thrashed - out.between them before tho subject was brought to the Cabinet, or in giving decisions on questions of which we have no direct personal knowledge and ) on which our&apos; txSorE.:.&quot;&apos;.&apos;;on is insufficient to give us confidencein the soundness of our decision,
Such a state of things must be detrimental to all oon-cerned.   labour questions are settled pieoemeal without anygeneral policy.   Some of the Departments oonoerned must ofiiM^ feel that their co.se has received insufficient consideration,! and the Cabinet itself has more than once discovered that it has taken a decision without seeing clearly the full results tc which it must lead,Por these reasons, even if it were only as a war measure I think it would be desirable to constitute a Cabinet Labour Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Barne but I believe the good, effect of this proposal.would be not leas felt in the re-arrangement - of business which must follow on the conclusion of peace.   How that we have a LabourMinistry, Labour questions should be more and more ooncentra-t in the hands of the Minister of Labour,   At present there is no such concentration and no effective no-ordination&quot;)., but a Labour Committee, sitting regularly and considering all questions y/hich were of more than purely departmental con* oern, would gradually focus those questions in a common oent and would make it easier to seoure their concentration in the Ministry of Labour when the time for reconstruction comes,,Thu3 no office has more to gain from the&apos; creation of-such a Committee than the Ministry of Labour, but I believe thatevery office dealing with Labour problems would profit by theopportunity of closer and more continuous co-operation andthat we should be relieved of some, at least, of the complainwhich now reach us, that measures proposed by one Departmententirely upset the policy of another.Department.   As eachDepartment ha3 had occasion to make this complaint in turn,.it is evident that the present difficulties arise from lackof system in dealing with these matters and not from thefault of any particular Department.(Intd.)
