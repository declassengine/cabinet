THE   COAL PROKLIJ,.Copy of letter from Sir Adam lUmuo to the Frime Hinistcr. -;Sir,The Goal problem.I have already addressed Communications en this subject to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to the president of the Eoard of Trade and only the vital necessities of the situation and the responsibilities which you hove invited me to assume urge me to bring certain considerations under your notice.The decision of the V/ar Cabinet as to bringing men back from the forces is being held up pending an investigation by the Ministry cf Munitions and the Admiralty as to a possible modification of their programmes in respect of/vTar Coal consumption, r-Cabinet468,Iain . The Admiralty may decide tc reduce their consumption13. but their requirements will ultimately be determined by thenecessities of a verying naval position and if any emergency arises these requirements will have to be met irrespective of consequences in other directions.Turning to the Ministry of Munitions, their programme may be capable of modification without detriment to the national position.      That is net my province to determine, but what I fear is that the cutting down of their programme may not materialise in a corresponding reduction in fuel consumption.       It is one thing to modify the output of munitions and quite another to secure that at the works involved there will bo any material reduction in power used much less a corresponding reduction, unless the&apos; stoppage of works is contemplated,  in which case the problem of unem.ploymcnt emerges,I hesitate to believe, however,  that the industries engaged on war materials oeuld be slowed down sufficiently quickly to give us the benefit that we require v/ithin the time at our disposal and in this matter time is of essential importance,  as the situation will have become acute during the winter months and if it is permitted to become seriously disturbed it will be impossible to.put it right with tho means at our disposal.Industrial rationing of what are called less essential or non-essential industries in rLlation to the V7ar is a question surrounded with many difficulties.    It requires to be undertaken carefully and after a close analysis of partic-ular industries, and within such industries, of individual works.     To make anything like a material clean.cut into these industries will, in my opinion, bring about a great deal of unemployment with, its attendant evils, while it will at the same time cause xrery serious loss to the industries con-cerned.I do
I do not suggest that something may not be gained, by industrial rationing in Coal,but if it is done intelligently and wisely from an all round national point of view it vail not yield what is anticipated from it.    If, on the other hand, any drastic proposals are put into operation I think the results are greatly to be feared from the point of view of public policy.The Scheme of domestic rationing is severe.   It is calculated to save 8jOOO,OOO tons during the next twolve months.   The want of these 8,000,000 tons, however, will affect the Country very Considerably more than appears on the surface, as the shortage of Coal will bite more quickly and deeper into the moral of the people than a shortage in food. It has also to be kept in view in this oonneotion that it will be a matter of extreme difficulty to absolutely assure the domestic consumer of even his reduced supply.   The dis-tribution of Coal cannot be made so absolute   as the dis-tribution of food, as the constantly varying Admiralty and shipping situation makes it extremely difficult to secure stability and if as is to be the case, there is a short output and the various essential allocations, apart from &apos;j that to be made to the domestic consumer, have to be met, the pressure to neglect the domestic supply will be very great,A great deal of privation may therefore be expereinoed in the homos of the people at a time when they require to be kept strong and steadfast,I know that a feeling exists that the miners might do better if they were properly handled and were urged to give an increased output.   I do not say that propaganda work among them may not do good, but in my opinion such work will not be seen in any material additional tonnage,   If it stops leakages and gives security against unnecessary idle time it wrili have done all that can reasonably be expected of it.I repeat, however, what I already said at the meeting of the War Cabinet at which I was present,- that the Miners may be expected to bo more difficult to control as the emergency in Coal develops and the propaganda work undertaken towards them and towards the general public may bo found to be a two-edged weapon exposing the necessities of the country on the one hand and revealing the opportunity and power of the men on the other, which they may be tempted to use for their own ends.Looking at the position from every point of view as far as I am able to do so, my considered opinion is that the proper course to take is to bring back the equivalent of 50,000 able-bodied men and to bring them back at once.   There may be difficulties in the way of bringing men back but they can be overcome and these difficulties in my view are as nothing compared with the difficulties that will develop in many directions if we move,  as we arc doing, into an exceedingly acute coal position.The security to the country and to the Allied Cause lies in bringing the men back from the Forces.   The contri-bution which this country is making in Coal to that Cause is of immense importance.   Franco and Italy arc dependent on us for Coal; America is now demanding large supplies, and there appears to be every prospect of her demands increasing;neutral
neutral markets have to be supplied as a set off against essential services rendered by these countries to our &quot;own. The financial position of the country will he materially assisted by maintaining the production of Coal and it will assist the maintenance of.exchange,      We cannot adequately meet ell the demands that are made upon us in Coal and at the same time sustain the Home position in reasonable comfort having regard to the anticipated&quot; output&apos;.   To weaken the Coal position is to weaken the.whole structure and-1 oannot believe that it can be in the interests of the country to do so when all that is, involved is the. r.. turn of 50,000 men.I desire to make it clear to you &quot;that in my view the anticipated shortage in Coal is much too great to be overcome by any temporising expedients.   Only a strong polioy of putting a sufficient number of men badk into the industry tb meet tho deficiency and to lose no time in carrying it out will adequately meet the situation.Yours faithfully,(Sd.)
