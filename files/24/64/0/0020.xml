I  agree with the views expressed by the Minister of Munitions in reference to.the grant of the Gallipoli Star or Medal.    ly view has always been that there.should be one medal with a clasp for Gallipoli.    This however I understand is now out of the question and I therefore desire to urge that the decoration should be issued to all who took part in that wonderful campaign.When this subject came up for discussion in the Conference I thought it was my duty to confine myself to the case of the Dominions.The Representatives of the War Office told us quite definitely that the far Office would never consent to issue any special decoration to the Troops other than those from the Dominions.- I never believed that this decision could be. defended or sustained, but my opinion was not asked, and I therefore confined myself to the demands made by the Dominions.    I think there is no doubt as to the strength and unanimity of public opinion upon this matter.W.H.L. 8.9.18.
