The Bill was duly prepared and was substantially in the form of that passed in 1914 by-Standing Committee B.Tiie object of the Bill was to afford.a.measure of protection to rare wild birds by restricting the trade in their plumage.     India and certain of the Dominions hare already passed measures restricting the export of plumage5 and a prohibition of importation into the United Kingdom is desirable in order to assist in the prevention of \ %   smuggling.This Bill was submitted to the War Cabinet and referred by the War Cabinet to the Committee on Home Affairs who expressed general sympathy with the object of the Bill but could not recommend its introduction at that time, (October  4th 1919).The Bill has since been revised in the Department and simplified, in consultation with the other Departments concerned, and colonel late and Colonel Arthur Murray (representing the Boyal Society above referred to).It is understood&apos;that it is the Bill so revised which Lord Aberdeen has introduced in the House of Lords, and in the circumstances it would seem desirable that the Government should announce in the House of Lords that the Bill has their approvaloiw   1
Cabinet authority is accordingly sought for the adoption of this course.A copy of the Bill as revised in the department is annexed hereto. *-12th March, 1920.
