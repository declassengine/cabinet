Memorandum &quot;by the Port and Transit Executive Committee on the&quot;Government Coastal subsidy scheme *,The estimated weights of cargoes carried coastwise (ex-, eluding coal, and Intercourse between Great Britain and Ireland) for the United Kingdom were :-1913:12,000,000 and 13,000,000 tons.1919,: -5,000,000 to     6,000,000 tons, a decrease of nearly 6Q%*.The CPastal subsidy Scheme was started-August 21st 1919. It has affected tonnage at the rate of about- 2,000,000 tons per annum, 35^ of the total weight carried Coastwise above referred to,It is estimated that the vessels carrying the above ton-nage under the Scheme also handled an equal&apos; quantity not covered by-it.A Committee was appointed by the Minister of Transport to consider the effect of the increased Railway charges on Coastwise Shipping.   Their report of flth January 1920, approved in principle by the Minister, states - &quot;the complete withdrawal of the subsidy would result in a great deal of the traffic which has been diverted to Coastwise sailings under the present Scheme reverting to the rails, thus intensifying the present congestion on the^iftilways.1&apos;Meanwhile, congestion of Ports and shortage of trucks and sheets are reported daily from the main ports of the Country.The only ju st if i cation for abolishing the Subsidy would be the capacity of the Railways to handle promptly the extra traffic thereby thrown back upon them.   There is no evidence at present that the Railways can do any such thing.   Overside facilities must be maintained in addition to oufivsiae facili-ti-.es-: deifcy in * turn- round1 of ships is otherwise inevitable.Many of the lesser POrts depend, almost entirely upon the Coastal Trade for t eir traffic-.   Both their labour conditions and their usefulness as distributors inland must be seriously damaged by any decline of Coastal shipping..

Estimated future cost - after allowing for increased railway rates on the&apos; one hand and increased freights en the other **  100.,000 per month. 9. The Subsidy is in principle undesirable.   But until the broad question of the permanent relation of Railway Rates to Coastal shipping Freights has been decided, and until Railway facilities can deal more adquately than at present with port Traffic, the Subsidy, in the opinion oif this Committee, should be continued, subject to any necessary safeguards. 10* Nfrmal conditions in the Ports can be reached by oneroad only, which leads through the removal of Congestion to an improvement&apos; of &apos; turn-round&apos;, ana through that again to a natural reduction of frei iits down to a competitive level.(Sgd.)
