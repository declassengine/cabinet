This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.^    .V .-WTV.-T-.4,1   o&apos;.14THE CABINET.LI?OE OF THE REALM (ACQUISITION OF LAND) BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I desire to submit for the approval of the Cabinet the attached draft of a Bill q to amend the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916 (to which no &apos; serious opposition is anticipated) with a view to its introduction in Parliament as early as possible in the present Session.2. The validation of action taken since the outbreak of war in regard to the compulsory acquisition of land and buildings by or on behalf of Government Departments and in regard to the payment of compensation therefor is, in accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet, being dealt with in the Indemnity Bill (G.T. 7877). There are, however, certain other points in which the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, requires amendment, and the necessary powers are asked for in the draft Bill, as explained in the following paragraphs : Clause 1.3. Where land subject to restrictive covenants is acquired under the Acquisition of Land Act, 1916, and is used by a Government Department in a way which is inconsistent with those covenants, compensation for any damage caused by such user is payable to the person entitled to the benefit of the covenants under Section 4 of the Act. A doubt has been suggested whether if the land is subsequently sold under Section 5 of the Act the restrictive covenants would not revive, but, assuming that they would not, it would appear that further compensation might have to be paid to the persons entitled to the benefit of them.This clause is intended to remove the doubt as to the revival of the restrictive covenants in the event of sale and to provide that any compensation paid under Section 4 of the Act in respect of the use of the property by a Government Department should be taken into account in assessing the compensation payable under Section 5 when the property is sold.Clause 2,4, Under Section 5 (3) of the Act of 1916, a Government Department is obliged, before selling any land acquired under it, other than land used in connection with permanent buildings erected at the public expense, to offer it to the owner of the land from which.it was originally severed and, if he does not buy, to the adjoining owner or owners.This obligation makes it impossible for the Government to accept an offer, however favourable, from a third party until the land has first been offered to the persons entitled to rights of pre-emption and each of them has declined to purchase or allowed a period of six weeks to elapse without exercising his rights Where, as in some cases has actually occurred, there are a large number of adjoining owners, the advantageous disposal of the property may become almost an impossibility.While it is not desired to take away the right of pre-emption from the original owner or from his family, so long as the estate from which the land was severed remains in their possession, there seems no sufficient reason for giving such a right to a person who has purchased the estate after the severance and still less to adjoining owners who may have never had any interest in the land at all.This clause, accordingly, limits the rights of pre-emption to the person who was entitled to the estate at the time of the severance, or to persons who have become entitled thereto by descent, will or settlement. It also provides that a person who would for the time being be entitled to exercise the right, shall have power to release it in perpetuity.Clause 3.5. Under Defence of the Realm Regulations 2 L and 2 M the Board of Agriculture are expressly empowered to lease land of which they have taken possession under those regulations.(B20/132)   100   3/20  H&amp;S   8025woen. No, 8 802
This clause make it clear that notwithstanding such lease, the Board of Agriculture is to, be treated as being still in possession of the land for the purposes of the Act of 1916, so as to enable them (if necessary) to remain in possession after the war, or buy, under the provision of the Act.It may also be useful in cases where third parties [eg., munition firms) have been allowed to occupy premises which have been taken over under Defence of the Realm powers.Clause 4.6. This clause clears up a small (but -not unimportant) point of doubt. The Act of 1916 defines land as including easements and rights over or in relation to land, but it is not clear whether the exercise of such a right as that of emptying drains into the sewers of a local authority would be held to be the taking &quot; possession of land &quot; within the meaning of those words as used in Section 1 of the Act of 1916, even though land includes a right over or in relation to land, There are other easements, such as rights of lights and rights of way, as to which the same question may arise. It is essential that there should be power to continue the exercise after the war of rights such as those above mentioned.This clause was included in a draft Bill submitted to the War Cabinet in October, 1917 (G.T. 2153), and again in November, 1917 (G.T. 2749), and approved by them in principle on each occasion (War Cabinet 247, dated 9th October, 1917, and 285, dated 28th November, 1917).Clause 5.7. Byedaws can be made under the Military Lands Acts for regulating the use of land appropriated for military purposes, but various formalities have to be observed and consents obtained; and, in particular, no bye-law can interfere with the use of a public footpath or other highway except with the consent of the highway authority.Defence of the Realm Regulation No. 17 dispensed with the necessity of observing these formalities or obtaining these consents, and about 200 sets of bye-laws have been made under it for ranges and military areas.These bye-laws will, in cases where they are required permanently, be replaced in due course by bye-laws made under the ordinary Peace procedure, but the process will inevitably take a considerable time, and it is necessary to provide for the continued validity in the meantime of the Bye-laws made under emergency powers.The period should be at least two years, as it is impossible, to say what bye-laws will be required permanently until the future locations of the After-war Army and of the ranges required for the Territorial Force have been definitely settled. &apos;No objection can fairly be taken to this. The Principal Act has authorized the continued occupation for two years after the war (and longer with certain consents) of land originally occupied under emergency powers, and the present clause provides for the continued validity of certain bye-laws which were made under emergency powers and without which the continued occupation of the land woald be of no use.. The clause is, therefore, a corollary to the rights already conferred by the Principal Act.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Ofeice.12th March, 1920.
