CP. 88Q. &apos;&quot; &quot;   &quot;IMPERIAL WAR MU8W!&apos;,Memorandum by the First Commisaioner of Works,covering &quot;Draft gTTu-It will be remembered that the War Cabinet decided on the 5th March, 1917 (W.C. 87) to institute a Committee to go into the question of the collection of the imperial War Museum, and I was appointed the Chairman of the Committee.   The result of the labours of the Committee, assisted as it has been by the active support of the various Fighting and Civilian Departments, and of the Generals Commanding the various Fronts, has been a very complete and highly interesting collection of material illustrating the War in all its phases and on all its Fronts.   With the consent of the Treasury, the Committee has made arrangements with the ftTrustees of the Crystal palace for accommodating this collection at the Crystal palace, on a lease of four years, and it is arranged to open the Museum in its temporary home in June next.The task of collecting has almost reached its ena, and the question arises of the permanent organisation and administra-tion of the imperial War Museum.   It is obviously nec^eisary that a permanent body should be created in whom this valuable collec-tion can be legally vested, as I am advised that Government property must be vested either in some Minister or in some body of Trustees.   As long as the exhibits of the Museum were&apos; in charge of various Departments, this had not become necessary, but now that they are being transferred entirely to the Imperial War Museum Committee, who have no legal status, it becomes necessary to create a corporate and legal body.   For this purpose, in consultation with the Director General of the Museum, sir Martin Conway and with the Treasury, the accompanying Draft Bill has
been prepared which I beg to submit for the sanction of the Cabinet so that I may introduce it at an early opportunity - in the House.   Following the lines of that dealing with other National Collections, the Bill provides for the establishment and constitution of a Board of Trustees for the purpose of managing the Museum, and. vesting in the Trustees the objects given to, acquired for,- or transferred to the Museum.   The Trustees will be empowered to appoint a staff to assist the present Director General and curator of the Museum, each of whom will continue to hold office.His Royal Highness, the Prixwsf Wales, has graciously consented to become the first president of the Board of Trustees.As no money ie asked for in the Bill, its purpose being merely to regularise the existing positior , I do not antici-pate that it will be opposed in any of its stages through the House of Commons.   I should like an early decision on this matter as the Bill should be passed this Session,   I would suggest that it be referred to the Home Affairs Committee for consideration and decision.(Sgd.)
