Nil.Part II.-Departmental.Local Organisation: Divisional Councils.To secure the full co-operation necessary in different districts between the local representatives of the various branches of the Ministry, namely, the Appointments, Training, Employment, Wages and Arbitration, and Industries Departments, Divisional Councils have recently been set up, composed of the chief local representatives of these branches of the Ministry and the Finance Department. These councils meet once at least in every fortnight for the interchange of information and the discussion of common interests.(0 1974*  J50  3/20 H&amp;S    &apos; S
Any local schemes formulated by any branch of the Ministry which appear to bear on the activities of any of the other branches are to be fully discussed by these bodies. It is expected that by the loan or transfer of staff or premises which can be arranged by the Divisional Councils, economy can be ensured, and that by frequent consultation of this kind the duplication of visits to employers for the purposes of canvass or inquiry can be avoided. Any points of difficulty which may arise locally in the operation of the arrangements already formulated for the co-operation of the departments can also be settled locally and speedily.Part III. The Labour and Socialist Press.Direct versus Political Action.The special Trades Union Congress, which is to meet on the 11th March, does not arouse much comment in the papers reviewed this week.  It is worthy of note that what discussion there is does not deal with the question of nationalisation but rather with the question of direct action.  In this respect a difference may be noted between this dis-cussion and that which took place at the time of the Labour Party conference at Southport last June.*  Then, the question of Russian intervention itself assumed more importance than the means by which such intervention might be stopped.   Now, the discussion upon means is more vital than the discussion upon ends.  The reason for this is that difference of opinion existed on the policy of Russian intervention, whereas with regard to the nationalisation of the mines the only difference of opinion in Labour and Socialist circles is not as to the desirability of attaining the end, but merely as to the means to be adopted to secure that end.  The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; and the &quot; Nation &quot; contain articles in which arguments against direct action are fully put forth.  The &quot; Nation &quot; recommends propaganda and political action as being more practicable than the general strike.   The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; insists that constitutional machinery already exists by which the people can obtain any reform they may desire.   On the other hand, Mr. John Bryan, in &quot; The Call,&apos;&apos; argues that in the present conditions Labour is impotent. He expects that the Trades Union Congress will decide against direct action and thinks that the labour movement is therefore on the eve of one of the greatest of its defeats. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; neglects the Trades Union Congress and devotes its attention to the Shop Stewards&apos; Conference.   It insists that the programme which Labour should adopt must be one of socialisation, not nationalisation, of confiscation, not compensation. The writers to the I.L.P. papers are silent on this subject, but their point of view may be judged from a leading article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; which discusses the conflict between the police and the procession of the ex-Service men from Woolwich which took place on the 1st inst.  The thesis is put forward that &quot; the ruling classes are deliberately planning to provoke the workers, before they have the authority of Parliament behind them, to outbreaks of violence which can easily be crushed and used to discredit the socialist ideal.&quot; With reference to the current view that the expected decision of the T.U.C. in favour of political action will be followed by a national miners&apos; movement for increased wages, the &quot; New Age &quot; expresses the opinion that there is a limit to the power of the miners to force up their wages.  The miners&apos; leaders are warned that a wages strike need not neces-sarily be any more successful than a strike to enforce the adoption of the Sankey report.The Paisley By-election.The return of Mr. Asquith to the House of Commons on the 1st March arouses much attention. In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the so-called &quot; Paisley Programme &quot; is summarised and is approved; the only doubt of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is that Mr. Asquith&apos;s past is such that he will not be able to persuade the electors of the country of the sincerity of his present professions. Mr. Philip Snow den. in this paper, and Mr. Ramsay Mac-donald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; are more concerned with the effect Mr. Asquith&apos;s return will have upon the position and prospects of the Parliamentary Labour Party. They both insist that his return to Parliament will increase the difficulties of this party in i^s endeavour to become the official Opposition. Mr. Snowden is of the opinion that the Parliamentary Labour Party will cease to count, unless it displays more courage, assiduity, and capacity ;( but Mr. Macdonald hopes that a better attendance on the part of Labour Members in debates and divisions will do much to counteract Mr. Asquith&apos;s occasional* Cf. Reports, July 2nd and 9th, 1919.
* Of. Eeport, 25th February, p. 103. (C 1974)f Of. Report, 3rd inst., p. 118.t Cf. ibid. S 2presence. The &quot; Nation &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; are concerned with the effect of Mr. Asquith&apos;s return on the Government. They both think that he will be an appreciable check upon the freedom of action of the Prime Minister. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; recom-mends the Labour Party to get its own house in order and remedy its more obvious shortcomings, and not to build upon any hope that at an early date it may command a Parliamentary majority.The Labour Movement.Discussions upon domestic questions remain the principal feature of the more extreme papers. In &quot; The Call &quot; the position of Communists in general, and the British Socialist Party in particular, with regard to the Labour Party, is fully explored. It is insisted that the Labour Party, in spite of its defects, remains the peculiar organisation of the working classes of the country. It is urged that the &quot; Communists &quot; should devote their attention to agitation within the Labour Party, which will provide them with the best machinery by which they can put their views before the proletariat. The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; on the other hand, catalogues the follies and the sins of the Labour Party. This paper is none too scrupulous in its choice of weapons, and copies the greater part of its criticisms from the I.L.P. journals. A fortnight ago in an attack upon the British Socialist Party the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; printed a letter from Mr. W. Gallacher* ; this week Mr. Gallacher explains in &quot; The Call &quot; that the letter was written some months ago in connec-tion with the attempt to form a united Communist Party, was an especially confidential letter, and was published without his consent. It may be judged that this absorption of the organs of the more extreme socialist parties in domestic quarrels results from two events, the abortive scheme for the formation of a Communist Party by an amalgamation of the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, the Socialist Labour Party, the South Wales Socialist Party, and the British Socialist Party; and the recent conference jit Amsterdam of Third International enthusiasts. The Amsterdam meeting would appear to have been broken up before arriving at any definite recommendations as to the attitude Communist parties should adopt towards Parliamentary activities. This exceedingly indefinite state of affairs gives ample scope for intrigue among these extreme parties in their competition to be regarded each as the sole legitimate apostle in Great Britain of pure Bolshevist doctrine.The &quot; Socialist&quot; deals at greater length than last week with the relations between the Socialist Party of Ireland and Sinn Fein.f Irish socialists are recommended to educate their trade unions in revolutionary doctrine, to prepare revolutionary workers&apos; organisations, and to be ready for the inevitable collapse of the capitalist Sinn Fein Republic, when and if it is realised in fact. In connection with the opinion of the trade union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; that the importance of the industrial union movement to socialism must not be exaggerated,! it is interesting to note that the &quot; Rail-way Review &quot; devotes a leading article to the policy of the N.U.R. The aim of the N.U.R. is stated to be to control a monopoly of labour in the railway industry and thus to prepare the way for the control by the workers of the railways. In such workers&apos; control of industry the &quot; Railway Review &quot; sees the hope of the future.Government Policy.The Unemployment Insurance Bill is referred to in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; the &quot; Labour Pioneer,&quot; the &quot; Democrat &quot; and the &quot; New Age.&quot; The most significant of these references is that of Mr. Tom Myers, the new member of Parliament for the Spen Valley Division, who deals with the second reading debate in a weekly article which he is contributing to the &quot; Labour Pioneer.&quot; He is of the opinion that &quot; if suitably amended in Committee, this Bill will be some contribution towards easing the penalties of one of the most serious defects in our industrial system.&quot; He compares the reception accorded to this Bill with the reception of the National Insurance Act of 1911, to show how much we have pro-gressed in recent years. He is markedly more favourable to the Bill than have been the official spokesmen of the Independent Labour Party in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; Mr. Jesson, in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; explains the provisions of the Bill and congratulates the Government on its proposals. Mr. A. Taylor, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; is more critical and complains of the administrative expenses which will be incurred in connection with the scheme. His criticism, however, is based upon an error: he compares the adminis-trative expenses with the State contribution towards the benefits, and not with the total sum of the benefits; which, even then, would not provide a complete criticism of the scheme.   The &quot; New Age &quot; asks why Labour welcomed this Bill, the main purpose of
which, in the opinion of this paper, is to rob Labour of its most fundamental objection to &quot; increased production.&quot;The first volume of the report of the Ministry of National Service* is noticed in the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; and the &quot; Clarion.&quot; The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; uses the report to show the need for better conditions of labour in textile factories, while the &quot; Clarion &quot; bases upon the report an indictment of past methods of government in England. The decision not to disband the Ministry of Food is discussed in the &quot; Demo-crat &quot; and in &quot; Justice.&quot; The &quot; Democrat &quot; acquiesces in the decision, urges that the work of the Ministry must be conducted with greater care and efficiency in the future, and that the individual citizens of the country can do more by their own efforts to keep prices low and regulate consumption, than any Government department. Mr. H. M. Hyndman in &quot;Justice&quot; complains of the rumours that the ex-Food Controller was responsible for this decision. He claims for the Consumers&apos; Council all the credit and insists that it is the duty of the organisations represented on this Council to make all prepara-tions to start a menacing agitation in case the power of the Ministry of Food should be impaired.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; devotes a special article to reconsidering the case for a capital levy in the light of Sir John Anderson&apos;s evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons which is considering the taxation of war increases of wealth. With reference to the trouble in the Road Transport Industry this paper repeats its regrets that the Industrial Courts Act does not include a clause providing that an agreement arrived at by representative organisations of employers and workers in an industry may be made obligatory upon the industry as a whole.Wages and the Cost of Living.Mr. Philip Snowden discusses the rumour that the Labour Party are about to open a popular campaign against high prices. In such a campaign he recommends that they should have a clear objective and clear proposals.^ It would be a fatal mistake, in his opinion, for the Labour Party to confine itself to denouncing profiteering and to convey to the public the impression that, by dealing with profiteering, the cost of living can be Very materially reduced. He thinks it would be dishonest to hold out the expectation that we can escape for a long time from a condition in which world prices will be abnormally high. Mr. Snowden apparently shares the opinion expressed last week in a leading article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; that we cannot escape the rain which has been brought upon the world by the war. The trade union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; sum-marises the arguments which are being advanced against the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; index number as a means of determining wage movements. He argues that the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; figures are not by any means based upon a complete account of items of working-class expenditure ; he claims that rises in wages did not keep pace with the rise in the cost of living from 1904 to 1914; and he mentions the doubts which have been cast upon the accuracy of these figures. &quot; The Ministry of Labour should explain exactly how they are obtained so that the method of arriving at the percentages can be checked.&quot; A paragraph appears in both the &quot; Labour Pioneer &quot; and the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer&quot; based upon a recent article in the &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; the purpose of which is to cast doubt upon the truth of the current &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; index number. It is stated that the cost of maintenance in the institutions under the control of the Salf ord Board of Guardians has increased by 190 per cent, since July, 1914, and a comparison is made between the 1914 and 1920 wholesale prices of a series of articles of food. It may be noted that two errors are made in these criticisms of the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; index number. The cor-respondent to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; appears to assume that the more articles are included in the comparison, the greater the percentage increase will be found to be ; and the paragraph based upon the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; article assumes that the percentage increase in retail prices must be greater than the percentage increase in wholesale prices. In the &quot; Railway Review,&quot; Mr. A. E. Rochester continues the discussion on the sliding scale clause in the agreement concluded between the N.U.R. and the Ministry of Transport. Mr. Rochester adopts the arguments advanced by Mr. C. T. Cramp at the beginning of this discussion in favour of a sliding scale, f In &quot;Forward,&quot; Sir Leo Money outlines the policy he would adopt towards trusts and combines. This policy is public ownership with joint management by representatives of the State, the consumer, and the employee. In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; Mr. W. Harbutt compares the proposal emanating from Wigan for municipal currency notes unfavourably with the Bradford project for a municipal bank. Mr. Harbutfs main argument against the Wigan proposal is that it must inevitably result in inflated currency and increased prices.* Omd. 504.f Of. Report, 4th February, p. 62.
Part IV. General Topics.Survey of Industrial Demands and Disputes.The week has been remarkable for the amount of negotiation that has taken place on a variety of matters. Much of this has been in preparation for the special Trades Union Congress to be held on the 11th March to decide the form of action to be taken to secure the nationalisation of the mines. Most of the constituent associations of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, as well as the Federation itself, have held conferences to decide on their policy. Conferences of other trade unions for the same purpose have also taken place.  An account of these conferences is given below.The dispute in the commercial road transport industry was referred to arbitration at a further meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the industry held at Montagu House on the 9th March. This meeting was held at the suggestion of the Ministry of Labour, and after prolonged sittings of the two sides jointly and separately, it was finally agreed to refer the claim for a 10s. advance in wages to arbitration by the Industrial Court. The Ministry also intervened in connection with the threatened strike of London omnibus men who intend to protest against the discharge of 500 temporary employees by the London General Omnibus Company. Subsequently, private negotiations between the parties took placa and the possibility of a stoppage appears now to be remote, although harmonious relationships have not yet been restored.With regard to the unofficial strike of Welsh steel workers, the men agreed to the proposal of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation executive that they should resume work on condition that the period covered by the unofficial strike should form part of four weeks&apos; notice to cease work to enforce their claim for a 40 per cent, advance in wages. The employers, however, maintained that no notices had been tendered by the strikers, so that, should they resume work, it must be on the understanding that 28 days&apos; notice elating from the resumption of work must be given. This produced a deadlock for a time, but the men have decided to resume work, a conference to be held next week. Other outstanding disputes are the strike of Dundee plumbers and the lock-out of Glasgow plumbers which are holding up building operations in these districts. In the latter case the dispute was occasioned by the refusal of the master plumbers to recognise the Ministry of Labour apprenticeship scheme. A strike of 40 workpeople took place and this was followed by a general lock-out. The men have brought their case to the notice of the Glasgow Corporation.Reports tend to show that the railway clerks throughout the country are generally dissatisfied with the new classification scheme and some threats of drastic action have been made.A settlement was effected during the week in the mining industry, the Throckley dispute having been brought to an end by the employers agreeing to reinstate the suspected checkweighman at the Blucher pit after his acquittal in the legal proceedings against him.   Work was accordingly resumed at all the pits affected on the 3rd March.The Unemployment Positim.There was a total reduction of 17,454 in the number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged on the 27th February compared with a reduction of 17,675 between the 13th and (C 1974) S3France.The French railway strike receives far more attention than the French Socialist Party Congress at Strasburg. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Nation &quot; regard the resolution of the Socialist Party with regard to the Second International as dealing a fatal blow to that organisation. With regard to the railway strike, the more moderate papers are unanimous in their condemnation. Mr. Philip Snowden&apos;s opinion is typical: &quot; The strike was a foolish and futile attempt to. start the social revolution.&quot; The &quot;New Statesman &quot; draws attention to the manifesto of the Confederation Generate du Travail with reference to public ownership of the French railways, combined with control by the railwaymen, as showing the universality of the principles of guild socialism. The more extreme papers rejoice in the strike. Though the &quot; Socialist,&quot; writing before the strike was settled, expects a victory for the men, and &quot; The Call,&quot; on the other hand, writes in the knowledge of a defeat for the men, the opinions of the two papers are identical. An unsuccessful strike, in their opinion, is almost as desirable an object as a successful strike : in either case the revolution stands to gain.
20th February. The total number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged on the 27th February was 289,139 for men and 4,005 for women. Unemployment books remain-ing lodged on the 27th February show a reduction of 4,893 during the week compared with a reduction of 5,319 during the previous week, books lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 27th February being 68,337 for males and 29,595 for females. At the 20th February, 1,420 H.M. Forces policies remained lodged by short-time workers, chiefly in the engineering and ironfounding trades-compared with 2,070 for the week ended the 13th February, 1920.Employment Exchange live- registers at the 27th February showed 369,802 men, 53,201 women and 22,030 juveniles, compared with 393,604 men, 53,902 women and 23,432 juveniles at week ending the 20th February and 416,892 men, 51,791 women and 24,590 juveniles at week ending the 13th February, 1920.The Nationalisation of the Mines.A national conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain was held on the 10th March in order to decide on the policy its delegates should adopt at the Trades Union Congress on the following day. The delegates to the conference had been instructed by their districts as to the action they should recommend and the final figures of the voting were as follows : For trades union action in the form of a general strike to secure the nationalisation of the mines, 524,000 ; against, 436,000 ; majority in favour of direct action, 178,000. The districts voted as follows : For direct action South Wales, Lancashire and Cheshire, Scotland, Midlands, Derbyshire, North Somerset, Bristol, North-cumberland, Forest of Dean and Kent: against Yorkshire, Durham, Cumberland, Leices-ter, South Derbyshire, North Wales, Cleveland and the coke and colliery enginemen. A feature of this decision is the moderate size of the majority in favour of direct action. For some time it has been apparent, as has been indicated in this Eeport, that the Trades Union Congress* was not likely to. declare in favour of direct action, and the feeling that a vote for direct action would not find general support has probably contributed to diminish the majority in its favour. The miners have often stood aloof from the rest of labour, and their industry in some ways fosters such aloofness. But in a matter like this, the general atmosphere is bound to count for a good deal.The fact that such a large number voted against direct action may be said to mark the failure of the long continued Labour campaign in favour of nationalisation. In view of this it may be apposite to trace very briefly the course of this campaign since its inauguration some months ago. Although this campaign has been ostensibly con-ducted not only by the miners but by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Co-operative Movement, its active prosecution has devolved almost entirely on the miners&apos; leaders and especially Mr. Frank Hodges. In the course of the campaign its character has gradually but significantly changed. At the beginning the main argument used was the advantage likely to accrue to the whole cOm-munity as consumers of coal if the mines were nationalised. It was maintained that nationalisation would result in an increase in production and a decrease in the cost of production, and would thus benefit the community as a whole. As time went on it became apparent that the ostensibly altruistic motif of the campaign was failing to impress the general public and was, in mmy cases, alienating the rank and file of the miners. The leaders, therefore, determined to give a new turn to the campaign. About the middle of January an opportunity was presented to them by the temporary shortage of domestic coal and the increased exports of industrial coal at high prices. They immediately made this situation the chief plank in the nationalisation platform, and argued that only the complete nationalisation of the industry would prevent the amassing of private fortunes at the expense of the miner and the general consumer. It continued to become clear, however, that the rank and file of the miners, specially in South Wales, were less concerned with the problematical benefit the community might derive from nationalisation than with the actual advantages they would themselves secure by making fresh wage demands. By the beginning of February it seemed certain that the miners would not strike for the sake of nationalisation, though they would probably vote for strike action at the T.U.C. (a very different thing), but that after the T.U.C. they would probably launch a campaign for increased wages.* At the Congress, after an address by Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., Mr. F. Hodges, for the M.F.G-.B., spoke in favour of trade union action in the form of a general strike, while Mr. T. Shaw, M.P., and Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., spoke in favour of political action. The Congress proceeded to vote on the alternative courses of action outlined in the agenda. The card vote in favour of political action was 3,732,000; against, 1,015,000 : in favour of trade union action, 1,050,000 ; against, 3,870,000 ; the majority in favour of political action was 2,717,000, and against direct action was 2,820,000. The total card vote in the first case was 4,747,000, in the second 4,920,000. &apos;. .
South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.A special conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has had under considera-tion, in addition to the question of the policy to be taken at the forthcoming Trades Union Congress, the problem of prices and wages. The Executive has proposed a scheme for the standardisation of wages at all the collieries in the coalfields. At present there are something like thirty different rates of pay for the different grades of workmen, and the scheme provides for the grouping of these thirty grades into three classes. The Executive proposed that the wage rates shall be : Class I, 8s. per day ; Class IT, 7s. per day ; Class III, 6s. per day. This, with the addition of percentages, war wages and &quot; Sankey &quot; wages, works&apos; out at 17s. 6d. per day for workers in Class I, and 14s. 6d. per day for Class III, which consists of unskilled men. The proposal was referred back by the Conference to the Executive for certain readjustments. Pending the conclusion of the negotiations with regard to this scheme of re-grading, the Conference decided that the South Wales delegates to the Miners&apos; Federation Conference should press that an application be made for an immediate all-round increase of wages of  2 per week. This claim, was made not only in respect of the high cost of living but as a protest against the unsatisfactory negotiations with the Government with regard to a reduction in the price of industrial coal.The Building Guild Movement.Further progress has been made by the Manchester Building Guild Committee, and the Irlam Urban District Council has accepted, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Health, the estimate presented by the Manchester Building Guild for the erection of 474 houses, to form an instalment of the 1,000 houses which the Guild has offered to build. The work will be done at net cost and the 10 per cent, commission which the Guild will receive will be payable on the net cost and not on the estimate. The Guild undertakes to mobilise the necessary labour and to carry out the complete management of the work from the moment the building materials are delivered on the site. The cost of building the 474 houses, not including the Guild&apos;s percentage commission, is estimated at  456,000. It will thus be seen that the original optimistic estimates of the lowr cost of building by the Guild are not fulfilled. The Bournemouth Town Council has accepted a tender from the recently formed Bournemouth and District Builders&apos; Guild for the erection of 20 houses. It is also reported that a building guild is proposed for Isleworth and Hounslow.The Control of the Liquor Trade.A conference took place on the 6th March- at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, to consider the question of securing public ownership and control of the liquor trade. Mr. C. T. Cramp presided, and Mr. Duncan Carmichael moved a resolution in support of the principle of State control. Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., supported the resolution. He stated that, if as Labour men they associated themselves with the prohibition movement, the effect would be to weaken the movement and cause internal divisions which would be a disturbing factor in the larger political prospects of Labour.The Building Trade and Overtime.As the result of a conference of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives in Manchester, it has been decided to recommend to a ballot vote of the whole of the build-ing operatives a proposal for the working of overtime on the building of houses. A national 44-hour week had been agreed upon in the building trades to operate from 1st May. The proposal which is now being balloted on is that from that time an extra hour per day from Monday to Friday inclusive should be worked, payment to be at normal and not overtime rates; but no man should be penalised if he desires to work only 44 hours. On all other work but the building of houses systematic overtime will be strictly forbidden.Transport Workers&apos; Federation.A demonstration organised by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation took place on the 8th March at the Albert Hall. Mr. H. Gosling took the chair and proposed a resolution to the effect that &quot; this meeting of transport workers adheres to its demand for a 16s. minimum and makes common cause with the transport workers of all other ports in establishing standard minimum rates in accordance with the policy expressed by their representatives at the Court of Inquiry.&quot; Mr. J. Sexton, M.P., seconded the resolution. Mr. Bevin, in supporting the resolution, emphasised the value of the Court of Inquiry not only as a method of settling the dispute but as a platform from which to publish the claims and needs of Labour. Mr. Robert Williams urged the need for closer Co-operation between the great Labour organisations. If direct action were ever forced upon them, his wish was that other organisations would be as faithful to them as they had been to the
railwaymen. Mr. J. Jones also supported the resolution, which was carried unanimously. At this meeting no references were made to the fact that the Transport Workers&apos; Federation is at present putting forward a large number of demands on behalf of the various bodies affiliated to it. In addition to the wage demand of the dockers, a demand for an advance of 10s. a week for commercial road transport workers other than omnibus and tramway workers has been referred for arbitration to the Industrial Court, and a further claim for omnibus and tramway workers will be dealt with by the Industrial Court on the 11th March. One or two other sectional demands are also being supported by the Transport Workers&apos; Federation.Cotton Trade Control Board.A scheme has been drawn up for the disposal of the surplus funds remaining in the hands of the Cotton Control Board. The original purpose of the fund, which was raised by a levy on the employers, was to provide unemployment grants. The surplus which remains for disposal is stated to be  1,500,000 and it is to be devoted to the good of the textile industry of Lancashire. It is suggested that the fund shall be called The Cotton Trade War Memorial Fund. The proceeds are to be devoted to expenditure under two main heads (a) Benefactions to the operatives in the cotton trade ; (b) the welfare of the cotton trade as a whole. Under (a) grants may be made to men permanently disabled in the war, to the families and dependents of those who have fallen in the war, for educational schemes and for pensions for long service records, or for those permanently disabled by accidents or for the dependents of those fatally injured in the course of their employment. Under (6) grants may be made to scientific and educational research in connection with the cotton trade, towards the development of Empire-grown cotton, towards the investigation of Labour or trade conditions in the textile industry in foreign countries, to the working and administration expenses of the Cotton Reconstruction Board, and to assisting any scheme for dealing with unemployment that may be set up by the cotton trade and sanctioned by the C4overnment.The Union of Post Office Workers.When the Union of Post Office Workers was inaugurated a few months ago, it decided on the adoption of a strike policy. When the new executive committee assumed office it appointed a special committee to draw up a scheme in accordance with this resolution. The committee has now presented its report which recommends the institution of a strike fund with a subscription of Qd. per week in order to build up a reserve. It is expected that this proposal will be placed before the next conference of the union for approval. Even, if this course is adopted, it would clearly be a long time before a large fund could be built up on the basis of a weekly contribution of Qd., and therefore if the postal workers should decide to strike in the near future they would certainly not derive financial support from their union. It is reported that the Tracers&apos; Association has decided to amalgamate with the Union of Post Office Workers.Rank and File Movement.The first session of the special &quot;Rank and File Convention,&quot; summoned to meet at the same time as the special Trades Union Congress was held at the Central Hall, West-minster, on the 10th March. About 70 delegates representing trade union branches, workers&apos; committees and various extremist groups, were present. Mr. Tom Mann was to have presided over the meeting, but was unable to be present; his place was taken first by Mr. Arthur MacManus and later by Mr. Kealey. Resolutions were passed calling on the Trades Union Congress &quot; to take steps to bring about a general strike to wrest the mines from the capitalists,&quot; and setting up a special Mines Committee to press forward the strike policy and to co-operate with the Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform Committee in the formulation of a scheme for the &quot; sovietism &quot; of the mining industry. Further resolutions condemned the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress for its failure to place the Russian question on the agenda of the special conference, and offered fraternal greetings to the Russian Soviet Republic. The most striking feature of the meeting was the uncom-promising hostility to the Trades Union Congress which, voiced by one speaker after another, resulted in the Convention practically abandoning, in favour of independent action, its self-appointed function of watching and criticising the Congress. There was also a tendency on the part of delegates to criticise their own organisation as displaying the Very fault imputed to the official trade union movement, that of talking continually instead of acting. The lack of effective backing from the organisations represented was rather more apparent th&amp;n usual and it becomes increasingly evident that the so-called &quot; rank and file movement &quot; depends to a remarkable degree on the personalities of its leaders a strange contradiction.
Non-unionism.There are local indications that the problem of non-unionism is again becoming pro-minent. Nottingham No. 5 Branch of the N.U.R. has called for a decision by the executive that after the 1st May no member of the union shall work with non-unionists. The Electrical Trades Union has given notice to the Blackburn Electricity Committee that cable jointers belonging to the union are ordered not to connect up electrical supply to installations erected by a plumber or non-unionist. The Council of the Islington Metropolitan Borough has followed the example of other Metropolitan Borough Councils in which labour has a majority, by deciding that in future it will only negotiate with its employees through their respective trade unions, and employees are to be asked to join the trade unions which exist for their particular grades of work. It is stated that the Guildford Trades and Labour Council has secured from the Friary Brewery Company, Guildford, the recognition of the principle that members of trade unions in its employment shall be entitled to the same privileges in its pension and insurance scheme as other employees of the company. It may be recalled that when this company originally announced its pension and insurance scheme it stipulated that this should be open only to non-trade-unionists.Amalgamation.It is reported that a proposal is on foot to amalgamate the National Union of Vehicle Builders, the Amalgamated Society of &quot;Wheelwrights and Smiths and the Railway Vehicle Builders into a Society to be known as the Amalgamated Society of Vehicle Builders. The Manchester members of the third organisation have unanimously supported the proposal which will be decided on a ballot to be concluded by the 1st May. The President of the London Branch of the Boot Section of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees recently urged that the National Union of Boot and Shoe Opera-tives should attempt to secure the amalgamation of all unions catering for boot workers. This is an interesting suggestion in view of the negotiations which are at present taking place for the amalgamation of the A.U.C.E. as a whole with the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks.Professional Workers.A Joint Committee has been set up to discuss the relations between the newly-formed Federation of Professional, Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Associations and the Professional Workers&apos; Federation, and to arrange for joint action on questions of mutual concern. It is reported that the first named Association is at present considering the position of salaried workers under the Employment Insurance Bill. The latter Association which claimed about a year ag6 to represent 174,000 organised salaried workers, has not, so far, taken a prominent place in industrial negotiation. It recently advocated that representative consultative committees on the lines of the consumers&apos; councils should be set up to deal with all questions relating to the social and domestic life of the people. The National Association of Local Government Officers has decided to invite the National Union of Teachers, the Civil Servants&apos; organisations and the National Association of Poor Law Officers to a conference to consider the position of public servants in relation to the efforts now being made to federate professional workers. This brings the number of competing federations of professional workers to four.   (See this Report, pages 78 and 94:)The International Relations of Labour.Movements in favour of re-constituting international federations in particular in-dustries are growing in force. A Congress was opened in Vienna on the 4th February for the purpose of re-constituting the National Federation of Postal Workers which was originally formed in 1914. It is stated that, as re-constituted, the Federation will form a full trade union federation in touch with the International Federation of Trade Unions. The adhesion of Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia and France has been announced, and it is hoped to&apos; secure that of Russia, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden. The Dutch Agricultural Workers&apos; Union has extended an invitation to the Agricultural Labourers&apos; and Rural Workers&apos; Union, the Workers&apos; Union and the Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union to join in an International Conference of agricultural workers to be held next August.Court of Inquiry.The Court of Inquiry set up under the Industrial Courts Act to inquire into the application of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a standard wage of 16s. per day and other alterations in. the conditions of dock and waterside labour, continued its sittings on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th March.
All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to : Intelligence Division,Ministry op Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W. 1.Regulation of Hours and Conditions of Employment Bill.This Bill has been prepared by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress for introduction by the Labour Party. It provides that no person shall be employed for a period of more than 44 hours during one consecutive week, nor for a period of more than 8 hours during any one clay. Employed persons are defined so as to include persons employed for the purpose of exercising superintendence. It is further provided that persons or classes of persons shall be deemed to be employed if the Minister of Labour by Order specifies that such persons or -classes of persons are employed for the purposes of the Act. Provisions are made for working overtime in case of breakdown or emergency, but this is to be conditional on agreements arrived at between the employer and the trade unions representing the workers concerned. Overtime shall be paid at the rate of not less than time and a half and in computing the overtime worked on any one day the hours worked on any other day shall not be taken into account. Penalties are laid clown for contravention of the Act, and it is provided that proceedings for offences under the Act shall be brought before a Munitions Tribunal of the second class, in like manner as for offences under the Munitions of War Acts, 1915-1917. It is also stipulated that proceedings against an employer may be instituted by, or on behalf of, a trade union, and any party to any such proceedings may appear by an&quot; officer of a trade union to which he belongs.Ex-Service Men.National Union of Ex-Service Men. Demonstrations organised by the National Union of Ex-Service men took: place in all parts of the country on the 7th inst. in support of the &quot; back pay &quot; campaign. Twelve London branches were represented at a meeting on Clapham Common, where Mr. Graham Peate, of the Commonwealth League, the principal speaker, after explaining that each man who had served 12 months was entitled to over  91, advocated conscription of the land. Taken at a 5 per cent, basis, the rental of the land in England would bring in  600,000,000 a year. They held that the first thing paid out of that amount should be the ex-Service men&apos;s back pay and afterwards the balance should be distributed to local authorities on the basis of population.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated, Society of Engineers. The Barrhead (Renfrewshire) branch of the A.S.E. has called upon its Executive to arrange with Soviet Russia suitable contracts for members of the Society who are unemployed and willing to work under the Soviet Govern-ment. Other local branches have made similar requests, influenced possibly by the reports of high, wages which are being granted in Russia.National Union of General W or her s.-This union has published an advertisement in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; appealing to all engine drivers, boiler firemen, lorry and traction enginemen, tug drivers, stokers, pipe-fitters, machinists and mechanics and all skilled and semi-skilled workers whose occupation does not require an apprenticeship, to join its craftsmen section. This attempt to enlist craftsmen in a general labour union will probably give rise to considerable friction.R. S. PIORNE.
