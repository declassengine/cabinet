No. 180.Since February, 1917, the Engineering and Foundry trades have made a practice of submitting to the Arbitration Tribunal a revision of their wages to meet the abnormal conditions due to the war. The result of previous settlements by the Committee on Production during the war and by the Interim Court of Arbitration during the period between the Armistice and the recent establishment of the Industrial Court had left the trades with war advances of 33s. %d. a week plus 12^ per cent, on total earnings. These advances by intention roughly corresponded to the increase in the cost of living. The present Award, No. 180, makes an important departure from the previous method of settlement. The Industrial Court, in giving an advance of 6s. a week, to become fully effective after the 31st May, lays down in detail in its Award the reasons for its decision.The Award begins by commenting on the present method of assessing wages in the Engineering and Foundry trades and points out that it consists of three elements a basis rate, a flat advance, and a percentage, viz., the 12^ per cent. It states that this is an emergency method of dealing with wages and is not satisfactory, but that an alteration of it is outside their reference. It then points out that, in so far as the claim put forward by the employees for an increase in wages and the claim was mostly stated at 15s. a(c 1979)  150 3/20  H&amp;S T
week was a claim based on an increase in the cost of living, no increase in wages could be given since the increase in the cost of living did not justify a payment beyond that settled by the last Award which took into account a probable rise in the cost of living during the winter a probability which has materialised. Having refused an increase on that ground the Award then goes on to say in effect that the war period is over and ordinary commercial conditions again exist. The Court is of opinion that wages should depend on the value of work done, and because they think that the present condition of the Engineering industry justifies it they decide that the operatives are entitled to an increase of 6s. a week. The position of the pieceworkers has been improved by a per-centage advance on piece rates (instead of the flat sum of so many shillings given in previous awards) and in this way, by making it worth a man&apos;s while to work on a system of &quot; payment by results,&quot; the Court have assisted in. providing an inducement to greater output.The following paragraphs from the Award state the arguments leading up to this decision : 13. To determine which of the conditions in which the trade is now working are abnormal and due to the war, necessarily calls for somewhat arbitrary judg-ment. The industry must be considered as belonging to, and forming part of, the organised activities of the community as a whole, and as affected by the changes in their direction and scope which have resulted from the war. Whilst it was properly urged on behalf of the employers that the burden left by the war must inevitably be shared to some extent by all classes, it must be borne in mind that the urgent necessity to repair by sustained and strenuous produc-tion the diminished resources of the country results, as regards many trades, in a strengthened and abnormal demand for their products.14. During the war period, when, ordinary commercial conditions were disturbed or in abeyance the cost of living&apos; was an important factor in determining wages. Now that the markets are again open it appears to the Court that an alteration in the cost of living does not in itself necessarily warrant any corresponding alteration in wages. The remuneration of the various classes of workpeople should, in ordinary circumstances, depend on the value of the work done, and the value of the work done depends on the state of the market and the demand for the products of the workshop.15. The present position in the engineering industry is abnormal owing to the great demand for engineering products in the devastated areas of Europe and in the home and foreign markets generally, due to the necessary rehabilitation of the industrial world which has been deprived in large measure of engineer -ing products during the greater part of the war period.This position is therefore one which the Court feel should be taken into account under the general wages agreement among the &quot; abnormal conditions . . . due to the war &quot; in connection with the claim made by the unions for an advance on grounds other than the cost of living.It will thus be seen that a notable departure from previous wage settlements has been made by the Industrial Court. The main determining factor in wages is no longer to be the cost of living, but the value of work done. The use of the cost of living as a basis of wages is unsound. It has long been seen that wages and the cost of living move in a vicious circle, and that one of the effects of an increase in wages to meet the increased cost of living is still further to increase that cost. If a sound industrial situation is to be created it is clear that some other basis for determining wages than the cost of living must be found, incidentally, it may be observed that a number of Trade Union, leaders stigmafse the cost of living argument as degrading ; they describe it as a &quot; fodder &quot; basis. The Industrial Court is of opinion that it is the value of the work which should determine the Wage.The effect of this test on the engineering trade is to warrant an increase. This might not, however, be the case with industries less favourably situated, and may not always be the case with the engineering trade, and if it can be shown that an industry cannot bear an increase of wages without widespread bankruptcy then to be consistent the Court would refuse to award an advance. Incidentally, the Court has already admitted this principle in an Award on a national claim for an advance in wages made on behalf of employees in gas undertakings. In this Award they differentiated between small under-takings and large, and the small were permitted to pay a smaller war advance than the large, if they so desired. The corollary of this new position is that if workpeople want more wages they must do work of more value.   This is, of course, a proposition which is
economically sound, and it is very desirable that it should be widely realised. A general admission that the value of the work is the basis of wages would break the vicious circle.From a wider point of view this Award of the Court is of unusual importance. In some trades, notably the tinplate trade, where the demand is far greater than the output, prices have reached abnormal figures, and wages have gone up in sympathy. This situa-tion will sooner or later come to an end, and when it does a demand for a decrease in wages is sure to be put forward by the employers. These demands will be difficult to settle, and it will be of advantage if, as will certainly be the case, this Award of the Court not only determines a principle for settling wages which will be applicable to cases of this kind, but also provokes a public discussion on the basis of wages and induces people to realise that diminished production involves individual and general poverty. The absence of clear ideas among Employers and Trade Union leaders in the past has been an obstacle to sound wage settlements, and unless wage settlements in the different industries are arranged on a basis which will stand alterations in economic circumstances, difficulties are bound to arise.A note will shortly be prepared on the work of the Industrial Court, but meanwhile this evident attempt of the Court to set right the wages position is worthy of the fullest attention. It demonstrates the value of an authoritative central arbitration tribunal which is able to give a national lead on questions of the utmost economic importance.part II. Departmental.Unemployed Ex-Service Men : Out-of-Work Donation.Of approximately four and a quarter million ex-Service men and women demobilised, only a little over 277,000 were claiming out-of-work donation on the 5th March,* a marked recovery in the position having taken place since the moulders&apos; strike, which at one time raised the number to over 390,000. At the end of March, however, under the provisions of the existent scheme, a fairly large number of ex-members of the Forces will have received the full amount of State assistance which hitherto has been extended to them during unemployment. Briefly stated, the position as regards out-of-work donation at present is as follows. During the twelve months following on the demobilization of any ex-Service man, he is entitled to out-of-work donation for a period of 26 weeks at the rate of 29s. a week, with allowances for dependent children, subject to suspension after 13 weeks&apos; donation has been drawn if, in the opinion of a Local Employment Committee, he does not satisfy the usual conditions. This may be followed, on approval by a Local Employment Committee, by a further grant, for not more than 13 weeks, at the rate of 20s. a week with allowances for childrenf. Towards the close of 1919, when it became apparent that a number of ex-Service men had already exhausted the full period of 39 weeks under the conditions indicated above, or had reached the close of the year during which their policies were valid, a special extension was arranged. In cases approved by a Local Employment Committee, donation might be drawn for a further nine weeks at the rate of 20s. a week without allowances for children. This extension of the scheme operates only for the period between the 24th November, 191*9, and the 31st March, 1920.At the end of March, therefore, excluding those cases where donation has been sus-pended for one cause or another by the Local Employment Committees, the donation will no longer be available for those who found it necessary to make application for the special extension for nine weeks, irrespective of the fact that they may have reached the end of the period for which the extension was available before drawing the full nine weeks&apos; grant. In addition donation will cease for men who have drawn the usual full amount of donation for 39 weeks. Further, a large and increasing number of men and women who have been demobilized for a full year will on that account find their policies no longer available. About two and three-quarter million policies will expire on or before the 31st March, and the number will have exceeded four million by the end of August. The great majority of these men are, of course, in employment, and any calculation as to the pro-portion to whom out-of-work donation would be of assistance can only be very approximate.* In addition, a small number, under 1,000 were receiving part of the donation in consequence of short -time working.i The period in the case of disabled men may be 20 weeks. Men with 20 per cent, disability who have no dependents receive 24s.(C 1979) T 2
It is believed, however, that, making allowance for the prospect of a continued improvement in employment, about 100,000 ex-Service men in any week will find themselves unemployed and unable to draw out-of-work donation. Of these, however, probably a quarter will be engaged in trades insured under the existent unemployment insurance scheme. But there will remain a number, small in proportion to the total demobilized but considerable in itself, of ex-members of the Forces unemployed, and without subsistence allowances. This position is accentuated in Ireland, where political feeling has denied to ex-Service men the sympathetic consideration which lias undoubtedly, in Great Britain, helped greatly to secure their re-employment and re-establishment in civil life. The Ministry is now considering proposals to meet this situation ; and it appears likely that such pro-posals will have to be based on a distinction between the disabled and undisabled men.Part III.-The Socialist and Labour Press. Topics of Discussion.The special Trades Union Congress, which met at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 11th March occurred too late in the week for effective notice in any of these papers. It may be judged, however, that the preoccupation of the writers in the Labour and Socialist Press with the proceedings of this Congress is the cause of their remarkable lack, this week;, of concentration upon any vital issue. The Congress may have been the real thing of interest to them, but the fact that its decisions took place between the writing of the articles and the publication of the papers prevented them dealing with it. The three topics which excite the most widespread attention are Mr. Clynes&apos; experiences in Glasgow on the 4th inst., the discussion upon financial procedure in the House of Commons on Monday, the 8th inst., and the decision of the Government to reduce the amount of the bread subsidy. Two of these topics may best be dealt with at once. The refusal of a hearing to Mr. Clynes at his meeting in Glasgow on the 4th inst. meets with universal condemnation. The approval accorded to the method by which time has been allocated for House of Commons financial business before Easter is not quite so complete. The &quot; Nation &quot; declares that there is very little in the change, which gives the House no more time for, and no more power over, financial business. This paper wants the establishment of an all-powerful estimates committee. On the other hand, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; cordially approves of the development. A leading article in this official I.L.P. journal is devoted to the subject, and upon the event is based the hope that the time is not far distant when the time table for all House of Commons business will be arranged by a permanent committee of unofficial members working in consultation with the Government.Prices.The decrease in the amount of the bread subsidy and the anticipated consequent increase in the price of bread is dealt with from two points of view. &quot; Justice,&quot; while making no defence of the subsidy, thinks that the present time is a most inopportune, one for its reduction. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, also thinks that the reduc-tion is inopportune, but this paper thinks that the increase in the price of bread, in so far as it may lead the people to realise the significance of prices, is all to the good. It is. suggested that attempts to raise wages so as to cover the increased prices are futile and the people of the country are recommended to tackle the fundamental causes that underlie the problem, and to remove the state of affairs that leaves to the workers only the ineffective-tive remedy of wage movements. The opinion of the &quot; Nation &quot; is substantially the same. A particular recommendation to the Labour Party may be noted. They are urged to study the world situation, an aspect of the problem which &quot; the Labour Party rarely handles with courage and insight.&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; dis-cusses the more general aspects of the problem. He adopts the current I.L.P. attitude that increased prices result from the war and the devastation which accompanied it, but, while I.L.P. writers of late have been somewhat passive, insisting that the world must suffer for its sins, Mr. Snowden goes further in enunciating a positive remedy for high prices. &quot; The economic reconstruction of the world can only be accomplished by increasing the volume of commodities.&quot;   &quot; An increase of wages, if accompanied by a reduction of
output, increases prices.&quot; Mr. Snowden, too, recalls with manifest approval Mr. Brownlie&apos;s statement last August, which caused much discussion at the Glasgow Trades Union Congress and in the Labour and Socialist Press at that time. The &quot; New Age,&quot; on the other hand, continues its critical commentary on current sayings and writings on this question. Last week the Press was dealt with ; this week Labour leaders are quoted. The &quot; New Age &quot; concludes that Mr. J. H. Thomas, by advocating increased production, has fallen into the trap the Government set when it &quot; undertook to increase prices.&quot; Apparently this journal believes that increased prices are the result of a deliberate policy which has for its object harder work on the part of the working classes in the production of more luxuries for the richer classes.The Socialist Movement.The discussion of the domestic problems of the Socialist movement continues, but with less intensity than in the last three weeks. The French Socialist Congress at Stras-bourg is dealt with by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward.&quot; An increasingly critical attitude on the part of I.L.P. leaders towards the Second International has been noticeable ever since the decision to postpone till August the Geneva conference of this body, which was to have taken place last February. It is therefore worthy of note that Mr. Macdonald expresses his regret at the decision of the Strasbourg conference definitely to abandon the Second International. He criticises the French conference as &quot; disorderly, dishevelled and unsatisfactory,&quot; and declares that the Second International should not be considered as past praying for. In his review of the international socialist position, Mr. Macdonald is despondent. He sees little hope of the formation of an International which may com-prise all socialists of all countries ; and apparently is preparing himself to face a period in which no socialist International will exist. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and Mr. J. T. Walton Newbold, in &quot; Forward,&quot; severely criticise a recent I.L.P. official memo-randum which has been circulated in order to assist the branches in their decisions for or against application for affiliation to the Third (Moscow) International.The &quot; Socialist &quot;has hitherto been scarcely touched by the heated discussion which has been proceeding for some time in &quot; The Call &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; on the subject of the formation in England of a United Communist Party. This week, however, it contains an article discussing, from the Communist point of view, the subject of affiliation with the present Labour Party. It is roundly declared that the S.L.P. should never sacrifice, for a mere tactical advantage, principle, consistency and truth. There also appears in this paper a letter written on behalf of the Southampton branch of the S.L.P. which deals with the whole movement towards communist unity. Messrs. Murphy, Bell, McManus and Paul are criticised for their conduct in this matter. Murphy and McManus are suspect for their association with the so-called &quot; Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Com-mittees Movement,&quot; and are especially condemned for their alleged sympathies with the I.W.W. It is insisted that the S.L.P. is and must remain a revolutionary socialist political party. This insistence upon the word &quot; political,&quot; unpopular as it has become of late in these extreme papers, is^of great interest. If it may be assumed that the opinion of the Southampton branch is typical of the S.L.P. as a whole, it may be judged that there is no immediate prospect of amalgamation between the S.L.P. clinging as it does, with almost religious fervour, to the strictest and narrowest jormulce of Marxian socialism the group of opportunists and tacticians represented by &quot; The Call,&quot; and the body of irresponsible firebrands represented by the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot;This discussion upon the internal structure of the Labour and Socialist Movement, as it is losing its intensity, would appear also to be widening its scope. &quot; The Call.&quot; and &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot;Forward,&quot; review the French Trade Union movement. &quot; The Call &quot; looks forward to the revolutionary extremists in French Trade Unionism regaining the position of authority they held before the war, while &quot; Rob Roy &quot; congratulates the Confederation Generate du Travail on the progress which it has made in recent years, by extending its membership, accumulating its funds, and pursuing a practical policy. &quot; Rob Roy &quot; points out that the French Socialists have been proceeding in a reverse direction. In the &quot; New Statesman &quot; an article appears dated the 24th February, by Herr Bernstein, who defends the Majority Socialists and their policy of coalition and evolutionary reform, as against the policy of isolation and revolution which the Independent Socialists have wished to pursue. Herr Bernstein claims that a purely Socialist community in Germany is not yet possible of achievement, and defends thei German Democratic Republic, with what he describes as a &quot; Socialist Reform Policy,&quot; against the attacks that have been made upon it in this country on various grounds.(C 1979) T 3
Government Policy.There is very little criticism of actual Government policy, apart from the decision to reduce the price of bread, in the papers reviewed this week. The Trade Union corre-correspondent to the &quot; Democrat &quot; returns to his attack upon the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, and uses this week figures which he derives from the Unemployment Insurance Fund Accounts for 1917-18 which have been recently issued. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; protests against the suggestion that the method of deducting income tax at the source should be extended to wages, and that income tax should be deducted from wages by employers by means of income tax stamps. The &quot; New Age &quot; warns the miners to beware of the new Coal Industry Bill, preliminary notices of which have recently been appearing in the Press.Foreiyn Affairs.The &quot; declaration on the economic problems of the world &quot; approved by the Supreme Allied Council on the 8th inst., which appeared in the London Press of the 10th inst.,is only dealt with in the &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; New Statesman.&quot; The opinions of these two papers on the matter are very similar. They both commend the spirit of the declaration, but complain that French opposition has resulted in the a withdrawal from the document of announcements in favour of peace with Eussia and a reconstruction loan to Germany. They both express the opinion that the duty of watching the economic condition of Europe is put entirely upon the Reparation Commission, and, pointing out that M. Poincare is to be the President of this Commission, they fear that its proceedings will be governed mainly by a regard for French interests. Hostility to French claims in these papers has become most pronounced since the trouble with regard to Part VII of the Treaty of Peace with Germany. Recent accounts appearing in the &quot; Daily News &quot; with regard to the state of affairs in Soviet Russia are used in the &quot; New Age &quot;. and by Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in order to comment on the Bolshevist regime. The comment of the &quot; New Age &quot; is that the communist Russia is becoming a servile &quot; work-state,&quot; and to the &quot; New Age &quot; this concentration upon production is an economic heresy of the worst kind. Mr. Snowdehs purpose, on the other hand, is only to show those members of the I.L.P. who are agitating for affiliation with the Third International, how mistaken is their enthusiasm. Mr. Snowden, indeed, would appear to approve of recent developments in Russia. Last week he pointed out that he had fought the Military Service Acts in this country because he was opposed not to the principle of compulsion,, but to the purposes for which the conscripted men were to be used, and that he had then affirmed that there was no logical distinction between military conscription and conscrip-tion of labour. This week he argues that increased production is vital to the Revolution in Russia and, in the peculiar circumstances of the Revolution, is prepared to defend the Soviet measures for industrial conscription. He continues, &quot; and just as it would be impossible to conduct a war without discipline and compulsion, so it may be necessary in the exceptional conditions of a revolutionary period to adopt measures which could not be defended on democratic principles or as justifiable under normal circumstances.&quot;The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and the &quot;Nation&quot; continue to devote much attention to foreign policy and the Indian and Irish questions. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; insists that the Labour Party has a heavy responsibility but also a magnificent opportunity in these spheres, while the &quot; Nation &quot; recommends Liberals to concentrate on foreign affairs, and apparently, by preserving an open mind on industrial matters, thus to make more easy Liberal-Labour co-operation.Part IV.-General Topics.The General Situation.It was not to be expected that the rejection by the Special Trades Union Congress on the llth March of the policy of direct action to secure the nationalisation of the mines would have any noticeable effect on the general situation, because no other decision was anticipated. But the vote was so decisive that it will probably ensure that on the subject of industrial action to secure political ends agitation on a considerable scale is at an end for a long time.  Interest has been transferred from schemes for the control of industry
to claims for further wage-advances. At the moment an extraordinary number of demands for increases in wages are being made in the most important industries. The miners claim an increase of 3s. per shift, and the locomotive engineers and firemen demand an advance on the standard rates fixed last August. The various claims of the National Federation of Transport Workers for large increases for dockers, omnibus and tramway workers, and commercial road transport workers are at present under discussion. In the textile trades preparations are being made to demand increases on the expiry of the present agreement, and the engineering and shipbuilding trades were last week awarded an increase of 6s. per week. The position is complicated by the fact that some of these demands are based on the increasing cost of living and others on the high profits being made in the industries concerned.Survey of Industrial Disputes.The industrial situation, so far as disputes involving a stoppage of work are concerned, has remained very quiet during the week.Two serious strikes have been settled, The Welsh steel workers agreed to resume work on the 15th March, and final terms of settlement were negotiated at a meeting of the Joint Welsh Steel Trade Conciliation Board on the 16th March. These include the concession of the 40 per cent, increase demanded by the men, and the acceptance of a sliding scale for the future adjustment of wages. A strike of clerks employed at the Cambrian Combine Collieries which took place on the 12th March, and involved 15,000 miners who ceased work in sympathy, has also been settled, and the pits are working again. The lock-out of Glasgow plumbers was settled with the assistance of the Ministry of Labour on the 15th March, the employers agreeing to observe the terms of the Ministry&apos;s Appren-apprenticeship Scheme.The Unemployment Position.There was a reduction of 15,478 in the number of H.M.F. policies remaining lodged on the 5th March compared with a reduction of 17,454 between the 20th and 27th February. The total number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged at the 5th March was 273,966 men and 3,700 women, making a total of 277,666 ; 93,037 unemployment books remained lodged on the 5th March, a figure which shows a reduction of 4,895 since the 27th February. The total of 93,037 was made up of 65,130 books lodged by males and 47,907 by females.At the 27th February 979 policies remained lodged by short time workers, of which 891 were in the insured industries (chiefly engineering) and 88 in the uninsured. At the previous week there were 1,420 policies lodged by short time workers.At the 5th March the employment exchange live registers showed 351,018 men, 52,907 women and 21,232 juveniles, compared with 369,802 men, 53,201 women and 22,030 juveniles at the 27th February and 392,604 men, 53,902 women and 23,432 juveniles at week ending the 20th February.The BuiJdiny Guild Movement.A conference representing building trade operatives was held in Manchester on the 13th March. Mr. Lewis Watson, of the Operative Bricklayers, Chairman of the Man-chester Building Guild Committee, presided, and addresses were given by Mr. S. G. Hobson and others.   According to the Press* the following resolution was passed : &quot; That this conference of duly appointed representatives of the Federation of Building Trades Operatives in the North-Western area, together with the Building Guild Committees already constituted in the North-Western area having carefully considered the urgent demand for artisans&apos; houses in the North-Western area, recommends the immediate organisation of the industry upon Guild lines throughout the whole area, by the formation of Building Guild Committees with local autonomy but affiliated to a common adminis-trative body, to be known as the North-Western Building Guild, or alter-natively, the National Building Guild, North-Western Division.&quot;The conference also urged upon all Building Guild Committees, in co-operation with the Federation and local committees of the trade unions concerned, to organise a sufficient number of building operatives of all crafts, to build 75,000 houses in the North-Western area within a period, if possible, of two and not exceeding three years.  Mr. S. G. Hobson* *&apos; Manchester Guardian,&quot; 15th March.
said that this proposal was a comparatively small one having regard to the resources of the Guild. They had to decide for themselves whether the time had come when they were prepared to undertake work collectively in the interest of the workers themselves or to go on selling their labour and leaving someone else to get the profits. A resolution was proposed by Mr. Huck (Preston) pledging the conference to use all means in its power consistent with trade union rules to bring about such a change in the spirit and organisa-tion of the building industry that the end of wage systems would be secured and the principle of self-government established. This resolution was approved. All branches of the Building Trades Federation were urged to reject all proposals for dilution, at least until the operatives were guaranteed full pay during unemployment and until all technical instruction was under the absolute control of the building trade guild and trade union organisations.The Nationalisation of Shipping.It is reported that the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union is about to take a ballot vote of its members on the question whether nationalisation shall become part of the policy of the union.The Control of the Liquor Trade.The members of the trade union and Labour movement, who visited Carlisle to examine the Liquor Control Board&apos;s experiments in that area, recently issued their report. The deputation consisted of Mr. Fred. Bramley, Assistant Secretary of the Trades Union Congress ; Mr. H. H. Elvin, National Union of Clerks ; Mr. Harry Gosling, National Transport Workers&apos; Federation ; Mr. John Hill, Boilermakers&apos; Society, and others. In their report, the signatories urged the organised Labour movement to press vigorously for the immediate extension of the principle of the Carlisle experiments to the whole country, and they express the hope that the influence of the organised Labour movement will be brought to bear upon the Government to ensure that an end be put to private ownership, and that there should be substituted for it a system based upon public ownership and full public control. The report also states that there should be adequate representation of working class organizations and of women upon Local Advisory Committees.Trades Union Congress.The special Trades Union Congress was held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 11th inst. in order to decide the action to be taken with regard to the miners&apos; demands for the nationalisation of the mines.* The Congress was robbed of some of its interest owing to the knowledge on the part of most of the delegates as well as of the general public that the decision of the Congress was a foregone conclusion. In spite of this, however, it was of much importance. Its great achievement was to put an end, for the time, to the direct action controversy which has agitated Labour and the country as a whole for the past year. It was, indeed, already apparent at the Congress in Glasgow, where direct action was practically talked out, that it was a dying cause, but the matter was not finally settled until this Congress.Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., presided over the Congress. He pointed out that the Congress had assembled not to discuss the principle of nationalisation but to decide how best to secure the enactment of a measure which they believed would be in the interests of the community. He warned the Congress of the great responsibility involved in the right to strike, and urged that it should not be exercised lightly or impulsively, and he pointed out clearly that the future position of the Labour and Trade Union movement depended on the decision of the Congress. He maintained that political action had not failed, it had not yet been properly tried. Trade unionists had not in the past used their political power as intelligently as they might. Labour had not yet returned to Parlia-ment the number of members its voting strength warranted. He, therefore, urged the Congress to adopt constitutional measures to secure their ends.Mr. Frank Hodges made a vigorous speech, but he clearly knew that he had no chance of moving the Congress, and throughout his speech there was an undertone of resentment at the failure of the other unions to support the miners&apos; claim.  He complained that in* The decision of this Congress which was known too late to be dealt with in this Report last week, was .there stated in a footnote.
certain trades he singled the woollen and cotton out for particular mention the em-ployees had not followed the lead of the miners in seeking to limit profits. He maintained that the miners had tried their best to introduce economic sanity in at least one industry, and he castigated the Congress for continuing to swim in the vortex of ever-increasing prices and wages. He maintained that their faith in the existing Parliamentary institu-tion had been shattered. The Government had failed to carry out its promises and obligations to the nation, not to the miners only, but to the whole working class. He contended that the Parliamentary institution that made them the subject of such a fraud stood discredited. He suggested that if they were to wait for Labour ib^come to power in Parliament by means of normal political change, the economic laws at work in their industry would create such industrial havoc in this country as to make them, in spite of themselves, re-act against the economic disturbance and chaos that would come upon them. He made an appeal to the working classes to sacrifice something in order to achieve the end which they desired. He pointed out that it was easy to wait for political changes, it was more comfortable, but he claimed that the working class should declare on a ballot vote whether they were prepared to put their principles to the test, even if it involved them in great personal sacrifice. Mr. Frank Hodges also indicated very clearly that if the movement for nationalisation did not succeed, the miners would be brought back into the vortex of wage claims.Mr. Tom Shaw, M.P. (Textile Workers), in a conservative speech, asked the Congress to consider the realities of the situation. Even in the miners&apos; ranks there was a huge minority against direct action. Further, the people of the country were themselves against the miners&apos; policy and if a decision in favour of direct action were reached, it would be a dangerous experiment which would recoil with tenfold force on the poor, and would set back their whole movement 20 years. He asked the Congress to decide once and for all whether political questions should be dealt with by political methods, or whether any section should decide for the country, willy-nilly, what the country should do.&apos; Mr. J. E. Clynes, M.P. (General Workers&apos; Union), in a very incisive and lucid speech, insisted that the issue was a very clear one. He disapproved of direct action, not because it might fail or because it might cause suffering but because it was wrong. He main-tained that politically a decision in favour of direct action would be welcomed by the Prime Minister, who would welcome a general election on the question of direct action to secure nationalisation because the Labour movement itself was fundamentally divided on the question. Mr. Clynes argued strongly that when a Labour Government came into power, no section of the community which thought that it was wronged would have any title to assail that Government by direct action, and what would be right in that case would be right in this. He concluded by asking the Congress to appeal to reason and not to force. Mr. Tom Mann, General Secretary of the A.S.E., in an amusing though unconvincing speech, declared that the miners had a right after the long campaign, in which they had been supported by the whole of the Labour movement, to expect the Congress to support them. The Congress vigorously applauded Mr. Mann&apos;s speech, but they voted against his policy. Mr. Jack Mills, of the Shop Stewards movement, suggested that the alternative methods of action should be referred to the votes of the rank and file, but this suggestion did not find favour. On a card vote, the voting was as follows : (a) For trade union action (a general strike)........   1,050,000Against..................   3,870,000Majority against. (6) For political action (intensive political propaganda in preparation for a General Election) Against ..     ..     .&apos;.......      ..     ..Majority for ............2,717,000The Rank and File Movement.The special Rank and File Conference convened by the National Administrative Council of Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees, an account of the first meeting of which was given in this report last week, continued in session on the 11th and 12th March. Mr. W. Gallagher, Scottish Workers&apos; Committee, who presided, stated that the conference would not be surprised at the decision of the Trade Union Congress. The trade union officials were bourgeois-minded and failed to serve the interests of the working classes. There was only one hope for the working classes and that was direct action, which simply2,820,0003,732,000 1,015,000
meant doing what was required themselves instead of waiting for others to do it for them. The conference was clearly disheartened by the decision of the Congress and little attempt was made to discuss its ambitious and elaborate agenda, an account of which was given in this report for the llth February, p. 80.The Miners&apos; Federation.At the special conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, held on the 10th March, in addition to the decision on the,question of the nationalisation of the mines, which was reported last week, other subjects, of domestic interest, were considered. On the question of the proposed increase in contributions to the Federation from Qd. to Is. per week, it was announced that the voting of the districts showed in favour of the increase 652,000, against 182,000. It may be noted that the South Wales District in ac-accordance with its latent antagonism to the larger body which has frequently been referred to, voted against the proposed increase. With regard to Mr. Smillie&apos;s resignation of the presidency, the Conference decided unanimously to appeal to him to take a lengthy jest and to reconsider his decision.On the 1.2th March, the special Conference resumed and in view of the decision of the Trades Union Congress on the nationalisation of the mines, it was decided to proceed immediately to secure an advance in wages. The executive committee also reported on their interview with the Prime Minister regarding the proposals of the Federation for reducing the price of coal, and the conference decided to accept the recommendation of the executive to put forward an application for an advance of 3s. per shift for all members of the Federation over 16 years of age, and Is. 6d. for those under that age, to date from the 1st of the present month. It was decided to adjourn the conference until the 24th March to receive the committee&apos;s report on the application.The claim made by the Federation is considered to be decidedly too moderate in South Wales, where, it will be remembered, a claim for  2 per week has been recom-mended-by the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. It would not be surprising to find that an attempt may be made in South Wales to force a departure from the national regula-tion of advances, and a return to the pre-war system of control by district prices. If such a change were made, South Wales would, of course, be in an immensely stronger position than the other districts owing to the extremely high prices now ruling in the South Wales export trade.The Railwaijmen.The railwaymen continue to be active. The executive of the A.S.L.E. and F. has made application for an advance on the standard rates fixed last August for drivers, firemen and cleaners, in order to meet the increasing cost of living,. After an interview with the Minister of Transport on the 17th August, the executive agreed to refer their application to the National Railway Wages Board which is to be set up immediately in accordance with the agreement reached in December. The constitution of this Board was detailed in this report for the 10th December, 1919, p. 572.In view of the recent instances of friction between the N.U.R. and the A.S.L.E. and F. to which attention has been drawn, it is interesting to note that steps are being taken to prevent its recurrence. A joint sub-committee of the two unions has recommended for adoption by the two societies an agreement which provides that &quot; there shall be an instruction issued that attacks upon each organization should be discountenanced by all. responsible officers and members of each union,&quot; and that in the event of any violation of the terms of the agreement, a meeting of representatives of the two unions shall,be held to discuss the matter, and that no Press or public statement is to be made prior to this investigation. The main purpose of the agreement is to ensure that joint action should be taken in all matters affecting railwaymeh, and that a common policy should be adopted in &quot;offensive or defensive action.&quot; In detail, the agreement recommends the appointment of a joint committee of six members from each union to forward the interests of the locomotivemen and electric trainmen of both unions ; and it is further provided that before a strike is declared affecting members of either organization the executive com-mittees of both shall meet to decide on the policy to be adopted.The Clapham Junction Branch of the N.U.R. has added its voice to the opposition to the decision of the executive to support the London Electric Railway Companies&apos; (Fares) Bill. With regard to this, Mr. J. H. Thomas, at a demonstration of underground workers on the 9th March explained that it would be wrong on his part to say that the public should have cheap travelling facilities at the expense of sweated railwaymen, and maintained that the railways of the country should earn sufficient revenue to meet legitimate expenses.
Amalgamation.The negotiations for amalgamation between the National Union of General Workers, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, the National Federation of Women. Workers and the Amalgamated. Gas and Municipal Workers, which have been taking place for&apos; some months are reported to be coming to a successful conclusion. The committee appointed to deal with the details of the scheme reports substantial progress. The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation is taking active steps to promote amalgamation of the two largest vehicle workers unions in the country, namely, the United Vehicle Workers and the National Union of Vehicle Workers.Trade Union Friction.Friction between, different types of trade unions and general labourers unions, several instances of which have recently been given, continues to be noteworthy. In some cases unions appear to be adopting a decidedly provocative attitude. The National Union of General Workers has published displayed advertisements in the &quot;Daily Herald &quot; appealing to builders&apos; labourers for support and attacking the policy of builders&apos; labourers&apos; unions in trying to force members of the National Union of General Workers to transfer their membership. The Workers&apos; Union has issued a circular letter stating that a concerted attack is being made by a certain type of trade union upon such unions as the Workers&apos; Union, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association and the National Amal-gamated Union of Labour. It attacks the argument that a union of building trade workers is better qualified to look after builders&apos; labourers than a mixed union, that only a miners&apos; organization can look after colliery surface workers and that a purely transport workers&apos; union can do better for tramwaymen than a union which takes in all classes of semi-skilled men. It seems clear that the growing movement in favour of industrial unionism will be strongly opposed by general labourers&apos; unions, and no doubt the matter will come up for discussion at the annual Trades Union Congress in September.International Relations of Labour.The executive of the Second International will meet at Rotterdam on the 28th March. Mr. F. Bramley has been appointed to represent the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and Mr. T. Shaw, M.P., to represent the National Executive of the Labour Party. A socialist mission composed of Dutch, Belgian and French representatives has proceeded to Berlin to discuss the future relations between the German Socialist Movement and the Socialist Movement in other countries. This mission, it is stated, will report to the executive of the Second International.The International Federation of Trade Unions at its session on the 5th and 6th March resolved to address an appeal to the organised workers of all countries, to protest against the &quot; White Terror &quot; in Hungary. A Congress of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation opened at Christiania on the 16th March. The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation has contributed a thousand pounds to assist the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions in supporting the strike of dockers and transport workers in Holland.Labour and Russia.The National Executive of the Labour Party has appointed delegates to join the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress in a commission of enquiry into political and economic conditions in Russia. The delegates of the Parliamentary Committee are Messrs. A. Purcell. J. H. Thomas, M.P., W. Thorne and Miss Margaret Bondfield, and the Labour Party delegation will be selected from Messrs. W. H. Hutchin-son, A. Henderson, B. Turner, R. Macdonald, Miss Mary Macarthur and Mrs. Philip Snowden. It is reported that the monthly district meeting of the Rhondda miners decided to stop work one day in each month as a protest against the Governments intervention in Russia and Ireland and to continue the stoppage until the whole of the troops are withdrawn from those countries.Courts of Enquiry.The Court of Enquiry appointed to enquire into the application of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a minimum wage of 16s. per day and other alterations in the conditions of labour of dock and waterside workers continued its sessions on the 10th and 11th March. Evidence on behalf of the employers concluded, The president read letters from certain Government Departments with regard to the evidence of Lord Devonport as to responsibility for the congestion in the Port of London. Sir L. Macassey and Mr. Bevin summed up for the employers and the dockers respectively. The Court then rose and an interim report is being prepared on the question of the minimum wage.
The Court of Enquiry into the hours of employment of coal tippers and trimmers continued its session on the 9th, 10th and 11th March. Evidence was given on behalf of the employees and the dock authorities.  The Court adjourned until the 29th March.Forty-Four-Hour Week.A ballot was recently taken among the employees of Messrs. Cadbury, Ltd., with respect to the arrangement of hours under a 44-hour week. The proposal for a six-day week with a free week-end once every four weeks received 3,491 votes, while the proposal for a five-day week received 3,342 votes. The majority of women voted for the former arrangement and the majority of men voted for the latter.Ex-Service Men.Ex-Service M.en&apos;s Demonstration. Under the joint auspices of the Welsh National Federation of Ex-Service Men and the National Association of Ex-Service Men, a mass demonstration of the ex-Service men of Mountain Ash, Penrhiwceiber, Abercynon and Ynysyhwl was held at Mountain Ash on the 7th inst. A resolution was carried calling for a statutory declaration of the Pensions Warrant, the formation of a joint committee of employers, trade unions and ex-Service men to devise training schemes and the formation of a joint committee to supervise the administration of all emoluments. The resolution further demanded increased war gratuities at the rate of  25 for the first year and  10 per annum for every succeeding year of war service.Officers&apos; Association. At a meeting addressed by Earl Haig at the Baltic Shipping Exchange on the 9th inst. a letter from the Prime Minister was read stating that the scheme had the entire approval of the Government. Sir Arthur Lawley, Chairman, Executive Committee, has circulated an appeal for financial support through the medium of the Press. He considers that.  3,000,000 to  4,000,000 sterling is by no means an extravagant estimate for meeting present responsibilities. Earl Haig addressed a further meeting on the 16th March at the Carlton Hotel in support of the same Association.R. S. HORNE.All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to : Intelligence Division,Ministry op Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London. S.W. 1.
