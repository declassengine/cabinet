j &apos; ^ itI (THIS gOOUMj IS THE PROPER^. OF^S BRITATOC UAJgSTY[8 GOVSRZC-rT)-CONFIDENTIAL. . QJJLU. hi t   /MEMORANDUM BY &apos;MR0 BALFOUR ON SUGGESTIONS IvIADEREFERENCE TO[ THE PEACE WITH TURKEY,la The two telegraphic messages from the Supreme Councilabout the Turkish Peace only reached the meeting of the League of Nations at the end of its sittings, and it was impossible to discuss them with any completeness, still less to pass a final judgment upon them.\2. It was however agreed Informally by Mo Bourgeois andthe rest of my colleagues&apos;, that I should attempt to give a general impression of.the difficulties, which at least a majority of them feel, with regard to the policy sketched out in the two telegrams.3. The first of these deals with Armenia, and theproposal it contains amounts to this:-   That the League of &apos; Nations should accept a position equivalent to that&apos;of a Mandatory Power.   That an (as yet undefined) Armenia should he placed under its &quot;protection&quot;, and that.it should thus provide an &quot;effective guarantee lor the future security of the proposed State.&quot;4/n The second proposal deals with minorities In Turkey,and suggests that; the League of Nations should be saddled with the same responsibilities as regards the Clauses for protecting minorities In Turkey as it has accepted with regard to the corresponding Clauses in some of. the European Treaties^5. As regards the suggestion that the League of nations should become in fact the mandatory  or Armenia it is evident that as yet, and probably for a long time to come, the League of Nations Is not and cannot be adequately equipped to carry
i343-out-duties which may well prove to be of the. juost onerous kind.   It is&apos; under-stood that France is to be mandatory in Syria; 1 Great Britain in Mesopotamia.   But these two&apos; Nations possess the resources of Great Powers, and are well aware that these resources may be seriously called upon if they are ade-adequately to fulfil their mandatory functions.     The League of Nations have no-resources, nor have they, at present the machinery for creating them,,   And there is a serious danger that if they were to undertake a responsibility, which powerful and well organised nations apparently shrink from accepting, they will break down under the strain-6. &apos; The League is of course perfectly ready to act asthe supervising authority under the mandatory system;-,    It is to it presumably that the mandatories now being called into being in various parts of the world, will be called upon to &quot; report, and we have every hope and expectation that it will exercise, where necessary, a salutary&apos;influence in the de-velopment of the mandated territories.   It is more than doubtful however whether it should itself directly undertake large res-responsibilities of a mandatory character;   especially in remote and half civilised regions where civilised opinion, the chief-weapon of the League, carries but little weights    There is no useful analogy to be drawn between the case of Armenia and the case (say) of Pantzig.
7, Somewhat similar considerations must be borne inmind when dealing with the protection of minorities in Asia Minor.    We may well hope that the League may perform most valuable functions in securing the observance of the minority clauses in European Treaties.     It will strengthen the hands of the Governments, for example at Bucharest or Warsaw, in the suppression of 16oal abuses.     It will give the minorities themselves the consciousness that there is an organised public opinion outside their own State prepared to support them*    And if unhappily abuses should arise, the machinery of the League may be quite adequate to secure their suppression,8. The position is very different in Asia Minor,Civilised public opinion has no influence whatever in that -country; - indeed since civilised public opinion is for the most part Christian opinion, it is a danger rather than a strength to Christian minorities.     Outrages against these minorities are usually inflicted by irregular bands whom the Turkish Government would immediately disavow and over whom, as they would protest, (it may be with truth), they had no power toff, control,9, The League of Nations with no force at its immediate disposal/ would have no weapon except remonstrance; and remonstrance has boon-tried in Turkey for 100 years with singularly little effect,10. Of course if Turkey is placed under a MandatoryPower the League of Nations wou^d gladly undertake the same duties with regard to that -Power that it is ready to accept with regard to other Mandatory Powers.    This is a point, however, on which the League have so far no information,11, Speaking generally it must be remembered that the
chief Instruments at tho.disposal of tho League are Public Discussion;   Judicial Investigation*,   Arbitration;   and in tho last rosort, but only in the last resort, some form of Compulsion,    &quot;Those&quot; arc powerful weapons, but the places where they scorn least applicable arc those remote and half barbarous regions, whore nothing but force is understood, and where force is useless to preserve order unless it can be rapidly apnliod.     It would scorn that in those parts/of tho world to which this, description applies the League of Nations can only play an effective part if there be a mandatory through whom it can act.     If no such mandatory can be found, it cannot, as at present constituted, play the effectual part of a substitute.12, I must repeat that I alono am responsible forthesepopinionsj   but that I believe thorn to be largely shared by my colleagues.(Initialled)   A,J,B.Paris, 15.3 * SO.
