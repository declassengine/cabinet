OF THE DOCKS IN RESPECT OP IMPORTED MEAT.The Shipping Controller refers to Memorandum C.P.838 from the Ministry of Pood,He would press his proposal that killing in this country fce stopped for a fortnight to a month as otherwise he cannot see anything but continued stagnation of shipping consequent on the enormous Import of dead meat, of which he understands there Is now in this country something like six to seven months supply.The only point that he has heard against It is dls-satls- action of farmers.    Wo market was guaranteed to the farmers and so fiar as he can learn no sympathy exists towards farmers such as Is indicated In certain quarters.Sir Joseph Maclay contends it Is the one effective way for Improvement and as the grave loss of shipping is most serious he again presses for either this or some definite action which would be the equivalent.(Signed) J. P. MACLAY.
