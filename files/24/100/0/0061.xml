hi u uf&apos;a Government&apos; om o&apos;.&apos; EEEK3SSIWATI0H   OP   THE   PEOPLS   BILL.-Memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyuI desire to urge that the Bill to whioh the Minister of Health refers in his Memorandum O.P&apos;837, Representation of the People Bill, should be opposed by the Governments      I do so for the following reasons :-It is contrary to precedent and, I think, to what is right, that when a Reform Bill has been very reoently passed into law, important and far-reaching amendments should be adopted by Parliament on the suggestion of a private Member -     the proposed additions will, I imagine, make a very considerable increase on the existing electorate, and will therefore disturb seriously the present situation^     Further than that, if we once get into a discussion of amendments to the Reform Act, we shall run the risk of raising a great many difficult questions which are for the time being laid to rest&apos;, and I cannot help thinking that a reasoned amendment moved by a private Member and supported by ,       the Government, would shelve the Bill for this Session, v/hioh may mean shelving it for good..I suggest therefore that the Minister of Health should have a carefully reasoned amendment drawn, and get a private Member to put it down.(Intlld.)    W. Ho L.12/3/30.
