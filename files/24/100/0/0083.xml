&quot;^t?^.&quot;   282[THIS DOCtEOTT IS THE PROPERTY C? HIS BHITA^IIO :,;AT-^TY;S [K^lBrl^lIZ j&apos;SECRET. Copy ITo.- u. CABINET.AGRICULTURE SILL. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.I circulate to the Cabinet the accompanying draft Bill which has been framed to give effect (so far as legislation is required) to the Agricultural Policy announced by the &quot; rime Minister in his speech at the Caxton Hall on October 21st 1919.The general scope and provisions of this Measure are more fully explained in the covering Memorandum which is printed with the Bill and are based, very largely,upon the Reports of the Selborne Agricultural Reconstruction Committee and the recent Roy-.il Commission on Agriculture.Part II., which deals with Land Tenure, embodies, in addition, the results of numerous conferences and consultations will.cn have,taken place between the Prime Minister, the Minister ,of Agriculture, and the various interests concerned - as represented by the national Farmers&apos; Union, the Central Landowners&apos; Association, the Land Union, the surveyors Institution and tne Land Agents&apos; Society.It is not suggested that these bodies entirely approve, or accept responsibility for, the details of Part II. of the Bill, but there has been a very large measure of agreement as to both principle and detail and a public-spirited endeavour&apos;on the part of all concerned to bring about an agreed settlement of an urgent but admittedly controversial problem.As time is pressing, I hope that the Cabinet will give permission for the Bill to be introduced, in the House cf Commons, before Baster.L of P.17th March,  1920.
Agriculture Bill.MEMORANDUM.This Bill consists of two main parts, of which the first contains amendments of the Corn Production Act, 1917, and the second contains amendments of the Agricultural Holdings Acts.Pari I.1. The Corn Production Act will cease to be a temporary Act, but provision is made for terminating, by means of an Order in Council, to be made on an Address presented to the Crown by both Houses of Parliament, that part of the Act which deals with guaranteed minimum prices, but subject to the condition that the Order shall not take effect until the expira-tion of the fourth year after the date on which it is made. (Clause 1,)2. The Bill proposes to amend Part I. of the Corn Pro-duction Act, which relates to guaranteed minimum prices, as follows : -(a) The existing provisions which only apply to wheat andoats are to be extended to barley.   (Clause 2):(b) Instead of the prices fixed by the Act of 1917 theminimum prices for 1920 are to be, for wheat 68s. per quarter of 504 lbs., for barley 59s. per quarter of 418 lbs., and for oats 46s. per quarter of 336 lbs. These are the minimum prices recommended by the Uoyal Commission on Agriculture and are based on. an estimate of the cost of production in 1918-19. Minimum prices for future years are to be fixed by three Commissioners and are to rise or fall in com-parison with the prices of 1920 in the same propor-tion as the average cost of production rises or falls in comparison with the cost of 1918-19. The Com-missioners are to be appointed one by the three Departments of Agriculture, one by the Treasury, and one by the Board of Trade.   (Clauses 4 and 5.)3. The provisions of s. 9 of the Act of 1917, which deal with the enforcement of proper cultivation, are amended substantially.  (Clause 6.)(a) It is proposed that the orders referred to in s. 9 shall only be made where they are &quot; not calculated to 7-7     1 A
&quot; affect injuriously the   persons  interested  in  the &quot; land,&quot; and the right of appeal to an arbitrator is provided to determine whether the order is properly ,    made.(b) A new power is given to require landlords to execute the repairs which are necessary to secure proper cultivation, and if the landlord fails to comply the tenant may be authorised by the Minister to execute the works and recover the cost from the landlord. These orders are also subject to an appeal to arbitra-tion.(c) The existing procedure in case of default in complying with cultivation orders is inadequate, and it is pro-posed that the failure to comply with a notice requiring cultivation according to the rules of good husbandry or requiring a change in the manner of cultivating land shall be an offence punishable by summary proceedings, and also that the Central Authority or any County Agricultural Committee acting on its behalf shall be entitled to execute the work and recover the cost.(d) Cases have occurred in which good husbandry and foodproduction have been prejudiced by the general mis-management of an estate, and power is taken by the Bill for the Minister in such cases on the recom-mendation of the County Agricultural Committee, and after full enquiry to make an order appointing a receiver to act on behalf of the owner with wdcle powers of management. An appeal to the High Court against such an order is included in the Bill.(e) In view of the alteration in the scope of the orders whichmay be made under s. 9 and the right of appeal provided in such cases, it is proposed that compensation shall cease to be recoverable in connection with action taken under the section, except where possession has been taken by the Central Authority.(/) Provision is made for dealing with the nuisance caused by the growth of weeds on land which cannot at present be dealt with under s. 9, as not being under cultivation, as for instance, on roadside and railway embankments.
Part II.4. The Bill proposes (clause 8) go secure tenants against the risk of eviction and consequent loss by extending the existing provisions with regard to recovery of compensation for disturbance. If a tenant is required to quit without any fault on his part, he will receive full compensation for all loss directly attributable to the quitting, together with an additional sum equal to one year&apos;s rent; if the notice to quit is given capriciously, i.e., &quot; without good and sufficient cause and for reasons inconsistent &quot; with good estate management,&quot; but in no other case, this additional sum may be increased by the arbitrator to four years&apos; rent.The Pill, without setting up a rent tribunal indirectly provides a method, convenient to both landlord and tenant, for readjust-ment of rent without the necessity of serving a notice to quit. The landlord will not be liable to pay compensation for disturb-ance if the tenant refuses to agree to an arbitration as to an increase of rent and thereby forces the landlord to determine his tenancy. On the other hand, the landlord will be liable to pay such compensation if he refuses a request by the tenant that there should be an arbitration as to reduction of rent, and in consequence forces the tenant to leave.5. Clause 10 materially improves the position of a tenant-as regards compensation for improvements. At present he- can only obtain compensation for permanent improvements if the landlord consents to their execution. Under the Bill if a landlord refuses consent the County Agricultural Committee can, after hearing the landlords case, direct that the improve-ments shall be treated as improvements for which consent is not required, but the landlord will, as in the case of drainage, have the option of executing the improvements and charging an appropriate additional rent to the tenant.As regards market garden improvements, the clause contains provisions enabling the Agricultural Committee to apply to a holding, or any part of a holding, the conditions known as the &quot; Evesham Custom &quot; under which the tenant who determines his tenancy is only entitled to compensation for market garden improvements if he can find another tenant willing to take his place and to undertake his liability for compensation.The Bill also provides for compensation where the tenant has continuously adopted a specially high standard of farming (Clause 11.)7 A 2
6. Clause 18 enables a landlord to claim arbitration in respect of dilapidations and other breaches of contract by the tenant, and in this respect puts him in the same position as regards enforcement of his claim as that in which the tenant is under the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1908.7. In addition to the amendments specifically mentioned above, Part II. of the Bill comprises various other amendments of the Act of 1908, of a more technical character, which are desirable for improving the legal position as between landlord and tenant.Part II. is framed generally on the lines suggested by the Reconstruction Committee over which Lord Selborne presided.
