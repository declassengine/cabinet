Si. Military Secret. 132286S     )*)V/j y ffitity^iceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, llth March 1920.(Eieceiyed 12th.)3345. Malleson wires 9th March : &quot;I have to-day received two friendly letters from Amir of Bokhara, dated 16th January. Purport of them is that he and people of Bokhara are in great difficulty at the present time ; that he is so shaping his course as to avoid giving Bolsheviks any excuse for violence; that nevertheless hatred of Bolsheviks which he and his people formerly bore remains strong as ever; that he hopes that I shall bear these facts in mind always, and discount most of the stories about Bokharan friendship with Bolsheviks as false. He says he is convinced of my genuine friendliness for Bokhara, and asks for my views as to probable course of Bolshevik rule and policy. He says that Afghan overtures to him are primarily of &apos; anti-Bolshevik nature, and that in no conceivable circumstances will his friendship for us be disturbed.&quot;
