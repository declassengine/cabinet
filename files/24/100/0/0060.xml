,M n) 0*% g*238PROTECTION DURING INDUSTRIAL DISTURBANOISn,060Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary for Scotland,Following on tho conclusions of the Prime iviini8tor&apos;s conference of 2nd February on tho above subject, it appears desirable to have a clear under-standing as to the nature of tho responsibility now plaoed upon the Home Seoretary-and the Secretary for Scotland,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff recommended on 12th November that &quot;in case of industrial trouble all protection duties and assistance to the &quot;civil power be found by the Police assisted, where necessary, by suoh organisa-&quot;tions as Special Constables or Citizen Guards&quot;.    this recommendation was approved by the Cabinet Conference on 18th November.    On 24th December, the Home Secretary laid before the Supply and Transport Committee a report which he said &quot;seems to show that in the event of an organised strike on a large soale &quot;it will not be possible to depend for effective protection on the Police aided &quot;by the Special Constabulary&quot;.On 7th January the Seoretary of State for War circulated a memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in whioh it is suggested that &quot;the &quot;Civil Departments have not yet appreciated the extent of the responsibilities &quot;plaoed upon them and continue to   look to the Army for assistance, which it is&quot;quite beyond its power to afford..........     Not only will the Army be unable ,&quot;to find the guards for which it has been up to now responsible, but als** it &quot;will be far too weak to give the full measure of assistance to tho Police &quot;necessitated by a disturbance on a large scale&quot;.Following on the above, and upon discussions in the Supply and Transport Committee and at the Conference of 2nd February, It would appear that the departments traditionally responsible for law and order, viz., the Home Office and the Scottish Office, are left to do the best they oan with military assis-tance limited to cases of actual disturbance.     The Homo Seoretary and Seore-tary for Scotland do not desire to disclaim responsibility, but they must adhere&apos; to the view that, whatever development may be given to the Special Constabulary movement, the resources at their disposal, or, in other words, the Police and Special Constabulary, are by no means, an adequate substitute for the military protection which made it possible to deal with the Railway Strike so effeotive-ly.    As stated in the minutes of the Conference of 2nd February - &quot;A great &quot;impression had been made on the public the last time by the perfection sf the &quot;Government&apos;s organisation, and it would be very serious if in the next strike &quot;the Government did not live up to that high standard&quot;.It seems necessary to place on record that, so far as protection goes,the arrangements now contemplated do not permit of the expectation that theGovernment will live up to the standard set in 1919.    While everything will bedone to encourage the enrolment of Special Constables, it must be stated thatthe responsibility   of the Home Secretary and the Secretary for Scotland is necessarily limited to.the utilization of the resources placed at their disposaland that the decision not to increase the Armed Foroes of the Crown in thisCountry so as to afford the same protection as was given last year is one inwhioh all their colleagues share. 11th March, 1920.
