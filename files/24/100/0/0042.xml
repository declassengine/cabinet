Note by the Chanoellor of the Exchequer.With reference to the telegrams exchanged between theBritish Embassy at Washington and myself which I recently circulated to the Cabinet (CP.-597) I now circulate a copy of a further telegram which I have received from Mr. Houston, the new Secretary of the U.S.Treasury, and a oopy of niy reply.REASURY, SYW.March 11th, 1920.(Intd.)   A.C.
Decypher of telegram from Mr- Lindsay (Washington)tc Foreign Office, Despatched   March 5th, 1920c Received      10.45 a&apos;.nu   March 8th, 1920.No.177. (D), .i.-----oOo-----Following fronl Secretary of Treasury for Chancellor of the Exchequer.Your recent message through British Embassy in&apos; which, amongst other things, you suggest a general can-collation of Inter-Governmental War Debts has been received and Rathbone has transmitted a copy of communica-tion sent to him by Blackett dealing with funding of (? overdue) obligations of Allied Governments held by United States and England respectively In which same subject is raised.I concur with your view that financial and economic problems of all the world are closely connected and that Great Britain and United States naturally look with concern upon the difficulties which confront continent of Europe,United States Treasury has been greatly interested in the information reaching it concerning the situation of Great Britain and has viewed with pleasure and satis-faction the progress which your Government has been making towards a return to a peace basis-.    While we are at present confronted with difficult problems our-financial
financial situation is not at all critical.   On the con-trary it Is such that I have reason to think that credits from private sources may be available to Con-continent of Europe on sound and adequate security and on terms which recognize the world wide shortage of capital resulting from five years of warfare.Funding of short term obligations is a matter as to which no question has been raised by our Congress and there should be no difficulty in dealing with this phase of the proposed arrangements in the manner outlined by Mr. Rathbone.      As you have no doubt heard from Mr. Rathbone it may be impossible to reach, without Congress approval, a final settlement in respect to interest ac-cruing during next two or three years.I regret conditions are such as to cause you con-cern in respect to Anglo-French loan maturing this fall and sincerely hope you will have no difficulty in making satisfactory arrangements to take care of it.As to engagement of British Government in respect to advances for purchase of silver under Plttman Act this matter is being dealt with by Mr. Rathbone who undoubtedly will give full consideration to any proposal you have to make in that connection.     It is unfortunate that Indian Government has not seen fit to take steps to limit im-portation of gold into India.Failure to do this is making heavy debts (sic) on our gold reserves.   If continued, this is likely materially to impair the ability of our financial markets to assist Europe.As to general cancellation of inter-Governmentalwar
war debts suggested by you. you will, I an sure, desire that T present ray&apos; views no loss frankly than you have presented yours-    Any proposal or move of such character would, T am confident, serve no useful purpose.   On the contrary it would, T fear, mislead people of debtor countries as to the justice and efficacy of such a plan and arouse hopes, the disappointment of which could only have harmful effect.     I feel certain that neither American people nor our Congress, whose action on such a question would be required, is prepared to look with favour upon such a proposaloApparently there are those -who have been labouring for some time under the delusion that the inevitable consequences of war can be avoidedo    As1 far back as January a year ago, before it could&quot;possibly be foreseen whether any measures were necessary other than the adoption of sound economic policies, various schemes, in-cluding that of a cancellation of Inter-Governmental war debts, were launchedo     Of course, I recognise that a general cancellation of su6h debts would be of advantage to Great Britain and that it probably would not involve any losses on her part.    As there are no obligations of United States Government which would be cancelled under such a plan, effect would be that, in consideration of a cancellation by United States Government of obligations which It holds for advances made to British Government and other Allied Governments, prltish Government would cancel its debt against France, Italy/ Russia and other Allies.     Such a proposal &apos;does not involve mutualsacrifice
sacrifice on the part of nations concerned,-,     It.....simply.,involves a contribution mainly by United States.   UnitedStates has shown its desire to assist Europe*     Negotiationsfor funding principal of foreign obligations held by united States Treasury and for postponing or fundingtinterest accruing during reconstruction period are in pro-gress*     Since Armistice (? United States Government, omitted) has extended to foreign Governments financial assistance to extent of approximately four billions of dollars *   What this Government could do for immediate relief of debtor countries has been done.     Their need now is for private creditsr.     Indebtedness cf Allied Governments to eaoh other5 to United States, is not a present burden upon debtor Gov-ernments since they are not paying interest or even, as far as I am aware, providing in their V-uVjcts or taxes for payment cf either principal or interest *     At present time foreign obligations held by United States Government do not constitute a practical obstacle to obtaining credits here and I do not think European countries would obtain a dollar of additional credit as a result of cancellation of those obligations,-.   Proposal does not touch matters cut of which present fincancial and economic difficulties of Europe chiefly grow.-.     Relief of thoir present ills, in so far as it can be obtained is primarily within the control of debtor Governments and peoples themselves.   Most cfdebtor Governments have not levied taxes sufficient toyenable them to balance their budgets nor have they taken any energetic and adequate measures to reduce their ex-penditure to meet their income *     Too little progress has been made in disarmament.     No appreciable progress has beenmade
made in deflating excessive issues of currency or in stabilising (*? currencies) at new levels but in-Continent of Europe there has been a constant increase in note issuer Private Initiative has not been resLored.   Unnecessary and unwise economic (? barriers) still exist.     Instead of setting trade and commerce free by appropriate steps there appear to be concerted efforts to obtain from most needy (group undecypherable)-ory advantages and exclusive con-cessions.   There is not yet apparent any disposition on the part of Europe to make a prompt and reasonable definite settlement of reparation claims against Germany or to adopt policies which will set Germany and Austria free to make their necessary contribution to the economic rehabilitation of Europe.After taking all the measures within their power, one or more of debtor Government may ultimately consider it necessary or advantageous to make some general settlement of their indebtedness.     In such a case they would, I presume, propose to all creditors, domestic and foreign, a general composition which would take into account advantages ob-tained by such debtor countries under Treaty of Peace.     How American people or American Congress would view participa-tion in such a composition I cannot say.   It is very clear to me however that a general cancellation of Inter-Governmental war debts, irrespective of positions of separate debtor Governments, is of no present advantage or necessity.-A general cancellation as suggested would, while retainingy -domestic obligations intact, throw on people of this country exclusive burden of meeting interest and ultimately of extinguishing principal of our loans to allied
Allied Governments.     This notion has neither sought nor received substantial benefits from war*     On the other hand Allies, although having suffered greatly in loss of life and property, have, under terms of treaty of peace and Otherwise,, acquired very consider-able accessions of territories, populations, economic and other advantagese     It would therefore seem that if a full account were taken of these and of whole situa-tion there would be no desire nor reason to call upon Government of this country for further contributions *(9.3.   8-4).
n.Reply to telegram Wo. 17*7 from Mr. Lindsay, dated March 5th, 1920.Following from Chancellor of the Exchequer for the Secretary of the Treasury. Washington:-I am much obliged for the full and in tore s&quot;ting--reply which you have been go*d enough to make to my message to Leffingwell.I fully appreciate attitude of United States to any proposal for mutual cancellation of International Warindebtedness.   I had no intention of renewing this proposal to which I referred only in order t9 respond fully to Leffingwell&apos;s request for my appreciation of general situation of Europe as well as of this country.I am happy to.say that conversations with Marsal since I cabled to Leffingwell have entirely relieved my anxiety as to Angle-French Loan and enabled us to make joint announcement in terms already published.    As regards debt to UoS.Government I will await further communication from Rathbone when he is in a position to make it.I do not wish to add anything to what I said before regarding Kttman silver.   As to India&apos;s demand for gold the whole question of Indian currency is a most complicated one and has recently been reported upon by a Commission., of high com-petance.   A copy of their report has been sent to Rathbone and another shall be mailed to you.     But India is a creditor country and unfortunately her people are not sufficiently educated to take payment by Investing abroad but require cash for their products so that it is difficult to see any alternative to payment in specie.You/
You will doubtless hove seen declaration of&quot;&apos; Supreme Council on eoonoraic conditions of Europe.   I believe that its contents are such as will oomtexid your approval.     You will note in particular that Supreme Council emphasises necessity of re-establishment of peace and return to normal economic conditions, cessation of Government borrowing except for capital expenditure on reconstruction, deflation of credit and of currency, and that it expresses wish for early determination of liability of Germany and readiness of Powers represented to allow Germany to obtain credits required for subsistence of her people and restarting her industry.   You will I hope feel that Supreme Council was alive to considerations stated in your message and has shown the serious intention of the Powers represented to apply the appropriate remedies.May I add that I shall always welcome opportunities for a frank exchange of views on problems in which our countries have so large a common Interest..
