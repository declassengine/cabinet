CP. 838 I(This Document is the Property of *His Bntanriir. M-majesty&apos;^ GovVnmetifc)CABINET HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE,3 mc0rkONGESTION OF THE DOCKS IN RESPECT OB1 gPOgjgg MEAT, &quot; MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTRY OF FOOD.If   The pre-war consumption of imported meat in this country was approximately 700,000 tons per annum, or 14,000 tons per week. The consumption of imported meat during the last nine weeks has averaged 11,500 tons, the highest figure being 13,000 tons for any one week.   Last week the consumption was just over 11,200 tons.2,   It isterminationconsidered desirable that the stock, on hand at the of control should be not less than 100,000 tons in order that the stocks of imported meat may exercise a restraining influence on the markets for meat as a whole,,   On this assumption tho immediate surplus of imported meat may be taken at not less than 73,000 tons, and may possibly be more unless the rate of consumption bo increased.5Y  The maximum amount of imported meat which has been distributed in any one week by the Ministry of Food through&apos;internal transport has only slightly exceeded 14,000 tons   This is very close to the pre-war average *   Under present transport conditions it is most doubtful if this figure could be at all increasedo   Clearly the consumption in any case cannot be stimulated beyond the transport facilities.4.   The present price is not at all excessive In comparison with the present prices of foodstuffs generallyo   Any marked reduction will create a very artificial price which cannot of.course be maintained later In the year.   The surplus stocks are of an abnormal age coming under abnormal circumstances and the difficulty can only be met by abnormal measures.   No mere modification of normal trading methods will meet the difficulty.5* There would appear to be only two methods of dealing drastically with this surplus which is congesting the docks;(a) to divert 50,000 tons or possibly more tothose European countries which,are reported to be in urgent need of additional foodstuffs, provided, of course, that either finance or credit can be found by those countries,(b) to reduce the prices, with a view to stimulating consumption.   Any such reduction in wholesale price -should be accompanied by the removal of maximum retail prices in order to give the retailer every incentive to push the consumption of this meat.   It may be tentatively suggested that if the prices were modified to 7d. per lb. for mutton and l/- per lb. for lamb, sufficient attraction would be offered*   In fixing the wholesale price regard should be paid to the replacement value to avoid a reaction in prices later in tho year.   The Board of Trade can alone inform the Treasury what loss will fall upon the Exchequer by the suggested reduction in price.Perhaps it would be well to adopt both methods concurrently.11th March 1920.CHARLES A. McCURDY.
