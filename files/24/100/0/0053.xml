The j? 6 ao a TTo nfar a no e.&apos;   MINIS THY tfOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,-BERLIN., -March 7, 1920.Your Excellency..On behalf of the German Government, and in reply to theletter of February 1$addressed to the Chancellor of the Empirewith regard to penal proceedings against Germans whom the AlliedPowers accuse of violating the laws and customs of war, I beg to&apos;submit the-following, observations to Your Excellency, viz:-Immediately on reoeipt of the letter dated February from the President of the Peace Conference, the German Governmentsubmitted to the head of the parquet of the Supreme Court ofLeipzig - who is an authority on the matter - the list attachedto such letter, in order that the necessary measures should betaken which are required by the Law of December 18, 1919 con-cerning the legal prosecution of war crimes and war offences..In view of the fact that the Allied Powers have signified their agreement with regard to procedure before the Supreme Court as stated in such iLaw, the German Government has (in accordance withits declaration made in the Note of January 25) submitted to thelegislative authorities the draft of a Law supplementing that ofDecember 18, 1919, .which has Just been voted by the national assembly in the form of the annex hereto-     This Law removes alllegal obstacles which, being, created by an amnesty, by procedure,or by previous decisions., might forbid consideration of theHis Excellency.,David Lloyd George Prime Minister of Great Britain.
charges contained in the list.... ubmittoa.....byJtha...JXLiocL Power.Furthermore, this lav; lays down that the Supreme Court alone shall determine the suspension or resumption of proceedings, no decision in the matter being permitted, to any court in any degree dependent on Instructions from higher powers *The new Law makes alterations in the fundamental principles of current Law, in order to comply.with the provisions of Articles 228 to 230 of the Treaty of Peace, without removing the Germans concerned from their national jurisdiction,   She provisions set forth give all possible legal guarantees for impartial and thorough consideration of the charges brought by the Allies.   It is true that, in several cases, the action to be taken will depend on the production of documents by the Commission set up by the Allied Powers, but this is solely owing to the fact that the lists submitted often give no indication of definitely indictable acts nor of proof thereof,     In any event the matter is now, Owing to the coming into force of the new Law, outeicie the sphere of influenoe of the German&quot;Government *     It has been entirely handed over to the judicial authorities and cannot proceed otherwise than in. accordance with the&apos;law*The point of view of the German Government regard-ing the reservations made by the Allies in their letter 1of February 13 is, therefore, quite clear.     The Allies reserved the powor to employ - in the measure and form which they may judge suitable&apos; - tho rights accorded to them by the Treaty of Peace, in the event of non-fulfil-ment of the obligations resulting thereunder,     They furthermore stated that no procedure before the German courtswould annul the provisions of Articles 228 to 230
cf the Treaty cf Peace, and that they would have to decide-whether the proposed procedure by Germany would not have the effect of bringing about the escape of per-sons accused from the just punishment of their crimes. Finally, they reserved the right, in this event, of exercising their right a to their full extent by sub-mi t ting the cases to their own tribunals.The German Government wishes to place cn record that such considerations cannot carry any weight with regard to German legal procedure.   The Supreme Court -which must take proceedings solely on the basi3 of German laws and in no wise according to the instructions of foreign Governments - cannot, if it is to keep faith with its own high traditions, allow itself to be guided by other considerations than that of satisfying the claims of lav/,   it will pronounce judgment without regard to persons or to political consequences.   It can, therefore,  rest assured that the entire civilised world will acknowledge the justice of its award.in this regard,  the German Government considers at right to bring forward two further questions.The Allies have frequently arrested and brought before their courts German nationals in German terri-tory occupied by their trocps, both during the armistice and after the signature of peace.   These arrests have assumed surprising proportions during the last few weeks.   The   persons arrested are accused of offences said to have been committed during the war or by reason of the same, such offences being legally similar to the indictments set forth in the listsi   The German Government considers that those measures - which
werer&apos;-oarri^^-oirt&apos;&quot;&apos;*T3y&apos;&apos;&apos;th.e--occupying authorities andsirrcngly resented by the German nation - were justifiedtheneither by the armistice conditions nor toy^rp visions if the Treaty of peace, but rather that they obviously exceed the powers of the armies of occupation.   Without emphasising the legal aspect of the question the German Government wishes to point out that the decision of the Allied Governments, as stated in their communica-tion of February 13 last, is difficult to reconcile with the fact that Germans have been haled before foreign courts for the sole reason that they were within reach of the Allied armies, whereas other Germans similarly accused come under the jurisdiction of German courts.   The German Government therefore considers itself justified in asking that the Allied armies of occupa-tion should no longer make any such arrests and that the Allied Governments should hand over the Germans already arrested for trial by them (in accordance with the   Law of December 18, 1919), whether their names are contained or not contained in the list already sub-mi t ted.Further, all Germans now detained in captivity by-reason of charges of the kind referred to above should be repatriated.The German Government intends to communicate immediately to the Governments concerned cases which have already come to its notice, and leave it to the Allied Governments to forward to it the dossiers connected with these matters.It is,  furthermore, evident from the contents of the Note dated February 3   from the Pr&amp;aiiecb of the Peace Conference to the Chairman of the German Delegation in Paris, that the Allied Governments do not intend to bring
under the amnesty-those-Germans who may have-committed crimes during the war and who have not been included in the list submitted, but intend to bring them before their own courts if found 021 Allied territory.   Indeed, the Versailles Treaty of Peace does not - contrary to most modern treaties of peace - provide for reciprocal amnesty. The question arises, however, whether the position   so created, which allows, inth&apos;    parties reciprocally to hold responsible their respective nationals, will nit give rise&quot;tcrconsequences incompatible with the preliminaries for peace relations among the nations.   The time has now come to consider whether, side by side with the meceesity for punishment,there does not now arise another necessity, that of allowing those acts of war whose chastisement is not imperatively called&apos;for by the universal sense of justice, to fall into oblivion upon the return to a state of peace.   The re-establishment of normal relations between the nationals of either party is hardly possible if the Allies definition refuse1 Ivoluntarily to limit their power of penalisation in this respect and if they thus make it necessary for the German Government, for its part, to take measures with regard to indictable acts committed during the war by Allied..nationals against the nationals of Germany.I have the honour to be,  etc. (Sgd..).

EIIOLQaUKE TO C.P.6S9 TRANSLATION from GormanAdditional lav; to the Law of Deo ember 18, 1919, for the Prosecution of War Crimes and War Offences; (&quot;Federal Gazette&quot;, p. 2125).The German legislative National Assembly has passed the following Law, which is hereby promulgated with the consent of the Roiohsrat:-Article a *In all cases in which an accusation is brought bythe Allied Powers in virtue -of Articles 228 to  30 of1the Treaty of Peace and Par. r6 of the Final protocol of Juno 28, 1919, the following provisions shall apply with respect to the proceedings, in conformity withthe Law for the prosecution of &apos;7ar Crimes and War offences of December 18, 1919 (Federal Gazette, p.2125):- &apos;81.Should the Chief Public prosecutor be of opinion that there are not sufficient grounds for public prosecution, ho shall submit the documents relating to the case to ths First Criminal Chamber of the JM&amp;oral Supreme Court with an application for suspension of the proceedings.Should the Criminal Chamber decide upon suspension/Iof the proceedings, its decision must be accompanied by a ft. v a soiled statement, setting forth tho considerations fjo facto and de jure upon which its decision is based. The decision shall.be notified to the accused.In the event of the Criminal Chamber refusing the application, it shall order public proceedings to be taken.
In order to obtain a bettor appreciation of the matter in hand, tho Criminal Chamber may order the pre-liminary investigation to bo carried further or, should no such preliminary investigation have taken place, may order an enquiry to bo openod or further evidence to bo taken.The Law of December 18, 1919 contains nothing in-compatible with granting amnesty, with the prescription or limitation of criminal proceedings, or with preliminary investigation.If the accused is legally acquitted in the prelimi-nary investigation, the First Criminal Chamber shall or-der a resumption of the proceedings at the instance of the Chief Public Prosecutor, in the event of the case against the accused being, sufficiently strong.     The same shall apply when, as&apos; a result of preliminary invest.!-gations, a sentence has been pronounoed which is obvious-ly disproportionate to the heinousness of the offence.Should the preliminary investigation have resultediin a decision which admits cf no further dispute, theproceedings shall be resumed in the event of the case against the accused being sufficiently strong.Should resumption of the proceedings or investiga-tions not appear advisable to the Chief Public Prosecutorhe must procure tho i .el?r&apos; on Af the First Criminal Chamber,in conformity with the previsions of 8 i.8 3. pThe Federal Supreme. Court shall have exclusive competence to try the proceedings, even such as were already pending at the davte of the coming into, force cf the Law of December 18, 1919; should the case be pending before a court of law,the
