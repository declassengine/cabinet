Erzeroum to be included in the Armenian StateeThe British High Commissioner considers that the severity of these terms may result in (1) Refusal to sign or ratify the treaty, or to execute it if-ratified, (2) Rising of the whole of the Turkish elements *The/
The situation at Ilovorossisk is serious. ;.-The Military Governor has reported that the Russian Army is practically non-existent,   many are entering into relations with the &quot;Greens&quot; to ensure their own future, and it is considered o,fit &apos;e possible that the &quot;Greens1- may take the town without serious opposition.A Conference was held, on the morning of inarch 9th, present at which were Admiral Seymour, General Percy, General Keyes, the Military Governor-and General Holman.     General Keyes reports that General Denikin does not realise the strength of the uGreen&quot; iuovement or the demoralization of the Volunteer Army.   GeneralDenikin1s/The situation in Constantinople is serious and very urgent.        Steps:; are &quot;being token to strengthen the Allied position, as by showing a strong front at the commencement, it is hoped that the chances of over-awing any resistance will be greatly enhanced.     British Battalions are sailing from home on 18th and 28th inarch.     A Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment has been diver-ted from Egypt and is cue at Constantinople March 13th.   Further re-inforcements, including 2 Indian Battalions, are being sent from Egypt *There are at present at Constantinople 8 Battleships, 1 Light- Cruiser, 10 Destroyers, 3 Sloops and 1 Seaplane Carrier.Arrangements have been made to land 2,000 men from the Fleet, the operation to include occupation of the Ministries of War and Marine, the establishment of necessary controls and certain arrests.These preparations were completed, by 12th.On 11th March the French High Commissioner received a telegram from his Government insisting on the necessity for ripe reflection and advising delaying action until the proposals of the High Commissioners had been considered by the Governments concerned.Under these circumstances Admiral do Robeck asked (12.5.20), for instructions and to be given authority to order the occupation to proceed.A telegram sent by the Foreign Office to.Admiral de Robeck (p.m. 15.3.20; informed Mm that the instructions already sent him       had been approved by the Supreme Council, and that if the other High Commissioners would not agree General Mine was to proceed with the occupation of Constantinople on his own authority.No news has been received subsequent to a telegram (14.3.20) from Admiral de Robeck to the effect that the date of the occupation has been postponed.General Franchet d&apos;Esperey returned to Constantinople 11.3.20. thus raising the question of command of the army of occupa-tion.   Mien delimiting spheres of command after the Armistice, Constantinople was treated as part of Asia Mnor and therefore came under General Mine&apos;s command.The intention is to resist any claim by General Franchet dfEsperey to take command, though as he is Commander of the army of the Orient he can put up a good case.   The essential thing is to give General Mine sufficient forces to make it unnecessary to ask for French assistance, as such assistance would certainly be made a pretext for claiming the command.On February 19th Turkish troops threatened to use force to prevent a movement of British troops from Iamid.   British cruisers and infantry reinforcements arrived next morning, and a notification was given simultaneously to the Turkish troops at If mid and to the Turkish Kinister of war at Constantinople that superior force would be used unless the Turks complied immediately with orders.    The Turks thereupon capitulated.   This incident shews the attitude of the Turks and the necessity of having sufficient strength with which to cope with it.Ilovorossisk.
Denikin*s plan of allowing Volunteers to retire on Crimea, and, by himself withdrawing to the Coast to secure the Black Sea Province, waj not considered practicable as his force would be too small.    The      % scheme would merely result in useless con lict wit&apos;?. &quot;Greens&quot;.General Keyes considers that we cannot allow General Denikin and his staff, with whom we have worked so long, to be hunted down and probably murdered as Kolchak was, and that we should j:. inform General Denikin that H.k. Government regret the issue of the gallant struggle, but cannot afford any assistance or countenance      h aggressive operations against &quot;Greens&quot;, whom, we cannot consider as Bolsheviks, but that we are prepared t-o inform &quot;Greens&quot; If they will J not undertake to refrain from attacking Novorossisk until we have completed its evacuation, that we will assist Denikin to defend the    I town* I1Refugees .Colonial Office has now consented to receive 1,000 refugees in Cyprus when Turkish prisoners are repatriated. This camp 1 is available for 4,000 persons, and Admiralty view is that more than 1 1,000 could be received.   It is understood that Greek Government        J has now also consented to    tablish a camp for 1,000 refugees at Salonika.     General Keyes wires that all families in Ekaterinodar and Novorossisk, covered byJviackinder&apos;s guxnantee, have been given the chance of going.   3,300 persons have declined to sai] without the men, and most of Ekaterinodar families stayed there for some reasonj there remain/500 in Tuapse, Anapa and Armavir.The evacuation of ilovorossisk could, by agreement with j the &quot;Greens&quot; be spread over several weeks and probably be deferred until the Allies could make arrangements for the reception of the refugees *CASPIAN.Minister of Foreign affairs, Azerbaijan, is&apos;anxious to take over ex-Russian gun-boats   ASTRABAD&quot;, &quot;KARS&quot; and &quot;ARDAHAN&quot; now at Baku, and says that with the assistance of British personnel they could be manned.There Is no late news of the movements of the Volunteer Ships in.the Caspio.n.&quot;GRETSIA&quot; is still at Enzeli.   Her guns could be mounted on shore for the defence of that port, but so far as is known, no orders have been given her by Denikin*General HoMan has been told to make it clear to Denikin that his ships can only remain at Enzeli under the conditions already laid down (the chief of which is that tho ships are to be turned over intact to British Control) and to instruct him to issue orders to &quot;GRETSIA&quot; either to comply with these   conditions   or leave Enzeli.CHINA.Commander-in-Chief in &quot;ALACRITY&quot; leave Hong, Kong 13th March to visit Treaty Ports and is due at Shanghai about 31st March.ITALY.In the presence of Allied destroyers Italian loyalist troops occupied Zara on Iv.arch 2nd.D^mnunziots troops thereupon left immediately and returned to Piume.

The opposition of Belgium is directed principally against the political part of the treaty.   In addition it is stated that Belgium cannot recognise complete Dutch sovereignty over the waters of the Scheldt, and thus establish the position which existed prior to 1914.     This decision of the Cabinet has caused a great sensation in Belgium.
