All sections have been waiting for the Trade Union Congress and though there have been threats of two important strikes of transport workers, the men did not come out.It is rash to foretell the voting at any Labour meeting but the indications point to a substantial majority against direct action.   If this takes place there will at once be a demand for increased wages and if this cannot be met by a reduction in the cost of living strikes will become inevitable.It is reported that Mr. Smillie has resided the Presidency of the Miners1 Federation owing to ill health.The Labour world is no longer unaffected by events in foreign countries.   The formation of a Government in Sweden by Monsieur Branting may set an example of constitutional action in this country.The Sinn Peiners in Great Britain have been comparatively quiet.   In London they are preparing for the celebration of St. Patricks Bay.There ara various indications that the violent element of Sinn Fein are meditating a rising during the next few weeks. April 5th has been mentioned but quite possibly the date may be postponed until more arms are available.
THE TRADE UNIONS congress the Congress is now sitting.   It is rash to make any forecast as to voting in Labour matters, but the indications seem to show that on a card vote some two million votes may be cast for Direct Action and some four millions against it.   The large proportion of votes will come from the miners and the engineers: perhaps a quarter of the transport workers and railwaymen combined may vote for Direct Action.Probably the Cleveland and Durham Associations of miners will be the only opponents of Direct Action.   in wales, 143,850 out of a total of 210,000 voted for it.The delegates were also instructed to make an immediatedemand for an increase of  2 a week, but on this pointthere was a majority of only 3750.   There is still sometalk among the extremists in the coal-fields of a revolution at an early date and of the setting up ofSoviets in Wales,   to.&apos; W. R. Ray; President of the SouthWales Socialist Society,&apos; showed my correspondent anundated letter from Lenin and Trotsky, which contained thefollowing passage;&quot;Greetings from the Russian Soviet Workers Republic to our Comrades the South Wales Miners Socialist Society, congratulating you on the pamphlet received.   It is the finest work, we have read on coal and wish you&apos; ali success in your glorious fight for the Proletariat.&quot;The Ruondda Industrial Committee of the South V/alesSocialist Society circulated on March 3rd a letteroutlining their attitude to nationalisation:&quot;While;we enter a protest against the form of nationalisation proposed (which has never been discussed by South Wales Conference) yet we think as a tactical move we should vote for this proposal to go forward, since any movement of this kind which might lead to general action by the Trade Union Movement, apart from its object, cannot but weaken the Government and provide us with further opportunities.&quot;
It is common talk among tbo miners that if the Trade Unions Congress, decider against striking for Uationalisati the Federation will at once demand an increase of wages, &amp; the feeling is growing that it would be more satisfactory strike for wages than for a political issue.   The vote * of the Durham miners showed a majority of 39 in favour of constitutional action as opposed to direct action.   My Deed correspondent reports that the Textile Workers and the Cotton Trade Unions have&quot; issued statements to their branches opposing direct action for nationalisation of the mines.   The General Workers1 Union has decided in the same sense.Speaking generally, it may be said that more interest is taken in football than in nationalisation.   Even among the miners many are against a strike and others want to give their delegates a free hand.They do not expect much from the Congress on Thursday which has been so industriously advertised. They have been worked up so often during the last fourteen months and they are tired of the stories they read in the &quot;Herald&quot; about th imminence of dramatic events.My correspondent at Coventry reports that the propagaB1 against state control, led by Mr. William Johnson, J.P., President of the Warwickshire Miners&apos; Federation, has had considerable influence:   apparently the miners in that ares would gladly sacrifice nationalisation for higher pay. Some of them are asking whether one mine might not be nationalised as a test whether coal could not be produced at a cheaper rate to the consumer.THE/
HTfjR., I now bear that Tom l&amp;an will not attend the Rank ft file Conference; he la at present at York,    This is due to the sobering influonoo of office; v/hile he pretends to he as revolutionary as over ho is in reality devoting all his time to routine Trail e Union work.
THIS RANK AND FILE COflVBUTlONThis Convention, whioh was postponed in order to synchronise with the Tra&amp;e Unions Congress% begins to-day at the Westminster Central Hall and will be continued at the International Socialist Club on Thursday and Friday evenings.   The postponement baa damped the enthusiasm and it will require all the fire of Tom Mann and other extremists to rekindle it.   The agenda, which were published in my report No. 39, were drawn by Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, but it is said that the delegates have already had time to forget most of their instructions.   I have been informed privately that Miss Pankhurst has&quot; been advised not to attend as very rowdy meetings are expected.The finances of the Central London Council of the Shop Stewards show a deficit of  23 for the three months ending December 31st, 1919.   The Police and Prison Officers1 Union is affiliated to this Committee.THE COST OF LIVINGIncreased wages in practically every industry to meet the high cost of living are oertain to be demanded.   Mjy correspondents continue to report that if the Government could take some drastic action to reduoe prices the influence of the extremists would be extinguished.   There is now an inclination to listen to any remedy such as the socialisation of industry as better than the present high prices.   At the I South Wales Miners&apos; Conference on March 8th a large section of the delegates advocated direct action for a reduction in the cost of living and there is no doubt that this is the one point on whioh direct action would be popular in every industry.
M       /l       MMTHIS HOUSING QUESTIONNext in importance to the cost of living ie the . scarcity of houses.   The Birmingham Trades and labour Council passed a resolution on March 6th, condemning the building of factories, public houses and kinema theatres.   The feeling that this should^ be suspended is ve general throughout the country.        (  .On Wednesday last the Trade Union leaders :of-the building trade decided to recommend their men to work overtime on housing schemes.   The proposal cannot be adopted without a ballot, which is to be taken as soon as possible.   In contrast to this sensible decision, a letter dated February 23rd. is.being circulated by the National Federation of Shop Stewards in the. Building and Aircraft Trades, which is endorsed by the London District Council, setting out immediate demands for a shorter working day, .. an increase of wages, workshop and Job control and . ,,?teventually the emancipation of our class.&quot; &apos;    -:THE LIQUOR TRAPS -    -It is reported that the attention of Trade Union . leaders is being called to the liquor and brewing ..: interests as the greatest profiteering concern in the country as well as being a dangerous influence at elections.   There is a talk of putting these industries -under public control in order to obtain a better quality of beer and to sweep away the many evils to be found in public houses under the present system.THE C0-OPSRATIVB MOVSMSNT AND TRADE UNIONSThe movement to induce the Trade Unions to investtheir/
their funds in Co-operative,Societies continues.   A few years ago some &quot;branches of the Engineers transferred, their banking accounts to the Co-operative Society in Sheffield, but after a short time they reverted to the London City and-Midland Bank.   The Co-operators.admit that they lack the necessary knowledge of banking to meet the immediate - requirements of the branches end they want more capital. At the last delegate meeting.of the Engineers, it was .: ,   made compulsory for all the Branch officials to bank their fluids with the Co-operative Society.SCHISM IN TEE LABOUR movement the divisions, in the ranks of Labour and even in the ranks of the extremists continue to grow.   In Glasgow,&apos; . where the majority of the extremists are illiterate youths, they have repudiated the Trade Union and Labour Party leaders and the same position will soon exist in other large industrial centres. ,It seems to be taking . the form of a campaign, against Messrs. Thomas and Clynes.PEELING AMONG EX-SERVICE MEN   &quot;The encounter between the Police and the Woolwich men on March 1st has caused a good deal of ill-feeling and a threat of another demonstration, when the men will oome armed with bombs and other weapons.   The dates for&quot;this demonstration have been variously given as March 13th, 14th or 17th.   Mr, Prank Gildon, Secretary of the,,,  Bx-Service Men&apos;s Committee, has sent to &quot;The Pioneer&quot; (Woolwich) a statement that the men would be justified in taking such means to protect themselves as they consider necessary when they go to London again.   On the other hand, the speeches of this gentleman and hiscolleagues/
colleagues, Howarth and Livingstone, wore moderate in toneThe National Union of Ex-Service Men has been exceptionally active during the week.   Meetings have been reported from various parts of the country and the resolutions passed demand &quot;back pay&quot; at Colonial rates.   Th prospect of receiving a considerable sum of money naturally appeals to the men, and the scheme is  nominally supported by the Labour Party.   It seems clear, however, that even th Labour Party realises the impossibility of the demand and i merely working for the Ex-Service Men&apos;s votes.   One meeting was spoiled by a man saying it was not the &quot;real&quot; soldiers who were grousing but the young ones,who only went when the; were forced and have been grousing ever since.The National Union of Ex-Service Men is taking an act part in the preparations for the May Day demonstrations. 55 rougher elements anticipate- that there will be some indulge in disorder and violence, which v/ill be principally directe against the Police. &quot;Leave it to the N.U.X.&quot; is the war cr; when &quot;May Lay&quot; is the subject of discussion.Ex-Lieutenant George Nicholson has been in South Wales recently; he was well received but appears to have been lesfl revolutionary than usual.The Annual Conference of the National Union of Ex-Serv Men will be held at Birmingham on Saturday, April 3rd.GLASGOW ANARCHISTvGROUPMy correspondent reports that in spite of the efforts of Guy Aldred the anarchist movement is making no headway in Glasgow and will probably be submerged by the other revolutionary groups.   The group is in debt with the Nations Labour Press and Aldred has lately been speaking from Briti Socialist Party platforms.Rudolf/
Rudolf Rocker, Aldred&apos;s brother-in-law, who prior to .   the war was editor of the Workers1 Friend&quot;, en an&amp;rohist communist journal printed in Yiddish and published in the East End, has been arrested in Berlin.    Rocker, before his internment and subsequent deportation from this country, we.s ; a well known agitator and the cause of many strikes and much I troublo amongst&apos; the Jews,:ENGINEERS FOR RUSSIASeveral unemployed engineers have expressed a desire to go to Russia, where they understand there is. great need for skilled men,     in Sheffield considerable&apos; interest is being taken in the matter, but the men think that passports will be refused,    They contend that such action on the part of the Government would prove that the truth about Russia is officially concealed,MR. .E. D, MOREL.Mr0 E. D. Morel1s book &quot;Truth and the War&quot; is being -i published in Germany by the German Press,    The book was not*-allowed to leave this country during the war, but some copies were smuggled abroad and a facsimile was printed in Germany for propaganda purposes.    It is einticipated that this work will make a sensation in Germany and fill every German with satisfaction.      &apos; &apos;Slim FEIN IN GREAT BRITAINThe&apos; Home Rule Bill was discussed in some detail at a Manchester 3inn Fein Meeting by Sean MacBntee and A. 0&apos;Connor members of the - iD&amp;il Sireahn,: on March 1st,   Both denounced theBill/
Bill in the most extreme way, end the latter rldiouled the report of the British Labour delegation.   Some 1500 people were present,;but although the cheap seats were crowded, many of.those reserved were empty.Some 700 people attended a meeting of the Irish Self Determination League at Birmingham on March 1st, but they were chiefly of the poorer class.   The chairman J considered the attendance a happy augury for the future 1 of the branch, but my correspondent says that much hard work will have to be clone as regards the organisation of I the Irish element which is at present indifferent. Mr. Sean mcgrath, the general secretary of the Irish Self Determination League, appealed for funds, but as the more prosperous Irish people in Birmingham care little for Sinn Fein, no general response is expected.Sean HoLough1in visited Edinburgh recently and it is reported that he had an excellent reception from the local extremists.   There is still much friction regarding his position in Glasgow.On 13 th I larch a conference will take ^laCe in Glasgow to elect permanent officials for the Irish., i tt..&apos;Volunteers in Scotland.   Delegates from: the1 Sinn Fein poards of Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Dumbartonshire and Honfrewehire will be in.attendance,  vRepresentatives of 32 Sinn Fein Clubs in the West of Scotland were present at a conference on 7th March at 171, Renfield Street, Glasgow.   Reports wore presented from the delegates showing the local status of each Club, and the question of general administration was dealt with.The general expectation among the Sinn FeinVolunteers/
Volunteers is that they will be -mobilized in Ireland about faster time, and the;; are eagerly anticipating the event.J. llcGrath, the London organizer of the Self Determination League, has openly stated the t the present Homo Rule Bill before Parliament, if passed, will only bring more and more trouble in Ireland.   One of the questions asked at Chtndos Hall was &quot;tfill Ulster accept?&quot; end the -  answer was &quot;She will damned well have to acoeot an all Ireland ruling.&quot;Luring the past week the Irish element in London has been rather quiet.; interest seems to be centred in the coming St. Patrick&apos;s Lay festivities, Socials and Lances organised by tho Self Determination League being the order of the day.   Subscriptions for the Irish Loon appear to be coming in, collections are made at all meetings and a large sum is reported to have been amassed.There ms no improvement in the condition of the Provinces during the week.   Tho number of outrages reported, so far, is smaller than for the two preceding weeks, but the general state of the Provinces, with the exception of the greater part of Ulster, remains lawless and unsatisfactory. Intimidation was rife and there were several murders, and a large number of private residences were raided for arms. This may be duo to the fact that the rebel leaders realise that the authorities are determined to guoll the present state of lawlessness and rebellion and in consequence are asking a supreme effort to hold their own and keep up the confidence of their adherents.-iVidenco is accumulating that the preventive measures now/
now being carried out are beginning to have some result. The &quot;Curfew Order&quot; in Dublin has had a most salutary effect and does not appear to be causing the loyal portion of the population much inconvenience,   numerous successful raids and arrests have been carried out by the police and troops throughout the country.   Arms, ammunition and explosives have been found on several occasions.   The success of these raids has undoubtedly created some alarm in the Sinn Fein ranks and the arrest of their leaders has caused in some cases a certain amount of confusion.Cases have occurred in which the civil population has at last plucked up courage to denounce outrages as, in several instances lately, information has been forthcoiaii from eye-witnesses of such outrages.   In the West the Sinn Feiners, especially the farmer class, are withholding their savings from the Irish Republican loan, as they see little chance of deriving any benefits from subscribing.On 4th Larch a well known G-alway gentleman - Mr, Frank Shaw-Taylor - was shot dead near Athenry while travelling to the fair in his motor car, his chauffeur being also injured.   The motive for this murder is partly agrarian and partly Sinn Fein.   To popularise the latter movement in Bast Galway it has now been given an agrarian complexion and a campaign is on foot to compel landowners not .so much to sell as to practically hand over their estates to the people and a number of leading local gentleman have received threatening notices.   Agrarian unrest is alwaysIprevalent in this Country, but this recent development is very serious.In County Cork a ITr. Oliver was severely wounded by a band of armed raiders who came to intimidate him.   in several/
several instances persons have been maltreated for venturing to speak to the police and attempts to boycott the police from obtaining the ordinary necessaries of life have also ocourred.&quot;Old Ireland&quot;, the principal organ of Sinn Fein, appeared as usual on Friday, and is again to be seized wherever found by order of the Irish 3xeoutive.   The current number is rather worse than usual.   The paper seems anxious lest people should imagine the Sinn Fein leaders would listen to any compromise.   Dealing with the Home Rule Bill it declares - &quot;The first thing to do is to get the rejection of this Bill registered by the people of this country in such a manner that there will be no case whateverto be made for it........ So long as we refuse to recognise herusurped authority England has only two alternatives, evacuation or militarisation, and she is forced to adopt militarisation. All we have to do is to set our teeth grimly and hold on.&apos; Sooner or later, in our own time, she must abandon militarisation.&quot;The &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; is again to be seized this week wherever found.   Speaking of the Home Bule Bill it declines to waste time and space discussing &quot;the abomination&quot;.   &quot;It partitions Ireland and perpetuates the Unionist-Capitalist ascendancy.   It is a sham and fraud from first to last.&quot;This paper is largely taken up with the results of the recent Municipal and Urban Council elections at which it claims that labour won 364 seats, Sinn Fein 520, and the Unionists 316. It has also a mischievous article entitled the &quot;Land Y/ar of 1920&quot; dealing with large farms, the grievances of labourers and the alleged reluctance of farmers to tillsThere is no change in the industrial situation whicli presents no special features to cause anxiety at the moment, though to the still increasing cost of living is due anxiety and grumbling in the small towns.The general tone of the Sinn Fein movement in seeking to show tfrat the people will get everything under an Irish Republic is., however, distinctly Bolshevist.
