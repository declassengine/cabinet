THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.URGENT2.Representation of the People Bill, &apos; IF- iffimfliffi L.G.23,Memorandum by the M blister of Health,In this note I have set forth an analysis of the objects of this Bill, indicating under separate headsthose I should wish to accept, those I should wish to oppose, and those which I have thought it necessary todiscuss with my colleagues before arriving at any conclusions.I propose to accept the following provisions:-. Parliament any Fr r.n shis o.pbe^cegted.iroposals      (a) Application of Residence Qualification to women of full age on same terms as men (Clause 1).(b) Age qualification for University Franchise in case of women to be 21 as in case of men (Clause 3).. The adoption of the principle of equalisation of . women with men implied in the 2 preceding provisions necessitates in addition(c) Application of Business Premises Qualification&apos; to(if its abolition is rejected as I propose in paragraph (d) below).to women of full age on same terms as men.posals   3.   The following provisions shoujd, in my opinion, be&apos; eosed. opposed : -Parliamentary Franchise,(d) Abolition of Business Premises Franchise (Clause l)(e) Conferment of franchise at age of 19 upon female naval or military voters serving in or in connection with the present war (Clause 4(1)).
(f) Preservation of franchise for naval or military voters who qualified at age of 19 notwithstanding demobilisation before attaining full age (Clause 4(5)).(This is already provided for by the Government Bill, Representation of the People Bm.Ho.2).(g) Abolition of registration fco of one pound chargeable in certain cases by Universities.Loo aJL Q o v eramen  Fr an ch iseu(h) Conferment of local government franchise upon naval or military voters for any area for which they would have qualified but for service.Finally, I desire to consult my colleagues as to the attitude which should be adopted towards the following important proposal viz:-Local Government Franchise. (i)   The substitution, for the present local governmentfranchise qualifications, of a residence qualification (as in the case of the Parliamentary Franchise) applicable to men and women of full age.iIn the Appendix are given the several kinds of existing qualifications for the local government franchise, showing the position as regards men and women in parallel columns.   It will be seen that so far from women being at a disadvantage as compared with men, the reverse   -is the case:   for women are entitled to be registered not only in all circumstances in which men are entitled to be registered, but in other circumstances besides.   There
is no case therefore for the alteration of the local government franchise solely from the point of view of raising the qualification of woman to an equality with those of men.6. In its effect upon the electorate the proposedalteration is very far-reaching.   The number of local government electors registered in the first registers for the United Kingdom was over seventeen million. With the residence qualification proposed by the Bill it is estimated that the number of local government electors would be increased by some 9,000,000, or over 50 per cent.   Of this increase; over five millions is estimated to.be the additional number of women who would be added to the register, while the remaining three to four millions would represent the number of -men who would be added.7. Notwithstanding this net increase in the electorate,the alteration will undoubtedly disfranchise certain persons at present entitled to be registered.   The number of such persons cannot be estimated, but must be substantial.   For example, persons at present entitled to be registered in respect of the occupation of lands or promis es (e u g. bus iness premis es) which are not residential in character would lose their franchise by the substitution of the residence qualification for the occupation qualification.   Again, occupiers of farms with lands in more than one parish would lose their votes in the several parishes and would qualify only in respect of the residence at the farm itself.   Whatever
the merits or demerits of the proposal, it would certainly deprive such persons of the whole or a part of their present rights.8- The present local government franchise isnot restricted to those who are direct ratepayers and the inclusion in that franchise of persons not themselves rated is not therefore an innovation.   But it may he noted that the class specially hit by the disfranchising consequences Indicated in the preceding paragraph would usually be those who are direct]-; ratod,0.
