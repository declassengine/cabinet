8011BBO1AL &quot;    &apos;   26ft?THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHIG MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT,Interval between the Poll and the Counting of Votes.   L.G.24.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.(1)   With reference to Home Affairs Committee Minute 50, para, 5, I have made further enquiries as to the number of absent i voters who polled either before polling day, or within 4 days there-after.     I attach a table, showing the information which Is available in regard to 6 recent bye-elections.     It will be observed that, of the absent voters who actually voted, the percentage who returned their papers more than 4 days after the poll was small, varying from 23$ down to 5$.(2)   With regard to the possibility of meeting the difficulty, by declaring all areas on.land abroad to be proxy areas, it appears clear, after consultation with Parliamentary Council, that this expedient would require legislation, and in these   $ circur:stances I have refrained, pending consideration of the figures and proposal now put forward, from referring the point to the Law Officers.(3)   It will be remembered that the General Post Office and other Departments concerned were of opinion that an interval of 12 days, excluding Sundays, between the day of nomination and theI day of the count would suffice to enable ballot papers to be receivedrand returned by the most distant military units concerned, viz; those serving on the Rhine.   Since that estimate allowed, as I understand,1 - *     ,HI certain small margins of time at various stages which would not be I required in most cases, and having regard to the. small number of jvotes involved, 1 suggest that an interval of 11 c .ear days, I excluding Sundays,, should be reasonably sufficient.    An interval cf ill clear weekdays must always allow. 2 Sundays, rendering the total 1 interval 13 days in all.     But if the period were further reduced by a
single day, one Sunday might be lost, and the period thus reduced to 11 days in all.I am advised that it would be possible to make an Order in Council providing that the count should take place in all cases after an interval of 11 clear days, excluding Sundays, from nomination day, irrespective of the date of the poll?   and I suggest that such an arrangement would, in the circumstances, afford reasonably adequate facilities for naval or military voters.In the oaso of general elections, and In the base of bye-elections where tho returning officer fixed the ninth day after nomination as the polling day, the result of the above arrangement would be that the Interval between polling day and the day of the count, would be 2 clear days only (excluding Sunday).   But the returning officer has the power to fix the poll In the case of,a bye-election not leas than 4, and not more than 8, clear days after the nomination day; - and in the infrequent cases in which he exercised his discre-tion, by fixing the polling day on the fifth day after nomination ,   day, the interval between the polling day and the day of the .- count would, be 6 clear days (excluding Sunday) *-   On this plan, therefore, the interval between the poll and the count would be not less than 2, and not more,than 6, clear days;: but usually, according to past-experience, the former; Sunday, in all cases, being excluded.C, ADDISON.Ministry of Health.16. 5. 1920.
