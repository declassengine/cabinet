JITHIS DOCUMENT   IB THE   PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S--O0mNl ENT)CABINET .1.844 . . &apos;.1NT0XIGATING LIQ,UOR REGULATION BILL. , (Memorandum by t\e Minister of Pensions).The Bill contains   many olauses which seem to me to provoke criticism whioh might be avoided by revision, and some-times by re-drafting, but I will deal only with the more important points upon whioh controversy is bound to arise.Pirst, t will summarise the Bill as I am not sure that the memo, circulated by the President of the Board of Education (&amp;.P.648) brings out quite completely the difficulties to be enoountered.Part X. sets up a Licensing Commission whioh is a central authority under the Seoretary of State with Advisory Counoils and Committees.Part II provides for looal option.   One tenth of the electors of various localities may cause a poll to be taken and if 55$ of those voting and 35$ of those entitled to vote carry the resolution, 25$ of the licenses In the locality shall be extinguished and there are neoessary provisions for restricting new licenses and new olubs in such localities.So far Part II follows the Scottish Act, but no power is given to the electors to vote for prohibition as oan be done)in Scotland.If a referendum is set up at all, why should the electors not be allowed to vote for prohibition.After three years a similar prooedure may be followed l)      to further reduce then existing lioenses by 25$ making   a total reduotion of 43$,Lioenses.K
Licenses reduced are&apos; to &quot;be paid for by annual instalments out cf the compensation levy which will require to be five times as  r-eat an the existing&apos;maximum levy if the payments are to be completed within ton years.Holders of the licenses reduced will not receive payment as at present   in exchange for the reduced license but by instalments with 6% interest spread over ten years.They may have mortgaged their licensed premises and the mortgagees may be   immediately payable, but their asset -s&amp;ll have been taken not for a cash payment but for a postponed annuity,The increased levy may have important effects en the receipts from exoise which should be examined, and it may produas great hardships in respect of some classes of houses -examples should be provided to show how so large a levy will w ork,Jart^IIi provides that the Commission under the Secretary of State may make regulations -(l) fixing the hours of sale, etc.(2)     ,,       ,, price(3)     j, gravity and strengthand may vary the hours, price and gravities in differentiflocalities and differentiate between-;v.?.e class of house and another.These powers are probably neaessary, though they will give rise to considerable controversy.Part III also  provides (01,9) as an additional power that the full levy shall always be made (unless the Commission say otherwise), and apparently additional licenses are to be declared redundant and extinguished over and above any reductions Under l(?oal option.Clauses 1G - 23, besideu providing for improvements in publio houses, contain further restrictions, same of whiah would no
i6dno doubt be aooepted without much opposition though they raise many minor debateable points.EartJ[V deals with Industrial Canteens and appears to allow the Commission (i.ec the Central Authority) to grant licenses for canteens in local factories, etc?i^JLV\   In Clause 2 3, the Commission is substituted for the Central Control Board as regards State management in Carlisle and Enfield Lock districts and continues in force the D.C.R.A, regulations for the purpose.Clause 26 relating to State purchase is very controversial.   The Commission on its own   initiative if satisfied, after jfcmoh local enquiry as it   may think fit., that it is expedient that any area should become a State management distriot, may make a provisional order.If representation is   made by a County Borough or Urban or District Council to that effect, the Commission shall, unless they think the area too small, hold a local enquiry with a viewIto making a provisional order,. It   is not very clear $hat the provisional order is to contain, but it is intended that the Commission shall have power to take possession of all licensed premises in the area so as to bring them under State management and probably under State ownership.The second schedule gives very wide powers- even to acquire other businesses and other premises besides licensed businesses and premises. (It also permits the Commission without any license (whether justices or excise) to oarry on in any premises rOjOoupied by them any business involving the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor refreshment or tobacco and for that purpose the commission shall
shall not &quot;be subject to any cf the, provisions of the lav/ relating to licensing cr to any restrictions   imposed by lav; on persons oarrying on such business.   Any person appointed by the Commission may have the same powers and immunities as the Commissien.There is no provision whatever for any compensation C? putoohase price being paid to the dispossessed owners of the prcperties included in the provisional order.It is true that the provisional order has nc effect unlesc and until confirmed by Parliament and apparently it is intended to fix the basis cf purchase and payment by the H^ot approving the provisional order.It seems necessary to decide now and to insert in the Bill the basis upon whioh properties taken jompulsorily will be paid for and whether they are to be paid for on completion of the purohabe or by ten year-annuities if grave uncertainty and perhaps even financial ruin in some oases is to be avoided..Part-VI of the Bill appears to raise drafting pointsonly.The main difficulties to whioh I desire to draw attention ar-3 (l) Clubs;  (2) local option;  (3) State Purchase and Management.(l) As regards Clubs, I agrse that there must bo equality of treatment between clubs and licensed houses.   Clubs and their members are not likoly to support the measure and they may raise a formidable opposition in Parliament and in the country,(2) As regards Local Option. If the object is reduotion of redundant licenses, the object can: I think; be attained without local option.   The Bill itself can provide for an absolutereduction
reduction of such percentage of existing lioenses as may &quot;be thought desirable.An alternative set of clauses has been prepared on my suggostion for tho purpose.I do not know the feeling of the &apos;Trade&apos; but I can well believe that they would prefer to know their fate rather than have set up a system of local option now illogioally limited to reduction, but whioh they may reasonably fear will soon be extended to prohibition as in the Gcottish Aot.Of course there will be opposition tea 25% reduction but at least it will be arrived at withrut long periods of uncertainty accompanied by local option elections; local optisn elections will lead to Brewers&apos; Organisations in evory area and suoh organisations once formed are not likely to^be idle during the attempted p^r-jsag^ of tho Bill and at Parliamentary elections. (3)   As regards State purchase and management^ the present1scheme seems to me half-baked.As X have pointed out, there is no mothod of purchase, provided and no basis stated upon which the price is to be fixed,The Commission may at any time start proceedings which may or may net lead finally to State purchaso of houses in any area - the uncertainty arising must militate against the trade being carried out with self-respect or feelings of responsibility and must prevent the   improvement of licensed houses and the provision of new.hotels,I feel sure that tho oppos:taon-whioh will be aroused by this Bill will be formidable. I d..doubt whether it could be carried within any reasonable time in its present form.I would suggest that the Bill should be limited to maintaining the present powers&apos;for say two years.   This.could bedone
dona by dropping Part II and State purchase and-modifying--other olauses; mcr* time could then be given to the serious questions raised by the present form of the Bill.If, however, it is not possible to so limit the Bill, then I suggest that the alternative Olauses should be adopted instead cf the local option olauses and that the State purchase olause should be completed by settling methods of arriving at the price and of payment, subject to a previous examination of the effect of increasing the maximum lsvy to five times its present amount upon the revonua from excise c,-nc as to its sufficiency or otherwise to form the ebmpeiisation fund to reduce the licenses to the extent decided,(ltd.)Ministry of Pensions,VCo
