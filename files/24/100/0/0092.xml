This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government. ^3 secret.0CP,   892THE CABINET.ILITARY COMMAND AT CONSTANTINOPLE.EMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the question of the Command in Constantinople. As urgent representations have been received from General Milne on the 16th instant I hope that the matter will receive the very early consideration of my colleagues.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,ISth March, 1920.0152 5451From the records of a conversation betv/een British and French delegates, held at   I.C.P. Downing Street on 10th March, 1920, at 1.30 p.m., on the subject of the Military    70 A. Command at Constantinople, it appears that a decision was arrived at that there should be complete equality between the French and English Generals in this area.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff notes this decision with the greatest concern and feels it his duty to point out to the Cabinet that it can but be productive of the unhappiest consequences. Far from providing the solution to the difficulties which have arisen owing to the unfortunate friction existing between the two Commanders in the past, it does but add fuel to the flame. For whereas the causes for this disagree-ment have hitherto been limited to cases where General Franchet d&apos;Esperey interfered unduly with General Milne&apos;s Command, it will, under the present proposal, be possible for the two Commanders to disagree on every occasion in which concerted action is required, and in view of the strained relations which have hitherto existed between them, it would be unduly sanguine to suppose that they will be able to work together with any cordiality when they both are on an equal footing.Apart from the personal aspects of the case, there are also the much more serious consequences which will occur owing to the delay in taking the necessary military measures for the control of affairs in Constantinople. At any moment it may be necessary to take prom pt and decisive steps to prevent outbreaks of a serious nature in the city. How is it possible to ensure that promptitude or decision characterizes any of these measures when there are two or more independent and unsympathetic Commanders whose mutual consent is a necessary preliminary to their execution ?It is to be feared that the friction existing between the Commanders is likely to extend under such circumstances to the subordinate ranks, and the presence of Allied troops in Constantinople under such conditions will not have a very salutary effect in preserving peace and order in the city.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff ventures to hope that it may be found possible to modify this decision by keeping the French and British Commands entirely separate. It is considered that the British should be solely responsible for the Command in Constantinople and the area up to and including the Chatalja Lines. The Erench Commander could then have undisputed control &quot;over the remainder of Turkey in Europe.A strong argument in favour of such an arrangement, the force of which even the French must admit, is that the Turkey of the immediate future lies entirely in Asia Minor with the exception of the above small enclave in which Constantinople, still the seat of the Turkish Government, lies. It must be obvious that the Commander responsible for the military control of Asia Minor must also be responsible for the military control of the Turkish capital.If, however, the present decision has to stand, it would appear that the only feasible method of working is for the Allied High Commissioners, acting in concert, to allot definite zones and tasks to the respective Commanders for the execution of such measures as the situation may demand.(B20/140)  100  3/20  H&amp;S   8047wo
