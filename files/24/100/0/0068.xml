SB C li   T. Copy No.      -,   &quot;&quot;J CJ. BINE T.ftp.-868.IOi,CIdJIT;,lMT AND DIoTKIBUTICN OJ VOLUNTLdR LABOUR.(Memorandum by the Minister of Labour;). TPrevTous&apos;&quot;&quot;papers&quot;&quot;C.PT596&quot;an l %1417&quot;(1) At a meeting&quot; of the Cabinet on the 18th February they approved the proposals which I made in CP.593 as to the recruitment of Volvnteer Labour during an emergency^One of the proposals thus approved is the appointment of aController to act during an emergency as Chairman of a Central Co--ordinating&apos;Committee and to supervise the recruitment and distributionof volunteer labour throughout G-reat Britain.(2) The. Sujply and Transport Committee took the view that theController should be responsible to met and I assented to such anarrangement.(3) In order to be ready for the emergency certain preliminary    $ action has to be taken, in particular the task of seeing that the Chairman of Local Volunteer service Committees are equipped with instructions and assisted in making provisional&quot; (confidential) .&apos;Varrangements for any emergency,  in consultation with the representa-tives of the National oervices interested.(4) In the selection of Chairman the Home Office have assisted me by enlisting the services of Chief Constables: but the Chief Constables cannot deal with the questions or&apos; detail which are already arising as to the functions of the Chairman.,   So long as the position at (2) above holds good it would naturally follow that the Minister of Labour would be responsible for any necessary correspon-dence with the prospective Chairmen: but this is not an arrangement which I could regard as satisfactory.(5) The Minister of Labour is responsible to the Government for avoiding industrial disputes and for conciliating the parties v;hen a dispute has arisen.   This function is perhaps the most important of the functions of the Ministry of Labour, and it may well prove to be of crucial importance in avoiding industrial crisis that the Minister
20th March, 1920.of Labour should not be hampered by any suspicion of secret preparations on his part.(6) I feel that responsibility for the control of the volunteer service arrangements is inconsistent with the Minister of Labour&apos;s position as conciliator in industrial disputes,: and that this inconsistency is almost as dangerous during a period of relative industrial peace as during an actual emergency.    It is impossible to be certain that details as to the arrangements which are being made will not leak out.    I can conceive nothing which would so quickly or so permanently destroy the satisfactory position which the Minister of Labour now enjoys in relation to industrial disputes as the public knowledge that he is chiefly responsible in the preparation of arrangements which would certainly be regarded as strike breaking arrangements, and that he would be responsible for the execution of those arrangements when the time came,,(7)   I feel, therefore, that the responsibility for the Wlunteer Service arrangements ought forthwith to be placed upon other shoulders than those of the Minister of Labour.,    I am inclined to suggest that the Hooie secretary should be responsible. I venture to ask for a very early decision,  .(Signed)   L.S. HOME.
