This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.SECRET.3THE CABINET.BILL OP INDEMNITY AND STATUTE OP LIMITATIONS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. The Interdepartmental Committee on the Indemnity Bill and Statute of     121 Limitations, set up by the Home Affairs Committee of the War Cabinet at their    &apos;j042 29 th Meeting on 23rd May last, have now submitted their Final Report with a Draft of the Bill which they recommend should be introduced early in the present Session. Copies of this Report and of the Draft Bill are attached.2. The Committee had already submitted an Interim Report (asking for guidance as to the basis on which compensation should be assessed) to the Cabinet, who decided that chums for indirect and consequential loss should be barred, and that the principles on which payment for direct and substantial loss had been assessed hitherto, e.g., by the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission and the Board of Arbitration, should be validated, and that these tribunals should be given statutory recognition (G.T. 8203).Effect has been given to this decision in the Bill as drafted.3. The Bill, which is explained in detail in the Committee&apos;s Report, deals with two distinct questions, viz. :-(i.) Indemnification against the consequences of acts done in good faith, but in excess of authority or without jurisdiction, in carrying out duties in connection with the prosecution of the war.(ii.) The validation of certain laws, ordinances and proclamations, and of sentences of military and other courts.4. Of these, the first is the more contentious. Clause 1 of the Bill lays down the general principles that, subject to specified exceptions, proceedings shall not lie against any person holding office under, or employed by the Crown, or against anyone acting under the authority of such a person in respect of any act done in good faith in the execution of his duty.By way of exception it is proposed to allow proceedings to be taken (a) on behalf of His Majesty or Government Departments ; or in respect of (6) breaches of contract (subject to a limitation of 12 months); (c) negligence ; \d) damage to person or property in a foreign country (subject to the fiat of the Attorney-General) or (e) the validity or infringement of a patent.The reasons for these exceptions are set out in paragraph 4 of the Report. The admission of claims founded on negligence may have the effect of exposing officers and others in certain cases to vexatious actions, but their liability is limited by the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, which provides that action must be taken within 6 months from the date of the alleged injury or damage.5. It is to Clause 2 of the Bill, which gives effect to the Cabinet decision referred to in paragraph 2, that the strongest opposition may be expected. This Clause overrules decisions of the CourtsVdeclaring invalid the principles, laid down in certain of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, that compensation should be assessed on the basis of cost price, plus a reasonable pre-war rate of profit, and should only be paid in respect of direct and substantial loss.But I desire to point out that&apos; the principle of payment on the basis of actual cost plus a normal rate of profit having been introduced into contracts, it was necessary to import it into requisitions if the unwilling seller to whom compulsion had to be applied was not to be entitled to the benefit of full market prices, whilst the willing seller who entered into contracts received only a price based on his actual cost with a fair profit thereon.Power to requisition, if not reinforced in this manner, would have been an extravagance rather than an economy, since requisitioning was only applied when the military demand was known to be in excess of the supply of an article the market price of which consequently advanced as increasing military demands pressed values up.(B20/125)   150  3/20  H&amp;S   8010wo
1 Requisition on the basis of cost (i.e., of real as opposed to market value) merely-operated to deprive property owners of their unearned war increment, and any Parliamentary opposition to legislation in this matter must urge in effect the naked plea that those who have already received the cost of their goods plus a reasonable profit thereon are to receive in addition the profiteers margin of gain.The Executive^ interference with the rights of property would appear to have scandalised the Courts, but I am of opinion that any concession to the ex post-facto demands of war profiteers would far more deeply scandalise public opinion.If the Government is called upon to pay market prices, the additional cost to the Exchequer in respect of the requisition of rum alone would be about 750,000/., and while it is impossible to give an accurate statement of the sum which will be involved in respect of all classes of goods, it has been estimated by representatives of the departments concerned that it will run to hundreds of millions of pounds.It would be unfair to the very large number of traders who have loyally accepted payment for their goods on the basis of cost, plus a reasonable pre-war profit, if those who have stood out are to receive compensation on a much more generous basis.Moreover, the second portion of the clause giving a statutory right of access to the Tribunals set up to deal with claims in respect of requisitions should tend to soften the opposition to the clause.6. Proceedings in Prize Courts are exempted from the operations of the Bill by Clause 3 ; Clause 4 validates Proclamations and Orders in Council, issued during the period of the present war under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, prohibiting or restricting the importation of goods into the United Kingdom, and licenses granted in pursuance of any such Proclamations or Orders.7. Clause 5 validating sentences by Military and Special Courts set up in occupied territories and Clause 6 validating laws, ordinances and proclamations in such territories are clearly reasonable and should meet with general acceptance.8. Clause 7 extends the provision of the Bill (with specified exceptions) to the whole of his Majesty&apos;s Dominions, subject to such modifications by Order in Council as may be necessary to adapt it to the special circumstances of the Dominions, Colonies and India.9. In its later discussions the Committee has had the assistance of the Solicitor-General, who concurs in the Bill, which has also been accepted by the representatives of all the Departments concerned, and in its present form seems to meet the require-ments of the case.I therefore submit the Bill, which, it is assumed, will be placed in the charge of a Law officer, for the approval of my colleagues with a view to its early introduction in Parliament.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The Wae Office,12th March, 1920.
SECOND AND FINAL REPORT OF THE INTERDEPART-MENTAL COMMITTEE ON THE INDEMNITY BILL AND STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.To the Cabinet.Members of the Committee.The Right Hon.

Drury, O.B.E., War Office,Secretary.Terms or Reference.&quot;To draft a general Bill of Indemnity (1) to cover acts purporting to be done under the authority of the Emergency Acts, Regulations and Orders, and (2) to bar all claims against the Crown arising out of, or in connection with, the war, unless presented within 12 months after the termination of the war, or within 12 months after the date at which such claims arose, whichever is the longer period.&quot;1. The first Report of the Committee submitted to the War Cabinet on the 1st July, 1919, dealt with the question of the Statutory recognition of the Tribunals which had been set up during the war for the purpose of assessing compensation in respect of the requisitioning of ships or goods, and damage to property or business consequent upon the exercise of the Crown&apos;s Prerogative and the powers conferred by the Acts relating to the Defence of the Realm. It also dealt. with the proposal to confirm the refusal of these Tribunals to grant compensation for indirect and con-sequential loss arising out of such requisitioning or damage. The present report deals generally with the form- of the Bill and the considerations which have guided the Committee in its drafting.2. A Bill of Indemnity has to provide for two distinct classes of cases, viz.: (i.) Indemnification against the consequences of acts done in good faith but in excess of authority or without. jurisdiction, in carrying out duties in connection with the prosecution of the war.(ii) The validation of certain laws, ordinances and proclamations.3. The exigencies of the war frequently necessitated immediate action on the part of persons who had^ little experience to guide them, and who were not in a position to. ascertain the legality of their actions, and it was inevitable, therefore, that[A 2295](B20/79)   125 &apos;3/20  HAS  7903wo
irregularities should occur. Courts-martial have passed sentences which, owing to some defect in the constitution of the court, or other legal defects, they had no jurisdiction to award. The Committee are unanimous that protection should be given to all persons employed in the service of the Crown or acting under the authority of a person so employed, for any acts they may have done in connection with the present war, provided such acts were done in good faith and in the execution of their duty; for the defence of the realm; the enforcement of discipline; or otherwise in the public interest, -This protection would not have the effect of Validating an irregular sentence by a court martial, which could be quashed as heretofore. The Committee are also of the opinion that the principle of indemnification should be extended to persons serving under the Eed Cross and other similar Societies, who, in effect, were acting under the authority of, or in conjunction with, the military authorities.Clause 1.(1) of the Bill lays down this general principle.4. The Committee recognize that there must be certain exceptions to the general principle. Cases arise in which it would be inadvisable to bar proceedings, and after giving careful consideration to the matter, the Committee have come to the conclusion that the following classes of cases should be excepted : (a.) Clause 1 (l) (a). Proceedings by or on behalf of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government.  It may be desirable for the Government to prosecute a person who has com-mittecl some act which has had consequences prejudicial to the public interest, although it might not he advisable to allow a prosecution by an individual, if the consequences had been prejudicial to him only.This exception will enable the Government to take proceedings regardless of the time which may have elapsed since the cause of action arose. The position of the Government in this respect is essentially different from that of an individual. The former may be seriously prejudiced in its efforts to rebut belated claims by the shutting down of war organizations and the dispersal of the staff which dealt with the matter in dispute; this disadvantage does not arise to the same extent in the case of claims by individuals.(b.) Clause 1 (1) (b). Proceedings in respect of breaches of contract. The Committee do not consider that actions for alleged breaches of contract or of rights thereunder should be barred. At the same time, they have limited the period within which such actions can be brought to one year from the termination of the war, or from the date when  the cause of action arose, whichever may be the later. This limitation is in accord with the terms of reference.(c.) Clause 1 (1) (c). Proceedings for injury to person or property on account, of negligence. Cases have been brought to the notice of the Committee where damage has been caused by officers who have&quot; attached more importance to the speed)/- execution of their duty than to the public safety, e.g., the driving of cars at an excessive rate of speed regardless of the ensuing danger. There have been cases of collisions which have been freely dealt with on the footing that there is legal liability in the officer or driver concerned. Some of these cases have been brought before the courts, while others have been settled.Although the Committee consider that an exception of this nature will not tend to decrease litigation, which is one of the main objects of the Bill, they recognize that there would be strong opposition, and rightly so, to any provision which interfered with the liberty of the private citizen, and deprived him of his usual remedy in this class of case. The main protection against an abuse of this exception will be the provisions of the Public Authorities Protection Act, which limits the time within which actions may be brought against a person for any act done in pursuance of, or execution, or intended execution of a public duty, or in respect of an alleged neglect or default in the execution of such duty to six months from the date when the cause of the action arose, or in the case of continuing injury or damage from the cessation thereof. The right to bring an action in most cases will therefore have already expired, since, in view of the ^cessation of hostilities, the majority of the alleged negligent acts must have been committed more than six months prior to the present date.   The Committee consider that
it will be a difficult matter to prove negligence, but if it can be proved, damages should be allowed.Neither of the Tribunals mentioned in Clause 2 of the Bill possess jurisdiction to consider claims for personal injury, which will probably form the bulk of the claims arising out of negligence, and the Committee consider that on the whole these cases should be brought before the Courts. They are of the opinion, therefore, that this exception should be included in the Bill.(d.) Clause 1 (1) (d). Proceedings for injury to persons or property in a foreign country. The Committee do not. feel that it is within the scope of a Bill of this nature to bar proceedings in respect of injury to persons or property in a foreign country. They are more disposed to except this class of case from the general operation of the section, since the number of cases likely to arise should be very small. With regard to France, Belgium and Italy, Conventions have been concluded which provide a special machinery for the settlement of claims arising out of injury or damage caused by British troops in these countries, and similar machinery has been set up to deal with claims by foreign citizens against British subjects in the occupied territories, e.g., Salonica, Constantinople, Palestine, Mesopotamia, German East Africa and North &apos; Russia, The Committee therefore recommend that before any such claims can be brought under the provisions of this Section, the consent of the Attorney-General should be obtained. The Committee consider that if this were left totally to the discretion of the Attorney-General, he might be placed in a somewhat difficult position, and they therefore provide that the flat is not to be given in cases where, if the act had been committed in the United Kingdom, no remedy would lie, or if other adequate remedies are provided.(e.) Clause 1(1) (e). Proceedings in respect of the validity or infringement of patents. Under the Patents and Designs Acts, 1907 and 1919, the Crown has the right to use patents subject to the payment of Royalties, the amount of which is settled as provided by the Acts. This right has been freely exercised during the war and the assessment of compensation has been dealt with by a Commission under Mr. Justice Sargant, set up by the Treasury, and the Committee are of the opinion that this procedure should be continued. It is possible that the patentee will have the alternative right of applying to the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission, but as that Commission deals only with direct loss, it is anticipated that this alternative remedy will be seldom available. Cases arise from time to time where there is a dispute as to the validity or infringement of a patent, and the Committee feel that the parties concerned &apos;should not be deprived of their right to establish the validity of the patent or the fact of its infringement in the courts of the realm. The Committee recommend, therefore, that exception should be made in cases arising out of patents.5. Clause 1 (2).&apos; Sub-section (1) bars legal proceedings, but doubts may arise as to whether a Petition of Right is a legal proceeding. In order to remove any doubt,, this sub-section provides that, for the purposes of the Clause, a Petition of Right shall be deemed to be a legal proceeding.6. Clause 1 (3). The protection granted under this Clause will only be effective if the accused can prove that the act was done in good faith, and in the execution of his duty. The Committee consider that a certificate of a Government department that an act was done under the authority of a person employed by that department, should be sufficient evidence of the authority for the action and they are of opinion that any such act should be deemed to have been done in good faith unless the contrary is proved.7. In their first Report, a copy of which is set out in Appendix II. hereto, the Committee pointed out the difficulties which had arisen during the war by reason of the reluctance, and in some cases the refusal, of claimants to submit their, claims in respect of damage or loss of property and goods, to the Tribunals set up to deal with them. Whilst in the majority of cases claimants have either settled their claims on the basis of the principles applied by the Tribunals, or have accepted the award of the latter, in others they have either refused to submit their claims to the Tribunals, or, submit-ting them, have expressly reserved their legal remedies.(7903) A i
The Tribunals have consistently refused to grant compensation for indirect and consequential loss or damage, and as pointed out in the Committees first Report, if claims of this nature were admitted, and the assessment of compensation generally governed by the rules of ordinary application, the Government would be liable to claims which, although no accurate estimate is possible, may amount to as much as 700,000,000/. In the majority of cases, the rulings of the Tribunals, and the compensation awarded by them, have been loyally accepted, and the Committee do not consider it just that those who have declined to accept the Tribunals&apos; decisions should receive more advantageous treatment, especially as in that case it would be scarcely possible to maintain a refusal to re-open the cases already decided.8. Clause 2(1). The Committee submitted to the Cabinet with their first Report alternative clauses. The Cabinet decided that the second alternative form was preferable. This clause reproduces with certain amendments of a drafting nature the clause approved by the Cabinet, which gives a right to compensation (except to subjects of a State which has been at war with his Majesty during the present war) in the following cases: (a.) To owners of ships or vessels, or any cargo space or passenger accommodation therein, requisitioned for the purposes of the war ; the compensation to be based on the principles hitherto applied by the Admiralty Arbitration Transport Board.(b.) To anyone who has suffered direct or substantial loss or damage by reason of interference with his property or business through the exercise of any prerogative right of the Crown or any power under the Defence of the Realm Acts; compensation to be based on the principles hitherto applied by the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission.The language of paragraphs (a) and (6) of sub-section (l) of the clause follows closely the language of the proclamation setting up the Arbitration Board, and the terms of reference to the Losses Commission respectively.The exclusion of subjects of States which have been at war with His Majesty during the present war-, follows the principle adopted by the Royal Commission setting up the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission, which expressly excluded the granting of. compensation to subjects of enemy States, and this principle has been confirmed by the Treaty of Peace with Germany.9. Clause 2 (l) Proviso (i.) Sir William Walton, Yice-Chairman of the Admiralty Arbitration Transport Board, informed the Committee that confusion had arisen, and litigation had been needlessly prolonged by applicants obtaining an order from the Courts under the Arbitration Act, 1889, directing the Tribunal to state a case. The Committee consider that the statement of cases should be in the sole discretion of the Tribunals, and that the Courts should have no jurisdiction to direct them to state cases under the Arbitration Act.] 0. Clause 2(1), Proviso (ii.) limits the right to bring a claim to a period of 1 year from the termination of the present war, or the date when the transaction giving rise to the claim took place, whichever may be the later. This is in accordance with the terms of reference.11. Clause 2 (1), Proviso (iii.) excludes the right to compensation in any case where, in accordance with the principles upon which the Tribunals have hitherto acted, no compensation would have been awarded. This excludes the possibility of the bringing of claims of the class which have hitherto been refused.12. Clause 2 (l), Proviso (iv.) The chief power to acquire land compulsorily (apart from that under the Defence Act, 1842, and the Military Lands Acts) is in ordinary cases derived from the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, and in the case of the Liquor Control Board from the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1915. The former Act expressly defines the principles of upon which compensation is to be assessed for land taken thereunder. With regard to the latter Act, the Law Officers have expressed the opinion that compensation for land taken thereunder must be assessed in accordance with the principles laid down in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919. The Committee consider it would be unwise to interfere with the assessment of compensation in these cases. They have excepted, therefore, the assessment of compensation for property taken under these Acts from the operation of the Bill.13. Clauses 2 (2) ancj (3) lay down the principles upon which the compensation is  to be assessed and  provide that the certificate of the Tribunal as to the
principles upon which they have hitherto acted shall be conclusive. The Losses &quot;Commission have issued full reports from time to time of the cases submitted to them, from which the principles which they have applied could no doubt be deduced. The Admiralty Board, however, have not issued any such reports. In order to remove any doubt the Committee consider that the certificates of the Tribunals should be conclusive in both cases.14. Clause 2 (4), defines the Tribunals before which,claims are to be brought.Clmse 2 (5) gives the Tribunals power, to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, and to take evidence on oath. The Committee consider this power necessary to enable the Tribunals to deal effectively with cases.16. The Committee are not unmindful that the general effect of Clause 2 will be to override the decision of the Court of Appeal in the De Keysers Hotel case and that of Mr. Justice Salter in the Newcastle Breweries case. In the latter case a claim of 28,374/. was made in respect of 239 puncheons of rum requisitioned by the Admiralty. The Admiralty, acting upon the principles of assessment of compensation laid down in the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2b offered, and paid without prejudice, the sum of 10,774/., that is to say, at a rate of about 12,9. Gd. per gallon. The Army (Supply of Food, Forage and Stores) Act, 1914, provided that the power of requisitioning given by Section 115 of the Army Act, 1881, in respect of horses, carriages, &amp;c, should extend to &quot;food, forage and stores of every description.&quot; That Section prescribed that due payment shall be made for articles so requisitioned, and Mr. Justice Salter&apos;s judgment appears to imply that due payment means payment at market value. As the war progressed, it was found almost impossible to ascertain fair market value, since the requisition of-articles in large quantities by the Government for the troops automatically forced up the price out of all proportion to the cost thereof to the sellers. For this reason the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2b was passed, providing that the price to be paid should not be the so-called market price, but the cost price to the sellers plus a reasonable rate of profit. The effect of Mr. Justice Salter&apos;s decision, if maintained on Appeal, will be to invalidate this provision, in which case the claimants will probably receive nearly 18,000/. over and above the sum which would otherwise be payable. The difference between the price of the rum assessed on the basis laid down in Regulation 2b and the so-called market value on the date of requisition is 10s. per gallon, and as over one and a-half million gallons of rum were requisitioned, the additional cost to the Exchequer in respect of rum alone will be about 750,000/. which represents excess profit pure and simple. The extra charge to the Exchequer in respect of all classes of goods would possibly run. into several hundred millions of pounds or almost as much as the total national debt prior to the war. The Committee recognize that legislation which may affect pending disputes can only be justified in exceptional cases, but they consider that present circumstances call for such legislation, in that if pending disputes are excepted from the operation of the Bill, the evil to which the clause is directed will not be averted, as the claims which it is desired to confine within a reasonable limit have already arisen. Notwithstanding that the clause may possibly meet with strong opposition from vested interests, the Committee feel that when the matter is fully explained, there should be no difficulty in securing its acceptance by Parliament, especially as the desired object of the opposition is to secure to the owners of stocks requisitioned for the purposes of the war, not only the actual cost plus a reasonable rate of profit, but also the abnormal increases of price due to the requisitioning and to other circumstances of the war; The Committee are supported in their views as to the necessity for this clause by Lord Mersey, the Chairman of the Admiralty Arbitration Transport Board, Sir William Walton and Lord Terrington, the Chairman of the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission. Copies of opinions expressed by Lord Mersey and Lord Terrington are set out in Appendix I.17. Clause 3. Claims have been brought both by neutrals and British subjects in the Prize Court in respect of loss or damage arising out of the seizure of ships as prizes of war. The only alternative to dealing with these claims in the Prize Court would be to settle them by diplomatic action, but in view of the inconvenience of this procedure, the Government have enoouraged the bringing of such actions in the Prize Court. The law of prize is one of International not of Municipal Law, and it would be contrary to policy to attempt to interfere with the principles of International Law in a Bill dealing with Municipal Law only. The &quot;Committee consider, therefore, that all -claims which can legitimately be dealt with by a Prize Court should be excluded from the operation of the Bill, whether such claims are brought by subjects of neutral states or by British subjects.
18. The clauses of the Bill referred to in the preceding paragraphs deal with the question of indemnification ; Clauses 4, 5 and 6 are concerned with the validation of certain proclamations, orders, sentences and laws.19. Clause 4. By virtue of the provisions of Section 43 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, the Government have from time to time during the war issued Proclamations and Orders in Council, prohibiting, except under licence, the importation of certain articles, in some cases generally, and in other cases from specified countries. Doubts have been expressed as to the legality of this procedure, since the Customs Consolidation Act refers to the importation of &quot; arms, ammunition, gunpowder and any other goods,&quot; and although the Law officers have expressed the opinion that the words &quot; any other goods&quot; can be construed to cover any goods whatsoever, Mr. Justice Sankoy has held in the recent case of Attorney-General v. Brown that the words &quot; any other goods&quot; must be construed ejusdem generis with the preceding words, and that any Proclamation or Order in Council purporting to prohibit the importation of goods outside the class generally known as &quot; arms, ammuni-tion and gunpowder &quot; are invalid and illegal, but his judgment may be reversed on Appeal. The officers who have seized goods under any such Proclamation or Orders are protected by Clause 1, but the seizure of the goods may give rise to very large claims for compensation against the Government. The Committee are strongly of opinion that, in order to set the matter at rest, all Proclamations and Orders in Council which have been issued in pursuance of the Customs Consolidation Act should be expressly validated.20. Clause 5 deals with the of sentences of military courts, which the Committee consider should be validated with the exception of those of courts martial, constituted in pursuance of any Statute. The latter differ from the former in that they are statutory courts, and their procedure is more generally defined. Any officers who may have been guilty of any irregularity or illegality in connection with the convening or confirming of courts martial or their findings or sentences are protected by Clause 1, but the Committee do not feel that persons who have been convicted by such courts should he deprived of the right to have the conviction, if illegal, quashed. It will be necessary to continue the validity oi sentences passed by military Courts (other than Courts martial) until the courts so established are abolished or superseded by other lawfully constituted authority.   121. Clause 6 deals with the validation of laws made in occupied territories. The right of provisional administrations to pass legislation demanded by the exigencies of war is recognized by International Law, but it may be that, in some cases the limits imposed by International Law on the exercise of the power so recognized have been exceeded. The Committee consider that any doubt as to the validity of such laws and ordinances should be set at rest and Clause 6 has been inserted to carry this into effect.22. The provisions as to the validation of sentences passed and laws made in occupied territories are provisionally made to have effect in the self-governing Dominions. The views of this matter of the three especially concerned with regard to mandated territories, namely, Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, have been requested by telegraph, and whilst the reply of the Union of South Africa has not yet been received, Australia and New Zealand both claim that their Parliaments have power to validate past action in the territories mandated to them. If this claim is admitted it may be necessary to limit the application of Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill to certain overseas territories only. With the exception of these clauses the Bill leaves the self-governing Dominions to pass their own legislation with regard to&apos; indemnification, but all the provisions will extend to the rest of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, and in order to make.the Bill applicable to India and the Colonies, where adaptations and modifications may be necessary, provision has been made to effect this by Orders in Council. The last lines of the section were inserted at the instance of the Government of India to meet a doubt that has arisen as to the power of the legislature to pass certain war measures, which follow the lines of emergency legislation in the United Kingdom. The Bill does not extend to Protectorates, as the.necessary provision for these can be made by the local legislatures, or by Orders in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act.23. The draft Bill is attached hereto, and in view of the necessity for passing the Bill before the date of the termination of the war, the Committee ask for the approval of the Cabinet, so that it may be introduced early in the present session. As there are pending cases which will be affected by the Bill, any delay in passing it into law would be fraught not only with serious inconvenience, but substantial damage and loss to litigants.
24. The Committee have received most valuable assistance from the Solicitor-general. They have also had the advantage of the advice of the Procurator-General, the Judge-Advocate of the Fleet, the Judge-Advocate-General, and the Tr easury Solicitor, who have attended their meetings from time to time. They also desire to acknowledge the help rendered by Lord Mersey and Sir William Walton, who have considered the recent drafts of the Bill, and have made suggestions, which have been gladly accepted by the Committee. The draft Bill has also been considered by Lord Terrington, the&apos; Treasury, the Ministry of Shipping, the Ministry of Food, and the Postmaster-General, all of whom are satisfied that the Bill is necessary, and that in its present form it will meet their requirements. In conclusion the Committee wish to record their sense of the great value of the assistance which they have received from Mr. G. H. Drury, O.B.E., their Secretary. It has fallen to him to prepare numerous memoranda on special points which have arisen in the course of their deliberations, and to carry on important discussions on legal and other questions with the officials responsible for the services affected by the Committee&apos;s recommendations. In these and other ways, as well as in the preparation of their reports, Mr. Drury&apos;s legal experience and practical ability have been of great benefit to the Committee.PEEL, Chairman. fEDWARD TROUP.

APPENDIX I.Defence of the Realm Losses Commission, Crewe House,15, Curzon Street, Mayfair, London, W. 1,Sir, 22nd September, 1919.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo-inviting my views, as Chairman of the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission, on the accompanying report of the Interdepartmental Committee submitted to the War cabinet and the memorandum of the Secretary of State thereon.   I have carefully considered these documents.I think the report states most ably and accurately the present and prospective-position as regards claims and compensation and the problem which has to be solved, and it becomes unnecessary for me to enlarge further upon it.I agree entirely with the opinion expressed by the Secretary of State in his memorandum, and 1 concur in his recommendation that the second alternative proposed by the Committee is the preferable one to adopt. I think the proposed Bill giving claimants statutory rights to prefer claims should make the tribunals statutory tribunals, with power to administer oaths,, to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the production and discovery of documents. I may add th t the present uncertainty owing to the De Keyser judgment is proving very embarrassing to the Royal Commission, and it is urgently necessary that the proposed Bill of Indemnity on the^ lines recommended should be passed into law with all possible despatch.T am, &amp;c,TerringtonAdmiralty Transport Arbitration Board,Dear Sir, 10th September, 1919.In answer to your letter of the 21st August, I think that the principles on which: this Board has acted should be declared valid and that all claims inconsistent with them should be barred. As those principles have not been officially declared in any way it is desirable for me to state them shortly.The construction which the Board under my direction, or with my approval, has placed on the Proclamation of the 3rd August, 1914, is that it authorizes payments for the use of vessels requisitioned, and compensation for damage to or loss of such vessels due to such use, but does not authorize compensation for any other damage or loss which the requisition may have caused incidentally to the owners or third persons who may happen to have had contractual relations with them.As regards payments for the use of vessels, the Board has held that increase of market values or rates due to the war should not be taken into account, and that payments should be based on a liberal estimate of the profits that an owner could have made if there had been no war.As regards claims for loss or damage the Beard has refused to entertain them unless they could be brought within the terms of the Proclamation construed as above. The claims consequently rejected were claims for indirect damage suffered by owners or third parties. In my opinion claims of that character are or should be inadmissible even apart from the Proclamation: they are of the nature of losses to which all members of the community were exposed more or less during the war. The interference with trade and business caused by the requisition of vessels is an ordinary and
(7903)necessary result of war. The. consequences to individuals must vary according to the nature of their business and affairs, and it appears to me that the only proper course is to leave each individual to bear the loss which happens to fall on him.I further think that it would be impossible to deal effectively with the innumerable claims which might be put forward if the principle of indemnity for indirect losses were allowed.I am, &amp;c.,Mersey(President),

The Committee on Home Affairs at their 29th Meeting, on the 23rd May, 1919, approved the War Office proposal for the appointment of an Interdepartmental Committee to draft a General Bill of Indemnity and Statute of&apos; Limitations, as recommended by Lord Cave&apos;s Committee. The Committee was accordingly constituted as set out above, and three meetings have been held.2. In the course of their investigation the Committee were faced with the difficult position that had arisen with regard to claims for compensation in respect of loss or damage to property or business in the United Kingdom occasioned by the exercise or purported exercise of rights or duties under the Prerogative of the Crown and the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations.3. Acting on the assumption that the owner had no legal right to compensation, the Government, with the approval of the House of Commons on the 31st March, 1915, set up a, Royal Commission of Inquiry (at first known as the Duke Commission and subsequently as the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission) to deal with the question of compensation to be paid (in cases not otherwise provided for) in respect of direct and
substantial loss incurred or damage sustained by reason of interference with property or business through the exercise by the Crown of rights and duties in the Defence of the Realm. This principle of compensation has been applied ever since in the case of land and buildings, both those requisitioned under the Defence of the Realm Regulations and, indirectly, those taken by agreement, since the rents arranged in the latter cases were based on the sums which would have been awarded&apos; had compulsory powers been used. The terms of reference of the Commission preclude the granting of compensation Cor indirect loss or damage.4. The question of compensation was discussed in the House of Commons on the Second Reading of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1915, and in the course of the debate the present Prime Minister, in outlining the proposals of the Government for establishing the Duke Commission, said : &quot; I do not think you can therefore hope to have the same complete measure of compensation which you would enforce in times of peace, where you take one. mans property for the benefit of the public. After all, this is for the general defence of the realm.&quot; (See Official Reports, vol. 70, col. 1460). And subsequently on the debate on the adjournment for the Easter Recess, the names of the Commissioners and the terms of reference were communicated to the House, which, as no criticism was offered, must be taken to have been generally accepted by them.   (See Official Reports, vol. 70, col. 1846.)5. The position of the Crown with regard to legal liability for compensation in respect of commandeered lands or buildings was first raised in the Shoreham Aerodrome case, in which the Court of. first instance and Court of Appeal both decided that there was no legal liability. When the case was argued in the House of Lords, however, doubts as to the correctness of this view were expressed by certain members of that tribunal, and this case was ultimately settled on the basis that the land should be deemed to have been taken under the Defence Act, 1842, and that compensation should be paid on the basis of the Lauds&apos; Clauses Acts. This caused considerable doubt as to the position of the Crown, and the point was again raised in the De Keyser&apos;s Hotel case, in which a judgment in favour of the Crown by the Court of first instance was reversed by the Court of Appeal, who held that, although the buildings in question had been commandeered for war purposes, the owners were entitled to compensation under the old Defence Act, 1842, which, in effect, means compensation on the basis of the Lands&apos; Clauses Acts. That case is now under appeal to the House of Lords, but it is not anticipate! 1 that judgment will be given before next year. In the meantime, claimants are naturally reluctant to submit their claims to the Losses Commission, and the administrative position is one of great difficulty, *as, should the House of Lords decide, against the Crown, there would be a general demand which would be very difficult to resist, for the re-opening of claims which have been dealt with on the loss basis. These claims, if re-opened, would involve the re-assessment of an enormous number of cases which the Department would be unable to check, as they would not now be in a position to obtain the necessary evidence, while the additional cost to the State might well run into millions.6. In the case of the Cannon Brewery Company v. Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) a case of acquisition as opposed to temporary occupation the Courts decided that the prerogative of the Crown did not apply to the action of the Board and that the Company were entitled to compensation on the basis laid down in the Lands&apos; Clauses Acts, in respect of.licensed premises ,compulsorily acquired under the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1915.7. In 1916 a Defence of the Realm Regulation (No. 2 B) was made giving certain Government Departments power to take possession of war material, food, forage and stores of any description, and in 1917 an amendment was made defining the principles to be applied in arriving at the price to be paid for such articles (see Appendix A). The price was not necessarily to be the market price, but the reasonable cost to the owner plus the rate of profit usually earned in respect of similar goods before the war. This, it will be seen, is a departure from the principle of compensation on the loss basis. A similar basis of compensation is laid down in Regulation No. 7 in regard to the output, of factories requisitioned by the Government.8. Under Regulation 2 B the. War Department have requisitioned enormous quantities of wool tops, hides and leather, and the principles of compensation there laid down have been applied. If it is ultimately held that the Regulation, in so far as it lays down these principles of compensation, is ultra vires the Defence of the Realm Acts, it follows that the Goverment Departments which have acted on this Regulation will(7903)
find themselves in an extremely difficult position. A Petition of -Right (the Newcastle Breweries case) is now pending, in which a claim is being made in respect of the compulsory requisitioning of rum by the Admiralty, where the question of the vires of the principle of compensation is being expressly raised.9. The Committee were informed that with a view to disposing of the doubts which had arisen with regard to the validity of this Regulation, a suggestion had been made that some words should be inserted in the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill, in order to validate retrospectively the principles laid down in it for the assessment of compensation. As, however, the matter was the subject of pending litigation, the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown was asked, and they advised that the better course would be to let the issue raised in the Newcastle Breweries case be decided, as they did not think it desirable to introduce retrospective legislation. No action therefore was taken to deal with this matter in the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill.10. Other cases were brought before the Committee by representatives of the Departments concerned in which it appeared necessary that provision should be made to deal with claims for compensation. These cases fall within the following categories : (a.) Claims of shipowners for consequential loss arising out of the compulsoryrequisitioning of their vessels, (o.) Claims for indirect damage or loss, which the Defence of the Realm LossesCommission held to be outside their jurisdiction.11. With regard to cases falling under (a) of the preceding paragraph, the Admiralty, by virtue of a Royal Proclamation, dated the 3rd August, 1914, have powers to requisition ships within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom for such period as may be necessary, on condition that the owners of such ships receive payment for their use and for services rendered during their employment in Govern-ment service, together with compensation for loss or damage thereby occasioned. A Board of Arbitration (known as Lord Mersey&apos;s Board) was subsequently constituted to assess the sums to be paid to shipowners in accordance with agreement. Lord Mersey, the Chairman of the Board, ruled that &quot; compensation for loss or damage thereby occasioned&quot; means compensation for the loss of or damage to the requisitioned ship, and excludes claims for indirect or consequential damage and special claims in respect of such damage brought by shipowners before the Board were after enquiry rejected.12. The principle of the rates of hire, upon which the &quot;Blue Book&quot; rates adopted by the Board are based, is that shipowners should receive a rate affording a fair commercial return on a pre-war capital value of their vessels, irrespective of the freight market, though the enormous increase in the cost of running ships rendered it necessary to increase these rates substantially in March. 1918.13. Shipowners as a whole have not been unwilling to submit cases of dispute to the Mersey Board, but it is by no means clear, since the De Keysers Hotel case, whether they would not have a legal right to claim compensation from the Crown through the machinery of a Petition of Right, if they desire to do so. Some shipowners have, in fact, while accepting Blue Book rates, reserved all their rights against the Crown, and the De Keyser case will no doubt encourage them to proceed by Petition of Right.The Proclamation of the 3rd August deals only with payment &quot; for the use &quot; of the ship, and does not cover permanent acquisition. The Admiralty have in numerous cases requisitioned ships for acquisition; but doubts have been raised as to whether they were entitled to do so under the prerogative. To remove these doubts and to provide for the basis of compensation in such cases a Bill Was drafted in 1917 referring to the Board the determination of the compensation and requiring that it should be assessed on the assumption that the ship was not capable of earning during the war freights at rates in excess of the Blue Book rates. The Bill was not, however, introduced. Consequently a large number of claims for indirect and consequential loss arising.from shipowners being deprived of their vessels are outstanding. The Committee are of opinion that these claims, which run into millions, should either be barred or the principles upon which compensation is to be granted therefor settled. If the De Keyser Hotel case should be thought to throw any doubts on the competence of Lord Mersey&apos;s Board to decide all cases arising under the Proclamation, such doubt should be set at rest and the Board itself given a statutory and exclusive authority.14. The Ministry of Shipping occupies a slightly different position to that of the Admiralty with regard to the requisitioning of ships. Under the Act creating the office
of Shipping Controller, Regulations may be made under the Defence of the Realm Act conferring upon the Controller such powers as may be necessary for carrying out the duties of iris office. Such Regulations have, in fact, been made and empower him inter alia to requisition ships or to require owners to place ships at his disposal, and such Regulations expressly provide (in the same terms as the Proclamation of the 3rd August, 1914), that disputes as to compensation shall be decided by Lord Mersey&apos;s Board. It is thought, therefore, that as regards ships requisitioned by the Shipping Controller, Lord Merseys Board has statutory jurisdiction, but it by no means follows that the Courts would hold that the board&apos;s jurisdiction is an oxclusive one, and that the principles upon which that Board have acted in assessing compensation, are correct. * To this extent, therefore, the same observations apply as in the case of ships requisitioned by the Admiralty. The Ministry of Shipping have not requisitioned ships for acquisition.15. The Defence of the Realm Losses Commission will not entertain claims for losses to shipowners, holding that in view of the existence of the Mersey Board they are &quot;otherwise provided for&quot; within the terms&quot; of the Commissions warrant, but they have entertained claims by persons interested in the requisition of ships other than the owner, such as charterers, cargo owners and others, though in the majority of cases the claims have failed because the losses were considered to be indirect. If the rigid rule that compensation can only be claimed for direct loss is upset by the De Keyser Hotel case or other decisions of the Court, claims by charterers and merchants whose business has been interfered with by the requisition of ships are likely to be immense.16. As regards (b) of paragraph 10 the action taken by the military authorities in Ireland during the rebellion of 1916 and at other times has given rise to a number of claims in respect of damage to, and the requisitioning of, property. Although many of these claims have been dealt with either by the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission or by the Dublin Property Losses Committee a special Committee set up to award compensation for losses sustained in Dublin during the rebellion several have been rejected by these bodies or reduced by them, either on the ground that the claims did not fall within&apos; their jurisdiction, or for some other reason. These rejected claims, and claims which have not so far been brought forward, may mature into civil actions in Ireland, where it is thought that juries would not be unsympathetic.Another class of claims which will arise in Ireland are those on the action taken by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland in the exercise of their powers for enforcing the cultivation of land with a view to maintaining the food supply of the country under Defence of the Realm Regulations 2 L, 2 M and 2 P. A large number of such claims are still outstanding, and these should either be barred or the basis of compensation settled.There are cases of a similar nature in England, where claims have either been rejected, not fully satisfied, or not dealt with by the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission. It is anticipated that a considerable number of actions will be started in England in respect of these claims.17. In these circumstances the Committee are impressed with the importance of arriving at a conclusion as to whether the principles of compensation applied during the war should be validated retrospectively, or their validity left for decision by the Courts of Justice. Having regard to the opinion expressed by the Law Officers in the Newcastle Breweries case (see paragraph 9) the Committee did not at first feel justified in recommending validating legislation which would reverse the decision given in the De Keyser Hotel case, and would be contrary to the opinion&apos; expressed by the Law Officers. The Solicitor-General, who attended the later meetings of the Committee, stated, however, that, as a result of hearing the arguments put forward by the departments concerned, the Law Officers had come to the conclusion that as the question was mainly one of policy, the Committee should not hesitate by reason of the opinion they had previously expressed, to recommend that the question should be dealt with in a comprehensive manner on the broad facts, notwithstanding that any legislation might retrospectively affect cases already the subject of litigation.18. The Committee feel that they cannot satisfactorily proceed with the drafting of the Bill without first obtaining the decision of the War Cabinet on the policy to be adopted. Although the cases referred to above fall into separate categories, the point to be decided in each case is the same, namely, whether a legal right to compensation is to be recognized in respect of loss of or damage to property or business in the United Kingdom occasioned by the exercise or purported exercise of rights, powers, or duties, under the prerogative of the Crown and the Defence of the Realm
\Acts and Regulations, and if so upon what principle such compensation is to be assessed.19. The principles on which compensation has been assessed are (a) in the case of the requisitioning of ships : Freights based on pre-war rates with the addition of&quot; a liberal percentage ; (b) in the case of goods requisitioned under Regulation 2 B and output of factories under Defence of the Realm Regulation 7 :-Cost price plus reasonable profit; and (c) in other cases : The amount of direct loss.With regard to (a) the Blue Book rates were settled by a Committee of shipowners. with  regard to (b) the principle laid down in Regulations 2 B and 7 was the only feasible method of preventing exorbitant claims, especially in the case of commodities of which the greater part were required lor war purposes, as the purchases by the Government necessarily put up market prices. With regard to (c) this principle of compensation cannot be said to be unreasonable since the land or property was damaged or requisitioned as the case may be for the general benefit of the community during a time of national emergency, and there appears to be no logical reason why the person suffering the damage or loss should receive compensation on a profiteering basis, which would be the case if the compensation awarded was based on the Lands&apos; Clauses Acts in respect of land and on the market price in respect of goods. On the other hand, the fact must not be overlooked that owners who were fortunate enough not to have their property requisitioned were able to take advantage of the enhanced prices prevailing.20. It is clear that as matters now stand no claims for compensation for the taking of or damage to land and buildings, can be settled until the De Keyser&apos;s Hotel case is finally determined; if this case and the Newcastle Breweries case are decided against the Government innumerable claims will be sprung upon them running into many millions of pounds, and there will be a strong moral claim by persons who-have accepted the awards of the Defence- of the Realm Losses Commission to have their cases re-opened.21. The Committee do not fail to appreciate the strength of the opposition to-any validating legislation which would have the effect of setting aside legal decisions already given and depriving claimant of rights which they assume, or may have been led to believe, they possess. At the same time they do not consider that claimants who refuse compensation on the basis accepted in the majority of cases should benefit by such action. Serious consequences must ensue from the wholesale multiplication of claims against the Crown which in a large number of cases it would be impossible for the Crown to bring evidence to rebut.22. Alternative clauses have been drafted by Parliamentary Counsel to provide for the matters above referred to, and are set out with a covering memorandum by Sir Frederick Liddell in Appendix B.23. Decisions of the War Cabinet are, therefore, urgently required as to whether (a.) All recourse to the Courts of Law should be prohibited in cases of loss or damage occasioned by the exercise of the prerogative rights of the Crown or of the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Acts.(6.) The principles of compensation on which the Board of Arbitration in the case of shipping and the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission in other cases have hitherto acted should be retrospectively validated.(c.) In the event of (a) and (6) being decided affirmatively which, if either, of the clauses set out in Appendix B should be followed.PEEL, Chairman.EDWARD TROUP. F. F. LIDDFLL. CLAUD SCHUSTER. E.

APPENDIX A.EXTRACT FROM REGULATION 2 B DEALING WITH COMPENSATION TO BE PAID FOR THEREQUISITION OP GOODS.&quot;Where any goods, possession of which, has been so taken, are acquired by the Admiralty, Army Council or Air Council or the Minister of Munitions, the price to be paid in respect thereof shall in default of agreement be determined by the tribunal by which claims for compensation under these regulations are, in the absence of any express provision to the contrary, determined.In determining such price regard need not be had to the market price, but shall be had (a.) If the goods are acquired from the grower or producer thereof, to the cost of production and to the rate of profit usually earned by him in respect of similar goods before the war and to whether such rate of profit was unreasonable or excessive, and to any other circumstances of the case.(b.) If the goods are acquired from any person other than the grower or producer thereof, to the price paid by such person for the goods and to whether such price was unreasonable or excessive, and to the rate of profit usually earned in respect of the sale of similar goods before the war, and to whether such rate or profit was unreasonable or excessive, and to any other circumstances of the case; so, however, that if the person from whom the goods are acquired himself acquired the the goods otherwise than in the usual course of his business, no allowance, or an allowance at a reduced rate, on account of profit shall be made.Provided that where by virtue of these regulations or any order made thereunder the sale of the goods -at a price above any price fixed thereunder is prohibited the price assessed under this regulation shall not exceed the price so fixed.APPENDIX B.PROVISIONS AS TO COMPENSATION FOR REQUISITIONING OF AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY.The two clauses set out below are suggested as alternative methods of dealing with claims for compensation for the exercise, during the war, of the prerogative and of powers under the Defence of the Realm Acts.Both clauses absolutely bar all proceedings of the courts, and would render void all actions already commenced, such as the De Keyser Hotel case and the Newcastle Breweries case.First alternative. They differ, inasmuch as the first alternative gives no right to compensation, but leaves payment of compensation to be made ex gratia, and leaves undetermined the tribunals by which the amounts to be paid as compensation are to be assessed. It would be open to the Government under the clause to extend the terms of reference of the Losses Commission and the Mersey Board of Arbitration so as to include compensation for direct ioss. Probably, if it is determined that compensation is to be paid for indirect loss, it would be well to add words showing such intention, such as the following: &quot; and any such tribunal may include in their assessment of compensation, compensation for indirect as well as direct loss or damage.&quot;At the present moment the terms of reference to the Losses Commission exclude from their jurisdiction cases &apos;: otherwise provided for.&quot; The effect of the clause barring all legal remedies would extend the scope of their jurisdiction, inasmuch as there would be no cases otherwise provided for. The clause as drawn will include claims for compensation for the acquisition of property by the Liquor Control board&apos;d, as that property has been acquired in pursuance of powers conferred by regulations made under an enactment relating to the defence of the Realm.Second alternative. The second alternative, after taking away all rights of recourse to the courts, gives a specific right to claim compensation based on definite principles by specified arbitration tribunals. In some cases under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, e.g., Regvdations 2 B, 2 C and 7, both the principle&apos; on which compensation is to be assessed and the tribunal by which it is to be assessed are laid down ; in others, e.g., Regulation 2 L, the tribunal only is specified. The clause preserves the special principles and special tribunals for the assessment of compensation in cases to which the regulations in question relate. The clause also preserves the provisions of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act in cases where land has been acquired under that Act. Apart from these special provisions the clause proposes to divide claims for compensation into two categories, those relating to ships and those relating to other property. All cases of compensation for damage relating to the requisitioning of ships, whether for temporary use or for permanent acquisition, are to be dealt with by the Mersey Board of Arbitration ; the compensation for the use of ships being limited to the payment of what are known as the Blue Book rates, and the compensation in the case of acquisition being fixed according to the value of the ship, on the assumption that the ship could not, during the war, have earned rates in excess of the Blue Book rates. In other cases the assessment tribunal will, under the clause, be the Losses Commission, aiid the principle on which compensation is to be assessed will bo the principles on which that Commission have hitherto acted, i.e., the loss basis.The second alternative form of the clause is applicable only to the United Kingdom. If it is adopted, -special provision would have to be made for adapting the clause to the circumstances of India and the various colonies.
First Alternative.No notion or other legal procoeding shall be instituted in any court of law fco recover damages or compensation in respect of the exerciso or purported exorcise dating and for the purposes of the present war, of any prerogative right of His Majesty or of :ny power under any enactment relating to the defence of the Realm, or any regulation or order made thereunder, and if any such proceeding has boon instituted, whether before or after the passing of this Act, it shall bo discharged and become void ;Provided that nothing in this section shall prevent applications being made to any special tribunal which may have been or may be established, whether by statute or otherwise, for assessing compensation in respect of any loss or damage occasioned by tho exercise or purported exercise of any such right or power as aforesaid.Second Alternative.1. No action or other legal proceeding shall be instituted in any court of law to recover damages or compensation in respect of the exercise, or purported exercise, during and for the purposes of the present war, of any prerogative right of His Majesty or of any power under any enactment; relating to the defence of the Realm, or any regulation or order made thereunder, and if any such proceeding has been instituted, whether before or after the passing of this Act, it shall be discharged and become void.Provided that any person who has suffered any direct and substantial loss in consequence of the exercise or purported exercise of any such right or power as aforesaid shall be entitled to compensation assessed on the principles and by the tribunal hereinafter mentioned.2. The compensation payable shall be assessed in accordance with the following principles : (i.) Where, under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, any special principle for assessment of compensation is contained in the regulation, compensation shall be assessed in accordance with that principle.(ii.) Where the compensation is payable for the use of a ship, it shall be in accordance with the principles adopted by the Board of Arbitration, constituted under the proclamation issued on the 3rd August, 1914.(iii.) Where the compensation is payable in respect of the acquisition of a ship, it shall be assessed onthe assumption that the ship was not, during the war, capable of earning freight at rateshigher than such rates as aforesaid, (iv.) Where the compensation is payable in respect of land acquired under the Defence of the Realm(Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, it shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions of thatAct as amended by any subsequent enactment, (v.) In any other case the compensation shall be assessed in accordance with the principles uponwhich the Commission appointed by His Majesty (commonly known as the Defence of the realm Losses Commission) has hitherto acted in cases where no special provision is made asto the assessment of compensation.3. The tribunal for assessing compensation shall, where by any of the Defence of the Realm Regulations any special tribunal is prescribed, be that tribunal, and where land has been acquired under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, be the tribunal to which claims for compensation are by that Act as amended by any subsequent enactments, to be referred, and in cases where the property in question is a ship be the said Board of Arbitration, and in any other case be the said Defence of the Realm Losses Commission.F.
