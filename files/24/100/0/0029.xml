The Cabinet, decided on November 19th 1919. that the Petroleum Executive should be responsible for exercising a general oontrbl over oil questions, and should be placed under the charge.of the Under Secretary of State responsible for the Department of Overseas Trade.Under the Petroleum (Production) Act,, 1918, the Minister of Munitions is the responsible authority for granting Yioences to search and bore the Petroleum within the United Kingdom and is also responsible for the finanoial arrangements under the agreement with Messrs, Pearson.Ahout a year ago, it was arranged that the petroleumv -Executive should aot for the Ministry of Munitions (the Director/Vof the for&amp;er reporting direct to the Minister) in the admin-, istratloh of the Pearson Agreement.As a result of the Cabinet decision of November 19th last this position has  now become both anomalous and unsatisfactory from the point of view of Ministerial control,   tfhder it the Ministry of Munitions is responsible for aooounting for expenditure in respect of the  1,000,000 voted by Parliament, but has no effective means of directly watching that expenditure, is not responsible for policy, and is in fact being oororoitted to liabilities in respeot of special agreements arising out of the Pearson borings, which are   negotiated  by another body entirely responsible to the Under^ Secretary of State for the Department of Overseas Trade. A further question arises as to which Minister should v^be responsible for the Bill, already drafted with the   object of vesting in the Crown the property in petroleum in the United Kingdom.   Hitherto the responsibility for dealing with the draft Bill has devolved upon the Ministry of Munitions,I) HOIffi PRODUCTION Off OIL, JMemo by Deputy Minister of Munitions of War.
Sir Hamar Greenwood is willing to assume all the responsibilties (including financial) of the Ministry of Munitions under the Pearson Agreement and the 1918 Act, but the Treasury are unable to agree that financial responsibility -should be transferred, and take the view that the Petroleum Executive is a temporary department, the funds for which are provided under the Temporary Commissions Vote for which tjia Treasury Account and that Sir Eamar Greenwood has no statutory authority under the Petroleum Product ion Act.&apos;Under Sub-section (2) of Section (5) of the Act in question, however., provision is made for the transfer by Order in Council to any Government Department or. Author it y^ toll or any of the powers conferred by the Act on the Minister of Munitions,It is submitted that the Cabinet decision of November 19th last should be reviewed, and that the responsibility for the whole administration (including polioy and finance) should be placed under one Department. If it be considered preferable that the powers conferred by the 1918 Aot should continue to be discharged by the Minis &quot;try of Munitions, then that Department should be made responsible both for the Petroi-equalise Executive itself and the policy to be adopted in so far as the home production of oil is concerned.    If, on the other hand, it be decided that the above decision of the Cabinet should not be reversed: then authority is sought for an Order in Council, transferring all the powers conferred by the 1918 Act to the Department of Overseas Trade,   Such a transfer would not, of course, affect the question of the purchase of oil required for the Government service,(Sgd)    3?, Kellaway,March 10th 19J?-0e
