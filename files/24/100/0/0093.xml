CABINET

HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.

Congestion of the Docks in respect of Imported Meat.

Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.

1. Steps are being taken in collaboration with the Ministry of Food to give effect to (a) (c) and (d) of the Recommendations on page 4 and the result will be reported in due course.

2. As regards the question of disposing of some of the surplus supplies by canning, this does not appear to be practicable on any extensive scale, as frozen meat is not very suitable for canning, while there is little canning done in this country, and Germany would probably have to import tinplates before she would be in a position to can this meat, oven if she so desired, which is problematical.

3. With reference to the Memo. C.P.838 of the Ministry of Food, I agree that it will be difficult to increase the amount of consumption of imported meat distributed through internal transport to any great extent under present transport conditions - whatever the price may be, - and also that the present prices are not excessive.

4. As regards the suggestion to divert 50,000 tons to the Continent, the Board, as stated in ? 2, are doing what is possible in this direction, but it is doubtful whether any substantial quantity can be disposed of in this way, and finance will undoubtedly be a difficulty.

5. The cost to the Exchequer of selling our supplies of Mutton at 7d and of lamb at l/- per lb. would be about Â£3,500,000 and I do not think this would be justifiable,
at any rate until we have seen the effect of the reductions in Mutton prices by 11/2 per lb. which only came into effect this week. A further reduction of 2d would not in my opinion lead to any proportionate increase of consumption, and might seem to support unjustified statements as to the quality of the meat.
