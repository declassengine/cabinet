CHURCHILL.9th March, 1920.Commission Militaire Interallied de Controle, British Section,Berlin,ith March, 1920.Dear Marsh,I enclose two reports, one of an interview I had with Ludendorff and one with Hoffmann. The latter only took place this morning so I have only had time to roughly indicate the conversation.I was asked to have this interview. It was at no request of any of us that it was given. I think the case is of such immense importance that I take the liberty of suggesting that Mr. Churchill should give consideration to the request that he should come and see about it.Yours sincerely,W. Stewart Roddie.REPORT OF INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL HOFFMANN. By Lieut.-Colonel W. Stewart&apos;Roddie.This morning I had an hours&apos; talk with General Hoffmann. Hoffmann is the Russian expert and is by m my considered the &quot; brainiest&quot; soldier Germany produced in the war. In many respects his views differed from those of Ludendorff In such cases I accept Hoffmanns as being the sounder.Hoffmann is as firmly convinced as Ludendorff of the absolute necessity of meeting the trouble, but his ideas are more practical at the moment. He realizes the impossibility of an offensive, and his suggestion is that the present 250,000 men be left. This will protect the frontier until such time as the other nations see the necessity for taking further steps.   Then this 250,000 could be augmented by German volunteers.He cannot consider the question of Germany becoming a menace by joining with Russia. That could only be possible under the same circumstances as Ludendorff pointed out. So long as Britain has a Fleet and Germany none, this question is not worth considering. In his opinion there would be no difficulty in getting the Germans to fight Bolshevism.   &quot; They would fight France again to-day, such is the hatred.&quot;The people would need no incentive such as the concession of Upper Silesia, Posen, &amp;c. That question will right itself some day. He believes that the Entente will soon realize the utter stupidity of such parts of the Peace Treaty as deal with this question. Poland, with nothing but debts, an independent country ! If only experts would come and see for themselves.The propaganda of the Bolshevists is extraordinarily clever. They are now working on Nationalistic propaganda. A united Russia. Their agents have been here to Hofimann and other German Generals and have promised to work only against Britain. In a short time Britain will be so undermined that Germany need think no more of the Treaty of Versailles.Hoffmann discredits the Bolshevists believes their international policy to be unchanged.    Has known all the leaders.   Was at Brest-Litovsk, and declares it(B20/131)  43  3/20   H&amp;S   y031wo
would be easier to believe that Mahomet could have been baptized a Christian than that the Lenin and Trotsky policy can ever change. &quot; They are the most dangerous liars in the world. When Lenin weeps he is strongest; when he declares that he is conquering, be sure something is weak somewhere.&quot;Hoffmann is not convinced of the Reds attacking Poland so soon. They intend to finish the Denikin Army first and make sure of the south. The Bolshevist activities never cease. &quot;I am as convinced that there will be war shortly as I am that I am sitting here. And it will be either you and us against the Bolshevist or we and the Bolshevists against Versailles.   No other alternative.&quot;Hoffmanns plan is: Stem it in the meantime with the present German Army. But this 250,000 army must be given a definite lease of life, otherwise no one will remain in it except the useless and dangerous. Now we have only till June. Result everyone looking for another job. Then eventually when the nations realize what must be done-increase this army to 500,000, armoured trains, tanks, heavy artillery. Probably with the British and French. Perfectly willing, as his colleagues would be, to serve under either French or British Command.  There would be no difficulties there.Take St. Petersburg, Moscow ; set up a Government. Lay hands on all the money, treasure, &amp;c. Bolshevists can do nothing without money. Their propaganda would stop. Thus their most dangerous weapon would be rendered useless. Then commence to reconstruct Russia with Britain and France. This is the only possible way France can ever be reconstructed. No other way of reparation from Germany. &quot; It can be done, it must be done, and I believe I may say it will be done. The world is not yet so devoid of sense that this can be ignored. I think if Mr. Churchill came here, or some of your other great men, a considerable step in the right direction would be taken.&quot;W. Stewart Roddie.INTERVIEW WITH FIELD-MARSHAL LUDENDORFF. By Lieut.-Colonel W. Stewart RoivDiE.3rd March, 1920.Ludendnrff received me with every courtesy. His demeanour during the whole interview, which lasted two hours, was characterised by unvarying earnestness and solemnity. I assured him that nothing of what he said wouid be published in the Press, but that of course I must be at liberty to report to my superior officers anything I considered necessary.   He at once agreed, and said : &quot; It is because I want you to do so and. if you can, to place the matter plainly before your King and Ministers, that I ask you to listen to my views.We are standing at the cross-roads, and a decision has to be come to. Either the world is going down under Bolshevism or the world is going to kill it. I, who speak to you, am only a private individual, but I was a soldier, and one with some experience, and 1 pledge you my word that, when I say an army is required, Germany has no other motive with regard to that army than of using it for the one and only purpose of facing the Russian menace. \As we are, we can do nothing. The country will not fight, and we have nothing to fight with. We shall have to be equipped and backed by the Entente. The difficulties you point out I thoroughly realize, but the situation is of such appalling seriousness, that such difficulties will have to be faced. It will first mean great propaganda. How well your country can accomplish that part, we. alas, have learned to our cost. Former enemies will, for their common good, have to fight side by side. It will mean a complete reconstruction of the peoples ideas, almost a turning inside out of their minds, but it will have to be.   It, or the &apos; horror.&apos;How are we going to persuade the nations of the reality of the danger ? You have many sensible people in England, and in France su:h are also to be found. If these people are strong as well as sensible, they will see the danger and meet it, but there is not a month, scarcely a week, to lose.The Red Army is now only prevented from entering and overrunning Poland because of the state of the ground, but in May this will be different and by that time they will have, in all probability, prepared the way so well, by propaganda, that they may be able to occupy Warsaw and establish the Soviet there without having to fight at all.Then think of the state in which this country is. Starvation in two months time. What better soil for the seeds, already planted, of Bolshevism 1   The people know we
all know that the Peace of Versailles makes our existence absolutely impossible, and if these terms are to be adhered to, we shall have to turn to the only door left open to us. Whether it will lead through the ashes of the world to something eventually better than the prospect with which we are faced, God only knows, but it is the Only alternative.Many of my former colleagues are convinced that the time has passed when the evil can bo stopped, and seriously contemplate going forward on the wave, I, myself ? No. I do not think it is too late, that is why I am speaking to you. I also will tell you, that so long as I see any other way out for my country, I shall not join the Bolshevists.&quot;I asked Ludendorff how he would propose to deal with the matter.&quot;Anything but sudden death, he said, need not be considered. First of all our people would, only fight on the understanding that it was to be one blow. To leave an army inactive, or for any space of time there, would mean the utter corruption and demoralization of that army.&quot;&quot; But,&quot; I asked him, &quot; Do you think you would have difficulty in getting your people to fight again ?&quot;&quot; Great difficulty,&quot; he said, &quot; unless they were promised something very substantial as a reward.&quot;&quot; Such as   &quot; ? I asked him. &apos; &quot; Such as Upper Silesia and the Polish country. We cannot do without those. The map of Europe will have to be altered there. This is absolutely clear to every well informed sensibly thinking man. We shall ask nothing of Alsace, that we leave entirely, but this other we cannot live without. We would, he continued, require an army, roughly estimated, of about a million men, France 150,000, Britain 250,000, Germany 500,000.&quot;&quot; But,&quot; I said, supposing only supposing such an arrangement were ever considered, what guarantee would we have that as soon as you had this army, munitions and equipment you would not join with Eussia and wipe out the French and British Army ?&quot;&quot; Firstly, you would have Ludendorff&apos;s word.&quot;&quot; Excellenz,&quot; I said, &quot; neither I, nor possibly has anyone else, ever had cause to doubt the word of Ludendorff, but do you honestly think that, under the circumstances, that would be a sufficient and acceptable guarantee to the nations. That you would keep your word I do not for a moment doubt, but this would have to be the guarantee of a nation, not of a man.&quot;&quot; The nation would give guarantees.   There would be shares in our industries, &amp;c.&quot;&quot;Also,&quot; I said, &quot;you know that a great mistrust exists towards Germany. Guarantees have been ignored before this, Treaties have been only &apos;scraps of paper&apos; ? &quot;&quot; I was going to add,&quot; said Ludendorff, &quot;that by the time people had made up their minds that the evil had to be faced, the fact that we would have a common necessity to make a common fight for the common good would pave the way to a solution of such difficulties.&quot;&quot;An International Army would. mean an International Staff,&quot; and, I added, probably a Supreme Command.&quot;Ludendorff pulled himself up and stared at me.&quot; Oh, yes !   Perhaps, it might have to be so.&quot;&quot; Now, you probably would lead the German Army?&quot;&quot; It might be so.&quot;&quot; Well&apos; may I ask you this question ? It is a difficulty that will have to be solved if your suggestion is acted upon would you be willing to place yourself under the command of Marshal Foch.&quot;(Pause) &quot; I&apos; don&apos;t think that could be done. The people would not stand it. They would not fight. There is too much bitterness between these two countries. No, I fear it would be impossible.&quot;&quot; Then you don&apos;t think, Excellenz, that the common necessity to make a common fight for the common good would be quite up to that standard of effectiveness. Then, supposing you wrere asked to act under a British Command ? &quot;&quot;That,&quot; said Ludendorff. after he had thought lor a moment, &quot;would not be impossible. Under Sir Louglas Haig-yes, I could, and I think the German people would.&quot;&quot; How would the German Government look on such a scheme,&quot; I asked. &quot; The German Government the present German Government could not carry out such a scheme.    There are far too many men of no experience in&apos;it.    This
Government will change, The strong useful men will remain, but the days of this Government are, I think, numbered.&quot;&quot; Don&apos;t you think the recent concessions with regard to the &apos; Auslieferungsfrage&apos; (trial question) strengthened their position ?&quot;&quot; Possibly though we look on the admission of their inability to hand us over as weakness, not strength. At the same time any gain of strength on that score has been terribly out-balanced by the Erzberger scandal. There will be a big change in the Government soon, and if Britain realizes, the seriousness of the situation to be dealt with, it will direct Germany in their choice of Government. Such a problem as this, a Government composed of possibly honest, well-meaning, but)inexperienced men, would be absolutely incompetent to deal with. &apos; Esfelilt die Menschen und die Welthenntnis&apos; (They lack knowledge both of humanity and of the world). It would probably mean a Dictator.&quot;&quot; Can you get Mr. Churchill to come over here, even for a few days, incognito if he likes? Let us talk to him, the danger is so great, that we must leave no stone unturned.I beg you to go and see your people, tell them, persuade them, and if they will not believe me through you, ask them for Gods sake to come here.Don&apos;t be lulled into a feeling of security by the lack of superficial evidence. The Bolshevist is always worst when he is quietest. We know that the people here have had instructions from Russia to remain quite quiet in the meantime, to disclaim all connection with the Soviet, to put no obstacle in the way of the complete reduction of the German troops. Meantime, the Spartacists and Communists are concealing arms all over the country. Even many of the &apos; Right&apos; are foolish enough to do this, imagining thai: they are serving Germany by attempting to evade the Control. This I consider misguided, for the little they could conceal can be of no importance, while the amount of mistrust thereby aroused may be of the very gravest importance, not only to Germany, but to the whole world. ,You can, perhaps, realize that it is not pleasant for me to have to plead with you, but I do it, and I shall go on doing it, and be justified in doing it, until I have persuaded your people of the true position of the world, or until 1 feel I have done everything in my power to persuade them until I have brought them here and made them see that we and they are no longer climbing up a mountain, but are actually moving down the slope of a crater. Only a combined effort can stop us, but it must be made now.The first thing you must do is to get rid of any suspicion that our motive is other than what I tell you it is. The consequences of carelessness or dilatoriness in dealing with this will be so awful that one dare scarcely contemplate them.Who can be blind to the aims of Bolshevism with regard to India and the East ? This Bolshevism is like a serpent in the grass. Because it does not raise its head and rattle, we say, &apos; Oh ! it&apos;s probably harmless,&apos; and we don&apos;t even move out of the wTay. We do nothing to protect ourselves.Do something, for God&apos;s sake.   Let us work together over this.   Send someone here.   Not Sir Douglas Haig.   My old colleagues would look on a meeting between him and me with the gravest suspicion at this time, but surely Mr. Churchill could come   -incognito.&quot;W. Stewart Roddie.I make little comment on this interview, I have always written of the &quot;Danger&quot; and have believed in it.LudendorfT has the reputation of being a man of his word.I believe he meant every word he said. At the same time one realizes that Bolshevism provides the one chance there is of LudendorfT becoming a soldier again. (He is no politician.)What was at the back of his mind, although I believe he, himself, did not realize that it played the first role, was, &quot;Germany with Hindenburg as president and Ludendorff as his right-hand man.&quot;The wish, to a certain extent, was probably farther to the thought, but it would be criminal to use this as a strong argument against the general question..If it could be arranged, I am persuaded that a visit by Mr. Churchill would do good in many and important ways. It would probably have to be incognito; there would be no difficulty here.
