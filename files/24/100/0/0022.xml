[Tins Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.(11512;Political Intelligence Department. Foreign Office.Austria/012.MEMORANDUMonAUSTRIAN DOMESTIC POLITICS SINCE THE TREATY OFSAINT GERMAIN.AUSTRIAN domestic politics have been of comparatively little interest and small importance until recently. Several causes contributed to this, chief among them Austria&apos;s preoccupation with her own desperate economic position. The uncertainty as to whether an independent Austria would continue to exist and the desire not to prejudice the country&apos;s position at the Peace Conference also had much influence. Now that the Treaty has been signed and ratified, however, and the prospect of a union with Germany appears very remote, there are many indications that interest in domestic affairs, party developments and the like will become very considerable. The following memorandum is intended to provide a comprehensive view of such questions: 1. Legislative power in Austria at present lies in the hands of the National Assembly. This body was constituted after the break-up of the Monarchy and its mandate extends until February 1921. The party strength of the deputies composing it, based on the election of January 1919, is as follows: Bourgeois Liberals    ...        ...        ...        ...        ...   23Styrian Peasants Christlich-Sozialen Social Democrats Jewish Nationalists Czechs364 70 1 12 Corresponding to the approximate equality indicated above between the Christlich-Sozialen and the Socialists the present Government, which was formed last November, is made up of the following elements-a coalition between the two principal parties .and one or two non-party men Dr. Renner s attempt at a Konzen-trationskabinett including representatives of all parties having tailed:-President	Dr. Karl Seitz.

3. The record of leading members of the Austrian Government is generally known, but a few up-to-date biographical notes may be added : Seitz and Rentier.Both Seitz and Renner were alway s of the Right Wing of the Social Democratic Party. The latter, whose Markist and other writings, written in past under the name of Rudolf Springer, are well known, was, until the Revolution, a believer in the fedenalisation of the Dual Monarchy and an upholder of German predominance. He has played by far the most prominent part since the events of November 1918, Seitz standing in the background, and in any case having the anomalous position of being head of the State without actual title. The attitude of both men towards the Extreme Left has in public been uncompromising, but Renner is not a strong man, and his replacement has more than once been suggested in Austrian political circles on that account, a possible successor being Police President Schober, who held this position under the Monarchy but has managed to retain it by sheer force of character. All one can say is that so long as the Socialist-Christlich-Sozialen regime continues Renner is likely to remain its head, but that not very strong intimidation from either the Right or the Left would be sufficient to upset the Government.Dr. Julius Deutsch.The War Minister, Dr. Julius Deutsch, is a Jew who, after the Revolution, took a leading part in creating the Volkswehr and in controlling the Soldatenrdte. Ho also, though not extremist in his views, has shown great weakness in face of the danger of allowing the&apos; Volkswehr to get into the hands of the extremists.Dr. Reiseh.Dr. Reisch, the Finance Minister, is a non-party man. He is Director of the Bodenkreditanstalt, and has the reputation of being a good administrator, though not of very firm or determined character.Of the rest of the Cabinet it is not necessary to say much, beyond pointing out that in certain of the offices, for example, Minister of Justice, Dr. Rank, who is a Salzburger, an obvious attempt has been made to select representatives of the Lander. In general, it should be noted that, although numerically the Government represents a fairly evenly divided combination between Social Democrats and Christlich-Sozialen, it is the former who predominate in the actual importance of the offices held. \4. For some months past, and more particularly of late, when party-political questions have come much moretto the fore, the rift between the Christlich-Sozialen and the Social Democrats in the National Assembly has grown far wider. It ought at the outset to be explained that, although in general it is convenient and not too seriously inaccurate to speak of the two great parties as if they were individual units, there are certain sub-divisions the potential importance of which is not to be under-estimated. In the Social Democratic Party there are three sections. The first is moderate and is represented by Renner and Seitz. The second, fairly represented by Otto Bauer and Friedrich Adler, is less moderate. It has a decided aversion from co-operation with so-called bourgeois parties, holds fast to the worker0&apos; councils, and so forth. It nevertheless believes in Parliamentary action, and some of its leaders&apos; utterances have been opposed to both the; doctrines and tactics of Trotsky and Lenin. In short, the party stands more or less where the German Minority stood before the death of Haase and the decisions of the Leipzig Conference. The ease with which leaders of the party pass into advocates of Bolshevism and the way in which to a certain extent thei party overlaps with the Extremist Party-these complete the parallel. The third section of the party stands outside the National Assembly altogether. Its leaders, chief among them Frey, and its members aie practical Communists, and have lent themselves to every kind of intrigue, first with the Hungarian Communists then with Italians and Germans. The leaders of the middle Social Democratic Party just mentioned would appear to maintain communication with this last and most extreme section. -The Christlich-Sozialen seem to be divided principally on the question of the Anschluss. The main body of the party, although generally rather reticent on the subject, is opposed to union with Germany and hopes, not indeed for the restitution of the Monarchy, but at least for the establishment of a Danubian Confederation.   The two most effective leaders of this main body are Seipel, who
served on the Socialisation Commission with Bauer until disagreement brought about his resignation, and Fink, the present Vice-Chancellor. A group of younger Christlich-Sozialen, however, appears to be making headway under the leadership of Hugelmann. They are in favour of the Anschluss, but what influence they are destined&apos; to have&apos; on the party as a whole cannot very well be foreseen, when the question of relations with Germany has been put so much in the background by the declarations of the Supreme Council. On the main questions which agitate the party the Constitution, socialisation, and the future of the army-no disunion can be noticed; in the differences which arise on these matters with the Social Democrats the party solidarity of the Christlich-Sozialen is likely to be practically complete.5. Prior to a discussion on the future of the parties and on the lines on which&apos; a division or other forms of coalition seem likely, to come, it will be well briefly to review three main problems which, however much in the background generally, are always liable to come into prominence and vitally affect the future of the Austrian State. These are : (a) Bolshevism, (&amp;) the monarchist movement, (c) the Anschluss.(a.) That Bolshevism never succeeded in making headway in a State so desperately situated as Austria may seem at first&apos;sight a little surprising. But the reasons are not difficult to elucidate. In the first place leaders of the Socialist Party, even the more radical among them, always realised the inexpediency of extreme socialisation, not to speak of widespread Soviet organisation. The machinery of the Austrian Social Democrats was, therefore, never placed at the service of Communist propaganda, and the advocates of anything more than a very rudimentary imitation of the Russian Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils system began with a severe handicap. The balance, moreover, was kept by the powerful organisation of the Christlich-Sozialen. backed bv the moral force of the Catholic Church. The Socialists of Vienna knew that any attempt to institute a Bolshevik regime would be followed not only by chaos in Vienna, but by starvation; and, thanks to the Christlich-Sozialen, they never succeeded in capturing the army for Communist ends. An improvement in the situation from &quot;the Communist point of view came with the Hungarian Bolshevik Revolution, which was the means of bringing the badly-organised and ill-financed Bolshevik groups in Austria into touch with Russian Bolshevik propaganda funds. The Bela Kun regime was, however, of short duration, and there was a notable falling-off of Communist activity in Austria on the resumption of power by the Hungarian Christian National Government. There are to-day in Austria three, or perhaps four, main Communist groups, principally divided on personal grounds. (Tomann and Koritschoner are the leaders of one group, for example, Friedlander of another.) These receive funds from the German Spartacists and from the Italian Communists, while they continue to draw moral support from the Hungarian Bolshevik refugees interned at Karlstein. This place has been the* centre of several recent intrigues, at which the Hungarian Government has manifested considerable perturbation. But that these could ever issue in a widespread and successful Bolshevik revolution would appear to be very doubtful.(b.) ,The danger of a Monarchist reaction seems at the moment even more remote. Various allegations at Social Democratic conferences of pro-Hapsburg intrigue have been made, but have never been substantiated. The centre for Austrian Royalist intrigue is Switzerland. Between that country and Schoenbriinn or Gratz there lias been a certain amount of passage to and fro of Monarchist agents, but nothing effective has come of this activity. One reason is no doubt the lack of agreement between the Monarchists, the chief division of opinion being between the ex-Emperor Karl or his son Otto, and Ernst Hohenberg, the eldest son of Franz Ferdinand; a second is the disposition on the part of the Monarchists to await events in Hungary. Should Hungary become a monarchy again and this appears to be certain the result might be to unify such Austrian Monarchist movement as exists.   That is all that can be safely asserted at the present moment.(c.) The latest important political utterance of Dr. Renner, namely that of the 18th February, to his constituents at Purkersdorf. - gave an adequate account of the present position of the Anschluss controversy. Among Social Democrats of the Right, such as Renner himself there is an undoubted determination to obey the decrees of the Supreme Council and carry out the terms of the Peace Treaty, including those which forbid the adhesion of Austria to Germany without permission of the League of Nations. At the same time it is felt that submission to this decision is in the very nature of things conditional on the adequate support by the Entente Powers in the way of raw-material, credits and by diplomatic efforts to break down
the trade barriers which the Slav Succession States and Hungary have set up between themselves and Austria. Austrian Social Democrats, other than what may be called the official group, are whole-heartedly in favour of joining Germany, but see the necessity for reticence. The Christlich-Sozialen are in the main body of the party divided as has been indicated, while in the outlying provinces, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg in particular, they are at least in favour of separation from Vienna, and to a large extent favourable to the idea of joining either Bavaria, as in the first two cases,, or Switzerland, as in the last. Apart from provincial manifestations by Socialists and Christlich-Sozialen alike, the only noteworthy demonstration in favour of joining Germany in the past few months has been that of the Gross-Deutsch Party which called together a great meeting in Vienna, at the end of January. Propaganda from Germany had its influence in this, and it is definitely known that subsidies are regularly paid from German funds for the promotion of the Anschluss idea. The general impression is that apart from the unofficial Social Democrats and their followers the great mass of the Austrian people, including financiers and big business men, have for the time being, given up the idea of union with Germany, and are hoping to see the necessary support forthcoming.from the Entente for the only possible alternative, namely, an economic union of all the former States of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with perhaps the addition of Serbia and Eoumania.6. As soon as attention in Austria began to be turned to domestic questions once more, it was seen that there were three main points likely sooner or later to divide the Coalition. These were: (1) general social policy; (2) the proposals for the new Constitution; and (3) the reorganisation of the army. The Social Democratic Party, of course, stands for the transformation of the capitalist organisation of production into a socialist organisation, based on the principles of the Second International, to which the Austrian Socialist Party still continues officially to adhere. Such differences as there are in the party concern tactics, and not principle. The Christlich-Sozidlen, on the other hand, have a social reform rather than a socialisation programme. They propose to simplify public administration and elaborate certain social laws, such as National Workers&apos; Insurance, on the German model, but will not hear of far-reaching socialisation proposals. The chairmanship of the Socialisation Committee by the Christlich-Sozial leader, Dr. Seipel, really meant that nothing was done. Incidents illustrating the differences between Social Democrats and Christlich-Sozialen are constantly occurring, as last month when the former justified a strike which had been caused by the refusal of a. worker to join a particular Trade Union, the latter denouncing the attempted coercion. It may be noted that there are certain large business interests represented in the Christlich-Sozialen, for example, by Dr. Heinrich Mataja, but that, the ultimate basis of the party being religious and not one of class-interests, it tends to be opportunist and react, like the German Centre Party, to the varying demands of its electorate. There are several exceedingly capable administrators in its ranks and a predominantly Christlich-Sozial central Govern-ment is considered to be not out of the question in the event of fresh elections under the new Constitution.7. Constitutional debates in Austria have long been in abeyance, and have revived only in recent weeks. A Bill, embodying a provisional Constitution, was passed in April, 1919, and various supplementary Bills arising out of this have been presented and accepted from time to time. But the question of a final and definite Constitution was not effectively raised until the last change of Government, when a special Ministry was set under the Christlich-Sozial&apos; deputy, Dr. Mayr, for the purpose of considering it. It was recalled that the life of the present National Assembly expires in February, 1921, that is, that half its mandate, which was principally to prepare the final Constitution of the Republic, has expired. Hence the haste and intensity with which Constitutional proposals have been considered lately. The matter is complicated by centrifugal tendencies in the provinces, Tyrol going so far as to deny the sovereignty of Vienna and proceeding to elaborate a Constitution of its own. The Christlich-Sozialen are disposed, in any eventual Constitution, to grant, considerable concessions to Austria&apos;s nine Lander * allowing local parliaments and* Tinder Dr. Mayr&apos;s scheme this is the number : German West Hungary (BUrgenland), Oarinthia,Lower Austria, Upper Austria,Salzburg, Styria,Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Vienna.
and wide powers of local legislation under the final control of Vienna. The Social Democrats are firm upholders of centralisation and claim that administrative, social and economic questions, food supplies, and national defence come exclusively within the province of the State, and should be subject to uniform organisation throughout the country. There appears at present little chance of reconciling these two views, while to less fundamental details of the draft Constitution, such as the establishment of a Second Chamber on the Swiss model of a Federal Council, irreconcilable Socialist opposition has been declared.8. The differences between the Christlich-Sozialen and Social Democrats over the new Army Bill also spring from the fundamental opposition between centralisation and federalisation. The &quot; reporter &quot; on the Bill in Parliament is the prominent Christlich-Sozial deputy, Dr. Mataja, who is known to be opposed to the Bill in its present form, and in favour of securing the independence of local military administration. The proposed abolition of the Volkswehr, and the determination of non-Socialist politicians to make the army administration entirely non-political, as against the determination of the Soldiers&apos; Councils to make it a weapon of revolution these are further complications, which, taken together with fundamental party differences, may well delay the adoption of the measure until after the attainment of the new Constitution.9. The political future of Austria is very uncertain. This is true no less of the country in its domestic-political than in its foreign-political aspect. The recent attention to home political problems has revealed profound differences between the two main parties, and it would seem that only the emergence of one of these as a predominant political force is likely to bring about stability. Whether it will be the Christlich-Sozialen or the Social-Democrats, it is not easy to prophecy. Both are too evenly balanced in the National Assembly and one must presume in the country to make prediction at all certain; neither, moreover, seems ready for sole responsibility. All one can say is that the party which succeeds in bringing about tolerable economic conditions once more, either by effecting arrangements with the Succession States, by the attraction of foreign capital or a successful union with Germany this will be the party of greatest strength in Austria for a considerable time to come.March 4,1920.o12527] (J
