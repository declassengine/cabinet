	;1 A	Copy No. r--IcBET.	lP.849.	* CABINET.IRISH LAND PURCHASE SCHEME. Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.(1)        Cn t).ie 3rd Instant the Lord Privy Seal gave an affirmative answer to a question addressed to the Prime Minister by Major 0&apos;Neill in the following terms&quot;whether it is the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill for the completion of land purchase in Ireland, to be passed concurrently with the Government of Ireland Bill. as was done in the case of former Home Rule Bills?&quot;.As a Land Purchase Bill is an essentia&apos; part, of the Home Rule settlement it may be expected that on the Second Reading of the Home Rule Bill, the point will be raised that the House is not in a position to deal with that measure until the Government&apos;s proposals for the completion of land purchase have been formulated.(2)        This would appear to be a reasonable cont^rt.^-and in order to meet it, it is necessary that either i?;e Land Purchase Bill should be introduced and circulateu ueiure the Second Reading of the Home Rule Bill or that on the Second Reading a statement should be made outlining the land purchase proposals..   In either case it is essential that steps should be taken at once with the view of arriving at a decision on the principles and details of the land purchase policy.(3)        A scheme for the completion of land purchase was put forward by the Irish Convention and I brought the matter before the Cabinet in a memorandum (C.-P.624) asking for a ruling on the question whether the recommendation of the Con-vention was to be taken as the basis of the Government Land Purchase Scheme.   So far as T am aware no definite ruling has been given upon the point and I would accordingly ask that a sub-committee should be appointed to consider the question and make recommendations to the Cabinet for the purpose of settling at once the lines on which the Bill is to be prepared^(4)        A draft Bill to carry out the Convention^ recom-mendations was prepared by Sir Frederick Liddell In 1918 and I have sent copies to the Land Commission for their observa-tions in anticipation of the setting, up of such a Committee. The Convention1s scheme was based on the financial conditions of 1Q18 and will require to be adjusted to present conditions. Any gCheme must of necessity involve considerable cost which under Clause 22 of the Home Rule Bill must be borne wholly by the exchequers of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland,(Intd)    I.M.I ;ish Office,- S.W.,March 11th. 1920.
