:   2kZSECRET.FOREIGN OFFICE,WHITEHALL. S.W.I., March 4th, 1920,Dear Hankey,In Seotion 3 (a) of the Appendix to the Synopsis of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, approved by the Supreme Council on the 21st February 1920, it was recommended that the islands of Lemnos, Imbros, Samothrace, Tenedos and Mitylene and tho islands of the Sea of Marmora should be demilitarised.2. It has, however, been pointed out, firstly, that north-east of Mitylene there&apos; is also the island of Moskonisi, which is almost as big as Tenedos, and, secondly,.that in the vinicity of these different Islands there are many nameless islets which it seems desirable to cover by the phrasing of the Treaty, 3. I therefore think it well to bring these two points to your attention in order that they may be raised at the Supreme-Council, and, if the Council agree, referred to the Naval and Military Commission for redrafting.Yours sincerely, (Signed)       ROBERT VANSITTART.Lieut.-Colonel Sir ilaurtco Hankey, G.C3.-, Offices of the Cabinet, 2, Whitehall Gardens,POSITION OF TURKISH ISLANDS UNDER TREATY OF PEACE WITH TURKEYCopy of letter from h.r.
