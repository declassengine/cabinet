z* &apos;&quot; &apos;............ **T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCABINETcp.832PRE -WAR /PENSIONS   - THE QUESTION OF INCREASING THEM,I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues, a memorandum which has teen prepared in the Treasury on the question of pre-war pensions.11th March, 19201.     The plight of the pensioners who are in receipt of pensions based on tho scales in force before the increases in pricos reduced the purchasing power of the   by upwards of 50$ 1b one which is bound to command sympathy, and various demands are being pressed for the amelioration of the lot of this class.-    The extreme request which is being made is that all pensions should be increased t* give them their old purchasing power;   other proposals are that graduated relief should bo afforded, so that pensions under the margin of subsistence should be increased in proportion to the rise in the cost of living, the percentage increase diminishing aooording to a sliding soale for pensions above that margin;   the m*st mt&amp;est demand is that help shall be given in &quot;necessitous cases&quot;. 2.     The Treasury views, which are develeped in the succeeding paragraphs- may be summarised as follows :-(a). State pensioners are merely one group of&apos;a large body of people with fixed incomes, (b) Most of the pensioners are able to, and many do,take on ether work and thus are more fortunatelyplaced than many others whose incomes have not . ...   . . .increased.(a) A State pension represents a contribution to a pensionersTreasury,(Intld.) A.C.resources in respect of a number, in many oases avery limited number, of years of service which impliesno understanding that the Stato is bound to supportthe pensioner in his old age.
(d) Any increases granted must-obviously&quot;add to the general burden of taxation, and the benefit to the pensioners would be at the expense, in psrt, of other fixed income people who aro quite as badly hit as the pensioners themselves.(o) The capital cost of bringing all pre-war State pensions up to tho level of the post-war scales would not be less than 50 millions. To raise them&apos; to the equivalent of their former purchasing power would involve a much larger expenditure and moreover wuuld have the effect of treating pre-war pensioners more/2avourably than employees now about to retire;    in addition, municipal and railway pensioners would inevitably require concessions similar to those given to State pensioners which would occasion further very heavy expense to the taxpayer and ratepayer,(f) The Treasury are accordingly not in favour cf increases being granted.(g) If, however, it is. considered expedient forsome relief to be afforded as a compassionate measure, the Treasury would urge that it should be confined to. pensioners proved to be in real distress which it is beyond their own powers reasonably   &quot;to alleviate. 3.     It must bo realised that State pensioners comprise very varied and heterogeneous classes of individuals representing almost all grades in tho social scale, and including such diverse classes as manual labourers (e.g. dockyard workers), postmen, police, soldiers,-2- /sailors
soil ore, teachers end oil ranks up to the moat highly plooed novel and military officers and civil. servants.     The great majority are in the category of low03? paid workers, with responsibility.ons--.averaging from 15/- to 25/- a week.      The average of all civil service pensions is something ovor  100 a year, 4.     $here ia of course no legal obligation on the State to do more than they are doing for these various classes.      The prospect held out to each pensionable individual is that, on his retirement under certain conditions (including good behaviour), he should receive an allowance coloulatod according to certain clearly defined principles,     This prospect is fulfilled by the award of such an allowance and the matter ends.     This is pretty generally realised, and only half hearted attempts have been made to suggest that the State is under something more than a moral obligation to its pensioners,5c     There is, however, a.very prevalent misconception that the State in its pension&apos;schemes undertook to provide pensions of such amounts that the prospective recipients were guaranteed the means of existence corresponding to a certain minimum living standard which varied according to the class and station in life of the individual.      This conception is foreign to the whole principle of State pensions which are aaaoecod solely by reference to two factors (each of equal weight) viz, the salary when in active service   and the length cf that service.     She second of these factors has no bearing whatever on the margin of existence of the particular individual, whilst the important consideration? which would determine the subsistencepoint
point ?ize age, sex, family responsibilities, state of health, private means, &amp;c. are all absent.     The postman, for example, who retired after 1C years&apos; pensionable service for which he ho a been paid a salary of  80, got a pension of  10 a year which&quot;wao obviously insufficient in itself tenable him to live according to any standard of life,     Similarly., if &quot;adequate subsistence&quot; were aimed at, the young man retired through ill-health, and probably with a young family to bring up should have a bigger pension.; than the man retiring after reaching the age of 60, .Z&amp; ordinary good health and with his family expenses     ] behind him.     Yet the young unfit man gets a pension, reduced as compared with his older colleague,  in direct proportion to both his lower salary and his shorter period of service,     There is no ground, therefore, for the assumption that State pensions generally were intended to suffice for the individuals&apos; reasonable needs after retirement, without any personal contribution by them in the shape of either savings during active service,  or further work outside the Service in the case of the members of those branches of the public service (the fighting services and police in particular) who ordinarily retire when they are in the prime of life aneffit for many yaars1 further work.     The most that can be said is that the State pension represents a contribution to enable the pensioner, in recognition of his good service, to &quot;spend the years when he can no longer work in greater comfort and ease than would otherwise be the case, the contribution varying in amount according to the rank and length of service of the individual.
Ill6.     It may be arguec&quot;, however, that pensioners based their course of life on certain assumptions which have since been unexpectedly falaifiea as to tho purchasing&apos; power of t?.oir prospective pensions, and that had it been possible to foresee what was going to happen in the depreciation of the value of money, they would have made greater provision for their old age;   and that they are now ao heavily hit through no fault of their own that the State -should come to their rescue.     This plea would carry more weight if State pensionersstood alone in suffering through the inability to foresee the course of events,   but they do not;   they have Joined the ranks of a very large class who have been dubbed the &quot;new poor&quot;, beoauee their incomes have remained stationary while prices have more than doubled, How can the State pensioner be distinguished from the &apos;thousands of others in this category?     What difference is there between the State servant who had before the war earned in respect of a oertain number of years&apos; service an annuity for the rest ofhis life and, say the professional man who retired before tho war and purchased a Post Offloe annuity with the proceeds of sale of his practioe, or the private employoeAho, not being entitled to anj pension, had saved up sufficient, as he thought, to provide himeelf a reasonable competence for his old age and who new fiai? it totally inadequate for the purpose?    Ihose pc-otlo are all equally hard hit, [ but there in anotfw alase even worse off, comprising not the eltoly ptxypiti who have no longer the expense of bringir..;.: u- fr-imilies, but the younger people,such /
such as clergymen., with all the increasing expensesof keeping, clothing and educating their childrenon an income which even before the war was barelysufficient to keep body and soul together.As already stated the majority of Statepensioners consists of ex-soldiers, sailors andpolicemen who retire while they are in their full vigour on pensions which were never intended to enablethem to cease work.     These men ordinarily get other jobs, and as. they pet market wages in addition to their pensions their lot is happy compared with that of the olass just mentioned. 7,     The foregoing considerations lead to. the con-elusion that there is no reason why State pensioners should be singled out from the large mass of people hard hit by the war for specially favourable treatment, and when it is considered that an increase of their pensions could only be provided, by an increase in the burden of taxation to be borne by the rest of the community, including; it should be noted those who are already as hard hit as the nensioners themselves, it is difficult to find any justification for special treatment.     Indeed, If started in the case of pensioners can it stop there?     What.of the thousands of unestablished civil servants who have not the. benefit of any pension at all, and of the super- &apos; animated municipal officers and railway pensionerswho have an equal claim to consideration, which, if granted, would mean a further direct of indirect drain on the taxpayer?     Already, arising out of the con-tro^rsy as to State pensioners, a question has beenput down in the House of Commons suggesting that theState/
Stato should come to the aid of State, railway andothor pa nsloners ^id^oi^o cher people of small meansderived from f rienfl].yjscci e ties or sma 11 investments) -a suggestion which indicates the far-reaching effects which may result from &quot;any move in this direction.8.     If, however, it is felt that the relationship of the State to its ex-employees is closer than thatsubsisting between the State and others of its members who have suffered misfortune, and that thoState ought, notwithstanding its own unfortunatefinancial position, to vsome to the rescue of theformer oyen at the expense, in part, of the latter,the questions must be decided whether the whole bodyof pensioners or only a section of them are to be assisted and the extent of the help tc be given,(a) Any uniform percentage addition to pensions would produce groat anomalies for it would apply iegcrd-lo3S of the length of v/sorvice in respect of which the pension was given or of tho ago at which it was given, and also of the present age of the pensioner and his private circumstancese     An , addition of this nature which would affordappreciable relief to those in receipt of very small pensions would bo unduly generous; to those with large pensions and would of course oost a groat deal of money.(b) A scale of additions decreasing as the pension increases would not entirely remove these anomalies; in fact in some respects it&apos; would exaggerate them.(c) A possible alternative is to make compassionate grants to supplement pensions below a certain level.     Apart from the usual objections ta and the difficulty of maintaining a sharp line of demarcation, such a/system
system would operate most unfairly for it would, take no account of the private resources of the pensioner.     Even, if the level were taken as low as  1 a- week awkward comparisons with the old age pensioners might be dram.       If the latter have to wait till 70 and have to prove that their means are limited why should a State pensioner be given something (over and above what he could expect in respect of his service to the State) regardless of his age and his means?       If on the other hand (d) these grants are restricted to those in receipt of pensions below an assigned level who are in genuine distress,    it would be necesserj to utilise or create machinery for inquisition into private resources. Even then it would be impossible to escape from the awkward position that btate pensioners would be getting relief at an age below that v*hich the Government has decided to retain as the lowest age qualifying for an old age pension.
