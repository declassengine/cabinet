Tuapse is now in the hands of the enemy, possibly mutineers0The siiiation at Novorossisk on 1st March was such that, although somewhat less urgent, it is neoessary to continue the methodical evacuation.

A3 regards the R.A.E. section, they will be al!6wed to stay till the end of March; when only volunteers are to remain.Batoujn.*    One British and one Indian battalion remain for the presento   At request of foreign Office, the Admiralty have agreed that two British warships will be kept there as far as practicable. The question of the future garrisea has been referred to the [French and Italian War Offioes, and an early reply is being pressed for.Refugees.0-in-C8 states that decision with regard to refugees, compromised civilians and personnel cf Volunteer Army is virtual abandonment of volunteer movement to its fate.Greek Government are averse to facilitating passage through Salonica cf refugees to SerbiaaBulgaria states that the number of 8.000 agreed to has been exceeded and that it is quite impossible &quot;go receive any more.Colonial Offioe has consented to receive 1,000 at Cyprus when Turkish prisoners are repatriated.    Egy$t declares that it is very undesirable that any more should be sent there.Aegean.*&quot;  cDublin&quot; will be stationed at Mudros as W/T link and will also act as depot ship for harbour craft attached to Marine . Garrison, Aegean Islands.Danube...   .   - Temporary Inter-All led Danube Commission is shortly tomake a tour of inspection.

March for Alexandria and Malta en route to England;EAST INDIES.Operations in Soraaliland having been brought to a successful conclusion &quot;Odin&quot; proceeds shortly on a cruise to East African Coast, visiting Mauritius, Seychelles, and then to Colombo,&quot;Clio&quot; leaves Aden 11th March for Persian Gulf.&quot;Espiegle&quot; will proceed to Aden on completion of her refit at Gibraltar about 18th M*rch.TURKEY,The situation between      -Turks and,the Alliesbecomes daily more strained and the influences making for resistance to the Peace Terms are mere than ever in the ascendant.It, is the considered opinion of Admiral de Robeck that a peace wMoh gives Smyrna and Thrace to the Greeks must be imposed by arms;   the Sultan and other anti-Nationalist elements can onlybe
be enlisted on the oi.de of the Allies in support of lenient terms &apos;such as purely Turkish sovereignty over Smyrna end E, Thrace and suzerainty over a substantial portion of the E0 Province of Asia Minor.The High Commissioner, Constantinople, is of opinion that in deciding on the course of action to be prusued in relation to the present situation in Tiirkey the Allies should not be guided by the recent happenings in Cilicia, since it is hard to say whether the French or the Turks are the most responsible for letting the situation there drift into massacre.    No action now taken at Constantinople will retrieve the situation in Cilicia, and; it is necessary to adjust action to the wider issues raised by the Nationalist determination to resist the drastic Peace which the Supreme Council intends to impose,Allied naval demonstrations on the Cilician coast would be useless, and in any case Naval action in those waters should be left to the French alone to undertake.Ihile consulting in the above matters   &apos;-- with his French colleague, Admiral de Robeck feels a difficulty in similarly taking the Italian High Commissioner into his confidence, since therms much evidence that Italian policy at Constantinople is strongly pro &quot;Turk,&quot;&apos;&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;*&quot;&apos;    The question of restricting commercial intercourse between Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey has again engaged the atten-tion of the Conference of Ambassadors.     proposals were considered limited to preventing German ships from visiting Turkish ports, as a political precaution against the entry of German, influence and propaganda, but putting no obstacle in the way of the import of German goods into Turkey in neutral or allied bottoms, since the Separations Commission has advised against any restriction on n German export trade.^ren in this form there is some question as to the legality of such restrictions in view of Germany being no longer an enemy country and a system of licences is considered impracticablesThe whole matter has once more been referred to the High Comaiis si oners at Constantinople and their views requested.GERMANY.The Conference of Ambassadors decided on the 25th February in accordance with the recommendation of the Naval jbqperts, to Instruct,  the Naval Commission of Control in Germany to proceed forthwith with the destruction in Germany of all surplus naval equipment specified in Article 192 withthe exception of that belonging to Light Cruisers and Destroyers provided for in the Protocol of 10 January.     Complete equipment necessary for these Light Cruisers and Destroyers is to remain in store under the supervision of the&apos; Commission of Control^ and it was agreed that should it subsequently be found that the German Government hail infringed      the terms of the Treaty or Protocol, so far as the surrender of the ships o  their equipment is concerned, the Con-ference of Ambassadors should decide whether compensation might not be obtained by the Allied Powers taking possession of some or all of this equipment for their own U3e Instead of destroying it under the terms cf the Treaty.The delivery of German men-of-war to the Allies will probably comnance about the middle of March.AUSTRIA.Rear-Admiral Kiddle, Senior British Member of the Inter-Allied Naval Commission of Control for Austria and Hungary will probably be relieved by Rear-Admiral H.D.R. Watson.
There is talk of doing away with tho port Demands of Cher-bourg and Lorient, and already Vice-Admiral Aubry has gone from &apos; Lbrient to Brest without being relieved.    The usaour is that tho Haval Dockyard at Lorient will be turned over to tho great firm of Schneider&apos;j The French Mediterranean Fleet no longer exists as such.   1% has been replaced by two Squadrons each commanded by a vice-Adudral and completely independent of each other in peace time.The First, or Eastern Mediterranean Squadron consists of the battleshipBLorr6ulneJ,e temporarily flying the flag of the C in C., Vice Admiral do Bon;   tho throe most modem armoured cruisers ]   tho present Syrian Division; two destroyer flotillase comprising the twelve destroyors built in Japan during the war; a division of 6 doapatch vessels; and a division of 6 sunboats. he Second, or Western Mediterranean Squadron consists of the 6 remaining Dreadnoughts (three with special complements end thres in commissioned reserve) to which the ^Lorraine&quot; will be added later, end one destroyer flojbilla of 6 fairly modem destroyers.There will be, in addition, a flotilla of 6 destroyers at Toulon, manned with half crews, for filling up vacancies.She proposed  method of division amongst the Allies cf the Enemy &amp;s Merchant Fleet is hotly resented in France.    The rumour that Frande will be reqtrLred to give back 200,000 tons of shipping out of the 585,000 provisionally assigned to French management has caused a general outcry in the press.     The same argument which has constantly &quot;been used in discussing the division of the German fleet, both Naval and Mercantile, is again brought forward, viz. that, while other nations wer$ able to replace their lose 38, the French effort was concentrated on the supply of munitions for themselves and their allies.The various Federations of Officers cf the Mercantile Marine have bound themselves to resist, by all means in their power, the restitution of the 200,000 tons in question.MIS CHILAliaOUS HOME INXELJQIGENCE,E.M,S. &quot;JO^uTJ,&quot; has been purchased by the Portuguese Govern-mento     She was commissioned as a Portuguese man-of-war at Devonpcrt cn Thursday 4th March.Ounard SvSB&apos; CO. and Hamburg.-   ; It is understood that the s,s. &quot;SaxoniaB of the Cunarl Line will include - Hamburg as a port of call on her next trip from New York, and that the port will become a regular part of- the eastern itinerary of their Steamers.     The Company Is believed to be negotiating for Xax^go docking space and sheds at Hamburg, together with an hotel formerly owned by the Hamburg America Line, and evidently intends to compete for the traffic (formerly German) between Central Europe and the United States.American Line Steamers and Plymouth.-    The&apos; s.s. BNew York&quot; of the American Line called at Plymouth &quot;on Saturday 28th -;-February, for the first time since the outbreak of mr.   . The pre-war itinerary, viz. New York, Plymouth,.,-Cherbourg and Southampton has therefore been resumed.ADMIRALTY,10th March 1920.
