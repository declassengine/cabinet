[this document is the hupeify of his britannic majesty s government.) 335EGYPT AND SOUDAN. /^Q^------[March 17.]CONFIDENTIAL.[e 1385/909/16] No. 1.Further Memorandum respecting the Egyptian Cotton Control Scheme.AT their meeting on the 4th March the Cabinet decided to request the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade to furnish them with further particulars as to the exact nature of the agreement between the two Governments and as to who at present actually holds the surplus.The question was also raised as to whether the Egyptian Government would accept a compromise, under which His Majesty&apos;s Government would guarantee to devote their share of the profits to the development of the Egyptian cotton industry, both in Egypt and in England.As regards the nature of the agreement between the two Governments, our knowledge on this subject is confined to the Board of Trade memorandum submitted to the Foreign Office with their letter of the 25th March, 1918.   This memorandum was 55221/18. written by Sir H. Llewellyn Smith, and the following passages are relevant and show the nature of the agreement arrived at between him and the Egyptian Government : Page 5. &quot; It should be noted in passing that, although the general outlines of the scheme were discussed with the Egyptian Prime Minister and were subsequently explained by Sir William Brunyate to the Council of Ministers, the matter in which they were mostly interested was the purchase price and its relation to the selling price, both in Alexandria and Lancashire.&quot;Page 7. --&quot; It was necessary to fix a price which was satistacfory to the Egyptian Government, especially in view of the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment also stipulated that the Egyptian Government should join them in guaranteeing the scheme.&quot;Page 8. &quot; Pursuant to their desire that the price paid to the grower should, if possible, be maintained throughout the season, the Egyptian Government conveyed to us through Sir William Brunyate the suggestion that, if His Majestys Government should find it necessary to increase the selling price owing to the abnormal conditions, they would probably prefer that the purchase price should nevertheless be maintained unchanged, and that the additional profit resulting from the increased price should not go into the growers&apos; pockets but should accrue to the Egyptian Treasury. The object of this proposal was to tap the excess profits of the growers for war taxation. We do not think it necessary to object to this stipulation, which seemed to us to be an internal matter for Egypt to decide, provided any advance of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the capital necessary for carrying out the scheme was effectively protected (an object which appeared to be secure so long as there was a margin of at least 6 dollars between the purchase and selling price.of standard cotton), and provided any decision as to an increase in selling prices rested with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The latter condition was accepted by Sir William Brunyate.&quot;Pages 10 and 11.-&quot; As regards any surplus profits remaining after paying all expenses and the interest on the advances made by the banks and the Treasury, we suggested that such surplus should be allocated for a scheme for improving and developing cotton growing in Egypt. By a telegram of the 3rd March from the 40284/18. Foreign Office it was intimated to us that it was desired that no definite announce-ment should be issued devoting the surplus profit in its entirety to Egyptian purposes, and by a telegram of the 7th March we were informed that the Treasury 42947/18. were not prepared to guarantee the-whole 20,000,0001, including the amount of the advance in Egypt, unless the Egyptian Government would indemnify the Treasury against any loss on the latter, and they suggested that the Egyptian Government should guarantee 10,000,OOOL, the other 10,000,00(U. being found by the Treasury. This latter stipulation put us in some difficulty as the scheme had hitherto been envisaged by Sir William Brunyate as one tvholly or mainly in the interest of the United Kingdom and allied users of Egyptian cotton, but eventually by representing the cotton scheme as part of a general scheme for conserving the[2535 r-1]
material resources from which Egypt had much to gain in other ways (e. g., in regard to her supplies of coal and shipping during the reconstruction period i he was able to secure the approval of the Egyptian Ministers to the proposal to associate the Egyptian Government with the guaranteeing of the scheme. The W proposal to allocate even a proportion of any profit to any particular purpose was at the same time abandoned. The effect of, the arrangement, therefore, is that should there be any eventual loss&apos; (a contingency which is highly improbable), it would be shared equally between the two Governments, whilst any eventual surplus will be disposed of ultimately by an agreement between them.&quot;55221/18. With the Board of Trade letter of the 25th March, 1918, there were transmittedcopies of letters exchanged between the Board of Trade and the Treasury definitely concluding the agreement. The relevant passages as regards division of profits in the Board of Trade&apos;s letter are as follows : &quot; Clause 5. For the financing of the scheme the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury are to furnish 10,000,000 sterling and the National Bank of Egypt 10,000,000 sterling, the latter loan with its interest being guaranteed by the Egyptian Government.&quot;&quot;Clause 8. If a profit should be made over and above 5^ per cent, on the sum advanced by their Lordships, some portion of this is to be devoted to improving and to the development of cotton cultivation in Egypt.&quot;55221/18. The Treasury in their reply thereto of the 23rd March, 1918, agreed to the general terms of the agreement, subject to the following modifications : &quot; Clause 8. The consent of their Lordships to forgo for the purpose mentioned a portion of any profit which may accrue from the transaction, after provision for interest on the Exchequer advance has been made, is conditional on the Egyptian Government acting likewise.&quot;The preceding passages show that the agreement, though it did not take the form of a written contract between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government, was at least fairly definite.   There is nothing to show that the Board of Trade55221/18.    Memorandum, transmitted to the Foreign Office with their letter of the 25th March.1918, had at that time been communicated to the Treasury, and this may perhaps account for the fact that the Treasury were unaware before 1919 that the agreement implied subsequent negotiation as to the division of profits.55221/18. But Clause 8 in the Board of Trade letter of the 16th March to the Treasury,stating that a portion of the profits, after the Treasury advances and the interest thereon had been made, was to be devoted to furthering cotton cultivation in Egypt, seems to imply that the rest of the profits should go to the Egyptian Government, and there is no suggestion that the portion devoted to furthering cotton cultivation should be55221/18. expended outside of Egypt. It is true that the Treasury in their letter of the 23rd March only gave qualified approval of clause 8, but as in point of fact the Treasury were not called on to advance one penny, there appears on these grounds to be some justification for the Egyptian Governments view that they are entitled to all the profits.As regards the whereabouts of the actual money which, when a few outstanding accounts are settled and certain receipts come in for cotton sold in England, amounts to about c E. 3,600,000 approximately; this sum is now on deposit, with interest, in the Anglo-Egyptian Bank - and the National Bank of Egypt in that country. The Chairman of the Committee can withdraw it by cheque, and this gentleman is an official of the Egyptian Ministry of Finance.As regards the question of a possible compromise on the distribution of profits, the Egyptian Government are prepared to earmark for cotton research and cotton development a very considerable proportion of the whole sum, but they insist that the direction of the expenditure of this money should remain in their hands and be devoted to developing the Egyptian cotton industry in Egypt. With this view I feel bound to concur, for were any Imperial institute to be set up in Egypt for the furtherance of cotton research the impression would inevitably be caused that the protecting Power was running Egypt in the interests of Lancashire, and it is unnecessary to lav stress on the deplorable political results which such an impression would certainly produce.Foreign Office, March 17, 1920.C. of K.
