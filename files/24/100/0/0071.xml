ARAPHRASE telegram the Secretary of State for the Colonies to  the governors General of the Commonwealth of Australia New Zealand and the Union of South Africa,13th March-   Secret.,  My despatch of 12th January Secret,   United States Senate Reservations to Treaty, The Canadian Government have nude further representation as to combined effect of first part of Lenroot reservation and resolving clause (i,e.) preamble.Latest version of first part of Lenroot reservation is as follows-   Begins.  Until Covenant League of,Nations so amended as to provide that United States shall be entitled to cast number of votes equal to that which any member of League and its self-governing Dominiens. Colonies, or parts of Empire in aggregate shall be entitled to cast United States assumes no obligation to be bound except in cases where Congress has previously given this consent by any decision etc. of Council or assembly in which any member of League and its self-governing Dominions, Colonies or parts of Empire in aggregate have cast more than one vote,, Ends,Resolving olause in amended form requires acceptance by Allied and Associated Powers of ell reservations adopted by Senate and states that failure on part of such powers to object to reservations prior to deposit of ratification by United States will be taken as acceptance.The Canadian Government point out that first part of the Lenroot Reservation whether in its original or modified form cannot be read as ether than a diBemt(Sent 4,10 p*m. 13th March 1920)challenge
challenge of status of the Dominions in the League of Nations and the denial of their right to vote.    They do not understand on what ground united Status could bo given additional votes in Assembly without changing whole basis of representation and voting.    If population is chosen then proportionate voting strength of British JBmpire in League would be more than double what it is at present and the voting strength of United Status would be reduced corres-pendtngly.    If United States is entitled to additional votes then other Powers are equally entitled and voting ceases to be on the basis of membership in the League and some other rale equally applicable to all Nations must be adopted.Canadian Government state that they are opposed unalterably to any assent, either by positive declaration or by silence which could be deemed acquiescence to first part of Ltnroot reservation and that if any reservation is finally adopted by United States as part of its ratification which challenges the &quot;position or status of Canada in the League Canada will dissent therefrom and a protest against its acceptance will be filed and they will reserve full freedom of action under such conditions.Canadian Government are advised that whichever form of resolving clause adopted it would be necessary to . have assent of His Majesty on behalf of ail member nations of British Empire and that dissent of His Majesty on behalf of any one of these members would prevent both resolving clause from taking effect and also ratification by the United States.    Canadian Government enquire whether His Majesty&apos;s Government share this view.Canadian
Canadian Government have asked also that it should be made perfectly clear to tho United States Government that no suoh Reservation either in its original or modi-fied form as is contained in first portion of Lenroot reservation could be acoeded to by the British Empire.Reply was sent to the Canadian Government 8th March as follows.   Begins.  His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that Lenroot reservation involves departure from agreement arrived at in Paris and entirely accept the view that dissent of any Dominions Government will prevent Empire from accepting reservation.   So far no official representations with regard to reservation made to United States Government but in view of representations of Canadian Government and objection of Australia and South Africa (see my Secret despatch 12th January) to second part of Reservation His Majesty&apos;3 Government quite prepared to make clear to Government of United States that we cannot accept reservation if and when it and resolving clause are actually adopted and before ratification as contemplated in latter.   Fate of reservation and of whole Treaty apparently still doubtful and it is worth consideration whether any public declara-tion now would not be used to consolidate American opinion in support of policy expressed in reservation.His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to have opinionof Canadian Government on this point as if they are dis-posed to agree it would seem wiser to see whether reserva-tion is finally adopted and if so in what form before maltingpublic announcement as to our position.   Ends.   No replyhas yet been received from the Canadian Government.   Willkeep your Ministers informed as to developments.As His Majesty&apos;s Government may have to take action asindicated in above telegram to Canada at very short notice should be glad to have their observations as quickly as possible.
