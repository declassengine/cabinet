(Memorandum ,hy the Mini star of Pensions)I call attention to the -varying steps now being taken by different units ..of the Empire for dealing-with the effect on.their currencies of, the divergence in values between gold and. sterlingsIflfllA has east off the Pound sterling and fibred its rupee in relation to gold leaving its rupee of the same fineness as formerly,EAST AffRICA . is reducing the silver in its rupee to a fine-ness of 450, but is fixing its token value in relation to the Pound sterling/SOUTH APEIOA is nominally on a sterling basis, using a gold ti eve reign worth, say 28/-, to represent a Pound sterling;   nevertheless , remittances, to&apos; this country at. sight are subject to a discount of       to. &amp;fo which in effect puts the South African currency at a premium in London,      There must be a great risk that this &quot;premium will rise perhaps to:the gold point. If I understand the position rightly, India is nowlinked for exchange purposes to the American dollar;   it. is*a bad for the Pound sterling for England to buy in India asto buy in America and South Africa may be forced to becomesimilarly linked..It seems to me that, the whole Empire&apos; should support the pound sterling;   it is to the ultimate interest ,of all toprevent breaks away in currency which-are likely to change thetrade channels..   An Empire currency is needed.I suggest that immediate steps should be taken to review the whole position, and that the Finance Ministers of the.^jnpire should.be asked to send representatives to a very..early conference *  ,1* I:&apos; &apos;.
