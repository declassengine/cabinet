S DOCtlMT 13 THff PROPERTY OF HIS BRITM^IC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVlR^OTT) .MILITARY AIVS 0? THE IRISH &quot;VOLUNTEERS;., Note by thChief Secretary for Ireland.I circulate, for the information of Members of the Cabinet, extracts taken from a communication seized by the police on the 2nd instant, and which has reached my hands to-day.   It illus-trates the military aims of the Irish Volunteers, to which I referred in my speech in the House last Thursday.i C H i7&quot; T.t   821.Copy No.A B I N E T;(Intld.)    I.Ksh office, 8th larch, 192q.
SECRET &amp; CONFIDWTIAL.Talcing the country a3 a whole, we know that our present enemy depends a great deal for communication on Police &quot;barracks which from our point of view merely become isolated military posts.   There are very few R.I.C. Barracks which the local Volunteers could not destroy in a very short time, assuming of course that they are determined and able men.   By simultaneous action all over the country the enemy communication could be broken and a chance given (which should be taken) of concen-trating larger bodies of Volunteers on the Garrison towns with a view to at least holding the military in these towns.   I would go so far as to state that if our force as at present armed and trained took the initiative, of course simultaneously all over the country, 75$ of this country would fall into our hands with the exception of the cities and large towns and military camps.   The latter when not in communication with their Head Quarters would have to act independently, being cut off and a better chance is given our force to defeating them than if their communications, supplies, etc., were free.We all know we could not hope to hold the above 75$ for any length of time, but by acting on the active defensive we can get the best military results possible.As regards the offensive.   For one force to take the offensive would be suicide.We now come to the tactics likely to be employed in carrying out our offensive strategy, and we find that the first thing to be done is to   amash enemy&apos; communications. These we can place under the heads of -MILITARY POSTS, R.I.C. BARRACKS, POST OFFICES.Every officer should make himself familiar with these three in his District and think out beforehand how he could attack and destroy same if held by the enemy.   It strikes me that grenades will play a very important part in determining whether the enemy communications are broken or not.   As a general rule I think it would be possible to rush most R.I.C, Barracks and Military Posts at night and capture same by the use of hand grenades only.Special Note :-   All our training, lectures ,etc, drive us to one conclusion, namely, that no matter what strategy we may adopt we will evidently be beaten, in a military sense,.and I think it will be agreed, under the circumstances that the offensive Defensive Strategy would be the best one for ue to adopt.
