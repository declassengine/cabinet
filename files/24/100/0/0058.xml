THIS DOCUMMTT IS THE PRQP3BRTV OF HIS BRIT ANTIC MAJESTY&apos; SSEC R E copy No.CP. 858.C A B I N E T ,THE GRAVITY OF 33 PER.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Beard of  duoaticn.The decision recently taken by the Cabinet to leave the future arrangements as to the gravity of the beer to be settled either by the Budget or by the Licensing Bill, whichever cernes first, has led me to give further consideration to the question.   The xJhan-cellcr of the Exchequer desires to remove the present disparity between the English and Irish Stout Trade and I agree with him in thinking that it is difficult to defend.   There are, however, three points which 1 wish to put before the cabinet 1st.-     The importance of the alleged grievance has been greatly exaggerated.   I understand that before the Y/ar Irish gravity was on a substantially higher scale than English, and further that the English brewer has a market for beer of pretty low gravity by means of which he can reduce his general brewing average whereas the Irish brewer has only his porter, which cannot be successfully brewed at a gravity -so low as that of the beers which can be sold in England. The grievance is, therefore, not so great in substance as it can be made to appear on paper. 2nd, -   In the interests of Temperance I attach great importance to keeping the gravity of the- bulk of the beor sold at, approximately, its present level and for this object I would be prepared to face much criticism an matters of detail, in this matter I am voicing the opinion of a good number of intelligent brewers in this Country.   Let me quote sn extract from a letter which I have just received from Mr. Calder, the Managing Director of Samuel Allsopp &amp; Sons,. Ltd.:-
&quot;I hold the view very strongly that nothing is i;ore conducive to sobriety than the reduction in the strength of spirits brought about by the Control Board, and also lighter beers which have been sold during the War, and I am sure it would be a very retrograde policy and bad for the country - oven more so fa? the brewers - if the old state of things wore allowed to come back.This is my own personal view, but it is shared by a great many brewers who see that the present light beers are giving great satisfaction and would like to see the present good position, in regard to sobriety continue,&quot; Mr. calder, it is true, goes on to suggest that a different average might be taken for black beers and stout, but my advisers do not think that this would be possible. 3rd. -   I am satisfied that if the average gravity has to be advanced to lo51 in order to remove the disparity between Ireland and England and to satisfy the very restricted grievance of the London stout Brewers, it is useless to attempt to control average gravity at all and that the Clause giving to the Liquor Corn-mission power to control gravity over a certain figure should be withdrawn.   I should regard this as most undesirable.(Intld.)   H.F, -Board of Education. 13th March, 192Q.
