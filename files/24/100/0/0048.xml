In ho ftnilAVERAGE GRAVITY OF BEER^ rO 0 CT Memorandum by the Ministry, of Food^- IV&quot; I think it my duty to warn the Cabinet that.unless they are prepared IJo modify in some degree their decision of the 4th instant, that&quot;The question of restrictions on the average gravity of beer should be dealt:with either in the Intoxicating   Liquor (Regulation) Bill or at the time of the Budget Statement&quot;, I serious waste of foodstuffs, mainly cereals, will ensue.2S   I understand the position to be this:. Certain brewers of high gravity Ibeers must, in order to bring themselves within the four corners of the In-toxicating Liquor (Output &amp; delivery). Order,: brew before the. end of the month a very large quantity of beer at the lowest possible gravity, namelyy-10100^ so as to adjust their average to the permitted individual average gravity of 10440 for the whole quarter.5c This difficulty has arisen because put of beer has-been abolished the, system ihlch one brewer transferred barrelage to adjusting the average gravity) broke downsince the restriction on the out-of transfer certificates (by another brewer for the purpose of and had to be abolished. It was for this: among other, reasons that the late Food Controller recommended the abolition of all restrictions on average gravity *4.   Unless the Cabinet will sanction some way out of the difficulty which has arisen, a brewer like Messrso Bass will have before the end of the present quarter to brew no less than 66,000 barrels of beer at 10100* For this beer no sale can be found (there being no demand for any beer under an average gravity of 10270). It v/ould appear, then that this beer will lit-erally have to be wasted. Colonel Gretton, Chairman of Messrs. Bass, has, I Relieve, already put this position before the Prime Minister,   ,5,   As the Cabinet are not prepared to sanction the total/abolition of allvrestrictions on the. average gravity of beer, I can only suggest two possible, alternative methods of dealing&apos;with this matter.Alternative 1.Alternative 2.To give each brewer the option of brewing up to within 15%. of his individual pre-war gravity. Such an option would meet; the case of those brewers who are now com-plaining, with justice, of individual hardship; it would affect to a very small extent the average gravity of the ,country as.a whole; and it would leave the g&amp;neral prin-clple of control intact.To adopt a system of pooling. Under this system a brewer &apos;,     &apos; of high gravity beer and a brewer of low gravity beer . would pool their gravity in accordance with a licence tobe, issued by the Food Controller-, The result would be ;  that the.-,average gravity of the two brewers would not exceed in the aggregate 10440,.the maximum gravity per4 mitted under the existing Order.Under each of these alternatives, the&apos;principle of control is retained, nd the position in regard to,the Intoxicating Liquor (Regulation) Bill ould not be prejudiced. Moreover&apos; the sanction of either alternative will ot, in fact,/the brewing of, any stronger beer, result in ,   It will be clear from what has been said that a decision in this atter is very urgently needed, and should be given within the next day or wo at the latest. &quot;&apos;Ministry of Food,12th March, l$20iCHARLES A.
