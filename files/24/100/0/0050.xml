General Denikin, however, refused to give an answer without reference to bis staff, but promised to reply as early as possible. I accompanied General Holman to Ekaterinodar arriving a eiu * on Sunday 25th January *5c I had intended to leave Ekaterinodar p*nio 25th but no reply had been received from General Denikin, and in view of a meeting of the Kuban and Don Atamans with General Denikin which was taking place that day General Holman desired me to remain until Monday 26th January, and then, to return to Novorossisk with himo4o The following message was received from General Denikinat 1600 L.T. on 26th January and we left at 1700 L*T* for llovorossisk&quot;00326/26th Januaryo Position regarding Petrovsk secure a   Negotiations are being carried on regarding possibility of carrying out repairs.at Baku.

(A) about noon on 27th January.6. MILITARY SITUATION.     The situation of the Don Manitchfront is, on the whole&apos;s&quot;easTer9   The defeat of Budennie*s cavalry on 19th January has improved the morale of the Volunteer (1st) Corps9 and had a serious effect on the morale of the enemy forces * In addition to the los; es inflicted on him during the battle Budonnie also lost a number of men owing to the ice breaking whilst they were endeavouring to recross the Dono   To replace his casualties Budennie is mounting his transport drivers, and re-cruiting any civilians who will join him.   A number of his Cossacks are deserting to their stannltzas.Further East the Don Army is fighting better, but Pokrovskyvs army is losing morale oving to their long retreat and many desertions.This army did&apos; not reach the Manitch River without some pressure, and the Bolsheviks were delivering strong attacks at Elmut when the unexpected arrival of a division of Pokrovsky&apos;s army who had been loft &quot;in the air&quot; near Remontnaya changed the situation and the Bolsheviks drew off aSome enemy trocps succeeded in crossing the Manitch at Manichskaya but were eventually driven backs -The Bolshevik concentrations on this front are as follows :- VIIIth  Armyj Budennie1s cavalryj DmnenkoJs Cavalryj
IXth Armyj and Xth Army.Of the A.F.S.R. there is no doubt that the Volunteer (1st Corps) are the backbone of the whole of this front, and that they are the only reliable troopse      Sir Halford Mackinder&apos;s pronouncement and the rumours that the British have occupied Novorossisk have had a stiffening effect,   and BENBOW;S action with the Green Guard will no doubt still further improvg(jthe morale of the A.F.S.R-.It must/be expected that the Bolsheviks will endeavour to pierce Pokrovskyrs line on the Manitch, and penetrate through to Tildieretzka thus clearing the line for their operations in the North Caucasus.The North Caucasian front is looked upon by Denikin&apos;s staff as perfectly safe.     The Potrovsk - Tikhoretza railway is still running, but very little oil is being obtained from Grozni.A Bolshevik surprise attack on Sviata Kresta was temporarily successful, but the enemy have since been driven out.     There is still, however, an undoubted threat to the Mineral Water District and this has had the effect of increasing the number of refugees arriving in Novorossisk. Some of these are coming up from Tuapse.On the coast after recapturing Eisliar General Erdeii is continuing his advance towards Cherni Rinok.A Russian Intelligence report dated 26th January states that General Denikin5s forces still occupy Krasnovodsk.7&quot;&quot;   POLITICAL SITUATION.      Everything may be said to depend on the Political situation which is now extremely delicateo    At a meeting of the Kuban, Don and Terek Radas at Ekaterinodar speeches were made which showed that whilst the general tendency of the Cossack peoples was whole-heartedly anti-Bolshevik they were &quot;fed up&quot; with the inefficient control of Denikinfs generals.   While prepared to accept some form, of efficient autocracy they were determined no longer to put up with the old, reactionary, and inefficient Generals whom Denikin put over them as Governors of Towns and Provinces.      Two of their principal &quot;betes noirs&quot; were Lukcmsky (late President of the Council and now Governor at Novorossisk) and Romanovski (Chief of Denikin&apos;s Staff).After the debacle of the Volunteer Army Denikin dissolved the Special Council and eventually selected the Don Ataman Bogaevski as the President of the New Government. Although this was some slight concossion to the wishes of the Cossacks it was considered that he had not gone far enough and after a meeting of the Rada (referred to above) it was decided that Bukretov (the newly elected Kuban Ataman) and Bogaievski should visit Denikin and lay the following proiect before him.Bukretov&apos;s speeches to the Cossacks showed him to be firmly loyal to, and a whole-hearted supporter of Denikin in whom he stated he had complete confidence.    He also affirmed his loyalty to Bogaevski.PROJECT OF CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE OF DON KUBAN &amp; TEREK.WE, the elected members of the Don, Kuban and Terek Krugs at this important moment when our freedom -bought with our blood - and the very liberty of the people is threatened have met in Ekaterinodar to organise a struggle against the Bolsheviks and to clear them from our territory.      In order to defend our hearths and homes and to establish tranquillity and to safeguard our freedom and our rights we take into our own hands the Government of the Don, Kuban, and Terok and lay down the following rules for the Supreme Government.
1. The Supreme Government has full powers to formthe necessary organs for-the Government of the Don, Kuban andTerek, and its tasks are :-A* To establish an Allied State in the above-mentioned territority with power to increase its boundaries by including new provinces on the basis of similar.constitutions, and by the free choice of the People of such Provinces.B. The creation of an Allied Authority. 2. The Allied Constitution andvPower will be formedpending the establishment of the ^11-Russia National Assembly 3., This Constitution, which is now being worked out,will come into force from the moment of its acceptance by the Supreme &amp;rug.The two Atamans submitted this point to. General Denikin at Tlkhoretzka on Sunday 25th i&amp;amspx$ January, but they v/ere not allowed to see General Denikin by himself General Romanovski being always present.      His presence restricted the conversation and the Ataman3 considered the interview unsatisfactory^ General Denikin apparently insisted on maintaining his An, Russia policy, and on the necessity for a sort of Military Dictatorship, and gave the Atamans a time-limit to reconsider their project and to accept his proposals *   If they then still refused to support them he would withdraw to the Crimea with all his forceseGeneral ^olman proposes to see Denikin again on Thursday 29th January, and will try to persuade him to give way.   At the same time General Keyes will interview the Atamans and representatives of the Radad at Ekaterinodar and will try to keep them in a conciliatory mood.General Holman1s task has, however, been made consider-ably harder b$ the receipt of, a W/T message at Ekaterinodar stating that the Allies had removed the blockade of Soviet Russia and had re-established postal facilities, and that an Allied, co-operative Mission was proceeding to Moscow.This message was a severe blow to both Generals Holman and Keycs as it was opposed to the instructions given to these Officers when they &quot;left England, and directly contrary to statements in the House of Commons about two months ago that the Allies would have no dealings with the Soviet Government.x x x x, x x x x x x x x x x xUnless H.M. Government issue immediate denial General Holman thinks it may be Impossible to save the situation.   The Cossacks will begin to treat with the Bolsheviks.who have recently offered them very, tempting terms to.cease fighting. Under these circumstances it is doubtful whether Denikin would be allowed to withdraw to the Crimea.   If this course proved impossible it is to be feared that he might shoot himself, and without a leader the remains of the Volunteer Army would be at the mercy of the Red Army whose leaders have announced that they are irreconcilable towards Denikin&apos;s and Kolchak1s armies, and that they will admit of no peace, truce, ofr understanding with them.If/
If, on the othei^iand, Denikin can he persuaded to grant a Constitution as proposed &quot;by the Rada, andit is found that Great Britah does not intend to withdraw her support from Denikin and transfer it-to the Soviet Government,, there is little doubt that the Cossacks will rise against the Bolsheviks and with Denikin as their Commander in Chief they should have little difficulty in keeping the enemy clear of their territory.It is also hoped that the Crimea and Odessa will be held, and with the Kuban will form admirable training grounds for the re-organisation and re-formation of the A.F.S.R. as well as suitable fields for the application of Sir H. Mackinder&quot;s policy.8.-     EXAMINATION Off CAPTURED OFFICER.An ex-Captain of the Russian General Staff recently came down in a Bolshevik aeroplane behind the A.F.S.R. lines, He proved to be the Chief of the Bolshevik Air Service, called himself Richter, but real name Strolev.    Attempted to bum, his machine on discovering he wa3 in enemy territory.       In possession of several papers giving him extensive powers in the Red Army, travelling facilities etc.,&apos; but no documents of interest.      The Russian Staff has not yet decided whether his information is trustworthy or whether he has been deliberately sent over by the enemy.The following summary of that part of his examination dealing with the intentions and objectives of the Red Army was telegraphed to the War Office and Secretary of State for War:-MRed Armies operating against Denikin were ordered to occupy Donetz coal area, Grozni and Baku oilfields, and capture Novocherkask and Rostov which Bolsheviks regard as centres of counter-Revolution.     Objectives were to be obtained by defeating the Volunteer Army whilst dcmon3-trating against the Don.     Budennie!s cavalry ^group was ordered to separate the Volunteer from the Don Army and pursue the former which it was thought would endeavour to retire Westwards.     But on 2nd January orders were changed partly due to withdrawal of portion of Volunteer Army to S&apos;.S, Jwards,    (xIOTS.     Thi3 was deliberately ordered by Denikin and though it entailed heavy losses enabled him to keep touch with Cossacks who might otherwise have accused him of deserting them).        But change of orders was mainly due to insistence of Budennie&apos;s staff that he should enter Jon and Kuban territory to satisfy his men many of whom are Red Cossacks from Don and Kuban Stannitzas.Immediate occupation of Crimea, Odessa, and Eastern shores of Black and Azov seas not considered essential by the Bolsheviks but they consider it essential to annihilate the Volunteer Army:     to defeat it is not   sufficient.In order to do this, to reach warmer or wheaf-bearing lands, to get oil, and to disallay dissatisfaction caused by paucity of loot and prisoners so far gained as compared with results in Turkestan and against Kolchak they intend to undertake extensive operations in North Caucasus and satisfy the desire of Budennie&apos;s men to visit their homes.
They consider the Eastern front has been dealt with and that danger of active interference by Japan as a result of their present successes is adequately guarded against by the enormous distances involved,   . They are anxious about the Western front as they regard the polish Army as formidable.     Nevertheless it is not expected they will reinforce this front because the idea of pushing a plan to completion is now thoroughly understood by Civil and Military Authorities.       They have learned not to fear mere loss of territory especially when it is poor in food re sourceSoGreat faith is placed in cavalry masses which are given very definite objectives,     Mamontov&apos;s raid gave a great impetus to formation of cavalry units.Am refraining from reference to political matters now that political Mission is here but desire to state that present is very critical stage in struggle and that any recognition or encouragement of Bolsheviks by us would have disastrous results on Cossacks who are wavering.     If given Democratic Constitution by Denikin they will fight Bolsheviks to last man but in present state they are very susceptible to outside influence.     IHNMISS&quot;.9.- The following further account of Rienter1sexamina-tion is compiled from brief notes taken during a discussion of his statements,A.   Pormation of Special Units.       In October 1919 special Communist units were formed on the scale of one special battalion per regiment per district.     Their duties included the putting down of risings, protection of Government institutions (including the Extraordinary Commissions).   The staff controllin these special units is at Moscow, and consists entirely of Soviet workmen.     Partisan detachments were also formed at- this time and left with sealed orders in November.     It is supposed that these are proceeding to Korea, China, Afghanistan   etc.B*   Mobilisation.     Their losses are enormous even during a campaign.     Drastic action is taken against desertion. Caps a^?e filled up by mobilisation but in newly occupied areas this is only carried out after a lapse of time to enable propaganda to be carried out.     Then only Volunteers or men likely to be sympathetic are enrolled.Manufactures. Great efforts are being madeto get the manufactures going again.     Trade and Industry are chaotic but the Nationalisation of Industry just saved it from total wreck as the poor remnants of the stocks of war material were thus evenly distributed amongst the various undertakings, The Arm.3 Factories at Tula are now working well and are reported to be turning out 20,000 rifles and 2,000 machine guns a month,     large stocks of war material have been captured from Kolchak and Denikin and there is no probability of the Bolsheviks being short for a long time.     Lack of Locomotives is serious difficulty and prevents them getting coal away from the Donetz basin.D.     Iled Army,
D.      Bed Army..   One quarter of the Bad Army troops now approach the&quot;&apos;Popular Array standard,,   The infantry are bad, The High Command relies for bucoops on the employment of cavalry masses, and stirring up trouble in rear of Denektn&apos;s forces .3J.      Causes of ;mooessz..(a) Clever use of all political parties to further their own ends.(b) Comprehension of psychology of the crowd,,(c) Clever use of Agitators and propaganda.(d) Exceptional energy and organising power,(e) Winning over sympathy of people in front areas and using them to advantage of Red Army.(f) Political mistakes of Denekin (agrarian laws &amp;c.)(g) Robbery and violence of Denekin&apos;s troops(h) Swamping of Volunteer cadres by mass of conscripts on whom agrarian laws and Officer Landlords had bad effect,(i) International Brigades composed of German prisoners-of-v;ar (Richter stated that Germany had sent no officers and no troops),Fo      German Policy,,   Although Germany is not officially supporting the Re&quot;d*&quot;&quot;x\rmy their agents are everywhere working towards the commercial exploitation of Russia,     When peace amd order are restored Germany hopes to have some direct land communication with Russia,   The &quot;joviet professes an especial dislike for &quot;Official Germany&apos;1 because &quot;it has not laid down its arms in the struggle against Bolsheviks,&quot; (Note,,   It is supposed that this refers to suppression of Spartaoiat movement,) On the other hard there is close touch between the Soviet and the German Socialists and much is being done to help Germany, et.go Russian private Industry being destroyed in favour of German Commercial enterprise.I8Go        Soviet, External Policy,,     The Red armies are now reorganising their Lines of Communication and will then endeavour to capture Tlkhoretzka so as to facilitate their advance to Baku,J They are now reorientating their ideas and are now determined to gain support in China and Korea.   Recently there has been noticed a great increase in the number of Chinese troops with the Red Army and Chinamen in the towns0   India, Persia and Afghanistan are being systematically propaganded and both civil and military missions are being employed0The Soviet particularly feels the Allies Blockade and in consequence is prepared to make peace with Poland. Finland, and   I the Baltic States on almost any terms even to territorial concessions and payment of their National Debts0   It is thought, however, that the Soviet will look upon any present, peace as a breathing space only, aril when refreshed will resume operations   I against the civilisation of the world.i IH,      Soviet Internal Policy,   Their attitude towards Denekin&apos;s and- kolchak&apos;a armies is irreconcilablee   They refuse to consider any form of peace, truce, or understanding with them,.;; and are determined to exterminate them.   They wish to get the Cossacks on their side as they fear the presence of numerous warlike Cossacks on their flanks and rear, able (if neglected) to deal them a severe blow.     They have madetherefore, the following offer to the Cossacks(a) Cossack States will not be done away with,(b) Cossack rights and land privileges will be preserved and the landlords excluded.(c) Pull religious toleration,(d) Autonomous rights of Cossacks will be preserved on condition that they adopt the soviet System of Rule,(e) The absolute condition on which these terms are granted is immediate cessation of war, Russian National feeling is against the independence of the Cossacks and the Soviet would not, therefore, agree to
recognise it.     The Soviet Power proposes to restore the form er frontiers of Russia and they look with suspicion on the tendency of the Ukraine towards independence.   This policy of the Soviet has the full support of the Russian people,Political Life.   As a consequence of the denial of political freedom political life has practically died out, and the only recognised party was the Communist.   But Communism is now splitting into two streams) Revolutionary Communism led by Lenin, who still advocates the carrying out of the full communist programme: and Practical Communism led by Trosky who is prepared to make concessions to circumstances.   At the last sitting of the Central Soviet an opposition came to life - The Menoheyiks and International Mencheviks formed an opposition but at the same time expressed their determination (togethpr with the Bolsheviks) to protect the Revolution against Reactionaries *Owing; to the extreme difficulty of applying practical Communism a modification of the Soviet Power is being evolved and is proceeding on the lines given below-   But it is anticipated that when adequate supplies of coal9 grain and oil are available which will facilitate the carrying out of the more extreme policy, it will be reverted to.J*      involution of soviet Power,.,(a) Purification of Soviet Institutions; removal of bad elements; employment of all available &quot;Intelligentsia&quot; 6(b) Abolition of &quot;Mass Terror&quot;,,   To be replaced by individual sentences of the &quot;iiixtraordinary Commission&quot; ,(o)     Abolition of the Agrarian Laws (forced on them by the peasants risings of 1919) and the reinstitution of Peasant&apos;s rights and the abolition of Committees of Poverty.(d) Change in attitude towards Cossacksu (see above)(e) Trade Concessions,   Directors allowed to run their own businesses t control their own workmen and share in profits., ,(f) Free Trade.    (Food Shops again allowed in Moscow 0)(g) Abolition of fixed prices and regulation of bread by CommitteeScK.        Internal Administration,,   In the whole of Sovdepia a decrease of crime is noticeable, especially of robbery (there -.. is nothing left to steal).   The authorities have instituted successful measures against alcoholism,.and drunkensss in the street is punishable by shooting.    (Recently at Tula the President of the Military Revolutionary Committee and his a-de-c were shot for being drunk in public)Robber;/ is also punishable by shooting0 All stores, provisions and clothes are now equally distributed (ire,, all are equally poor.)They are carrying out a campaign against the speculation of their own employes.   The Army recently benefited greatly by a Reign of Terror amongst the Store Intendants.   But petty profiteering appears beyond control.Lo        National Health.   The -Soviet has been especially fortunate in measures taken to preserve National Health. In 1916 -1919 there were 1,700,000 sick with typhus and cholera0   Since then these epidemics have practically ceased.   This is attributed to the measures taken to transfer tho people from t,h*ir miserable habitations to the better houses of the rich and middle-classes in the towns , and to the increased activity of the Medical Services owing to their pay and rations being increased. The Bolshevik&apos;s advance to the South and iiast has resulted in a recurrence of disease, as the Tied Armies are being Infected by the people .M*        Education.        The activity of the Education Committee must also be remarked.   Big credits have been voted and the status of teachers has been improved.   In order to attract students free food is provided as well as free school.   But the attendance is still unsatisfactory and the authorities are drawing on the dregs of the child population to fill up.   The Higher and Technical school are receiving much attention.   The principle of students entering
the Universities without possessing anyqualifications has been abolsihedoNo Religion.   The Orthodox Church is not beingpersecuted, but Soviet propaganda attempts to degrade it and to lower its prestige with the people.   Its ceremonies and priesthood are laughed at, and a recent exhibition of so-called sacred relics in churches where the powers knew these to be artificial led to a fall of religious belief.   Part of the Priesthood is showing a tendency to accept the Soviet. Many foonast/ries have been turned into labour Communes.   The other religions - Catholic, Mahomedan &amp;o* are submitted neither to persecution nor redicule.0. Future Power.   The Commune must fall, but the Sovietframework will continue as the People are very favourably disposed towards it.   Its strength lies in the fact that it is not democratic but combines itself to a sufficient extent the historical ideas of monarchism and centralization which the people have not yet outlived, &quot;haiever may be the final constitution of Russia it can only exist if its fundamental idea is &quot;Land for the People&quot;. Any attempt at a Land Reaction will lead to nothing and the best assistance the Soviet has had have been the Landlords who have joined the Volunteer Army. The People feel so strongly on this subject that they are discontented with the Soviet because certain large estates and experimental farms remained under the control of the Soviet.   The legislative authority of the workmen must also be recognised.   Restitution of private ownership in enterprise is certain.Pe General*   No leaders have appeared from the people.Makhno and Mamontov are extremely popular. W-amontov1 s popularity is due to his bluff good nature, his release of all conscripts and distribution of food s$0cks during his raid.   The Soviet propagandists understand the temperament of the people and although there hafee been numerous caricatures of Denikin, Kolchak and others there have been none of Mamontov.10. In view of no Naval information being obtained fromthis officer the Russian Authorities have been requested further to examine him of Naval matters, especially as regards the disposition and strength of the Bolshevik flotilla on the Volga.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your Obedient Servant,(signed) G.C. luuirhead Gould.Lieutenant Commander.The Commander-in-Chief, MEDITERRANEAN.
