SECRET.VI circulate this telegram for the information of my colleagues.II. A. L. F.91h March-1920.-   B3o      )1From Viceroy, Home Department, 6th March 1920.Clear the line.Turkish settlement. Messrs. Crum and Paton, representatives of Bengal and Bombay Chambers of Commerce on the imperial Legislative Council, have addressed the Viceroy as follows, on behalf of the Committees of the two Chambers, regarding the situation which has arisen over the settlement of the Turkish Peace terms : -&quot; (R.) Until now, the non-official British communities, which we represent have, in view of the pronouncements of Prime Minister and others, taken no part in the discussion. But (&apos;? in) face of agitation which has lately been started in Great Britain, we feel our intentions may be mistaken, both by people of Great Britain and by loyal Moslem community in India, were we to remain silent.&quot; We know how genuine, deep-rooted and intense is feeling of Indian Moslems in matter, and we should be wanting in duty if we did not plainly state our disagreement with those who are urging a settlement on lines greatly devoid of sympathy for wishes of those Indian Moslems, whose help in a large measure assisted in defeat of their own go-religionists.&quot; At the same time we would desire to dissociate ourselves from views of those Prelates of our Church who, necessarily ignorant of Indian Moslem sentiment, have entered into controversy, thus investing it, in eyes of Moslems, with religious semblance which they can never have intended.&quot; It is to the British Empire, as greatest Moslem Power in World, that Muhammedans of India now look, and we therefore trust that Your Excellency will continue to press with vigour the representations of our Moslem fellow subjects to effect that, especially as regards Constantinople and Holy Places of Hedjaz, every care will be taken in Turkish Peace terms to avoid interference with Moslem religious beliefs and scruples.&quot;io 1102     100  3/20
