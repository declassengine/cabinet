Minute Ko. 2, Sir A-Griffith-Boscawen, at my request, has consulted ropresentatiTtfis of the Central Landowners Ass oca at ion as to the p.;-cpojtd relief Of clcrioal tithe rent charge from a portion of the ra+esa t.o   -which they are now subject.&quot;    Ho ascertained from then that no opposition is likely to be raised to a proposal that  .,   itiths rent charge attached-.to a benefice and now entitled to the benefit of the Tithe Rent Charge (Hates.) Act, 1099, should, during the remainder of tho period in which the tithe rent charge is fixed by the Tithe Act, 1918, be relieved from payment of any r&amp;tes assessed at a higher rate than was in force in tho year 1910; that strong opposition would be offered to any proposal to extend this relief to tithe rent charge property of lay owners;   and that they considered it inadvisable and undesirable to give any relief on these lines to capitular tithe rent charge, even though to some extent this nay be regarded as clerical tithe rent charge.The representatives of the Association asked that the terms of redemption of tithe rent charge under the Tithe Act, 1918, which provide for a deduction of the rates paid or payable during the three years preceding the redemption, should not be affected by the proposed legislation.The representatives of the owners of capitular tithe -rentcharge recently placed * hair position before the Chancellor of the -Exchequer and. he is of opinion that the proposed relief should b^ given to all ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge, whether
attached to a benefice or to a capitular corporation, asthe position is very similar in tho two oases.     The capitulartithe rentcharge is about one fourth of the tithe rent charge attached to benefices.I propose that a Bill be introduced, limited to ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge,  and embodying the above proposal as to preserving the g tot us qu$ as   regards terms of redemption of tithe rent charge.L of f,19th March, 1920.
