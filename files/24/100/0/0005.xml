PHIS DOODiOUT IS Egg PROPERTY 0? HIS BKIT.UJNIC KAJES?Y&apos;3 GOVERNMENT).CABINET.J.P. 805. -Terms of Instructions Issued to the High Commissioner at Constantinople as approved by the Supremo Council.at I   .       their Meeting at 10, Downing Street, S.V.U, on the 5th.March, 1920, and subsequently concurred in by M. Millerand.The Supreme Council have carefully considered the possible alterantive policies which the lilies could pursue at this juncture at Constantinople.The first of these is the suggestion contained in your telegram No. 176 thai the Allied powers should form a bloc with the Sultan and the moderate and we41 disposed Turks to resist the irreconcilable attitude of the extreme Nationalists Party.     But the conditions of this policy is what you have described as a coroparative-ly iiKs lenient peace,     It would appear from your definition of such a peace that it is far removed from the terms.of the Treaty which we are discussing and must sooner or later impose.,   For your confidential information,in no circumstances to be divulged except to the Allied High Commissioners and Naval and Military Commanders-in-Chief, these terms involve provisionally the session of Thrace up to the lines of Chatalja to Greece, complete international control of the  fcxtxs Straits, the presence of an international force in that zone, close financial supervision of the Turkish Government to exercised from the capital, the cession of Smyrna to Greece subject only to Turkish suzerainty, the creation of an independant Armenia including Erzerum, the provable recognition of an independant Kurdistan.These terms are sufficient^ drastic to preclude the sucessful execution of the bloc policy.     If this be so, they will clearly require sooner or later to be imposed by force.     The questions to be answered accordingly are these: What are the steps to be taken?   At what time and where should they be taken?   And with what Military or Naval forces should they be imposed?The opinion
20-s-    . 6Che opinion of the Supreme Council is:(1) that in any case the Capital ought to be occupied at once by the Allied forces under conditions to be indicated &apos; . presently$(2) that the Turkish Government should be required to dismiss Mustapha Kemalj Governor of Erzerum, whose responibility for the recent occurrences in Cilicia is not open to doubt;(5) that the Turkish Government should be informed that the military occupation of Constantinople will be continued until the terms of the Peace Treaty have been&apos; accepted and put into execution: &apos;and (4) that, if there is any recurrence of these or similar&apos; outrages, the proposed terms will be rendered even more severe, and the concessions already made withdrawn.Instructions are being issued at once to the Naval and Military Commanders to take stops for the Ivlilitary occupation of Constantinople.     This should include the occupation of the Turkish Y/ar Office, and the contfol and censorship of all Military orders or despatches issueing therefrom/   But it should not in our opinion involve the general assumption of Civil Administration in Constantinople, as contemplated in the concluding words of your telegram Ho. 183,Please consult at once with your colleagues on these points and as to any steps other than those already indicated which ought to be taken either to secure the submission of the Turk or to protect the Christian minorities in Turkish Territory from further attacks *
