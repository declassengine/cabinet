bin document is the property of His Britannic Majesty!s Government).CABINETaRET PRI^SKHT TENDENCY OF V;AGES .Memorandum by the Minister of Labour *There is every indication that considerable changes are taking place in the wages situation in this country and. accordingly I circulate this note for the information of my colleagues,During the war it became the practice of many important trades, notably the engineering and shipbuilding trades, to submit their wages to the Committee on Production for periodical revision oh account of the increase in the cost of living due to war conditions, and the normal methods of wage negotiations in these trades were bus-ended.   Industry generally accepted the standard laid down by the Committee on Production and increases- . over pre-war rates were roughly the same in the important trades of the country.Since the armistice the Ministry of Labour has advised trade organisations to settle wages on a permanent basis, and most trades have taken or are taking the necessary steps.   It is now of course seen that fche cost of Hiring as a permanent basis for fixing wages is inadequate.   One effect of increased wages is to send up prices, and that in turn entails a demand for further increases of wages., Moreover, no improvement of the workers1 conditions is achieved in this way, the status quo being merely maintained,   Gome of the Unions are already condemning the cost-of-living basis as merely a &quot;fodder&quot; basis. -theOther considerations are entering into/wage settlements; the chief of which is the question of profits.   VJhere employers are making large profits the workers demand higher wages on that account and in many instances the employers admit the justice ofthe/
the claim, especially as high profits in the present abnormaltimes are frequently unavoidable.   In the cotton trade9 forinstance, where very high profits are being made, a bonus of several pounds if. being distributed out of profits to workersin the trade.   In the tinplate industry in South Wales -wages are 167$ over the pre-war standard, a recent increase of 40$having been given solely on the ground bf the prosperouscondition of the industry.   This increase is being claimed bythe men in the neighbouring Steel Works and a very seriousstrike is in progress because the employers have up to thepresent refused to concede the advance.   In Liverpool, wherethe shiprepalring industry dominates employments the necessityfor refItting.&apos;. as quickly as possible, nhips used by theGovernment for war purposes makes shipowners&apos;consider that theprice paid for repair is comparatively Immaterial.   ,The result is seen in increased base rates for the operatives concerned.This situation, however, has a disturbing influence onwage conditions generally.   No trade really stands by Itself,and all wage increases produce effects on other classes of worker by not only/increasing the cost of living and giving rise to a claim for similar treatment on the part of others, but also In attracting labour from worse paid employment.    In the tinplate trade there are 70 engineers employed   In the whole of the South Wales tinplate works.    At first the employers refused to concede the percentage Increase to them on the ground that their wages were regulated on a different basis, viz., that of the engineering trade, but on pressure from the engineers they gave way, making the rate 114/6d, as compared with about 82/-, which, is the engineering rato inthe/
the country generally.   The result is soon in a demand for somewhat similar increases in the engineering trade in South Wales,   The iron and steel trade in South Wales conceded to engineers in,their employment much the same advances/as the productive workers In that trade received, and this again reinforces the demands of the engineers in South Wales for a  Weekly minimum of  5, Similarly, in Liverpool the rates paid to carpenters employed on shiprepairing have led to the concession of a demand for 2/- an hour for tradesmen in the building trade, and this in turn to a demand for a rate of 2/-for nearly all classes of tradesmen in the district. In the meantime, the increase&apos; of 2/-* having been obtained with comparative ease, those who first secured it are now asking for 2/6d* &apos; The bonus paid to cotton operatives is bound to react on the wages of woollen operatives, whose vrages are at present regulated on a strict cost of living basis.   The Confederation of Employers1 Associations is alive to the matter, but there are numerous instances in which some employers have given way and compromised the rest.     As a result of the happenings of the past few months the comparatively uniform wage position which existed at the end of the war is being rapidly destroyed.   Trades like building, tinplate, cotton etc. are going right ahead of the engineering and allied trades which hitherto have set the standard.Another important factor in the situation is the extent to which employers are giving way, on the occurrence of a strike, to the demands of the men] numerous instances have occurred where employers have at, first resisted a claim but have/
have, eventually conceded it in full a few days after a strike has taken place.

It is frequently suggested that the Government should take some action to control wages. Sir Lynden Macassey recently wrote a letter to the Times urging that there was no wages policy and that some form of co-ordinati? action ought to be taken.  Anyone who studies the problem naturally regrets, the conflicting tendencies which undoubtedly exist, but a detailed control of wages by the Ministry of Labour would be a task of extreme administrative difficulty if not imposibility. If maximum wages were laid down, they would be avoided by employers anxious to secure labour, and the detailed regulation of the thousands of wage rates, known and unknown, which exist would be a colossal task. Moreover, it would be contrary to the is recent policy of the Government by whioh trades are urged to settle their own wages and conditions of employment, resorting to arbitration when in difficulty. Finally, no attempt to control wages could possibly succeed unless it was accompanied by control of profits.

It is, I think, inevitable that in the near future, quite apart from what may happen in regard to the cost of living, there will be a considerable upward tendency of wages and I am anxious that my colleagues and the Government Departments coming into contact with wages questions should be aware of the situation.
