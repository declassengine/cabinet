(P^pprs CP. 655 and CP, 815.)In the course of their discussion cn the future organisa-tion of Food Control the Committee had under consideration a memorandum by the President cf the Board of Trade, CP, 676, paragraph 2, in which alarm v/as expressed at the probable results of the policy of encouraging centralised buying by the trades concerned, under the supervision of the Government.It was suggested that it v/as impossible that the united efforts of a ring of buyers should be permanently directed to the interests of the consumer and that while no doubt the Government, under a system of control, wercsfeie to supervise prices and distribution, the trade combination established would continue to operate after control had been removed.Attention was also drawn to the foreign political effect of continuing unified buying organisations under Government control, which it was suggested would cause con-siderable resentment, specially in the United States, where the central selling organisations, which had been created during the war, would shortly be wound up.The Committee were unable fully to investigate this matter in the absence of Sir ^Auckland Geddes, but desired to direct the attention of the Cabinet to the doubts and difficulties inherent in a system of collective trade buying.(Sgd.)   H.A.L. PI Sim o2 Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.I. 18th Karch, 1920.
