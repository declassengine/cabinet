In the absence of lord Inverforth who Is in prance, I circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandum dealing with the lists of Stock Commodities and Standardised Articles sent in by the Admiralty, far Office and Air  &quot;Ministry in accordance with Cabinet decision of December 9th, 1919, and also commenting upon the Memoranda which the Ministers of those Departments have circulated to the Cabinet at the same time.It was hoped that the Cabinet decision would have rendered it unnecessary again to argue the merits of establish-ing a Central Purchasing Organisation; but, as this hope has not been fulfilled,, it has been incumbent upon the Minister again to present the case for the consideration of the Cabinet.I would strongly urge that it is essential to the continued efficiency of the public Service that further controversy on the question of a Ministry of Supply should definitely be closed, and the present uncertainty removed.-The. Cabinet have now before them the whole case for a Ministry of Supply and Central Purchasing.   What is now wanted is a final authoritative decision.P. KELLAWAY.Gth March, 1920.
MINISTRY Off SUPPLY AMD *&quot;mOM-NDlJIvi 3Y MIHI3K OF MDi\fITI03SfS.In accordance with the Cabinet decision of December 9 th 1919, the Ministry of Munitions hae received from the Board of Admiralty, the Army Council and the Air Council&quot;lists of stock commodities and standardised &quot;articles which might with advantage bo the &quot;subject of common purchase end manufacture.&quot;Extent of the Lists of Standardisedjstores.!Ehe limited scope of these lista would suggest that the Cabinet deciaion lia3 not bean regarded seriously by the Departments.   All three lists have been compiled on a similar basis and from the same general point of view.The Admiralty and War Office lists exclude the majority of the war like stores manufactured&apos; or purchased by the Ministry of Munitions during the war and consist mainly of articles of great variety but small value.Ordnance and ammunition; explosives end the raw materials for their manufacture; tanks; accoutrements; harness and saddlery; camp equipment (tents etc.) are all omitted.   IIo reference is made to such bulk stores as frozen meat, coal or oil fuel.   Timber is also excluded from the lists, except1, for some reason, &quot;Baltic deals, 3rd quality&quot;!It is obvious, therefore, that if the views of the fighting services were to be acoepted as to what each should continue to purchase.se. most of the advantages to be obtained from a Central Purchasing organisation would be loot.
Summary of circiimetanoes leading up to the proposal for a Minis try of supply .It was hoped that as a result of the Cabinet conference on December 9th the question of principle had been definitely settled and that ell that remained was the discussion of details.   In the memoranda submitted by the Secretary of State for War and the Pirst lord of the Admiralty for consideration by the Cabinet however^ the principle is definitely attacked, and alternative proposals are made.   It would appear necessary, therefore, to restate briefly the chief arguments in favour of the Ivftnistry of Supply,The question was first brought forward by Mr. Churchill in February 1918, in a paper to the War Cabinet headed &quot;Labour, Ita-power and Material,&quot;   It was discussed with Sir Eric Geddes,1 then First Lordt when a certain1 understanding was reached, but the March; offensive and consequent administrative changes prevented any immediate action.   At about the slame time the Chancellor of, the Exchequer appointed the Inchcape Committee which reported strongly in favour of suoh &amp; Ministry being formed.   It has been suggested by the Admiralty that the Committee had in mind only war conditions, but their terms of reference in no way suggested such a limitation and the report itself, in referring to the opposition of the Bosr-f of Admiralty to a central Supply Ministry, expressed views favourable to central purchasing which were incompatible with purely war conditions.   Concurrently with the enquiry of the Inchcap Committee, Lord Haldane^ Committee-on the, Ifeohinery of Government were considering the matter and:in their report, whioh was issued subsequently, they recommend the est&amp;establish-ment of a Ministry of Supply as a peace measure,   A further opinion in support of a Central Purchasing Department is
found in the report of the Joint Committee- -of &quot;the industrial Conference representing Employers and Trade Unioii Organisations appointed by the Government in the early part of 1919,So far as the opinion of independent authorities--theraforo is available, this is strongly in favour of a Ministry of Supply, not merely as a war measure but as a peace-time organisation.the  oase^for a Ministry of Supply.In paragraph 9 of the War Office Memorandum it is suggested that &quot;the main argument for a Ministry of Supply is to secure the benefits of co-ordinated purchase.&quot; This is a most inadequate representation of the case. The establishment1 of the Ministry of Supply rests broadly upon the principle that buying is an expert operation, just as fighting is, and that the extent and importance of Government purchases justify the setting up of an expert establishment to deal with them, which would amongst others secure the following advantages(a) The elimination of competition between Departments (e.g. for labour, materials and the service of individual firms.)(b) The organisation of Government buying for all purposes with a closer regard to market.&amp;nd labour fluctuations than is possible with de-centralised purchasing.(c) Uniformity of principles and practice as regards prices and the conditions imposed upon Government contracts for various classes of work.(d) Standardisation, as far as practicableof all ordinary Departmental requirements.fe)   Economies as regard numbers in contracting, account-ing, costing and inspection staffs together with increased scope for specialisation resulting in a higher standard of expert qualification.(f)   The co-ordination of all the arrangements formobilising the industrial resources of the country in the event of war, and,the maintenance, and revision from time to time, of a definite scheme to that end.
4.     i    1   -   mIn order to achieve these ends there is no question of perpetuating the Ministry of Munitions, as suggested in the War Office Memorandum, hut of amalgamating  -under one Minister the functions of the Office of Works, the Stationery Office and the work of a Ministry of Supply, the greater part of the latter being at present carried out by several DepartmentsflSco;pe of a Ministry of Supply *It is stated in the First Lord!s memorandum of the 5th February that &quot;it has now been conceded that the operation of a Central Buying Department must be confined to what may be called commercial or standardised stores and that the Fighting Departments must be left to purchase their own technical stores,11   neither the record of the Cabinet discussion nor the docis ion arrived at on December 9 th bears this narrow &quot;interpretation-.   On the contrary, it is submitted that the Cabinet1 a intention was to leave with the Fighting Departments only the &quot;higher classes of ordnance and other warlike stores of a. highly specialised and experi-mental character.It cannot be contended that during the war the efficiency of the fighting services suffered by reason of the supply of armaments being undertaken by the Ministry of Munitions; or, on the other hand, that the efficiency of the Fighting Servioes in peace can really be dependent upon their purchasing for themselves the considerable variety of stores which they now propose to reserve.The alternative proposal cf a Co-Ordihating Committee,The Admiralty and theI7ar Office propose as an
alternative to a Central Purchasing Organisation, that separate Departmental purchasing should he continued subject to control by a Central Co-ordinating Committee analogue to the Colwyn Committee, it is apparently overlooked that this latter Body was only suggested by the Ineheape Committee as an inferior alternative to the institution of a Ministry of Supply and that its appointment was regarded merely as a temporary expedient. It can hardly be maintained that it succeeded in bringing about any substantial modification of the Admiralty - policy of independent purchasing.   Administration by Committee is notoriously inefficient - even the strongest Committee cannot make itself effective against the determined opposition of a powerful Department.9. The War Office Memorandum says that theproposed alternative organisation would in the case of a serious war &quot;be a useful framework upon which a Ministry of Supply could without   dislocation be built up&quot;.   Such an opinion ignores the dearly bought experience of the last five years not only as regards the practical limitations of departmental expansion but also as to the very limited extent to which co-operation is possible between indfependent Departments.   It was a belated realis-ation of these Departmental disabilities that led to the formation of the Ministry of Munitions in 1915 and to the setting up of a separate Air Ministry and Ministry of Shipping at a later dato010. , Further the Admiralty and War Office alternative proposal only deals with the requirements of the Fighting Services.   The need of co-ordinating purchases clearly applies with equal force to civil requirements; for
example, a centrally directed supply of brioks and  \-1.cement is almost as essential to-day as was that for -shells in 1915.Responsibility for Inspection.On the question of inspection the Fighting Services cannot have forgotten that during the war inspection was placed under the Ministry of Munitions and that since the War the Army Council, as regards war like stores, has expressly agreed to leave in-spection in the hands of the Ministry retaining only a small supervising staff to ensure by personal enquiry and visitation that the standard of inspection laid&apos; down by the Services concerned is adhered to.There ia no justification for the assumption made in the third paragraph of the War Office Memorandum that in connection with war like stores involving possible question of life or death Ministry Inspectors would be less careful than Inspectors appointed by the Fighting Services.Storage.A3 regards storage it Ms never been questioned that the Using Department must be responsible for the detailed issue of stores and must hold such maintenance stocks at stations as the needs of the peace time foroes may demand; and it is equally obvious that the Fighting Services must also hold the complete mobilis-ation equipment required to put them on a war footing. As regards other bulk reserves, however, a system of central storage and distribution of many classes of
stores (e.g. cloth, certain raw&apos;and ^semi-manul^tured, materials, etc.) controlled with close reference to trade stocks and capacity will be found to be the most efficient method of meeting current needs of all &apos; Government Departments and of ensuring that adequate stocks are available in an emergency.The suggestion that if such central storage were approved departmental officers would deliberately aim at accumulating unauthorised stocks in their own Depots cannot be seriously accepted, and in any case the new system of cost accotuits would render suoh a course impracticable.National Factories.There remain the &apos; questions of the administra-tion of ?/oolwich Arsenal and the National Factories which are &quot;being- retained, the care and. custody of reserved pivotal plant and a certain supervision of National factories which have been sold, subject to reinstatement in an emergency.   These questions are of a civil and commercial character and should he dealt with by one oivil Department and not left to the three fighting Services to administer &quot;between them.   The ill-effects of divided control of such establishments have been evidenced during the past few days.&apos; The unfortunate demonstration of ebc-service men employed at the Arsenal would have been avoided if one department had been in a position to enforce for the whole of the Arsenal the arrangement made by the Ministry of Munitions for that portion of ths Arsenal now under their control.
It should also be noted that the Cabinet has approved of the manufacture of commercial products at the Or&amp;nknce Factories and it is hardly to be supposed that this class of work could be administered by a Military Department.It may also be recalled that the War Cabinet, on the recommendation of the McKinnon Wood Committee, decided on May 6th last that the Minister of Supply should be the one Minister solely responsible for the control of the Arsenal.. CONCLUSION.Had a Ministry of Supply and Works formed a part of our lTatione.1 organisation before the War, this country would have been able to mobilise its . full industrial strength at least a year earlier than it was able to do under the conditions actually pre-vailing, and to which, with the camouflage of a Co-ordinating Committee added, the fighting services now propose we should return.March 8t.h. 1920.
