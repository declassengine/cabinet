Your telegram of 3rd March, 252 S. Proposed Afghan deputation to England. I recognise advantage of course recommended by you as tending to tide over, period until our military position is stronger. But I am seriously apprehensive as to effect of further deviation from policy of peace treaty, which, judging from past experience, seems likely merely to intensify truoulence of Amir&apos;s attitude. In present case it seems clear that Amir&apos;s&apos; action is prompted not primarily by genuine solicitude for Turkey, but by his own political ambitions and desire to inflame Moslem hostilities against British Government. Close similarity between his claims on behalf of Turks and those advanced ,by Indian Khilafat deputation now in London points to collusion with Indian Muhammadan agitators, while extravagant character of demand seems to preclude belief that he really desires good understanding with us.Afghanistan was not a belligerent, and has no right to participate in peace negotiations, or to claim a voice in settlement, It is, moreover, almost certain that Turkish question will have been settled, at any rate in principle, long before Afghan delegates could reach Englaud. In these circumstances, it would be difficult to confine discussions with them to what would have ceased to be a live issue by the time of their arrival. Mission would hardly be content to return without doing something to justify its existence, and if it chose to prolong its stay here, situation might arise in Avhich we should have to choose between forcible ejection and recognition in some semi-permanent capacity. In latter event Amir would have succeeded in forcing our hands, and would doubtless become more intractable than ever.In all the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that Amir ^proposal must be resisted. They recognise that a certain risk is involved, though in light of most recent information,,it seems hardly likely in any event that Afghans will be ready to resume attack before next autumn, by which time we shall be in a position to deal with them. But, in any case, risk of premature hostilities seems .to us lesser evil than certainty of future trouble, as result of giving way on so vital a point.It would seem sufficient to inform Amir that as it would be impossible for his delegates to reach England before Turkish settlement is concluded, no useful purpose would be served by giving them facilities for journey.
