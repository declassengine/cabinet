ffiffis POOUIJEflP IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAINIC I.1AJESTY&apos;S GOTOBCT) 302S E Q B H; &apos; snCopy Ho,..... &apos;)   &apos;mi* 0 A B I 1 E ffi &quot;INTOXICATING LIQUOR (REGULATION) BILL. Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I am in general agreement with the views expressed by the See   ) Minister of Pensions,^    In particular,. I feel the strongest objections to the proposed Local Option and State Purchase provisions of the draft Bill.,   sir Laming&apos;s arguments on these points&apos; seem to me unanswerable.Personally I favour State Purchase whenever the credit of the State and the marker for Government stocks shall have improved sufficiently to admit of the issue of new Government stock or of terminable annuities in payment of the purchase Price* but not before,   Neither can I approve State Purchase being set in motion by any County Borough, Urban or District Council, nor by the Commission itself unless it is provided that in this matter the Commission shall act only, on instruct-ions from the Secretary of State,, issued with the concurrence of the Treasury..To Local Option I hi..ve always been opposed.   It seems to me incompatible with the policy and purpose of State Purchase-If there is to be local Option I agree with the Minister of Pensions that it must extend to prohibition, but in that case   * where is the compensation to come from?   It obviously cannot&apos; come from, a compensation levy for there will be no houses left to levy upon, or,,as. is shewn by the 10 years provision in the Bill (unworkable for the reason stated by Sir. Laming) an insufficient number of houses to provide   compensation on the scale requiredu . Clearly then the compensation must come from the rates,,for to charge it on the Exchequer would be equivalent to allowing a,particular locality to tax the nation. I therefore/veryf
TREASURY, SX,March 17, 1920.strongly support the omission., of the Local Option proposals and the postponement of any attempt to legislate on State Purchase till the condition of our finances allows us to deal with the subject by immediate practical steps.(Initialled)   ,1.0.
