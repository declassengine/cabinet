In view of the increase of drunkenness in many parts of the country, the Executive feel compelled to call the attention of the Government to the grave disadvantages to the nation resulting from this delay.   They recall the statement by the prime Minister, to the Deputation from the Council received on November 20 last, that &quot;the Bill will be introduced before Christmas&quot;; and they would emphasis the fact that the lon$ delay is occasioning mistrust of the determination of the Government to d-il at an early date and adequately with the drink question.Further, they desire to call attention to the notable development in public opinion in favour of Local Option, since the Deputation from the Council waited on the Prime Minister last-November.-   This is very marked in the Churches
and particularly among women electors. The Executive renew the claim made on behalf of the Churches last November that the promised Bill shall include provisions for conferring upon localities the right to decide the extent or continuance of the liquor traffic in their midst."

Yours faithfully,

(Sgd.) HENRY CARTER.

Hon. Sec.

Sir Maurice Hankey, G.C.B.
