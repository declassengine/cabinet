P. 828.WH3AT PRICES.Mono ran dura by. the Parliament b ry secretary to the linistry of-Agriculture and&quot;ffiihories.In the absence of Lord Log, who is away ill, I have to ask the Cabinet to reconsider the announcement as to wheat prices which was approved by the Cabinet on March 4th (Cabinet 13 (20) Minute 9)* That announcement was as followsIt is hoped that before the Autumn of 1921 the importation and control of the price of whoat by the Government will have ceased,,, and that farmers will secure &quot;the benefit of. a free market at &apos;&quot;orld&apos; n prices.^&apos;So long as wheat is still controlled, and thereby deprived of a free market, the controlled price of home-grown wheat of sound milling quality, harvested in 1^21, will be the average (c . i .fl&quot;J-price for&quot; the twelve &quot;months&quot;&quot;ending August 3lst, 1921t of * imported whoaiPof similar o&quot;r comparable qua 1 ity, &quot;provided that the price so paid to the; home-grower shall not exceed&quot;100/^&quot; per quarter of ^04 lbs.It will be observed that the announcement deals only with theprice of the 1921 wheat crop, and grave dissatisfaction is being ex-prosscd at the absence of any announcement as to the price that willbe paid for the wheat crop of 1920. Numerous representations have beenreceived at the Ministry to .the effect that so far from wheat growingbeing stimulated by the Government announcement, it will have the reverse effect and that not only will there be very little sowing ofspring wheat, but much of the winter wheat-will be cross drilled withbarley or oats, so as to obtain a mixed ctop-, which can be fed tostock and will be worth More to the farmer than wheat at presenttj prices.   The prevalent feeling among farmers was accurately expressed at the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society by a prominentagriculturist who said he had never knoTOfarmers so angry, and anotherfarmer at the Central Chamber of Agriculture said farmers felt theycould not trust the Government till they were dealt with more honestly.
The dissatisfaction felt by the a^rioiiltural-.^oiiin]unity&quot;^ra,s-^eX&quot; pressed vigorously by their representatives in the Plouse of--Commons-last night and serious opposition, was only averted by a promise that we would ask the Government to reconsider the matter,I would urge therefore that the Cabinet should apply to the wheat crop of 1920 the same principle &apos;c.iat has been adopted with regard to the 1921 crop, vis, thVc. the Wheat Commission should pay for home-grown wheat of sound milling quality harvested in 1920 the monthly average (c*i*f.) price of imported wheat of similar tr comparable quality, subject to a maximum of 100/- PGr Quarter of 5C4 lbs.This would meot all reasonable demands on the part of the farmers and would tssxjtq. the grievance under which they suffer at present of contributing to a reduction of the bread subsidy by having to sell their wheat at an artificially low price.It may be pointed out that the Labour members of the Royal Commission on Agriculture expressly recommended that so long as prices of cereals are controlled by th- Gcv\l-nt , the farmers should be paid at prices not less than those at which the commodities--ties controlled can be imported.    This recommendation would give the farmers the world price for their wheat without the limit of any maximum.It has been objected that an announcement on the lines suggested would have the result that farmers would hold up their 1919 wheat till after, tha harvest of 1920 in order to obtain the higher price, but our information is that there is less wheat re-   .. maining on the farms than at the correoponding period in each of the last two years and that the total amount remaining is not mfcta than 1,000,000 quarters.    It is unlikely that any largo proportion of this&apos;wheat would be held over in view of tho fact that farmers require the straw and that they have not as a rule adequate facilities for storing grain.
In any ria&amp;e- an announcement as to the price for 1920 must be made at once if nonfidonce in the-Government is to be restored and the danger of a serious -drop in wheat production avoided.(Signed)    ARTHUR G. BOSCATO,Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, 10th March, 1920.
