At present the maximum term for such leases is 31 years,.(3) Clause 3 makes the Solicitor of the Duchy a corporation sole and enables grants of administration to be made to the Duchy Solicitor where His Majesty becomes entitled by right of the Duchy to the personal estate of a deceased person.(4) Clause 4 gives to the office of Vice-Chancellor of the. County Palatine (the permanent nature of which is recognised in the Chancery of Lancaster Act, 1890) statutory stability.

The provisions of the clause follow the terms of recent patents of appointment to the office and of the sections of the Judicature Act, 1875, which prescribe the qualifications of High Court Judges.(5) Clause 5 makes provision with respect to the testing of writs issuing from the Palatine Court.(6) Clause 6 makes provision for the appointment of a person to act as deputy for the Chancellor. .
