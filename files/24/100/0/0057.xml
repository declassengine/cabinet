, .:U Document is the : ; pejStats for the Colonies.I circulate to the Cabinet a telegram from the .J^emor--Ckmml of New Zealand submitting a surest!on from the New ZealancU-QoTBrnrnent to the*effeot that an Imperial holiday should be set aside annually in celebration of victory and the conclusion of peace.It will be remembered that a Conference of Ministers on February 2nd last had before them a proposal by the Empire Movement Committee advocating the annual religious observance of Empire Day.    No final decision on that question was reached, but it was agreed that the claim cf Empire Day in this connection was less strong than that of the anniversary of the Armistice (November 11th).,I think the surest ion that there should be one/day of observance common tc the whole Empire deserves encouragement and support, and 1 should be s&amp;ad to be given Cabinet authority to inform the New Zealand Government that we surest that November 11th would be the most suitable date for the purpose, and that we propose to consult the other Dominion Governments on the subject.in30.
