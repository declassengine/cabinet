REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THIS, NATIONAL WHITLEY COUNCIL ON .THE REORGANISATION 0? THE civil SERVICE * Covering Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,.The Committee by whom this report is presented, was appointed in October last &quot;to consider the scope of the duties at present allotted to the clerical classes in the Civil Service; to report on the organisation most appropriate to secure the effective performance of these duties; and to make recommendations as to scales of salary and method of recruitment T,*     On the &quot;official&quot; side, the Committee consisted of eleven officers of high standing in the Civil Service, and on the staff side, of thirteen representatives of Federations and Associations of Civil Servants,     Its Chairman was Sir Malcolm Ramsay, the Controller of Establishments.The findings of the Committee are unanimous and the report is signed by all members of the Committee without reservation.The Committee1s conclusions on the three main problems - recruitment-, organisation, and conditions of service - included within its terms of reference , are based on a reasoned definition of the various kinds of work that the Civil Service has to do.     It is represented that tho work of the clerical and administrative branches of the Civil Service falls into four main classes, namely ;-(a) work of a simple mechanical kind.(b) work consisting in the application of(well defined regulations, decisions and practice/to
to particular cases, (o) the higher work of Supply and Accounting and other executive and specialised branches of the Service,(d) work concerned with the formation of policy, with the co-ordination and improvement of Government machinery and with the general administration and control of the Departments of the Public Service. Arguing from this definition, the Committee recommends that provision should be made for four types of agency, a Writing Assistant Glass, a Clerical Class, an Executive Class and an Administrative Class, and for recruitment to these classes at ages fixed in each case bo as to correspond as closoly as possible with the completion of well defined stages in the educational system of the gountrueA cardinal feature of the Committee&apos;s report is its insistence on equality of opportunity for promotion.   - The four classes are not to be in watertight compartments; on the contrary, the.fullest possible opportunity is to be afforded for advancement, on merit, from class to class?The scales of salary proposed by the Committee are framed on a pre-war basis, and do not include any bonus addition on account of the present abnormal cost of living.     They are, on the whole, appreciably more generous than tho permanent scales now authorised; but a revision of salaries in the clerical and administrative branches of the Service is long overdue, and the new scales are certainly not extravagant. Salaries over  500 are left o/er for separate consideration.Other
Other proposals of the Committee under the heading of conditions of service provide for an improvement in the present allowance of annual leave and for the standardisation of the practice of givng a weekly half holiday.The report goes vary fully into the questions of the employment of women.     Under the heading of recruitment, it is agreed that women appointed to the two highest classes should, at the present stage,he recruited within wider age limits than those prescribed for men and by means of impartial and authoritative Selection Boards instead of by written examination;   but that this arrangement should be purely provisional, and subject to review by the Fational.Council within the next five years..   . As. regards conditions of serrice, it is agreed that women employed in the clerical- and administrative branches should be given equal status and authority with men;    that they should be regarded as&apos; available fcr employment on the same work as men within&quot; the several classes;    and that they should be given, equally with men, the fullest possible opportunity of proving their administrative capacity.   And on the subject of remuneration, it is agreed that women and men in the several-classes should start at the same rate cf salary and that their annual increments should bo identical up to a point.     The basic scales proposed for men and women run as follows :-lion.        200-20-24-0-2^-500AdminAwibrative Class-Women.   -  200-80-400.Executive&apos;
Clerical Clans,Men,       100-10-130-15-400Women.    100-10-300..Men on entry  60; at ago l8,- ^-100-10.-120-15-150-10-2501Women on entry  60; at age 18,  80-^-120-71-180.The recommendations of the Committee mark a definite advance in the relative status of women in the Civil Service, and 1 trust that they will he endorsed by the Cabinet.     So far as remuneration is concerned, the increases proposed for women are substantially more generous than those proposed for men;   and if it were claimed&apos;that the remuneration of men and women should be based on the principle of equal pay for equal work, I should not be prepared to say that the scales proposed by the Committee reflect unfairly the present relative value of men&apos;s and women&apos;s work in the clerical and administrative branches.     The Committee refrained, wisely in my judgment, from approaching the problem of remuneration from this angle, and confined itself to specific recommenda-tions based on the general merits of the case.   To go as far as the Committee recommends will mean undoubtedly a largely increased salary bill for women;     to go further than this by insisting on equal pay throughout would involve an extra expenditure which is difficult to calculate but which in the Civil Service might easily amount to six millions a year.    ,And it would, of course,&apos; bo impossibleExecutive frtas3.

If the test of a common v/rli^en examination wore applied now to r*en and worsen alike, the result mi?ht well be that the number of women qualifying for appointment would be either short of the number for whom work adapted to their capacity was available, or in excess of t&apos;e Unit within which women could be provided t/Ith suitable employment.    If the number of women oualifylhg for appointment turned out to be negligible, women could not in fact bo given&apos; a full and liberal opportunity of demonstrating their fitness for higher ad iuistrative work.    Conversely., if the number of women qualifying for appointment was-larger than could be immediately nroviCed for, it would be impossible to take candidates from the examination list in strict order of merits    This argument assumes (as; in my opinion, it must be Artcurar.0.) that at the &quot;orosont stage women cannot suitably bo employe1, in all departments of the adminis-tration;   that, for instance, they cannot at this moment supersede riert in Die higher ranks of the fighting&apos; &quot;iepartments, or      the direction of executive depart:units in which officers/of

VC1REPORT.I.-INTRODUCTORY NOTE.1.   At the Second Meeting of the National Council for the Administrative and Legal Departments of the Home Civil Service on 14th October, 1919, it was resolved : &quot; That a special committee be appointed to consider the scope of the duties at present allotted to the Clerical Classes in the Civil Service; to report on the organisation most appropriate to secure the effective performance of these duties ; and to make recommendations as to scales of salary and method of recruitment. That it be an instruction to this committee to present a report by 31st January next.&quot;A joint Committee was thereupon appointed, composed of members nominated by the Official and Staff Sides of the National Council, and the first meeting was held on 25th November, 1919.2. The instruction given to the Committee to present a report by 31st January of this year has compelled them to concentrate their attention upon the broad structure of the clerical organisation of the Civil Service, and to defer for the time being the consideration of other parts of the task set them.II.-GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.3. We are not the first, as we shall not be the last, group of persons appointed to review the organisation of the Public Service. The Civil Service, like other great institutions, has its own historical background, and its structure reveals on analysis the handiwork of successive reformers. But there are certain considerations attaching to the present enquiry which merit attention.4. To begin with, this is the first occasion on which a body composed entirely of present or past Civil Servants, possessing among them a wide and varied experience of the Public Service, have been given the opportunity of framing a scheme for its reconstruction.5. In the second place, the five years of war have left their mark upon the Civil Service. The necessities of war called into being new and improvised Departments of State for the conduct of administrative operations on a scale altogether beyond parallel and touching almost every branch of the economic life of the nation. The result has been a quickening of the interest taken by Civil Servants in the organisation of the Service, and a fuller realisation of the need for overhauling its machinery.6. Even before the war it had become recognised that with the increase of legislation the business of Government had developed enormously both in volume and complexity. This development has rather been accelerated than arrested by the war. As a consequence, it has become more than ever an imperative necessity so to reconstruct the Civil Service as to enable it to discharge, with increasing efficiency, its primary functions of advising and assisting Ministers of the Crown ; of implementing the policy prescribed by Ministers and by Parliament; and of carrying on the day-to-day administration of the King&apos;s Government.7. The third and perhaps the most important feature that distinguishes our enquiry from any that have gone before it, is its recognition of a new principle of co-operation in the Public Service. It is only six months since the first meeting was held of the National Council -which embodied the application of the Whitley method to the Administrative and Legal Depart- . ments of the Civil Service. That a group of persons drawn from every part of a graded Service of the Crown should be able to present an agreed report upon the form and shape their Service should take is a notable and hopeful achievement.in.-THE RECRUITMENT AND STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE.8. In considering the question of the employment of women in the Civil Service, it must j be noted that Parliament has laid down the principle that a person shall not be disqualified on grounds of sex from the exercise of any public function.. We appreciate that it is not possible. at this stage to attempt a final solution of the novel and complex problems involved in the employment of women, side by side with men, throughout the several classes of a graded service of the Crown. We are by common consent breaking new ground. But it has been our earnest endeavour, while realising that we are working in a field of strictly limited experience, to ensure that the opportunities afforded to women of proving their fitness to discharge the higher administrative duties of the Civil Service shall be full and liberal.(3804)   Wt. 39407/45/328  2/20  5m  D.SI.

9. In the application of this principle we wore met at the outset with the claim, which has the support of a number of members of the Committee, that in recruitment, status, pay and general conditions of service, there should be no differentiation between the sexes. In the direction of meeting this claim, we are agreed that within the parallel classes of the Civil Service women should be given a status and authority identical with that accorded to men. Further, whilst we propose that during the experimental period there should be separate Establishment Lists for men and for women within each class of the Civil Service, and that promotion for men and for women should proceed separately as vacancies occur in the higher establishment reserved for either sex, we are of opinion that the principles of training and of promotion that we have recommended for men should be applied equally to the parallel women classes, and that it should be the duty of Departments, under the general guidance of the Establishments Department of the Treasury, to see to it that women are regarded as available for employment on the same work as men within the several classes, and that women are given the widest opportunities of proving their administrative capacity. Whether the interests of efficiency will best be served by segregation, or by the employment of women and men side by side, is a matter on which experience varies ; and we suggest that the requirements of Departments in this respect might appropriately be discussed at the Departmental Councils. It may fairly be argued that, in order to obtain the full value of the experiment, every opportunity should be given for men and women to work side by side.10. As regards pay, we are agreed that the minimum of the basic scale in each class should be the same for women as for men, and that the incremental rates should be identical up to a point.11. We are agreed that, in the case of the Clerical Class, we are no longer in the experimental sphere. Experience has established that women are fully capable of discharging the clerical work of the Civil Service ; and we recommend that women should be recruited to thq Clerical Class proposed by us by the method of open competition by written examination. The higher examination age limit required for girls (161-171) as compared with boys, together witli the need for a separate seniority list, makes it necessary that young women who are candidates for entry to this class should be recruited by a separate examination, though the subject-matter of the examination should be of the same standard as that prescribed for male candidates.12. With regard, however, to the recruitment of the Administrative and Executive Classes, hereafter proposed, the Official Side, while desiring to retain for men the method of open competition by written examination, advocates in the case of women, at the present stage, a system of selection by impartial and authoritative Boards. The Staff Side attaches great importance to the principle of recruitment by open, competitive, written examination, and is prepared to assent to selection by Boards only on the condition that the question of recruitment will be reviewed by the National Council within a period of five years.IV-THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLERICAL BRANCHES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE.13. Our task has been to determine, in broad outline, from what sources, and by what method or methods, the administrative and clerical branches of the Civil Service should be recruited ; in what manner persons recruited to these branches should be classified and graded ; and at what rates of remuneration, and under what conditions of service, they should be employed.14. The answer to all these questions lies in a well-ordered analysis of the different kinds of work that the Civil Service is called upon to do, and in a considered judgment, based on this analysis, of the qualifications needed for the discharge of each main class of duties. An effective division of labour is of the very essence of sound organisation. Without a clear general idea of the work to be done, andof the different degrees of capacity and effort that the work demands, no effective solution can be found of the problems of recruitment, grading and remuneration15. We have not been able in the time at our disposal, nor, indeed, should we have deemed it necessary, to examine in detail for the purposes of our enquiry the work of each Department of the Public Service. In considering the questions comprised within our reference we have thought it right to rely on the common fund of knowledge that we have gained from our experience of Civil Service organisation and of the requirements of public business.16. The administrative and clerical work of the Civil Service may be said, broadly, to fall into two main categories. In one category may be placed all such work as either is of a simple mechanical kind or consists in the application of well-defined regulations, decisions and practice to particular cases; in the other category, the work which is concerned with the formation of policy, with the revision of existing practice or current regulations and decisions, and with the organisation and direction of the business of Government.
(3804)17. For work so different in kind it is clearly necessary to secure more than one type of agent. Qualifications adapted to the performance of the simplest kind of work would be unequal to the discharge of the highest kind of work ; and it would be impossible to justify the employment on simple mechanical duties of persons capable of performing the highest duties. After the most careful consideration, we have agreed that, in order properly to provide for the work falling within these two main categories, it will be necessary to employ not less than four different classes, viz. : -   (a) A Writing Assistant Class for simple mechanical work.(b) A Clerical Class for the better sort of work included in the first main categorydefined above.(c) An Executive Class; and j for the work included in the second main category(d) An Administrative Class j      defined above.We proceed to make our recommendations as regards the organisation of these^ classes, and the salaries appropriate to each, observing that we have not found it practicable within the scope of this Report to consider salary scales with maxima over  500 per annum,A.-The Writing Assistant Class.18. Women Writing Assistants are already employed in the Post Office, in the Health Insurance Departments, in the Ministry of Labour (Kew Record Office), and in the Registrar GeneraPs Department on work preliminary to machine operations (punching, tabulating, etc.); on hand-copying and transcribing work (writing out acknowledgments, filling up forms, warrants and bills) ; on the addressing of letters ; on the counting and routine examination of postal orders, insurance cards, etc.; on the casting and preparation of schedules and lists, and the writing-up of simple cards ; and in custody of card indexes. We are agreed that women Writing Assistants should continue to be employed on duties so described in the Departments where it now exists, and that its employment should be extended to other Departments, such as the Ministry of Pensions, where there are large blocks of simple routine work of a similar character to be performed. Where there are no large blocks of this kind of work we expect that it will be possible to provide for such duties by giving them to members of the Clerical Class during the initial stages of their career; but if experience shows that this is not possible without retaining members of the Clerical Class on such work for an unduly long period, the employment of Writing Assistants for that work should be considered.19. But we wish to make it clear that it is not our intention to treat the Writing Assistants as a class common to the whole Service; nor do we propose the immediate extension of the employment of Writing Assistants, except for large blocks of quasi-mechanical work which can be separated from clerical duties proper. Our anticipation is that the total number of Writing Assistants employed in the Service as a whole will not be more than one-fourth of the total number of the staff employed in the Clerical Class hereafter proposed [i.e., one-fifth of the total number of the two classes combined), and we propose that if at any time a material increase in this proportion appears likely, the whole question of the employment of Writing Assistants should be reviewed as a matter of principle by the National Council.20. We recommend that the Class of Writing Assistants (in so far as it is recruited from outside the Service) should be recruited by local competitive examinations of a simple character, with age limits of 16 to 17. The Class should not be recruited from all over the country, and the regulations should be so framed as to secure for this work the services of persons resident in the locality where they are to be employed. The Class should, as at present, be established.21. The scale* of salary of this Class should start at 18s. a week, rising to 20s. a week at the age of 17, and 22s. at 18, and should proceed from that rate by annual increments of 2s. a week to a maximum of 36s. a week. The annual leave of the Class should be 18 working days (exclusive of the usual public holidays) during the first five years of service, and 21 days thereafter.22. We recommend that there should be recognised machinery for the selection of Writing Assistants who show potential capacity for better work and for their promotion to the Clerical Class if, on trial, they are found suitable.23. We are of opinion that the normal hours of attendance of Writing Assistants should be seven a day, but that a half-holiday should be granted each Saturday, except when the state of business renders this impracticable. For the luncheon interval three-quarters of an hour should normally suffice, but it should be within the discretion of Heads of Departments to allow up to an hour in special cases of difficulty. Payment for overtime should not be made except for attendance in excess of 42 hours in any week.
JB-The Clerical Class.24. To this Class we would entrust all the simpler clerical duties in Public Departments, in so far as these are not assigned to Writing Assistants in accordance with the principles already stated, and in addition the following duties : Dealing with particular cases in accordance with well-defined regulations, instruc-tions or general practice; scrutinising, checking and cross-checking straightforward accounts, claims, returns, etc., under well-defined instructions ;Preparation of material for returns, accounts, and statistics in prescribed forms ;Simple drafting and precis work. Collection of material on which judgments can be formed ;Supervision of the work of Writing Assistants.25. We recommend that direct recruitment to this class should be by open, competitive, written examination, with age limits of 16 to 17 for boys and 16-1 to- 17-1 fQr gfds. The syllabus of examination should be framed with reference to the standard of development reached at the end of the intermediate stage of a secondary school course. Separate examina-tions should be held for boys and girls; but the standard of qualification should be the same for candidates of either sex. All entrants should be subjected to a strict probation extending over a period of one year ; and failure to pass this probation should involve discharge.26.   We recommend for male members of this Class the following scales* of salary :- 60 a year on entry, rising to  80 a year at the age of 18 ; thence by annual increments of  5 to  100 a year (at the age of 22) ; and thence by annual increments of  10 to  120 (age 24), and by  15 to  150 (age 26), and thence by  10 a year to a maximum salary of  250 a year (attainable at the age of 36).27.   For women the scale* should be as follows:  60 a year on entry, rising to  80 a year at the age of 18, thence by annual increments of  5 to  120 a year (at the age of 26) ; and thence by annual increments of  7 10s. to a maximum salary of  180 a year (attainable at the age of 34).28. We suggest that there should be an efficiency bar in both scales, at  180 a&apos; year and  135 a year respectively, beyond which members of the Class should not be allowed to proceed without a special certificate of competency to discharge the highest duties of the Class.29. We recognise that experienced members of this Class will be capable of being employed either as supervisors of sections of clerical class work or on higher individual work similar to that done by members of the junior grade of the Executive Class; and we therefore recommend the creation of a higher grade of the Clerical Class, with a scale* of salary (inclusive of overtime) for men ranging from  300 a year by annual increments of  15 to a maximum of  400 a year, and for women ranging from  230 a year by annual increments of  10 to a maximum of  300 a year.30. The annual leave of the Clerical Class should be 24 working days (exclusive of the usual public holidays) and on promotion to the Higher Grade the annual leave (exclusive of the usual public holidays) should be increased to 36 days.31. We recommend that the normal hours of attendance of the Clerical Class should be seven a day, but that a half-holiday should be granted each Saturday except when the state ol business renders this impracticable. For the luncheon interval, three-quarters of an hour should normally suffice, but it should be within the discretion of Heads of Departments to allow up to an hour in special cases of difficulty. Payment for overtime should not be made except for attendance in excess of 42 hours in any week.ft-The Executive Class.32. To this Class we would assign the higher work of Supply and Accounting Depart-ments, and of other executive or specialised branches of the Civil Service. This work covers a wide field, and requires in different degrees qualities of judgment, initiative and resource. In the junior ranks it comprises the critical examination of particular cases of lesser importance not clearly within the scope of approved regulations or general decisions, initial investigations into matters of higher importance, and the immediate direction of small blocks, of business. In its upper ranges it is concerned with matters of internal organisation and control, with the settlement of broad questions arising out of business in hand or in contemplation, and with the responsible conduct of important operations.
33. Wc arc of opinion that, in so far as it may be desirable to appoint men from outside the Service to the staffs of these Departments and branches, recruitment should be by open, competitive, written examination between the ages of 18 and 19. The syllabus of exam-ination should be framed with reference to the standard of development reached at the end of a secondary school course. As stated in Part III of our Report, we have not been able to recommend the immediate extension of this mode of recruitment to women, and have agreed that women candidates for the staffs of these Departments and branches should, during the period of experiment, be recruited by means of authoritative and impartial Selection Boards, between the ages of 18 and 25.34. Entrants of both sexes so recruited should be regarded as members of a Training Grade, and during the term of their employment in this Grade they should be given the widest possible training in all branches of the work of the Department or branch to which they are assigned.35. Whilst we consider it necessary that provision should be made for the recruitment to these Departments and branches of persons from outside the Service, we contemplate that a considerable proportion of Executive Class posts will be filled by promotion from the Clerical Class. Undoubtedly, many members of this Class will be found to possess qualifications for higher than clerical work. We recommend accordingly that the Training Grade should be open to men and women selected from the Clerical Class in the early stages of their career on account of proved ability and potential capacity for the discharge in due course of higher work. A Selection Board should be established in each Government Office to investigate and decide on the qualifications of members of &quot;the Clerical Class recommended by the heads of their respective branches as having the necessary qualifications for admission to the Grade ; and a central pooling arrangement should be provided to meet the case of those members of the Clerical&apos; Class who, though fit for admission to the Grade, have no opening within their own office.36. We do not contemplate that all offices will contain members of both the Clerical and the Executive Classes. In Departments where the Executive Class is not employed, there should be posts corresponding in grading and pay to those of the Higher Grade of the Executive Class, as defined in paragraph 40.37. All members of the Training Grade, whether recruited from outside the Service or transferred from the Clerical Class, should be subjected to a strict probation, extending over a period of two years ; and failure to pass this probation should involve the discharge of the directly recruited man or woman, and the reversion to the Clerical Class of the man or woman transferred therefrom.38. &apos; Officers serving in the Training Grade should be placed on the following scales* of salary (inclusive of overtime) :-For Men,  100 a year, rising by annual increments of  10 to  130 a year, and proceeding thence by annual increments of  15 to a maximum of  400 a year ; andFor Women,  100 a year, rising by annual increments of  10 to a maximum of  300 a year.39. We fully realise that members of the Clerical Class who fail to qualify in the early stages of their career for admission to the Training Grade may develop later the special qualifications required for promotion to higher directing staff posts. We therefore recommend that members of the Training Grade should net be regarded as alone eligible for promotion to these higher posts, but that members of the Clerical Class (normally of the Higher Grade) who reveal the necessary qualifications should also be eligible on their merits for promotion to them; and any such officer who shows real promise of being fit for advancement to the higher posts referred to in paragraph 40 should be given, as far as possible, the same opportunities of training as are provided for members of the Training Grade.40. We suggest, as appropriate to the duties of the grade to which men and women would normally receive their first promotion from the Training Grade, and from the Higher Grade of the Clerical Class, scales* of salary (inclusive of overtime) of the following amounts: For men, a scale ranging-from  400 by annual increments of  15 to a maximum of  500 a year; and for women, a scale ranging from  300 by annual increments of  15 to a maximum of  400 a year.41. We are of opinion that for members of the Executive Class the annual leave ;(exclu-sive of the usual public holidays) should be 36 working days, and that this allowance should be increased to 48 days (exclusive of the usual public holidays) on promotion to the grade carrying a scale of  400 to  500 (men) and  300 to  400 (women), after 15 years&apos; service in a grade eligible for 36 days.
42. We recommend that the normal hours of attendance of this Class should be seven a day, but that a half-holiday should be granted each Saturday except when the state of business renders this impracticable. For the luncheon interval three-quarters of an hour should normally suffice, but it should be within the discretion of Heads of Departments to allow up to an hour in special cases of difficulty.D.-The Administrative Class.43. The duties appropriate to this Class are those concerned with the formation of policy, with the co-ordination and improvement of Government machinery, and with the general administration and control of the Departments of the Public Service. For the effective performance of these duties, officers of the highest standard of qualification are needed ; and we propose that such officers should be obtained partly by selection from inside the Service and partly by recruitment from outside the Service.44. Experience has shown that the higher administrative work of the Public Service requires for its discharge a proportion of men recruited at the University leaving age ; and we recommend, therefore, that provision should be made for the continuance of the present system by which men are selected for appointment to the Public Service by means of an open, competitive examination in the subjects embraced by the various honours courses of University institutions, The present age limits are 22 to 24. Some of us are of opinion that the lower age limit should be reduced to 21 ; but as the information before us is not sufficient to enable us to make a recommendation, we suggest that this point should be further explored. We are agreed that, during the period of experiment, this mode of recruitment should be limited to men, and that women directly recruited to the Administrative Class should be chosen between the ages of 22 and 30 by an authoritative and impartial Selection Board, with or without qualifying examination.45. The special requirements of the administrative work constitute a clear justification for bringing into the Public Service qjersons possessing the high educational qualifications described above. We do not, however, contemplate that recruitment to the Administrative Class should be solely from outside the Service. On the contrary, our view is that the Class should be open to all men and women already employed in the Service who show early proof of real ability and promise of being able to discharge, in course of time, higher administrative functions. In order to meet such cases, we recommend that a Central Authority should be established to investigate and decide on the qualifications of candidates recommended by the Heads of their respective Departments, and that it should be an instruction to Heads of Depart-ments to submit to this Authority from time to time the names of young men and women having, in their judgment, the necessary qualifications for admission to the Administrative Class.46. Men and women so recruited should be regarded as a Cadet Corps from which selection should be made to higher administrative posts, and members of this Corps should be treated, so far as practicable, as a body available for service in any Department in which the Administra-tive Class is employed.47. It is in our view important that the number of persons recruited to the Cadet Corps of the&apos;Administrative Class should be limited to the strict minimum required to provide ade-adequately for the work of the higher administrative positions in the Public Service, and that the recruits so obtained should have assigned to them the responsible duties for the performance of which they have been engaged as soon as they have passed through the necessary period of preliminary training.48. We consider, therefore, that the ratio of the number of Cadets to that of the higher administrative posts should be so adjusted as to secure that in practice Cadets will be able to count upon promotion to substantive administrative rank as soon as they become fully qualified to discharge the duties and responsibilities attaching thereto. We believe that if Departments, in co-operation with the Treasury, carefully regulate their establishments at the outset and from time to time so as to conform to this conception of the junior grade as a training corps, they will be enabled to give effect to the anticipations expressed above.49. All members of the Cadet Corps, whether recruited from outside the Service or trans-ferred to it from inside the Service, should be subject to a strict probation of two years, and failure to pass this probation should involve the discharge of a directly recruited officer and the reversion of an officer transferred from another class.50. For men cadets, we suggest a scale* (inclusive of overtime) of  200 by annual increments of  20 to  240, and thence by annual increments of  25 to a maximum of  500 a year. Women cadets should be placed on a scale* (inclusive of overtime) of  200 a year, rising by annual increments of  20 to a maximum of  400 a year.
55. In concluding this section of our Report, we think it desirable to call special attention to certain cardinal elements in the revised scheme that we have devised for the recruitment and classification of the administrative and clerical branches of the Civil Service.In the first place, we have found ourselves in entire agreement with the views expressed by the Royal Commission on the Civil Service regarding the evil effects of employing temporary clerical staff on permanent work. Our intention is that all the classes proposed by us should be employed on a permanent and pensionable footing.Secondly, it will be observed that, in drawing up our scheme, we have been careful to propose age limits for recruitment, so as to correspond as closely as possible with the completion of well-defined stages in the educational system of the country.Thirdly, we have endeavoured throughout our whole scheme to secure that as far as possible persons recruited to the Service at different ages and by different tests should be placed on an equality for the purpose of opportunity of promotion to higher posts. We feel strongly that artificial barriers to promotion, where now they exist, should be removed ; and that material hindrances must not be allowed to block merit and ability.V.-TYPISTS AND SHORTHAND TYPISTS.56. We have thought it well to reserve to a separate section of our Report consideration of the conditions of employment of Typists and Shorthand Typists. The work of these two grades is intimately related to the work of the Clerical and Administrative Classes, but their functions are special and distinct and cannot be suitably combined with those of any clerical class.57. Under present, conditions the two grades of Typists and Shorthand Typists form a common class ; the proportion of Shorthand Typists in any Department being restricted (save with special Treasury sanction) to one-half of the total staff. Typists pass into the Shorthand Typist Grade as vacancies occur and subject to a qualifying examination. The present scales (exclusive of war bonus) for London offices are as follows : Typists    ..      ..      ..      ..   20s. 2s. 32s. a week.Shorthand Typists       ..      ..   26s. 2s. 42s. a week.Superintendents are paid at the rate of 50s. a week and Chief Superintendents on a scale of salary ranging from  135 a year by annual increments of  5 to  150 a year. The rates for the superintending posts are intended to cover overtime up to four hours a week, but Super-intendents and Chief Superintendents are eligible for overtime gratuities in respect of any extraordinary overtime that they may be obliged to work.58. We propose that the two grades Women Typists and Shorthand Typists should in future form two separate classes, the numbers in each class being settled on the basis of the requirements of each Department. The Typists&apos; Class should be recruited by means of open, competitive, written examination among candidates between the ages of 18 and 28. The educational test for admission to the Class might with advantage be made somewhat more severe.51,   We are of opinion that well-qualified officers of other classes who have not been )   chosen for admission to the Cadet Corps in the early stages of their career should be eligible for employment on work of the same kind as is entrusted to officers in the course of their service in the Cadet Corps.  These selected officers should; we consider, be placed on the following scales* of salary (inclusive of overtime) : Men,  400 a year, rising by annual increments of  15 to a maximum of  500 a year.Women,  300 a year, rising by annual increments of  15 to a maximum of  400 a year.52. Men and women of pther Classes (normally in the Grade referred to in paragraph 51) should be eligible on their merits for promotion to the higher grades of the Administrative Class, and if they show promise of becoming fit for such promotion in due course they should be given, as far as possible, the same opportunities for training as are provided for men and women belonging to the Cadet Corps.53. We recommend that the scale of annual leave for the Administrative Class should be the same as is now authorised for the First Division, namely, 36 working days for the first ten years of service, and thereafter 48 days (exclusive, in both cases, of the usual public holidays).54. We recommend that the normal hours of attendance of this Class should be seven a day, but that a half-holiday should be granted each Saturday, except when the state of business renders this impracticable. For the luncheon interval, three-quarters of an hour should normally suffice, but it should be within the discretion of Heads of Departments to allow up to an hour in special cases of difficulty.
59. We recommend that the Shorthand-Typist Class should normally be recruited by limited competitive examinations open to established Typists of not less than a year&apos;s service, the examination subjects including shorthand (the test to cover speed, accuracy, spelling and punctuation), prdcis and an essay. Promotion to the Shorthand-Typist grade should be open to qualified candidates in all Departments instead of being, as it is at present, restricted to Typists serving in Departments where vacancies exist. In the event of failure at any time to i obtain a sufficient number of duly qualified candidates from the ranks of the established typist class, arrangements should be made for the entry, by competitive examination, of expert Shorthand Typists from other sources.60. We suggest that the scale* for Typists should be 22s. from age 18 to 19; 24s. at 19 ; 26s. at 20 ; 28s. at 21 (or over, in the case of entrants over 21) ; and thence by increments of 2s. to 36s. a week.For Shorthand Typists the scale* should be 28s., proceeding by annual increments of 2s. 6d. to 46s. a week, and Superintendents should be on a scale of  150 by annualincrements of  7 10s. to  180 a year.61. For Chief Superintendents there should be higher rates fixed according to the responsi-bilities of the post, which vary greatly with the Department.Under present regulations, if two or more Superintendents are employed, one may be graded as a Chief Superintendent. We do not consider that a scale in excess of the improved scale here recommended for Superintendents is justified where the total typing staff does not exceed 25, but, subject to this observation, we think that the scale* for Chief Superintendents should begin at not less than  200 a year.The salaries of Controllers should also be given special consideration.62.   The leave should be : Typists. 18 days during the first five years, and 21 days thereafter. Shorthand Typists. 21 days during the first five years, and 24 days thereafter. Superintendents. 24 days. Chief Superintendents and Controllers. 30 days.63. We recommend that special machinery should be established for the promotion of members of the above Classes to the Clerical Class.64. We are of opinion that the normal hours of attendance of the Typing Class should be seven a day, but that a half-holiday should be granted each Saturday except when the state of business renders this impracticable. For the luncheon interval, three-quarters of an hour should normally suffice, but it should be within the discretion of Heads of Departments to allow up to an hour in special cases of difficulty. Payment for overtime to Typists and Shorthand Typists should not be made except for attendance in excess of 42 hours in any week. We do not suggest any change in the system of payment, for overtime applicable in the case of Super-intendents and Chief Superintendents.VI.-PRINCIPLES OF ASSIMILATION DURING THE RECONSTRUCTIONPERIOD.65. In giving effect to the revised classification that we have recommended for the administrative and clerical branches of the Civil Service, it will be necessary to take immediate account of the following classes : The First Division, the Intermediate Class, Staff Clerks, the Second Division, Supervising Assistant Clerks, Assistant Clerks, Assistant Superintendents and Principal Clerks (women), Women Clerks (First and Second Classes), Shorthand Typists, Typists and Writing Assistants. We suggest that Departmental Classes engaged on duties analogous to those assigned to the general administrative, executive and clerical branches of the Service should be brought within the scope of the revised classification ; and we recommend that the possibility of assimilating these classes should be explored Departmentally at an early date. An early decision is also desirable on the question whether, and if so by what method, members of the temporary staffs are to be eligible for admission to the classes included in the revised organisation. This question is within the terms of reference of our Sub-Committee which has been appointed to consider the position of the Temporary Staffs; and we are informed that the findings of this Sub-Committee may shortly be expected.66. The absorption of members of the permanent classes specifically referred to in the previous paragraph will depend, first, on the existence of vacancies in the establishments to be fixed in accordance with the revised grading, and secondly, on individual fitness. Subject to these general provisos, we contemplate that in the normal case existing Class I Clerks will become members of the Cadet Corps of the Administrative Class, that existing Intermediate Officers will be transferred to the Executive Class, and that existing Supervising Assistant Clerks and Assistant Clerks will be transferred to the higher and lower grades of the Clerical Class respectively.
67. Similarly, we contemplate that in the normal case Women Assistant Superintendents will become members of the Higher Grade of the Executive Class ; that Women Clerks not transferred to the Training Grade of the Executive Class will be appointed to the Clerical Class; that Principal Women Clerks will normally be assigned to the Higher Grade of the Clerical Class; and that existing Shorthand Typists, Typists and Writing Assistants will be reappointed as such.68. We are agreed that in the recruitment of women for the Administrative and Executive Classes, special efforts should be made to utilise the abilities of women already in the Service. We also recommend that where women of the new grades are to be employed in Departments in which women of the existing permanent grades are not-at present employed, arrangements should be made for the transfer, so far as possible, of established women Civil Servants from their present Departments.69. The case of the Second Division is complicated by the fact that many existing Second Division Clerks are now employed in Departments which will normally,if our scheme of organisation is approved, comprise only Administrative Class and Clerical Class officers. We are nevertheless of opinion that the class to which existing Second Division Clerks should normally be assigned is the Executive Class, and we recommend that, subject to fitness, as many as possible of the existing body of the Second Division should be absorbed at once into the Executive Class and that future vacancies in that Class (other than those reserved to women) should be filled by recruitment from the Second Division until the remainder are absorbed. The information at our disposal does not enable us to say precisely how long this process will occupy, but, having regard to the expansion of Departments and to the reclassification of duties set forth in the Report, we do not anticipate that the completion of the process will be deferred for more than a very fevy years at the most.70. We think also that during the transitional period it may be necessary to employ a certain number of Second Division Clerks in posts included in the establishment of the Higher Grade of the Clerical Class. Such posts will normally be regarded as posts to be filled in ordinary course of promotion by members of the Clerical Class, and we recognise that the assignment of Second Division Clerks to them will pro tanto reduce the opportunities of promotion open to Assistant Clerks transferred to that Class. Having regard, however, to the necessary expansion of the Civil Service, we are satisfied that the number of posts in the Higher Grade of the Clerical Class which will still be immediately available to Assistant Clerks transferred to the Clerical Class will certainly be as large and might easily be as large again as the number of substantive Supervising Assistant Clerkships and analogous posts for which Assistant Clerks have hitherto been eligible.71. The case of Staff Clerks also presents special features. We contemplate that existing Staff Clerks on scales proceeding to  450 or  500 a year would (save in so far as they may be promoted on assimilation to posts carrying maxima in excess of  500 a year) remain in their present Departments in posts carrying the same range of salary as that recommended for the Higher Grade of the Executive Class.- The case of Staff Clerks on scales carrying a lower maximum than  450 must be dealt with individually ; but, having regard to the expansion of the Service and to the reorganisation of work for which our scheme provides, we should anticipate a substantial improvement in the prospects of such officers.72. We have indicated above what we think should be the normal lines for the assimilation of the various classes ; but this does not imply that there will be any curtailment of special promotions of individual officers to higher classes. Indeed, our general scheme of reorganisa-tion will, in our Opinion, increase the opportunity for such promotions.73. Where transfer of existing officers may be necessary in the application of the above scheme of assimilation, such transfer should, wherever possible, be to new rather than to old Departments.74. We are not yet in a position to make definite recommendations as to the basis on which existing rates of salary should be adjusted in consequence of transfer to the revised grading. We propose to give immediate consideration to this subject, and hope to be able to reach a decision on it at an early date. In the meantime, it should be clearly understood that the changes proposed by us in rates of salary and other conditions of service are without prejudice to any existing rights.75. We think it possible that questions of general principle not covered by our present recommendations may emerge in the course of applying the revised scheme of organisation throughout the Civil Service, and, with the object of securing their prompt and effective settlement, we recommend that a special Standing Committee of the National Council should be appointed to examine and report upon any such questions as may from time to time arise.76. Our proposals with regard to the rates of pay of the various classes referred to above have been framed mainly in connection with the work of London Headquarter Offices. We think that the lower cost of living and other conditions of service Outside London justify rates generally lower than in London, and we accordingly recommend 
(a) that recruits of the general Classes appointed to offices outside the London area hitherto staffed by Treasury Classes should(i) in the case of the Clerical, Executive and Administrative Classes, and of Superin-tendents, Chief Superintendents and Controllers of Typists, be placed on the new scales less a deduction of not more than 10 per cent. ;(ii) in the case of Writing Assistants, Typists and Shorthand Typists, be placed on thefollowing scales&quot;5: Writing Assistants. 17s. at entry, rising to 18s. at age 17, and 20s. at age 18; and thence by annual increments of 2s. a week to a maximum of 34s. a week.Typists.-20s. from age 18-19 ; 22s. at 19 ; 24s. at 20; 26s. at 21 (or over, in the case of entrants over 21); and thence by annual increments of 2s. to 34s.Provided that existing members of classes which are paid at identical rates, whether employed in or out of London, should be assimilated on the new basic scales without deduction.(b) that the above differentiation should generally apply to any Departmental classes which may be brought within the revised classification, special consideration being given to the question whether (subject to the above general limits of differentiation) certain Departmental classes of a migratory, character, who are liable for service anywhere either in London or outside and are not at present differentiated, should be assimilated on the new standard scales, or should have special scales and methods of recruitment adjusted so far as necessary, according to the merits of each case.77. Such, then, are the proposals that we commend to the attention of the National Council; but we desire, in conclusion, to emphasise the truth that forms are lifeless things without the spirit that animates them, and that no rules or regulations have any value apart from the broad and sympathetic treatment with which they should be handled and interpreted. Administration is at least as much a matter of heart as of brain. Throughout our deliberations we have striven to promote what we conceive to be the best interests equally of the State and of the Civil Service; we have endeavoured to remedy what has appeared to us to be defective, while, at the same time, not impairing what experience has shown to be good ; and in all that we have proposed we have kept steadily in view the ideal of an efficient and contented Public Service.78. We wish to express our warm appreciation of the manner in which our Secretaries, Mr. W. R. Fraser and Mr. David Milne, have discharged the heavy duties which have fallen upon them in connection with the preparation of this Report.a week.Shorthand Typists. 26s. by 2s. to 32s., and thence by 2s. 6d. to 42s. a week.VII.-CONCLUSION.MALCOLM G.
