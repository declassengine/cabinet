. &quot; iITS DOOUMHSKT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS MMIQ MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SECRET. CABINET. COPY NO:     5CP.8Q9., EXTRADITION OF TED BX-MPER0R.(Reply from Holland).(Letter from the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs to the President of the Supreme Council, dated March 2, 192 jYour Excellency,By a letter dated February 14 last, addressed to the&apos; President of the Council of the Netherlands Government, the Powers requested that Government to reconsider its refusal to hand orer to them for trial Willam o  Hohen-zollern, ex-Emperor of Germany.The Powers do not ask the Government of the Queen tedepart from its traditional policy, hut, considering thatthe nature of their request has not been adequately appre-oiated, set forth the reasons which would, in their opinion,and independently *)f Dutch law, justify such handing over of the ex-Emperor to them.theIn drawing/attention of our Government to the responsibility it would incur by persisting in its attitude of detachment towards the presence of the ex-Emperor within, its territory, so close to Germany, the Powers express the painful impression made on them by the refusal of the Government of the Queen, intimated without any consideration of the possibility of reconciling the scruples of Holland     , with some effectual precautionary measures to be taken, either on the spot, or by making it inpossible  for the ex-Emperor (by reason of distance) to exert his disastrous influence in Germany in the future.Taking into account the reasons actuating the Powers, the Government of the Queen nas again devoted its most se-serious attention to the considerations set forth in their renewed demand, and has once more conscientiously weighed
its duty in the matter.    It has^Jiowras been unable to arrive at a a Ifferen^-e-onciusion to thaVaJxea^-escpreewdr&apos;&apos; in its Note of January &quot;21,, 1920, and which was to the effect that it oouia not defer to the wishes of the Powers.The Government of the Queen has by no means forgotten the acts of inhumanity whioh occurred during the war and against which it protested whenever Dutch nationals were innocent victims of the same, but it considers that the me-mory of these outrages can in no wise influence its atti-tude in the present case.It points out that the Netherlands are not parties to the Treaty of Versailles and that their position with re-gar d to the events of the war is different to that of the Powers.    And, as it is the supreme duty of the Government to respect the constitutional laws of the Kingrd^m.. which , laws are based on universally recognised legal principles, it can only lay stress on the fact that it would be com-mitting an act contrary to both law and justice and Incem-v patible with the national honour, were it ^o yield to the pressing demands of the Powers and to violale^ such laws, thus abolishing the rights thereby granted to *the fugitive^ within its territory.The Government of the Queen has asked itself if this conception of its duties would really place the Netherlands^ outside the comity of nations, as stated in the Note of February 14 last.     The history of Holland - to which the Powers referred when alluding to the disregard of jus-tic e from which she has suffered in the past and to her struggles for liberty - is in itself a lively protest against the truth of euoh an allegation.Although the Government of the Queen must abide by
its former reply, it is none the less aware of the--dtrtie^im-. posed. .on. it by the presence of the-ex-SmpeLroTrYVirth,in the ter-ritory of the Kingdom, both from the point of view of the country&apos;s interests and that of national security.It regrets that, because this,reply to their request to hand over the ex-Emperor to them contained no allusion there-to, the Powers appear to have received the impression that the Goverciment of the Queen did not concern itself with this aspect; of the question and did not give it serious attention.This is not the case.     The Government of the $ueen, being careful of its duties in this reapedt, has from the outset observed the obligations involved by such duties and will continue to do so, being, in the free exeroise of its sovereignty, in a position to take on the spot all effectual precautionary measures which may be necessary and to submit the liberty of the ex-3mperor to the required res-restrictions.The Government of the Queen desires to make these de-clarations in the most explicit manner, conceiving this interpretation of its duties to be well within the limit of its rights.It trusts that these declarations, which prove thatithe Netherlands have duly taken into account the dangers feared by the Powers, are such as to dispel their spprehenjions.I have the honour, etOi, (Signed) KARIIBBI.SK,Minister for Foreign affairs
