summary.The event of the month has been the Monarchist coup d&apos;Stat in G-ermany. Particular attention is called to the report on the situation in Germany made by radek to the Soviet Government (see under Germany) which has so far proved itself to be absolutely correct.Though superficially the Extremists in france have suffered a defeat through the failure of the railway strike and the formation of an International midway between the Second and Third, the position is disquieting. Industrials are doing very little work and the Dis-charged Soldiers&apos; Association has openly thrown in its lot with the revolutionaries ; the GlarU group also appears to be increasing its influence.  This makes the present coal strike specially dangerous.The Extremists have been active in belgium, but the Government contemplates taking action against^ them. There is a decline in labour unrest.In austria the Government is meditating strong action against the Communists, and in spite of the alarmist reports that reach us via Hungary there seems little danger of a Communist outbreak, unless the Bolshevik armies achieve successes against Poland and Roumania.In italy the recent railway strike showed the divisions between the Anarchists and Socialists : while the latter still advocate a revo-lution their immediate object is to provoke a Ministerial crisis and so complicate the political situation.There is little reliable information from russia. The Soviet Government is making peace overtures to the United States, Roumania, Czecho-Slovakia, Japan, and Finland. The reorganization of the transport, which is the first step to an exchange of commodities with other countries, still hangs fire ; nevertheless, the anxiety of the Communists to reopen trade relations may override the efforts of Litvinoff to wreck the proposal unless he is included in the Delegation. (Atteution is drawn to an article on the Co-operative Societies in Russia which appears in Part II of this report.)There is evidence that the conscription of labour is meeting with considerable resistance both from the peasants and from the industrial workers, and in some parts the Communists are threatening to intro-duee Martial Law to compel obedience. Their latest effort has been to mobilise the brains of the professors and feed them more liberally than manual workers, a measure which does not appeal to the masses.In the baltic provinces Latvia is negotiating with the Bolsheviks and Esthonia is drifting rather rapidly to the Left. In Finland the situation is regarded with anxiety: some people appear to anticipate a &quot; Red &quot; Revolution or a &quot; White &quot; coup d&apos;ttat.Both in sweden and norway the workmen appear to be weary of the Extremists and, though the lock-out in Sweden still continues, a general strike seems unlikely. The formation of a Cabinet by M. Branting will hive a stabilising effect.[2606] B 2
The dockers&apos; strike in holland is becoming unpopular owing to the publication by the Dutch Government of the part taken by the strike leaders in the Conference of the Third international; the strike is interesting on account of the support given to it by labour organisations in other countries.The German Secret Service is reported to be very active in Spain. Unfortunately, the settlement of the lock-outs in Madrid and Barcelona was attended with no concessions, and therefore the present quietude can only be temporary.The situation is disquieting in portugal, where a strike of Government servants and a series of Ministerial crises are complicating the position. Unless the cost of living can be reduced disturbances seem to be inevitable. There is a general trend in Portugal towards the Left.There is now definite evidence of the connection between the Pan-Islamists and the Bolsheviks.The Amir of afghanistan has not yet definitely committed himself to the Bolsheviks and is open to negotiations with us; he is believed not to favour the Bolshevik policy of incorporating Khiva and Bokhara in Russia.The Italians are reported to be assisting the Nationalist moye-ment in egypt. There is n faint hope that an agreement between the Milner Commission and the extreme Nationalists may be reached.There are rumours that the Communists are contemplating armed intervention in peksia as soon as their propaganda has had time to work.The action taken in the united states against the Communists has undoubtedly dislocated their plans. Martens, the Bolshevik representative, has admitted before the Senate Sub-Committee having received 150,000 dollars from Eussia. But while the American Extremists are discredited they are gaining ground ui Western Canada.On the whole the Bolshevik menace to civilisation is less imminent than it was; the object-lesson in Eussia has tended to modify the wilder forms of Communism in every country, and if it were not for the mischief the Soviet Government is doing in its secret machinations in the Near and Middle East, the situation would be quite hopeful.
CONFIDENTIAL.a review of revolutionary movements in foreign.countries.part i.France.* The economic situation in France shews little sign of improvement. While the peasants remain industrious the artisans of the towns are doing very little work, and when a Government takes to issuing loans to pay the interest on its debts and is afraid to increase taxation, a catastrophe cannot be far off. Influential financiers and business men are asserting that only an immediate recognition of the Soviet Government in Russia and the opening up of full trade relations with Russia and Germany can save France from bankruptcy. Contrasts are being made as to the cost of living in various countries and tables of comparison are being circulated by the Socialists which shew that in Russia the French franc still retains its pre-war value. The public is reported to be paying great attention to this propaganda and the hostility against Great Britain is growing on account of her alleged responsibility for the decline in the French rate of exchange, and because she is accused of buying goods in Germany and reselling them at a huge profit in France. Much of this agitation may be attributed to the frantic efforts which are now being made by the Socialists to assist M. Caillaux, and to represent him as the one statesman who can save France from financial disaster.The propaganda of the GlarU group and of the Association Republicaine des Anciens Combaitants is becoming more revolutionary in character and even more violently hostile to Great Britain. Since the removal of the censorship in France a Hood of literature has been issued by the Extremist parties. This is frankly Bol-shevik in character; is openly pacifist and extols the Russian Revolution. In a recent booklet, entitled Lcs BesponsabiliUs de la Guerre: le Patriolisme et la ViriU, which is published by the GlarU group, it is declared that the war was due to the egotism and commercial greed of Great Britain and that Germany was blameless. The author of this hook is said to be an official in the French Colonial Office, and he describes himself as a corresponding member for the Union of Democratic Con-trol. The policy of the GlarU group is to link up intellectual revolutionaries throughout the world, and it is rapidly establishing its branches in Europe, in America and in Australia. It is reported that the French Government has the GlarU group completely under supervision, hut that it looks upon the Association Bepublicaine des Anciens Combattants as the most dangerous revolutionary party in the country.   It is rather difficult to distinguish between the aims* A special report will be issued with regard to the French railway strike and the French Socialist Congress at Strasburg.
of the two organizations, but there is no doubt that the &quot; A.KA.C.&quot; is becoming a powerful factor in French politics. Its members are being asked to undertake not to rejoin their corps in the event of their receiving mobilization orders, and to do all in their power to bring about a revolution. The association is also reported to have ready a plan for the suppression of the Government, and for the establishment of Soviets throughout France. It is thought that the May Day celebrations which are being organized by the Goihfidkation Genkale du Travail may afford the A.E.A.C an opportunity of creating disturbances which may lead to a revolutionary outbreak.MM. Jouhaux and G-uerin who represented the C.G.T. at the International Labour Conference at Washington are reported to have returned to France considerably annoyed by the pronounced Im-perialism of American Statesmen. They have discovered that to-day liberty does not exist in the United States of America. They propose to combat American Imperialism by preventing European emigration to the United States of America. M. Albert Thomas has been charged by the C.G.T. to inform the French Government of its views and to suggest that an international campaign should be set on foot to put an end to the present policy of the Government in the United States of America.Owing to the capable action of the Minister of Finance a strike of the employees of the Banque de la SocUt.6 G-inirah was nipped in the bud. The strike which was timed to take place a few days before the launching of the new French Loan, so as to cause the maximum inconvenience to the Government, was due to the summary dismissal of two employees who were found to be the French repre-sentatives of the Third International at Zurich.The increase in the number of unarrested criminals is becoming rather alarming. The Paris police force is inadequate to deal with the present situation, and, owing to the low rates of pay, recruits are not forthcoming.Belgium. The organisation known as the Jewries Gardes Socialistes is showing considerable energy, and is becoming the most important revolutionary association in Belgium. It has lately been endeavouring to extend its influence in the mining districts. In its propaganda among the miners this association is paying particular attention to the progress of trade unionism in Great Britain and is emphasising the important part which it is considered that the Daily Eerald is playing in the advancement of the Labour movement.A meeting of the Committee of the International Federation of Miners was held at Brussels on the 12th of February. At SmilLVs suggestion it was decided to hold a Congress at Geneva to discuss the reorganisation of the International on the 2nd of August when the agenda will be: Nationalisation of Mines (a report to be presented by the British delegates); Reorganisation of the Inter-national ; and condiiions of work. The Committee passed a resolu-tion pledging the miners of Great Britain, Belgium and all other countries to oppose the export of any extra quantities of coal to France in view of the repeated refusals of the French Government to accept the reasonable claims of the French miners.
switzerland. The German Secret Service is reported to be1 resuming its former activities in Switzerland. It is not yet officially recognised,&apos; and is supported apparently by wealthy patriots in Germany who beloug to the Monarchist Party. Its functions are the spreading of pro-German propaganda arid the promotion of unrest in foreign countries. The headquarters of the Central European Service are at Lucerne and are directed by a man named Von Durand, who is in close toueh: with Dr. Horwitz and Kaufman at Basel. Corres-pondence between Durand and Kaufman shews that German Secret Service agents have already been sent to India and Egypt for the purpose of creating unrest against British rule.German commercial travellers, working under the direction of the German Legation, are very active in Switzerland, and are selling goods at ridiculously low prices, while they advance arguments in favour of tho regeneration of a powerful Germany.It appears that a sum of 4,000,000 francs to be employed in Bolshevik propaganda was deposited in the Eidgenossische Bank at Berne last November, in the name of a certain Marc Natanson. The money, according to the latest reports, is still in the bank. Natanson has died, but his wife still resides at Berne. Parvus, whose expulsion by the Swiss authorities (see Switzerland, Report 16) was clue to his revolutionary activities, is said to be desirous of going to Copenhagen, where he intends to live under an assumed name.germany. The military coup d&apos;dtat which broke out on the 12th of March was evidently the result of a carefully prepared plot, although it is possible that it may have developed somewhat pre-maturely. Until more detailed information is available it is impossible to determine how far the movement is a direct attempt at a Monarchist restoration or whether there is any other political purpose behind it. It should be remembered that for some time there have been persistent rumours of the existence of an alliance between the German Monarchist Party and the Russian Bolsheviks. It had even been reported from more than one source that, on the 10th of February, a German Mission which included Ludendorff and Von Bulow left Viborg for Soviet Russia. The danger of tho present situation lies in the fact that the German Monarchists are ready to use any weapon which is calculated to assist their policy of a counter-revolution and the reconstruction of Russia under German domination. That intrigues between the German Monarchists and the Soviet Government have been in progress is very definitely shown in the report made to the Soviet Government by Radek on his return from Berlin late in January last, a full and precise account of which has been received from a most reliable source.Radek reported that Germany as a whole was at heart still militarist, chauvinist and unrepentant; that hatred against England and even more against France was general there, and that the Military Caste, the Junkers, and the Students were already preparing a renewal of German Imperialism. He spoke slightingly of German democracy, and indicated that the liberal spirit was weak among the Bourgeoisie. The workmen had lost their revolutionary spirit, and the Radical Group had become entirely corrupted by the receipt of
funds from Moscow. The Government was consequently in so weak a position that it had to shut its eyes to what the reactionaries were doing. The general policy of the latter was a Monarchist restoration at home, and abroad, revenge.The reactionaries regarded a Hohenzollern restoration as necessary for the fulfilment of both aspirations; they did not specify any particular member of the family, but the Kaiser and Crown Prince were cm courant with all that was going on. The great in-dustrials Krupp, Thyssen, Stinnes, and Helfferich were lavish in subsidising newspapers to advocate such a restoration. Societies for gymnastics, sports, riding, &amp;c., diiected by reactionary masters and retired officers, aimed at the preparation of a national army, always with the restoration of the monarchy as its end. The counter-revolutionary movement directed by a secret Staff Major-General and Civil council, and headed by Ludendorff&apos; and Hoffman assisted by certain of the great industrials, was extending its influence and becoming a danger to the proletariat. The foreign policy of the reactionaries consisted of an alliance with Eussia and the division of the Entente.On the Eussian side German misfortunes in the Bermont affair had, indeed, cooled enthusiasm, but had not led to the abandonment of the policy. The Germans were ready to ally themselves with the Bolsheviks as much as with &quot;Denikin. Bermont, Gurko, Senator Belgard and Biskupski were all in German pay, and were working for the Alliance with a further view to the crushing of Poland. The Eussian group, represented by Guchkow and Botkine, who were working for an alliance of the two democracies rendered compatible with peace with the Entente, were regarded as pacifist visionaries and carried no weight.radek goes on to tell of his experiences in Berlin after his release from the Moabit prison, and especially of an interview with five German officers, masquerading under false names as civilians, who declared to him that they were representatives of the secret military league and made the following proposals: 1. The Soviet Government to make a Military Convention withthe League in order that the two countries should marchtogether against Poland. 2. The two Parties undertake not to mix themselves up in theinterior affairs of their respective countries. 3. The League undertakes to provide Soviet Eussia with artillery,munitions and provisions. 4. The General Staff of the League to prepare with the GeneralStaff of the Red Army the plan for the attack on poland.5. The League guarantees to Soviet Eussia all territories which formerly belonged to old Eussia and leaves the Govern-ment of the Soviets free to decide the regime under which Poland shall live.radek replied that he was not competent to discuss these proposals or reply to them in any sense, but that he would present them to the Soviet Commissioners.  He expressed his astonishment
that the Military League as monarchists could offer the Soviets such an alliance. The Germans replied, &quot; You and Lenin were not afraid of making an alliance with Ludendorff and his staff to execute your plans.  Why should not we follow your example ?&quot;To the Commissioners Radek declared that he was absolutely opposed to the idea of a military alliance, saying that the German reactionaries wished &quot;to beat us with our own weapons and introduce Bonapartism into our army.&quot; He favoured an alliance of a commercial and industrial nature. Erzberger and other repre-sentatives of the big German industries had, he said, approached him with a view to a peace with Soviet Eussia, which, they declared, all Germany desired so long as it could be assured of immunity from Bolshevik propaganda. He then proposed the following scheme for adoption by the Soviet Commissioners and transmission to Germany, declaring that he had discussed it with Erzberger and other leading German business men, who were ready to accept it: 1. The Germans will send engineers, chemists, qualified agricultural workers, railway officials, &amp;c, to Eussia. The Soviets guarantee them good appointments and complete immunity.2. Germany and Russia to organize Committees which will work out a plan for the reorganization of transport in Russia, and under which the exchange of merchandise will take place.3. Eussia guarantees to Germany the delivery of raw materials. 4. Germany and Eussia to re-establish at once economic and diplo-matic relations under the most formal guarantees that nopropaganda whatever is to be carried on. 5. Germany to guarantee that the people that they send to Eussiawill spread no military nor imperialistic propaganda.radek told the Commissioners that if this scheme were adopted and sent, Bourgeois Committees would be formed in Germany to spread propaganda and force the Government to make peace with Soviet Eussia. Should the German Government refuse, these Committees would begin negotiations and trade with the Soviets over its head, so, in the end, forcing the Governments hand.radek&apos;s proposition was accepted by the Councils of Commissars, and referred to a special Commission of the Superior Council of Agriculture, which will examine it and will submit it after amend-ment to the Council of Commissars, which will then send it to Germany.As regards the German military plan, the Soviets decided neither to refuse nor to reply to it, so that they may have a free hand in case of complications arising.The Bolshevik leaders were therefore willing, so long ago as January last, to come to an economic arrangement with the parties of reaction in Germany, which the latter were not unlikely to accept with a view to its development on the political and military side. The negotiations recently entered into at Berlin with Herr Yictor Kopp as Soviet delegate, which, while ostensibly having sole reference to the exchange of prisoners of war, admittedly extend to commercial and economic matters, are probably the outcome of the above [2606] B 3
proposals. It is to be remarked further that, while the Soviet Government definitely promises to refrain from propaganda or interference in the internal politics of Germany, the guarantees against the encouragement&apos; by the Germans of what radek denominates &quot; Bonapartism &quot; in the Soviet armies cannot be of equal validity. Brussiloff and other generals of the old regime in those armies may be encouraged to embark on a policy of foreign aggression, to which they are probably not averse, with a view to intensifying the nationalist spirit now apparently reawakening in Eussia. It is clear that the brunt of such a policy could be borne by none but Poland and other neighbouring States.Meanwhile it appears that negotiations mainly of a commercial character have been going on busily during the last few months between the Republican German Foreign Minister, Muller, and Kopp, the representative of the Russian Soviet Government in Berlin. It is believed that Kopp is trying to arrange for the immigration into Eussia of German workmen. He is said to be in possession of 22,000,000 roubles, which were deposited in a Berlin bank by Yoffe, the former Bolshevik agent, before he was expelled from Germany. Kopp is also in touch with John de Kay, who was lately in Berlin trying to organize a Society,which is to be called The Intema-tional League of Oppressed Peoples. This Society, of which de Kay is to be president, has a somewhat ambitious programme. It aims at uniting all the revolutionary parties in all the countries where they exist in the support of a common cause. It intends to employ every means to remove the yoke of foreign countries from oppressed peoples and to create political and economic unity between the oppressed nations of the world by removing all national and religious obstacles. Meetings in support of the new Society were held in Berne and Berlin in the early weeks of January, at which various Indian agitators, including Abdul Wahid, several active Egyptian nationalists, Debrit, editor of La Feuille, and his wife, and others were present.Litvinoff was informed of the institution of the new Society and it was he who put de Kay in touch with Kopp in Berlin in order that the detailed plans of the Society might be submitted to the Soviet Government. De Kay&apos;s idea seems to be to develop the commercial intercourse between Germany and Soviet Russia by utilising this Society as a big commercial concern with de Kay as manager. It is possible that the newspaper La Feuille will be transferred to Berlin and become de Kay&apos;s official organ.In spite of the repressive measures which have been taken against them, the Communists still appear to be carrying on their activities below the surface and to be more united, a curious result of the almost complete suppression of Communist newspapers being that the disputes between the Berlin Communist Centre and the Hamburg opposition have almost ceased.Enver Pasha is reported from a reliable source to have been plotting in Berlin till quite recently, and to have been in close connection with the Berlin Communists and with Victor Kopp, the Soviet delegate. Talaat was also in Berlin for some weeks in close touch with Bolshevik agents, but left a short time ago for Switzerland, where he is reported to be directing a bureau,
The Independent Socialist Party seems to he losing popular support. It has left the Second International and has not had the courage to join the Third International, audits pro-Entente sympathies have led to its being accused of being in the pay of France. The party has now decided to bring itself into prominence by demanding an amnesty for all political prisoners, the suppression of political syndicalists and the abolition of capital punishment.In response to an appeal from the Government, the miners in the ruhr district have agreed to do two half over time shifts weekly in order to increase the output of coal. The Eailway Workers&apos; Union has also displayed a more conciliatory attitude towards the employers and the men have declared their willingness to do piece-work as a temporary means of increasing production. The Kolnische Zeitung and other newspapers are putting forward suggestions for the imitation in Germany of the system of compulsory work which has now been adopted in Soviet Eussia.The strike in the Solingen area still continues, and the number of strikers has risen to about 36,000, 25,000 of whom are said to be metal workers. There are signs, however, that the metal workers&apos; strike will shortly collapse as the Extremists have entirely lost their hold over the strikers and the regular Trade Union leaders who have now resumed control have already decided to allow all sympathetic strikes to lapse.It appears that Dr. Heim&apos;s attempt to unite the Christian Peasants&apos; Agricultural Association with the Bavarian People&apos;s League (Bauernbund) (see Germany, Eeport 16) has ended in failure. The latter party regarded Dr. Heim&apos;s views as too reactionary and as a counter measure against his separatist tendencies a Bavarian League for the reconstruction of the Eealm has been formed which is composed of members from all parties;A meeting of South German Socialists which was held at Eegensburg on the 14th and 15th of February, was attended by delegates from the Majority Socialists, the Independent Socialists and the Communists of Southern Germany. A new party was formed with the title of the United Socialist Party, but it is not likely that it will meet with much success.austria. The Communists in Vienna are still displaying considerable activity, but it is reported that they are again short of funds, having already expended the money recently brought from Moscow by Steinhardt (see Austria, Eeport 16). The Monarchist movement, which is strong in Hungary, and also exists in Austria, is said to be assisting the Communists because it is forcing the milder Social Democrats into a kind of union with them. It seems unlikely, however, that there will be any attempt at revolution for some little time. The police authorities do not arrest Steinhardt apparently for fear of raising a storm of protest from the Extreme Left Social Democrats. There is reason to believe that the Government intends to adopt more stringent measures to suppress the agitators, and that it is considering the advisability of interning all the Hungarian Communist refugees in Vienna and of attempting to counteract the influence of the Communists in the Central Workmen&apos;s Councils.[2606] B 4
In Styria there is considerable Communist agitation and, needless to say, there are rumours that this unrest is financed by Jugo-Slav and Czech money. The cause for the unrest is probably due to economic conditions which are growing steadily worse.An organization of a somewhat dangerous character has been started in Styria under the auspices of the Social Democratic Party which it is intended shall protect the Republic by force of arms against the revolutionary attempts of the Right Party. Eight &quot; Labour Alarm &quot; battalions have been formed, and it is reported that these battalions are armed with rifles and machine guns. Three of the battalions hold Communist views and, in the event of a Communist rising, may join hands with the revolutionaries. The International Congress of Postal Workers took place at Vienna. on the 4th of February. The adhesion of the postal workers of Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Austria and France to the Inter-national Union was announced.There are rumours of a Government crisis in Austria owing to the general dissatisfaction over the Bill for a levy on capital.Hungary.-On the 1st of March the National Assembly elected Admiral Horthy to be Regent, and the Cabinet was dissolved. It is believed that M. Huzar will be entrusted with the task of forming an interim coalition Cabinet pending the elections in the districts now being evacuated by the Roumanians and the Serbs.According to a statement of Etienne Manthner during his trial for his connection with the recent Communist plot in Hungary, Hevesi, the notorious Hungarian Communist, has been in direct communication with Count Karolyi through the agency of a man named Twaidar Sugar. Manthner stated that Karolyi had full knowledge of the plot, and approved of the proposal to assassinate certain high functionaries in Hungary. This statement should be received with reserve because the best evidence available seems to indicate that the activities of the Hungarian Communists are at the present time concentrated in Austria.The Hungarian Bolsheviks, Bohm and Kuufi, have appealed to British Labour, through the British Representative at Vienna, to bring about a modification of the repressive measures at present being adopted by the Hungarian Authorities against Extremists in Hungary.Italy. The most noticeable feature in connection, with the recent railway strike was that it was settled through the intervention of the Socialists and that it did not provoke a revolution. This confirms the rumour that the Socialists and Anarchists in Italy are not working together. Malatesta has openly stated that, if the Socialists obtained power, the Anarchists would fare worse than they do under the existing regime and that in no case should Anarchists work for any Government, whether bourgeois or Bolshevik. He declared that a dictatorship of the proletariat would prove more despotic and oppressive to individual liberty than the present established social order.The revolutionary Socialists, finding that they could not count upon the support of the Anarchists, decided that both the railway strike and the postal services strike were of an entirely economic
character, and joined with the more moderate Socialists in assisting the Government to settle them. The failure of the Extremists to derive any political advantages from the recent industrial troubles was due more to their inability to come to an agreement among themselves than to any Machiavellian tactics on the part of Signor Mtti.Lazzari considers that, although a split in the Socialist Party is inevitable sooner or later, party discipline, the continual strikes and the imminence of the administrative elections will force the various sections of the party to remain united for the present. The policy of the party now seems to be. concentrated upon an attempt to bring about a ministerial crisis in order to complicate still further the political situation, and to take every possible advantage of the in-dustrial unrest caused by the prevailing discontent which is largely due to the high cost of living.The Workrnen&apos;s Councils (Consigli di Fabbrica) which are to be set up in Italian factories promise to give satisfaction both to employers and employees. They development of the Internal Works Commissions which have been in existence for some time and are intended to secure the observance of labour contracts, rates, wages, health regulations, &amp;c. These Councils differ from the Internal Works Commissions, however, inasmuch as their members are to be elected from the ranks of skilled labour employed in the factories, irres-peetive of whether or not the men are unionists or non-unionists. If, therefore, these Councils are definitely set up, it would appear that Trade Unions will soon cease to exist in Italy, as the workmen will have no object in supporting them. Organized labour consequently is strongly opposed to the institution of the Councils. Hippolyte Havel, who is an American journalist and editor of the Anarchist newspaper, Soviet Bulletin, and has been connected with Anarchist plots all over the world, has been invited by Malatesta to come to Italy to assist in producing a new Anarchist journal called the New World, which is to be published at Milan and edited by Malatesta.Greece. There is still a strong opinion in Greece that M. Venizelos will be defeated at the forthcoming elections (see Greece, Report 16). The supporters of ex-King Constantine are said to be numerous and well organized, while the Venizelist party appears to be divided. In this connection the recent yearly elections of presidents for the Associations of lawyers which exist in all the big towns in Greece are somewhat significant, as not a single Venizelist President was elected.The strike of the metal workers at Piraeus continues. At a recent meeting held in the Municipal Theatre of that town a workman named Speras delivered a revolutionary speech and there was some disorder when the police endeavoured to arrest him.Roumania. The only real Bolshevism which exists at present in Roumania is to be found among the artisan classes in the towns, but only about 20 per cent, of these are said to be seriously infected with the Bolshevik idea. The Army is reported to be thoroughly reliable.On the other hand, economic conditions do not show much sign of improvement, and the lack of railway transport has brought&apos;trade
practically to a standstill. Dissatisfaction with the Government is increasing, and the Democratic Party, led by M. Take Jonescu, seems to be gaining in popularity.The Russian Soviet Government made a definite offer to Roumania on the 25th of February to begin peace negotiations, and the offer has now been definitely accepted.Czecho-Slovakia. It has been reported that the Czecho-Slovak Government sent two representatives to Copenhagen to negotiate with Litvinoff on economic questions. There has recently been a tendency among the Czecho-Slovaks to look to Russia rather than to the Entente for the means of establishing the economic well-being of their republic The envoys also tried to induce Litvinoff to prevail upon the Moscow Government to give a guarantee to cease its financial support to Bolshevik propaganda in Czecho-Slovakia. Litvinoff refused to give any such guarantee. It appears, however, that the Bolsheviks have now offered definite terms of peace to Czecho-Slovakia.The proposal to grant the same rights to German subjects in Czecho-Slovakia as are granted to the Czecho-Slovakians themselves is meeting with violent opposition from the National Democrats under the leadership of Dr. Kramar, and, in view of the forthcoming elections, it is possible that the proposal may be dropped.JugO-Slavia. The Jugo-Slav Communists appear to be fairly well organised, and under the leadership of Dr. Topalovich, Professor Markovich and M. Phillipovich, are preparing vigorously, for the coming elections. It would appear, however, that no revolutionary action is contemplated without the support of the other Balkan countries; and since Roumania is reported to be particularly back-ward in this respect, no serious disturbances are likely to take place for the present.On the other hand, there has been a certain amount of industrial unrest, and as a protest against the arrest of certain of the men&apos;s leaders in the recent railway strike, a twenty-four hours&apos; general strike was declared in Belgrade, which caused a complete stoppage of work throughout the city. There were demonstrations, but there was no disorder.Bulgaria. The Bulgarian authorities are somewhat alarmed by the intrigues which are going on between the Bulgarian Communists and Rakovsky. the Russian Soviet representative in the Ukraine. The latter, who has recently sent funds and agitators into Bulgaria from Odessa, has issued instructions to the leader of the Communist Party in Bulgaria to withhold from any open revolutionary action until May, when the Bolsheviks expect to be in Bucharest.By a large majority the Superior Council of the Communist Party rejected the proposed fusion with the Socialist Party. The Commu-nists, however, agreed to accept as members of their party any Socialists who accepted the Communistic doctrines. It is thought that this generous offer will have the effect of robbing the Bulgarian Socialist leaders of their more advanced followers and so assist the Extremist cause.
Poland. The attitude of the Poles towards Soviet Eussia is still indefinite and a Conference of the Border States, including Poland and Eoumania, has assembled at Warsaw to discuss the question with a view to joint action.It is generally thought that the establishment of &quot;peace with Eussia will lead to a considerable export of foodstuffs and a consequent rise in prices, and that the demobilization of the Polish Army will largely increase the number of men out of work. As the prices in Poland are already very high and there is already a great deal of unemployment, it is considered that peace might be more dangerous than the present kind of war.Although the Communists are endeavouring to make as much capital as possible out of the existing economic situation and there is a, certain amount of industrial unrest, there are no signs that Bolshevism is making much progress in Poland. A Polish National Anti-Bolshevik Congress, held at Warsaw towards the end of January, adopted a distinctly Catholic, anti-Jewish and eminently patriotic attitude. One million marks were collected for the purposes of anti-Bolshevik propaganda.The Extremist Party in Poland, the Revolutionary Workmens&apos; Party, is stated only to have about 4,000 adherents at the present time, but no doubt its numbers will increase unless the general conditions of living become better. The existence is reported of a secret Eussian Bolshevik organization at Warsaw and Posnowitz, which is engaged in facilitating communications between Moscow and Berlin.What appears to have been a Bolshevik outbreak occurred at Kovno in Lithuania on the 21st of February, 1920. The troops in the garrison attacked the public buildings, but the Government proclaimed Martial Law and succeeded in driving the rebels outside the city. Order is now said to have been completely restored.A new Party has recently been formed in Poland which is known as the German National Peoples&apos; Party. It is a Monarchist organiza-tion and is reported to have 30,000 members.Russia. The Bolshevik leaders have now turned their attention to the reorganization of economic conditions in Eussia.   In an article which appeared in Isvestia on the 30th of January, Comrade Arski explained that the institution of compulsory labour was necessary because the workmen had dispersed from the large towns to the villages, where they were either devoting their attention to agricultural pursuits or were occupied in speculating.   The con-scription of labour is now an accomplished fact, and at a recent meeting of the Petrograd Soviet Zinovieff declared that the Labour army would have to continue under iron military discipline for several years in order to carry out its huge task of construction.   In connection with the Militarisation of Labour, a general purposes or Managing Committee has been formed, of which Dzerzhintsky, the chief of the Chrezvychaika (see notes on the oi-ganization of Govern-ment in Soviet Eussia, Part II, Eeport 16), has been appointed chairman.   At a recent meeting of this Committee plans were discussed as to the tasks for labour in 1920, the disposition of industries and natural wealth according to regions the registration
of citizens liable to labour conscription and of persons of professional science. Every worker is to be given a book showing his qualifications, &amp;c, and anyone who is not in possession of one of these books after a certain date will be sent to work by the Labour Distribution Administration. The Bolsheviks, ostensibly upon the grounds that there is an urgent need for educational works, have taken steps to mobilize the works of printers, publishers and journalists. It is clear that they are also doing their best to gain the support of scientific men and technical experts to assist in the reorganization of industry. A Union of Working Intellectuals under the Presidency of Maxim Gorky which has been formed to support to the utmost degree the restoration of culture and the economic life of the country, has issued an appeal to Intellectuals abroad to reconsider their views and convictions and to change their general attitude in favour of support to the working masses. In connection with this Union the formation of a Commission for improving the existence of the learned, with Maxim Gorky as its president was recently announced. It appears, however, that the decision of this Commission that 1,800 professors were to receive a considerably increased bread and sugar ration as it was thought that by intensive feeding the shaken nervous systems and the brain activity of the learned would be restored to their former capacity was not well received by the rest of the population. In order to justify their action in granting this increased scale of rations the Bolsheviks have now declared a general mobilization of professors from the 1879 class, in order to facilitate their appointment to posts in accordance with their special qualifications.On the other hand there is evidence that Labour Conscription is meeting with considerable resistance both from the peasants and from the industrial workers. A wireless message recently circulated from Moscow complains of the idleness in the Northern railway workshops and states that as a punitive measure it has been found necessary to introduce Martial Law.The appointment of Trotsky to the office of Food Minister draws attention to the fact that his successor as War Minister is reported to be General Polivamoff (who was at one time War Minister in the Czar&apos;s Government), with General Brusiloff as his assistant. The Eed Army is now controlled by an iron discipline, and is developing into an instrument which may before long be made to exercise a powerful influence upon the political situation.Meanwhile the efforts of the Bolsheviks to open up business relations with the outside world continue, and Gukovsky, President of the Bolshevik Economic Mission at Beval, has stated that the Soviet Government is in possession of  500,000,000 in gold and 1\ tons of platinum with which it is prepared to pay for any goods received. Five delegates of the Co-operative Societies have been selected to negotiate in Western Europe for an exchange of goods with Eussia. These delegates are Krassin, Nogin, Eozovski, Khintchuk and Litvinoff. Permission to visit Great Britain has been granted to all these delegates except Litvinoff. It is said that Litvinoff, who is still at Copenhagen, has spent nearly all his money. Further information has now been received with regard to the sale of the Chinese Railway Bonds which Litvinoff had in his
possession (see Switzerland, Eeport 16). Apparently he wrote to Bagotsky, the Bolshevik representative in Switzerland, and asked him to arrange for the sale of the bonds and to divide the proceeds between the Bolshevik Red Cross in Switzerland and the French Secret Bolshevik Society. Bagotsky eventually came to an agree-ment with John de Kay, by which the bonds were. disposed of in Berlin by Dr. Oscar Kohn, the Independent Socialist leader, and part of the money realized has already been sent to Switzerland and Paris for propaganda purposes.The Bolsheviks continue their propaganda with unabated energy. They now have a vigorous organization at Theodosia in the Crimea, which serves as a distributing agency for Turkey and the Balkans. Communication with Constantinople is probably carried on by stokers and mechanics on Russian vessels navigating the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Touch is also maintained with the French Socialists through a Bolshevik organization at Marseilles, a member of which, Rivelli, a French Socialist, is said to be the connecting link between the Russian and French Bolsheviks.Baltic States.-The anti-Bolshevik League at Reval (see Baltic States, Report 16), which at first seemed to subsist on its own funds, has now received financial support in Reichmarks. The League is carrying on pro-German propaganda in Latvia, Sweden and Finland, and among the remnants of the North-West Russian forces. General Balahovitch, one of the leaders of the League, was last heard of in Latvia, and Homutoff [or Honutova], another leader, was recently in Berlin.On the initiative of the Finnish Socialists a conference of Socialists from all the Baltic States is to meet at Reval on the 15th of March. The chief matter for discussion will be the forma-tion of a common Socialist platform against the Bourgeoisie. Social Democrats and Social Revolutionaries are to attend the conference, but no Bolsheviks are to be present.Bolshevism is reported to be on the increase in Esthonia. At a secret meeting of Communists held at Reval early in January, which was presided over by Kingissen, resolutions were passed in favour of the overthrow of the existing Government and the immediate organization of Soviets. There are now said to be indica-tions that a change of Government may be expected, and that the self-designated Bolshevik Hellatt may possibly become Prime Minister.Finland. The rumours of a White coup tfttat still continue. It is reported that the Whites have declared their intention of taking action if the Bill to permit anyone to enter the Finnish Army is passed.  It has hitherto been the rule in.the army that two soldiers must guarantee the bona fides of any new recruit, and the Whites consider that the passing of the new law will seriously endanger the reliability of the army in the case of a Red revolution.   In view of the persistent Bolshevik propaganda there is probably some founda-tion for this belief.  The Schutz Corps (see Finland, Report 15) has already been considerably affected by this propaganda.    The Extremists are reported fco be of the opinion that the time for a Red revolution has almost arrived, and the discoveries of stores of [2606] B 5
explosives which&apos; are constantly- being made and the active preparations of the Bolshevik forces on the frontiers give grounds for supposing that spine kind of coup may be anticipated. In the south of Finland, where the industrial classes predominate, peace with the Russian Soviet Government would be popular; in the northern part of the country where the larger proportion of the population consists of small landowners and peasants there is a strong feeling against sUbli a peace. In the event of a Red rising aided by the Bolsheviks it is considered that the only hope of successful resistance is German support. The Germans and their adherents in Finland are now taking advantage of this feeling and have changed their former policy to one of advocating peace with Soviet Russia.The recent Cabinet crisis is said to have been brought about by private Banks On which the present Government was largely depeh-delit. The Banks had previously threatened action unless a strong bourgeois Coalition Government was formed, and the actual crisis was brought about by the Northern Union Bank demanding payment of one-third of its loan of 47,000,000 marks before the loan could be renewed.- Norway.-It is considered that the union between the Coin-munists arid Arharchists in Norway may be due to the breach between the Extremists and the Moderates, which is rapidly widening. Puiitervold is now the leader of the Moderates, and Tranmael, who formerly had considerable influence in the Norwegian Labour move-meht and still has the support of the Transport Workers, who form probably the most irreconcilable section of the industrial community, seems to.be losing his popularity. There are indications that labour as a whole is tiring of the interference of the Extremists in all trade -disputes, but, so long as the economic conditions do not improve, industrial troubles are inevitable. The cost of living in Norway is calculated to have increased 201 per centum since 1914. As a mark of their solidarity with Soviet Russia, it is reported that the Norwegian Labour Party and the Christiania Municipal Council have assigned 100,000 kronen for the purchase of cod-liver oil for the people of Petrograd.Sweden. A purely Socialist Government, with M. Branting as Prime Minister, was formed on the 10th of March in succession to a Liberal Socialist Cabinet which had been in office since 1917. M. Branting is a member of the Right Wing of the Swedish Socialist Party, and was notorious for his x^xo-Entente sympathies during the war.The failure of the Extremists in Sweden to promote a General Strike as a protest against the recent lock-out in the engineering trade is a further proof of the disinclination of the majority of Swedish workmen to adopt methods of violence, Class hatred is said to be stronger than ever in the country, but class warfare of the Bolshevik variety -does not yet seem to attract the Swedes. Extremist propaganda, however, continues and is reported to be having some success in the Army, in which there is a good deal of discontent on account of the low pay. Conscripts belonging to the Left Socialist Party are also stated to be spreading their political views among their fellow conscripts,
As a means towards obtaining supreme political power, and in order to have ready the necessary machinery in the event of a successful revolution, Zachariassen* and Jacob Friis are giving propaganda lectures and endeavouring to form an Extremist group among the Government employees. It is reported that some of the Swedish workmen who were thrown out of employment during the recent lock-out are thinking of emigrating to Russia. Frederick Strom has assured them of the warm welcome they will receive from the Soviet Government, but it is said that the idea of compulsory labour is a deterring influence upon a good many of the would-be emigrants !Hellberg who describes himself as the &quot; Authorized representative of the economic and legal interests in Sweden of the Russian Soviet Republic,&quot; has written a letter to the Politiken warning people who wish to trade with Soviet Russia against entering into negotiations with middlemen or organizations which are not directly under the control of the Soviet Government.denmark. The Congress of the Danish Left Socialist Party closed on the 1st of March, and resulted in the Party standing for full adherence to the Third International and for participation in the coining elections.The Danish secret police state that Litvinoff and the Swedish Left Socialist Party have between them lately advanced money to the Danish Syndicalist Party. As a result the Syndicalist weekly organ the Arbeidet is now to become a daily newspaper, and the International Printing Press is no longer under the necessity of appealing for funds. The Bolshevik week, the 15th to 2Qth of February, promoted, by Litvinoff and Christiannsen, was, it is stated, a failure. At the instance of the Danish Government Litvinoff has now been warned ,to (iissociate himself from any kind of agitation.The Hamburg opposition group of the German Communist Party has rebuked the workmen of Schleswig for their display of national feeling with regard to the Plebiscite. The group is of opinion that the proletariat is equally exploited in any Capitalist State whatever its nationality may be. The German Communists appear to be anxious for the result of the Plebiscite to be in favour of Denmark because the workmen of Schleswig-Holstein, on becoming Dahisl subjects, would be a link between the revolutionary classes ii Germany and Denmark. The propaganda of Tranmael, the Nor-wegian Extremist, who has been visiting Denmark, has had little success. His speeches were not printed in the newspapers, nor were his meetings, advertised by the press.Though in some of the recent strikes in Denmark the men appear to have stopped work against &quot;the advice of their own leaders, the deduction made by some observers that the Danish Trade Unions are losing their influence is not necessarily valid.holland. A general strike of dockers, seamen and transport workers was declared in Holland on the 15th of February and stillin* Zachariassen was recently deported from England for bringing funds from the Scandinavian comrades to SvlviaTankhurst,
continues, although the original solidarity of the strikers has been a good deal shaken owing to the connection which it is alleged has been discovered between some of their leaders and the Extremists. The strike was at first generally supposed to be an ordinary indus-trial dispute with regard to wages and to have no particular political significance. It began, however, at the time when the delegates of the Third International happened to be in Amsterdam, and it transpired that Sneevliet, the leader of the Federation of Transport Workers, and Bouwm.au, another of the men&apos;s leaders, had attended Communist meetings. The Dutch authorities and the Liberal and Socialist press made the most of this information in order to discredit the strike leaders with their more moderate supporters. In this they appear to have been fairly successful, as the majority of the strikers are opposed to the Communists.It is reported that the strikers in Holland have been given a good deal of financial support from abroad. The transport workers are stated to have received money from the Seamen and Firemen&apos;s Union and the Eailwaymen&apos;s Union in England, and also from the French Union of Eailwaymen. In connection with this display of inter-national labour feeling it is interesting to note the instructions issued by Eobert Williams to British transport workers against handling goods destined for Holland, and also the efforts which are apparently being made in order to induce the Seamen&apos;s Union in England and in the United States of America to take action on behalf of the Dutch seamen. The Irish Transport Workers are also reported to have promised moral and financial support.Troelstra&apos;s attitude with regard to the present strike is not very clear, but it is probable that he is waiting upon events. He has now secured control of the &quot; Anti-Militarist International Alliance&quot; which was founded in Holland during the war, and which is said to have a considerable following among the Socialist Eevolutionaries throughout Europe. A World Congress of anti-militarists is to be held at The Hague, probably next June, at which Eoderick Clark and Arthur Gwillian are to represent Great Britain.At a Congress of the Dutch Trade Union Federation on the 6th of February a resolution was passed in favour of the socialisation of industry, not by violence, however, but by some process of evolution.A new and extremely ingenious form of Bolshevik propaganda is being distributed among the population in the poorer districts of Eotterdam and The Hague. It consists of genuine one-guilder notes with &quot; Long live the Bolsheviks ! Down with Capital!&quot; inscribed in red ink on the back.Spain. At the Congress, of the Third International, which was held at Amsterdam during the beginning of February, a letter was read from the Spanish Comrades in which it was proposed that the Western Bureau of the Third International should be located in Spain owing to the special facilities which existed for communications with the United States of America. If was, however, eventually decided to retain the Western Bureau in Holland and to establish an Information Bureau in Spain.A split in the Spanish Eevolutionary Party appears to be inevitable, and the patriotic feeling at present existing in Spain is
considered by the Extremists to be endangering the success of the Revolutionary movement.Legislation has been introduced through the Spanish Upper House with the object of modifying the powers of Trade Unionism. The Bill includes clauses to the effect that only workers of the same occupation may federate, and limiting the area even of such federations. Strikes are only to be declared after an absolute majority by ballot of two-thirds of the workers in each firm, and even then three days must be given to an Arbitration Court to endeavour to bring about a settlement.The labour situation in Barcelona improved on the Governor ordering the cessation both of Syndicate and lock-out. Though many Syndicalist leaders are in prison the Syndicate Unico is still very much alive and the men&apos;s grievances have not been removed. In the absence of an adequate police force, trouble may still be expected. Labour troubles in Barcelona are always delicate owing to the question of Catalonian independence, which makes Madrid politicians chary of touching them. Madrid is now normal, but here again the agreement come to between masters and men is in the nature of an armistice, the vital points in the dispute not having been settled.In Andalucia Syndicalists from Barcelona and Bilbao are active, and there is a movement to work up a strike in Gibraltar.In Valencia, Saragossa, Seville and Cadiz, there is considerable industrial unrest accompanied by crime. In the Cadiz district the Confederacidn National de Trdbajo has succeeded in bringing the agricultural labourers into line with the workmen in the towns, and some of the former class have already struck for a six-hour day.It is generally believed that the &quot; Syndicate &quot; receives money from Syndicalists in foreign countries. A leading member of the Barcelona club Germania recently hinted with open satisfaction that the workmen during the recent lock-out had been supplied with funds from a German source, as well as with a number of Spanish bills of old date from Russia. Recently, however, the Syndicate has been out of funds and has been encouraging the men to work in order to gather in their subscriptions. This probably accounts for the temporary improvement in Barcelona, and for the transference of Syndicalist activities to Andalucia. Barcelona, how-ever, as the most important industrial town in Spain, will always be the hub of. the movement,&apos; even though the actual outbreaks occur in other parts of the country.Matters political appear to centre in the trial of strength between the King and the apparently all-powerful Juntas de Defensa or Officers Soviet (vide Part II in this issue). The resignation of the minister Gimeno, Romanones&apos; spokesman in the Cabinet, is said to have been forced by this body. Their aim, which they in part accomplished, was to oblige Senor Alende Salazar to tender the resignation of his cabinet, thus making way for Senor Milanes del Bosch, the Catalan Captain-General of Barcelona. On the resignation of Senor Gimeno, Alende Salazar duly handed in his resignation, but the King did not make way for a del Bosch government as the Juntas had hoped, but, for the second time within a week, affirmed his confidence in the resigning Prime Minister, who remains in office with his cabinet. Meanwhile Milanes del Bosch had resigned his office of Captain-
General of Barcelona and had been succeeded by General Weyler, &quot;whom the local Juntas had sworn to displace in order that del Bosch might be reinstated. Here, too, the Juntas suffered defeat. The Juntas have had to acquiesce in Weyler&apos;s retention of his post, and have decided further that Eomanones shall not be deprived of Ins office of deputy and that they will adhere to the decisions of the Juntas Central in Madrid. The intervention of the King, the feeling that they had gone too far, not unmixed with doubts as to the reliance they could place on the non-commissioned ranks of the Army, were probably responsible for their moderation. In fact, at the height of the Weyler-del Bosch crisis in Barcelona Weyler was actually approached by a deputation of warrant officers and sergeants and assured of their support in any action he might take.&quot; And though he is reported to have received their advances with a good-natured lecture on the maintenance of discipline, the Juntas probably inferred from the fact of the visit that there were limits to their powers.Portugal. The situation in Portugal is still rather obscure. On the 4th of March all the Portuguese Government employees ceased work, demanding an increase of pay. The Government decided to take strong action and proposed to the Chamber that all employees who had gone on strike should be dismissed, but the Chamber opposed this proposal and the Cabinet, which was con-sequently forced to resign, was replaced by a new Ministry under Silva, the leader of the Democratic Party. After two days in office Silva&apos;s Cabinet was also obliged to resign owing to disagreements on the subject of the strike and when the efforts of Senhor Castro to construct a new Ministry had ended in failure, Antonio Mario Baptista eventually succeeded in forming a new Government which is said to have the support of the majority in Parliament, the Press and the general public. The new Prime Ministers programme is for public order and cheaper food.It is clear that the Extremists have recently gained ground very rapidly in Portugal and the sympathy which the late Prime Minister is reported to have expressed for Bolshevik ideals is significant of the general trend of affairs. The late Government depended very largely upon the support of the Republican Guard, which has considerable political influence and stands for advanced Socialism ; it is said that Antonio M. Silva, who is President of the so-called Soviet of Officers of the Republican Guard, is in reality a kind of dictator a maker of Prime Ministers from behind the scenes, and this view is borne out by the fact that Silva himself has held the post of Prime Minister for a few days during the present crisis.Bolshevism is reported to be making great progress in the Portuguese Navy and active Bolshevik propaganda is being carried on in the south of Portugal by the Extremists Carvalho and Yieira. In the northern part of the country, where nearly everyone is a small landholder, Bolshevism is said to be unpopular. The Extremist newspapers the Gombate and the jBatdlha are engaged in publishing Bolshevik and anti-British propaganda.Turkey.-The Turkish Cabinet has resigned owing to its ^ffficufty in complying with the demands of jthe Entente and those of
the Nationalist Party under Mustapha Kemal; and a new Ministry, which is said to be almost entirely Nationalist in sympathy has been formed under Salih Pasha, ex-Miuister of Marine.Evidence is accumulating from all sides to prove that the connection between the promoters of the Pan-Islamic movement and the Bolsheviks is a very close one.   Mustapha Kemal appears to be working in close touch with the Soviet Government and his enimissaries are constantly at Moscow and Tashkent.  The Pan-Islamic leaders in Switzerland are reported early in January to have come to a definite&apos; agreement with the Bolsheviks based on the following terms: That Islam shall appoint a supreme religious head at Tashkent; that Mohammedans shall have complete liberty as regards religion, education and self-government; that Islam shall support all Bolshevik enterprises and be under the orders of Moscow for the purposes of propaganda and military action; that Islamic organizations shall endeavour to assist Bolshevik communication in Europe; and that the Bolsheviks shall not attempt to tamper with the laws of the Koran or to change the condition of Mohammedan women.   There can be little doubt that in Turkey the Nationalist leaders are pinning their faith on Soviet Russia for the realization of their cause.   They are reported to be ready to compel the Sultan to issue a proclamation to the people appealing to their patriotism and asking them to assist the Bolsheviks provided that the latter will guarantee the integrity of the Turkish Empire.   As an inducement to the Bolsheviks to come to i heir assistance the Young Turks are ready to assist them in their revolutionary propaganda in China, Persia and India.The Turkish Red Crescent Society and the Mouvahidin Society are already busily engaged in propaganda work. The latter has Egyptian and. Indian branches. The Indian branch is probably at Bonibay under the direction of a certain Khufshid Sezai Bey, who was sent from Turkey to arrange its organization. He recently informed the Central Organization of his society that he was about to visit Hyderabad in order to enlist the sympathies of the Nizam.In Europe the Pan-Islamic League has a committee in Berlin with branches in London and Paris. Political propaganda, however, is directed from Berlin; where the committee is divided into two sections, one dealing with matters immediately concerning Pan-Islamism and the Nationalist movement in Turkey, the other with Bolshevik and revolutionary matters.In Smyrna the Turkish Nationalists are working in dose touch with Mustapha Kernel and are strongly supported, it is said, by the Italians. The Nationalists in Smyrna are reported to be organizing a rising against the Greeks in conjunction with a Turkish attack on. the Greek fronts. The Greek authorities appear to be well informed with regard to the situation, and are perhaps inclined to exaggerate its seriousness. The exact object of the Italians in assisting the Nationalists at Smyrna is not quite clear at present, but, it is believed, that they hope to prevent the Greeks froiia getting Smyrna and to weaken England&apos;s supremacy in Egypt and Turkey by supporting the Pan-Islamic movement. Whatever their aims may be, they are undoubtedly spending a good deal of money. The Ybuhg Turks, according to a statement of the Italian Socialist leader,
Bombacei, are renewing their efforts to act in co-operation with the Socialist Party in Italy. The Party is undecided whether or not to accept these overtures, but an Italian Socialist deputy, Rombotti, has been persuaded by the Turkish Nationalists to go to the Caucasus to study the Pan-Islamic movement on the spot. The Italian Consul at Lausanne is stated to be an intermediary in the secret communications between the Young Turks in Asia Minor and their partisans in Switzerland. This correspondence passes by way of Smyrna and Italy and it is reported that a copy of a preliminary treaty made between Enver Pasha and the Bolsheviks was sent to Syria and Turkey for approval through this channel of communication.central asia. There is evidence of the existence of a Bolshevik organization at Baku which has a representative at Tashkent, and apparently receives funds from Astrakhan. An agreement exists between the Caucasians and the Young Turks, but at present no details with regard to the agreement are available. The Bolshevik representative in the Caucasus appears to be a certain Mikoian.From the Amir of Afghanistan&apos;s most recent explanation of his attitude towards Great Britain, it would appear that although he is not prepared to give any assurance that Afghanistan will not be used as a focus for Bolshevik intrigues against India, he has as yet concluded no definite agreement with the Soviet Government. Meanwhile it seems clear that the Bolsheviks have arrived at some form of agreement with Bokhara, the terms of which are said to include the acceptance of Bolshevik paper-money in exchange for grain, &amp;c, assistance by the Amir in the repair of the Kerki railway and free permission to Bolshevik subjects to enter Bokhara. Axchod, the official representative of the Moscow Government, is reported to have gained the confidence of the Amir. Kuropatkin, with other Bolshevik officials, recently paid a visit to Chardjui, where he publicly denounced the cruelties of former Bolsheviks and emphasised the importance of the reorganization of trade, He promised complete independence to Boidvara.Pertz, the head of the Petrograd German Worknien&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council, in the course of a recent conversation with Radek, stated that the Bolshevik policy in India was to stimulate agitation in favour of Indian independence and not to attempt to convert the people to Bolshevism. Pertz was of opinion that a political revolu-tion in India would benefit both the Bolsheviks and the German Communists because it would be a blow to British Imperialism.China. &quot; Alarmist&quot; reports, which have recently appeared in the Temps, the Times and the Daily Mail concerning the alleged danger of Bolshevism being favourably received in China, have aroused considerable interest in Pekin, where opinion is expressed that they are almost entirely without foundation. According to the views of intelligent Chinese, whatever designs the Bolsheviks may have on China, they must take into account Chinese natural and inherent capacity for moderation. In China there is no clear line of demarcation between employer and employee, no class hatred and no struggle between capital and labour; in fact, many of the conditions
prevailing in Western countries which provide fertile soil for sowing seeds of discontent do not exist.The administration of the country in favour of the Proletariat may be said to form the basis of Chinese rule, particularly as regards the agricultural classes, from whom the sustenance of the people and the main revenue of the Government are derived.The present dissatisfaction with the existing Government is due to mal-administration and not to the form of Government.Jamaica. Though the Government has wisely decided to institute a force of Special Constabulary in various centres on the island, the negroes are peaceable and contented. The large number of peasant proprietors will always have a stabilising influence in this colony. Owing to the very high profits now being made out of sugar, and the rise in the cost of living, it is quite likely that there will be demands for higher wages; in fact the process has already begun, for the Conciliation Board has settled the tramway dispute by granting a substantial increase to the motormen and conductors.Australia. It is interesting to note that the strike of marine engineers, which dislocated traffic for several months, collapsed in a week after the Government issued a decree placing an embargo on the strikers&apos; funds and prohibiting bankers from honouring trade union cheques. This application by Mr. Hughes of the Australian &quot; Dora&quot; is held by the labour leaders to have been unconstitutional, but Mr. Hughes claims that his action was necessary in the public interest, as the strike was disorganising the trade of the country.A clothing budget prepared by the workers has been submitted to the Basic Wage Commission appointed by the Commonwealth Govern-ment to fix a Federal minimum wage. The budget allows the sum of  61 14s. 6i  per annum for the clothes of a husband and wife.Employees of the Melbourne building trade have decided for the future to work only forty hours a week.&quot;New Zealand. Politics in New Zealand, as well as the social outlook, are tending to become, as in other countries, a dual between Labour and Capital. Unrest is the characteristic of the time; the cost of living and the shortage of houses chafe the populace. As in England the war has benefited many and impoverished others and an appearance of prosperity leading to considerable spending is to be observed. A marked tendency prevails to prefer city to agricultural employment, and a shortage of pioneer labour for the construction of roads and railways is likely to hamper the develop-ment of New Zealand.As usual the salaried middle class is heavily pressed by the high prices and it is possible that the Labour Party would have had an increase to its strength at the General Election, possibly leading to an accession to office, had it not been for the fact that it is identified with the doctrines of a small band of Extremists. As it is Labour did remarkably well (see January Eeport) and in the present Parliament official Labour holds eight seats and Independent Labour three.
The strike of miners in New Zealand, which had lasted for five and a half months, was settled early last month hy a conference between the miners and the owners which was summoned by the Prime Minister. The Conference came to an agreement in ten days.Canada. It is reported that Labour in Canada seems to be moving to the Left more rapidly than is the case in the United States of America.   It is alleged that British agitators from the Clyde and Tyneside are in control of the most formidible radical groups, and that, although the I.W.W. is not popular, the Ona Big Union is making certain headway in the Western States.   Winnipeg reports claim that the One Big Union is gaining support at the expense of the International.   The British Columbia, Federationalist, hitherto a moderate labour newspaper, has recently become the organ of the Union, and the British Columbia Federation of Labour, which used to be affiliated to the American Federation of Labour, has now officially severed its connection with that body and accepted the One Big Union programme.   The Alberta miners and the coal miners in Nova Scotia have also seceded from the American Federation of Labour.   In the Eastern provinces of Canada, however, the One Big Union has not gained so much ground, and the labour movement generally in that part of the country appears to have been steadied and to have acquired a certain sense of responsibility since the accession to power of the Farmer-Labour Government in Ontario. The Ontario Government has declared for an increase in the death duties, and has already established mothers&apos; pensions and minimum wages for women and children and abolished property qualifications for municipal offices.After a hearing lasting fifteen days, F. J. Dixon, member of the Manitoba Legislature and one of the Winnipeg strike leaders, was acquitted on the charge of seditious libel. In view of this verdict similar proceedings against the Rev. J. S. Woodsworth were abandoned. The Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council recently rejected by an overwhelming majority the One Big Union proposal for a general strike as a protest against the sentence on Russell. Jack Kavanagh, organizer of the Canadian One Big Union, is in England to collect funds for the defence of the leaders of the movement who have been sentenced for their share in the Winnipeg strike.South Africa.-It is probable that the Government (the South African Party) will lose a good many seats at the General Election both to the Nationalist Party and the Labour Party. Both these parties stand for a complete secession from the British Empire. It is hoped, however, that the Government and the Unionists between them will secure a working majority in the new Parliament.The industrial unrest caused by a further rise in the cost of living is causing much suffering on the Rand; the working classes are continuing to demand higher wages, and there have been several strikes. The recent strike of the native miners at Johannesburg is attributed to well organized propaganda work by the International Socialists ; it was stigmatised by General Smuts as a &quot; dangerous&quot; movement, and he took occasion to point out some of the troubles
which would arise in South Africa should &quot; the nonsense that hasbeen talked about republics of blood and tears.....be put intopractice by the natives.&quot;United States of America.-It is thought that the decision of the Secretary of Labour that its affiliation with the Third Inter-national brings the Communist Party within the legal definition of a revolutionary body will enable the Government to order the depor-tation of many of the extreme Socialists, who have now re-named themselves Communists. The authorities who continue their raids on the Reds claim to have recently arrested in Paterson, New Jersey, some of the most dangerous &quot;constructive&quot; Anarchists, but it appears that the most important captures have been made in Chicago where at least thirty of the leaders of the I.W.W. have been arrested and the official records of the Society in the Eastern States have been seized.   It is estimated that about three-fourths of the 5,000 Extremists whose arrest was reported last month (see United States of America, Report 16) were Russians, but Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, Chinese, Finns, Lithuanians and Letts were also included among the prisoners.  It is believed that it will be possible to deport between 3,000 and 4,000 of them.   There is no doubt that the Communist Party has suffered heavily as a result of the measures of suppression adopted by the authorities, but the Communist Labour Party which has fewer alien members has escaped more lightly. The natural tendency of the more educated revolutionaries is to lie low and to endeavour to disguise their revolutionary objects until the present &quot; persecution &quot; dies down.  The leaders of the Communist Labour Party have changed the name of their association to the American Economic and Literary Society.  The German branches are ostensibly converting themselves into benevolent organizations, and the Russian branch is carrying on its existence under the disguise of tea rooms.   Other branches propose for the time being to become musical or literary societies.  The Union of Russian Workers, which has probably suffered more than any other Extremist Society, has also taken to carrying on its work in secret.   On the whole, the strong action employed by the authorities is supported in the press and by public opinion, although the deportation of Russians is some-times criticised on the ground that the return of the undesirables to their native country will enable them to carry on their propaganda without any restraint.Interest in the trial of the suspended members of the Assembly of New York State (see United States of America, Report 16) remains unabated and public opinion seems to be against the action taken by the Assembly. The conduct of the trial has been arbitrary and has probably done somethiug to restore the declining prestige of the Socialist Party.In his examination before the Senate Sub-Committee Martens gave some interesting particulars of the means by which he has received funds from Moscow. He claims that out of twenty messengers sent to him during the past year seven have reached him bringing with them 150,000 dollars. Of the messengers who failed to arrive several were shot in Finland and nine were imprisoned in Germany.  Marten&apos;s position is said still to be insecure, but his
-backers have been strengthened since the failure of the White forces in Russia, and the desire of American firms to trade with Russia is also in his favour.   He states that ninety-four firms are now on his books.  Dudley Malone is also working energetically to promote the reopening of trade between the United States of America and Russia. Meetings to discuss the subject have been held in Washington and New York, and an American Commercial Association has been formed to promote Russian trade. The fear lest the British, whom a speaker at one of the Washington meetings described as &quot; a people who have the ability to look stupid and still be very clever,&quot; should capture the Russian market has undoubtedly influenced American business men. They fully realise that the opening up of trade with the Russians must carry with it a recognition of the Soviet Republic.   Dudley Malone, who was vice-president of these meetings, made no attempt to disguise this fact.   He admitted quite frankly that &quot;All this co-operative talk was sheer nonsense, for the Co-operatives could not make or enforce a contract as business in Russia could only be done with the Russian Soviet Government.&quot;   On the 10th of March it was reported in Washington that President Wilson had decided to remove all restrictions on trade with the Russian Co-operatives or individuals, while at the same time he refused to recognize the Soviet Government.   Officials of the State Department have notdenied this report.The American railways reverted to private ownership on the 1st of March, and it is too early to predict how the change will be accepted. There is no doubt, however, that the railway question has provoked something in the nature of a crisis for Organized Labour. Mr. Gompers still resists the entry of labour into the political arena by means of the National Labour Party as &quot; detrimental to the interests of Labour and exactly in line with that which is most ardently desired by those who are seeking to oppress labour.&quot; He is opposed by Stone, one of the leaders of the Railroad Brotherhoods, who stands for the nationalisation of the railways and of other key industries and who supports the Independent Labour Party. A struggle between these two men for the leadership of organized labour may be anticipated.The intentions of the Communist Party and the Communist Labour Party to organize a rebellion of the negro population in support of the contemplated social revolution have been amply proved by evidence obtained during the recent raids, [t is stated that Martens advanced considerable sums for this purpose, and that Malone, Dolgih, A. C. Wagenknecht and a Mrs, Richardson were the Communists most prominent in the work of propaganda. Plans are being formed to effect a union between the Russian Jews and the negroes. Russian Jews disguised as pedlars have been discovered engaged in propaganda work among the black population in Texas, and it is reported that a negro rising in Arkansas was only averted by the timely arrival of troops. The death sentences passed on twelve negroes convicted of murders in the previous Arkansas rioting are being utilized for the purposes of propaganda by various coloured organizations, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People being especially prominent in its efforts to secure the release of these murderers.
South America.Argentina. The strike of the stevedores at Rosario and a boycott which is being enforced by the Seamen&apos;s Federation against the Mihanovich Company at Buenos Aires have adversely affected shipping during the last few weeks.German immigrants are reaching the Argentine to the extent of from 500 to 700 on each Dutch mail boat which arrives; it is reported that they are provided with capital and are settling in the southern provinces on land which is controlled by the promoters of the German Colonisation Scheme.Panama. It is reported that 17,000 coloured labourers on the Panama Canal have been on strike for a short time, but the latest information is that the Leaders have advised the men to return to work and the strike is broken. The Governor of the Panama Canal Zone recently prohibited a dance which was being promoted by &quot; The Friends of Irish Freedom&quot; on the ground that the entertainment was political, as the money obtained was to be devoted to furthering the cause of the &quot;Irish Republic.&quot;San Salvador. Trade Unionists in San Salvador are reported to have invited the Labour organizations of Latin American countries, including Mexico, to send delegates to a Conference in San Salvador for the discussion of Bolshevism and the progress of the Labour movement generally.Mexico. The new Mexican Communist Party (see Mexico, Report 16) hopes to receive shortly the direct recognition of the Third International, and in anticipation of this recognition the Bureau Latino-america of the Third International has been formed, while the old Socialist organ El Soviet is to be renamed El Communista Latino-america.  The conversion of the Socialists into Communists has greatly strengthened the position of Lynn A. E. Gale, who claims to have received through Martens the recognition of the Russian Soviet Government.   Two Bolshevik agents were recently arrested at Tampico by the military authorities.   One of those men, Jorge Welleski, had) been appointed by the Central Soviet Committee of Chicago &quot; Chief of the Socialist Propaganda in Mexico,&quot; while the other, Jorge Rens-Kelli, was a Radical deportee from the United States of America.  Meanwhile Pismer who, it is stated, is an agent from the Russian Soviet Government, together with forty other Russians, is reported to have landed at Salina Cruz from a Japanese ship.   Pismer travelled to Mexico City and was received by the Secretary of Foreign Relations.The local Socialist Party of Mexico City refused to adopt the new name of Communist Party or the Communist programme, and this has occasioned a split among the Extremists in the city and the adjoining district.The I.W.W., with the assistance of Lynn A. E. Gale, is endeavour-ing to supplant the American Federation of Labour in the organisation of the Mexican working classes. The principal I.W.W. propagandists, in addition to Gale, are John A. Jutt, a German by
sobirth, and by trade a truckman, Jose Villalobos, an electrician, and Angel Barnal, a railwayman. With the assistance of a few Mexican intellectuals, these men are endeavouring to introduce into Mexico the methods of I.W.W. agitation familiar in the United States of America ; so far the Mexican Government has taken no action against their agitation.Fiji Islands, During the recent strikes of Indian workmen at Rewa and Suva (see February Report 16) there was but little rioting, and the rioters were dispersed by the military without resort to firing. The natives assured the Government that the strikes were designed to draw attention to the cost of living in relation to the rates of pay, and the Governor promised a commission of inquiry with the Chief Justice as Chairman. Wage-earning Indians will be repersenled on this commission.Persia. The capture of Krasnavodsk on the Caspian Sea has greatly increased Bolshevik&apos; prestige in Persia. It does not appear at present to be the intention of the Soviet Government to use armed force in Persia, although the Bolsheviks are reported to be strengthening their troops on the frontier, and a force of 15,000 to 20,000 Persian Extremists, under the leadership of the Turkish General, Khalil, is said to be under training for use against Khorasan. The Bolsheviks probably hope to further their cause in Persia by means of their propaganda before they attempt any invasion of the country. Their agents are working energetically, especially in Northern Persia, where fifty propagandists have recently been sent, in order to prepare the people for the intervention of the Red Army. Branches of the Persian Bolshevik Society (Adalet), have been established throughout Persia, and are said to be attracting a mass of new supporters.The Persian Nationalists in Switzerland are maintaining relations with the Pan-Islamic leaders in Turkey through the intermediary of a firm of Swiss watch makers which has an office at Constantinople. It has recently been noticed that attempts at a rapprochement are being made between the Persian and Egyptian Nationalists in Switzerland; at a meeting held at Geneva on the 8th of February Ali Akbar Khan, a Persian, and Ismael Kamel, an Egyptian Nationalist, were both present.Singapore. Considerable unrest exists among the Chinese artisan class. This is largely clue to economic causes, but the agitation is fostered by certain disaffected persons who have recently arrived from China.Egypt. There appear to be some slight grounds for hoping that the Nationalists in Egypt may discuss the situation with the Milner Commission before it returns to England, in spite of the recalcitrance of Zaghloul and his party in Paris.At the present time the moderate and intelligent Nationalists have as their object an alliance with the British under which the Egyptians would be on a complete equality with the British officials whose assistance they might need, and which would give to the Egyptians the power of final decision, in their own affairs,
They claim that Egypt of to-day is a very different country to the Egypt of 1882, and is now intellectually and politically well equipped for the control of her own Government.There is a fairly general opinion among the Nationalists and in fact among most Egyptians that the present Sultan was selected by the British because they considered that he would be a mere tool in their hands. The Sultan was never popular and it is considered by many that a great mistake was made in not choosing the son of Khedive Abbas II. Such a choice, it is said, would have made a great impression for good throughout the country. The present Sultan is accused of having no knowledge of Egypt, of being a mere mondahi and only a nominal Mussulman, and it is very doubtful whether the Egyptians would submit to his rule in the event of the concession of anything like independence.The ill-advised attacks by Sir William Willcocks and Colonel Kennedy on the new Nile projects (see Report 16, Part II) are bearing fruit. The whole country is now firmly impressed with the idea that England is trying to ruin Egyptian agriculture and to benefit Manchester by turning the Nile waters into the Sudan in order to raise rival cotton crops. There is no doubt that Sir Sirrey Pasha&apos;s (Minister for Public Works) resignation was indirectly due to the agitation and hostility which the Willcock&apos;s pamphlets have directed against his department. Shortly after the commencement of these attacks, Sir Sirrey Pasha asked that Colonel Kennedy should be deported, as the propaganda he was carrying on was a danger to the Governments authority; but the Residency would not do this, nor were any effective measures taken to suppress these attacks. The attempt on Sir Sirrey Pasha&apos;s life and the possibility of future attempts affected his nerve and hastened his resignation.For the moment there is an acute sense of uneasiness and men most familiar with the country and the people are showing anxiety. Prices are rising; food is expensive and scarce. This is in part due to the high price of cotton which has caused large areas usually sown with corn to be sown with cotton.It is felt that only some definite statement of the new form of Government will alleviate the present unrest.It may safely be said that no part of the Egyptian community owes more to the British Administration than the Fellaheen, and yet they are not satisfied.The Fellah always has a grievance, and in the days of Ismail and the OorvSe there was good cause for it.To-day, in spite of the law which regulates the sub-letting of land, many Feddans are rented by the Fellaheen at exorbitant prices, small parcels being let and sublet; thus an acre originally let at  2 is finally sublet to a peasant at  8.The trouble became acute when the Government fixed the price of corn.The result was (and is) that the Government contractors refused to sell at tariff price, and consequently the Government Departments, bent on purchasing corn at the price they had fixed, called in the Mamours to their assistance who undertook to supply the amount required, each district providing its quota.  The Mamours passed on
to the Omdehs the duty of collecting the necessary amount; the Omclehs put the burden of producing the corn on to the Fellaheen, who are rackrented, and not on the bigger farmers, who pay a normal rent. This will be remedied, but in the meantime the Fellaheen have a grievance, though they bear it with a certain stolid philosophy.The enquiry held after the murder of Pope Bey and other Englishmen showed the Fellah or rather the female Fellah in a new light. One day a young Fellah of youthful appearance came to give evidence before the Court of Enquiry, and mentioned the names of several villagers as being implicated in the crimes. Further enquiry disclosed the fact that this witness was a woman dressed as a man. As a child she refused to dress as a girl, and in spite of the attempts of her parents to prevent it, disguised herself as a boy and soon became the leader of a band of young ruffians who looted and plundered in the district with apparent impunity. What part this band played in the March rising is obscure; but when the people were told by their leaders who had come down from Cairo that the English had gone and .that there was no Government, it is believed that this gang was among the most active of the rioters.The Italian Socialists at Milan are said to have assisted the Egyptian Nationalists in the purchase of arms and ammunition in Italy and in their despatch to Egypt. An Egyptian Press Bureau has been established at Naples for the purpose of keeping Europe well informed with regard to the Nationalist movement. This Bureau is reported to be working in close touch with the Managing Committee of the Egyptian Nationalists in Berlin, and is under the direction of Ahmed Rifat.Syria. A new National Syrian Party has been formed at Damascus to support the Emir Feisul. The party&apos;s political programme includes the independence o( the Syrian Arabs, the promotion of learning, equal political and civil rights for all, the upholding of the principle of democratic monarchy by means of the creation of a parliamentary form of government under the Emir Feisul, the improvement of social conditions by the institution of co-operative societies and agricultural syndicates and the creation of an army to support the Emir. A report from Holland states that the Russian Soviet Government has sent agents to Syria in order to incite resistance to the French, and other reports state that the Arabs are threatening to enlist the support of the Bolsheviks if their independence is not recognized. Meanwhile the French are encouraging Moors to go to Syria to carry out French propaganda. The French are also reported to be endeavouring to take advantage of the present unrest in Egypt in order to discredit British methods of government in the eyes of the Mohammedans.British Hon.duras.-The Government has decided to increase taxation in the Colony; this decision is said to be necessary owing to the damage, estimated at  26,000, done during the riot last year, and the expenses, estimated at  2,000, incurred owing to the enforce-ment of martial law on that occasion.
paet II.conference of the third international at amsterdam.A Conference to inaugurate the opening of the Bureau in Holland for furthering the doctrines of the Third International (see Holland, Eeport 16), has been held at Amsterdam. It began on the 3rd and lasted until the 10th of Eebruary, its proceedings being somewhat interrupted and harassed by the attentions of the Dutch Police.The following delegates of the Extremists were present: Holland ... ... Poland Hoist, Wynkoop, vonLeuven, Pannekoek, Gorter.Dutch Indies    ...        ... De Fessa.Belgium ... ... Van Ober-Straeten.Germany ... ... Stuka.United States of America ... Louis  Praina,   and , JacobNosovitszky.Great Britain    ... ... Sylvia    Pankhurst,   Willis,Murphy, Hodgson. China ... ... ... Dr. Qua.Soviet Eussia   ...        ... S. J. Eutgers.The proceedings of the Conference began with the usual bickerings between the delegates, Willis, the representative of the British Socialist Party, raising objections to the presence of Nosovitszky at the Con-ference, whose intrigues, he stated, had caused considerable friction between Sylvia Pankhurst and the Soviet Eepublic. After consider-able discussion the Conference overruled Willis&apos;s objections to Nosovitszky. Eutgers left Eussia with the mandate to organize the Third International Bureau in Holland. He was given a large quantity of pearls and diamonds for the purpose of revolutionary propaganda. He is said to have left many of these jewels in Germany with reich and Broncke. To his surprise these comrades have kept them, and it is reported that they have sold them for 4,000,000 marks in Germany. It is considered that this action was due to the opposition of the West European Communist Secretariat to the establishment of the new Bureau. Eutgers then announced that he had been entrusted by the Eussian leaders to start the Bureau of the Third International in Holland. He stated that the Western European Secretariat of the Communist International had spent millions of marks for revolutionary propaganda in Germany without any visible results, and that it had now been determined to concentrate revolutionary activities in England and France. He admitted that the authorities in Moscow had been mistaken and that it was amply proved that a social revolu-tion in Germany was out of the question at the present time. In England and France, however, he considered that the people were ripe for revolution and that it was the task of the new Bureau to assist them. Sylvia Pankhurst made a violent attack against those comrades who still believed that the raising of the blockade and the re-establishment of trade relations with Europe would benefit Soviet Eussia. The only hope of assisting the Bolsheviks, in her opinion, lay in fostering the revolutionary spirit in th3 proletariat of Great Britain.  She advocated the proclamation by the Bureau of a General
Strike. &quot; Three months is the limit for a general strike and when the general strike is declared there is only one step to revolution.&quot;Nosovitszky seems to have thrown cold water upon the General Strike proposition. His arguments convinced the Conference and Sylvia Pankhursfs proposal for the proclamation of a General Strike was rejected. The following resolution with regard to Soviet Russia was then carried: &quot;A revolutionary action of the workers to force International Capital to make peace with Russia is a necessary condition to save Soviet Russia and to hasten the world revolution.&quot; To further this action the Communists of all lands must utilize every strike movement, every mass demonstration:&quot; 1st. To place this aspect of their responsibilities to the russian revolution before the workers; &quot; 2nd. To convince them that their interests are identical withthose of Soviet Russia; &quot; 3rd. To develop a strong feeling of revolutionary solidarity andre-action the world o ver.&quot;It was strongly emphasised that the appeals to the workers for international strike action must not be made exclusively through the bureaucracy of the Trade Unions, but must be urged upon the masses of workers in the Unions by outside agencies, the creation of which was advocated. A suggestion to add to the resolution a clause urging the workers in other countries not to oppose a possible attack by the Bolshevik Army was opposed by Rutgers, who urged that the adoption of such a resolution by the Conference would confirm the Capitalist statement that Soviet Russia was becoming an aggressive force.The Conference decided that the delegates upon their return to their respective countries should embark energetically upon revolu-tionary propaganda and that all strikes and industrial disputes of whatever character must be assisted and fostered as much as possible by the Bureau. Wynkoop, who was elected permanent chairman of the Conference, in a short speech declared that, in order not to let England crush the Russian, German, or any other revolution, it was of vital importance to create a strong revolutionary movement in England, and he advocated that the Bureau should give its moral and financial support to the Shop Stewards&apos; movement in England because it bore &quot; a strong Soviet character.&quot; The Conference then discussed the questions of the nationalisation and control of industry the details of revolutionary propaganda and the formation of the Red Army, the methods for uniting the various Extremists in the different countries into the Communist Party, and the details of the organization of the International Bureau.The relations between the Communist Party and Trade Unionism were hotly discussed. It was decided that the Communist policy must he to create within the Labour movement little Communist groups whose duty it must be to wean the affections of the workers from the domination of the reactionary Trade Unionist leaders. The British delegates took a prominent part in this discussion, and Murphy, as a representative of the Shop Stewards&apos; movement, stated that the majority of the younger workers were filled with a
revolutionary spirit against their reactionary leaders. He considered that if the Shop Stewards&apos; movement obtained the support of the Bureau, it might become one of the greatest factors in the revolu-tionary movement in England. It was decided that a Communist Party must be formed in England as soon as possible, but the British representatives were pessimistic as to the chances of effecting a union between the British Socialist Party, the British Socialist Labour Party, the Workers Socialist Federation and the South Wales Socialist Party. The Conference made arrangements for the publication of literary propaganda in every language and for the despatch of agents all over the world; and Wynkoop announced that a sub-bureau has already been established in Spain and that a sub-bureau would be set up in the United States of America.The Bureau at Amsterdam will consist of three permanent members who were appointed by the Conference Rutgers, Roland Hoist and Wynkoop. Representatives of other countries and organizations affiliated to the Third International will also send delegates to work in the Bureau.Soviet Russia: The Co-operative Societies.Before the war the co-operatives in Russia were few and &quot; local,&quot; some of them being mere &quot;artels&quot; or combinations of a rather primitive type between small groups of peasants for mutual aid. In 1898 the turnover of those small consumers&apos; co-operatives, all working on a very modest basis, amounted to no more than 31,000 roubles ; but by 1914 it had swollen to 10,000,000 roubles.In spite of hindrances put in their way by the Government during the war these co-operatives grew and prospered under the influence of the high cost of living, so that when the Revolution broke out there was hardly a corner of the Empire in which some kind of co-operative was not active. The isolation of Siberia had always encouraged co-operation and during the first two years of the war the co-operatives practically doubled in that country.These co-operative branches were not uniform, having been formed without any special plan and for the most part quite spontaneously. In the provinces the prevailing type of society was the small con-sumers and loan credit society of modest means. As time went on the tendency was to amalgamate Societies and to increase their size. Thus even under the old regime there came into being the &quot; Moscow Association of Consumers&apos; Societies&quot; which was called &quot; The Society&quot; and had members by tens of thousands. A similar Organization is the big Russian &quot; Central Co-operative Bank,&quot; called the &quot; Moskowsky Narodny &quot; Bank, with branches all over the Empire. After the Revolution the co-operative movement made great headway, and in 1917, under the guidance of the Liberal parties and Right Wing Socialists, their turn-over amounted to 200,000,000 roubles, and the number of societies is said to have been some 80,000.Foreign trade accounted for this increase only in a limited degree. Einkcbufs-centmle or purchase centres for this purpose had been set up during the war and an office of the Russian co-operative associations and branch of the &quot; Moskowsky Narodny &quot; Bank had been formed in
London. But the one really important commercial success before the war in respect of imports was the Siberian Butter Association of Co-operatives which in 1913 produced for export 4  million poods of butter at 12 roubles per pood.Indeed as far as foreign trade was concerned the Co-operatives of European Russia lagged behind, and it was not until the war that the movement attained commercial importance in the larger sense. This came with the founding at Moscow of the Association called the Zentro-Sojus which during the war supplied the armies and started numerous factories and workshops, and now, within the narrow limits in which it is a free agent, controls practically all the industrial, as opposed to the food supply, Co-operatives in Russia.At first the Soviet Government left the Co-operatives untouched. Later on they took increasingly drastic measures to incorporate them into the communistic form of economy.For a time, after all private banks had been nationalised and declared to be branches of the Russian National Bank in Moscow, the famous Moscow People&apos;s Bank retained its full rights and even received express authority to continue unhampered the conduct of its business within the limits of its original charter.As a result it prospered exceedingly, and in 1918 its balance sheet for the first half year is reported to have shown fautastic figures.The Zentro-Sojus also for a time remained untouched after the entire private industry of the country had been socialised.It did not escape the Soviet Government, however, that these Co-operative Societies had, with their increased prosperity, come to resemble a State within a State. Sharper measures were accordingly taken to incorporate them in the Communistic scheme. Thus two decrees were issued by. the Government in April 1918 and March 1919 to annul the comparatively independent position of these Societies and to increase their subjection to the Bolshevik Central Economic Council in Moscow.There are at present two kinds of Co-operative Organizations in Soviet Russia: 1. Food supply organizations: wholly monopolized by the Government and represented by the Users Commune.2. Organizations of industry other than food supply largely consisting of peasant industries: retaining a shadow of independence, and represented by the Zentro-Sojus.All food supply co-operatives are incorporated under the Users&apos; Commune, which is run by the Central Committee and directing District Committees in towns and Communes, represented on the Central Committee. The latter has the character of a purely Government institution. All the Government food supply organiza-tioiis are also included in the Users&apos; Commune, so that the whole of the food supply of the country is in its hands. Co-operative Societies, as such, have therefore now nothing to do with food supplies, which are both theoretically and in fact a Government monopoly.The second category of Co-operative Societies as incorporated in the Zentro-Sojus includes all those of a productive nature.
Owing to the wretched condition of affairs in Russia the Soviet Government has felt it politic to observe a certain restraint in dealing with Co-operatives of this kind, and it is probable that the more moderate party in the Soviet may have its way in the matter and that for the time being no further direct measures will be taken against the Zentro-Sojus.Even so, however, the Government can to a great extent squeeze the Zentro-Sojus without going so far as to impose force upon it. For the Societies are, in consequence of the deplorable industrial situa-tion, only in a position to conduct their business with the assistance of the Government. The bad state of transport and shipping makes it almost impossible for them to work, except under control of the Supreme Economic Council in Moscow, which controls all traffic.Under all the circumstances one is not astonished by the reports which state that the output of these associations is diminishing and that the vitality and productiveness of the Co-operatives is said to be on the decrease.The increasing discouragement of personal interest and initiative, the sense on the part of members of Co-operative Societies that individual effort is likely to go unrewarded, have had their inevitable effect on production. The restrictions on certain categories of persons as regards the Societies, and the general negation of the law of supply and demand have, temporarily at least, sapped their vitality. The most interesting decree from this point of view is that of the Commissariat of National Economy, dated the 24th of September, 1919 (No. 129, Izvestia Vserossiskavo Ispolnitelnavo Komityeia), limiting the right of the following categories of persons to take part not only as Directors but even as members in Co-operative Societies: 1. Persons owning fifty or more desiatins of land, a house, or equivalent immovable property. 2. Persons   possessing   trade or   manufacturing   institutionsemploying twenty or more people. 3. Persons formerly owning shares. 4. Civil grades from grade (I) to grade (Y). 5. Military grades from Colonel upwards. 6. Employees receiving salary from grade 20 and higher.Should these restrictions continue and the tenets of the Communists continue to, be imposed upon the activities of these Societies the outlook for the Russian Co-operatives would be very black. In fact, were it not for the peculiar vitality of the Russian people, the feeling for individual property among them, which no theories, however persuasively stated and forcibly imposed, will be able to uproot, it might be described as hopeless. It is interesting to note the opinion on this point of the German Economic Mission recently sent to Russia. That Mission had no doubt that co-operative tendencies could not be wiped out among the Russian people. Though the Bolsheviks had tried in every way to replace the leaders of the Co-operatives with their own pi^oiegtIs, and the head of the Board of the Zentro-Sojus is a Bolshevik, the Co-operatives themselves were reported to remain in extreme opposition to Bolshevism.   It is
moreover, true that there is a great difference between the rigid degrees of a council of national economy and the kindlier practice of the subordinate officials who are called upon to apply them and who find them impossible to apply as they stand. But this does not alter the fact that the main effort of a highly centralised and powerful Government is directed along lines which can only lead to the stifling of the industrial and commercial activities of the Societies.In any case, at present and in the near future, there can be no question of serious foreign trade in Soviet Russia, not only because of the general and quite definite mistrust of the Government on the part of the people, but chiefly on the ground of the almost complete state of ruin of the transport which absolutely excludes the possibility of carrying any large: quantities of goods. As things stand only certain small kinds of goods light in weight can be transported. The most indispensable of these are said to be (in order of necessity) (1) vegetable seeds; (2) medical equipment; (3) needles and thread; (4) fitters&apos; and carpentering goods.The immediate prospects of trade with the Co-operatives would therefore not seem to be bright. As regards foodstuffs, they are in the hands of the Consumers&apos; Union, a Government monopoly. As regards produce other than food supply, the Zentro-Sojus has till quite recently been becoming more and more immcshed in regulations and restrictions dictated by Communist theorists and destructive of freedom of commerce. In neither case can dealing with the Co-operatives for the present be considered otherwise than as dealing with the Soviet Government. While, governing all, there is the breakdown of transport, which neither the Co-operatives, in so far as they have freedom left, nor the Soviet Government have power to improve for many months to come.military juntas in spain.The Military Juntas which are now so powerful in Spain that some competent authorities consider that they are to-day the deciding factor in Spanish politics, have been in existence for some consider-able time. At first these Societies concerned themselves only with the general welfare of the officers in the different branches of the service which they represented, and many of their demands, which were made by them with the object of improving the conditions of service and suppressing the abuses and jobbery prevalent in the army, were perfectly legitimate. Towards the end of 19 L6, however, they for the first time adopted a united front and became to all intents and purposes a Military Trade Union which arrogated to itself a power in the State which was incompatible with constitutional Government. As soon as it became apparent that the Juntas were beginning to exercise a political influence, orders were issued by the Government of the day for their suppression, and for a short time they ceased to play any part in politics. They were, however, speedily reformed and since that time have been instrumental in bringing about the fall of several of the recent administrations in Spain.The attempt made by Signor La Cierva, Minister of War in Garcia Prieto&apos;s cabinet which succeeded that of Signor Dato last October, to get rid of the military tyranny by granting increases of
pay to the officers in the Army on the understanding that the Juntas would no longer interfere in politics, appears to have ended in failure. The Juntas de Defensa, as they were called, certainly ceased do exist, but the Juntas Tecnicas, or Comisiones, which have succeeded them still exercise an important political influence, the results of which it is impossible to forecast. The attitude of the Juntas was at one time directly threatening to the monarchy and it has even been suggested that they have acted in collusion with the Republican Party. At the present time, however, they appear to be willing to support the King provided that he makes no attempt to suppress their powers, and they are said to stand for a consti-tutional monarchy. They exercise their power in various ways, but mainly by intimidating politicians and by means of campaigns in the press directed against Ministers who have incurred their displeasure.In view of the example set them by their officers it is not surprising to find that the non-commissioned officers have also endeavoured to form Juntas. This sincere form of flattery which, it is rumoured, had the support of certain Generals who hoped in this way to counteract the powers of the Juntas de Defensa which hampered the policy of the Higher Command, has up to the present time been checked by the officers&apos; Juntas. It is clear, however, that the mania for forming Juntas is now prevalent in Spain, as various sections of Government servants, notably the postal and telegraph employees, have already attempted to form these societies and sometimes their efforts seem to have been successful.Note from a Spanish Correspondent.In Spain the industrial classes belong either to the Workers&apos; General Union, which is a Socialist organization, or to the Workers&apos; National Federation, which professes the doctrines of Syndicalism. The latter organization, which is in touch with the French Confederation G-4ne&quot;rale du Travail, appears to be almost entirely confined to Catalonia and has its headquarters at Barcelona.The Spanish Socialists are in favour of Parliamentary methods, but the Syndicalists repudiate any form of constitutional action and endeavour to effect their objects by means of strikes and the provo-cation of social unrest. A pronounced revolutionary spirit did not become apparent in the industrial world until the advent of Bolshevism in Russia. It would be an exaggeration, however, to say that the whole Bolshevik creed has been accepted by the bulk of the Spanish workmen, although there is little .doubt that Bolshevik influences are at work among them. The socialisation of all industry and the general distribution of private property form part of the gospel of both Socialists and Syndicalists, but this does not necessarily carry with it the claim of the Bolsheviks to attain these aims by resort to violent measures and it is,not anticipated that such is the intention of the vast majority of the working classes in Spain. Spanish agricultural labourers have been affected to a varying extent by the propaganda of the Extremists, but it is only in the provinces of Andalusia and Estrenvadura that it can be said that the present conditions constitute anything approaching a social problem,
His Majesties Stationbbt OffjobThere appears to be a certain amount of unrest in these provinces on the large estates. Until recently the wages of agricultural labourers used to be very low, but they have how been increased considerably, although it is stated that this rise has not been due to any advance in agricultural prices, but to the direct action of the labourers, who evinced their discontent by setting fire to crops, &amp;c. This form of agitation, however, took place before the doctrines of Bolshevism came into existence, and, so long as the Church retains its influence in Spain, it is unlikely that any general revolutionary activity will take place in the country districts. In this connection, it is interesting to note that the Catholic Agricultural Society is reported to be obtaining good results and to have a great number of members.
