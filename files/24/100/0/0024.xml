(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.C A B I N E T.C * P *824MINISTRY OF SUPPLY AND   WORKS,MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST COMiMISSLONER OP W0R&quot;*S,1.     I have been asked to,consider, in consultation with the Minister of Supplies, the question of the creation of &apos;a new Ministry which woucLd combine the present functions of the Office of p,orks and the Ministry of Munitions.   The difficulty of this question is that there appears to be at present no basis for agreement as to what functions the Ministry of Supplies is to carry out. -        If it is the -intention that the Ministry of Supplies shall continue to carry out all the functions of the Ministry of Munitions, including not merely the purchase of ordnance and other military stores as well as civilian stores, &quot;but also the management of Government Arsenals like the r&apos;ooIwich Explosive rorks, etc., it is evident that the problem to be worked out is of a very different character than if the Supplies are to be curtailed to the lists of relatively unimportant detailed matters which have been circulated by the far Office and the Admiralty.2a     As - far as the Office of v&apos;orks is concerned, there are a number of functions which It carries out of a rather particular character, such as the control and the care of the amenities of the Royal Parks, the upkeep of the Royal Palaces, the equipment and furnishing of Embassies, the determination and approval of Monuments and their sites, the custody and restoration of Ancient Monuments in Oreat Britain, and other duties of a similar character which fall
to some extent into the category-of a Ministry-af Fine Arts, which of course, does not exist.      This work, although perhaps not to be regarded as of the highest importance, requires very minute examination and care, and could not be handed over to a purely commercial Department generally interested in the economical purchase,,, of all kinds of stores.      Therefore in any case of re-organisationj it appears to me that the Office of forks will have to continue as a substantive Department. After careful consideration I think it would be possible for one Minister to control both the Office of forks and the Ministry of Supply, but this would undoubtedly entail the creation of a Parliamentary Secretaryship to the Office of Works, to whom the Minister.would have to delegate a considerable amount of. his authority.3.     The chief point of contact between the two sides of the new Ministry is the fact that, on the one hand, the Office of Works has in existence a very well organised and managed Supply Department which, during the Var, has proved its capacity for dealing&apos;in a businesslike and efficient manner with a very largely extended range and volume of work for other Departments; as well as itself.      This Supply Department has effected very  &apos;. considerable economies, which can be demonstrated, as for instance, in the provision of a large number of supplies for the War Office,4.     In the restricted lists of Supplies furnished by the ?!ar Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry there are only a small number of items which are not, at present, being supplied by the Supplies Division of my Department, and if these lists contain all that there-is to be supplied it would be a relatively small matter to develop my Supplies Department so as to beable
51     I would point out that in the memoranda of the War Departments which I have read through there are proposals regarding inspection of Supplies yjhich seem to me will lead to quite an unnecessary amount of duplication..     If any Department of Supply undertakes the responsibility for purchasing goods and supplying them on a specification, it must be supposed that it has a staff of inspectors capable of dealing with the work. The addition therefore, of other inspecting staffs specially appointed by the Fighting Departments must be superfluous if the former inspectors are doing their work properly*        I fail to see how economies are going to be effected by centralised purchasing if each of the separate V?ar Departments is  oing to keep a special inspectors staff to go round and inspect goods already inspected.        In fact, from my own practical experience I know that many large firms in this country do not tender for Government work at all, owing to the rigidity of the specification in the first place, and secondly, owing to the waste of time and the trouble involved by the minute and harrassing inspection which Government work entails.        I know, also, that a considerable amount of public money is wasted by the method of inspection adopted by various Departments in cases where, in ordinary business practice the goods would be received and only examined on delivery;   if they were then found defective, they naturally would be rejected.6.     On the general question I would like to make the following observations(a)*. 3 **
(a) There is no doubt that buying is an expert operation, but this is only true if your buyers are experts and not ordinary civil servants. I would like therefore to know whether it ia proposed to start the new Ministry cf  applies with real commercial experts and to pay them adequate salaries as they would receive outside in the commercial world.        In this respect I may mention that the Supplies Department of the Office of Forks is practically manned by technical experts,(b) Government Departments are very much restricted from taking advantage of market conditions both by the fact that they make their purchases by tender and also because they only buy within the limits of the estimates of the financial year.     The Government, therefore, cannot derive that advantage which expert buyers acting for commercial houses derive from their powers of negotiation.   &apos; Advantage, also cannot be taken by making long contracts or buying large quantities sometimes covering many years ahead.(c) Many economies have been effected by my Supplies Division owing to the intelligent alteration of specifications in consultation with manufacturera. If the new Ministry of Supply can have considerable i powers in this respect it would, I have no doubt, be able to-effect large economies, but if it is merely to act as a purchasing agent under specifications supplied by other Departments it will be able to achieve relatively little.7.     The elimination of competition between the various State Departments, while of the first importanceduring
during War time, is naturally less important in Peacetime, when the Government is relatively a small purchaser onthe home market, and is, therefore, in competition with allother purchasers of similar articles, both in the home trade and the export trade, but I think it is undeniable that some good results may be looked for by such eliminationo     One thing appears certain, and that is that unless the Departments for whom goods are bought are prepared to loyally and frankly accept the position, ho scheme, however good on paper, will work well in practice. I know from my own Departmental experience the difficulty of acting for other Departments as agents, and the not unnatural tendency for officers of the various Departments say, in the case of delays or other complaints, endeavouring to make the agent Department responsible in the matter. With the duty of purchasing stores, many of which would be of a technical character, presuming the memorandum of the Ministry of Munitions is accepted, the possibility of this kind of shelving of responsibility doubtless opens a very wide field, and is very difficult to combat.8.     Although I have devoted some time to the study of the organisation which it will be necessary to create if the proposed amalgamation of the Office of Fcrks and Stationery Office with the projeoteffiDepartmoirb of the Ministry of Supplies is to take place and have had several schemes drawn up, I have not thought it advisable to encumber this&apos; memorandum with detailed matters of this kind. When the main question of principle is once settled the question of organisation will require careful and detailed consideration.(Signed)      ALFRED MOND.OFFICE OF Y/ORXS,March 9th, 1920.m 15 **
