So far no official representations with regard to Reservation have been made to United States Government but in view of your ministers&apos; representations&apos;and objection of Australia and South Africa (see my Secret despatch 12th January) to second part of Reservation His Lajesty&apos;s Government are quito prepared to make clear to Government of United States of America that wo cannot accept reservation if and when the Reservation and Resolving Clause are actually adopted and before Ratification as contemplated in the latter.The fate of the Reservation and of the whole Treaty is appa*-rently still doubtful and it is worth consideration whether any public declaration now would not be used to consolidate -American opinion in support of the Policy expressed in the Reservation, His majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to have opinion of your Government on this point as if they are disposed to agree it would seem to be wiser to see whether Reservation is finally adopted and if so in what form before mailing a publio announce-ment as to our position.
