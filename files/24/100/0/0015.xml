4u-  - $r jgBIg^^ HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOtAntj^m)^g \SECRET..C * Po 815 fCC-r&quot;fTI^ Oil TEF^D^CONTROL OP FOOD.(Reference:   Cabinet-. Conference, February 3rd 1920, Minute 1 - C,P. 655)9 &apos;, FUTURE GANISATION FOOD NTROL,CEAIHEuW !&apos;S R?nORT.1* The Committee have considered the questionof the future of food control.     They are of opinion that so long as certain essential commodities are in short supply some form of control is required by public opinion and is necessary to prevent prices soaring, and to secure equitable distribution^     They believe that the continuance of the Food Ministry will serve as an emphatic reminder to the nation that the Government are armed with powers to prevent profiteering in foodo     On the other hand, they are awareoof the evils and anomalies arising from control and desire to terminate it as soon as possibles     They have, therefore,, come to the conclusion that a period $   of two years1 for the continuance of the Ministry of Food is preferable to the period of five years , proposed by the late Feed Controller, though it might prove to be the&apos; case that some form of control would still be necessary after the two years have - elapsed.The Committee were almost evenly divided between the desirability of a period of two or three years0Mr. Fisher, Mr. Chamberlain and Sir A. &apos; Boscawen wore in favour of two years.Lord Crawford was in favour of three years on; the merits, but recommend a period of two years to be inserted in the Bill on the ground that the House of Commons would pros3 for an extensionoMr. Munro and Mr. McCurdy were in favour of three years,,
The Committee, however, are of opinion that there would be no justification for a ,separate Ministry so soon as it became safe to abandon a regional administration..and: the---ratloning^ys1^e7Ti^ and that when that time arrives, it would be desirable to distribute the remaining,functions of the Ministry of Pood among other Departments *    Accordingly the Committee make the following recommendations(1)     A Bill to be introduced to continue the Ministry of Food for a period of two years from August 31st 1920, subject to a power taken in the Bill to terminate its existence at an earlier date by Order In Council*(2)   The tUheat Commission and the Sugar Commission to remain as at present constituted, but the existing powers of the Ministry cf Food to transfer to itself, in whole or in part, the duties and powers of the r&quot;hcat Commission and of the Sugar Commission, to be renewed*(3)   Provision to be made in the Bill for the transfer to other Departments by Order in Council of the remaining functions of the Ministry as soon as it is no longer necessary to retain the regional organisations,(4)    The Oils and Pats Department, the Meat and Livestock De-partment, and the Local Food Committees of the Ministry of Food to be dispensed with.The Brewing and Distilling Department to be transferred to the Liquor Commission proposed to be eat up in the Intoxicat-. ing Liquor (Regulation; Bill.The Milk Department to be transferred to the Ministry of Health, by such stages and at such time as may he agreed between the Ministry of Food and that Department,The,only remaining National Kitchen to be sold as a going concern^(5)    A suitable establishment for the work assigned to the Ministry of Food to be arranged between the Ministry and the Treasury,(6)     (a) The existing powers of the Ministry of Food to be renewed on the understanding that there viill be opportunity for their examination by the Home Affairs Committee before the. Bill is introduced in the House of Commons and that the Ministry&apos; of Food will make proposals for the restriction of such of its existing powers  is are wider than necessary,(b) In drafting the powers to br oxorcised by the Ministry of Food it should bo made clear that the Ministry of Food will not encroach upon the functions of the Ministry of Agriculture in regard to the production of food,     Any action undertaken by the Ministry of Food for the purpose of encouraging production shall be through the agency of the Ministry of Agriculture in England, the Scottish Board of Agriculture, or the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Ireland,,-as the case may be, &apos;(7)    The Ministry of Food, the Vlieat Commission&apos; and the Sugar Commission to bo invited periodically to survey the situation in respect of the commodities under their respective controls and to furnish a quarterly report to the Cabin&quot;t, with a view to dispensing with those controls at the earliest pee sible moment.
2.     The Committee desire to confirm the recommendations contained in their Interim Report CP. 655, that the control of imported bacon should be continued pending the establishment of an alternative source of supply, and further recommend that the Ministry of Food should be authorised to purchase the whole of the Danish exportable surplus of bacon until the end of 1920 on the understanding that any purchase of Danish Bacon should, pro tanto,be compensated by a. reduction in the purchase of American Bacon.3*     The Committee have further considered the recommend-ations in their Interim Report that the price of Sugar should be advanced for Grocery Sugars from 8d to lOd at the time of the Budget statement, and that the amount of the ration should be reviewed at the same time   Haying regard to the statements made to them by the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Sugar Supplies the Committee are of opinion that both the increase in price and the. increase in ration should be .made at once..     The Committee hold the view that the Sugar Commission cannot safely continue to trade at present prices *     They ere at present paying hip-her prices for their supplies than they receive from the consumer and their Reserve Insurance Fund will be exhausted by the end of August.,     Moreover, regard must be had to the fact that when the time arrives for de-control prices will probably be falling..   The Commission will then be obliged to get rid of their stocks on a falling market and a fund must be kept in reserve for that purpose * It was felt by some members of the Committee that it would be very dangerous to increase the price of Sugar at praoti-cally the same time as the price of other staple commodities but the Committee, while having due regard to this con-sideration, are of opinion that unless steps are
taken to increase prices immediately it will beimpossible to avoid a mush more violent rise in price in Augusto     Mcreo&quot;vert- as the Sugar Commission are ina position to alloW an immediate increase in the sugar ration the Committee hope that the irritation causedby the rise in price may thereby he considerably allayedThey also feel that it would go a long way to easecriticism if a limit were again imposed upon the amount,of sugar which ,may be used for confectionery and fancycakes to the prejudice of domestic supplies.The Ctmmittee accordingly recommend to the Cabinet:(1)   An immediate advance in the retail price of grocery 3ugars from 8d to lOd and an increase in the ration of domestic sugar from 6 oz. to 8 cz. as from March 22nd.(2)   The publication of a new Order limiting the amount ctf sugar which may be used for confectionery and fancy cakes.H.
