THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.^I:5M^ INTOXICATING LIQUOR (REGULATIONS)   BILL,i     i \Memorandum by the Minister of Health,-.................-dALL&amp;feT&apos;There are three matters in this Bill on which I should like to make some observationst   &apos;li :OTCM^JiREAS^   I take it that in any case we do not desire, seriously to prejudice State Purchaseo In my view it&apos; is the only fair means of achieving an ultimate solution of these problems.   Clauses 25 and 26 relate to this matter, and&apos; it is to be observed that -(a) The Bill&apos; involves that each and every time the Commission thinks a.new.area should be brought :under State  . Purchase, it will have to come to Parliament.   The Clauseas drafted will be attacked by Anti-Purchasers as raising the issue and by Pro-Purchasers as not placing it upon a satisfactory basis, and every time a Provisional Order Bill came up the battle would have to be fought afresh.(b) Unless the conditions under which the Trade is. to be compensated have been previously^determined by Parliament in the present Bill, voters will be in doubt whether they are dealing fairly with the Trade or not, and I think this, may have a considerable influence- in the case of electors who would hesi tate to vote for State Purchase if they had no idea of the financial terms involved,,It appears to me to be essential therefore that the Bill should include the terms- on which the&apos; Trade is to be acquired in any new area and thereby, secure the avoidance of a number of special Bills hereafter*2* OPT IONS OPEN TO ELECTORS.    I think that it would be a manifest, advance if, say, the inhabitants of a County or county/
County Borough Area were entitled to vote on the question of State Purchase s!ov their area periodicallya   This, I belleyo., was the view.of most of the Members of the Cabinet Committee appointed last Spring on this question.In order to meet the various views, I suggest that there.be set up a triple or possibly even a quadruple option/ viz:-(1).. Status quo; -(2).   Purchase; (3),   Prohibition with compensation; (4).   ?      Reduction w,Ith compensation.I do not think however,, that the vote on pro-, hibltion. should be allowed to come in before, say 1927,   -so as to give time for the necessary fund to be collectede3. IMPROVED PREMISES,     One other matter&apos;which will, I think, call forth a great deal of opposition from temperance quarters is that relating to improved licensed premises5 The proposals as they stand would, I think, as they concern individual cases, bo opposed on tho ground that it is only making drink more attractive and would appear to be contrary to the intentions of Licensing law a   The best method of undertaking reforms of this character, as is abundantly shown in the Carlisle area, is by a comprehensive scheme go that the matter can be dealt with as a whole over the area concerned, , .Ministry of Health.0. ADDISON. 15.3,1920.
