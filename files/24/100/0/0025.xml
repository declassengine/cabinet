SECRET. -    1 irish     SEE?     -     GOVERNMENT.SOME NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS ON A REGENT VISIff TO IRELAND.To The Chairman - Irish Conciliation Group.Following upon my recent visit to Ireland and in fulfilment of the promise which I made at the last meeting of the  &apos; Irish Conciliation Group &quot;before the close of last Session, I have now the honour to submit a brief report upon the situation in Ireland as 1 found it, with a summary of the views to which   ex-pression was Given by various representative people with whom I carnc in contacto   I venture also to add some notes which are derived from continuous correspondence during the past month with almost every school of political and religious thought in Ireland.I apologise for the delay in completing this statement but Immediately after my return from Ireland, certain-incidents took place in Irish Administration.; which, to some extent, brought about a modification of view on the part of certain prominent Irish personages whom I itGfcfcxi felt it was very desirable to conciliate * This led to considerable correspondence. I am able now, I think so far as the complexity and difficulty of the Irish problem permits, to place the general position pretty fairly and clearly before those friends in the House of Commons who are anxious to support the Government in making an honest effort to promote a settlement in Irelanda1* It is painful to commence this report by stating the naked fact that in the view of everybody whom I met in Ire-land, the condition   of that unhappy country has never been more deplorable in the memory of any Irishman now living than it is at the present moment.   Indeed the state of Ireland is very much worse than is realised in Great Britain and active rebellion may blaze up at any moment:   This distressing condition of things is accounted for by every Irishman one meets in Ireland in accordance with his own peculiar prejudice, but I feel that in making some effort towards a solution of the difficulties to be contended against,-any examination of the alleged causes of Irish discontent would be wholly unprofitable. Continued reflection upon Irish History has been the peculiar misfortune of Irishmen for generations and the sooner all sections in Ireland drop recrimination and honest: l&apos;5?kind courageously face the plain duty of getting the country out of the morass in which it is floundering, the better alike for Ireland herself and for the people of this country*II It may, however, be obcBrved that Castle Government, which is being so bitterly attacked on both sides of the 1-rislj sea had had to shoulder gigantic responsibilities and must be judged by a somewhat different test than that which is applied by a large body of opinion in Ireland and an influential section of the Press in Great Britain.   It is quite true that the Government of Ireland by Dublin Castle is wholly different from any Executive in the Empire, but it must be recognised that no other executive in any part of the King&apos;s Dominions - not excluding that of South Africa during the war - has had. to deal with problems so delicate and embarrassing as have succeeded each other, almost daily, in Ireland since the Easter week rebellion of 1916.III It is of course to be deplored that there has beena series of grave blunders in the methods adopted by Dublin Castle In dealing with Irish disaffection; and these have, in the main, been due, I think, to the want of a clearer perception, of the psychology of the great mass of the Irish people on the part of British statomen and officials who, in the very nature of things, have been more or less detached from the subtle and peculiar qualities of Irish character.   If in thifeconnection one historicalincident/
incident may be referred to, there is no doubt Whatever that the visit of Mr, Asquith to Dublin following upon the rebellion on 1916 and his subsequent speech in the House of Commons on Irish policy have done, infinite harm in Ireland and have been in no small measure, responsible for the almost hopeless and helpless rv/.ss in which Ireland finds itself to-dayc No one questions Mr* Asquith&quot;s good faith, but there is a general agreement that the adoption at that time of a more.firm policy, coupled with a substantial measure of self-government, would have completely changed the whole political out look of the country.IV, H.re I would point out that notwithstanding the tragic events which mark the story of the past few years, the highest tribute must bo paid to the loyalty   and devotion of the Irish police in the faithful discharge of their duties, surrounded as their lives have been with every device of petty tyranny and social ostracism  men the organising genius of Celtic mind has imposed upon them     It is true that the dismissal of General Byrne&apos; has caused considerable perturbation among the police, but this fact notwithstanding:, I am convinced from my talk with many of the men and several of the officers, as well as civilians representative of all classes, that the   Irish Police *&apos;orce in its entirety canbe absolutely relied upon within the limits of.their capacity to uphold the law,   I think it well to emphasise this point, and. the. ref ection is condoling that neither the earlier cajolery of Sinn Fein nor the later boycott, intimidation, midnight attack and murder have sapped&apos;the foundations of Irish police&apos; loyalty.V. The e:...tr ordinary paradox in Ireland at the moment is, that the country presents at one and the same time a whole-sale disregard for all forms of law and a decree of economic prosperity unprecedented in Irish historyo   -Hie -\rish farmer whose economic position is mainly due to wise land legislation, is not merely, comparatively speaking, prosperous?, having regard to his position ten years ago, but is far better&apos;off than English or Scottish farmers who enjoy apparently much greater opportunitiesoVI * An unfortunate fact in connection with   recent Irishtroubles is the rebirth of the Secret Societies which have always been -the Immediate result of wide-spread agitation in that country in the past *   I   think it reasonable to suggest that while the Sinn Fein movement has indirectly been responsible for all the crime committed against the police and others, the-actial criminal acts themselves are more to be attributed to the members of these Secret Societies then to the Sinn Fein movement itselfc   In the. South and V.est of Ireland   the Secret Society is operating, not as a definite part of the rebel   organisation, but as the inevitable accompaniment of its open antagonism to the Government and the whole machinery of adminlstration*VII* Having made these general observations I now proceedwith the substance of the Information I received and the opinions I gathered during my Irish tour *The various persons and groups with whom I came in contact may be classified as follows :-1* An eminent Roman Catholic prelate who reuei^d me with the greatest kindness and discussed every phase of the Irish question with me for upwards of two hours o23 Several Roman Catholic Priests, including especially Canon.P. Lyons, Parish Priest of Ardee, who is one of the very ablest of the younger generation of the Irish Priesthood and in all probability will succeed Cardinal Logue as ^rohbishop of Armagh **/

A, Anders on.VIII.      It would be difficult to recite in detail the volume and variety of opinion to which expression was given at all the con- . versations which took place, but the following summary indicates in general terns what to ok place(!)   Taking the most important personage first, the views expressed to me by the member of the E. Co Hierarchy were :,-(a) The Irish Roman; Catholio Bishops were vehemently opposed to the commission of crime upon any pretext whatever, and according to him, emphatically condemned the criminals. It was, however, the&apos; fact that Secret Societies rapidly grev/ up with the advancement of Sinn &quot;Fein and the membership of these bodies included persons who had no regard for religion or morality.(b) In his view, Castle Government had heen, in the main, responsible for the unhappy condition of Ireland.    He expressed the greatest personal regard and admiration for Lord French, but held very strongly that the Lord Lieutenant was surrounded by officials of the old ascendancy classwho were treating the Irish troubles of the time on the same principle of repression and the application of force as had been done in the days of the Land League and in the still earlier days of the Fenian Conspiracy^      He was quite confident a more sympathetic attitude towards the Irish people and a more intimate understanding of its psychology and character would have made an Irish settlement on hopeful lines possible.(o) He asserted very strongly that the mass of Irishmendesire to. live within the Empire, that there was no desire to continue antagonism tov/ards the people of Great Britain, that the   Sinn Fein movement had acquired its strength as the result of repeated failures on the part of the: Government to keep its promises0 and that on eaoh day that/Cajtle PasS03 under the exist in^vAohrinistrabion the difficulty^ of settlement beoame more^intensified.(d) The Irish Education Bill introduced in the last Sessionof Parlia:nent aroused intense bitterness among the Irish Roman CaSholic. Bishops and he condemned the action of the Government in very forceful terms.    He was unable to understand the real reason why the Cabinet should undertake the introduction of an Irish Education Bill on the eve of a projected Home Rule Bill which would obviously give complete control of educational matters to the Irish Government/&apos; He informed m that no incident in recent relations between the British Government and Ireland had out more deeply into the feelings of the Irish people than en attempt which, on the face of it, was regarded as a means of destroying the inf luonoe of the Irish Roi-an Catholic Bishops in&apos; the direction of Roman Catholio Education./ (c) discussing
Discussing ths forthcoming Hone Rule Bill his attitude towards tho Bill as out lino d in the Prime Minister&apos;&apos;s speech was deoidedly antagonistic *     Ho did not &quot;believe that any section of Irishmen would accept the Bill, and he folt it would be hopeless to impose a msasure upon tho Irish people which, in his view,, would load to much- greater confusion than evon that which obtains at present.Coming to details, his main objection  to the Bill was its creation of what ho described as a &quot;patohwork Ulster&quot;?     H3 would be prepared to accept tho historic province as the northern Parliamentary area provided tho Bill wore otherwise satisfactory, but ho was determined to give strenuous opposition if the policy of the Government woro to persist in their effort to divide Protestant Ulster from the rest of Ireland.Inraocopting tho historic provinoo of Ulster as the area of ths Northern Homo Rule Parliament3 he expressed anxiety on the subject of the maintenance of denominational schools lander existing management and looked forward to tho embodiment of sa:feguards in the Go ver remit Bill for all such Schoolau     He agreed that this might be achieved by the adoption of an arrangement such as Vnat wliich^Fas adjusted between Upper and Lower Canada and whioh was ultimately embodied in tho North America Acto(NoB* - Soe British North America Act, 1867, Section 93).He would cheerfully aooept Free Trade with England,but ,regidly iraintainod. that Ireland should have control of its own fiscal policy^    Ho deprecated very strongly the boycott whioh &quot;was being organised in the West of Ireland against Belfast business houses, and was firm in his desiro to prevent customs boundaries being created between Northern and Southern Home Rule Aroas*(i) Ho was prepared to accept Ireland7s responsibilityfor the payment of a contribution to Imperial Expenditure but folt that the sum for which Ireland should booomo liable ought to be^very much loss than that suggested in the Prime Minister&apos;s Speech&quot;(2)u        Ths goneral impression gad.ned from my interview with this head of the R* Op Oiroroh in Ireland was that in tho first instance , he was strenuously opposed to any division of Ireland at all, but in order to meet the Ulster difficulty ho wpuld accept partition with tho nine counties of USster as one Home Rule Area and the three Southern provinces as the othoro He earnestly desired an early settlement, but he intensely distrusts tho bona fides of British Ministers, and above everything else, is very hostile to the present methods of Irish administration.-.    There can be no doirlt that Cardinal Loguo is still a very great influence in Ireland and his support -in makjpg any Homo Rule soheme ultimately aooept able to the Roman Catholic population through the Bishops and Priesthood  would be invaluableo(3) I now turn to tho Sin Fein point of view which was repeated authoritatively to me by certain priests of the Regular Clergy in. Dublin and who I haw the&quot; host reason to bolieve ere in the fall confidence of tho leaders of that Movements(a)   Ths leaders of Sinn Fein adhere rigidly to tho demand for a Republic because) thsy declare that any reduction of who demand would imiediotely lead to a whittling down of the actual concessions which may bo icq do by the &quot;Government.. nmy tnerefore be regarded as certain that the Sinn i-emerswi.il continue to clamour for a Republic until the Homo Hulo Bill booones an Act.    Tho quality of tho Act &quot;vi.ll/then.
then determine how far Sinn Fein will be placated.(b) The saner men among the leaders of Sinn Fein and the mass of the Southern population in Ireland who adhere to Sinn Fein, either on grounds of sympathy or fear, do not want the continuance of unrest in Ireland, and a large and generous measure of Home Rule conceived in such a way as would make for the ultimate union of the whole of Ireland would be acceptable to the immense majority of thepeople.(c) It is of course the case that a certain number of extremists and the whoHe of the criminal class who make up the secret societies will continue to agitate and make trouble, but no doubt is. felt that on the country itself beaming responsible for the detection and punishment of crime, the rebellious and criminal sections would graduall; tend towards vanishing point.(d) The leaders of Sinn Fein have had it conveyed to me that the essential consideration in any proposed Home Rule? measure which would induce them to make it workable in Ireland is that Ireland shall have complete control of her own finance .(e) The Sinn Feiners do.not object to ah Imperial con-tribution although they would at the beginning make great pretence of violent opposition to it, and it has been asserted that Sinn Fein would be quite billing to accept a full measure of Free Trade with Great Britain.(f) It had been declared to me while in Ireland and has since been supported in many letters which I have received that if the Government imposed upon Ireland a measure giving Ireland control of finance making the limit of the Northern province coterminous with the boundary of the nine Counties of Ulster and so adjust the Constitution of the Council of Ireland as to gradually encourage the concentration of power in the United Parliament;) Sinn Fein itself would-be prepared to accept;-&apos;&apos;(iii)   Froe Trade wi t$c Gre at Bri tain.(g)     I may observe that while those who spoke for Sinn Fein were bitter in their criticism of the present Chief Secretary and the officials in the Castle administration, they spoke exceedingly kindly of Lord French and expressed the deepest regret for the horrible outrage which has been perpetrated upon him,,(4)     The views expressed by the ex-Nationalists H,P:s by Nationalist business men and by leading priests such as Canon Lyons of Arde&amp; in.a large measure coinvide with the views expressed by the eminent R. Co prelate but the following further points which arose in discussion with them are worthy of note:-(a)   The Roman Catholic Bishops in Ireland are at present . almost evenly divided in their attachment to Sinn Fein and the old Constitutional Nationalists,     Nearly all the older Bishops are on the Constitutional side, the younger ones being almost without exception, sympathctically disposed towards Sinn Fein.     An actual analysis of the names and political views show 15 Irish R.C, Bishops as Sinn Seiners and 13 asbelonging
belonging to the older political school; and of course it will be evident that the vigour and enthusiasm of the younger men, are far more manifest than that of their seniors.(b) The personnel of Maynooth College may be taken as wholly Sinn Pein;   of its professorial staff only one member, Rev. Walter lacdonald is anti*Sinn Fein, and of course it goes without saying that the entire mass of the students attach themselves to Sinn Fein doctrine.     This is obviously most serious in the outlook for the future of Ireland as with relays of young priests going down to scattered parishes in Ireland, year after year all strongly animated by Sinn Fein ideals and carrying with them in every parish the whole of the younger, men, the hope of peace, in the absence of a substantial measure of self-government, is indeed remote,(c) The two Bishops who from the point of view of an Irish settlement carry most weight in Ireland and who, on account of their political qualities and administrative ability count for most in the consideration of any Home Rule Scheme are, Dr. 0&apos;Donnell, Bishop of Raphoe and Dr Kelly, the Eishop of Ross.I regret that I was unable to see personally either of these gentlemen and I do not feel justified in getting in touch with them by letter until the text of the Bill is available.     The remarkable part played by Dr. 0*Donnell in recent Irish history and particularly during the proceedings of the Irish Convention will be in the memory of everyone who is familiar with Irish affairs.(5)     I met a considerable number of Southern Unionists who attach themselves to the leadership of Lord Midleton and who were determinedly opposed to any partition of Ireland.     These gentle-men have no doubt a very good case to present against being placed at what they describe as, at the mercy of a Southern Parliament, but vehement declarations of all kinds of Nationalists whom I i et that no unfair advantage would in any way be taken of the Uniorjist minority in the South of Ireland, is of some value on the othejf side of the account.     It need hardly be added however, that Southern Unionists are exceedingly slow, and naturally so, in placing confidence in Nationalists&apos; statements.(6)     I talked with some Unionists who live in the South and Wqst of Ireland who were perfectly prepared to accept a Home Rule measure and satisfied that their rights and privileges as Irish citizens would be respected,     True this number is small but it embraces some of the leading business men and professional men.(7)     All the representatives of - Irish industry with whom I dis-cussed the situation earnestly seek for peace and will gratefully accept and cordi ally work for the support of any legislative reform which tends to bring about the settlement of Ireland.(3)     Of the North of Ireland Unionists it may at once be said that whether they represent the landed aid manufacturing classes or the labour classes, they are equally opposed to any Home Rule measure whatever, bub are agreed if it becomes an Imperial necessity that Ireland must have Home Rule, they will cheerfully accept a Northern parliament in which the existing Unionist elements will have a definite majority.IX. Turning now to certain observations which I may be per-mittcd to make as arising out of my Irish visit and from the mass of correspondence from Ireland which reached me since my return, the following conclusions hove been borne in upon me:-
(1)     nothing could, be more disastrous in the present state of high tension and anxiety which preyail in Ireland than that the Government should fail to definitely go forward Tfith their projected Hc-me Rule Bill.     If the v?holc Community in Ireland,, forth and South alike,, becomes&apos; (a) clearly convinced that a Government measure \?ill bo introduced;,   (b)   that it will be carefully considered from the point of every existing interest in Ireland, and (c) that it will be amended in terms as generous as possiblej consistent with Imperial safety. the future welfare of Ulster and the maintenance of the law in Ireland, the effect will have far-reaching moral value.     The Government should therefore Ox-e? I think, make it as clear and emphatic as possible that the Bill will be proceeded with till it becomes an Act and. that- Ireland mutt accept the responsibility for the success of the Act when once it is passed into law,(2)     The objection urged by certain persons that the Prime Minister is imposing the Home Rule measure upon Ireland against the wishes of the Irish people5 need not be seriously entertained if the structure of the Bill Is such as to make the&apos;measure just and workable.     Ho responsible body of persons in Ireland has yet offered any alternative which would obviate the direct -imposition of the measure by the British Government.,     In my judgment it &quot;would be perfectly hopeless to try and devise in present circumstances, any machinery \*hich&apos; could be in the least helpful in securing Irish consent to any proposed settlement.(3)    Let It be; assumed that the Government is determined: to proceed with the Bill regardless of&apos; any opposition or criticism In Ireland?,   then four points of vital moment in the structure of the Bill present themselves for consideration;   these are.;-(a) The area to be included within theoontrol of the Northern or Ulster parliament.(b) The powsss to he&apos; conferred on the two parliaments which it is proposed to set up u;vler the Bill.(c) $is control of Irish.finance.(d) The Constitutional Status and powers of the proposed Council of Ireland.,
(4)The so points may now be taken in order : he territorial limits of the proposed Northern Province may be determined in threa several ways via, , (1) The historic province of Ulster embracingnine Counties and which, be it noted, has been recognised for administrative purposes under the Act constituting the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.(11) Counties voting themselves out by County option.(ill) A certain homogeneous area - l.e. with considerable Unionist and Frotestant majority - comprising the larger part of Ulster with probably six Counties as a basis.(5)      The area of &quot;Ulster&quot;it is probably worth examining the problem of the area of Ulster somewhat carefully0      It is argued on the side cf the Ulster Unionist, and indeed similar views have also been expressed by certain Nationalists that it would be dangerous to the buoco-ps of the Home Rule Scheme if by making historic Ulster the Northern Parliament area a set of conditions would be reproduced within the boundaries of Ulster not unlike those which now obtain in Ireland ac a whole, that Is to say, a continuous struggle between a majority and a minority^   People who urpo this point think that the three Roman C..tholic Counties would continuously endeavour to separate from Ulster, and that the struggle between olosely approximate votlna powers in Ulster would not tend to ultimate Irish unity.   It is also urged and with a ,:?ood show of reason, that only by converting what would, generally speaking, be the dominant Protestant section of Ulster, could a union of the v/hole of Ireland be effected, that is to say, that a mere chance Nationalist majority in the Ulster F: rllament could never reclly cany Protestant Ulster in forcing a union with the rest of Ireland.(6)    The information which I received end which I think carries considerable weight does not convince me that these argumentp count for very much,      I am quite persuaded it will be much better for Ulster and .uch better for Ireland if the nine Counties are included in the Northern Home Rule area I am satisfied that the strong opposition which will e\lst in Ulster will operate in softening differences between ITorth and South and will eventually prevent thrt development of antagonism and the gradual evolution of difference in policy as between Ulster and the rest of Ireland which would operate apalnat the possibility of union0 It will be remembered that the Ulster Unionists have always pressed for the inclusion of the nine Counties in their sohemo of a Unionist Ulster, and no reliable opinion baa been expressed to me which would show that the Catholic population of the Counties In which that religion predominates, would decline to ^nter the nine Counties arrangement, or would subsequently agitate for union with the South of ireland   My personal view is strongly in support of the, opinion of every leading Irishman whom I consulted viz * , that the who 2ft of Ulster should be included in the northern Home&apos;Bu]a are^T County option&quot;having been definitely deolined by the UnloiSata need not be discussed,(7)     It should be noted that the establishment of two parliaments involves the apportionment of the revenue raised in Ireland and also the present Irish expenditure,,    This
This expenditure, in the case of some departments, is partly &quot;All Ireland&quot; and partly &quot;County&quot; , and obviously apportionment for sub-divided Counties would present serious difficulties.(b)   Powers to be conferred on Jjooal Parliaments.(8)     In discussing the extent of the powers which should be conferred upon the Northern and Southern Parliaments under the Bill, I prepared for my friends in Ireland a comparative table Betting forth :-(a)   The powers conferred upon the Irish parliament in the Act of 1914.and   (b)   The pavers which were recommended to be oonferred upon it in the Report of the Irish Convention in 1918.It may be said at once that apart from the Northern Unionist view which is against Home Rule of any kind and the Sinn Pein view which 1b. stage-managed fashion declares that &quot;no kind of Home Rule will be acceptablep moderate opinion in Ireland is in favour of the powers conferred in the Act of 1914 being expanded by the addition of the greater part of the powers recommended by the Convention.   The following limitations laay be noted :-(1)     The Control of gugtcms? Excise and Inoome Tax, There can be no doubt that in Nationalist Ireland at- all events, the overwhelming opinion is in favour of the complete control of customs and excise by either the new Parliaments to be set up in the North or South, or fif agreement between these two bodies oan in any way be effected, by the proposed Central Parliament or Council of Ireland,,   None of the persons with whom I examined this vital but very complex matter would help in solving the grave difficulties which arise in consequence of partition, and although it was strongly argued upon roe that the more sane section of Sinn Fein, and this section a very large majority of the whole, would accept the Bill if accompanied by control of fiscal policy, there was no adequate answer to the question how satisfactory administration could be established with two independent Parliaments and with the strongly contrasted sets of conditions which prevail in North and Southn Irishmen may be prepared to concede that there ought to be no customs barrier between Great Britain and Ireland, but I believe every shade of thought in Ireland would be violently opposed to oustons barriers being set up between the Northern and Southern Parliamentary areas.   It will be a matter for the careful consideratlonsof Parliament whether customs and excise should not, for the time being, be under the control of a Joint Board appointed by the Imperial Parliament upon which, both the Irish Parliaments would have representation with the provision that on the establishment of union between the , two Parliaments in Ireland, customs and excise should veist
in the now Central Parliament or Council of Ireland.     I may point cut here that no subject affecting the forthcoming Bill is regarded of more vital consequence in Ireland than the adjustment between the two countries of fiscal relation-ship said the transfer to Ireland at the earliest possible moment of complete control over her own fiscal policy. Indeed, I would like to urge that it may be found possible, conditional upon the South of Ireland Parliament, accepting the Empire, Free Trade with England, and at the same time throwing overboard all wild theories of separation, whefeisr it would not be wise Statesmanship to confer, a3 soon as possible, the control of customs and excise upon the Council of Ireland.Ic particular difficulty presents itself in relation to other Irish taxation which I think can be almost at once handed over to the respective Parliaments, or to the Council of Ireland,(ii) The second difficult limitation of power concerns control of the R,I.C and D,M, Police, and here I am bound to confess that with the present condition ftf Ireland, it would be most unwise to transfer the control of these bodies to any Irish parliament, nor do I think it advisable to set up in the Bill an actual limit of time after which the Iri3h Police would pass over to the new Irish Executives; it would be better I believe, to make the transfer of the police dependent upon the gradual restoration of order and the 1 7al acceptance of the principles of settled Govern-ment by the Irish people.(iii) With regard to the Irish Judiciary, this must certainly be a reserved power.(iv) I believe it will be expedient to give control of the post Office to the Council of Ireland,     There are., no doubtt serious obstacles in the way of doing this at once but it should be effected within the shortest period con-Biatent with the establishment of orderly administration in Ireland.(v)      Old age pensions and National Insurance might be handed over to the Council of Ireland and the administration of the land Commission and Estates Commissioners treated as -recommended in the land purchase Report prepared for the Convention of 1918.(9)   Generally speaking, it will help the acceptance of the Bill to give to the two new Parliaments now proposed, as much as possible of the powers recommended to be gi\ren tothe Irish
the Irish Parliament under the Report of the Convention* There should, if possible be no reservation which would be regained as hurtful to Ireland on historical and sentimental grounds, and no reservation in the new Bill should lend itself to the interpretation that British commercial Interest was still pursuing its old time polioy of strangling Irish material development.(o)   Finance.It will be essential in order to make the Bill more acceptable to the Southern Provinces that its financial provisions, shall, in fact, be as generous to the South of Ireland as they are to the whole of Ireland as indicated in the Prime Minister^ speeoho   The Importance of this will be clear from consideration of the faot that while the gross revenue realised in Ireland may be in excess of aggregate Irish expenditure, it ?.s quite possible that the margin in the case of th* Northern Parliamentary area may be gre&amp;tly in excess of that available for the South of Ireland.   Indeed, it is quite possible that the apportionment between the two Parliaments might be such as to leave a large margin in excess in the North with a deficit in the Gouthc   The method of apportionment will have to be bo devised as to secure full confidence in Ireland where suspicion of British Treasury adjustments in relation to Irish finance is still very strong.(d)   Powers of the Council of Ireland aIt cannot be urged too earnestly that every conceivable encouragement should be given in the framework of the new Bill to a growing tpndenoy towards centralisation of power in the Counoll of Ireland as against the retention of such power In the two local Parliaments *   I think it will be desirable that the Department of Agriculture and Technical, instruction for instance, which has achieved a great measure of success in every part of Ireland should remain under oentral control, and as far as possible the same principle would apply to the Irish Local Government Board, the new Department which must be oreated to replace the present Irish Office of Works * the Irish Land Commission, Congested Districts and the Irish Branch of the Ministry of Transport-   It is difficult to conceive continued efficiency and eoonomy in the Branches of administration indicated if control is to be divided between North and South.It may also be possible that National Institutions in Dublin may be retained under Central control and wherever possible, duplication of bodies like the General Register Office, Valuation Offtoe, and certain other departments should be avoided.   It should certainly be the aim of the Bill to make the Council of Ireland a body possessing real nower and give it every opportunity of initiative in bringing&quot; the legislative action and administrative work of the two Provinous into continuous harmony.   The more the Bill indicates the clear intention of the Government to provide a measure which will be a solid basis for a united Ireland in the near future, the greater the hope of the Bill being aocepted by moderate opinion and afterwards acquiesced in by the more extreme.sections In Ireland.It may not be without interest here to quote some extracts from a letter of a very able Irish Parish Priest who has been a life-long Nationalist and who Is not without strong sympathies at the moment with Sinn Fein.   These EXtoesoa extracts will indloate the quality of thought which runs through the mind of the more responsible and&quot;earnest Irishmen who are really anxious to put an oral to the present regime of misery and to make the most of the opportunities whioh the Bill offers.
&quot;The latest Hone Rule proposals have been received and discussed in an impatient temper that bodes ill for them, and for the future of Ireland.   There is only one point to be argued and decided - just the question always left out - is it better for Ireland to aoeept those proposals than to reject them?&quot;.............If it wer* a choice between two Parliamentsand one, no Nationalist would hesitate for a moment about rejecting two and setting up one.   Now, is there such a choice?   Can any opponent of the scheme assure his countrymen that, if two parliaments be rejected now, a single legislature will be set up for all Ireland, in ten or twenty years to come? Can any honest man pledge his word for such a result?&quot;In twenty years we may expect the same objections and difficulties to obstruct the establishment of a single Parliament that prevented it for the last forty.   The powers triat defeated Gladstone, Butt, Parnell and Redmond, will hardly fall down affrighted at a puff of Irish passion.&quot;Should the Union system continue the present generation of Ulster Unionists will hand down their hate of Home Rule to their children in an intensified form.   Will any power be found to coerce them later on any more than now?    Certainly; not Great Britain,      Nor if the impossible suggestion, sometimes made , were oarried out, and the question left to ^america&apos;s decision, would i-anerica coerce &quot;Ulster&quot;,   would she not more likely adopt Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s plan?   That is what she did in her own case.    mhen two states held out and refused to join the Union, America let them go their own way, and later on actually changed the Constitution to coax them in.    Yet Amerioa will come over and coerce not only &quot;Ulster&quot; but Great Britain for us I&quot;3ut if &quot;Ulster&quot; could be forced into a National settlement, would it be wise to compel her?   Par from it I She would then be an enemy within the gates , with a new cause to ever inflame her hostility, and confirm her hatred of Home Rule, and her diBtrust of her countrymen.        The greatest enemies of Ireland might well pity her starting on her new career with a dagger near her heart.    An Irish Parliament and Government could not rule &quot;Ulster&quot; reluctant,&quot;On the other hand if &quot;Ulster&quot; accepts her own parliament, she admits the principle of Home Rule - a prinoiple bound to lead her into a National legislature.    To hasten her steps thither nothing could be better than to give a parliament for the whole province.      The equality of different religions, the identity of interests made manifest, the solution of difficulties made in friendship would breed friendships and make those farseeing men ambition a National stage for display of their abilities.    The best of all ways of preventing sucji a blesed   ending of our enemities is the mad idea of boyoottmg Belfast trade in the West,        The authors of such a scheme know little of ^hat stuff the &quot;Ulster&quot; men are made , when they expect Belfast to oapitulate to Tuam for money&apos;.    No, no better means could be adopted to confirm them in their fear of Home ?uule,&quot;To begin consideration of vfr.Lloyd George&apos;s proposals by denouncing their author looks like fear of judging&apos; them on their merits,      It is an effort to befog the Irish people lest they should see the .^ood points of the plan0   Besides, the constant stream of insults poured on the prime Minister, and indeed on the whole of the people of Great Britain,Tindicates
indicates neither sanity nor a generous heart in Ireland,Whether we like it or not, Mr, Lloyd George is the great man of Europe todays   oinoe he took the plaoe of Mr. Wilson heis the most powerful statesman in the world.   The nationsf)       hang on his words and stretch out their hands for his help.The life-long foes of Home Rule may go soot-free, while allIreland&apos;s hate is concentrated on the one statesman capableand wishful of settling the National cause, whioh if heaccomplishes it, will shew him to future generations asIreland&apos;s greatest benefactor, and our eons will be erecting statues to his memory,&quot;There is just one&apos; person more powerful for good or evil to Ireland than the Prime Minister - the English voter! Him, too, Irishmen seem set upon making an enemy, regardless of consequences^     Ireland indeed Is just now staggering under incessant draughts from the cup of hatea     Surely it is the duty of eaoh of her sons to try to hold her back from the pit of despair, open at her feet,&quot;After forty years of disappointments let Irishmen grasp the present chance of making a beginning of self-government, if we do really believe In Home Rule at all,&quot;X. It is, I think, unfortunate that an Sduoatlon Bill for ireland is being pressed forward, side by side.with a Home Rule Bill,   As I have already pointed cut, nothing has more profoundly disturbed the minds of the Roman Catholic Bishops and Priesthood than this Education Bill, and it is morai-ly certain that one of the first acts of the Southern Irish Parliament would oe to repudiate it.      The following extract from a letter from an eminent Irish Ecclesiastical expresses what I believe to be the view of the Irish Roman Catholic Church on the Education Bill&quot;The only new incident is the latest re the EduoationBill,   It is welT known that,the^eaclers of the.teachers have been &apos;got at! fromLondonand with the money bribe in oheBill hava allowed themselves to support this patent absurdity of a Bill in the hope of Queering the pitch&apos; for the Irish Bishops and starting a cross-current row in Ireland between Bishops and teachers, : With a Home Rule Aot on the statulWbook we are offered an English made Education Billl&quot;But the Bishops have taken a natural vantage position -aihmost coming into line with ninn Fein]and repudiating the British Parliament for the seoond time     and they have the people with them,   I met 4 or 5 of the Bishops in Dublin the day after the meeting at Maynooth and they are determined to fight this Bill as a Bill never was fought,   They will close every Catholic Bohool in Ireland, if it goes on.   They say so and they mean it,&quot;XII. It Is, I fear, quite hopeless to expect any real help from Ireland during the process of the Bill in Parliament.     I succeeded in forming in Dublin an informal Advisory Committee which will keep in touch with the Irish Conciliation Group in London, but I do not anticipate much mere than a repetition of the views which have been expressed to me.      I believe as things are new , the Government should boldly go forward with the Bill and should even be prepared to take great risks in order to males the Bill acceptable to the great mass of the Irish people who really want peace and contentment.    The Sinn Fein leaders notwithstanding their wild demands and illogical arguments are no fools;   on the contrary, their politioal instinct is decidedly acute and they are constantly alive&apos; to the doubtful value of mere &apos; agitation, both in Ireland and America in its aotual influence upon either the 3rltish or the felted States voter,   Sinn Fein knows that a Republic is impossible and in putting its demand very high its widest guides are prepared to accept loss,    A gerierou3 Bill, discussed in Parliament without bitterness 6,nd with every
manifest Intention of building up a new Ireland will, I believe, lay foundationsiin that country upon which a super-structure of law-abiding&apos;citizenship and economic and social progress will continue to be built up.(signed) !&amp;iJ.Hartnon, Honorary Secrotary Irish Conciliation Group024, Abingdon Street,Westminster, Sov711. 1st March, 1920 0
