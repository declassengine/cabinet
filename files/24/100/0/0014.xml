Stock) should be&apos; omitted.The main arguments for the retention of the Clause are(a) Parliamentary,(b) On the merits of the proposal, *(3)   As regards the Parliamentary arguments I agree&apos; that the pledges given for reintroduotion without alteration were strong. They were, however, neither desired nor welcomed by a considerable body of opinion in the House and I do not believe that the House would refuse support to an alteration of policy dictated by the paramount requirements of national finance and particularly of hotting! finance.(4)   On the merits of thd proposal I must first point out that under the Act already in force the Consolidated Fund is liable to bo oharged with  20,000,000.(5)   Secondly, an issue by the Electricity Coxnmisoioners with a Government guarantee, will not differ in its effect on the market from a Government issue, and wi11 drew upon the very limited fund of capital available for such issues.     0:hia is moot undesirable at the present time when this particular fund (which is already veryyy-^y: &apos;:&apos;V-v      -:.&apos;y yy&apos;-: ^ --J;-:&quot;: -&apos;;;v:^!:&apos;; ^.:&apos;:,j:v:    ).^:;:-J 1 &apos;:::/v&apos;&apos;:- y&apos;&apos;^yi^-\t:\yry.-- ^\^?^,,&apos;&apos;\^^:l.;&apos;^^^^^,jL^;,&apos;::&apos;&apos;^^^;^^^:v;y V&apos;i     v. -.!;:vv.-y.     :-\ &apos;.&apos;-: -^:&apos;&apos;&apos;y&apos;Otis ii
small compared with. -the--:t-ot a,L -c^^J^DeeMng^lirreirtm^t) is required to meet not only new issues, for example Local Loans issues,for housing, but also to digeat that large part of pa lit issue:.) which the subscribers never intended to hold &quot;as a perman^h&quot;t^ investment and ore now being- forced tj cell in order to provide themselves with the funds required for trade and similar purposes. Until the War issues are absorbed by genuine investors Government credit must remain weak,(6)   The guarantee of interest by the Treasury is neither a real one, involving the finding of the interest, or is inoperative.(7)     In the first base I can only advert to the principle whi^h I had to re-affirm repeatedly in regard to housing bonds and ask my colleagues not to insist on the Exchequer assuming this new burden,I   &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;  f &quot;:&apos;J(8)   In the latter case the guarantee depresses the whole of the Government&apos;o credit to no purpose.     Even housing bonds would benefit pro tanto by an announcement that the proposal to guarantee this       , stock had been dropped and the local loons Issjo for housing - purposes would benefit considerably,(9)   I cannot put too strongly to the Cabinet the fact &apos; hat c-grctrhousing programme will tax our resources to. the uttermost,.     Any loan:that we raise, or&apos; guarantees thatwe Give, for other purposes dp. protanto defeat the housing policy.     We have told Local Authorities thaM f &apos;they must put Housing first and postpone other schemes,     Wo mus^ do the same if we wish to succeed.(lnJid:)   A.O.Treasury, S,?;&apos;l.March Sth, 1920., 1 \\
