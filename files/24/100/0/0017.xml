^HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITTANICMAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.WglgARE Off THE BLIND *   &quot;Memorandum by the Minister,, of Health, ,,..      M,H. 12.I desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the  -urgent need for making further provision for the welfare;., of the Blind. .   In&apos;May, 1919, in fulfilment of a pledge given by my predecessor (Lord  Downham) in the House&apos;of -Commons in May, 1918, I obtained from the Cabinet sanction to the .. disbursement by the Ministry of an annual   Exchequer Grant in aid of certain services carried on by voluntary agencies on behalf of the Blind,     It was! recognised at the time that this grant was of an interim-nature pending the introduction of legislation, which legislation the Cabinet decided should . be introduced as early as possible,   , Accompanying this:-grant^ pledges were given in the House &quot;of Commons and have since been repeatedly endorsed at numerous deputations and in replies to. questions&quot; in. Parliament that further provision,for the ,Blind would be made in the present session of Parliament,     It was emphasised also.that the larger&apos; problem, namely that of,affording assistance to the unemployable Blind, was left untouched. Since that date.a private Bill, has been introduced on two occasions, first by Mr, Stephen Walsh towards the end of last session.    This Bill was not proceeded with.    The.same Bill has been introduced by Mr, Tillett this session and is set down for second reading on Friday, 12th instant,    This Bill imposes an obligation upon County Councils and County Borough Councils to provide for the education and training (including maintenanceduring/
during training) of the trainable blind the employment (including grant Of wage subsidy) of the employable blind, and the maintenance, at a rate of not less than 27/6 per week, of the unemployable blind,The Bill further proposes that half the 6ost of the proposed provision should be met&apos;out of Exchequer Grants * *&apos; 1 am - of opinion that legislation on those lines should be opposed.    So far as training is concerned, there are already ample permissive powers given to Local Education. Authorities to do all that the present Bill requires them to do, and I am&apos;convinced that any proposal to render obligatory on Local Authorities the far reaching duties imposed by the Bill would not only be strongly contested&apos; but would be pre-mature.    A conservative Estimate of the cost of these proposals to the State involves an annual Exchequer maintenance grant of not less than  750,000, together with an unknown sum for capital expenditure.On the other hand as a result of the introduction of this Bill, of the repeated pledges given by the Government^ and of tho pressure being brought to bear from many quarters includ-ing; the Trade Union Congress, the question of making further provision for the Blind has reached a critical stage * The chief requirements of the Blind are additional training facilities for such of the Blind as are capable of being trained, further workshop and hostel accommodation for the trained blind together with the provision of more Homos and pecuniary assistance in their own homes for the unemployable Blind,     I &quot;understand that the Board of Education have laid proposals be-fore the Treasury with a view to making increased grants fortraining/
training of the Blind in suitable occupations.    It is essential that workshop accommodation which) at present, is seriously deficient both in quality and quantity should be developed at the same time,    The chief hindrance to su^h development is the lack of capital mohios among the voluntary agencies which at present provide such accommodation and which are at present receiving but a bare maintenance grant from the Ministry,    It is suggested that power should be obtained enabling County and County Borough Councils and possibly some (jather bodies, to provide and maintain or con-tribute towards the provision and&quot; maintenance of workshops hostels and Homes and other places for the reception of the Blind,    In conjunction with such legislation it is suggested further that grant in aid should be given in respect of the capital expenditure of the above local authorities in making such provision.     It is not anticipated that the amount of such, grant would exceed  250,000 spread over a ^considerable number of years and it is believed that in respect of the ensuing financial year the sum of  25,000 would be sufficient. 6,      With regard to the question of affording direct pecuniaryassistance in their own homes to the unemployable Blind, the possibility of introducing legislation which would impose a share of the cost cn local authorities has been very carefully considered.    Blindness in itself does not ordinarily require medical services and Is a peculiarly disabling condition, especially from the age of 50 upwards, from the point of view of capability for training or employment.    For this reason blindness is a disability which doos not naturally fall within the ordinary, medical services carried on by the Health Authorities, while at the same time it cannot be regarded as properly falling within the non-health services of a reformedPoor/
Poor Law Authority.    It is suggested that the most suitable form of assistance to this class of blind person - a class forcing approximately 46$ of the total number of the Blind In the Country - is by way of weekly cash allowances to blind persons between the ages of 50 and 70.    The lower age is taken, because it is generally recognised that at 50 a blind person is no longer trstV&amp;ble and the upper age taken as marking the point at which the Old Age Pension Acts operate. I am approaching the Treasury therefore for their consent to the appropriation of an annual sum of  170,COO to enable the Ministry of Health to provide local committees with money to pay out such allowances to blind persons-Within this age group.4    After consideration it is believed that the. safest ; basis for such allowances would be to adopt the rate.of 10/- . a week, in order that,jthe age of&apos;70, when the Individual becomes eligible for old age pension, he shall not suffer any diminution of income.    The conditions of income limit . on eligibility for the allowance could on similar grounds be the same.    For the purpose of administration;it is suggested that, the existing local Pensions&apos; Commit tees &quot;: in: each&apos; County -and County Borough and other&apos;areas should be utilised., I desire, further, to have.sanction to seek legislative powers-requiring all agencies, which appeal to the public for funds on behalf of the Blind, to be registered by the appropriate local authority concerned and I would propose for this-, purpose to reenact the War Charities Act, 1916, with the substitution, where necessary and desirable, of the Minister of Health, for the Charity Commissioners.    I make this proposal because there is evidence that a number of so-called agencies for the Blind of very doubtful character are obtaining considerable sums ofmoney/
money from the public, and I am advised that under their present powers the tolice Authorities are unable to prosecute.^8.      It is unnecessary to emphasize the distressing-nature of.. . . &apos; .blindness or the ready appeal&apos;it makes to public sympathy;&quot;A V.Y;&apos;&apos;::Aand It need hardly be pointed out how much the attention ! of the public has been drawn to this 1 question by the continuousappeals made to it on behalf of the soldiers and sailors blinded .. in the war.&apos;    I understand also that a march of blind persons  . from the provinces, upon London is proposed, which,, If Carried. out? would no doubt olioit considerable public sympathy and, , support.     I feel confident&apos; therefore that the above proposals would receive tho ready assent&apos; of Parliament *    They have been devised with due regard to economy and the total annual cost involved, including the&apos; present grant provision, is not likelyto exceed, for&apos;England and Wales, more than  310,000 per annum6--It should be stated that there is evidence of. a decline in the, proportionate incidence of blindness amongst the civil population and I am confident&quot; that as a result.of further expert enquiry  .&apos; &apos; &apos; .Into the causation of blindness- means can be devised for accelerating this declining incidence.     The cost:involved9: . therefore, in the proposals for which I now seek sanction should, also be a declining charge on tne Exchequer.. .   .TRY OP HEALTH.C. ADDIS0N.8,3,1920.
