SECRET.CP.  353  (30).Copy  No.  ^ pTHE CABINET.THE  APPOINTMENT  OF  GOVERNOR  OF  BERMUDA.     MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARIES  OF  STATE FOR THE                         COLONIES AND  FOR  WAR.                         (Jn  continuation of CP. 315 (30).)     In accordance  with  the  decision of  the  Cabinet  at  their meeting  (57  (30)      16held  on  30th  September,  1930, we have again  considered  the question  of the  Abroadappointment  of  a  military  officer  of high  rank  as  Governor of Bermuda.   We   &apos; ^66are  satisfied   that,  if a  military Governor  is  not  appointed, a  civilian  Governorwill be  necessary,  whose  total  emoluments  cannot  well be  less  than  4,800  ayear,  out  of  which he would have to  defray the  salaries and expenses  of hisaide-de-camp and private secretary, and the wages of his  personal staff of servants, &amp;c.Lord  Passfield does  not consider that any contribution in  excess of that of  1,800,which  they now make, could be expected from the Colonial Government.   There wouldbe a saving of that part of the entertainment allowance which is now provided by the WarOffice,  and on the military aide-de-camp.   On the other hand, it would  be necessary toappoint an officer of the rank of colonel to command the garrison, who would have to beprovided with some entertainment allowance.  Army funds would also have to bear thecost of the half-pay of a lieutenant-general.     The financial result of the change would be an extra cost to the British taxpayer ofabout  1,850 per annum.     It is agreed  by  the  Colonial Office, the  War  Office  and  in  Bermuda that the discontinuance of  the present method  of filling the appointment would result in a loss ofImperial prestige.     We are therefore of the opinion that the appointment should remain as at pi&apos;esent.                                                                      P.                                                                      T.
