At the meeting of the Panel of Ministers on 21st October I under-took to collect evidence with regard  to  alleged  &quot; abuse &quot;  of theUnemployment Insurance Scheme.  The attached memorandum has accordingly been prepared, givingthe results  of enquiries made at a number of the EmploymentExchanges with regard to the receipt of benefit by  various classesof claimants in particular,  married women, short-time  and inter-intermittent workers, seasonal workers, and those in  receipt of transi-tional benefit.  I circulate the memorandum, in order  that my colleagues mayhave it before them when they finally decide the  question whetherthe Unemployment Insurance Bill shortly to be introduced is tobe confined to an  extension of borrowing  powers.   It  should benoted that very little time could be allowed for the  preparation ofthe memorandum and it should be regarded as being only a collectionof iUustrative examples and not an exhaustive picture.M. G. B.MINISTRY OF LABOUR,14th November, 1930(C2015) 80  11/30
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT.CLAIMS  BY MARRIED  WOMEN,  SEASONAL  WORKERS,               SHORT-TIME WORKERS, ETC.                      ILLUSTRATIVE CASES.  In view of allegations with regard to the circumstances in whichunemployment  benefit is  being  drawn in  certain classes  of cases(principally by married women, seasonal workers, and short-time orintermittent  workers, and under the &quot; transitional &quot;  conditions),the Department was instructed  to obtain reports  on  the  subjectfrom the Employment Exchanges.  Exhaustive enquiries have notbeen made,  both because  the  time  allowed was  very limited (theEmployment Exchanges had only two or  three days in which tofurnish the information) and because the object was not to compilecomplete statistical information  (such statistical  information as is available has already been furnished separately) but to collect asufficient number of concrete cases  which  might fairly be regardedas illustrative of a large number.  Most of the information came from 88 selected Exchanges, a list of which is given in Appendix 1 ;it will be seen that they are distributed over the whole country.  The following Memorandum makes selections from the informationthus collected, which in total occupies a  very much greater bulk.The cases sent up from which the selections have been  made werenot uniform in regard to the precise information they supplied, norin the form in which the reports were made.  This was due to the short time which was allowed for the forwarding of the information.Names of employers or claimants  are generally not given in theMemorandum, but can be supplied if necessary.  In  all the casesquoted benefit was actually being paid and, so far as appears fromthe facts given, was  being properly paid under the provisions of theUnemployment  Insurance Acts  as  interpreted in leading decisions.The cases are furnished as illustrating types of cases  to which public criticism has been directed on the  ground that they are &quot; abuses.&quot;Whether they or any of them are so or not is a matter of opinion and policy for the consideration of Ministers.                     I.  MARRIED  WOMEN.  It is alleged  that  many married  women are drawing unemploy-ment benefit although they have no intention of taking work.  It is not  possible  to produce  direct evidence with regard to the intentions of claimants, and  it is often  impracticable to apply the test of an offer of work, but there are facts from which an inferencemay be  drawn, and particularly such facts as their employmentrecord, industrial prospects, financial position or home ties.  Thereare cases where a good pre-marriage record  of employment is followedby a poor or even entirely negative post-marriage record.  In many areas and industries women are compelled to leave their employment on marriage and those claiming benefit have no chance of re-engage-ment locally except in office  cleaning or  daily domestic work forwhich they may be  unsuitable, even if sufficient  vacancies existed.There  are  also  married women claimants who on marriage  haveremoved to a district where either women are not normally employed,or their  particular industry is not  carried on, and where they are unlikely  to get the only type of work of which  they have knowledge.(On the other hand, there are trades and districts, e.g., the lancashire cotton Industry, in which it is  customary for women to remain inemployment after marriage.)   Even  where  married  women areordinarily employed in normal times; the financial circumstances ofmany who are  in receipt of benefit are such that they need not go out to work.  Finally, there are cases where  home ties render im-practicable  the  taking of  any work which is likely to be available.
  The increase among married women claimants to benefit since theearly part of this year has  been much greater in proportion thanthe  increase among single  women  claimants  as the  followingtable shows : 		Married.		Single.			Total.	N.W.	Other Divi-sions.	Total.	N.W.	Other Divi-sions.

It  is-estimated thatthe  total number of insured married women is not more  than30 per cent, of the total number of insured women ;  that is, thereare not more than 3 married women to every 7 single women in thetotal number of insured women.  That being so, the increase amongmarried  women,  if  proportionate  to  the increase  among  singlewomen, should have been not more than about 30,000.   In fact, itwas 109,809 over three times as many.  As the severe depression in the cotton textile trade has  inevitablycaused a  considerable increase  in  unemployment among  marriedwomen, it is of interest  to examine the  figures, excluding the North-Western Division, in which Lancashire is situated.   In  the  other divisions the increase among single  women was 36,654.  This being so,  the proportionate increase among married women should havebeen approximately 15,000 ;  in fact, it was 57,252, nearly four times as many.  Another illustration of the  disproportionate increase in  marriedwomen&apos;s  claims is furnished  by the  following  figures  from  theEdgware Road Exchange, where the women&apos;s live register, excludingpersons &quot; temporarily stopped,&quot; was : 23rd September, 192924th February, 193022nd September, 1930Single.  724  55SMarried.   417   601Total.  6931,1411,159  While the total register in September was about the same as inFebruary, the number of single women had  decreased  by 166, andthat of married women had increased by 184.  The  headings under which  cases  of married women may  beconsidered are : -    (a)  where the post-marriage  employment record is such as to&apos;         indicate little or no prospect of a resumption of insurable         employment (Appendix 2) ;    (b)  where the industrial prospects in the locality of residence         are such that further employment is unlikely (Appendix 3);    (c)  where the financial  position is such that the claimants do         not need work  (Appendix 4) ;    (d)  where home ties make  insurable employment difficult  or         impracticable (Appendix 5).  The instances  given in the appendices  are merely samples  to illustrate the types of cases in question. While the numbers involvedover the country as a whole cannot be stated, the reports receivedfrom  the 88 local offices consulted show  that there were manyhundreds of such cases at those offices.(2015 C)B2
                   II.  SEASONAL WORKERS.  The question raised in the  case  of seasonal workers is whetherthe circumstances in which they draw benefit outside their particular&quot; season&quot;  point  to  an  abuse of the  unemployment  insurancescheme.  They may be considered under three main heads, namely :      (a) Persons employed at seaside and other holiday resorts ;     (b) Fish curers ;     (c) Others, such as jam workers, mineral water workers, fruit         canners and persons emplo&apos;ed in local seasonal industries         such as toy making.Persons employed at Seaside and other Holiday Resorts.  Claimants included in this category are usually able to satisfy thefull first statutory  condition by virtue  of work during the season.(If  they normally would not do so, they may, by application, obtainexemption   from  paying  unemployment insurance contributions.)Owing to the scarcity of work outside the seasons in their homeareas and the difficulty in offering these claimants suitable work inother districts, it  is not easy to test their desire to obtain additional work in their  own.or other areas, or whether they are content withtheir usual earnings plus any unemployment benefit they may reqeive.Some examples of this type of case are shown in Appendix 6.Fish Curers.  The fish  curing season normally extends over a period of about30  weeks each year, being distributed as follows :      Winter fishing  off Scotland   . .    ..     ..     10 weeks.     Summer fishing off Scotland ..    ..     ..     10     East Anglian  season,  mid-October to mid-     10    ,,         December.     Odd weeks at Fleetwood, Hull, etc., coincident         with the main seasons.  It is estimated that there  are  about 1,700 fish workers in  the island of Lewis, and  of these some 450 obtain engagements for all three fishing seasons.  They generally have thirty weeks&apos; employmenteach year,  receiving  benefit for the  remaining  twenty-two weeks.Some  1,000 to 1,100 fishworkers obtain engagements for the summerfishing in Scotland and  the East  Anglian  season.  They generallyhave twenty  weeks&apos; work each year and draw benefit for  the re-mainder of  the year.   About 125 fish workers confine their work tothe Scottish winter and summer fishing seasons, and of these  lessthan 100 are able to satisfy the  first statutory condition.  Theremaining workers numbering about 50 are  employed at the summerfishing only.   The class  containing about 125 fish workers  aredisallowed  benefit  during the East Anglian season but can drawbenefit for  the remaining twenty-two weeks of  the year.  The  lastclass numbering about 50 are not regarded as eligible for transitional benefit.  It  is  not likely that they could satisfy the full first statutorycondition ;  even  if they can,  they are disallowed benefit in respectof  the East Anglian season.  The following further information with  regard  to  the  Island of&quot;Lewis shows  how  the numbers of men and women in  receipt ofbenefit in the Island have increased since July, 1929.   It should beremarked that in the  main the men  belong to an agricultural  and fishing community and there is little industrial work for them onthe Island.   The women in general follow  no industrial occupationother than that of seasonal fishworkers.   Some, but not all, &quot; follow the fish &quot; to East Coast ports and at present the season for this is on.	No. in Receipt of Benefit.				Date.	Men.	Women.	Boys.	Girls.

  The Umpire has held in the case of a woman fish kipperer residing in Stornoway that as she was willing to take such  work as was available locally between the fishing seasons, she was  entitled to benefit under the  Acts for the periods between the seasons  if shedid not obtain  employment, since she  was available for what localwork (other than kippering) there was.  It  was agreed that therewas  little work of any kind  available in Stornoway between theseasons.  The intervals amount to about six months.  (U.D.4663/30).  The local women fish workers at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoftare mainly immobile, averaging  about two months of this  work(mid-October to mid-December) each year.   The only other workthey are likely to  obtain is daily seasonal domestic work, which is roughly only available from June to September.  This means thatthese women may qualify for, and obtain benefit for, about  seven months each  year.  Examples of  this type  of case are shown in Appendix 7.Other  Seasonal  Workers,  including  jam workers,  mineral  waterworkers,  fruit  canners   and  persons  employed in local seasonal                 industries stick as toy making.  The seasonal wbrkers   employed in these  industries  are  oftenmarried women who are taken on during the rush seasons to augmentthe regular workers.  In most cases the  work is available only intowns, and, whilst  it cannot be said that other work is not availablebeyond the seasonal work, it is a fact that many of the persons whoare engaged during the rush season  do not obtain additional  work.  Examples of  this type  of case are shown in Appendix 8.         III.  SHORT-TIME and INTERMITTENT WORKERS.  This class can conveniently be treated under the following main headings:        (a) Systematic short-time ;       (b) Intermittent workers ;       (c) Other special classes.  As  regards systematic short-time, it  is well known that  this iscommonly  arranged so as to enable workers to qualify for  themaximum amount of benefit.  In some industries it is becoming asettled practice  to  arrange so that large numbers of workpeopleare regularly supported in part by the Unemployment Fund, and itis open to question whether the Fund was intended for that.  TradeUnions are alert to enter into negotiations  with  the  employers inthis connection.   Many firms  also appear to arrange their systemof work so that  the workpeople  can preserve continuity  under theten weeks part of the continuity  rule.   In some cases arrangements are made under which, though  the employees work  on the same number of clays as they would have done had there been no arrange-ment, the days are nevertheless so  grouped that  the  workers mayqualify for benefit (Appendix 9).  In other cases the work is crowdedinto fewer days with longer hours to enable benefit to be drawn onthe remaining da3?s (Appendix 10).  In some cases there are special arrangements for pooling wages and benefit (Appendix 11).  Under  the heading of intermittent workers there fall to be con-sidered dock workers generally  and special classes,  such as  coaltrimmers and dyers.  As regards dockers, reference may be madeto a report recently issued entitled &quot; Report of Enquiry into CasualLabour in the Mersey Side Area.&quot;   Generally, with  regard to dockers,the position is that evidence is being  given  to  the  Port LabourCommittee, which  is sitting under the chairmanship  of Sir DonaldMaclean, and that  that evidence is,  for the time being, confidential and not  available for  publication.   Criticism of the payment ofbenefit to certain classes of intermittent workers is based upon thefact that these classes can earn fairly high wages  in a short periodof employment.   Examples are  given in Appendix 12.
  There remain other classes of workers who, strictly speaking, areintermittent  workers,  but who are commonly distinguished fromthe more clearly defined classes such as dockers.  These less clearly defined intermittent  workers  comprise such  classes  as  week-endbarmen, shop assistants employed on Saturdays only, sandwichmen,and so on.   Examples are given in  Appendix 13.            IV. TRANSITIONAL BENEFIT  CLAIMANTS.  The main  criticism of payment of transitional benefit is basedupon the ground either that the claimant  does not really need thebenefit, or that he is not really in  the industrial field.  Examples ofthese two classes are given in Appendices 14 and 15 respectively ;but it will be observed  that  some of the  examples illustrate  bothclasses of case.  Generally, of course,  the Exchange has at presentlittle or no knowledge of the claimants&apos; other means.  It is to be  remarked that between February and July of this year the number of persons in receipt of transitional benefit increased by160,000-from  140,000 to over 300,000.  Of this increase  50,000came from the poor law ; the other 110,000 are,, for the most  part,persons who were not in receipt of benefit or of poor relief, either because they were disqualified or because they had not applied for it.Moreover, not only has the number of persons in receipt of transi-tional benefit increased, but the proportion of them who have paidfew or no contributions has substantially increased also, as follows : -Percentage of Total Number of Persons in Receipt of Transitional  Benefit           who paid few Contributions in the past Two Years.No. of Contributions	0		5-9.October, 1929 ......	17-3	S-2	9-7May, 1930 ........	31-7	12-5	13-8Increase in Percentage	14-4	4-3	4-1                      V. MISCELLANEOUS.  There  are  a number of other classes of case to  which attentionmight be directed.  They fall under the headings of :      (a)  Cases of doubtful industrial capacity (Appendix 16) ;     (b)  Pensioners, etc. (Appendix 17) ;     (c)  Persons in Subsidiary occupations (Appendix 18).

Aged 24 ;  terminated S-J-  years&apos;  employment with tobacco andcigarette  manufacturers, in June,  1928;  claim lodged  11th June, 1930.  Registered for employment as a cleaner. Is a skilled cigaretteworker, but there  is  no prospect  of further employment in this industry  as the manufacture of cigarettes is only carried on by  herprevious  employer in this district, and the firm has  a rule that all women workers  have to leave  their employment upon marriage.There is  no prospect of placing her as a cleaner owing to the factthat she  is inexperienced and the  existence of  a large number ofwomen with experience.
   Aged 19 ;  terminated 4 years&apos; employment in March, 1929 ;  claimlodged 16th June, 1930.  This claimant is registered as a cardboardboxmaker, but has little hope of absorption as married women arenot generally employed in the trade.   Aged 27 ;  terminated 11 years&apos; employment in December, 1928 ;claim lodged  18th March,  1930.   Registered  for employment ascleaner or soap stamper.  With regard to cleaners&apos; work, the remarkscontained in the last case but one  above will also apply here, andthere is no prospect of employment as a soap stamper, as marriedwomen are not employed in the trade.   Aged 26 ;  terminated 10  years&apos; employment in March,  1926 ;claim made 29th September, 1930.   Registered  for employment ascleaner or boxmaker.  The remarks contained in the previous cases will also apply here.   In all the above cases it will be observed that the claimants leftpermanent  employment to  be  married  and have  performed  noemployment since  marriage.  In all these  cases the women haveexperience of work which is wholly or mainly carried on  by their previous employers and this experience is of little value  to other-firms.Kingswood.   M.W.B.23.   Aged 24 ;  married ;  employed  at  chocolate manufacturers for7  years to 4th May, 1928 ;  left on marriage under rule of the firm ;no employment  since marriage.   Aged 23 ;  married ;  employed  at chocolate  manufacturers for9  years to 11th April, 1929 ; left on marriage under rule of the firm ;no employment  since marriage.   Aged 24;  married;  employed 9 years to 20th August,  1929 ;left on marriage on 24th August, 1929 ; no employment since.   Aged 30 ; married ;  employed at tobacco firm 16 years to  12 April,1930 ;  left on marriage on 12 April, 1930 under rule  of the firm ;no employment  since marriage.   There are approximately 140 of such cases on the register  at thepresent time, and  as  their old employers do not employ marriedwomen there is no prospect whatever of their obtaining employment,having regard to the circumstances of the district.Coatbridge.   The WhoUy Unemployed Women&apos;s Register at present is  made upof 280 women and 90 young persons.  Of these, 144 women and ISyoung persons are married.   There are 45  married women on theRegister who left work to  be married,  and  who are considered un-likely again  to  obtain insurable  employment,  owing either to thefact that  married women are not employed or because employersprefer single women, of whom there are always likely to be a sufficientsupply available.Barnsley.   Report shows that  out  of a  total  of 329  wholly  unemployedmarried women  235 have not worked since marriage.  These womengenerally leave  their work on marriage and there is no  possibilityof the absorption of most of them in the  Barnsley area, even  ifindustry, at  present depressed, were normal.  Family  ties preventtransfer to other districts.
                     MARRIED  WOMEN.Where the industrial prospects  in  the locality of residence are  such              that further  employment is unlikely.New Ferry.  M.W.B.1.  The  principal employer in this  area  does  not employ  marriedwomen, and there are 87 such women signing.  The prospects of placing them are negligible.Blackpool. M.W.B.2.  There  are  six women here who have  previously been textile^workers  in another  district.  They  will get  no textile work inBlackpool.Bootle.  M.W.B.3.  Of 2,642 women on the Register 40 per cent, are married.  Theonly openings in the area for married women are occasional domesticjobs.Bridgeton.  M.W.B.4.  There  are 112 cases of married women previously employed byfirms who will not engage married women save in extreme pressure.Coatbridge.   M.W.B.5.  Generally speaking, there is very little employment available for married women in this district and  when  a  woman gives up herwork  to be married  she has not much prospect of again being employed in insurable employment.  Exceptions may be made intrades  where there is a shortage of workers seasonally (e.g., tailor-esses),  but this  affects very few persons.Edinburgh.  M.W.B.6.  A woman, aged 24. was married 22nd December, 1929.   Employedwith iron foundry in Falkirk for  10  years up to date of marriage.No prospect of  work in this area.  There  are 104 cases on the Register which appear to come underthis heading.   The majority  of these were employed in the printing and rubber works and also in shops.Glasgow.  M.W.B.7.  Shop assistant left employment on 28th April, 1929, to be married ;no  prospects of re-employment except  possibly at sale seasons ;husband a corporation employee.  Clerk left employment in  September,  1929, to be married,  after8 years with one firm ; has no prospects  of re-employment.  There are a number of such cases.Glasgow  (South Side).   M.W.B.8.  Tobacco worker, aged 26, worked 12 years to July, 1929 ; marriedJuly, 1929.  Firm do not employ married women.  Thread worker ;  aged 28 years ;  last worked August,  1922, to july,  1929;  married July,   1929.  Firm  do  not employ marriedwomen.  Shorthand-typist;  aged 26; last employed to 6th September,1929 ;  married 20th September, 1929.  Firm do not employ marriedwomen.Hamilton.  M.W.B.9.  There are cases of married women working  as carpet weavers andjute workers in other areas taking up residence in this area.  Thereare no employments of these descriptions here, and they accordinglydraw benefit in an area where there is no  work for them.
Kilmamock.  M.W.B.10.  Employed 5&amp; years to 31st December, 1929; married January,1930 ;  household duties January till March, 1930 ;  sick, March to5th May, 1930 ; claimed 6th May, 1930 ;  former employment closedto married women.,  Employed A\ years to 25th February, 1930 ; married 14th March,1930 ;  claim made  19th March, 1930 ; employment definitely closedto married women.

Last employed as a level crossing gate-keeper with the L.N.E.R.in Alloa ;  came to Coatbridge when her husband was transferred ;absolutely no prospects of ever getting work of this kind again.  Last employed in a shop ; worked short time after marriage, but has had no employment since January, 1926.  Worked after marriage but left prior to birth of first child ;  hasnot worked since July, 1929, and no prospects of re-employment inold  industry.   (Six cases on the register somewhat similar.)  Employed since marriage but dispensed with when marriage  wasdisclosed, owing to a rule of the firm not to employ married women.(Four cases of this type.)Edinburgh.  M.W.B.12.  A woman aged 20 was married 4th April, 1930 ;  worked with oldemployer up  to 3rd July,  1930.  Firm do not re-engage  marriedwomen.  No other  firm in same line in area.  Note. There are 73 cases on the register who appear to come underthis category, i.e., rubber workers, printing trades&apos; employees, shop assistants, etc.  Married women  are not  normally employed in the printing trade or in the- rubber works, where they are only  engagedfor  rush periods and are dispensed  with  as soon as possible.   this applies also to shop assistants and clerical workers.Glasgow.   M.W.B.13.  Woman  married 12th July, 1928;  continued employment inprinting trade until 29th November, 1928 ; has had no employmentsince;  little prospect of re-instatement as married women are not as a general rule taken back into this trade.  There are a few cases similar to this.Paisley.  M.W.B.16.  The  principal employers of women are Messrs. Coats and  Co.,  andMessrs. Clark and Co.,  Thread Manufacturers. The  rule  at  bothestablishments is that women employees must resign on marriage,and married women are not employed.  The rule is relaxed in excep-tional circumstances only.  The general position in the area is  thata negligible percentage may be  retained  in their employment on marriage and only a similar percentage of those whose employmentterminates on marriage have any prospect of subsequent regular employment.  Immediately prior to the  1930 Act the total numberof married women  on the  Wholly Unemployed Register was  143.The likely figure as at 25th October, 1930 was 617 an increase of474.  In addition the number of married  women on  the TemporaryStoppages and Non-Claimants&apos; Files on 25th October, 1930, was 98and 53 respectively.Kinning Park.  M.W.B.17.  There are 92 women on the Register at this Exchange who have worked since  marriage but  have  no prospect of  re-employment.In most of the cases claimants have worked only a few weeks aftermarriage.Willington Quay.   M.W.B.18.  The main  avenue of employment for women is  at the  RoperyWorks.  The  employers, however, dismiss women workers on marriage.  The women claim unemployment benefit and register asdaily domestics, etc., in addition to their normal occupation.  There
is little or no employment of  this description in Wellington Quay,and, consequently, the women  have practically no  prospects  ofemployment  either insurable or uninsurable.   Typical case is  asfollows :   Aged 31 ;  employed for 14 years at the Ropery,  and dischargedin June, 1929.  Applicant did not claim benefit until 24th June,1930, when the claim was referred to the Court of Referees on thequestion of availability.  The Court allowed the claim and applicanthas now received 98 days&apos; benefit.Bradford.   M.W.B.18a.  Aged 23;   wood machinist;   resigned work March,  1930, on marriage.   Late firm  sole employers  in Bradford of women woodmachinists.  Aged 46 ;  burler and mender ; last worked April,  1928 ;  husband dyer&apos;s labourer, in work ; physical impairment precludes employ-men t on  domestic work ;  has been  submitted to ten employersunsuccessfully ;  among obstacles are age and limited experience.  Aged 56 ;  waitress  ; last worked 5 months to September,  1928,in cafe ;   age serious  obstacle in view of  large field of youngercandidates.  Aged 27 ;  pin-setter;   last worked December, 1929 ; was em-ployed prior  to recent marriage by the only firm known to employwomen pin-setters  ; no prospect of re-engagement by old firm, and prospects  elsewhere considered negligible.  Aged 21 ;  drawer ;  has three children, last worked August, 1927 ;drew benefit up to  16th October, 1930.  In face of domestic circum-stanc.es, and  a large field  of single women unemployed, prospects of re-engagement negligible.North Eastern.  M.W.B.18c.  A woman  claimant had been employed for thirteen years  toEaster, 1930, as secretary at  a colliery company.  The applicantresigned her  employment at  Easter in order to get married.  six weeks after that date she  lodged a claim to benefit.   She is unwilling to leave  the  district  on  account of the  fact  that  she is married.There is little opportunity of placing the applicant in this area,  eventhough she is prepared to take any t3&apos;pe of clerical work.North  Eastern.  M.W.B.19.  Aged 28 ; general clerk;  left work on marriage in November, 1929,and has not worked since ; did not register until 30th June, 1930 ;has  no prospect of re-engagement  with  her old firm, who do notemploy married women,  and  poor prospects  of employment  else-where  in this district  in her own occupation, as married clerks areseldom employed locally.  Aged 28;  milk  round ; left work on  marriage in  March, 1929,and no work since ;  disallowed  as  &quot; not genuinely seeking work &quot;in June and again  in July, 1929 ;  now drawing benefit under tran-transitional conditions, and registered as charwoman ;  there is a greatsurplus of charwomen on this register.  Aged 61 ;  tobacco  cutter ;  worked 28 years up  to  15th March,1930 ;  no prospect of re-engagement either with old firm  or  withany other tobacco  firm in district, all of which rarely employ marriedwomen ;  not likely to be able to change her occupation.Lincoln.  M.W.B.20.  Aged 26 ;   letter-press  feeder ; left her work at  Manchester  on marriage  ; came  to  Lincoln  3rd August,  1929;  no  work since junly,  1929,  and unlikely to  obtain  any in  Lincoln, as printingworks  here do not employ married women.Kingswood.   M.W.B.22.  Aged 22 ;  married ; employed at chocolate manufacturers 7 years to  10th January,  1930 ;   left  on  marriage under rule of the firm ;returned to work on 6th  October, 1930, for a few weeks during rushperiod for Christmas  trade.   Aged 26; married ;  employed at chocolate manufacturers 10-i years to 30th April, 1929 ;  left on  marriage, 30th April,  1929, under rule of  the firm ;  returned 26th August, 1929, to 28th November, 1929,
and again on 5th October,  1930, for rush, periods  for Christmastrade.  This firm do not employ married women, but occasionallyoffer employment for a few weeks to. some of their old employees,who have left on marriage under the firm&apos;s rule excluding marriedwomen, during a busy period, i.e.,  Easter or Christmas,  for thepurpose of coping with  a special  demand for their commodities.Overtime is worked at such periods and by employing these women who  have had experience, engagement of additional staff is not necessary.  Apart from these short periods of employment  there isno prospect  whatever of re-employment with their old firm.  this applies to approximately 20 cases.Washwood Heath.  M.W.B.24.  At Washwood Heath there are approximately 100 married womenclaimants who have worked since marriage, and who have little chance of re-employment.  Seventeen of them are similar to thefollowing examples:   Married; husband working;  2  children,  (2^-years 11 months) ;has only done 4 months&apos; work  since 1927,  and none since  birth  of second child ;  lives in own home ;  capstan operator.  Married ;  husband working ;  5 children  (3 under 14) ; has beenill for 4 months since August,  1928, and since that  date has onlyworked 2 days per week for 4 weeks ; lives in own home ;  hand pressworker.Selly Oak.

Claimantpreviously employed as a jute worker in Dundee for  approximately7 years.  Her husband obtained work in this district, and the homewas  accordingly transferred to  Birmingham.  No  possibility  ofobtaining employment  in  this district  as a  jute preparer ;  alsounlikely  to obtain  other employment owing to  domestic responsi-bilities and lack of any experience such as would be required.Hartley.  M.W.B.26.  In the Potteries a very large  proportion of the registers of all theExchanges consists of married women.  At Hanley, where the position may be regarded as typical, there isa tendency among the  pottery firms to  discharge women  over  21receiving  the  fuU rate  of pay.   These women are replaced  byjuveniles.  The only employment likely to  be available  for  thedisplaced women appears to  be for odd  days when  the  ovens are drawn.  There are  183 of these cases at Hanley..  Typical examples are as follows :   Aged 37 ;  glost sorter,  13 years to 1925 ; then 1 year to February,1928.  Aged 38;  glost sorter, 14 years to 1927; 5 odd days to October,1928.  Aged 39 ;  biscuit warehouse ; 23 years to January, 1927.Burslem.  M.W.B.27.  The married women drawing  benefit at Burslem who have workedsince marriage, constitute a large proportion of the register.  Examples are :   Aged 55 ;  Glost selector ;  no work since September, 1928. Owingto trade  custom  of employing  young women, has little prospect ofwork.  Aged 40 ; biscuit warehouse  hand ; at home from 1920 to 1924;worked in 1924  because husband unemployed ; worked to 1926 ;left owing to husband&apos;s illness ; at home until April, 1930 ; benefitallowed by Court of Referees ; no likelihood whatever of work.

Aged 48 ;  packer in laundry until marriage, April,  1929 ;  worked3 weeks to  August, 1929;  lives 6 miles from exchange.  Locallaundries do not employ married women.  .  Aged 55 ;  trouser hand ;  unemployed  10 years  to  May, 1928;employed for  few short periods during  busy seasons since ;  no prospect of regular work.Leicester.  M.W.B.29.  In Leicester  there are 75 claimants who have no  prospect of re-employment.  Tj&apos;pical cases are as follows :   Aged 56;  employed  14 years to May,  1929, as spinner ; onlywork since, 5 days cleaning a school; now states &quot;scrubbing worktoo heavy &quot;.  Aged 55 ;  employed for 43 years to April,  1929, as wool  reeler ;since unemployed.  Aged 52;   Griswold  machine operator;  recent employment months to  November,  1929;  at home previously.   Griswoldmachine now out of date.Aston.   M.W.B.30.  At Aston there are over 50 married women registered for warehousework who have done no work since marriage, and for whom  it isconsidered there is little  or no prospect of employment.Birmingham.  M.W.B.31.  Aged 26 ;  factory worker (cocoa  and chocolate) ; married ; nochildren ;  husband employed as a chocolate moulder ;  occupationfor which registered, chocolate overlooker ; alternative  occupation,daily cleaner ;  employed for 11-J- years to 18th October, 1929, leavingon marriage ; no employment since ; no prospect of being re-absorbed into industry and very  little prospect of obtaining daily cleaning.Her former employers are not prepared to retain or re-engage marriedwomen, under normal circumstances.  Under abnormal circumstancesmarried women have been re-engaged, but only on a purely tem-porary  basis,  and this  had happened only once during the last3  years, when a number of married women were re-engaged for  aperiod of  approximately 13 weeks.Btirslem.  M.W.B.33.  There are at Burslem approximately 200  married  women  whohave little chance of obtaining regular employment.  Examples are as follows :   Aged 26 ;  glost warehouse worker ;  employed fairly regularly tomarriage in  1929.:  Aged  21 ; biscuit  warehouse  worker;  7 years to  1929;  no prospect of re-absorption.

Aged 23 ;  glost warehouse for 7  years to 1928 ; then 1 year and months to August, 1930 ;  assistant nurse in Poor Law Institution ;dismissed on marriage.
Birmingham.  M.W.B.34.  In the Greater Birmingham area there are elderly married workers,hand press workers, jewel warehouse workers, etc., who, if they fallout of employment for any reason, are not reinstated, although their period of employment with one firm may be of many years&apos; duration.Their places are rilled by young applicants..  These elderly women  are not suitable for any other work and areseldom domesticated.  The number signing at Sparkhill is 126.  The following are typical of those registered at Birmingham :   Aged 57 ; has worked for 17 years with one firm as a pen raiser ;was employed on short time from  30th  August, 1930  until 15thSeptember, 1930, and then discharged.   It is not likely that shewill be re-employed owing to her age.  Aged 55 ; french polisher ; worked for 23 years to February, 1930,when she left on account of sickness.   Little chance of re-absorptionexcept in a very temporary capacity.  Aged 57 ;  worked for 36 years as pen turner, to March, 1930 ;left on account of&apos; illness ; little chance of re-absorption.  Aged 60 ;  hand press worker employed for 11 or 12 years ; lefton  2nd June, 1930.  It is  unlikely that  she  will be able to obtainwork on a hand press  again  on account of  her age.  Employers,once they have been compelled to  discharge their older workers,rarely re-engage them. Wales. M.W.B.35.  It is understood that  in accordance with the Trade Union practice,women working in the printing trade are on marriage required to relinquish  their employment and, in so far as they are members of a Trade Union in the industry, receive a dowry when terminatingemployment in such circumstances.  The Trade Union  procedure, agreed with the employers, e.g., in  the Cardiff district, is that, solong as there are unmarried women  suitable and available for work in  the  trade,  the re-engagement after marriage of women formerly so  employed is precluded. Bath.  M.W.B.36.   There are 18 to 20 women claimants who previously were employed as  silk weavers at Kemp Bros., Shepton Mallet.  They were employed by this firm until June, 1928, when the factory closed down and so far as can be seen there is no possibility of the industry recommencing in  that area.   Nine of the women concerned  are married ; of these, eight have done no work at all since the closing of the works, whereas the ninth has only performed one day&apos;s work per week (i.e., private washing).   These women had been disallowed benefit, but reclaimed in  March,  1930.

Here there are a considerable number of women claimants who have breast-fed babies  and are therefore  only  available for work within easy reach of their homes so that they can get home for the midday meal.   During the period of natural feeding they are not likely to  obtain employment. Willington Quay.  M.W.D.4.

                  SHORT-TIME WORKERS.(1) Where short-time working is  so arranged that the workers  may    claim for the remaining days, under the  three-in-six rule.Midlands.  S.T.1.  A branch manager reports that the employees of the local collierieshad worked practically without  a break during the past 3-J- years&apos;depression in the coal-mining industry, but in  June last the workingtime was reduced to 4 days a week.  Subsequently, this short-time working  was so  arranged as to enable  the men  to  qualify forunemployment benefit, and  at  the present time the method is towork 5 days one week and 3 days the next, thereby ensuring 4 days&apos;benefit per fortnight.  This arrangement  was made as a result of representations by the workers.Midlands.  S.T.2.  An iron company have continuously for the last 6 years so arrangedtheir work as to allow their employees to receive benefit each week.At their colliery  the work has been so arranged  for the last  2 yearsthat every shift  not worked, including Saturday afternoon, whichis not normally a working day, has been a day in respect of whichbenefit is payable.North- Western.   S.T.3.  A firm have arranged to close down on  a Saturday and Monday,followed by Friday and Saturday, in order that the emploj&apos;ees mayqualify for benefit under the three-in-six  rule.  The workers com-plained to the firm previously that they could  not draw benefit whenstopped regularly on a Saturday and Monday.Scotland.  S.T.4.  A preserve  manufacturer,  employing approximately 20  people,put practically the whole on 3 days per week.  The employer statedthat he arranged the short-time system so  that his employees wouldnot  suffer serious  financial loss and so that they would  be paid&quot; a little of the money &quot; he had paid into  the Fund.^2) Where  arrangements  are made to preserve continuity  under the     10 weeks&apos; rule and so avoid a further waiting period.Midlands.   S.T.5.   On 16th October, 1930, approximately 100 workpeople employedby a colliery resumed  signature of the register on the 60 th day ofa spell of employment, thereby ensuring continuity under the second part of the continuity rule.  The claimants  concerned last provedunemployment on  6th August  and again signed  the register on 16th, 18th, 20th and 21st October. This period of unemployment, inaddition to maintaining continuity  under the  second part of  the rule,  will have the  effect of qualifying the  workpeople concerned for benefit during the forthcoming Christmas holiday.Midlands.   S.T.6.   A glass firm by their short-time arrangements, work in  order to preserve continuity and to enable some of their workpeople to obtain the maximum amount of unemployment benefit.  It is arranged for two groups of workers to work for approximately 9 weeks and then to sign for the 10th week in place of other employees who return towork on that week.  Approxirhately 20 employees are involved in this firm in each relay.  They employ  about  200 workpeople.  The arrangement referred to above only applies to the two batches of 20 in one particular department.
Midlands.  S.T.7.  A particular firm  closed down for an extended week&apos;s holidayfrom 16th August, 1930, to 1st September, 1930.   The firm informed the Exchange  that they had been working five days  per week and owing to reduction in business they would be closed for an extendedChristmas and  New Year holiday, and as the workpeople had alread3&apos;put in their waiting period during  the week&apos;s  holiday, the firmintended stopping some time during October in  order to  preservecontinuity of unemployment.  They subsequently  closed from the23rd to 25th October, inclusive.   Benefit will be payable throughoutthe extended stoppage at Christmas and New Year.Blackburn.   S.T.7A.  A mill stopped on Friday, 4th July, instead of  on 5th  July, sothat their empkyees could  qualify for benefit  for the  BlackburnHolidays 19th to  26th  July inclusive.   By stopping  on Fridaynight instead of noon on Saturday, there were 12 days of  unemploy-ment before the holidays and 76 of their employees qualified  for anadditional 7 days&apos; benefit.  The same firm closed down on Friday, 24th October.  A telephoneenquiry was received at the Exchange asking if the  period would be within 10 weeks  of  the  last stoppage.  The last  day within the10 weeks&apos; rule would have been 27th October.
WORK  PERFORMED IN FEWER DAYS BUT WITH LONGERHOURS  TO  ENABLE  BENEFIT  TO BE DRAWN  FOR THE                     REMAINING DAYS.Midlands.  S.T.8.  A firm of glove manufacturers have  recently placed the  workers on short-time, and it is understood that sufficient work to occupy a normal worker 3 days is allotted to each person.  Some of the workersbeing quicker than others, complete their work in 2 days, and thusare able to qxialify for benefit for 4 days per week instead of 3 days.North-Eastern.  S.T.9.  A  large number of  registered  wharf and registered  unattachedworkers at a North-Eastern port are working double shifts on somedays ; one shift from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. is paid for at single rate, andthe second shift,  from 3  p.m. to midnight is paid for at the rate oftime and a half.   The total earnings for that day are approximately 2. A test was made by  examination of the books of registered menwho  received unemployment benefit on the 22nd February, 1930.Thirty-four of these men  out of 144 worked from one to three doubleshifts in a week and were able to receive unemployment benefit.Those who worked one double shift  were able to receive up  to5 days benefit ;  those who worked two double shifts, up to 4 daysbenefit,  and those who  worked three  double  shifts, up to 3 daysbenefit.
     SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS  FOR POOLING  WAGES                       AND  BENEFIT.North-western.  S.T.15.    Only a few cases are reported  where wages are  pooled, but itis unlikely that Exchanges would  have full information  of thesecases.  It is reported from one area that approximately 400 menin the district who  are engaged in dye houses and are paid by piecework have an arrangement with their employers under which the employed men pool their wages with the unemployment insurance benefit (other than dependants&apos; benefit) and share  it  with  theirunemployed fellow  workers.  The  workmen are, it  is understoodmembers  of  a society, but the  society is not a  party to thearrangement.Scotland.  S. T. 16.  A pooling system is reported in respect of coal hoistmen.  Thereare  five regular squads (24 in each squad) or a total of 120.  Thereis a pooling system in operation whereby a contractor receives cashfor  shipments from the railway company   He  allocates to eachsquad foreman the amount due to the squad in wages   The squadforeman in turn distributes to each individual workman.   By thissystem it means that whether or not  the  five squads are fully employed, each member of each squad receives a payment pro rata.of the amount paid by the railway company in respect of  the totalshipments.  In effect, members of squads who are employed either for  a full  week or  part of a week receive a share of the pool, plusunemployment benefit ; and in the slack season members of twoor three squads who are not working receive not only their shareof the  pool  but also unemployment benefit.  It is estimated that under the pool system coal hoistmen receive on an average not lessthan  5 a week and, in addition, unemployment benefit in respectof days when they are  unemployed.
WORKERS RECEIVING HIGH  WAGES  ON  INTERMITTENTSHORT-TIME OR CASUAL EMPLOYMENT, AND ALSO DRAWING                          BENEFIT.North  Eastern.  S.T.10.   Steel workers earning  6 10s. for 4 days&apos; work and receive 2 days&apos;benefit by arrangement of the non-working days, so that  in eachfortnight there are 3 days of unemployment in 6 consecutive days.   Steel workers earning  A 17s. Ad. for 3 days&apos; work and receiving3 days&apos; benefit.   Steel workers earning  2 3s. Ad. for 2 days&apos; work and receiving4 days&apos; benefit.  Numerous other cases  occur in  the same area ;  approximately80  earn   A  for  3  days&apos; work and qualify for 3 days&apos; benefit ;180 earn  3 and they receive 3 days&apos; benefit, and 40 earn  2 and receive 3 days&apos; benefit weekly.North  Eastern.  S.T.11,  Foy Boatmen.  Average employment obtained  is 31 days out of 77.  The  average earnings being  3 to  5 per week, and, in addition, money is earnedby conveying officers and seamen and their baggage to ships at piersat all hours. There is no fixed staff for this, and complaints are madeas to excessive charges. At night the ferry service only runs hourly,and the Foy boatmen  use their boats to  bring wayfarers across theriver, and thus make additional money.North Eastern.  S. T.12.  Coal trimmers work  regularly  2 or 3 days each week and  claimbenefit in respect of the remaining days.  The work is highly paid,the earnings amounting to as much as  5,  6 or  7  per  day of24 hours.North Eastern.  S.T.13.  There  are  about  500 temporarily  suspended  12-hour  shiftworkers in the local dyeing industry.  The normal working week isone of 4 days,  equalling 48 hours, but under the short-time arrange-ments, the  full 12-hour shifts  are  frequently not  worked  and benefit is, therefore, payable for the  days on which  no work  isperformed.  The earnings range from 12s. to  1 per shift, and thefollowing examples show the effect on the Unemployment Fund ofthe short-time working arrangement :     Case 1. Hours worked 33\ in 3 days.  Benefit total 3 days.    Case 2. Hours worked 22 in 2 days.  Benefit total 4 days.    Case 3. Hours worked 33J in 4 days.  Benefit total 2 days (by              arranging work so  that in  each fortnight there are              3 days&apos; unemployment in 6 consecutive days).NorthWestem.  S.T.14.  Employment at local lairages is by gangs, 1 foreman and 4 menwho work on Fridays,  Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays each week.On ordinary occasions cattle  are killed on Saturdays. The men are paid by piece  and the  money earned is  paid to the foreman, whodistributes  it  to the men according to  the  particular  operationperformed.  The weekly average earnings for the year in the case oftwo gangs  were   26 7s. 2d. and   26 2s.  3d   The men have  to beavailable from 6  a.m.  to 5  p.m. on each  working day, but thenumber of  hours  worked varies  with the number of cattle to bekilled.  When work is performed on Saturday no  benefit  can bedrawn  for Wednesday and Thursday.  The employers in this casecontend that the men have done a full week&apos;s work in each  weekduring the past year.  The firms  consider that it is an abuse of theUnemployment Fund to pay benefit.
        Casual, Week-End,  and Single Day Employees.  Numbers of claimants are  working one or two days each week,thus obtaining contributions, but they have apparently no prospectof full-time employment.  In some cases the workers have beencasually  employed for  a number  of years, and  were disallowedbenefit prior to March, 1930.  Cases quoted under this heading are numerous and  varied ;  they may  be classed as follows :       (1)  Part-time workers with Woolworths and similar stores.      (2)  Market  stall workers.      (3)  Market  porters and  cattle drovers.      (4)  Sandwich men, bill distributors, circular folders, etc.      (5)  Auctioneers&apos; assistants, furniture  removers.      (6)  Night watchmen.      (7)  Miscellaneous.  (1) Cases of Woolworths and other stores for week-end assistantsare  reported from all  Divisions, and  at 45 London Exchanges,117 women and girls were noted to be so employed.  In the provincesreports indicate that the  amount of wages  for the week-end, plus the  unemployment benefit, is often equal  to the average  weeklywage of similar shop assistants.   The following are examples : Salford.  S.T.19.  A claimant, a woman,  had been disallowed twice by the Courtof Referees as  not normally in  insurable employment.   Has sincehad one  day&apos;s work weekly at  Woolworths, and is  thus able to qualify for benefit.Gloucester.  S. T.20.  A woman, aged  18, single; employed  at  Woolworths  one  dayweekly since  March, 1929, has  not worked anywhere  else  sinceleaving school, and has no immediate prospects of being permanentlyemployed by the firm.

Receives  14s. wages, plus benefit forthe other four days.  There are numerous other cases at practically every Exchange.  (2) Many cases of market stall workers are reported, of which thefollowing  are  typical: Hinkley.   S.T.23.  Young man, aged 33;  worked  as dyers&apos; sorter seven years  up to august, 1927.  Now erects stalls in market  on Mondays, and sellsevening papers as subsidiary employment.   Draws benefit  5 daysper week almost continuously.Burslem.   S.T.24.  Widow, aged 52; fruiterers&apos; assistant  13 years to September, 1928.Since then has been employed Saturdays  only, and drawing benefit for the remainder of the  week.

Earns  1 to 1 5s., plus an allowance of meat (value 9s.) and U.I. benefit  1 Is. 4d.  (3)  Many examples of market porters and cattle drovers employed for only one or two days a week have been noted at market townsin the provinces.  The following are examples : Gloucester.  S.T.26.  Man, aged 43; has drawn 228 days benefit since the 7th December,1929,  in respect of himself, wife and 5 children.  During this periodhe has worked 45 ordinary days as a market porter.Salisbury.  S.T.27.  Man, aged 58;  has received benefit for 143 days since the date ofhis claim and  has been employed 109 days as a cattle drover and market porter.  This man&apos;s record as a market porter and droveris known to extend  back for at least 26 years.  There is no record of his having had any other type of employment.Worcester.  S.T.28.  Man, aged 45 ;  was a greengrocer on his own account until March,192S.   Since then he has been mainly employed one day a  week as a market porter, and in receipt of benefit for the  remainder of the week.Dundee.   S.T.28a.  There are seven cattle drovers who work one day per week.   one man has had  no other employment for 12 years and another for10 years.  Benefit is being paid for five days per week  and thefirst Statutory Condition  is always satisfied.  (4)  Cases of  sandwich men and bill distributors who have workedonly one day a week  have been reported from most Divisions.   In one case the claimant has done no ordinary work since 1922, and anothersince  1924. At Keighley a claimant who has not had a continuousspell of work for many years past is now doing a spell of one day aweek, thus securing a contribution for each  week.   In at  least sixcases  at Huddersfield,  the claimants are known to arrange among themselves to  take  employment as sandwich  men  in  rotation ofone day  per  week,  in order to secure sufficient  contributions to qualify for benefit.Leicester.  S.T.29.  Man, aged 51, single  ; no regular work, other than sandwich man and bill distributor, for  the last 15 years.  Has been on  and offbenefit for many years.Handley.  S.T.30.  Man ; aged  63 ; no  regular work since 1920;  obtains one day&apos;work  each week as sandwich man.Worksop.   S.T.31.  Man who was an engine driver 35 years up to 1925 ; now doesordinary duties distributing handbills, thus  qualifying  for benefit.  (5)  The following is an example of  an  auctioneers assistantworking one or two  days  a week.Worksop.   S.T.32.  Man ; aged 36 ; seven children ;  haulage hand and rabbit catcherand labourer up to  1928 ; now works one  or two days per week inauctioneer^ saleroom,  and thus is  able to qualify for benefit forremaining days.  (6)  Many cases of watchmen employed at  night  or week-endshave been reported.
 S.T.33.   A week-end watchman  beginning  work on  Saturday at 1p.m. and working continuously until 7 a.m. the following Monday is paid 10s. 5d. per shift, a total of  2 Is.  8d. for the job ; claims and receives benefit in respect of Tuesday to Friday weekly, thus receiving total income of  3 18s. each week. S.T.34.   Man ; aged 40 ;  married ;  train driver for 10 years to October, 1928; since then has had. casual employment (two or three nights per week) as night watchman, earning an average of  14s. per week ; wife working, average earnings 28s. per week.  Approximately 12 other corporation night watchmen in  similar circumstances.   (7) The miscellaneous group includes shop assistants,  collectors, bar-generals, bakers, printers,  musicians, waiters, waitresses,  boot repairers, professional footballers, etc.  Examples under this heading are : Burslem.  S.T.35.   Man ;  married ; aged 55 ; has collected 2 days a week for provi- dent clothing club for past 13 years, receives benefit for 4 days a week ;  has no  prospects  and has no  desire  to  obtain  full-time employment. Oldbury.  S.T.36.   Married woman ;  aged  28 ;  worked  as  bar-general for 5 years to June, 1930 ;  now works Saturdays only and qualifies for benefit remainder of the week. Walsall.   S.T.37.   Man ;  aged 62 ; baker ;  has worked  1 day per week for the past 4 years ; receives benefit for the remainder of the week. Leicester.  S. T.38.  Woman ;  aged 57 ;  was employed  full-time with a printer until March, 1930 ;  now works one or two days a week as required folding circulars.  There are four or five similar cases  of the same firm of printers. Bradford.  S.T.39.  Man ; registered as a musician ;  works each Saturday as a musician for 5s. ; qualifies for benefit remainder of the week. Cradley Heath.   S.T.40.  Married woman ;  aged 24 ;  has worked as a japanner 2 days per week for the past 3 years ; no chance of full-time employment  and appears content  with 2 days per week.  From a report from the North-Western Division it seems that the Rugby Football Club  has now revised the  agreements  with  the players.  This system of clubs appears to have adopted a standard form of agreement, in which there is contained no express or implied condition as to training.  The effect of this agreement is to restrict the following of occupations to the days on which matches are played. A case is cited of a player who earned  6 10s. for 2  days&apos; football, and who, in addition, received 4 days&apos; unemployment insurance benefit. City (London).  S.T.41.  Of 350 printers&apos;  assistants  registered at  the Exchange 50  percent, are working only on  days at the  week-end.  Of 50 printers&apos;warehousemen, one-third  are  week-end workers.   Of 40 portersone-half are week-end workers ; and  12 or 14 motor drivers in the printing trade work at week-ends only.  Wages are paid at the rate of time and a half for Saturday work,and double pay for Sunday work.  The week-end earnings of each ofthe types of workers mentioned  above, viz., printers&apos; assistants,(2015C)F
warehousemen, porters and drivers range from  2 to  3.  The latter is  probably the normal maximum, but the minimum may be lessthan  2.   The week-end workers mentioned above are engaged in this typeof work regularly, although some of them work on  Thursdays, also for the early editions of the Sunday papers.   The following are typical instances of week-end workers in the printing trade :    Aged 44 ; printers&apos; assistant ;  formerly worked at two newspaperoffices for between  18 months and 2 years ;  from November,  1929,to March, 1930,  the  claimant worked on  36  days always at theweek-end ; from March till July he was in a full-time job, probably on holiday relief ; from July to October,  11 weeks, his employmentaveraged  2 - 5  days  a week, always at the week-end ; his earningswere  between  2 and  3 a week.  His benefit averaged  1 Is. Ad.a  week, in respect of himself, wife and 3  children ; it is not known whether in addition he drew trade union benefit.   Aged 42 ; motor driver ;  employed by the company running anevening and a weekly paper ; during the 17 weeks, from October, 1929, to February,  1930, he worked 23 days ; he then had full timework for six months until August ;  since August he had worked atweek-ends only ;  his week-end work had resulted in earnings of from 2 to  3 a week, and  he  received 17s.  Ad. benefit each week for himself and wife for other days of the week.   Aged 45 ; printers&apos; warehouseman ; employed only on a weeklypaper ;  has signed regularly since January 40  weeks and has done 89 days  of work, including every Saturday  and the remaindermostly on Thursday ;  average 2-2  days  per week  ; earns  2  to  3 a week, plus benefit at the rate  of 17s. Ad. each week for 4 days  in the week.   The above  3 claims are  typical of those of week-end workers  in the printing trade.   A  number  of week-end workers in the trade work only up  to midnight on Saturday, and thus would receive from 25s. to 30s. only. Walsall.  S.T.3U.   Aged 29 ;  employed as  sandwich boardman 1 day per week for past  S months ; only 17 weeks insurable work since 1924.   Aged 58;  employed as  sandwich boardman  1 day per week for past  2 years and has only done&apos;9 weeks additional work since 1922. Hull.  S.T.42.    Claimant aged 63 ; draws on an average 3 days&apos; benefit per week ; from a subsidiary  occupation as scene  shifter he  receives  18s. per week ; a further 4s. is earned each Saturday for packing scenery, and in addition he receives 20s.  to 30s. each week-end for arranging for the removal of  artistes&apos; boxes. Northampton. S. T.43.    Works as night  watchman at week-ends only ; he has  done  no regular work since 1921 ; 20 contributions represent 23 days&apos; work. Gloucester. S.T.44.    Widow ; aged 57 ; in receipt of Widows&apos; Pension ;  she has worked  1 day per week since 1927,  at a coffee house ;  in addition she has done 1 day&apos;s charing since December,  1929;   108 days&apos; benefit drawn since 16th April, 1930.  Dundee.   S.T.45.    Ten bakers  work  Friday and  Saturday in  each week  (wages  26s. 2d.) and draw benefit for remaining 4 days ;  no other employ-  ment;  11 others work one day per week (wages 13s. Ad.).
CASES IN WHICH THE CLAIMANT DOES NOT APPEAR REALLY                 TO  NEED  THE BENEFIT.  The financial position of claimants to benefit is not enquired into,therefore it is not possible to give particulars of cases where the lossof benefit would not result in undue hardship.   There are, of course,cases included under other heads, e.g., married women, pensioners,etc. ;  and attention has been drawn  to the  case of widows withpensions, some of whom are young and live at home, where theirfathers  and other relatives are in employment.  There  may  benumerous other  cases of persons drawing benefit either on contri-butions or transitional benefit and who have  some private means.There are also cases of men drawing benefit whose wives carry  onboarding houses, etc.North Eastern  Tr.3.  Is a  case where a man is claiming transitional benefit whose wifeis in employment earning   2 10s.  per week, while  he himself is engaged in the subsidiary occupation of running a Christmas Club.Blackburn Tr.4.  A man  who last  worked in March,  1923, and whose wife is inemployment claims for himself and three children.  Has 60 per cent.pension amounting  to  3  2s., benefit  1 3s.,  wife&apos;s earnings 12s.,total  4 17s.Glasgow 2.  Man ;  aged 23 ; clerk.  Father, a clerk, and working.   Brother,aged 30,  an engineer, working.  Brother, aged 26, a clerk, and working.  Sister, aged 30,  a clerk, working.  Mother at  home.A married sister, husband and family also reside in same house.
   CASES  IN  WHICH  THE  CLAIMANT  CAN HARDLY BE       REGARDED AS IN  THE INDUSTRIAL FIELD.  Among the  cases referred to are small holders.   In the south-western area there are many  such cases where the claimant is theowner of considerable stock.   It appears to be almost impossible to prove in this  type  of case that the profits exceed  1 per week.In view of the fact that the men reside upon the small holdings, theirrent includes that of a dwelling house,  and in making calculationsthis  fact is usually not  taken into  consideration.  In these casesdependants benefit is usually  claimed for  the wife, though theclaimant or the wife would appear  to be engaged in  an occupationcarried on for profit. An example of this kind of case is : -Truro.  Tr.9.  Man; aged 41, married ;  normal occupation tin-miner, six years ;has a small holding comprising 12 acres, rent  30 per annum ; stockincludes 2 cows, 2 yearlings, 1 sow,  20 fowls.  There are many cases  where the stock is larger.  Scotland also reports a large number of cases (at least 300) of menwho are crofters,  squatters or cottars, who do some  fishing.  none of these have sought  regular insurable empk^inent, but have obtained short spells of road-making, mainly on the western isles,sufficient to enable them to draw benefit.  An example of the other cases in this group is : -St. Auslell.   Tr.10.  Man ; aged 51, registers as general labourer; worked fairly regularlyup to 1st June, 1927, as Rural District  Council labourer.  The onlyemployment performed  since has been temporary Christmas work during the Christmas pressure in 1928 and 1929, our days worked ineach spell.
       CASES OF DOUBTFUL  INDUSTRIAL CAPACITY.  Among these cases may be included persons of limited physicalcapacity,  nystagmus cases,  and others in receipt of Workmen&apos;compensation, persons of doubtful mental calibre. Typical cases are reported from almost every division.Midlands.  D.C.1.  Man, aged 57 ;  worked at pottery for 35 years to 1922 ;  compen-sation 6 years (35s. per week) to  1925 ;  lump sum settlement  350  ;lead poisoning case.Midlands.  D.C.2.

APPENDIX 17.                     PENSIONERS, ETC.  The  following are examples of cases of claimants  who  are  inreceipt of pensions, and are also drawing benefit.  Mention has been made in Appendix 14 of the cases of widows inreceipt of Widows&apos; Pensions, a further example is : Bur stem.  Tr.16.  Widow ;   aged 28 ;  in receipt  of 21s.  per week Widows&apos; andOrphans&apos; Pensions in respect of self and 3 children ;  has done  no work since  August,  1928 ;  receives 21s.  per week U.I. benefit;when in employment  was  a fustian cutter earning on  full-time25s. per week.Burslem.  Tr.17.  Widow ;  aged 36 ; Glost placer of poor industrial record, and not likely to re-enter the industrial field ; has really no incentive to tryas pension for self and children with Unemployment Benefit exceed the amount  of her possible earnings.Burslem.   Tr.18.  Widow ;  aged 40 ;  in receipt of Widows&apos; and  Orphans&apos; Pensions,24s., plus U.I. benefit for self and 4 children ; has one son  earning20s. per week ;  her last regular work was 3-  years to  1926 as silkfinisher;  has since  then  had only occasional work at the rate of30s. per week.  Other cases in this category are men who are in receipt of pensionsfrom their previous employers.  There are on the register a consider-able number of operatives formerly employed by an association ofemployers who are said to employ some SO per cent,  of the totalnumber of persons in the industry ; therefore, these people have little prospect  of re-absorption  in  their  ordinary  work.   Theseclaimants are already in receipt of pensions of  1 to 25s. per week,are  also in  receipt of dependants&apos; benefit, and  in some cases their wives are earning.   Examples are :  Yorkshire.   Tr.19.   Man ;  aged 61 ;  48 years&apos;  employment ;   retired  as  foremancrabber ; is now registered as hoistman ; rate of pension is  not known. Yorkshire.   Tr.20.   Two men, aged 62, registered as clerks ; pension rate not known. Midlands.    Tr.21.   Woman ;  aged 55 ;  single ;  discharged after 40f years&apos; service with  late  firm on a pension of  26s. per week ;  no likelihood of obtaining further employment.   Man ;  aged  60 ;  married ;   registered as  packer ;  employed 33 years up to 3rd January, 1930 ;  now in receipt of pension, plus Unemployment Benefit.   Man ;  aged  63 ;  married ;  registered as local engine driver; employed for 34 years by late firm to 1927 ; now  in receipt of pension, plus transitional benefit.
  There are approximately 15 additional male employees of thiskind at this Exchange.  Other examples of this class are : North-Eastern.   Tr.23.  Man aged 64 ; ex-employee of the Corporation ;  in receipt of17s.  Ad. per  week pension.  Only employment he has had since may, 1928, is for one week as a temporary postman in November,1928.  Is  registered for light  work, but  prospects  of  obtainingfurther employment are remote.North-Eastem.   Tr.24.  Woman aged 54 ; was pensioned as she is now very deaf and frail;was employed by cocoa makers.  It is unlikely that she will readilyfind  work again.North-Eastem.   Tr.25.  Woman aged 61, who was pensioned after 30 years employment as a school teacher ;  taught in private school from January, 1928, toDecember, 1929, and has since claimed benefit.Midlands.  Tr.26.  Man aged 61 ;  married ; hoist attendant for 26 years to August.1930 ;  awarded  1 per week pension ; is now receiving 26s. per weekbenefit, plus  Trade Union  benefit.Midlands.  Tr.27.

Man aged 50; single  ; employed by large  boot firm as  clerk, for34 years to March, 1928, was  not insurable ; has since done 10 weeksinsurable  work as casual clerk;  in receipt of  1 per week pension and  17s. benefit.North-W estern.  Fr.30.  Man aged 62; was a  platelayer up to June, 1929; was pensionedat 17s. lOd. per week.  He is also caretaker of a mission hall andreceives  6 per annum and free accommodation.South-Eastern.   Tr.31.  Particulars  are given of a number of naval and  military pen-sioners whose ages vary from .43 to 63, and who are in receipt ofpensions varying from 30s.  to  2 per week,  some of whom  aredrawing benefit in respect of their contributions, and others  aredrawing transitional benefit.  Other cases  are : Scotland.   Tr.32.  Man  aged  55 ; married ;  registered  for work as plumber ;  was employed with Corporation  Baths Department, 27 years  to  July, 1929 ; pension 35s. per week ;  is in receipt of 30s. per week benefit.Scotland.   Tr.33.   Man aged  64; widower; registered for work as caretaker;  em-ployed with Corporation Fire Department, for 36 years to June, 1929;pension  2 6s.  9d. per week ; is receiving 17s. per week benefit. Scotland.   Tr.34.   Man aged 62 ; worked 47 years with one firm as linotype operator ; receives  2 10s. pension from employer and  15s. from his Trade Union.  This man is not allowed to work at his trade by his Trade Union, and all shops in the area are Union shops; therefore, there is very little likelihood of his re-absorption.   Is  in receipt of  26s. benefit.
Scotland.  Tr.35.  Man aged 60; worked 45 years as linotype operator ;  receiving 2 10s.  pension, and  15s. superannuation from Trade Union, plus30s.  per week benefit.Scotland.  Tr.36.  Woman aged 55; was 31 years with her employer; receives 17s,per week pension ;  very doubtful whether this claimant  will everobtain further employment;  is  also drawing  benefit.  Attention is also directed to the cases in which gratuitous paymentshave been made to  workers on termination of  employment.  As an example, instances are quoted of employees discharged as surplus to requierements by a cocoa works.  In the case of male employees the firm made payment of one week&apos;s wages in lieu of notice,  and a giftunder the following scale :   Married men 21  years  of age and over:          First  13 weeks, 25s. per week.         Second 13 weeks, 22s. 6d. per week.         Third  13  weeks, 7s. 6d. per week.  Single men  21  years of age  and over :          First  13 weeks, 17s. 6d. per week.         Second 13 weeks, 8s. Qd. per week.      (Single men under 21 years of age  received similar payments    according to age, and women received smaller amounts, but    similar in proportion.)  Benefit was disallowed for the  one week in respect of which wages were received in lieu of notice, but no disallowance was imposed inthe case of the gift payments.
Scotland.  Tr.35.  Man aged 60 ;  worked 45 years as linotype operator ; receiving 2 10s. pension, and  15s. superannuation from Trade Union, plus30s.  per week  benefit.Scotland.  Tr.36.  Woman aged 55; was 31 years with her employer; receives 17s.per week pension ;  very doubtful whether this claimant will everobtain further employment ;  is also drawing benefit.  Attention is also directed to the cases in which gratuitous paymentshave been made to workers on  termination of employment.

Benefit was disallowed for the one  week in respect of which wages were received in lieu of notice, but no disallowance was imposed inthe  case of the gift payments.
         PERSONS IN  SUBSIDIARY  OCCUPATIONS.  A person  employed in a subsidiary occupation is able to claimbenefit only if he can show the subsidiary occupation is such that itcan be performed  in addition  to and outside the normal hours ofhis  normal occupation, and provided that he does not  receive morethan 3s. Ad.  per day.  Attention is drawn to the fact that in some  of these cases theagreement with the employer  allows of the occupation  being con-fined to daj&apos;s on which the worker follows his ordinary occupation,thus leaving the other days free so that he may claim benefit,  andin other cases  the wages are adjusted according to  whether the worker is or is not in  his ordinary employment.  Contributions are payable in lespect  of some subsidiary occupations and claimants inthese cases can  accordingly satisfy the  conditions for the receipt ofbenefit for an indefinite period.  Wales report  that in the Rhondda Valley prior to the depressionin the coal mining industry, musicians  and dance halls were ordin-arily paying not less  than 5s. per night.   It has been found thatunemployed members of the bands so  engaged are largely paid atthe rate of 3s.  per night, whereas members of the bands who arefollowing their usual occupations are paid  5s. or  over for each suchspell ol work.  The suggestion is that  in this instance an  attempthas been made to overcome the &quot; 3s. Ad. per day &quot; obstacle.Birkenhead.   S.O.3.  Report a case of  a bleach worker employed as a school and churchcaretaker rightly and  on Sunday. The wages are 25s. when he is inhis  usual occupation and 20s. when he is unemployed, thus allowingbenefit to be drawn.North Western.  S.O.4.  A gilder on short time for several years has two subsidiary occu-paiions, one as  a turnstile attender at a Greyhound track through-out the year (5 evenings a week) and during the football seasonseason  occasional turnstile attender at a football club.  Remunera-tion at the Greyhound  track 3s. when  signing the  unemployedregister ; 4s. when following his usual occupation.  A similar arrange-ment is made at the football ground.S.O.5.  Turner by trade ;  trade union branch secretary ;  is stated tohave persuaded 17  members of the branch to transfer from IndirectSection  to Direct Section in order to bring remuneration as branchsecretary to 20s a week or under (he generally earns 26s  per week)S.O.6.  Clerk ; turnstile  attender at football ground ;  when unemployedreceives 3s., when working it is increased to 4s.S.O.7.  Several claimants,  members of the  Operative Cotton Spinners&apos;Council.  The fee  received for each meeting was 3s.  9^., but theCouncil reduced the fee to 3s. so that claimants could  qualify for benefit.Hanky.  S.O.9.  Is a typical case out of a number (approximately  15)  claimingU.I. benefit  at the  same Exchange in which a subsidiary occupationis also being followed.  The circumstances are as follows  :   A Greyhound Racers Co. opened a racing track about 3 years ago and a number of workers were employed on each of three eveningsper week and were  paid 5s. per night, plus the cost of their insurancestamps.  The persons in question were not then  allowed to sign forthe days they were to be employed.
  After the track had been opened for about 5 months, the manage-ment reduced the payment to 3s. 3d. per night, which permitted the claimants to sign for the days they were to be employed and to claim that the employment was a subsidiary  occupation.   In all cases,this increased the claimants&apos; total daily income to anything from6s.  3d. upwards, according to the rate of benefit claimed, and boththe employer and the employee benefited by the change.S.0.10.  This man works 1  day a week and draws benefit for the other5 days.   He carries on  a sub-occupation of a steward on 2 nightsweekly, for which he receives 5s. and  is in receipt of a 40 per cent.war disability pension.  The average wage for the day&apos;s work would amount to approximately 12s.S.0.11.  Claimant has been employed  as  a  &quot; Public House Pianist &quot; on saturday each week,  up to  and including  17th January,  1930.His working hours were from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and he was  paid5s.  on each occasion.  He claimed that this night employment wasa subsidiary occupation, but  was disallowed.  As a consequence,other days of  proved unemployment  became ineffective under the&quot; 3 in 6 &quot; part of the continuity rule.  On 18th January, 1930, his employer reduced his pay from 5s. to  3s. per night.  The case  was subsequently  allowed as a  &quot; subsidiary  occupation &quot;,  and theinclusion of Saturday each week as a day of proved unemployment has enabled this applicant to qualify for 3 days U.I. benefit in practi-cally every week since.   This  is  a case typical of many, where the earnings derived  from a spare-time occupation  cannot  be proved,and where the signature for the day in question renders other  days&quot; effective &quot; which would otherwise be  &quot; non-effective  &quot;.  In this case the man&apos;s earnings for  3  days&apos;  work in his  normal occupationare about  2 this added to  3 days U.I. benefit at 5s. per diem, plus the amount received from his subsidiary occupation will approximatea full week&apos;s wages at his own trade.Midlands.

The Birmingham  Register contains 98 claimants with subsidiatyoccupations.   In the majority  of  instances wages appear to  bearranged to  enable  the worker to continue to qualify for benefit.The best example is night theatre attendants who are paid  19s. perweek.   Other examples  are night  barmen  who receive  generally3s. per  evening  and sometimes exactly the maximum amount of3s. Ad.Midlands.  S.O.19.  Man ;  aged 31 ; married.

(There are 12 similar cases  at Nottingham, in 4 ofwhich contributions  are being paid  each week.)North Eastern.   S.Q.21.  Yorkshire  report somewhat similar types of  cases, giving as  an example :   Barmen who were refused benefit when in this subsidiary occupa-tion.  They were earning 24s. a week.  The employers thereuponreduced the claimants&apos; wages to  1 a week, and fresh claims weremade and allowed.  In these cases the claimants lost 4s. a week andgained the amount of benefit for themselves and dependants.  They report other  cases of wages of subsidiary work, such as rentcollecting, being reduced to  less than 3s.  Ad. or being confined to1 day a week thus enabling benefit to be drawn.
