THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    38CP. 393  (30).                                 CABINET.POLICY  REGARDING  OIL  CONCESSIONS IN BRITISH  TERRITORY.         MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    AT the Cabinet meeting held on the 9th October, 1930, consideration was givento a memorandum by the Petroleum Department,  Board of Trade, regarding the entry of foreign capital for the development of oil production  in British territories,upon which the following conclusion was reached :         &quot; (i)  To approve in principle the change in policy proposed by the President    of the Board of Trade in C.I.D. Paper No. 1017-B, while reserving details until    after the matter had been discussed at the Imperial Conference.&quot;    A Memorandum, the terms of which were agreed between the Departmentsconcerned, was accordingly submitted to the General Economic Committee of theImperial Conference  (E (30) 29), but the Summary of Proceedings  of the  ImperialConference contains no reference to this matter, and it would appear that the general question involved was not discussed by the Economic Committee.    The Cabinet at their meeting of the 9th October further concluded         &quot; (ii) To take note that the Secretary of  State for the Colonies desired to    reduce the proposed period of notice of two years  before the  policy came into    effect, at any rate in the case of British Guiana.&quot;&apos;    As it has not been found possible to induce the British Oil Companies to explorefor oil in British  Guiana owing  to their disbelief in  its  existence in commercialquantities, I am now  anxious,  on grounds of general policy in the Colony, that the embargo on the operation of foreign countries in British Guiana should be removedat once, and accordingly, if my  colleagues see no objection, I would propose  to informthe Governor  to that effect, on the understanding  that the latter would not beempowered to make any definitive arrangements with foreign interests without myexpress approval.                                                        (Initialled)       P.    Colonial  Office, November 24, 1930.[22071j
