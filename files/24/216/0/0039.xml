(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE JPHOPEHDY OF HIS BRITaNHIC MAJESTY&apos;S G0VERI3MMT) .                                                 OOPY MO. J?    SECRET.   0.P. 338.(30,),.              CABUIEP.            LOOAL AUTHOR PILES (ADMISSION OP THE PRESS) BILL.                Memorandum by the Minister of Hsalth.          1.   Two Bills have been introduced, one by Mr. Ede,     backed by some members of all Parties, in the Commons,  the     other by Lord Askwith in the Lords.   The object of the Bills     is to make obligatory the admission of the Press to the     meetings of Public Assistance Committees, Guardians Committees,     Assessment Committees, electricity, Commons and Drainage     Authorities and all committees and sub-committees of Local     Authorities so far as they can decide matters without     reference to the Council itself.               At present  the position is regulated by the Looal     Authorities (Admission of Press to Meetings) Act,  1908, whioh     gave the Press a right to be admitted (unless temporarily     excluded by special resolution) to meetings of all Councils     and Boards of Guardians, the Metropolitan and other Joint     Water Boards,  Distress Committees (now abolished)  and (when     they dealt with, matters whioh they could decide without     reference to the Council) Eduoation Committees.               The Local Government Act,  19B9, under whioh Boards     of Guardians were  abolished,  and Public Assistance Committees     were established,  did not declare that  the Act of  1908  Bhould     apply to Publio Assistance  Committees.               A Committee suoh  as the Public  Assistance Committee     is bound by any direction given by the  Council,  in its     administrative scheme or otherwise;    subject  to suoh direction
W ht X they oan admit or exclude the Press as they see fit.   The policy of my Ministry has been to leave the decision  whether the Press should be   admitted to the tooal Authority.   I have not information showing to what extent Local Authorities have deoided to admit the Press to meetings of the PublioAssistance Committees,  exoept that only two out of 145 LooalAuthorities inserted a definite provision to this end in theiradministrative scheme), or to meetings of other committees, suoh as those for Publio  Health or Housing.     2.   Luring the last Session several parliamentary questions were addressed  to me oh the subject of the  admissionof the Press to meetings  of Public Assistanoe Committees,  and I was also approached by deputations both of Members  ofParliament and of the Press.   I then took the line that the discretion had been left  by Parliament to the looal Authoritiesand I did not think, it wise to interfere with that discretion. I took steps, however, to ascertain the views of the  CountyCouncils Association and  the Association of municipal corporations, and they both declared themselves opposed to ameasure compelling the admission of the Press to meetings  ofPublio Assistance Committees, the ground for opposition expressedby the Association of Municipal Corporations being that in lawthe sucoessor to the Board of Guardians is the Town Council andnot its Public Assistanoe Committee, and that the Press are admitted to meetings of the Council.   It is certain  that similar opposition will be forthcoming to the proposed extension to meetings of other Committees.     3.   It may be urged for the Bill that publicity isdesirable in the interests of the democratic administration of
9 *? 9 &amp; fj public services and. that  it would  enable a close scrutiny to  be  kept  on Authorities whose administration is likely to be  harsh  or reactionary.    I feel  bound to emphasise that in my  view the  Bill  is likely  to  receive much support from our own Party on  this  ground.   The Press also will naturally be  strongly in favour  of  it and it is noticeable that Major  Astor is one of  its backers.     4,   On the  other hand^ the following arguments can be adduced against it.     (a)  The Associations  of  the  responsible Local Authorities  have  definitely expressed their opposition. This factor  is not, of course, conclusive, but it must be given  due weight.     (b)  No  one will dispute  that there  should be an informed public  opinion on the activities of Local Author it ies.  But questions of  policy and finance will be discussed at the meetings of  the Councils themselves,  to which the Press will continue to  be  admitted, while the Public Assistance Committees,  for instanoe, and  still more the Guardians Committees  (which are local sub-oommittees of the PublioAssistance  Committees) will have funotions to discharge, for example, when dealing with individual oases which,  in the interests of everybody concerned,  including the recipients of relief, can more appropriately be  handled without the presence of the Press.     (c)  Committees are bodies set up for the more expeditious despatch of public business but if their proceedings are open to the Press, it  is only too likely that lengthy speeches made with an eye to publication will tend to take the place of work-.
9 9 9 I-J 0     (d)  The tendency of recent legislation has been to concentrate looal government functions under the control of asingle responsible elected Local Authority.        At the time when the Act of 1908 was passed,  therewere in exietenoe both ad hoc Authorities suoh as Guardiansand special statutory Committees of the Councils which tended to be treated as being in a special position, eig.  EducationCommittees, Distress Committees.   The looal Government Act,1929, abolished the Guardians and substituted the Councilsthems elves for the Guardians, with a provision for theestablishment of a new committee of the Council.     (e)  There is no doubt that many, if not the greatmajority of Councils approached their administrative schemes under the Poor law Aot with the definite view that the PublicAssistance Committee must not be allowed to develop into an almost separate entity like the Education Committee,  and thatthe new Committee must, as far as possible, take up its position simply as one of the Committees of the Counoil.     (f)  I feel another strong objection to the Bill.   although in its present form it applies to all Committees, it is nodoubt directed primarily to the Public Assistance Conmittee.To place this Committee in the same position as the Counoil inthe matter of the admission of the Press is to exalt  it, andto exalt it may well tend to retard that progressive break-upof the poor law whioh we all desire and was one of the principalobjects of the local Government Act of last year.   There isalready some evidence that Public Assistance Committees lookwith a jealous eye on. for ir-atanoe,  the appropriation of poor law                              4.
55 *Ji (\&amp; *v &apos;ijinatitutions for public health purposes, and any measure which may seem to advance the status  of  the Committee  asagainst the Counoil may add to these  difficulties,     5.   For these reasons, notwithstanding that  the  decisionmay not be popular with some of  our own  Party,  I  recommendthat tho Bill should be opposed  on Second  Reading.                                  (Jntld.)  A.G.21st November, 1950.
