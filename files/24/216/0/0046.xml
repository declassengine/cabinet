COPY EC._95*30).                      STATE  OF TRADE.           MEMORANDUM BY THE  PRESIPEITT OF  THE BOARD  OF TRADE.       T7ith the exception  of  the woollen trade,  the  staple  trades   of the  country  remained  severely depressed during  October and,   in general,  prospects for the near future did  not  improve.       Reports from some of the lighter industries such as  boots   and shoes showod a fair  increase of activity.   Stocks of   manufactured articles appear  to  be falling to  not  unsatisfactory   levels. An  improvement  in  the building  trade  is foreshadowed by   the increased volume of  plans passed by  Local  Authorities.       In the  coal trade the  output  during October remained steady   at about 4,700,000 tons  per week.  The competition from Poland   has become more intense  and Polish collieries  continued to accept   orders  both  immediate and for many months ahead at very low   figures at which it  is impossible  for Great  Britain  to  compete.   The prospect for export  for the  next year is  thus  very  bad, and  it   was stated that the  reduction of hours of work to  take  place next   month  would  further  increase  costs.  The desire was  expressed that   the quotas and  prices under the  new Coal Mines Act would  soon be   settlod so that offers could  be  made for foreign contracts.       In the  iron and steel  trade the position  has  deteriorated   still  further,  only  96 furnaces  being  in blast; in South  Fest Wales   out of 84  furnaces  only  26  were  at work  at  the end of  October.   Outputs for  October  reached fresh low  levels,  415,000  tons for  pig   iron and 512,000 tons for  steel.  The  Continental  Pig  Iron Associa-   tions  have now dissolved with resultant  new price  cutting.  The   marked falling off  in  the  tin-plate  trade which until  recently had   maintained fair working  is  indicated by  the  drop in  the consumption   of spelter from 4,000  tons  to 1,000  tons per month.

industry  has benefited  from  the  slight  increase  in motor  car                                                                  Smanufacture and  is  rather better than at  this  time last year.     Some encouragement in the depressing state  of affairs  inthe building trade  is found  in the   increase  in  the  volume  ofbuilding  for which  plans have been  passed by  the Local Authorities- 6,662,000 for September, 1930,  as  compared with  6,498,000 inSeptember,1929.   Figures for  October now to  hand show a  muchgreater increase  7,895,000  as compared with  a revised figure  of 6,895,000 for September last and  6,511,200  in  October 1929.   Itis significant,  however, that  this  includes only a  small  volume of factories or workshops  ( 201,700);  the  great bulk is for dwelling-houses,  4,432,000, and hopes were  expressed  that the commencementof activity under the Housing  legislation of  this&quot; year would produce a further improvement  not later than  the Hew Year.     The  textile trades still  appear to be dependent upon the  courseof the prices  for the raw material. Raw  cotton rose fairly steadilyafter the first  week in October, but fell in  November, and businessrose and  fell  with  it.   No substantial  improvement  can thereforeon the whole be  reported, and  the  trade  is  now  particularly anxiousin regard to  (1) the possibility of relations with India  remainingon a bad  footing which  would entail a very considerable permanentreduction even in the present-^lay activity of Lancashire, and(2) the effect on British markets of Russian  exports which will beproduced  fram  machinery now  being bought  with the help of BritishGovernment credits  and  worked  under conditions with which othercountries cannot compete ,     As already  Indicated, the wool trade has shown at any ratea temporary improvement during the  month.  Manufacturers  and spinnerwho have  been  pursuing  a prudent policy,  taking orcers at low prices and covering them at  the  last moment,  have now come Into themarket and swelled  the  normal  seasonal  purchases.  The best clasrwools, fine combing merino,  have benefited considerably though lower
3 f!,r)tj u O  iqualities remain depressed.   Seasonal  improvement  has  also been experienced in the  hosiery  trade,  though it is doubtful whether this improvement can be  maintained.   Complaint is made of the heavy importation of foreign goods.      In the chemical trade  general depression continues with slight signs of recovery as for example  in the demand in the paper and artificial silk trades and  in  the consumption of Sulphuric Acid.  Particular stress is laid on the difficulties in  the Australian markets,  due  to  high tariffs, high cost of living and adverse  exchange.      On the whole the state of  the boot  and shoe  -trade is fair; in  Northampton the  prospects for winter  trade is  good and the recent improvement  in Leicester promises to continues      The position in the wheat  market still remains critical. During the month of October the price of wheat fell about l/6d per quarter at Liverpool, and elsewhere  correspondingly.  The price of Canadian wheat, although at  the lowest for 30 years has, it  was stated, been kept above  that of Russian of equivalent quality, so  that little has  been  taken of the  former with  consequent congestion at the ports. The United  States Farm  Board are holding 6o,0uu,0uO bushels  for higher prices  and with a small maize crop the United States is exporting  little.  For the time  being the chief source of supply for  this country  is Russia, and most of the United Kingdom and Continental  ports  hold large unsold stocks, while chartering for November and  December shipment has taken place. In  the near future  an Australian surplus of 20,OO^&apos;,uOO quarters Is expected,  and the Argentine crop promises well.      As for retail  trade Co-operative sales in England ware down 8%  in value for the 4 weeks ending October 11th last  as compared with 1929, but quantities of certain  commodities  were up.  Figures were given showing  the relative declines In wholesale and retail prices of oertain commodities;  while  in  the case  of sugar, butter
                                                               9 P 0                                                                &apos;&apos;\J Kjland bacon the fall in retail prices  was comparatively close  tothat in wholesale prices,  the corresponding figures for flourshow a wide margin,  viz.,  a 27&quot;94 per cent decline  in the wholesale price  for the last twelve  months, the similar retaildecline being only 13*79 per cent.  This slowness in the adjustment of the retail price to the wholesale price wasattributed, at any rate in part,  to  the holding of  stocks boughtat the higher price, and to standing charges.   It was stated in confidence that  the  transactions  of  the Co-operative wholesale society with Russia, which have been of late of  6,00^,000 perannum for the last six years, had for the present year amountedalready to  9,00U,0uU and that all bills drawn on the Sovietorganisations had been promptly met.     As regards  the Department Stores such figures  as had beenreceived showea  a diminution of some 5% as compared with last year&apos;s figures.  Stocks (at cost) have declined nearly &amp;fi which is regardedas a healthy feature.  The trade  generally is in a  very sensitivecondition,  and  it would appear that the policy of  restrictingpurchases to a minimum is still being pursued by the public in spiteof the substantial fall that has  taken place in retail prices since last year.     The unemployment figures continue their upward course, and thetotal increased  during October by 65,812, to 2,237,501*, the increasein the number of wholly unemployed being, however,  as much as107,556.     As regards  general conditions abroad the new Governments inArgentine and Brazil were referred to as good Governments and prospects were accordingly brighter, but the surplus stocks cf coffeein Brazil and the uncertain results  of the forthcoming elections  in                        * Subject to revision.                               -5-

In Australia an anticipated deficit in the Commonwealth Budget of from  8,000,000 to  10,000,000 is to be met by- severer additional taxation on incomes.  In indirect taxation the  chief proposals are for increases in duty and duty on tea  and tobacco.  The Australian representative stated that those in control were definitely opposed to the postponement of loan payments and to inflation.      In the money markets there was during October a further contraction in advances to customers.  A firmer tendency in the discount and  short loan markets became evident early in the month.  The Bank of England gold holdings increased, fresh withdrawals being over-balanced by Australian arrivals and the ratio of reserve to liabilities wae 59,4-%.  There was no indication of industrial revival.                                  W. G. Board of Trade27th  November, 1950.

tj XIDEJNiTIAL.     Meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council for                      Wednesday, 15th November, 1950&quot;.            MR.  GILLETT.   Gentlemen,  I  have,  in the  first place,       to express the regret of the President that  it is impossible       for him to &quot;be here  this  morning, but,  with the Imperial       Economio Conference meeting and  in its final  stages  I  think       you will understand the  reason why he  is not  with us today.COAL.     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM.  The output of coal in the UnitedKingdom for the four weeks ended October 25th was asunder:-                                           4,673,000 tons.                                           4,704,000   &quot;                                           4,696,000                                           4,698,000   &quot;The average output for the thirteen weeks August 2nd -October 25th was 4,502,000 tons, as compared with 4,970,000tons for the corresponding period last year.  That is a fall of half a million tons per week in the output.     The number of persons employed in the industry forthe week ended October 25th was 886,800.  The average forthe thirteen weeks ended October 25th was 887,300, as against932,900 for the corresponding period last year.     Unemployment for the month of September was 23.0?o ascompared with 23.6/6. in August, and an average of 16.2% lastyear.     The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom(excluding Irish Free State) in September showed an increase over August, but both months are very much down compared with1929, the figures being:                   li3.9.v             1929.August......... 3,747,321 tons    4,778,009 tons   Decrease                                                   1,030,688September...... 4,399,434  &quot;      4,973,630   :i    Decrease                                                     574,196The average price per ton f.o.b. in September was 16/5, ascompared with l$/2 in August.     Polish exports by sea also showed an increase inSeptember.  The figures are given below, with the corresponding figures for 1929:                   1950.             1929.August........   725,000 tons     758,000 tons     Decrease                                                    33,000September.....   754,000   &quot;      721,000   &quot;      Increase                                                    33,000Week ended October  4th  II    ti      II    LLTH  &quot;    &quot;      &quot;    18th  &quot;    ;;      ;t    25th
9 i OI    So that the  two  months together  give  exactly the same exports    toy sea from  Poland.   Polish Collieries  continue to accept    orders, both for prompt and for  as much as  eighteen months    ahead, at extraordinarily low figures:   so  low, in fact,    that it is impossible for us  to  think of competing with  them -    we can only take their leavings.         The orders  on the books  of  most  of the exporting    collieries in Great Britain for  next  year are very meagre;  in    our case, we have never in all our history  had  such an empty    order book as we have today for  next  year;  in  fact, we  have    practically nothing sold for  export.         The Central Council and  District Boards formed under    the Coal Mines Act are now commencing operations, but it is    difficult to see in what way  the District Boards can help our    exports.  The only hope would seem  to be some move towards    International agreement on the part of  the  Central Council.    The position for next year is most  serious, and from the    beginning of next month we are having our costs further    increased by a reduction in the  hours of work.  Our competitive    position was already bad, but this will make it hopeless.    Our exports  continue to show  a h?avy  fall as compared with    last year, and the position in  the exporting districts is    becoming very serious.  Collieries  supplying the home market    are having some  benefit from  the seasonal demand for domestic    purposes;  otherwise the position is  that we are waiting    events without undue optimism.         MR. GILLETT.   Are the decreased exports due to a    lessened demand, or to the demand being met by  other    countries?         MR. RIDLEY  WARHAM.   Chiefly the  demand is  being met by.    other countries.  Poland seems  to be  taking orders absolutely    regardless of price.  I have  in  my  pocket a letter from  a man    who bought coal from us in Ronne, Denmark.  He  told us he had    received our price, through an exporter, of 20/3d c.i.f. At    the same time he had received an offer  of the very best    Polish coal at 17/- c.i.f. He  accepted it, of  course, but he    wrote to say &apos;What puzzles me is why  the Poles  have taken    such a price;  I would willingly have paid  20/- c.i.f.  (3d.    below our price) for such good  coal.&apos;   He  could not    understand their system.  Of  course,  they have  no  system;    they are cutting each other&apos;s throats.         KR. GILLETT.  Our figures showed a decreased export    of half a million tons.  The  Polish decrease  is practically    negligible.   What I mean t was -  who is  supplying  that half    a million tons?         MR. RIDLEY WARKAM,  Germany has  also increased her    exports a little and she has  also decreased her imports,    under her licensing system;   v/e are  not shipping so much    there as We were before.         SIR TALTER RAINE. I also wish  to speak, first of all,    about the coal trade.  Sofar as Durham is  concerned,  there    has been an increased demand  during the past month, and  this    is likely to further improve, until we  get  past the shortest    day because, as  is wellknown  in  the coal trade, during  the    Autumn and early  (inter the demand for  gas  coals  is always
very great.  Mr. Ridley Warham has just referred to Poland.I have a couple of illustrations of Polish competitions whichhave come under my immediate notice in my own office duringthe past week:-     Last week tenders were asked for by the StockholmElectricity Works for Small Coals.  The price quoted by myfirm, which was reasonable, was 17/- c.i.f. Stockholm,including 4/9 freight for Lambton/Horden/South Hetton Smalls.The contract has been given for Polish Pearls.  Messrs.Gr.  andL. Beijers have secured 10,000 tons at ll/8 c.i.f.  size 5/15num. and Messrs. A.  Johnson and Company have secured 10,000tons at 12/I5 c.i.f. size 5/20 m.m. This means an f.o.b. priceof 7/6 to 7/9 at the outside.  As the railway carriage is  3/2 per ton, this leaves a pit price of 4/4 to 4/7.     On Monday last, I received a communication from myAgent in Copenhagen, pointing out that these Polish Pearlswere being offered at under 8/- f.o.b. Danzig, of which thebuyers have had good experience, the heating power of thesecoals slightly exceeding that of Scotch Singles, and even  of.3.Y. Washed Smalls.  About a month ago large contracts were also placed for Polish Large Coal and Household Nuts at ll/-to 11/6 f.o.b. and for prompt shipment concessions are being allowed even on these prices.     Patent Coke is very difficult to dispose of, and theprice is barely 17/- f.o.b.  As for Gas Coke, some of thecompanies have had to reduce their price, because owing to themildness of the weather the demand is not anything like what it usually is at this season of the year.     There still prevails great uncertainty about the future,and those connected with the trade only wish that the quotas and Limitation Prices were settled, so that it mightbe possible to make offers for contracts.  Yesterday tendershad to be sent in to the Naples Gas Works for 25,000 tons  forthe next five months.  No colliery would quote a price thatwas anywhere in accord with what they are taking for prompt.Tomorrow tenders have to be sent in for 55,000 tons ofsteam coals for the Norwegian State Railways.  The sameapplies, at any rate so far as Durham is concerned;   wesimply cannot get prices.  So the sooner we get thesequestions settled the better it will be.SHIPBUILDING.     With regard to shipbuilding, conditions on the NorthEast Coast and, I think, throughout all the ports areterrible.  New orders are practically non-existent.     With regard to ship repairing, the position is fairlygood on the North East Coast, but there is no improvement on the West Side.
o x 0     I have been requested,  Sir,  on behalf of  the  Associationof Chambers of Commerce,  to  oall  your attention to theposition of Russian trade.    I have no doubt  you  will  havealready received a copy of the Resolution which was passed at the monthly meeting of the Executive last Wednesday,pointing out to you, in particular, that this  dumping is causing such a serious state of affairs, or that the serious position of the workers of this country has been accentuated by what I can only oall the unnatural dumping  of Russian  goods which is going on.   The position is going to  be furtheraggravated by the dumping of 300,000 Russian doors into thiscountry next year from Russia at  a price with which it  isquite impossible for the Britisher to compete.  You know  toowell the position with regard to Russian wheat, soap, andother consumable commodities for me to do more than mention the matter, but I now wish to turn to the other side of thequestion just for a moment and refer to the exports which aretaking place from the United Kingdom to Russia.   I understandthat there is in the Board of Trade already information withregard to what is going on in respect to buying.   Russia isbuying from us on three, six, and nine months oredit, sixtyper cent, of whioh is guaranteed,  I think, by yourDepartment.   Two things are happening.   First of all, someof these goods are being sold at a loss for cash to othercountries; it is quite true - I made enquiry - that the lossis less than it would be if Russia had to borrow an equivalent amount of money.   Then, Sir, contradictory  as itmay seem - I think you are already aware of this,  or, at anyrate, the Board of Trade is aware of this - there is abroker in London who is in charge of what I can only calla dummy Discount House, and he is prepared - and he is  actuallydoing it - to buy bills via the Russian Bank for foreign trade, which are attached to bills of  lading.     It has further been reported to the Chamber of Commercethat sales of goods of other nationalities have been made bythe Soviet in exactly the same way as  I have described and Ihave been requested by the commercial  community to tell youwith what alarm they view what is taking place.  :cany peoplethink that it is a sinister movement on the part of the Sovietto pull down the whole fabric of European society and,  inparticular that of Great Britain.   I  was asked, Sir, to makea strong appeal to you not to allow any further credits toRussia, because we do not see any reason why, when they are sending us five or six tines the quantity of goods they takefrom us, they should not pay oash.   Therefore, Sir, I thinksome definite arrangement ought to be  come to with Russia bywhich they should take a much larger proportion of goods, andthe proportion cught to be fixed, than they are taking at thepresent time from us and, as there  is  no reasonable possibilityof their buying from us a similar amount to that whioh we,even in the normal course of events, are taking from them,there is no reason why they  should not pay cash for these goods instead of allowing them to  get  away with the money and pay some of our foreign  competitors for goods whioh theyhave bought from them.     LIE.  GILLETT.   Sir Walter, you have opened a very big subject, whioh  it would  be impossible to discuss here,I think, or if we did discuss it all the other delegates whoare waiting behind you would find  that their reports would never be delivered to the Council at all.   I do not know
whether you think the most satisfactory way would be eitherto send in a memorandum, or, when the President has moreleisure, for you to see the President personally so as todiscuss these matters with him.    There are some of thepoints, if I may say so, for instance as to the amount of thegoods really ooming over here as to which there is a certainamount of discussion*   Ydu^ point about the buying of the bills, I would suggest to you could be interpreted in quite a reasonable way really, on the  normal financial principlethat it is very sound finance, if anyone wants to have billson a market, to have an outlet where, to a certain extent,they are buying the bills, just  as the British Governmentfinds it useful to have a Sinking Fund to buy stocks in orderto sustain the market,,   There are all sorts of considerations of that kind which, if you began to sift these things, might give a certain explanation.   You yourself have indicated thedifficulty of Russia getting any loans in the world which,shall I say, compels them, or Is one of the reasons why theyadopt these methods of raising money;  I think you statedthat it is really cheaper for them to sell their goods in thisway than it is to raise a loan?     SIR WALTER RAINS.   Yes.     MR. GILLETT.   Of course, it is a most peculiarposition..   We have never had a great Empire like Russia inthe position Russia is in today and I entirely agree with you that it is opening out vast problems which I thinkpossibly today are, broadly speaking, in one sense, not a veryserious factor in our trade, but which, I quite agree with you, may become an exceedingly serious factor, and it is undoubtedly a thing we have to watch most  carefully.    I donot know really whether you want me to go into the question,or how you will make your representation to the President.     S2R WALTER RAINE.   That is what we want.   The point is that on the Executive ef the Association of Chambers ofCommerce there are some of the leading business men in thecountry and they viewed the thing so  seriously a weekyesterday that they passed a resolution and they asked howsoon was it possible to get the facts, some of which arealready known to the Board of Trade, before the President, andI said I would be here this morning specially.    I do not want any discussion about it.   We want action rather than any discussion and if you think there  should be either adeputation to the President of the Board ef Trade, or amemorandum sent to him, I will see that it is done forthwith.     MR. GILLETT.    I think really that would be  the best course.   There Is just one point which  concerns  my departmentwhen you said - why do we not stop giving  the advantages  ofthe Export  Credits Department to the Russians,   As a matterof fact, the amount  of business that has been done throughthat department has  not been very large, but this has always to be borne  in mind,  that,  of course,  that department  is  notthinking of Russia or any other part  of the world.   What weare doing is we are  making  it possible  for British goods  to be exported.   What you are  asking, presumably, is that  even thesmall amount that is  done  should be  stopped.   That,  of  coursehas an effect upon the exporter  in  this  country.   These  other
countries, as we know - America, Germany, and Czecho-Slovakia -are doing this business and are giving in some form financialassistance and we have to bear in mind that, to some extent, weare going to hit certain exporters in this country if we refuseto give those facilities,     SIR WALTER RAINE.   That same point was raised at theExecutive meeting and what they were really concerned about wasthe possibility of Russia defaulting.   They say it cannot belong before she does and It will be a great smash up when it comes.     MR. GHJLETT.   AS you know, the most debatable point is ast*f) whether Russia is going to default.   I read endless documentsfrom all sorts of people about this point of view.     I should like to point out, with regard to the question of sugar which was mentioned and very much debated in the papers,we understood that that order for sugar really meejit that arefinery somewhere in Scotland or the North of England was keptgoing by that order for some weeks or months.   That is thepoint we have kept in view, the work it has provided there.We are not thinking whether it is convenient to Russia or not.We are thinking whether that order goes up there or whether itgoes to some other country    But if that meets you, will yousend a memorandum to the President?     SIR WALTER RAINE.   Certainly.     MR. GILLETT,   We appreciate the oxtreme importance of thecase but, as I say, it impresses me more in regard to thefuture, than in regard to what as far as I  can see is thegeneral effect upon trade at the present moment.                            CHEMICALS.     DRa  CLAYTON:   Speaking  of the  Chemical industry as a  whole,-there  is  little  to report  which Is  of  general applicability  in respect of  the past month,  While  some  have found indications Of a brighter future,  it is  an unquestioned fact  that no one  is relying on  it to the extent  of making  contract arrangements  on a normal  scale * Heavy  Chemicals.     The  general depression  in trade continues, though a few industries  show  slight signs of recovery and the  general outlook seems  more  optimistic     Severe competition is being felt  in Japan from the Americans-and local makers and, In South America, from the Russians.   The  anti-British boycott Is  also having a slight effect in India, but altogether the export trade  has been  well- maintained.
     In the home trade,  the consumption of alkalioontinues &quot;below normal but there is a distinct increase  inenquiries.  There appear to be signs of increased activity in the paper and artificial silk trades.  The soap andglass trades seem to be about normal but the textile trade generally continues in a very depressed state.     The chlorine market is about normal and oalls forno special comment, although here again the depression inthe textile trade is felt.    Smaller sales of hydrochloric acid are a reflectionof the general depression in the metal trades.  There isan improvement in the consumption of sulphuric acid, thisnot being attributable to any particular trade.     Fertiliser sales oontinue normal for this time ofthe year.     Reduced sales of dyes are a further reflection of theslackness in the textile trades.  American competition isaffecting sales of Indigo abroad.     Pine Chemicals.     Home trade in medicinal ohemicals during the past monthhas shown some slight improvement, as is usual at this timeof year.     Export trade in drugs and fine chemicals, however, hasbeen, If anything, worse.     In South American markets business has been gravelyaffected by the political troubles.  Generally speaking, thebuying, capacity of these markets has been seriouslydebilitated.  On the other hand, better conditions inBrazil may now be expected.     As distinct from the position of heavy ohemicals inIndia, the boycott of British drugs and fine  chemicals at last shows definite signs of weakening.      In the Australian market business Is practicallystagnant at the present time.  There are several contributoryfactors:  one is that many of the items in principal demand in Australia are now being made by Australian manufacturers,and the duties have been advanoed considerably in order toprotect the home manufaoturer.  For example,  the duty onbismuth  has been advanced to 8/- per  lb., making itimpossible for  importers to  purchase from this country.  Somebuyers ask to be guaranteed  payment of the difference in exhange, which represents a charge of 10 per cent.  Taxationin Australia is on the increase:  on all imports there isnow a sales tax of 2^- per cent, primage 2-J- per cent., and inaddition  the exporter has to pay import ad valorem duty onpacking cases and bottles.     To summarise the conditions in the Australian market:the Australian manufacturers have effectively shut out byhigh tariffs those fine chemicals which they are manufacturingthemselves, and trade generally is bad owing to the highoost of living caused by the higher prices charged for thehome manufactured goods, and the higher taxation imposed.  Inaddition to this, importers have to pay an extra 10 per cent.
on all purchases from Great Britain owing to the difference in exchange.     Tar Producte:     To report in detail on the markets for the various coaltar fractions would merely be a repetition of previous reports with the exception of the Naphthas.  These appearto have been provided with a brighter market recently but of course the most phenoninal development in the trade inNaphthas will never compensate for the all round depressionin every other fraction.     MR. GILLFTT.  The reduction in exports to SouthAmerioa, did that remark apply to any other country exceptBrazil?     DR. CLAYTON:  I think to South America generally.During the upset we have had a reduction there.     MR. GILLETT:  I asked-because I think we had been rather given to understand that in most countries thesedisturbances had had hardly any effect?     DR. CLAYTON:  I have not the figures here, Sir, butthat was the report I had from them.RUBBER.     SIR G. BEHARRELL:  The commencement of the new motoringseason, which synchronises with the Show, has marked aslight increase in the activities of motor car rranvfacturorsand that at once is reflected in the demand for tyres.  the replacement market too has shown signs of revival and, infact,, for the last few weeks 3ome inoreases over theprevious year have been recorded.  The motor cycle and cyclebusiness remains dull, but the present Show at Olympia seemsto mark a revival of activities.  The motor cycle and cycletrades have been very severely hit in the export marketsduring the past year;  probably India has been their worstexperience.  Decreases in export have far exceeded anyslight increases they have had in the home market during theyear.     Boots and Shoes are fairly active but with very severecompetition, particularly from the Par East and fromContinental manufacturersj  buying has been delayed, I think,owing to the disturbances in the price situation.     Surgicals - there is a slight improvement in the home market OUCIOOK,  The export market oontinues to be very slack.     Mechanicals, of course, follow the general trade ofthis country and have now had a very long period of quite dulland unprofitable business.     The same applies to ebonite.     Rubber thread, which has been a very important branchof the rubber Industry for some time, is not quite so bright
as It was.  There is a falling  off in demand owing  possibly to changes in fashion and that  has led to over-productionand the inevitable price-cutting and reduced profit has followed.     Rubber soles and heels  The Home market Bhows aellfht improvement.  The export market Is sluggish.Competition is very severe.     Sports Goods remain very active and the outlook ispromising.     The waterproof garments branch of the rubberindustry is really busy.  Factories are all working, mainly on cheap quality lines, but still there Is very goodemployment in the waterproofing section of the industry.    MR. GILLETT:  They told me  at the Motor Exhibitionthat although our exports had fallen, the exports of competing nations had fallen equally badly?     SIR GEORGE.BEHARRELL.  That Is true.00-OPERATIVE TRADE.     MR.. ARTHUR VARLEYj The figures this month seem tome to he rather interesting dealing with general conditionsof prices and things In general.  Our sales, in cash,compared with a year ago are down 8 per cent., but our supplies of flour, In quantify, are up as also our suppliesof biscuits, margarine and soap.  Our supplies of bootsand shoes are up 5 per cent, or 14,000 pairs over twelvemonths ago *     The wholesale and retail prices of four articles, ascompared with twelve months ago are down as follows:-SUGAR:    Wholesale.....  18.5 3 per cent.-     Retail........  15.38 pe&apos;r  cent.BUTTER.   Wholesale.....  25.37 per oent.-    Retail........  22.33 per cent.FLOUR:    Wholesale.....  27.94 per cent.---     Retail........  13.79 per cent.BACON:    Wholesale.....  23.0  per cent.-     Retail........  22.2  per cent.     In regard to butter, during the first two weeks ofSotober the Scandinavian markets ruled steady at unchangedvalues, and the following fortnight advanced 10/- to 15/-due to extra inquiry from Continental countries.  these advances resulted in higher counter prices, and werereluctantly followed by retailers and importers, which hasresulted during the past week in a further fall, and bringspresent values about 2/6d. per owt. higher than at thecommencement of the present period.  The conditions of themarket at present are exceptional, Banish being extremelydear in comparison with Colonial.  The figures show thatDanish is down, as compared with a year ago, 44/6d. perowt;   Swedish 50/6j Finnish 54/6dj New Zealand 69/6d; and australian 68/-.
     So far as sugar is concerned,  during October  the rarketrecovered l/Sd. of the ?,/- per cwt. lost  in September.    the upward move is due to the plan (to  be submitted to the  OubanCongress for ratification this week) to segregate  1% million tons Raw out of current Cuban production and deliver it tosome organisation for disposal outside the United  States over  aperiod of five years, and also to restrict the next crop.immediately after the ratification, if carried, a  Committee isexpected to come to Europe to arrange with Dutch interests which control Java production, as to some international actiontf: support the market, which at the moment is about &quot;d. percwt. lower and is quietly awaiting developments.  Traderequirements are covered up to about the end of the year. Thefuture course of prices will depend on the success or  failureof the negotiations in Cuba and Holland.     In dried fruit, a good demand has been met with duringthe past month for new fruit of all descriptions at the lowerrange of prices which has obtained.     Greek currants and Smyrna sultanas have lately shown atendency towards eaoier prices, but the position is nowfirmer again for both.   Reports of floods in Smyrna area,resulting in damage to sose hundreds of tons of fruit,  havebeen mainly responsible for the altered situation in sultanas,     Cretan sultanas, which have been very popular thisseason, are becoming exhausted and substantial advances havetaken place.     Australian sultanas are plentiful but of mediocrequality.   Supplies of Australian currants are negligible and quality poor.     In tea, the market was much more active at the openingof the month and prices for all descriptions consequentlyhardened.   Common and medium grades advanced in price by %d.to Jda per pound, whilst fine grades, particularly from Ceylon,met with very  strong competition and realised high prices dueto considerable improvement in quality.   During the second half of the month, however, the market became irregular andthe hardened prices were not maintained;   common and mediumgrades showing a decline of ^d. to Id. per pound,   This was due to a falling off in quality, particularly in the case ofCeylons.   Good liquoring teas, however, continued strong andwere quoted, fully firm.  Leaf teas suitable for export soldsteadily.  Java and Sumatra offerings moved off quietly and prices tended  in buyers&apos; favour.     In bacon  and hams, the low level of prices mentioned inthe previous report continues to operate and with Danishkillings still on a big scale, and supplies in general beingquite  equal to demand there v/culd appear to be no reason for prices advancing to any appreciable  extent for some time tocome.   It  is  just possible that November, acting up to  itsreputation, may bring about an easing in values.     Potatoes  - during the month there was a slight lift invalues, but the position has now eased up a little.    Thegeneral feeling is for better business, but complaints ofdiseased produce are numerous.     Oranges - the season for South African was well advancodand there was  an increase in prices.   The demand, however,was quite good.
**i n tTJ     Apples - American barrel apples  were  not  an  over  supplyand quotations were rather on the  high side.   Empire  applesfrom Canada were fairly cheap in comparison.   There  wereheavy arrivals of box varieties, which sold at quite reasonablefigures.     Onions, Spanish Valencias,  prices during  the periodwere very low, and contrary to expectations are lower  still at the present moment *  The quality of the onions is good,but growers and shippers must be losing money  heavily.     So far as wheat is concerned, since my last  reportmarkets have generally shown a sagging tendency,  Liverpoolbeing about l/6d. per quarter lower,  Winnipeg  about  2/6d.per quarter lower, and Chicago about l/- per quarter lower,     Canada - during the month under review there was  someinterruption in the harvesting owing to bad weather, and reports were current that a large  quantity would be  left  in stock in the fields during the Winter.   The weather havingturned better, however, a lot of this wheat is now beingthreshed, although some damage has been done and the qualitylowered owing to exposure to the weather.   Owing to the premium asked for Canadian wheat over the equivalent quality of Russian, very little trade is going to Canada, and Millersare using as little as possible.   This has led  to congestionat the seaports, and with the close of navigation getting  nearer the situation is causing anxiety to the Dominion.  Hopes  areentertained that the outcome of the Imperial Conference willgive Canada an opportunity of obtaining a better price for herwheat.     United States of America.  This country appears to benow on a domestic basis,as the  surplus of wheat  is beingtaken care of, to a very large  extent, for the use of feed onaccount of the small Maize orop.   Prices are very much outof line with world parity, and  with the Farm Board reported asholding 60 million bushels which it is stated they will notsell at a loss, it is not likely that the United States ofAmerica will export much more wheat until their new cropwinter wheat, now in the ground, comes out of the winter coversatisfactorily next Spring.     Russia.   Has been a continuous free seller of wheatthroughout the month, and has put afloat large quantities ofwheat unsold, which has had a very depressing effect on themarket.   Most of the ports in  the United Kingdom and on theContinent are holding large stocks of unsold Russian wheat,and further quantities are being put afloat with a resumptionof chartering for November and  December shipment.  Owing to therelative cheapness of this wheat all millers are using itfreely.     Australia.  Favourable conditions for the new crop have continued, branch&quot;it appears almost certain that this oountry willharvest a bumper crop.  Old orop wheat is scarce and in smallcompass, and is demanding a premium.   The latest report isthat Australia will have an exportable surplus of P,0 millionsqrs., and it is difficult to  see at present where theconsumptive demand is going to  arise to take care of this .wheat, owing to the heavy supplies of all wheats available.
Iti? (j ci     India.   Continues to ship small quantities, but  isnot a free seller,  presumably owing to the  disturbed  conditionof the country.     Argentine.   The new crop now nearing harvest  is  inexcellent condition, and within the next two or three weeks,provided no  unforeseen disaster takes place this country shouldharvest a very good crop.   Small quantities of old crop arenow being offered,  and it is quite evident   that the  farmers are clearing out in preparation for dealing with the  new crop,which points to their satisfaction with the prospects.  It  isanticipated that Argentine wheat will meet  a good  demand as itblends so well with Russian.     Maize^   This commodity has experienced a severe fallduring&quot; t he &quot;mo n t h, and is now at the lowest  price it has  touchedin years.  The demand has kept fairly steady, but  the supplies available are more than needed, resulting in a rather severeprice decline.     Barley.  Russia continues to ship barley freely, andwhileThe demand has been good supplies are so plentiful thatthe price keeps low.     Oats.  The price keeps reasonable in line with other commodities.     Milling Offal.  Ho ohange on the month.    Demand keepsfairly steady.     In our drapery departments, the prioe of raw ootton hasadvanced probably by -Jd. per pound..  The price of wool showslittle variation and seems to be pretty well stabilised.At the same time these factors do not seem to have any markedeffect on trade generally, and the  situation remains verydisappointing.     Woollens and Readymades - Trade conditions in theLancashire and Yorkshire areas are unaltered.  Reports are continually coming  to hand that, particularly in the townshardest hit by the  depression, trade is almost at a  standstill.Committees are instructing their Societies&apos; Buyers to buy very carefully,  and generally recommend  the policy of buying only for  immediate requirements.     So far as general furnishing  is concerned there is no improvement in trade to  report.  The depression in theLancashire  and Yorkshire areas is  still very acute andSocieties1 Buyers are only ordering from hand to mouth.  Thisdepression, along with reduced prices,  is  having a serious effect upon the  sales, and the immediate prospects are not tooencouraging.  From  conversations with people in the  textiletrade it  is understood that  there  are better prospects of tradewith China, and  this will, no doubt, in time prove beneficial toLancashire  and so react  on  trade generally.     There  is little  improvement in the demand for furniture,and  the  increased trade  which is usually expected during october and  the  latter part of the  year has not been realised.  RetailSocieties&apos;  Furniture Departments are experiencing seriousdecreases in  sales, resulting from the  abnormal depression in trade at  the  present  time.-IS-
     So far as our Export Department is concerned, which  is confined to the Co-operative Societies in other lands,  thereis just about the usual amount going through.    There aretwo small items here which I think will interest the  Committee,To Bermuda we have sent a consignment of over   1,200 and  toIceland we have sent a consignment of Over  2,500,     Russia seems to be very much in the limelight recently andour name hag been coupled very freely with Russian transactions.During the past month our shipments to Russia  have amounted to 70,703, of which over  21,000 is for margarine, and probablyit will interest the Committee to know that we have a furtherorder for 252 tons of margarine from Centrosojus, which is thecentral organisation of Co-operative Societies in Russia,   I did not intend to say anything further than that about  Russia,but Sir Walter Raine spoke about Russia in, rather a depressingmanner and he said something about losses,  Pernaps  I  might say this.   This will be information, I think, to the  Committee,because we do not make it public.   There are  a lot of  thingssaid about us In the papers, about our Illicit transactions and so on, but we do not reply to them;  we have no need  to;it does not affect us;  it pleases the newspapers and  increasestheir circulation and that is all they desire, so we  think,but our transactions with Russia have been of  a pleasantcharacter up to now and for about six years, through  ourBanking Department, we have  turned over something  like  sixmillion sterling each year.   We have never, yet been asked toextend a bill for a single day.   They have always been met  onthe day appointed, or on previous days.   This year we  have encouraged them - I do not mind mentioning this to you, though,of course, it is private - as we did in 1926-27 when the americans were running away with wheat and getting it  up to  abig price, we encouraged them to send more wheat, which theydid, and we financed it,  I do not mind saying that.    And theprice to the consumer whom we represent and who is our  clientand our particular oare, the price to the consumer was  reduced in face of the extraordinary efforts that were being made bythe Americans to raise the price of wheat.   The same  thing has happened this year,   I have a llst* here lowing the amount  ofshipments since the 1st July which is the beginning  of  the season.   The total grain exports from Russia  into this  country from 1st July up to 3rd November were 691,251 tons,527,621 tons of which is wheat.   That is the amount that hascome forward up to the end of October, that is to say,  forthe benefit of our communities, it has kept the American fromrushing the price up as he was intending to do and he had formed a very strong organisation to raise the price;  it has  kepthim from raising the price of wheat into this  country andit has been to the benefit of the workers of this country,whatever it has been to anybody else,   I do want to emphasise that particular point, if I may, that up to now, and we haveno reason to think anything different will happen,we have never been asked for the extension of a bill for asingle day and our transactions have been over  6,000,000per year for the last five or six years,   I have the  figures in my mind because I happen to be Chairman of  the finance committee which has the Banking Department under its control.Our Banking Department, as some of you will know, is ratherconsiderable;  the second largest in Kanchester:   This yearup to now our transactions with the Russians have been over 9,000,000,   I submit these statements feeling quite confident that you will respect the confidence and  secrecy of them.* See Appendix p. 44.
y rC- J I  should not have made them hut for Sir 7/alter Raine mentioning that  there was drfficulty.  I am fairly closely in touch with what  is happening as between this country and Russia.  My experience of the newspapers is that they are very far from being true.  They are guesses mainly, because of the lack of knowledge which they feel is their lot at the moment.      SIR WALTER RAINE.  I /ould like to ask two Questions, but I would first like to say that all the information I gave  was not from the newspapers; it was from actual fact. I  v/ould also like to confirm what Mr. Varley says, that there is no instance on record when the Russians have defaulted up to now for payment, not a single instance.  I would like to ask this question, Mr. Varley mentioned four commodities that had fallen, roughly, 25 per cent, wholesale during the past year; in three of them he indicated that the retail price had fallen to within about 3 per cent, of that.  In flour there was a difference of 14 per cent.  Is there any reason why flour particularly should not have fallen for the retail price in the same ratio as the others?     MR. VARLEY.  I do not know of any, except my theory is this, that the retail price cannot fall quite as quickly as the wholesale price and wholesale prices have fallen very quickly within the last month.  I think that will account for it.Of course, there are standing charges which are not reduced and there are the stocks which they are trying to get rid ofvdthout loss if they can and I know that at the end of the month end about now the price of bread is going to be very much likeit was pre-war days.     SIR WALTER RAINS.  One other question; would Mr. Varleymind telling me what to-day&apos;s wholesale price per cwt. is for new 3ealan5 butter and for Danish butter?     MR. VARLEY.  I have not to-day&apos;s price.  The prices Ihave are these.   In October 1929 New Sealand butter was 186/-per cwt. and in October 1930 it was 116/6d.  In 1929 Danishbutter was 196/- and in 1930 15l/6d.            COOPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.     MR. CAIRNS.  In connection with what Mr. Varley has said,Mr. Chairman, our experience of the grocery and provision tradeduring the past month has been a continuance of the low prices for the staple articles of food.  In spite of the slightexception furnished by sugar, the price of granulated is still 3/6d per cwt. lower than a yesr ago.     He are finding in Scotland a very brisk demand for creamerybutter from the Irish Free State and with the quality very fineit constitutes at the price the best value in the market at the present time.   Danish, however, in spite of its relativelyhigher price as compared with prices a year ago? is able to command about 75 per cent, of the entire trade in our market.That is due to a considerable extent, to this fact, that thereis continuity of supply of Danish butter.  American fresheggs have been arriving in good condition, but so have Americancold stored eggs  and, in the absence of any mark to distinguishthe one from the other, it is suspected that the cold storedare frequently represented as fresh and sold as such.
     The demand for the productions of our own and otherbacon factories in Ayrshire is very quiet owing to the  arrivalfrom Denmark,  Holland,  and Sweden of large  --applies of  baconwhich are being offered at very low prices, with the resultthat genuine Ayrshire bacon is being supplanted In the  market,though its price is Sd. per pound less than that for thecorresponding period of last year.     Top grades of Cheddar and Dunlop oheese are nowrespectively 18/- and 14/- lower In price than at the sameperiod of last year.  The prices being paid at farms for thebest quality are 80/- for Cheddars and 72/- for Dunlops.     Though the total ahipiaent of Canadian oJ*?eese to theUnited Kingdom from 1st May to 3rd November, 1930, ahows adecrease of 58,-52I boxe3 on the quantity for the same dateslast year, quotations are 18/- per cwt. less than a year ago.Scotch oatmeal is now improving in quality as home oats are getting Into better condition, though, owing to the bad weather at harvest their condition  Saves muoh to be desired.It is believed that German pinhead oatmeal is being purchased,then re-milled and mixed with Sootoh and finally sold asScotch oatmeal.   Canadian oatmeal is being offered at priceson a level with those for German.    There has been a furtherslump in the prices of foreign grains.   Plate oats are being offered c.i*,f* Glasgow at  4. 12. 6d. per ton January /Februaryshipment, and Plate maize the same,   Russian barley o,i,f*Glasgow is being offered at  3, 12. 3d. per ton for Decembershipment^  Maize meal due In a fortnight is being offered at 5 per ton which is 30/- a ton oheaper than it was two months ago.   There has been a remarkable drop In the price of ricewhich is now being quoted at the very low price of 9/6d. a owt.c,i,f, Glasgow for January and February shipment.  About theprice of wheat mentioned by Mr. Varley, I might add the price for Canadian wheat has now reached a point which has. not beentouched bofore within the last thirty years.  Our flour millsare running full time, but the demand for flour is not strongeven at the low prices.  Our standard brand of patent flourhas been reduced from 4l/- at the beginning of the year to27/- now, and that reduction is not being reflected in theprice of bread.  From time to time I have represented ourposition in regard to the milk pool in Sootland.  That is amatter of general interest.  It is a scheme for the marketing of milk.  It was supposed to be the beginning of those things.Let me say the soheme has lapsed^ into total confusion.   the milk Selling Agency has definitely failed to retain thesupport of the bulk of the farmers who have an establishedconnection with the distributive trade.   These farmers arenot now selling their milk through the agency with theresult that the supply which reaches the agency is largelyoomposed of surplus milk or that for which a market has tobe found from day to day.  This has oreated the extraordinarysituation that the agency, acting presumably In the interestsof the farmers, in its imperative need to find a market isBelling on behalf of its farmers at 10^d, per gallon, whilethe other farmers are receiving l/2%d. from the distributivetrade.  Such an anomalous state of affairs cannot go on for
9 *? vyany length, of time.  The selling agency must either collapseor receive more support from the farmers.     In regard to the dry goods trade, while our tailoringfactories have been fairly busy, the tweed mill has experienceda very quiet trade.  It is chiefly engaged in making the bestqualities of Scotch tweed, and rather than these, cheaperclothes are required for factory made garments which is thekind of men&apos;s clothing now mostly in demand among  workingpeople.     MR. GILLETT:  Is the milk selling agency the farmersown organisation?     MR, CAIRNS:  Their own organisation and was startedwith material assistance from the Government, but the farmershave been somewhat selfish.  Many of them have good connections with the distributive trade and do not want to pay the levywhich was necessary so as to make the same price all over andthey have withdrawn.  The agency is left with so much of this surplus milk it is compelled to offer it at lOi-d. a gallon.As we know that is below the cost of production.  Ue are getting a retail price which enables us to pay the farmers1/2%-d. and the farmers agency paying 10%d. and the private tradepaying 1/2^-d. to its farmers it oannot go on,     MR. GILLETT:  It was the unfortunate experience wediscovered in England when I was connected with the government committee for loaning money to the Co-operative Societies,that the worst enemies of these Societies were the farmersthemselves who would not support them.     MR. CAIRNS:  Like the Government, we have done, all wecould to aid them, but they would not stick to one another.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR, R. J. HOSE:  I am afraid after the very interestingstatistics the last two gentlemen have favoured us with myremarks will seem extremely bald, but they will also be alittle pessimistic because I am supposed to tell you aboutSouth America and we have no less than five countries therewhich have been or are in a state of revolution;  in additionto that we have Peru where there is now a banking crisis which involves the downfall of the oldest and almost&quot; the largestbank in the country and in which we have all had to come to thereaoue.  Nevertheless, we can set out I think with a goodheart because there are signs of a certain encouraging nature.In the Argentine, for instance, I think we have been told byone of these gentlemen that the wheat crop is going to beprobably a very large one.  There is not muoh doubt it will bevery large, but if it is as large as anticipated most of itwill be used for fuel because they simply oannot grow wheatat the present prices, more especially if you continue to allow the Russian wheat to oome into this country.  The price  of wheathas been for some time and is now so low that if it continues
                                                            9 9 O                                                            w pj O it will be a source of the greatest embarrassment to the Argentine which produces  such a very large quantity for exportation to Europe.      In&quot;the Argentine the new Government is a good Government. It is an excellent and well  considered Government of rich and well-educated people and  the only thing is, I think, it  is  only my personal opinion, they have made a mistake in deciding to have  an election because  - you know i-.ir. Gillett how Governments get turned out at elections  sometimes - it is very likely this Government will not have  the support of the electors because I do  not think it has quite  enough money.   As a matter  of fact, they have had a loan of 100 million pesos, that  is to say,  the equivalent of  8,000,000 and they have had another loan  of  10,000,000 from  the United States and they have got them  on cheap terms because  they are regarded as a Government of high quality.    In Brazil, the position is clarified  to  a certain extent, but it s-uill has those difficulties, non- political, which existed before the revolution that lasted  only twenty three or twenty four  days;  that is to say,  coffee everywhere and not  enough people to drink it and that  remains the position and  I am afraid will remain the position  for a very  long time.   The quantity of coffee they have is  all stated in this Report which  I will hand in^   Sr. Getulio Vargas has taken  office and  a very good President too, and  we think in a little time things will settle down.    In the meantime the banks  are now allowing a little withdrawal  from current accounts and deposits and the purchase and  sale  of  bills I regret to say is  monopolised in the hands of the Banco de Brazil.      In  Chile there is not much to be said except  in regard to one thing that Interests  everybody,  that is the new  combination for nitrate which is  called  &quot;Cosach&quot;t,  some of you may remember it.   They have  now reached a  stage where, all the arrangements are definitely  completed excepting  the raising of the necessary  13,000,000 which  is going to be found in New York and we are assured  with all  confidence  there  will  be no difficulty in  getting  it.   It will be very  interesting  as seeing how an industry which was in  the hands  of  some  seventy different  companies or persons  can be  concentrated  into  one hand  and has had  to be  concentrated  because  of  the  difficulty of producing  in  these  days at  prices at which you can  make  a profit.      Peru  I have  already  referred to and  the  other  small countries,  if  I may say  so with  all  respect, have  nothing very interesting except  just  some observations which  I will hand in and  they will no  doubt be circulated^.      MR. GILLETT:   Liay I  just  ask you one question.    I take note  of your  point  about  the election which  is very sound advice.   The point I wanted to  ask  you is why do you think the Argentine did not take  up with  the  British Government  that. proposal  that Lord  D&apos;Abernon suggested  if  they  are  so  burdened with  wheat, why  do  not  they  press  on with a  scheme  of  that  kind for  an interchange  of goods?* See Appendix p. 52.t Compania de Salitie de Chile.
    MR. HOSE:  When that arrangement was made I found it interesting reading, &quot;but very impracticable.   We werebuying all we wanted from the Argentine without any arrangement for a special quantity.   The Argentine wasbuying all it wanted from us, all it could possibly take,buying elsewhere if they could get cheaper goods and Ireally did not see that there was any good coming out of the proposition.   I did not like to say so then, but now it has fallen to pieces I can say so.   I thought it was much cryand little wool.   I do not see how we can expect them to buy from us  8,000,000 worth of goods at a price higher thanthat at which they can be supplied by some other country.On the other hand, we should certainly buy from them all thewheat and other cereals we could or meat at prices whichsuited this market.     MR. GIT.TiF.TT:   Yes, I follow that, out what I wasthinking was whether the idea could not have been one theycould have found, in altering certain items in the proposal?to be helpful, with all this burden of wheat they have.  Iam looking at it from their standpoint.     MR. HOSE:  When they first met, Lord D&apos;Abernon on theone side and the President and his friends on the other side, there was strong friendship and a great enthusiasm,and they mutually arranged to do something which would bevery beneficial to both without thinking out itspracticability and the next day or the next week when theydiscussed it with their fellows they found this would not do,&apos;the other fellow is going to get the pull over us1.   Alittle discussion and the thing was dropped.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. JOHN SANDERSON:  Wool October sales in Australiawere marked by sustained demand for &quot;better classes with prices equal to and occasionally slightly above closingSeptember rates.   The Conference of Woolgrowers Council andWoolselling Brokers considered reducing offerings and extending sales, and have fixed Sydney offerings from 10thNovember to Christmas Vacation at 10,500 bales.   It was also decided to terminate season in middle of May.     Wheat exports this season 451: million bushels comparedwith 80 millions last season.   The Acting Minister forMarkets has convened a Conference of Ministers ofAgriculture and of representatives of co-operative andproprietary wheat distributing organisations, growers andmillers for 12th November to consider Australian wheatposition generally.     Flour exports this season were 420,000 tons comparedwith 492,000 last season.     Butter exports from Australia 1st July to 31st october to United Kingdom were 11,674 tons, to other countries,873 tons compared with 6,983 and 1,813 tons respectivelyfor corresponding period last year.
9 0 i\ o y     Exports of eggs to Britain this season were 163,160cases compared with 100,000 corresponding period last season.All States except Victoria are approaching the end of season,Victoria probably exporting till shortly before Christmas.     The revenue for October from the Customs is  2,750.000,a decrease of  800,000;  postal revenue is  1,000,000 which shows an increase of  64,500 compared with last year.   ?romJuly to October the Customs revenue is  10,000,000, a decreaseof  4,750,000;  the postal revenue is  4,500,000, an increaseof  72,000 compared with last year.     The Acting Treasurer&apos;s proposals consequent on theprospect of a deficit estimated at from  8,000,000 to 10,000,000 include increase of primage duty from 2  to  per cent;  lowering of exemption on income tax from propertyfrom  300 to  100, vanishing  .at  200:  super tax of 7-j percent on all income from property;  further increase of 6 percent in tax on income from personal exertion exceeding  500;special income tax ranging from 10 to 15 per cent on federalservants&apos; salaries over  725;  new duty on tea 4d. per lb,bulk, 6d per lb. packets not exceeding 20 lbs;  Customs dutyon tobacco increase of 2/2d;  excise duty an increase of 2/-per lb.     The Bank clearances in round figures from 1st january to 3rd November:  Sydney  732,000,000;  Melbourne  601,000,000a decrease of  148,000,000 and  91,000,000 respectively.     Australia has been occupying some space in the paperslately and I am authorised to say that those in control are definitely opposed to postponement of loan payments and against inflation of currency.   Vigorous efforts are beingmade to ensure the adoption of this advice and the events ofthe last week indicate these efforts are succeeding.BUILDING.     MR.  T. BARRQN:  In regard to building there is no improvement.   As a matter of fact, the unemployment has considerably increased.   It stands now at 129,000 which isan increase on over a year ago of five per cent, not certainlysuch a big increase as in&apos;certain other industries.   Theonly bright spot is in the plans passed.   There is an increase from a year ago in the corresponding period which is endingnow, not a very big increase, but it is on the right side;the regrettable factor in the figures of plans passed isthe small amount shown for industrial purrposes.    factories and workshops only total  201,700 and shops, offices,warehouses and other business premises  570,000 out of atotal of  6,662,000 a showing of course relative to thedepression in industry generally.   In regard to housing, it ishoped with the beginning of getting into stride with legislation that was passed earlier this year, there will be some considerable improvement, commencing at least with the beginningof the new year.   I shall hand these figures in.**See Appendix p.40.       -19-
Q* ii A.SHIPBUILDING-.     In regard to shipbuilding, there again we have heardalready from Sir Walter Raine the position is very had,although looking at the figures supplied from this departmentit must he admitted that the tonnage under construction isnot greatly down, in fact, it is higher than two years agoin this particular period.   The difficulty with one in myposition is I cannot get any figures relating to ordershooked.   Shipbuilders like other business people for various reasons do not always publish on the day they book an orderthat they have done so and our experience in the past isthat these orders come in cycles.   There is no regularturnover from them and there might be a quarter or six monthswhich show very poor returns as far as orders placed areconcerned, but it might be balanced in the next six months.Again the one outstanding feature I think was theconfirmation of this department s arrangement with theOunard Company which has allowed that work to be set in motion, and I think everybody will agree that is an excellentway of using the State credit.   On the other side of itthere is something like 35 per cent unemployment in the shipbuilding industry.   That unemployment bears no relationwhatever to production in the industry.   It has no relativevalue in comparing unemployment with the production of theindustry, as never again I am sure will the shipbuilding industry be able to employ the total number of men at onceowing to the development of the industry, the mechanisationwhich has been more expedited in that industry than in anyother.   Men will be permanently displaced and arising outof that, this week there was a conference between shipbuildersand trade unionists and also representatives of the new company which was formed to buy up redundant shipyards, tosee if any arrangement or agreement could be arrived at inregard to some compensation to men displaced from this industry.   I do not think any of you would expect that any arrangement was arrived at, nor is there any likelihood Iam afraid of any agreement being arrived at to compensatethe ordinary workmen who are displaced owing to the methods,and to the right methods possibly, of this new development in the shipbuilding industry.COTTON.     SIR K3JSK3TH ST3WART:   I think generally thepresent situation in the Indian trade is pretty well known.During October, the first week was a bad week and then itimproved right away through to the end of October and thingsbegan to look a little bit cheerful.   At the beginning ofNovember there was a regular slump again all round and itis quite evident that the course of trade is following thecourse of the raw material.   During October, after the first week, raw material was rising pretty steadily and people were inclined to buy while they thought raw material wascheap and likely to go up.   In the early part of this monthit went down again and business fell off.   It looks as ifthere was a pretty large potential demand waiting whenconfidence is restored.   That applies really to almost everymarket.   Mr. Varley referred to China.  The position in Chinswas the same as in other countries, that during October there
was a considerable increase in trade^and prospects looked  abit better, especially as in the south and middle part  ofChina the rice crop is astonishingly good this year.  It is better than it has been for a very long time and in the northI also hear good reports of the crops.   In a country likeChina which consumes most of its own agricultural productsthat is a very important point so things did look better,  butat the beginning of November there was a quite extraordinarysudden depression in a week chiefly caused by the efforts  ofthe Central Government to alter the dates of the New  Year  andthe settling dates and the bank dates and everything  else.Needless to say they were quite incapable of doing so.   you cannot change customs in a place like China in a short  time.They tried to fix the New Year settling period and theNew Year generally to correspond with our Western year  insteadof later in January or February as is usual and we have *not quite seen what the effect of the Government giving up  thatidea has been.   In the meantime China has gone just  as wrongas most other markets.   At the beginning of this month thingsgot depressed again, but there seems a good potential demandwhen once the raw material steadies itself and people^ getsome confidence in it;  otherwise we have nothing special  toreport.     MR. H.W. LEE:  Mr. Chairman, I agree very largely  withthe report which Sir ICennethhas given and in the fine trade we find the saaae state of things in October that Sir  Kennethhas found in the coarse trade, that is, for two or threeweeks we sold well;  we sold probably equivalent to full production, but those extra orders were largely caused  bythe rise in the raw material and I think they were more anaccumulation of orders that manufacturers and merchants werecovering in than they were an indication of any great furtheramount of business, and I do not thinic that those orders will result in any very great increase in employment.   Of course,we should have a rather better position of things if  everyoneconnected with the trade had confidence in the price  of the raw material and of the finished article.   That would improve our position, but we never can hope to have a realrecovery in the textile trade until we have a very considerably higher level of prices than obtains at the presenttime.   You have to remember the customers of Lancashiretextiles are very largely the agrioulturists, and ycu havetoday cotton and wool and wheat and rubber and almost everycommodity that is produced by the people who buy Lancashiretextiles at below the cost of production and as long  as thatremains the people who ought to be taking our goods cannot possibly have money which will enable them to have sufficientto keep us properly running.   The only hope we have  is ageneral rise of prices which will enable our customers  to resume the purchases which they ought to make and which todaythey are quite unable to make.   That is to my mind the generalsituation.   I do not know whether I dare so say, I think  to acertain extent it is wrapped up with the monetary policy ofthe world,   I kno^ the Government are investigating  thatat the present time, and I know you do not want me to begindiscussing it here.   Of course, in Lancashire we have  two great anxieties at the moment, one is a very present  anxiety,that is India.   If the relations of this country and india are going to remain on a bad footing and if the determination of the Indians to get their material from any other sourcethey can than from England is going to continue, then youwill have to visualise a very considerable permanent  reductioneven of the spindles and looms in Lancashire that are
3 9 9O O orunning today, and that undoubtedly must he a  very greatcause of anxiety to us in Lancashire,  and then anotherdifficulty which does not occur yet, hut which is  loomingin the distance, and I am very glad that Sir Walter Rainereferred to it, is the Russian one.    Russia is importing,I believe with the help of the British Government,  the  export credits, a vast amount of textile machinery.   They are wordingthat machinery 21 hours a day and they are working it seven days a week.   They are paying their labourers with paperorders for the amount of food and. the  amount of clothes thatare just absolutely necessary to keep  them alive and the consequence is that when that machinery gets really established and in full work they will be able to  accept prices fortextiles which will be quite impossible for any other countryto compete with.   We have taken this  up with the  Governmentand the Russian Government have given a promise they will notexport textiles to Britain or to the Dominions or  Colonies of britain and as far as it goes, if they keep it, that is an advantage, but one thing we have not been able to  get from them is a promise if they export to any other country theywill put a clause in their contract preventing that country from exporting to Britain or to British Dominions  preventingthem re-exporting.   My firm conviction is that if theGovernment would taiie a strong hand Russia is  so anxious todeal with them that they could get a trade agreement, whichis what we want, a real trade agreement to that effect, andthey might get that Clause put in.   I think it is a mostimportant and necessary action for the Government  toendeavour to take.   The Government, of course, is aGovernment of great consideration to all other countries,and it is not a Government that lixes  to take  any  actionwhich might appear to contain a threat, but personally, ifI were in their position, I should run the risk of gettingpulled up for making a threat, and I should try to get  thatarrangement put through.   The president of the&apos;Board ofTrade is fully aware of the position of things, because we   ,in Manchester have had correspondence  with the Russians onthe subject, which he permitted us to have, and we sent himcopies of all the letters and kept him fully posted on  thesubject.   I do believe that prompt action in that matter at the present time is possible, and might have a  very  good effect.     MR. GILLSTT:  That point is before the president,but a note will be made of your remarks, and his attentiondrawn to them.                     IRON AND STEEL.     MR. FALMSLEY:  I am afraid that  the Iron andSteel trade is going from bad to worse with a prospect,  ifnot a certainty, of worse still in store for us.     In October the pig iron production fell to a  newlow level of 415,000 tons, which is at the rate of lessthan 5 million tons per annum, which  is less than  half our capacity.   V/e have only 96 furnaces  in blast, which  is  the lowest on record for a very long time.
0 Q ^*J *5    Steel production has gone down to 512,500 tons, or about million tons per annum., against a capacity of over 12 million tons.   Many steel works have either closed altogether, or are working spasmodically.     The outlook in all districts is bad.   The home demandcontinues to decline, and there Is no present sign of a revival in the export trade.   The revolutions in theArgentine and Brazil have interfered with important railorders which we had hoped to secure, and they seem to beindefinitely postponed.   There are perhaps slight signs ofimprovement in future business with Canada, but it is not ofany great importance.     Ship building continues absolutely lifeless.   None ofour ship building customers seems to be booking any new orders,and of course there is no buying.     Home prices of steel remain unchanged.   It was not considered by the British Steel Makers that any modestreduction would bring new business, and of course any fallmore than a few shillings per ton in present prices, based onthe present rate of production, would involve heavy losses tothe makers.     On the Continent there has been a further severe fall Inprices, and In many cases they must now be below pre-war.Pig iron on the Continent has not fallen quite as rapidly asfinished material, because the Pig  Iron Associations inFrance and Western Europe generally managed to hold together^They have now been dissolved, and there Is serious priceoutting for pig iron.   Still lower prices ars expected.     A few orders have been placed for constructional work,bridge building and so on, which have been freely reported inthe newspapers, but the effect of those on the steel makerswill only be felt over a long period, they are contracts whichextend over two or three years and  they do not really makevery much difference.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:  with regard to shipping, I am sorry to say that there is.no improvement to report.   The positionof the freight market in all directions is very disappointing.The index number for freights for October was again lower,and now stands at 22% below the 1913 average.   It is usual to anticipate some seasonal advance in the autumn, but this year the reverse has taken place.     After the heavy chartering from Russia which I reportedpreviously there was about a fortnight&apos;s inactivity, after which the Russians again came into the market about ten daysago and took some further 30 or 40 steamers for November/December loading at from 2/- to 2/6 less than they were previously paying.   Chartering has, however, ceased again.In some quarters it is thought that further shipments arelikely to be made, but I think this will depend largely on the grain market here and the disposal of the grain which mr, Varley mentioned as being stored in this  country and onthe Continent,
      Chartering has been fairly active from the Argentine butrates remain very low.   Although we are so near to the new crop  charterers are not disposed to take up tonnage for thenew season for which only a small advance is quoted on presentlow rates.     The political disturbances in Brazil caused considerabledisorganisation both in export and import trade, but present indications point to a speedy return to normal.   financial conditions, however, are a difficulty.      In the East there has been a small but perceptible increasein the enquiry for tonnage, and there has been more movementboth from Calcutta and Bombay.   The main feature in themarket has been Soya beans from Vladivostock for which a fairtrade has been done, but on a freight level which cannot beremunerative,     East outwards there is no improvement.   India ispursuing a hand-tO&quot;mouth policy, and although not so strongthe boycott is still effective.     For  Cast Africa a fair business is passing at lower rates.     For Australia a steady business has been done for allpositions as far ahead as March, but rates of freight havebeen  steadily declining.   The majority of the steamers taken up will have to proceed from this side in ballast, and on the freight levels at present ruling there can be nothing but a loss on the venture, except possibly in the case of very largeships.   A fair business from Australia has also been done to indian and far- Eastern destinations for early shipment.   Thefinancial difficulties and the tariff increases have had an adverse effect on trade generally.     Despite the approaching closing of navigation there isbut little demand to ship grain from Montreal, some steamershaving had to leave in ballastc   Last year&apos;s export of grainwas the poorest since 1920,, and this year to November it is12 million bushels less than last year.     From the United States grain freights are practicallynon-existent, and other business is of a precarious nature.There has been some demand for coals to the Mediterranean andSouth America.      Cuba sugar has not chartered anything for a considerable time.      In outward coa.1 freights, the tendency during the monthhas been  steadily downwards both for the Mediterranean andSouth America.   South African coal has almost  completelyousted British coal from the Eastern ports.      Shipbuilding has been referred to already,   I understand,from  what I hear, that the only orders placed during the lastmonth are for 1 large tanker for American account and two small cargo boats probably intended for coasting trade.   the record of building  commenced is beginning to show the result
9 9 I?&apos;iJ tj 0of the absence of new ordering.   In the quarter to September30th the figure of 160,000 tons is only half that of a year agofor the same quarter.   Tonnage under construction in GreatBritain and Ireland up to the quarter ending 30th September,was 1,116,000 against 1,448,000 up to the same date a year ago.     As regards laid up tonnage, as mentioned a month ago, theRussian demand had taken seme steamers to sea, but there is atpresent a determined effort on the part of ship owners to getthe ships laid up again, and there is difficulty in findingsuitable berths for them.   The Tyne, I understand, is quitefull, they cannot take any more boats to lie up.   The figures,though difficult to obtain with accuracy, appear to remainabout stationary, and a very large amount of modern tonnage is included in the list of laid up.tonnage,     I put In the usual statistical figures.^WOOL.     MR, HAMILTON:  With regard to the woollen and worstedindustry, I am able to report a definite improvement in certain sections of the trade during the month of October,   The lowprice of merino wool in Australia has restored a measure ofconfidence amongst users and combing wools are sellingremarkably well.     The policy of manufacturers and spinners during the wholeof 1930 has been to take all available orders even at very cutprices, enter them in the order books, and leave the coveringof them till the last moment.   This procedure has beendictated, not only by a belief in the downward trend of prices,but also by uncertainty as to whether some hitch might not occur in the execution of the orders,   This prudent policy has been entirely justified, firstly by the continuous fall in prices,and secondly by the weakened financial status of the general body of buyers.   The present relative steadiness of wool valueshas brought about a covering movement amongst users, which hasswollen the normal seasonal purchases and enlivened the publicauctions in Australia,     As is customary in such circumstances, the demand affectsin the first place fine combing merino wool, then cross-bredcombing wool and lastly short clothing wools.   Up to thepresent, the two last named categories have not benefitted, and still remain in a very depressed condition not only in Englandbut throughout the world.     The imposition of the new  Canadian tariff has resulted Ina fevered rush to get goods shipped by the middle of November.     One or two \;est Riding manufacturers have decided totransfer their plant to Canada, and others are contemplatingsimilar action.* See Appendix p. 48.
IMDIAH TRASS.     MR.  LINDSAY:   I will take,  first,  the crop position inIndia,  beo&amp;use,  from that point  of view,  I have quite a favourablereport  to make.     The past monsoon has been good,  and welldistributed,  and the orops are coming forward on the  whole fairlywell.   The slump in prices which seem to have started aboutAugust  or September of last year - is shown by a series of indexnumbers whioh I  have here and which give an idea of the general effect  of the fall comparing August 1929 with August  1930.Taking  prices in July 1914 at 100, cereals have fallen from 128to 103, pulses from 149 to 110,  tea from 132 to 102,  raw jutefrom 99 - that is to say below the pre-war price even in August1929 -  to 53 in August 1930 - just over half the pre-war price:jute goods have fallen from 130to 93, raw ootton from 143 to 88,cotton  goods from 162 to 138, and hides and skins from 105 to78 - just over three quarters of the pre-war price.   The generalindex number was 143 in August 1929, and it was 114 in August1930,  The raw jute prices have fallen very much more than themanufactured jute prices, and so also the raw cotton prices havefallen  more than the cotton goods, but it is natural that the rawmaterial should fall faster than the manufactured goods in whiohthey only constitute a proportion of the ultimate price.     That fall of prices has had its natural re-action on trade.Taking  the latest available figure, that of September 1930, andcomparing with August 1929, our total imports into India havefallen from  15,000,000 to  8,000,000 during the two months,August  and September, a fall of vei&quot;y nearly half.  Exports havenot fallen by so much - from  20,000,000 to  14,000,000.  Thereis very little change in net imports of gold and silver.  Thebalance of trade, thanks to the import ratio having fallen faster than the export ratio, is  slightly higher at  5 million inSeptember 1930, oomparod with  4 million in August 1929.  In spiteof that, the Exchange position is weak, but the determination ofthe Government of India to sell &quot;reverse councils1, if and whenthe Exchange reaches the lever gold point, has had its effect in maintaining the Exchange just over that point.     I  might add, for confidential information, that there hatebeen a good deal of remittance of funds out to India for investment in Indian Treasury Bills to obtain the higher  interestavailable there.  Those transactions have had no effect whatsoeveron Exchange, because oach  outward remittance lias been made againsta return remittance three  or six months later.     In regard to our main staple lines of trade, tea  showsreduced exports to  the United Kingdom, which is perhaps all to  thfcgood, as this is rather a  saturated market, while there have been increased exports both to  Russia  and the United States.   That alsois very much&quot; to the good.  The general exports from  India remainabout the same as they were  last  year.     I think it was Sir Kenneth who mentioned  a heavy  rice oropin China - unfortunately,  from our point of view - paralleled by a
99ov qj (jrecord production of rice  in Japan and Korea.  Our exportsto the United Kingdom and  curiously enough to China too,have increased,  while exports to Japan and the Continent havefallen off,  hut  there Is a general increase of 25-1 in our total exports.  In cotton  there is an increase of exports tothe United Kingdom.  Japan is taking less:  and  our total exports are slightly less  than in 1929,  about the same level as 1928.     On the import side, cotton piece goods have fallen offvery distinctly  all round  from 794 million yards during the5 months (April  to August) of 1929 to 539 million during the5 months of 1930.  Cotton  yarns have also fallen.  machinery is rather more hopeful. We have bought  nearly  4 millionworth of machinery during  the same 5 months of 19 30 from theUnited Kingdom as compared with  4 million actually during thesame period of the previous year, but that  4 million  represents the United kingdom&apos;s share of the total  trade of  5 million this year, that is to say  that four fifths of the whole tradeis done with this country.     CAPTAIN LYTTELTON:   I should like  to hear  something ofthe effect of the fall in the price of  silver on the purchasing power In India, whether it has  resulted  in  decreasedimports?     MR. LINDSAY?  I do not think it does,  really,  because we have not got a silver basis to our Exchange.......     CAPTAIN LYTTELTON!  Surely a lot of the  savings  ofIndia are represented by accumulated silver,  and if the valuecf your savings declines surely your purchasing  power tends to decline as well?     MR. LINDSAY:   That is so.     CAPTAIN LYTTELTON:   Do not you think that  that Is a major reason?     MR. LINDSAY:  I should have  said that a more seriousfactor  in our purchasing power was the competition of countries on a real silver basis.  For example crushers in this countrytend to buy  Soya beans  from China because of the reducedsterling value  of  Soya  beans rather than ground nuts orcompeting products from India.  That, I think,  has hit us onthe trade side  perhaps  more than  the reduced general value ofIndiafs savings.                          EMPLOYMENT.     MR. HILTON:  During October there was a further continuousincrease in the numbers unemployed on the registers ofEmployment Exchanges.  The total number Increased during themonth by 75,812, from 2,161,689 to 2,237,501.  The numberswholly unemployed increased by 107,556 during the month, andthe number temporarily stopped decreased by 31,744.
9 9 0t? tj %j     During the month the number of men on the registers increased by 86,168 while the number of womendecrease^ bv 8,060 and the number of juveniles by 2,296.     Considering the month&apos;s rise geographically,in the London, South Eastern, and South Westerndivisions the numbers unemployed Increased steadily duringthe month, and these increases were almost certainly dueto seasonal causes.   The increase In these three divisions amounted to 31,197 out of the total of 65,812.     In the Midlands Division there was a slightnet increase.   The Midlands Division includes thePotteries and all the Birmingham trades.   A decrease of5,062 In the first half of the month was off-set by anincrease of nesrly 8,000 in the seconcj half.   In theNorth Western Division there was a net increase of about ,000 - that includes the Cotton industry - while in eachof the other Divisions there were net increases in thenumbers unemployed.   In every case, however, fluctuationsoccurred during the month up and down.   In the NorthEastern Division there was a net increase of 19,000.In Scotland there was an Increase of about 14,000 owingvery largely to the continued depression in the jviteindustry at Dundee.   In Wales there was an Increase ofabout 13,000.     Considering now the calculations we make as to the number of Insured persons in employmentp thenumber on 27th October was provisionally estimated to beabout 113,300 less than at 22nd September, a monthearlier, and about 733,000 leS3 than a year previously.     There was a decline in the coal miningindustry, both the numbers wholly unemployed and thenumbers temporarily stopped showing an increase.   Thenumbers unemployed increased also in the iron and steelindustry, in general engineering, in ship building and ship repairing and in the building trade.  There was aslight improvement in the motor vehicle industry, while in the cotton industry the numbers unemployed fell by about13,300, and in woollen and worsted by 3,600.                 NON-FERROUS METALS.     CAPTAIN LYTTELT0N:   The consumption of copperin the United Kingdom Is fairly satisfactory.   Thefigures in the table circulated are probably not entirelyrepresented by the consumption.   The increase in theimports of copper towards the end of the year are probablydu?j to the abnormally low prices, and I think manufacturershave tended to stock with more confidence than they haveshown for some time.     A curtailment of production of 23,000 tons per month has been arranged in America, and as far as wecan see this will about balance the current supplies withthe current demands.   The copper industry as a whole willprobably show a considerable decline in consumption after
steady increases for some years.   The consumption of copper has been going up by about Q% per annum for sometime, but I think that this year the consumption over thewhole world will show a considerable decline.     The consumption of tin is everywhere extremelybad.   The tin plate industry in America ia passing throughthe worst period we have seen for many years,  and the sameapplies in this country,   The price of tin iii to-day wellbelow the cost of production, and we estimate  that atpresent prices only 15)&amp; of the tin mining industry canwin tin at a profit.     The position of zinc is particularly bad, andI do not think that the galvanised industry has ever been insuch a bad state as at present.   For instance, theconsumption of the South Wales area alone has  fallen from about 4,000 tons of spelter per month to 1,000.   I believethat the exports of galvanised material from America andthis country are normally about 895,000, and this yearthey have, fallen to about 445,000 - i.u3t about half.  Thatis due to the decreased purchases in the East as well aato the troubles in South America.     On the other hand, the consump tion of lead appears tobe fairly satisfactory, and this io very difficult toexplain in view of the fact that building activity seemsto have declined.     The use of lead for pigments,however, is very well, maintained, and that is very largely due to the fact that when times are bad people paint theirown houses and fences etc., and so lead continues to be bought although contractors may not be giving such large orders.     Broadly -speaking, with the possible exceptionof copper, none of the non-ferrous metals can be suppliedat these prices in sufficient quantities to supply a normaldemand or the reduced demand in the world.   That isespecially true of tin  and zinc.   As 1 say,  according toour estimate 85% of the world&apos;s production of tin is produced at a loss.     MR. GILLETT:   I think you may like to know that yesterday I was talking to Lord Kirkley,  who was headof the Mission to South Africa and who returned to thiscountry on Monday.   One of the things which seemed to impress him very much was the warmth of the reception whichthe Mission received in that country - not alone from,as one would naturally expect, the English population, but also from the -Dutch population.  Their reception atBloemfontein was exceedingly kind and friendly, and theyeven found one place where posters were up urging the people to purchase British good3 because of the advantage of theBritish market.   Those posters had been put up by theDutch farmers of the district.  We are hoping to have somemeetings in the country at which members of the Delegationwill speak, and if any of you think that in your parts of thecountry such a meeting would be ofJ any use I should be very glad if you would communicate with the Department of OverseasTrade.     I am much obliged to you for your attendance  and reports tnis morning.  (Proceedings terminated).
APPENDIX,MR. MITCHELL sent the following report:-                         SCOTLAND.Coal.     In the last week there has been a little improvement  in therequirements for House Coal but there is a very poor demand  for industrial Coal and for all classes of washed material,  and prices are lower.  There has been a good deal of idle time atthe Collieries.     The output fluctuates from a little over to a little  under600,000 tons per week and the Miners employed remain at about92,500.     Polish competition is, if anything, more severe and contracts for next year are being taken at very lew prices.     The Marketing Scheme proposed by the Board of Trade has beensent to the Coalowners.  As far as can be seen the provisions forminimum prices will be ineffective owing to the differences  inthe Railway carriage from the Collieries and to low prices whichmust be accepted for foreign shipment if any considerable proportion of the Export trade is to be retained.     For the month of September the ascertainment for Wagespurposes shew a slight improvement, the loss being 3.25 per  tonas compared with 5.33 per ton in August.Fig Iron.     The output was 23,400 tons in September as compared with56,000 tons in September 1929.     It will be less in October.  There are fewer furnaces inblast.     In September the imports of rig Iron were 18,428 tors of which12,207 tons were from India.Steel.     The works are on very short time and most of them are working two shifts per day instead of three, and only for  partof each week.     The output of Steel for September was 104,000 tons ascompared with 141,600 tons in September 1929.     The imports continue heavy:  The imports cf Plates for september were 3,088 tons, although the Plate Mills in Scotlandare working at very much under capacity.     The export  demand is poor.  It should be noted that for thewhole country the exports of Iron and Steel from Germany,France and Belgium are considerably ahead of those from GreatBritain.     The Scrap position remains as in previous months.   Theimports into Scotland for September were 14,041 tons of which,200 tons were from the Argentine, against, it is understood, anold contract.  The exports from Scotland were 2,327 tons of  which
2,050 tons were to the United States - apparently specialmaterial at  considerably above the ordinary ocrap price.     For the whole country Imports of Scrap are  in excess of  the exports.     The Tube Works are getting poor work in most classes ofTubes.   There is no improvement in the Australian trade.IRON AND STEEL.     MR. PUGH sent the following report:     Trade, generally, showed no improvement during October;  if anything, the position at the end of the month was worse and reports received are of a very depressing nature.     The pig iron trade in England appears to have developedslightly at the latter end of the month,  the shipments cf pig ironfrom the Tees for October exceeded the exports for any previous month this year, and the sales of hematite iron.,  both for domestic consumption and for export, were comparativelysatisfactory.  In Scotland, however, the position was worse,another works having been closed down, making IS idle works,  tvoof which are being dismantled.     Unfortunately, the heavy steel trades cannot show a changefor the better.  In the North Eastern and Lincolnshire areasemployment has been much about the same as for September,excepting that at the Frodingharn Iron and Steel Company&apos;s works the Siemens Department has been closed, thereby putting out of commission two Talbot furnaces.   At the Rotherham works of theUnited Steel Companies, only one furnace out of seven is inoperation, and at the Templeborough works of the same company,only six out of fourteen are working.     In Monmouthshire and South Wales, the steel trade getsappreciably worse.  At Cardiff, Ebhw Vale and Dowlais approxi-mately 5.000 steel-workers are unemployed; of the other two works in Monmouthshire, one worked fully during the month and the otherhad its plant idle at the end of September, but half the numberof furnaces worked 5 shifts during the first four weeks ofOctober.     Of 84 furnaces in the South West Wales area,  26 only were at work during the last week of October.   Seven important works were completely idle, and the Hawarden works of Messrs. JohnSummers and Sons has only 4 melting furnaces working out of afull complement of 18.     No change is reported in the wrought iron trade and at mostestablishments the workpeople are working less than half time.     Nine important steel sheet works are completely idle, whilenone of  the others are working mere than 75ft of capacity.     The tinplate trade which has hitherto maintained a fairdegree of employment is now falling into the same unsatisfactorycondition as the steel sheet trade.
MOTOR INDUSTRY,     SIR WILLIAM MORRIS sent the following report:-     So far as it is possible to forecast  the future fromthe tendencies of the recent Motor  Exhibition,  it may be saidthat, broadly, the demand for the cheaper  types of carssomewhat exceeded anticipations.   Factories  are comparativelybusy, at least temporarily,  on the  output  of  the new season1smodels.     The demand for the medium priced cars (about  400 -  600)appears to be somewhat the same as  a year  ago.   As regardsmore expensive types, however, there seems to have been a very definite decrease in potential demand,  and output will undoubtedly be considerably less than twelve  months ago.     As regards Export, Australian  difficulties are intensifiedand though the proportion of business available for Britishcars shews a tendency to increase,  market  conditions in thisDominion are unparalleled, and there still remain considerable quantities of American cars which are being liquidated atvirtually bankrupt prices.     New Zealand, South Africa and  India shew greater promise,but in all markets there are still  excessive  American stocks.The Northern Continent shews some signs of promise forcertain lines, and great interest is being taken by agents in British products.     In the case of commercial vehicles, the  demand for allclasses continues to fall, and it cannot be said there are any indications ot improvement- during the  next year.     Demand for imported cars or commercial vehicles continuesto be insignificant.     Finally, it may be said that considerable anxiety existson the possibility of maintaining output to the programmeconsidered necessary to justify generally reduced prices.Practically all manufacturers view  the future with considerable anxiety, unless greater evidence of confidence in Industry generally can be secured during the coming months.     SIR CYRIL HURCOMB  sent the following report:-     The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor  cycles)newly registered in September, 1930, was 1,028 more  than  inthe corresponding period of 1929.This increase is made up as underIncrease (*)   or decrease (-)Goods vehiclesMotor HackneyBOther VehiclesCars taxed on horse power* 1,510    380      2    100* 1,028     Motor cycles newly registered in September,  1930,  sheweda aecr&amp;JtBe of 303 com?ared,with September,  1929.
o r 9o L J)                        ENGINEERING.     MR. ROT/LAND sent the following report:-     The latest statistics available/ble ai-e those in respect ofthe month of September, and the relevant data, compared withthose for August and for the corresponding month of the two previous years, are summarised in our usual Abstract (see Table1 appended).  The general picture, as presented by the figures,further emphasises the steady deterioration which has progressedmonth by month during the current year.   This setback in theengineering industry is, of course, only part of the general depression which lies particularly heavily upon our nationalbasic industries, and from which unfortunately no sign of relief is as yet apparent.  The prospect for this winter istherefore very unpromising, and we can only hope for someultimate alleviation of economic conditions, which will effect,or at least initiate, a recovery in the fortunes of industry.     The Abstract of statistics contained in Table 1 constitutes a very useful comparative survey of the present position withthe respective situations one year and two years ago.   On thewhole the position twelve months ago was somewhat better thanin September 1928;  but the current statistics, for September1930, reveal how very considerably we have fallen back since.This is seen very directly in the records of iron and steel production, and of our export trade in iron and steelmanufactures and in machinery.     The shipbuilding statisticswhich are included in the table provide further demonstration,in revealing the very pronounced slump in shipbuildingactivity, which is confirmed by the greatly augmented totalof shipping tonnage now laid up idle in our sea ports.   Stillmore striking are the figures of unemployment given In thefourth section of the table, which show that the general position  (apart from coalmining) is about twice as badstatistically as it was twelve months  ago.    Thus, the index of unemployment among insured workers  in the general engineering trades is now 20.0? ;  in September IP29, it was10.03, and in September 1928, 10.3:1c   The index for theengineering industry as a whole now Btands at 19     and has gone definitely above the general index for the whole country,which at present is 13,1?$,     It is somewhat paradoxical to find that Bank Rate whichat present is at the relatively low rate of 33, stood a yearago at the peak level of S-g-vS, and in September 1928, was 4i?&apos;.The Board of Trade index numbers of wholesale prices, as givenin the table, reveal the remarkable decline in general price levels which has been taking place in  the last two years.     In Table 2  (appended) will be found our usual quarterlycompilation, which summarizes the export and import trade ofGreat Britain in the engineering and allied metal products.The statistics are given for the completed nine months of thepresent year, compared with the corresponding periods of thethree preceding years.  It will be seen that in declaredvalue the total exports of these commodities has declinea this
year to almost  135 millions.     This figure,  when equatedalong with the totals for the preceding years,  on the common &apos;basis of the 1924 value ^ 100),  shows that the declaredvalue this year is only very slightly above that of 1924;  but when allowance is made, (on the usual lines of  the Board ofTrade estimate of revaluation) for the effect of changes in price levels, we find that, owing to the steady reduction of price levels since 1924, the volume of trade in the presentyear is actually some 16% greater&quot;Than in 1924.    Turning to imports, we find that the combined value of the imports has fallen from  78 millions last year to  70.5 millions in thecurrent year, but here again owing to reduction in price levels,  -the volume of trade has not fallen by quite so  muchcomparatively.     The export tonnage of machinery in the first nine monthsof this year has totalled 366,997 tons, which is almost 50,000tons less than tho total at this time last year, viz,,, 416,441tons,     The total declared value is  35.9 millions against 40.1 millions last year, the respective average values per  tonbeing therefore  98.0 and  96.1.    Imports of machinery todate are only slightly below the peak figure recorded in 19 29,the respective tonnages for the first nine months being 81,706tons, and 85,147 tons;   the declared values are  13.8 millions and  14,,3 millions respectively, and the average values per  ton 169.2 and  167.4.     The recent publication of the Annual Trade Returns inrespect of the year 1929 has enabled us to compile our specialannual Analysis of the Exports of Machinery by individualmarkets.   This will be found in Table 3.  (see   special sheetattached).   The total exports for 1929 in tonnage failed only by a very small margin to equal the record post-war- figurereturned in 1928, the total being, in round figures, 562,000tons.   Of this amount 46*6-^ went to the British Empire, thecorresponding quota in terms of value being -i-5e4v$, in both cases representing a gradual decline from previous standard.Correspondingly, there has been a slight recovery in the quotasand amounts going to foreign countries.   The tonmge absorbed by European markets fell off somewhat in 1929 as compared with1928, but there was a very notable advance in the exports toAsiatic countries, which however purchase a product which is relatively much cheaper than the general average value.  On theother hand, it is a comparatively high-pricod article which isexported to European countries.  AB stated before, exports in thepresent year  1930 have been very much diminished, but unfortunately the full particulars as to distribution betweenthe various markets will not beavailable for several months tocome.     Appended will be found a list giving particulars of the moreimportant engineering contracts recently placed with Britishf irms-*.*In addition to these, today*s press (7/ll/30) reports that  Messrs. Dorman,  Long &amp; Co.,  in conjunction with&quot; the German  concern of Demag,  have been successful in securing a contract  for the Steelworks Plant for the now Government establishment  at Pretoria, S.  Africa.    Messrs. Ashmore, Benson, Pease &amp;  Co., and Messrs. Woodall Duckham &amp; Co., have been awarded the  contracts for the Blast Furnaoe and Coking Plants respectively.  Total value of the three contracts is  2,300,000.

LENNOX LEE handed in the following statement:-     The oondition of the cotton trade has shown a slightimprovement during October.     Some fluctuation in raw cotton prices has taken place during the month.  Middling American spot price on September 23rdwas 6.05d. per lb. whilst by October 10th, it had relapsed to5.54d.   This decline reflected the discounting by the marketof an increase in the official orop estimate and little furtherdecline took place when the actual figures became known.Moreover, the price has since risen to 6d. and there is a growingfeeling that prices will now remain steady until demand developssufficiently to warrant an  advance.  The markets for eygptian cotton have been weaker in consequence of the offioial oropestimate forecasting that large crops would have to be dealt with.     Whilst cotton prices were weak a considerable short interest was built up in yarns.  When the advance began it was hastened bycovering purchases and this was particularly noticeable in coarseand medium yarns, and the grey cloth section, due to similarcauses,  has also shown some improvement during the month.
v *J ;&apos;v     Reports froze the finishing side of the industryindicate that there has been a slight increase in the amountof cloth handled by the bleaching section, although theaggregate is considerably below normal and less than theamount for the corresponding month of last year.  Therehas also been an improved off take for certain styleB  inthe piece dyeing, department and a more hopeful feeling is expressed although this has not yet been translated intoincreased supplies of grey cloth to the dyers and thevolume of business remains at about 50 to 65 per cent. ofwhat it was a year ago.  So far as PrintB ar3 concerneda slight improvement has taken place from the downward trendwhich has been apparent for some time, although business hasby no means been brisk.     As regards individual markets India has proved mostdisappointing for all branches of the industry, and particularly the failure, on account of Congress activities, of the dealersin Bombay to resume business and to reopen the bazaars as was reported.  The one market which has been very littleaffected by the Boycott is Madras and business on the whole has been satisfactory.  A fair number of enquiries have beenreceived from Calcutta although prices offered have frequentlybeen too low to be accepted.  Egypt and the Levant have beenpoor buyers and sales have tended to stagnate whilst politicaldisturbances and exchange difficulties have reduced the demand from South and Central America.  China, on the other hand, hasbeen more active, several enquiries having been received forgrey, white and printed cloths, and a number of small orders have been booked.HOSIERY.     MR. WALKER sent the following report:-     It is usual, at this period of the year, for there tobe a seasonal improvement in the Hosiery trade, and speaking generally, reports from all centres are better.   Nottingham.   There is generally a better tone prevailing inthe Hosiery Industry, and the cheaper lines of Winter Underwearare selling more freely.  Stocks, so far as can be ascertained,are not heavy with either Wholesaler or Retailer, both of who mare only operating in a rather hand to mouth manner, relying on the manufacturer to supply their requirements at very short notice.     As regards the Cashmere Hose and Half-Hose sections of theindustry, these are shewing an improved demand, although thereis not the vigour and life in the business that one expects atthis time of the year, whilst the Pine Gauge Artificial Silkand Pull Fashioned Silk Hose sections are holding their own.    &quot;The Export Trade continues quiet, and as regards Canada,this market is praotically closed for the time being owing, tothe operation of the new Tariff,
9 r: ^&quot;J  O      In the  raw material market, Cotton has advanced in price and It is possible that  this may mean that a turn in the  tide of  low prices has  commenced. Leicester.   Most Underwear  manufacturers report a very definite improvement and in some factories up to 95% of full capacity is being worked.      This  improvement, whilst gratifying, is probably due  to low stocks in the hands of merchants and retailers, and  once  these stocks are replenished it is doubtful whether the  demand will continue.      Hosiery manufacturers  generally complain of the effect of imported  goods and there is little likelihood of full employment during the coming Winter. Mansfield.  The state of trade in this district is, if anythingj rather better, the colder weather having slightly improved the demand for heavier goods.  The Fashioned Pure Silk trade is quite good,. at lower prioes, but the Fancy trade is  falling off.Hinokley,   report a slight improvement, chiefly due to the  demand for outerwear*   These are in the main, emergency  orders placed for immediate business.            There is s-une slight improvement in the.number of unemployed, but generally there is no great change in the state of trade.Loughborough, and district.   The state of trade here isbad, worse than a month ago and definitely worse than ayear ago,  Short time is being worked in all branches,  the chief reason given for the bad trade being the continuedheavy importation of foreign goods.                      BOOTS AND SHOES.      MR. BOSTOCK sent the following report:-      In Northampton, while the aggregate output is maintained at reoent levels, business is patchy, some manufacturers having as much on hand as they can conveniently handle, while others are less happily placed.  The firms which manufacture for their own retail shops are better off than many, although makers of high-quality shoes for women have nothing to complain about.  Apart from what may be described as the direct selling houses, manufacturers have to rely, In the main, on orders for filling up stocks.  Of these the flow is steady, and the demands coming to hand appear to afford strong evidence that many distributors are working on small margins, not, perhaps, a surprising circumstance when regard is paid to the reduction in purchasing power which the general depression in trade has caused.      In the other boot centres of Northamptonshire factories, are, perhaps, running on more even lines, as work appears to be spread over a larger number of houses.  In one or two places overtime has been necessary, and there seems to be every reason for anticipating a good run of winter trade.
9 T.;&apos; A,O KJ ix     We are informed that in Leicester a definite improvementin both the manufacturing and faotoring sections of the shoetrade has taken place since the middle of October, and that theffiraafcmajority of firms have participated - though, of course,not all to an equal extent - in its benefits.  By comparisonwith the conditions whioh  prevailed in July and August,manufacturers are now having a froaring time, but, of course,it would not be fair to take those two months as a generalstandard.  It is believed that production is now fully normal,and there is no reason why the upward movement should not continue.     While some of the Stafford factories v/ere on short time a few weeks ago, business at the moment continues fairlysteady at most of the factories, but there has been no general improvement in employment.     A satisfactory feature of trade is that the demand forthe best classes of women&apos;s footwear continues good, blackkid in mat tones being popular, and brown kid in lesser degree.Patent seems to have receded for a time in favor, but the call for reptile skins is still as great as ever.     The National Conference met on Monday, October 20, andis now discussing the question of wages.  The facts are tobe considered by a  special Sub-Committee, and the conference is to meet again in January, when it is anticipated that asettlement will be reached.CQ-OPERATIVE TRADE,MR.

DISTRIBUTING TRADES,     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE sent the following report:-     Only 70 Stores have so far made returns for theirOctober trade, and their results may not be completelyrepresentative.  It seems clear, however, that the Octoberfigures are not going to make as good a showing as thosewhich were published for September.  It is possible thismonth to make more accurate comparisons as there were thesame number of working days this year as in October 1929,Taking the results of these 70 Stores3 total sales forGreat Britain are down by just over 5% as compared withthe corresponding month last year.  V/ith the exceptionof men&apos;s wear, where sales show no variation, all theother departments report minor decreases in turnover.  Thefashion departments show a very small reduction, butfurniture and soft furnishings continue to be the worstfeatures.  Trade in these departments has been exceptionallydifficult all the year,, and still shows no signs of reaching last year&apos;s figures.     So far as the geographical divisions are concerned,the South of England again reports the best results, witha reduction as compared with last year of just over 2%.Stocks (at cost) on the other hand; for Great Britain asa wholes are almost 6% lower than last year, and this maybe regarded as a healthy feature9 the reduction beinggreater than in the two previous months.     Speaking broadly, it seems clear that trade isin a very sensitive condition and responds more rapidly than usual, to favourable or adverse influences.  the weather in most parts of the country has been unusuallymild, and several Stores attribute loss of turnover tothis cause.   In agricultural districts the depressionin farming is reacting on retail trade locally;  while ingeneral the policy of restricting purchases to a minimumis still being pursued by the public in spite of the substantial fall that has taken place in retail pricessince last year.  The colder weather at the end of themonth, however, brought some slight improvement,,BANKING,     MR. GOOD-ENOUGH sent the following report:-     Very easy conditions continued to characterise the short loan market during October, but in the first week ofNovember, a firmer tendency v/as in evidence and on November5th as much as 3 per cent, was paid for day-to-dayaccommodation.  Most of the gold available in the open market each week has been taken for Prance and withdrawals,from the Bank of England for shipment to that country havealso been reported.  Moreover, it is understood that further substantial amounts of gold may be dispatched to paris in the near future, the present efflux beingattributable to the withdrawal of French balances from london as a result of the recent banking troubles inFrance.   On balance, however, the gold holdings of the
Bank of England have &quot;been increased, mainly owing to heavy arrivals of sovereigns from Australia,  as v/ell as,on a smaller scale, from South Africa and the Bank ofEngland Return on November 5th showed that the ^old in theIssueDepartment amounted to 5160.4 millions, against 157.0 millions on October 8th and  131.3 millions onNovember 6th, 1929.   On these dates, the ratio of theReserve to liabilities in the Banking department was59.4, 52.0 and 30.8 per cent, respectively.   The Bank ofEngland, therefore, is in a strong position to meet anydemands which may be made .upon it.     The discount market has been quiet and during Octoberrates became easier, the quotation for three months&apos;fine Bank bills on October 31st being 2.1/16, comparedwith 2&amp; on October 7th.   In the early part of November,however, a firmer tendency was in evidence and the ratehas now risen to 2.3/16, partly owing to the goldwithdrawals on French account.     Business in the foreign exchange market has beenstimulated, partly owing to the uneasiness arising from thepolitical situation in Germany and partly to the outflow of funds from the United States, following a furtherliquidation of security holdings in New York.  Seasonalinfluences, however, have caused a weakening of the sterling-dollar exchange and, in fact, compared with theposition on October 7th, the quotations for several ofthe leading currencies have moved against sterling, the franc, in particular, appreciating to around 123.58against 123.84 a month ago.     The outstanding feature on the Stock Exchangehas been the strength of the gilt-edged market and recordhigh quotations have been established for a number ofBritish Government securities.   Australian stocks havebeen adversely affected by the political developments in that country.  In the Home Railway section several of the junior stocks and prior charges have appreciated.  TheIndustrial market has been quiet.     Judging from the banking figures, there are no signsof an immediate improvement in the industrial position andthe weekly average figures for October of the &quot;Big Five&quot;Banks show a further contraction in the amount of &quot;advances to Customers&quot;.

f* C south AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE handed in the following report:-     The Provisional Government has met with ver? general approval, both in Argentina itself and on the part of foreign interests.   Shortly after its inauguration, a short-term loanwas offered to the Government by the local foreign and nativebanking institutions for a total sum of 100,000,000 pesos (paper)for a term of six months at 5% per annum, whilst, in addition^a short-dated foreign loan of U.S. $50,000,000 has been arranged in New York for a term of twelve months at 5$.   The proceeds ofthis latter issue will be utilised to liquidate a loan which felldue for a similar amount on 1st October, on which the rate ofinterest was 6.03$.   further, the new Government has undertaken to effect all possible measures to improve fundamental economicconditions.   Economies have already been instituted in thenational finances, and an appreciable improvement appears to havetaken place in certain directions in the labour situation.     The Argentine agricultural situation continues to be generally satisfactory.   The wheat, linseed and oats crops are inexcellent condition, although there are more or loss vaguereports regarding the appearance of rust in the wheat in certain districts.   These reports are as yet unconfirmed, and have had little effect upon market conditions, which, so far as Isurope isconcerned, continue to be dominated by offerings of the Russiangrades of wheat at very low prices.   Ploughing and sowing for thenext harvest of maize have been completed in the northern areas and are proceeding actively elsewhere.   The pastoral conditionsare generally Improved.     Returns of Argentine foreign trade issued by the ITationalBureau of Statistics show that exports from the Republic,exclusive of gold movements, during the period January-August,1930, amounted in value to 438,902,313 pesos (gold), as comparedwith 698,845,030 pesos in the corresponding period of 1929, adecrease of 259,942,717 pesos.   The aggregate weight of exports in the first eight months of 1930 was 7,161,378 tons, areduction of 5,145,131 tons.   Complete provisional returns arealso available of the overseas trade of the Republic during thefirst three months of 1930, the total value of imports being given at 201,249,979 pesos (gold;, against 215,345,176 pesos in thecorresponding period of 1929, whilst exports totalled 139,936,846pesos (gold), against 280,382,919 pesos.   Anticipations are thusconfirmed that there would be established an unfavourable balanceof merchandise trade this year, that for the first three monthsbeing, as indicated above, 11,263,133 pesos (gold), as comparedwith a surplus of exports last year of 65,036,743 pesos.   Thisreversal of the trade balance undoubtedly represents the chiefcause of the low exchange value of the Argentine peso, which is currently quoted at around 38^d, against the parity of 47.58d.     Since my last advices to the Council, the general situationin Brazil has become clarified and much anxiety among thosehaving interests in the country has been relieved.   At the timeof the outbreak of the revolution in the Republic, it was feared that the results of the political disturbances might not be decisive, but, in fact, the revolution having ended by a coupd&apos;etat in the federal capital, has proved similar in character to
CJj  ?^k,f  -the political changes which have occurred in recent months inPeru, 3olivia, and Argentina.   Sr. Getulio Vargas, the governor of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, has been installed in office as President, whilst the Provisional Government has issued aDecree revoking the National Holiday and replacing it by a moratorium for a period of thirty days in respect of obligationsmaturing between 3rd October and 30th November.   Bank withdrawalshave been permitted under the terms of the Decree to the extentof 33$ per fortnight.   The purchase of export bills continues tobe confined to the Banco do Brasil,     The revolution having continued over a period of threeweeks, naturally had an adverse affect on the already depressedcommercial situation, but it is to be noted that all the brazilian ports are now again open for the normal movement ofshipping.     On the basis of a recent survey of the coffee areas in theState of Sao Paulo, the Coffee Institute there has estimated the exportable surplus of the 1930-31 crop at 7,500,000 bags.   the exportable surplus of the 1931-32 crop for the whole of Brazil isat present not expected to exceed 14,000,000 bags, owing toabandonment of old plantations, prohibition of the export of low-grade coffee, and other factors.     In general, the commercial situation in Chile shows no appreciable sign of improvement, and in certain directions stocksof merchandise appear more than sufficient to meet immediatere qui r ement s.     In the nitrate of soda industry, stocks are still heavy and production has been curtailed at the oficinas where production costs are comparatively high.   The final arrangements are nowin train whereby practically all the Chilean nitrate undertakingswill be centralised into one national nitrate company, to bear the  title &quot;Compania de Salitre de Chile&quot;.   The formation of a company of this magnitude and importance is naturally a bigundertaking,  especially in view of present money market conditions.   Steady progress, however, is being made with thenecessary financial arrangements, and negotiations in connection therewith are now taking place in New York.   The  exact form which the financial arrangements will finally take is not yet known, but it may be mentioned that, in addition to the nitrateof soda interests, certain representatives of the chilean government are also in New York in connection with the matter.     In regard to the Chilean national finances, the -position has deteriorated  somewhat, Government  revenue having,fallen off asa result of delayed nitrate exports and the general effect on thecountry of the world-wide trade depression.   The Government,however, has  had under consideration various economies amountingto some 90,000,000 pesos.   On the lowest estimate, the OrdinaryRevenue for the current year is placed at 1,151,650,000 pesos,whilst Ordinary Expenditure will probably total 1,152,538,000pesos, there being thus an anticipated small deficit of 888,000pesos.   For  the 1931 fiscal year, a small surplus of revenue isbeing provided for in the estimates, the amount  of which,however,  would be insufficient to provide for the financing of
0 Q Apublic works under the &quot;Extraordinary Budget,  so that presumably the programme of such developments will have to be modified or special means found to meet expend!ture thereon,.      The general trade situation in Peru continues to be extremely dull, but it is satisfactory to observe that appreciable advances have taken, place during tne past month in local prices of cotton and sugar.   Peru, however, has been hard hit by the very much lower values registered for these commodities as&apos; a result of the general fall in&apos; prices throughout the world, and it is to be feared that any appreciable recovery in the economic position of the country must await a considerable broadening of the demand for primary products in the consuming markets.      The Peruvian Government has issued a Decree appointing a special Monetary Reform Commission to report upon the exchange situation and to submit plans for definite stabilisation.   In this connection, it will be recalled that a new Monetary Law was promulgated in Peru in February last, under the terms of which there was established the gold sol as the currency unit of the Republic, the former Peruvian pound being displaced,   Up to  the present time, however, no free gold market has been established in Peru, although the Banco de Reserva del Peru had a total gold holding at home and abroad on 21st August last  of 50*057,028 soles, representing 88.5 per cent, of  the note issue at the same date, one of the highest of such ratios in the world. Reports are current that, to ensure a thorough examination of the monetary situation, the Kammerer Commission may be invited to visit the country and to make recommendations.      The general trade situation in Colombia continues to be dull, although credit conditions are slightly better. Prices of coffee in the local markets are firm, but the continuance of dry weather is adversely affecting crop prospects.   Transport conditions have, been difficult, the level of the River Magdalena being low.      At the request of the Government, the Kemmerer Commission has again visited Colombia and has investigated the general economic position of the country.   The recommendations of the Commission are being submitted  to Congress and include modifications of the Statutes of the Central Bank, to permit of greater elasticity in the credit  situation.      The coffee market in Guatemala has recently been firm and buyers have shown more interest, although prices still remain barely sufficient to leave a margin of profit to the producers.   In Ecuador, the general economic situation is still dull, but the consens\is of opinion appears more optimistic in regard to prospects,   Stocks of merchandise are being reduced, but active trade conditions are not anticipated until after the Christmas cocoa crop begins to come forward. Imports continue to be restricted.   Considerable activity has been in evidence in the local market for Ecuadorian coffee, owing to the firmer prices quoted from the consuming markets.
    Coffee prices in Salvador have shown an upward tendencyand more interest is  displayed there on behalf of Europeanbuyers.  Moreover, the improvement in coffee prices has  had a beneficial effect on the genera.1 situation, and the outlookappears more optimistic.  The trade movement, however, continuesto be slow.     The outlook for the forthcoming coffee crop in Nicaraguahas been adversely affected by the lack of rain which has been experienced since June,.   The situation nay be alleviated ifadequate rain should fall, but otherwise the yield of thenext crop will probably be less than had been anticipated.COLONIAL TRADE.
