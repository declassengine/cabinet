COPY NO.     36CP. 397(30)                        CABINET.                 MANCHESTER AND THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.             Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.     When the Home Secretary and I were in Manchester onNovember 20th, we were asked by Mr. H.W.  Lee,  President  of  the manchester Chamber of Commerce, and Chairman of the JointCommittee of Cotton Trade Organisations,  to meet certainleading India merchants.*     The Home Secretary was obliged to leave for one of  our other meetings before the discussion concluded.     The merchants all put forward in the strongest terms the thesis with which my colleagues are no  doubt familiar.In the first place, they declared that India had not atpresent fiscal autonomy in that no statute .of the british parliament had ever granted it;  this they supported withquotations from the Simon report.   They suggested that  theywould like to discuss this question with the India Office.They then went on to suggest that complete fiscal autonomyshould not be granted by the Round Table Conference,  or  thatfiscal-autonomy should only be given either in return fordefinite fiscal undertakings, or subject  to the maintenanceof certain rights of veto in the interests of United Kingdomt r ad e.*Those present were:-      Mr. Rodier (George Robinson &amp; Sons)      Mr. Behrens (Sir Jacob Behrens &amp;  Sons)      Mr. Silas (Arnhold &amp; Co.,  &amp; Sassoons)      Mr. Demetriadi (Ralli Bros.)      Mr. Rhodes (Sir Jacob Behrens &amp; Sons)      Mr. Campbell (G.&amp; R. Dewhurst &amp; Finlay Campbells)      Mr. Nordlinger (A.&amp; C. Nordlinger)                     and Mr. H.W. Lee (President of the  Manchester Chamber                      of Commerce) Mr. T.D. Barlow (President elect     &quot;        &quot;   ) Mr. E.  Raymond Streat (Secretary,  Manchester  Chamber                      of Commerce).                        7-1-
                                                         0 ,%I o                                                         u t J     They also complained &quot;bitterly of the &quot;boycott  and  of  themethods of Congress to prevent effect being given  to thedesire to buy British textiles which they asserted was stillstrong with many consumers.   They urged the policy of the&quot;strong hand&quot;.   And they suggested that the Bombay mill  owners had a considerable influence over many of the delegates from india and a considerable say in formulating Indian demands.     I did my best in a short reply to explain the impossibility of forcing people by any measures, however  strong,to buy goods which they did not wish to buy, and assured  them of my belief that prospects of revived trade could only lie  inthe restoration of peaceful and friendly conditions between india and the United Kingdom.   I also repeated to them an offer made by Sir Padamji pestonrji Ginwala, one of the Indiandelegates to the Imperial Conference, and an ex-chairman  of theIndian Tariff Board, to come to Manchester to meet themprivately and discuss the situation with them.  This  theywelcomed, but they all urged me to convey to my colleagues,and especially to those who are delegates to the Round table conference, the representations they had made.     I could only promise to do so.   I must add that  I wassurprised at the depth of feeling shown, though it is  no  doubtnot unnatural in the present state of Lancashire trade.                                          W.G.Board of Trade,    25th November, 1930.
