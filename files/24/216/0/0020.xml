CABINET.                       BATTERSEA PQV/ER STATION.                Memorandum by Minister of Transport.         The Cabinet will remember that with my memorandum cp. 295(29) of October 29th, 1929, I submitted a report from aCommittee (consisting of the Government Chemist Sir RobertRobertson, Dr. Lander of the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research, Dr. Bailey of the Ministry of Health andMr.J.A.Macintyre of the Office of Works) which was appointedto advise, in conjunction with the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research, the First Commissioner of Works and electricity Commissioners as to the efficacy of the measures proposed to be adopted by the London Power Company for the elimination of sulphur fumes in connection with the working ofthe Battersea Power Station.   In that report the Committeestated that they had examined an Interim Report from theAdvisors of the Company.   They considered that while the experimental work so far reported indicated that it is possibleto eliminate nearly the whole of the gases present they would prefer before reporting on the practicability of the process,to await the  results approved by a larger experimental plantthen being erected at Grove Road,         I have now received and append to this Memorandum thesecond report of the Power Company&apos;s Advisors together with areport thereon by the Committee presided over by the GovernmentChemist.   That Committee say in their report  &quot;We aresatisfied ...   that the elimination of sulphur gases at theexit in  these experiments was nearly complete, and this was confirmed by  the observations of the chemist from theGovernment Laboratory.
1  DJL &amp; 1.         After commenting on the chemistry of the process  andafter some observations on methods of reducing the cost, theCommittee go on to say &quot;Generally, we may say that the  Companyhas achieved the object of eliminating sulphur gases from  fluegases on a fairly large scale but we think the process  used is capable of improvement in several directions including  cost&quot;a         In order further to satisfy myself on the view of theCommittee as to the efficacy of the results, I asked theCommittee to amplify the report and have now received thefollowing reply:  &quot;The Committee consider that sufficient  worlchas been done at Grove Road to prove that sulphur gases can be eliminated from flue gases entering the air on such a scale as would obtain at Batterseac   We understand that the Companyhopes to simplify and cheapen this part of the process  withoutdiminishing its efficacy.   We agree that this should bepossible, but we cannot say to what extent, without seeing theresults of further experiment.   As regards effluent, weunderstand that settling tanks are being provided at Battersea.This being so, an opportunity is afforded of rendering  theeffluent innocuous&quot;.         I learn from the Chairman of the ElectricityCommissioners that the London Power Company are applying this process to the first section of the Battersea Station now under construction but are considering further improvements designedto reduce cost which are the outcome of the large scaleexperiments referred to in the above-mentioned Reports  and ofthe suggestions made by the Government Committee.         The Electricity Commissioners inform me that theyare satisfied from the reports of the Government Chemists andthe Advisors of the London Power Company that, so far as theEattersea Station is concerned, a practical method has beem
found which will substantially eliminate  sulphur dioxide from theflue gases and they are confident that  no nuisance on this scorewill arise.         As I previously explained to the Cabinet, the LondonPower Company has all the necessary consents  to proceed with thework to which both the Battersea Council  and  the London CountyCouncil have agreed, and in view of the satisfactory nature of theChemists&apos;  reports on the sulphur question I see no reason v/hy thecompletion of the first section of the  Battersea Station should beinterfered with.   ijhould the Company fail  to carry  out theobligations placed upon them by the Electricity Commissioners for preventing the evolution of oxides of sulphur so far as reasonably practicable, the Commissioners would propose  to instituteproceedings to secure compliance with the condition  which  theyhave imposed.         A further question to which I  referred in the memorandumof October 29th, 1929, is that of the extension of the MunicipalStation at Fulham.   I explained that it had been  promised not  to consent to this extension until experimental  work  on a  sufficientscale had satisfied the Government that the problem  of the elimination of  sulphur can be solved.   I also mentioned thatopponents had pressed that no consent to this or  other generating stations  in London should be given until the first section ofBattersea had been working;  but that in view of the fact thatthis delay would make it impossible to provide the necessary electricity  for London on the lines laid down in the Scheme for south East England  it was not felt possible  to agree to it anddeputations  who had raised the question  had been clearly informed of the position.          The Electricity Commissioners now feel that it has becomeurgently  necessary for them  to proceed with  the consideration of the  application made  to  them  by the Fulham Borough Council for the
4 f) 6)i wy                       - ^ -large extension of their generating station.   The Commissionersfeel it will he necessary to hold a public inquiry on thisapplication, and they propose to ask the Fulham Council toissue the necessary Notices so that the Inquiry can be heldin the early Autumn.   I concur in the view of the Commissionersas to the necessity for proceeding at once with the FulhamInquiry, since I understand it is of the utmost importance tothe future of London electricity supply to issue a decisionbefore the end of the year.   This action will, of course, not prejudice in any way the jurisdiction of the First Comivissionerof viorks in the matter.         I wish to recommend that the two annexed reports bepublished without delay so that they can be available forgeneral information as well as for the consideration of thepublic bodies concerned.   I also recommend that with the published reports there should be printed the followingintroductory note to which the Committee presided over by theGovernment Chemist have agreed:-         &quot;In authorising the publication of these Reports theMinister of Transport has ascertained from the Committee preside over by the Government Chemist -    (l)  that the committee are satisfied from the  experiments             made at the Grove Road Station of the London Power             Company that it is practicable to instal, In             connection with the first section of the Battersea             Station, a plant which will reduce the emission of             sulphur fumes to a negligible quantity:    (2)  that the Committee are satisfied that, if such a             plant is installed at Battersea, it will be practicebl             to treat the liyuid effluent so that it may be such             as can be admitted into the River.

The Minister of Health and the First Commissioner ofWorks concur in the foregoing memorandum.                            (Intd).   II oii.1st November, l^O.
       TREATMENT OP SULPHUR FUMES IN CONNECTION WITH       THE WORKING OF THE PROPOSED ELECTRIC POWER       STATION OF THE LONDON POWER&quot; COMPANY AT BATTERSEA.                       SECOND REPORT,         This Report deals with the investigations that have &quot;beencarried out by the London Power Company at the Grove Road power station since the date of the issue by the Ministry of Transportof the White Paper (Cmd.^!^) entitled &quot;Treatment of SulphurFumes in connection with the working of the proposed electric power Station of the London Power Company at Battersea&quot;.         The first series of supplementary experiments wereconducted on the original experimental plant - described in theforegoing White Paper - and were directed to ascertaining thevalue of iron as a catalyst and the degree of sulphur eliminationobtainable with or without iron in the circuit of the gases.Inasmuch as the later experiments on the large scale plant -referred to below - confirmed the results, no further referenceto these supplementary experiments in necessary.         This large scale plant - working in connection withboilers in daily operation - was not erected as a result of the experiments described in the White Paper, but had been designed and constructed independently before the former results were known.   Certain modifications were subsequently introduced.For example, in order to avoid any chance effects due to iron,all iron was excluded from the surface material by coating it with cement.         Experiments were first carried out with the plant coatedin this manner, i.e. with the total elimination of any ironsurface.         Prior to entering the gas-washing plant, the flue gaseswere passed through a grit arrester of the cyclone type.Afterwards, they passed through three horizontal channels
 arranged in parallel, the length of each channel  &quot;being ^  feet by 9 feet 9 inches high by 2 feet 9 inches wide,  (see Figure  I). Subsequently, the gaBes were collected and passed through  a vertical tower 12 feet by J feet 6 inches in cross section and J\ feet high.   This vertical tower contained a filling  of pottery rings, the depth of v/hieh was 4 feet, this material being sprayed with water, whilst the gas in its passage  through the horizontal chambers was also well sprayed with water.          Operating in this manner,&apos;the percentage elimination of sulphur from the gases was about 20 at varying boiler loads,  the&apos; quantities of water used ranging from 12 to ti-0 tons per  ton of coal burnt.          To test the effect of iron, the first 11 feet of  each of the horizontal chambers was then filled with corrugated iron sheets spaced one inch apart and extending from the floor  to  the ceiling.   Sprays were arranged in the ceiling so as to  deliver water over the surface of the sheets.          When using iron sheets, the remaining part of the horizontal chambers was sprayed with v/ater as in the previously mentioned case, and the pottery rings in the tower were  flushed with water as before.          The results of the experiments carried out in this manner are given in the following Table.   From these it will be seen  that with full boiler load the elimination increased to 44 per cent, (instead of 20 per cent, without iron), and that when the boiler was working on half load an elimination  of 67 per cent, was obtained.          It v/ill also be seen from the table that when  the boiler was operated at half load and a solution of carbonate  of soda was circulated through the vertical tower, an elimination of 97 per cent, was obtained.
4 c\ try         It may be further mentioned that when the boiler wasoperating at about one third load, the elimination of sulphurreached a figure of 75 Per cent, without the use of anythingexcept water in the vertical tower.         We feel convinced that with an ample capacity in the gas-washing plant - as will be the case at Battersea (seeFigure 2) - affording thus a sufficient time of contact, and withiron as a catalyst, the elimination of sulphur from the gases,without any use of soda or other alkali, should reach 80 to85 per cento at least.   Ve think therefore that relatively little alkali will be required in actual practice to complete thetotal elimination of the sulphur, although provision has beenmade in the design of the Battersea plant for such treatment.         A point of importance concerns the composition of theeffluent.   It will be seen from the figures given in the tablethat there remains in the effluent liquid a certain proportionof sulhpite which it will be necessary to convert into sulphate.Since in the working plant at Battersea it will be necessary tohave settling tanks to remove dust and grit collected in theeffluent,  there will be opportunity for the complete conversionof sulphite to sulphate, and precipitation of the iron ashydrate.         On the question of cost we have received from Dr. Pearce,the Engineer-in-Chief to the London Power Company, Limited, hisestimates of the capital and operating costs incidental to theapplication to the Battersea Power Station of the proposed gaswashing plant and system.         On these estimates we consider the system to he acommercially practicable one in ito application to the BatterseaStation.
         \/e have again to express our indebtedness to theTechnical Staff of the London Power Company, Limited, for theirvaluable co-operation in this further investigation, and inparticular to Mr* Hewson and his colleagues for the admirableanalytical control of the experimental plant0                          (bgd&apos;. )  E.

    REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE PRESIDED OVER BY THE                 QOVERMKENT CHEMIST.                                      Government Laboratory,                                        Clement&apos;s Inn Passage,                                            Strand,                                              W.C.2.                                       22nd July, 1920.Sir,         We have now read the Second Report of the advisers to the London Power  Company.   In addition, a representative ofthe Government Laboratory on 8th April, 19JJ0, visited the GroveRoad installation while an experiment was in progress and made some chemical determinations.   Further, on yOfh June, lJJO,  wevisited the plant at Grove Road and had a discussion on theSecond Report with Dr. Pearce, his Advisers ani staff.         We are satisfied in the first place that the elimination of sulphur gases at the exit in these experiments was nearlycomplete, and this was confirmed by the observations of thechemist from the Government Laboratory mentioned above, who atthe same time found that about half the burden of removal wasborne by the sodium carbonate wash.   The protecting lining wasnot contributing to the neutralisation of acid, and was in faircondition, a matter of less moment now when we are informed thatacid proof bricks are to be used at Battersea.   We were informedthat the excessive cost of soda ash for neutralising residualsulphur gases will not be incurred, as it is proposed to usemilk of lime which is considerably cheaper, and that the sludgeOf dust, lime salts including calcium sulphite and iron oxideswould be removed from settling tanks and not discharged intothe Thames.          We note that it is now recognised that the conversionto sulphate obtained in the First Report was due to thecatalytic action of iron, but we are not clear that any markedadvance in the process as such bad been made beyond the results
11?X zJ     reported there,   In the present experiments the degree of     catalytic conversion of sulphurous to sulphuric acid is     comparatively small, the elimination of the sulphur acids being     mostly by solution or neutralisation by alkali.              Generally, we may say that the Company has achieved     the object of eliminating sulphur gases from the flue gases on     a fairly large scale, but we think the process used is capable     of improvement in several directions, including cost.              We  should be glad to see the results of any further     experiments,, especially any dealing with  the oxidation of     sulphite to  sulphate before effluent containing it goes into     the Thames,  whether sodium carbonate be used or, as is indicated     in the Report, and as we were definitely  informed, the use of a     cheaper alkali is contemplated.   The nature of the effluent     which may be discharged is a matter for the port of London     Authority.               We recommend that the Ministry  be given  access to     the records  of the chemist supervising the working of the     plant.                                 We are, Sir,                                   Your obedient Servants,                            (Signed) Robert Robertson.   Chairman.                                    C.H.
