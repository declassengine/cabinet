THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1930.SECRET.   &apos;-&quot;dl oJ lni.fi&apos;                                      Copy  No.  J$.8O.P. 385 (30).                                 CABINET.SUGGESTED  TARIFF  CONFERENCE  BETWEEN  CANADA  AND THE                              WEST  INDIES.       MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.    IT will be remembered that in CP. 302  (30) I submitted to my colleagues astatement of the possible issues involved in the projected Tariff Conference between canada and the West Indies.  After that Memorandum had been considered, onthe 19th September, I was approached by Mr. Stevens, Canadian Minister of Tradeand Commerce.  The outcome was that the West India Committee asked for an interview with Mr.  Stevens,  and at it a discussion took place, in  the course ofwhich (as I am informed) he expressed the willingness of the Canadian Governmentto take part in a Conference at any date after  the middle of  January 1931.  It was explained tentatively to Mr. Stevens that an increased preference on sugar imported into Canada would not necessarily benefit the West Indies,  and might even resultin a direct  loss to them, if it  were to be enjoyed  by other parts of the Empire, andthat, in consequence, a proposal might be put forward that  the  Canadian Govern-ment should give a discriminating preference  to West  Indian sugar.  Mr.  Stevensdid not veto this  proposal, but he pointed out  that there  were serious practicaldifficulties  involved, especially  as regards Canadian trade  relations with SouthAfrica.    As  a result of this  meeting, and in deference to  a wish expressed by  therepresentatives of  the West India Committee, I  now propose to  ascertain from thoindividual   Governments  concerned,  their   views as   to  the  desirability ofendeavouring  to arrange  a Conference.  At  the same time, it is proposed  that enquiries should be made  as to  the matters which the Colonial Governments would wish to  submit to  such a Conference,  and the  most convenient time at which itshould be held.  On the receipt  of their replies, the desirability of sanctioning sucha Conference  can  be considered.    In all probability such a  Conference will be desired by most of the West IndianColonies, but  I am sceptical  as  to its  value to their sugar industry.  It will be amatter of difficulty to extract any advantages for them  from Canada at the presenttime, though the prospect is improved by the overtures made recently by australia to the West Indies.  Moreover,  the negotiations  will not be free from the normaldifficulties of tariff agreement and the usual opportunities for friction.  Again, it ispossible  that  the  only outcome of a  Conference might be a set-back  for  theCanada-West  Indies trade.   An extended  preference  for sugar,  or even  freeimportation,  would not  benefit the West Indian  Sugar industry  owing  to  thegreater  capacity of the other parts of the Empire  to take advantage of it, and itwould be difficult  for them to  secure any advantage under a quota system.  TheWest Indies might, indeed, increase preference on Canadian imports in return for avalueless concession by Canada.  There appears, nevertheless, to be  no doubt thatthe West Indian  Colonies would Avelcome  a Conference if there should be any indication of a desire on the  part of the Canadian Government  for one to  be held.    The real crux of the matter is the  possibility of obtaining for the West Indiansugar producers from the Canadian refiners a larger share of the tariff preferencegiven by Canada.   This is  not  a matter  about which Governments can  wellnegotiate, but it could probably be settled without much  difficulty by unofficial      [22039]
representatives concurrently with official negotiations.  -I do not see any insuperable difficulty in disposing of this matter one way or another, once it has been decidedthat negotiations shall be opened.     In my memorandum of the  loth  September  I  pointed out that,  in certaincircumstances,  the suggestion might be made that  the West Indies should give to canada certain tariff concessions, which would not be extended to this country or toother parts of the Empire.  It is, I think, unlikely that the proposal would be made,but, for the reasons  given in that memorandum, I am satisfied that. it--would beimpossible to prevent this being done  if both Canada and the West Indies were anxious  to conclude an arrangement on that basis.   At the same time, by far thebest way of preventing it would be  to  reaffirm, when occasion arises,  the policy ofthe previous Government, as enunciated in the Conference of June 1925, viz., that&quot; if the Colonies felt that it  would in any way make it difficult for them to extendan increased preference to the Mother Country  as well as to Canada, the mother country would not  in  that case insist on  the preference being extended to her.&quot;This question  is more fully  examined  in my memorandum of the 15th September(No. 302),  and I will not here repeat the  arguments on either side.   But I would add that, if a Conference takes place, it may be desirable that the United kingdom should be represented at it by a delegate with a watching brief.                                                                          P.Colonial Office, November 19, 1930.
