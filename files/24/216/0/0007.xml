(This Committee -/ill almost  certainly  be                    paralysed up to Easter).       Scottish Standing Committee.            Small Landholders (Scotland);                  November 18th to  Christmas  Adjournment. 5.  Special note on Unemployment Insurance Bill.      The estimate of  time required for the Unemployment Insurance Bill is considered adequate for a  bill to extend^borrowing powers.   Any  bill in wider terms would necessarily take a  great  deal more  time.    It  is understood that  the question of the  scope of  the bill  to be  taken before  Christmas will be  considered by the Cabinet  on V7ednesday, the 22nd. In this  connection account  will  no doubt  be  taken  of  the report  of  the  Public Accounts  Committee published  last night in which the  Committee  recommend that appropriate  legislation legalising  expenditure  of the Ministry of Labour on various schemes  outside  the present  powers  of the Ministry  should be introduced  forthwith.    It  is understood  that  the P.A.C. renort is under consideration  by the Icinistry of Labour and the Treasury.                     (Sgd.)      THOMAS KENNEDY. 12. Downing Street, S.W.1.   October 21st,  1930.
