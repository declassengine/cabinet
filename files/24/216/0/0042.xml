WITH               m]EUPLOYMEllToLCEMORANPUM BY THE PRIME MINISTER.     As my colleagues will be aware,  it has been  thepractice since we took  office, to present  to Parliament  atroughly 6 months intervals, fa statement of the progress made in regard to public works of development approved for Government financial assistance.  Two  such statementshave been issued and the time has now come for the pre-Sentation of a third.     I have the feeling that something more is required on this occasion than a statement confined to our activities in the fj eld of public works.  No ono would wish  to minimise the importance of this branch of  our labours, bothin affording some immediate relief for the unemployed and in furthering the economic development of the country;but there is, I feel, a real danger that attention maybe focussed on the promotion of public works to the exclusion of all else and that the impression may obtainamong the less well instructed - Hansard is after all, readby comparatively few, that we, as a Government, areconcentrating our efforts on the provision of immediate and temporary palliatives and are taking no steps to effect any permanent cure by attacking, within the limitsprescribed by the existing Palriamentary situation, the  rootcauses of our industrial troubles,
     I accordingly gave  instructions that  the  statement on public works should be  supplemented by  a brief reviewof the principal measures  taken and the policy pursued inother fields in connection with unemployment.  Such astatement has been prepared and a proof is attached,  Ishould like to know whether the idea of publishing sucha paper at this juncture commends itself to my colleagues and to be advised of any comments they may wish to make on its form.

INTRODUCTION.iv.(Part Tof-this statement is in continuation of previous statement-presented to Parliament in December, 1929 (cmd. 3449) and March.&apos;1930  (Cmd.&apos;3519)/and brings up to date figures, given in thosestatements,&apos;1 !of-approvals for Government assistance  under  theDevelopment  (Loan ; Guarantees  and  Gi-ants)  Act,  1929,  theColonial Development Act, 1929, from the Eoad Fund, and under other arrangements, for, works of important employment value.  It must be borne in mind that  the promotion of emergency work;of development is only one  part of the Governments programme^for dealing with unemployment and, in order that this part may be viewed, in proper perspective, opportunity has been taken to surveybriefly (Part II) other  branches  of activity to which the Govern-ment attach  importance in this connection.                            PART I. Emergency Works approved for Government Financial Assistance, .  In&apos; June! and July  last the  Government held a  series  of con-! ferences with representatives of local authorities with the object of securing a considerable extension of the programme of useful public works.which could be put.in hand in order to mitigate the effects oi the prolonged unemployment from which the  country is suffering. As a result of these conferences, at which  special stress was laid on providing  as much  work as  possible for  the coming  winter, substantial concessions were made to local authorities in regard tothe conditions under which Government  assistance would be made available for  local  schemes.   Arrangements  for expediting the preparation,  approval and execution of  schemes were discussed and  agreed.   The  Government  decided also  to  increase very  largely  the Trunk  Road  programme  and  to  facilitate the  execution of theTive-Year  programme for  the improvement  of  classified roads and bridges&quot;  (and the construction of  new roads and bridges likely tobe classified).  In  addition a Vote of ^500,000 was taken to provide for grants to meet the cost of works in necessitous areas.  These grants are intended for areas which are least able to incur capital expenditurechargeable , on: their own  resources and  are in  consequence pre-vented  from  availing  themselves  of  the  ordinary  measures ofassistance from the Unemployment Grants Committee, areas wherethe  rates  have been  heavy for  some  years, where severe  and prolonged unemployment has prevailed and where the local authori-ties have &quot;Been unable to provide  necessary  works. - !At the close&apos;of last Session the principle of  expediting the grant of pow&apos;ets;&apos; needed&apos; in  connection with works  designed to relieve unemployment&apos;was greatly extended by  the passing of the Public Works  ;,Pacilitifeis;; Act.  1  That  Act  provides  an  alternative  to
ordinary Private Bill legislation which will very-materially shorten the  process of obtaining statutory powers in such cases by localauthorities and public utility undertakings.  The Act also makesavailable a greatly simplified and  more  expeditious procedure forthe  compulsory acquisition of land.and easements.   .  Development  (Loan&quot;Guarantees arid Grants) Act, 1929.  The following Table shows the  schemes  approved for grant onthe  recommendation of  the  Advisory. Committee appointed  underPart I of  the Act up  to 30th September, 1930 (including those contained in cmd. 3449 and Cmd. 3519) : &apos; TABLE I.Nature of Undor-takings receiving Assistance. 1.

              Colonial Development Act, 1929.  Section II of Cmd, 3519  outlined progress  under the colonial development  Act  until  28th February, .1930,  by  which  dateschemes involving a total estimated expenditure of  5,650,000 from home and&apos; Colonial fundsdiad been approved under the Act.  .  Up to 30th September, 1930, further assistance  had  been  recom-mended  by the  Colonial Development  Advisory Committee  inrespect of development  works in  Kenya,  Tanganyika  Territory,Northern1 Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Somaliland, Gold Coast, Nigeria,the  West  Indies, Cyprus, Mauritius, Seychelles, North Borneo,     British Honduras,  Western  Pacific,  Palestine  and  Trans-Jordania, Falkland Islands, St. Helena,  Bechuanaland and  Swazi-iaiid.  The total  estimated cost of the schemes recommended forassistance  by  the Committee from its inception  until  30th  Sep-tetuber,  1930, and approved by the Treasury, was  8,374,697.   Of(his total   4,122,440  represented  the cost of schemes in EastAfrica,  which will be  met by the Governments of-  the  territories concerned from loans raised  under the Palestine  and  East AfricaLoans  Act,  1926, as  amended  by  the  Colonial  development act,  1929.  Of  the  total  of  8,375,000  it  is estimated  thatsome .- 3,300,000  will be  spent in  Great Britain., In addition tothe schemes covered by this  figure of   8,375,000, further schemes under the Palestine and East Africa Loans  Act have been inaugu-rated,  the estimated cost being some  4,820,000.                         Road Fund.  Under the Trunk Road Programme  (the total of which was raised in July last to  21,000,000) the  schemes approved amountedat 30th September, 1930, to over  15,000,000, of which schemesrepresenting expenditure  of  over   5,000,000  had been definitelyapproved for grant and the  balance approved in principle.  Themajority of the   schemes approved  will  cost individually  over 100,000 each, including  33  schemes  of widening and reconstrue-tion and 12 important  by-pass schemes.  Under the Five-Year Programme of  27,500,000, the schemes approved amounted at 30th September, 1930, to nearly  25;000,000,of which  schemes representing expenditure of nearly  9,000,000had  been definitely approved for grant and the , balance approved in principle.  Nearly half the schemes approved will cost individu-ally  over   100,000 each, including 20 schemes of  widening-and reconstruction l;ahd;-30 new  sections ;of  road Of  which&quot; 7; are important by-pass roads.                      ^ &quot;      &apos;,    I-..&quot;  It is estimated that the Road Fund liability in respect  of  thewhole  of the. schemes -already .approved will be  approximately 30,000,000.    &apos;      &apos;         &apos;  -  &apos;   !.....    :--/?
  In  addition to  the  above,  the  Annual Programme  deals withschemes of improvement of classified roads and bridges of lessermagnitude.  The  Annual Programme schemes approved for grantunder the. present Government (i.e.,  since 30th  August 1929)amounted at 30th September to  9,000,000.  It is  estimated thatthe Eoad  Fund  liability  in respect of  these  schemes  will  Lapproximately  5,000,000.  As  explained in Parliamentary, Paper  Cmd. 3449, the Five-Yearand   Annual  programmes  absorb  the  previous  programme  for1929-30.  In  addition to the above, grants have been made by the Unem-ployment Grants  Committee  (as shown in  Table  lit  on  PAO-e 4)in respect  of expenditure  estimated  at  about  6,000,000  in^con-nexion with unclassified roads and  bridges.                &apos;.       Other  Programmes..  In  Cmd. 3519  particulars  were given of other  arrangements under which works would be undertaken by or with the assistanceof departments  whose  functions are such as to &quot;enable them tomake  some contribution towards the  alleviation of unemployment.The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries had up to the 30th Sep-tember  agreed to  assist 175 land drainage schemes, submitted byland drainage authorities, which are estimated to cost  2-36,000 inaddition to the schemes referred to in Table III above.*  The samedepartment had  agreed to assist  459  schemes  of field drainageestimated to cost  48,000, and 133  schemes for the supply of waterto agricultural holdings at an estimated cost of  93,000.  The Development Commission have  power to assist  agricultureand rural industries,  the construction and improvement of fisheryharbours, and  land drainage and  reclamation,  and between thedate  when the present  Government assumed office  and the 30thSeptember,  1930, the  total  estimated  cost of  the  schemes inrespect  of which the  Development Commission  had agreed torender financial  assistance was  807,000.  These schemes are quiteseparate from those dealt with, by other Governmental authorities.  Reference  was  made  in Cmd. 3519  to  the programme of work at a cost of some  60,000,being carried out over the winter 1929-30by the Office of Works.  This programme has now been completed,but during the present winter works suitable for the employmentof unskilled labour on Ancient Monuments and Historic buildings and in  the Royal Parks will be carried out by the same depart-ment at a cost of   129,000.  The accelerated programme of  trunk telephone construction bythe General Post Office, at  an estimated cost  of   1,500,000, to  * The land drainage schemes where the work is to be financed by the localauthority out of  a loan are  dealt with by  the Unemployment GrantsCommittee.
 /hioli reference  was made in Cmd. 3519,. is  being, actively carried ut in addition to the main construction programme  of  a capital       1.0,500,000.  As is explained in the  prefatory note, a special isum ,of   500 iQOQhas been made available  for the promotion  of&apos; works sin - speciallynecessitous areas,  .- 440,000 being allocated  to ; works  in -Englandand  Wales  and   60,000 to  works  in&apos;  Scotland.   Schemes^ ,inEngland  and Wales to a total value of  410,000 have already beenapproved by the Ministry of Health.  for the purposes  of land  settlement in Scotland the  grant inai,l to the Agriculture (Scotland) Eund was  increased  in  the vote for the financial year 1930-31  from  115,000 (the  amount  voted in 19-29-30) to  175,000.   E arm and field drainage schemes costingsome  100,000 and involving assistance from the Exchequer to theextent of ; 30,000  have been approved  by the Department of Agri-culture for Scotland, and the Land Drainage (Scotland) Act, 1930,under which main drainage works costing some  100,000 will be proceeded with over a period of 5 years, is now in operation. -,.Im-provement schemes to Scottish fishery harbours at a; cost of  about 1.0,000,  have been approved for assistance from the  funds of the fishery Board for  Scotland. The expansion of  the programme of the  Forestry  commission has already been described in Gmd. 3519.                         Summary.  The  value  of  schemes  under various programmes  which: havebeen approved up  to September 30th, may -be:  summarised-:.asfollows :    Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act,     1929, Part I     ................ .  28,447;230   Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act,     1929, Part II    ............         &apos;46,766i69o   Colonial Development Act,  1929......   ....    8,375;000   Boad Fund  .........     ......  -  ...   49,000,000   Miscellaneous      .........:             - 3-840,323Totai ... 135;928;24B  On the basis commonly accepted that  1,000,000 provides workfor one year for 4,000 men, these schemes will provide Work&apos;;to theextent of more than 500,000 man years.&quot;
                           PART II.                 Industrial  Reorganisation, etc.  Although as will  be seen from the foregoing tables, the policy of promoting  public works in relief of unemployment has been vi^or-pusly&apos;pursued,  it must&apos;be recognised  that&apos;such  a policy is subjectto certain general limitations.   the acceleration of programmes ofwork by local authorities and many public  utility  undertakinglias  been  in  progress  for  the last   ten  years, and during thatperiod the  economic  equipment of the country its roads, bridges,docks, railways and the like has been greatly improved.  But ina country already very  highly developed, the process of anticipatingfuture needs cannot  in the nature of things continue indefinitely.The arrears of work  which had accumulated during  the war years have been  overtaken,  and  there are signs  that  the visible pro-grammes of public works which can conform  to any reasonabletest of economic  justification, now embrace, to a large extent what can usefully be done  in the near future.  The promotion of  public  works is  avowedly only a temporaryemergency measure.   Side by side with this, the  Government  arepursuing a long  range policy of development.                    Industrial Reorganisation. . As was  stated in Cmd. 3519, referred  to above, it is to the iu-creased  provision of  ordinary industrial employment through  the revival of   our  trade  and  industry  that the  Government attachprimary importance.   Their work in the industrial field  may be grouped under two heads : the encouragement of reorganisation ofindustry at.home and  of trade  abroad.  Legislation has  been  passed putting the  coal industry of  thecountry  for the first  time in its history in a position to promote anational sales policy and  organisation  and to deal with internationalproblems on a footing more nearly equal to that of  its competitorsabroad.  Immediately upon taking  office the Government appointed Com-mittees to consider and report  upon the condition and prospects ofthe Cotton and Iron  and Steel Industries,  and  to make reconi-mendations as to any  action that might be taken to improve their position.  The   Reports of  these Committees have now  beenreceived.. &apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;,).\-]&apos;k- -t .,[  .    \        ........., The Report on.the. Cotton Industry (Cmd. 3615), recommendedthat the Government. should ; take every step in their power to urge upon, employers and operatives :in Lancashire the importanceof  considering certain means, of1reducing: the  costs of production with a view fo the, recovery;qflost,trade.  This recommendation is being acted upon, and  the  Government is in close and  constant-
fj tj JW) Consultation with all the interests concerned upon the basis of the Report.  The Report on the Iron and Steel Industry is similarly Ihc subject of discussion with  representatives-of the  industry  and of nuance.  One of the measures  recpmmended in the Report on the Cotton industry is the formation of large units..  Careful.consideration is jbeing given to the question how far similar, measures are required In other industries, and in certain cases measures of reorganisation Ire under discussion.  These matters are of course highly confidential - lial, affecting as they do the position of  individual firms, and cannot be referred to in detail.  Further,  the negotiations  leading up to [reorganisation cover a large number of interests and must of their nature be delicate  and prolonged.  With a view to ensuring that finance will be available for soundIscheuies of reorganisation discussions have taken place with leading financial  interests  and  a new  organisation  has come into being, ikuou a as the Bankers&apos;  Industrial Development Company, with thepupport of the leading banks  and financial  houses, to consider[schemes submitted  by the  basic industries of  this country for the[purpose of their  rationalisation, either  by  industries or by regions.                     Monetary Conditions.  As a stimulus to trade recovery and industrial development lowrates for short term borrowing have an especial importance.   Cheapmoney depends on a  variety of  influences,  many of them worldfactors outside  the control or guidance of any single country; andmany causes have contributed to  the  attainment of the easy creditconditions which now  widely prevail.  But towards their attainmentin this country the Government were able to make a material con-tribution by their handling of the floating debt., In. the autumn of1929, and the early months of  1930,  when it became evident thatthere was a  surplus of long term money available for. investment the  public  were invited to. subscribe  to  issues of 5 per cent,  and4i per cent. Conversion  Stock.   These  new  issues  provided, overand  above the amounts required to meet  maturing debt, a,free sumof about i&apos;160,000,000.  This new money, as it became available in stages, was  used to reduce the need  for public borrowings in  the short term market on Treasury Bills.  The repayment of these bills had  the effect of increasing the market resources available for tradeand  commerce, while  diminishing the demand upOn them for non-trade purposes.  The process was so devised and timed as to hasten the rapid transition frOm high rates:to easy conditions&apos;,:which&apos;wasthe  outstanding monetary&apos; feature during&apos;the1 past&apos; year; -acid  theGovernment  thus contributed materially to  the  fall  in  &quot;TreasuryBill  rates from 6 per cent, to little more&apos;than-2 jper cent:&apos;and  there-establishment  of the  monetary conditions most&apos; likely  to favour a world recovery&quot;of trade,          &apos;J    - &apos;&apos;-&apos;-&apos; &apos;fltxIu --&apos;0k)i: MAIM.;
                          Export Trade.  As  regards export trade, the Government in April of this yearbrought  into being  the Overseas Trade Development  Council atthe instance of, and for the purpose of assisting, the Departmentof Overseas Trade in their study of  present  and potential markets,in .their  investigation  of reasons  for the  decline in.Exports, andin their  search for fields  of  profitable expansion of  British Trade.In co-operation with the industries concerned,  steps have alreadybeen  taken which should  lead  to an expansion of trade overseas.The more  important of these steps  include the  despatch abroad ofTrade Missions.   A Mission has just returned from South Africa.and the Overseas Trade  Development  Council is discussing  withthe leader  and members of the Mission the best means of makingthe work  of the  Mission as effective  as possible.  Another  very important  Mission which includes a specially constituted CottonSub-Mission is at present visiting Japan and  China.  A further activity which is being developed by the Departmentof Overseas Trade is that of arranging for  trade investigations in selected  overseas markets on behalf  of particular industries. Thereis at  present in South America a trade delegation  from  Sheffieldunder the  leadership of the  Master Cutler, the reports of whose work are distinctly encouraging :  an investigation on behalf of theBoot  and  Shoe industry is proceeding in Northern  Europe.   The  Government  have  decided  to  participate in  the BritishEmpire  Trade Exhibition to  be held  in Buenos Aires  in 1931,and their  decision has led  to  co-ordinated efforts by  the Britishmotor, electrical and aircraft industries on  a very large scale.   Complementary to the  work of the Government in helping in-dustry  to  retain old and open new foreign markets,  stands thework  of the Export Credits Guarantee  Department.    provision was made  in the Overseas  Trade Act, 1930, for the  continuanceof the scheme to March 31st, 1935, and the increasing extent towhich recourse has  been had to the facilities  afforded since thepresent  scheme began in 1926  may be gathered from the following figures of  exports assisted :       9  months to 31.3.1927     12  months to&apos;31,3.1928    12  months to 31.3.1929    . 12  months to&apos;&apos;31.3.1930..      6  months to 30^9.1930  365,0002,455,0004,283,0005,661,0005,041,000 17,805,000

Assistance towards the revival of industry  proper, must,  unless the existing social disequilibrium  is  to  become even  more  pro- nouuced, be accompanied by  measures to restore agriculture  in this country to a more prosperous condition.  1 The GovernmenCs[proposals&apos; in respect of  agriculture  are  designed to increase  the uuinber of  persons deriving their  livelihood  from&apos; the  cultivation of the  land and also to increase the  provision of instruction and demonstration  so as to give all occupiers of  agricultural holdings improved facilities for carrying on their business with the maximum efficiency.  The Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill now before the House  of Commons makes provision  for an  experiment in large- scale farming and also for the establishment of new demonstration centres where required.  In addition, arrangements are to be made for reclaiming and reconditioning  land  in  order that  agricultural production and agricultural employment may be extended.  These measures will,  both directly and indirectly,  provide openings for additional  employment.   In the same way,  the proposals  in the Bill for the provision of small holdings,  both for  the unemployed and for other persons capable of cultivating such holdings efficiently, will create additional work by the erection of dwelling houses, farm buildings, provision of water supply and other equipment necessary for the sub-division of existing farms selected as suitable for  con- version into small holdings.  Over and above this, the small holdings themselves, in addition to providing a fuller opportunity for exist- ing farm workers and others, will, it is expected, enable men now unemployed in other industries  to become permanently self-support- ing.  For persons  who are unemployed but,  for one reason  or another, are unable or not suited to become small holders, the Bill makes provision for the extension of allotments.   The Governments proposal  is to  extend  such allotment cultivation  where suitable land can be found in  reasonably close proximity to the homes of persons wholly or partly unemployed.   It is the intention  of the   Government to  develop organised marketing of home  agricultural produce.   For this purpose legis- lation will be introduced to facilitate  the comprehensive organisa- tion of producers for the systematic marketing  of their products. Apart from  legislation,  the Government,  as a  new  departure  in this field, has  already  provided  funds to  enable  standardisation schemes  under  the  National  Mark to be  given  wide publicity. Special provision has also been made to enable the whole  subject of organised  marketing to be  exhaustively studied at home and abroad for  the information  and guidance  of the home&apos; producer.   Closely associated with agriculture is the work of land drainage. The Act of this year provides for the  establishment of new  Drain- age Authorities  throughout  the country  and gives them compre- hensive powers, inter alia, to execute land drainage schemes, many
  The purpose underlying the long range policy of the Government.as described briefly in the foregoing paragraphs, is so to  improve thegeneral economic  condition of the country that full and immediateadvantage may be taken of  any improvement  in  general world trade conditions.   It is only through  an increase in national pro-ductive and.. marketing  efficiency that the  capacity  of industry  to absorb labour will ultimately be increased. -(8188-S2) Wt. 17774-1246 12,12,60  11/30 P.

Since the War a -&apos;lai&apos;ge &apos; programme&apos; - 6i; house- :burlding has been undertaken towards which substantial&apos;aid. has  been afforded fromthe Exchequer.  The Housing Act  which was  passed  last Sessionprovides  not only  for  the  continuance of the assistance availableto local authorities under  the Housing Financial Provisions  Act,1924, and  the  stabilising  of  the present  rate  of assistance until1933, but also  provides special-assistance designed to facilitate andexpedite  the  clearance of  slums and  to  prevent the creation  ofnew  slums. The Act  provides machinery for a  systematic attackon  bad housing conditions and for all necessary rehousing.  With  Ia view to securing continuity  of  action and an  adequate  volume of  !new  Construction, it. requires local authorities to  submit to  the  fMinister of Health during the present year a  programme of the steps they  propose to  take during the ensuing five  years for deal-ing  with housing conditions in their  areas and for  providing newaccommodation ; and a siniilar programme is to be  furnished each  !fifth year.   The Act  also contains special provision  designed to  Isecure the execution  of comprehensive schemes  for  meeting the  !housing  needs  of rural areas.   A  corresponding Act was passed  for Scotland with the object of encouraging a systematic and rapid improvement in the slum con-ditions in that  country.  A;igorous steps are being taken in both countries to  urge localauthorities to  make active use of the new powers  conferred  upon them.
