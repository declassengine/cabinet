document is  the  property  of His  Britannic Majesty^  Government.     I am in general agreement with the memorandum 0.P.376(30)which has been circulated to the Cabinet by the President of theBoard of Trade, but, as the Minister responsible for Northern    .                       -                                      - . [4!Ireland affairs, I think that the communication which the President ]proposes in paragraph 11 of this memorandum to.make to the IrishFree State Government had better at this stage be confined to in-forming that Government that it has been found impossible to pro-oeed with the scheme which has been under discussion and that there;jis no alternative but to oonsider future arrangements on the basisof dividing the lights for purposes of administration and financebetween Northern and Southern Ireland.     In my view, if any details are settled with the Irish FreeState Government before Northern Ireland has been consulted - thatis to say, if Northern Ireland is presented with a scheme whichhas already been agreed on between the British Government and theIrish Free State Government - it is certain that the  NorthernIreland Government will approach such a scheme with a pre-disposition to raise objections, and agreement between the three parties will be certainly more difficult to reach.  If on the other :hand only a very general communication is made at this stage tothe Free State Government, I am prepared at once to consult theNorthern Ireland Government and there will be much greater hope of arriving at an agreed solution.  I understand  that a scheme of allocation of Irish lights has been proposed by the Board of Tradeprofessional officers which,  if accepted, would have the advantage that it would probably be unnecessary to raise again the questionof Irish lights in any settlement that may be reaohed of the thornyquestion of the boundary between Northern Ireland and the IrishFree State in Carlingford Lough and Lough Foyle.JSJJ R E T.,P.37&quot;9(30)CABINET.LIGHTHOUSES IN IRELAND.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.J.R.C.14th Novembor,  1930.
