THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.           DYESTUFFS (IMPORT REGULATION) ACT,  1920.      Memorandum lay the President of the Board of Trade.   1. In accordance with the request of my colleagues I meton the 6th November representatives of the followingorganisations:-The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos;     Associations,The Cotton Spinners&apos;and Manufacturers&apos; Associations,The  ?woollen and Worsted Trades&apos; Federation, andThe Worsted Spinners federation,The United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association,The Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association.   2. The representatives present explained that there had&quot;been no time since receiving the invitation to the conference to consult the members of their respective organisations, &quot;butthey stated definitely that they were satisfied that the officialattitude of opposition to the Dyestuffs Act which thoseorganisations had always taken up is still maintained and hasthe continued support of the great majority of the members.     The existence of a minority in favour of an extension ofthe Act was admitted only in the case of certain of theemployers&apos; organisations.   They were therefore definitelyopposed to any prolongation of the Act.   3. The chief reasons given for this opposition were:-     (a) The effect of the Act as one of the factors tending to keep costs of dyeing at  an unduly high  level,thereby affecting adversely export  trade.    It wasagreed that prices had been declining for  some time past, and were not now for  dyestuffs manufacturedhere appreciably above the  continental level, but itwas urged that the prices of the dyestuffs allowed  SECRET.I.p. 375 (30).Copy No.CABINET.
          to be imported are higher  than they would be if          there were no restriction.     (b)  The -uncertainty and delay caused by the need of          obtaining licences for  colours not made in this          country,  with the result that orders have          sometimes to  be refused.              It was stated by the representatives of both          the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos;          Associations  and of the Association of Cotton          Spinners  and  Manufacturers that though complaints          under both these heads  were less frequent than          formerly, they were still  made.     (c)  The progress made by the industry, as shewn in the          report of the Dyestuffs Industry Development          Committee, and its present position, show that the          purpose of the Act has been achieved, and that being          so, there is  no justification for the continuance of          the Act.     (d)  The burden of  building up the industry has hitherto          fallen upon the colour-using trades;  if for any          reason of State (e.g. defence) it is decided that          further assistance is necessary that assistance          should be a national charge and not one resting          upon a particular group of trades.Board of Trade-    8th November, 1930.
