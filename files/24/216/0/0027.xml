S nOCTIXJETT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                                            39                                                COPY NO._                               CABINET.                          Lighthouses in Ireland.            Memorandum fry the  President of  the  Board of Trade.         1.  I  desire  to bring to  the notice  of my colleagues the      question of  the future arrangements to  be  made in regard to      the administration of Irish Lights.   At present  these lights      are administered by the Commissioners  of Irish Lights, whose      jurisdiction extends to lights both in  the Irish  Free  State and      in Northern  Ireland,  Negotiations have been proceeding for      nany years with both Irish  Governments  in  order to implement      the provision of the Irish  Treaty relating to this subject, and      the time has now come when  a decision  in principle is  required      as to the basis of future negotiations.         2.  The Irish Agreement of 6th December, 1921,  which is      scheduled to the Irish Free State Constitution Act,  1922,      contains in  an Annex the  following provisions:-                &quot;A Convention  shall be made  between the British           Government and the Government of  the  Irish Free State to           give effect to the  following conditions:-                 * % &apos;m    * * *   *v*    q a o   m * *    * * *   oeo    0 m m                (b) that Lighthouses, buoys,  beacons  and any           navigational marks  or navigational aids, shall  be           maintained by the Government of the Irish Free  State  as           at the date hereof,  and shall not be  removed or added to           except by agreement  with the British  Government.&quot;         3. The Treaty, on the face of it, contemplated that the      Free State Government would bear the cost  of the  service of                                      -1-ICRST.7&amp;T3C)
lighthouses in the Free Stato.    It  was  apparently not realisedat the tine that this oost had never been  a Government chargebut was borne by the General Lighthouse  Fund which derives itsincome from light dues levied on shipping  in the ports ofGreat Britain and Ireland as a whole and is under the statutory control of the Board of Trade.    In  these  circumstances  it was thought that the Free State Government might reasonably  contend that it would be unreasonable to expect  them to maintain, fromtheir ordinary revenue, lights which mainly benefit british shipping.   On the other hand,  it was clear that if the  cost ofmaintaining the Fx^ee State lighthouse system were to  continue tobe defrayed out of the General Lighthouse  Fund, the Board ofTrade and the ship-owners should have some voice in thoexpenditure.   I may add that in Northern  Ireland the lighthouseservice is a reserved service under  the  Government of ireland act, 1920.   4. As regards the negotiations prior  to 1929, it is sufficientto say that the possibility was first explored of creatingmachinery under which it would still be  possible to deal withIreland as a whole, and that when a  solution on these linesappeared to be impracticable, the&apos; possibility  was considered of dividing Ireland into two parts for  lighthouse purposes, the lightsin Northern Ireland to be under one  of the General LighthouseAuthorities, i.e., Trinity House or  the  Northern Lighthouse Board,and the lights in the Irish Free State to  be transferred to theIrish Free State Government with a subsidy from the General Light-house Fund.   The seoond plan fell through, largely because adivided Ireland for lighthouse purposes  involved an allocation toone part of Ireland or another of the lighthouses in Lough Foyleand  0,arlingford Lough, the boundary between Northern and southern Ireland never having been determined  so far  as  the waters of these two Loughs are concerned.-2-
  5. Then at tho beginning of 1929, my prodecossor,in conjunction with Mr. Amery, discussed the question with.representatives of the Government of the Irish Free State.Thore emerged from this Conference a suggestion that itmight bo possible to evolve a schema which would dealwith Irish lights as a whole, and so avoid tho difficulties and extra expense involved in a divided service, andrender the boundary difficulty less acute.  It was assumedat that time that the Free State Government had noobjection to an all-Ireland lighthouso authority,constituted on lines similar to those of the presentCommissioners of Irish Lights who  are mainly a body ofprivate individuals.  While the preparation of a. scheme on these lines was proceeding, the subject was mentionedin November 1929 to the Irish Free State delegates attending the Conference on Dominion Legislation, who then saidthat they wore not in favour of a  Board on the analogy of the present Irish Lights Oominis si oners.  They suggestedthat a body of three persons should be constituted to doalwith, all the lights in Ireland, at presont charged againstthe General Lighthouse Fund, this  body to  consist oftwo Irish Free State civil servants  (one of whom,  it was subsequently suggested, would be  the Chairman) and one representative appointed  by the Board of Trade torepresent Northern Ireland interests.    6. A  draft  Convention  was drawn up on  these  lines,under which estimates would be submitted  annually  covering the  lighthouse services in Ireland.  These would beconsidered by  representatives of  the British  and IrishFree  State Governments and of the shipowners, and  whenthey  were  approved, payments  would be ^ade  to the  Irish
Free Stato Government in respect of the operations ofthe new Board in tho Freo Stato, and to the new Boarditself in respect of Northern Ireland, which would boregarded as an area administered by a general lighthousoauthority and controlled by the Board of Trade on theusual financial lines.  It was hoped under this system to reduce the boundary question to a nominal one,involving an allocation of the lights in the two Loughsas bet&quot;/een north and south only for the purpose ofdivided estimates.   Copies of tho draft Convention weregiven to the Irish B&apos;ree State representatives, and to theHome Office, in order that the respective Governments inIreland might be consulted.   7. The Irish Free State Government in July last acceptedthe draft Convention, with suggested elaborations, but theGovernment of northern  Ireland objected in principle toany scheme involving the setting up of an all-IrelandAuthority, and to the lighthouses  in their area being administered by any body in Dublin.  In particular, theyobjected to any Lighthouse Eoard consisting mainly of irish rrec State officials, and stated that in theiropinion the only proper arrangement was for the lights onthe coast of Northern Ireland to continue to be treated asa  reserved service and be controlled, as other reservedservices are, solely by the Government of the United Kingdom.They reiterated their considered view that any proposalinvolving control of  the Northern  Ireland lights  directly or indirectly by a Proe State body would be fraught with the gravest political danger.
      3.   Thus,  :.t  the  moment  this natter is  no  nearer  settlement than it  has  been ever  since the Irish Treaty was  signed, and it is necessary to determine on what lines we shall  proceed.   I may say that the Commissioners of Irish Lights are  very uneasy  in regard to their present position and .have threatened  to resign from time to time.    This makes an early settlement most desirable and in any case some communication to the Irish Free State  must be made shortly.   Their delegation to the Imperial Conference contains some of the Free State officials specially concerned with this question, and it is known that they anticipate  being informed of the present position of H.1I. Government in the  United  Kingdom before their delegation returns to Dublin.      9.   The first question to be deoided is whether the United Kingdom Government can proceed with any kind of All-Ireland scheme, which necessarily involves a * basis of operations in Dublin, in face of the determined opposition of Northern Ireland. As already explained, lighthouses in Northern Ireland are a reserved service.  In law, t-herefcre, the Government of  Northern Ireland  isnot directly concerned with the administration of this  service and the United Kingdom Government have the power to arrive at  an agreement with the Irish Free State Government  on an All-Ireland basis whatever the views of Northern Ireland.     10.  But I would not recommend the adoption of this course. -Northern Ireland might well make administration very difficult  and I am reminded by the Home Office that a question of principle  is involved.  Under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,  there were three categories of services (l) reserved services;   (2)  transferred services;   (3) all-Ireland services, e.g. railways, fisheries,  etc. to be administered by the Council of Ireland.  The Counoil  of Ireland which never actually came into existence was finally abolished as a part of the boundary settlement  of 19 25.  Thus,  any proposal now made to set up an All-Ireland service for lighthouses                            -5-/
                                                                 a u omight he regarded by Northern &quot;Ireland as an attempt to go backupon the settlement of 1925,  and I am told that even itsconstitutional propriety might be challenged.     11.  If, as I suggest, it is: useless to pursue an All-Irelandscheme, we must revert to proposals based on a divided Ireland.If that is agreed, I should propose that the Irish Free StateGovernment be informed that it has not been found possible toproceed with the soheme which has been under discussion and thatthey should be asked to consider future arrangements on the basis of dividing the lights for purposes of administration and financebetween Northern and Southern Ireland.   So far as the lights inLough Foyle and Garlingford Lough are concerned, it would be made clear t&amp; the Irish Free State Government that any arrangement forthe division of the lights in the two Loughs to which they might agree for purposes of lighthouse administration, would be regardedas entirely without prejudice to the eventual  settlement of the boundary question.   It will, of course, be necessary also to informthe Government of Northern Ireland.                                          W.G,Board of Trade,  10th November,  1930.
