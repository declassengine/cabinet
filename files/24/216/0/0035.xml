 a .^l&apos;j VUS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).                                                          Copy NOjjSjC,384(30) .             CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR THE AGRICULTURAL--industry:Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.             I  have  had  an opportunity  of  seeing  a  draft  of the    memorandum by the Minister  of  Labour  (CP.382  (30))  with    regard  to  the motion  on  unemployment  insurance for the    agricultural industry which is to  be  moved by  Lady Noel-Buxton    in the  House of Commons  on  Wednesday  next.             Before  my colleagues come  to  a  decision as to  the    attitude which  the  Minister of Labour should take  in the    debate  I wish to bring to their notice  that  as far as  can    be ascertained,  unemployment insurance  for agricultural    workers  is  the  one  burning  question among such workers in    the cereal  growing  areas in this country.  Wherever  I  go    and get  into touch  with  agricultural  M.Ps. or  agricultural    labourers  I am  told that unemployment insurance  is the  one    thing which would satisfy them and remove the  dread  of loss    of employment which is now  hanging over them owing to  the    serious  depression  among arable farmers.             I hope  that my colleagues will agree that  the  proposed    statement of the Minister of Labour should be  amended  in such    a way as to give more  satisfaction to our supporters in the    agricultural areas, and alleviate to  somo extent the    disappointment which the agricultural workers  feel owing to the    delay which has already taken place in extending to them tho    benefits of unemployment Insurance.                                              C.A.W^Y of Agriculture and Fisheries,RIO,  Whitehall Place,        S.W.I.  14th November, 193Q.
