           Our discussions on the unemployment difficulties which, since taking office, have so heavily beset our path- musts owing to shortness of time, be very limited in scopes  In consequence9 no one of us is able to put his views in anything like a comprehensive manner before his colleagues^,  Because this is the case5 I have put in writing some views which I hope may merit some consideration by the Cabinet and its various subcommittees,.           The multitude of memoranda9 with an ever increasing tide of pessimism which the experts can do nothing to stems leaves me with the impression that the only contribution which they can make towards the palliation of   ) the present situation is to advise that in one way or anothers,  wages must come down;-  the social services - especially unemployment benefit and public assistance - must be severely curtailed;  and a new Geddes axe applied to public expenditures by the State and by Municipal author!tieSo   There is  also a half-hearted sort of proposal to deal in some undefined way with what is commonly described as  the  &quot;Rentier&quot; class - though it is a little difficult to  discover what special treatment is contemplated for making those  with fixed incomes9 derived from War loanf contribute to present day needsQ   I have looked in vain for anything  like the French plan of helping the  National Exchequer by  paying in  full satisfaction home and foreign debts  on  a 2d0  for 10do  basisu   I  should have imagined that when looking  round for  economies  our experts  might have started with  the  wealthy rather  than with the poverty stricken  and  destitute  unemployed  and those  dependent on social  services,)   In passing it  is rather difficult to understand what  is  the  difference  between lowering the standard  of life  of the  masses by  means of tariffs or inflation9  and the  clear cut proposal  to  bring about  the seme result by  lowering wages and unemployment pay9  etcQ          Without  depreciating  in  any way What has alreadybeen done  on behalf of  the  unemployed and for the restoration of British  industry -  on the  contrary  I  appreciate; it very much  -  it  is  necessary  that  we  should recognise what is now almost  universally  admitted9  that though our export  trade  may get brief  spells  of a  very modified prosperity, our position in the markets of the  world cannotbe  recovered,,  There  are many books  on  the  subject9  some reminiscent of Gibbons  &quot;Roman Empire&quot;9  others  likeLudwell Dennys&quot; &quot;America  conquers Britain&quot; and Leacock&quot;s &quot;Economic prospe pity  of  the British Empire&quot; are well worth reading and careful considerations as  shewing  that while some writers  imagine  that we are down  and out 9  others consider that with  our  undeveloped possessions  it  is  still possible to preserve  and continue  under prosperous conditions the British Commonwealth of Nations0  Consequently  I hold strongly that,  if,  through  the Conference  now  sitting, we can bring  about anything like friendly  conditions  in  India9 there will  be  developed  there an ever growing market  for the exchange  of British  and  Indian goods9 but we must create conditions  which will secure confidence and co-operation on both sides  with a  determination, even  at  some  cost,,  to aid each other0Apart

Are members of  the Government telling the  truth when  they              declare this as our.aim and  object?  Will  our Dominion               friends have placed before  them at Ottawa  our own proposals               for the carrying out of our  own declared policy?                        X ask these questions  now &quot;because  we  have months              ahead during which our plans may be  formulated,-,  and  also              because, as 1 understand the proceedings of  the  Imperial              Conference ;just ended, we did not put forward any  scheme              of any kind3 not even the Quota6  We shall be unworthy of              our position as a Government  if we again meet an  Imperial              Conference without being able in  set terms to piaea a              scheme before them for carrying  into effect  our  own declared              policy,,                        This  is all on the  assumption  that  the Cabinet              still accepts the agricultural policy on which we fought              the last election,,  Of course,  if we come to the              conclusion that our policy of 3ulk Purchases etc,, is wrong$ -              then we shotild tell our Party and so cease advocating              something we no longer believe  in,   If,  on the other hand,              we still accept it and are willing to come to an agreement              with the Dominions and any other nation who will come into              line, it is certain such agreement will not merely benefit              the Dominions and foreign governments with whom we trade,-              but will also enable us to organise our  awn  agriculture sa              as to secure for our people an  Increased home market for              manufactured goods and an Increased market for the same              goods in the Dominions and other marketseEMPIRE
0 0 0.0 sj o           The question of migration iss in my view, of overwhelming and increasing Importance,,  The Conference just closed appears to have come to the conclusion that nothing could be done because of trade conditions. If this is the cases then the outlook for western civilisation is indeed very black,,   I understand those who say the world has too much cf everything, &quot;but X do not understand what they mean when, at the same time they say? having produced an abundance$  now let us do our best to curtail or cut down, consumption;.  Looking at the question broadly5 I am not convinced that it is possible to say we shoialdj, as it were,  rest  on our oars and not attempt to exploit or develop  those portions of the earths under the British flag, which  now lie waste and unused0 I  have never been able to accept the view- that because under the competitive system abundance in some places means poverty and misery, that a more equal distribution would give enough for all these in need to have a sufficiency, and consequently it has been my endeavour to secure a better and more  ordered system of production with a mope 4*just system of distribution!.           The demand for- Empire economic  unity is not a wrong or  evil thing,,   In my view .it is something we should strive to secure as the next stage  in Empire development. It  Is true we are separated by waters  but there is such a thing as  spiritual unity which can,  and in my judgment,  will eventuate  in economic unity8   The United States  of America  is  an  amalgam of all paces arid creeds and maintains ati  economic unity which  is  enabling her to conquer- in the open the  open markets of the  worlds   Her economic  plight,  like  ours5  will be solved by the substitution  of  State  control  in place of individualistic and monopolist controls   It is necessary  to  say this because a  unified British Commonwe a 11 h, including India,need not  and  will not be  a  menace to other nations  -  all we should  do  would  be  to  extend to our sister nations  abroad the  same  sort of friendship and unity  as exists inAmerica,  or  exists   between  London and  Leedss  Southampton and  Hull.   I  know 1 shall be told of the enormous tariffdifficulties  but  in time  these  would disappear9  and from our  economic  unity  would  come  in time  that universal  freeexchange  of goods dreamed of by  the  early Free  Trade rsv,           In  these  days of  world competition  anddepressions, we should be  able  to turn  to the Dominionsand  they to us9 and by our  united wisdom and effort createnew  townships  and villages  throughout  those places  atpresent uninhabited^  Within our own shores we  have passedaway  from  the  old &quot;laisser  fairs&quot; condition of  thingeaParliament has voted many millions  of pounds for private and  semi-private and public undertakings0  What  used  to be described&quot; as  the  old self-reliant bxisiness man  trading onhis  ownj has  passed away9 and huge  combines9 relying on national credit arid assistance? have taken Ms place,There  is no earthly reason why we should not inco-operation with the Dominions, loan money and  credit forthe purpose of settlement of hundreds and thousands ofour  people in  the DominionsI  advocate this because I amcertain this  country will never  again be able.to  sustainat  a  standard of  comfort  an educated democracy willdemandj any such population as that which at present Inhabits these Islands^
90 AC-j ftj &apos;x           I am fully acquainted with all the arguments which will be showered upon me to prove how futile it is to talk of migration when many thousands are out of work in the Dominions9 but it is necessary here to repeat that if there is such an abundance of wealth in the Dominions that the mused lands need not be developed9 then all that needs to be done is to distribute the wealths  Of&quot; course we all know that though there is very considerable mal-distribution of wealthy more and more wealth needs producing if the standard of life is to be raised,,           Some of my colleagues have seen the migration scheme which accompanies this as an appendix,,  It was prepared by a Mr,-,  Passmores sent out by Sir Arthur Steel- Maitland when Minister of Labour,,   Although various people have written it dovai as fooliahj, and have attempted to prove its impracticability9 I have discussed it  with Ministers  from Overseas and they all agree it is practicable  and  would woek0   It is necessary to understand that Mr0  Passmore  does not advocate any one of the existing schemes%  on  the  contrail he  is as  convinced as other people that  these  are all failures,,   He asks for a modern or  rationalised  view of the  subject9 and begs that we should look  on the  Dominions as the old pioneers9 who founded the  East India Companys  the Hudson Bay Company9 the Ghartered Company of Cecil Rhodes and Strathcona  and his colleagues9  who ploughed their way across Canada,, These  men in their  day were  ruthless individualistic pioneers  and did many things which would be condemned today9  nevertheless the  Dominions  and Colonies were built up on  their  pioneer work  We can  make  our  charters as we pj.eases  Impose conditions  and control as is being done in Electricity  and  in  a small way in  Coal  in this  country,, The main  thing is  to form  our Companys  give it its charterwith all  its Implications  and set  out to conquer new areas  of  the earth&quot;s surf&apos;ace0  May I very earnestly beg my colleagues to  reads  without  prejudice,  this scheme  of  a devoted Civil  Servants and then decide  that Mr0  Passmore should be asked  to  elaborate  it and  put it  before the appropriate committee dealing with the  Ottawa Conference;.          I  ought also to say  that within the  last  fewmonths 9 Stephen Leacock9 the  Canadians  in his book - &quot;Economic Prosperity of  the British  Empire&quot;9 Chapter 6Spart 2 - very  strongly advocates a similar  scheme,,  Thebook has been widely distributed by  the  Board of Trade of the town of Orillas Ontario 9  Canada,,          I do not  claim that  the  adoptlons even immediatelys of anything I have written  wouids any more than some of our other splendid schemes9 at once  affectthe industrial situation which confronts usD  This? for some time to comes must depend for treatment on  moneypayments to unemployed and destitute people on reliefworks9 etc  But the terrible  difficulties brought  about by the economic bankruptcy of Capitalism and its  supportersneed grappling with along lines which will  ensure nationalcontrol as far as is possible  of Home and Dominiondevelopments leading on to actual Socialism,,  Do not let any of us for  one moment forget that the rationalisation of industry on tho  lines advocated by our colleaguess  and the.appointment of  officials  to push industry along on those  lines9 will Inevitably add to  our  difflculties0Finally
9 9 front-J t-&apos; v/           Finally  I would  urge  that  in these  greatest of all questions concerning national and  international well- he ings all the old war cries are out of datee  None of us are now Free Traders,,  Every Government - Liberals, Tory and ourselves - in one way or another  protects and helps Home and Dominion  trade and industry   We mark British beefs British eggsj display large posters at public expense urging every one to buy certain goodsj we send out Trade Missionsj vote millions for public utilities and their developmente  This is all to the good9 because the more we aid the more right we have to  control.  Because this is the case I want agriculture at home protected^ as we imagined it would be when we wrote &quot;Labour and the Nation&quot; 3 and I want migration reorganised as we pi^omised it should beG           I do not forget  immediate problems connected with wages in the great basic industries such as Goals Cottons Iron and Steely Transports, etc  My opinion is that the more wages are cut down, the more  the standard of life is depressed, the more unemployment we  shall be cursedwitho   Therefore j, I very much hope we  shall pay no heed tothe Geddes axe proposals, or in  any way  directly or indirectly support those who are engaged in striving to: force wages down8H,M, Office of Works0  G9 Li.22nd Novembero 19300
o*j Qen.SUGGESTIONS FOR SPEEDING-OP LAUD&quot;   DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTRALIA.     It may perhaps be assumed that an extended developmentof Australian primary industries is essential if there is tobe any great increase in the. general prosperity of theCountry.   Under present conditions, the rate at whichadditional land is cleared and cultivated is hopelessly slow.Individual settlers with little or no capital take years tobring under cultivation 1,000 acres of bush and scrub.   Henceit is that only a small fraction of the alienated land hasbeen touched and In States like Western Australia there aremillions of acres of land, suitable for growing wheat,.notyet opened up.   The Agent-General says that 37,000,000 acrescould be thrown open.     But capital is essential for the purpose, and, under thepresent economic conditions, it is not available fromAustralian sources.     Land clearing, provision of buildings, v/ater, etc., inthis new country should be undertaken as a large scaleoperation.     I, therefore, suggest that an experiment be made on thefollowing lines8-     (l) A company be formed in London.to operate in  Australia under a measure of British Government control.     (2) The company to acquire (say) 1^000^000 acres of  suitable land from the State Government of Western  Australia.     (3) The company to employ only British migrants save  for supervisory staff.     (4) Land to be cleared by the employment of British  migrants on piece work.     (5) Wheat to be grown pending the allocation of blocks  of land to individual settlers.     (6) Eventually the land to be settled by the  establishment of 1,000 acre farms.     I have worked out the details of one scheme of thiskind (notes attached)^   The figures of costs of production,clearing, etc., have been checked against actual contractprices paid in Australia.     I am oonvinoed that some such revolutionary change inour method of dealing with Australian migration is necessary.Australia oan make no rapid progress without the applicationof&apos;capital on a large scale.   Further negotiations withFederal and State Governments is, under present conditions,a waste of time.   They cannot be expected to requisitionmigrants unless they are sure of finding employment forthem.   But they  could not well oppose the introduction ofmigrants for employment by a company on the  lines proposed.It
?cy 7      It would,, of courses, be z-tecaasary to convince theState Government of the soundness of the proposal0   in western Australia it is said that for every man successfullysettled on the lands there is an addition of eight souls tothe population of the state   Many of these would, doubtlesscome out from Great Britain under nomination or otherwise,,      Ifj, therefore- development of the Country and increased population are what the State is really anxiousto secure^ the scheme should be highly attractive to theState Governmentu(Signed)   JoRsJ.

The figures given in the accompanying statement are basedupon the following assumptions?-     (l)   That the Government of Western Australia Would be willing to sell tho land to such a corporation as that described     (2)   That the average price of the land before clearingis 7/6d, per acre.     (5)   That all migrants would pass the test imposed by australia House in respect of medical fitness and otherwise0     (4)   That none but single men be selected for the firstbatch of 5,000.     (8)   That a steady flow of 400 approved migrants would be forthcoming each month-, divided as to -                    100 Ministry of Labour trainees?                    S00 untrained miners.     (6)    That to attain the progress indioated by the specifieddate the scheme is launched not later than 1st July, 1929*     (7)   That the land is selected in sufficient proximity toa railway to obviate the need for the construction of a privateline.     (8)   That the type of country selected should be lightlytimbered or scrubland and that the average cost of clearing per acre should not exceed SO/-,     (9)   That water can bo obtained by boring at a number of points  sufficient for domestic and stock purposes,,     (10-)  That the present price of approximately 6/- per bushelfor  wheat still obtains and that an average yield of 12 bushelsper  acre is realised from the first year8s crop0   (The averageyield for the Oommonvfealth is 13.7).NOTEs^   Since this  scheme was drafted there has been a fall in     wheat prices and 5/- per bushel may now.be regarded as too     high.

Pro-posed scheme of Land Development axid       Settlement in Y/estern Australiaofoduotion of sh Migrants.d ofopment,     The Company is being formed with the object of acquiring and developing large blocks of land in australia for the purpose of settling British migrants - mainly coalminers.   It is proposed3 In the first instance, toacquire, if possible, a million acres of virgin land inthe wheat Belt in western Australia with an option on afurther million acres.     It is estimated that 5,000 British migrants could beemployed in clearing, developing and cultivating this landfor a period of three or four years.   It is proposed to spread the introduction of these 5,000 men over a periodOf not less than twelve months   A limited amount ofdevelopment work would be carried out by a working partybefore the first batch of migrants arrived,,  There after ,clearing and development work would be undertakenexclusively by British migrants under the supervision of skilled Australian bushmen and agriculturalists0     It is proposed to develop the land in small blocks of approximately 1,000 acres.   Each such block will be complete as to clearing, development, water supply,buildings, equipment, implements, etc.   As these blocksare completed they woL\ld be sold to approved Britishsettlers with or without capital resources.   Settlerswithout capital would, for the purpose of the purchaseof a block, receive advances from the Western Australianstate Agricultural Bank.   In so far as these advances weroIn respeot of expenditure by the Company, they would bepaid direct to the Company as a partial or completeliquidation of the liability of the settler In respect                                                    of
           of his purchase.   Generally, in carrying out development           on the land, the object to be aimed at is to leave           developed holdings of approximately 1,000 acres ready           in all essential respects for occupation by settlersc ation^of        As the land is cleared and &quot;burnt off&quot; it will be cior toTTIPNO;     cultivated in large blocks by the British migrants in the           employ of the Company.   For this purpose a proportion of           the migrants so employed will be British Ministry of           Labour trainees, experienced in the cultivation of land           with Australian implementss tackle, etc  It is estimated           that 5 subject to the assumptions set out in the prefatory           note9 approximately 6009000 acres will have been           cultivated and cropped by the 31st December, 1951e-on of the       Save for certain necessary supervisory and teclinica3.its emplojyjgdpany.      staffg all the men employed on the land must be migrants           from Great Britain.   Each migrant will be required to           pass the tests, medical and otherwise., applied, in general           to migrants for Australia, and will be required to sign a           contract for a year8s employment, subject to good conduct,           etc , with the Company.   For the first month of employment           in Australia, a time wage of 50/- per week, or 30/- plus           keep, will be paid.   Thereafter on clearing work, an           appropriate piece rate.  On the work of cultivation, etc ?           a time rate of 50/- or 50/- plus keep.  All of the           5,000 migrants must be single men.   They will, however,           in due course 9 be eligible for consideration when blocks           are allocated to settlers, but no promise of such           allocation will be given.
