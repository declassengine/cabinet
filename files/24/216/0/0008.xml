REPORT   OF   MISSION.                     I INTRODUCTORY.          (a) Appointment and  Composition of Mission.    1.   ON the 24th July, 1980,  the  Economic Advisory Council (E.A.C./7th  Meeting,  Conclusion 2  (c)) appointed a  Committee with the following terms of reference :        &quot; To examine the figures of unemployment benefit and their    significance, and to indicate the abuses which have grown up in    the system and to submit recommendations  for their removal.&quot;    2.   The Committee is constituted as follows : -       Mr. G. D. H. Cole (Chairman).       Sir John Cadman, G.C.M.G.       Sir Sydney Chapman,  K.C.B.,  C.B.E.,  Chief Economic          Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government.       Mr. H. D. Henderson.          Mr.  H.  V.  Hodson,  Assistant, -\             Economic Advisory Council     [joint Secretaries to          Mr. H.  C. Emmerson,  Ministry of r  the Committee.             Labour                        J    8.  At an early stage of their  inquiry,  the  Committee decided that it was essential that they should obtain first-hand evidence of the working of the German unemployment insurance scheme and of the provision of relief work in  that country.  The  Committee, therefore, invited Mr. H. D. Henderson, Joint Secretary, Economic Advisory Council, one of then- members, and Mr. H. C.  Emmerson, Ministry of Labour, Joint Secretary to the Committee, to proceed to Germany for the  purpose  of  obtaining this  information.   By arrangement  with  the Ministry of Labour, Mr.  F. S. Flint, of that Department,  accompanied the Mission.  The Mission left London on the 17th September, 1930.   4.  In submitting our Beport  we desire to bear testimony to the great  assistance that we received at the hands of  the officials of the German  Ministry  of Labour-,  who  did everything possible to assist  us  in  our inquiry and were,  indeed, our main source of information.   In  addition,  we  interviewed  Dr.  Preuss,  of  the Allgemeine  Elektrizitats  Gesellschaft,  and Herr  Spliedt,  the Secretary of  the  General  Federation of German Trade  Unions. Through the courtesy of the President of the Reichsanstalt we visited two employment exchanges and inspected a scheme  of relief work in Berlin.   5.  We desire  also to  place on record our indebtedness to the Foreign Office, who made the necessary arrangements for our visitwith  the  German Government.   We  wish   also   to  take  this opportunity of expressing our  thanks  to  His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Berlin and to his staff  and,  in particular,  to the Commercial Secretariat.   6.   As regards unemployment insurance, we found it necessary strictly to limit the  inquiry to  particular aspects of the Germanscheme which  are of  special interest  to  the  Committee.   Thequestions to which we gave special attention were as follows :    (a)  the general  structure  of  the  German  unemployment          insurance scheme;   (b)  the provisions of the scheme as they affect:            (i) short-time workers,          (ii) casual workers,          (hi) seasonal workers, and          (iv) married  women;   (c)  rates of benefit and wages;   (d)  emergency  benefit and  the  means  test  in  the case of          emergency benefit.

                  (b) Arrangement of Report.   7.  We have divided our Report into two main parts.  In thefirst (Section II) we give a general commentary on unemploymentinsurance in  Germany.   In Section III  we  describe Germanunemployment relief works.  We have attached to our Eeport eightAppendices,  which give  a detailed comparison of particular  aspectsof unemployment insurance in Great Britain and Germany.   II.-GENERAL  COMMENTARY  UPON   THE  GERMAN          UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SCHEME.    8.   The unemployment insurance scheme in Germany lacks the simplicity  of the English scheme,  partly because it  is associated with,  and grafted on, the much  older  system of State  Health Insurance, and partly because the  Germans have attempted, by a complicated system of rules, to guard against excessive payments of benefit to certain classes of claimants.  It is complicated also by the fact that the administration is devolved upon divisional offices,  who are given much  greater powers than in Great  Britain, so that the system is not uniform throughout the  country.    9.   There are some  striking similarities between the general conditions  and the problems of  unemployment insurance in Great Britain and  Germany.  In both  countries  there  is a  system of ordinary benefit  on an insurance basis, which is supplemented by a scheme of extended benefit limited to insured persons.  In Germany this &apos;,&apos;  emergency &quot; benefit is borne to the extent of four-fifths by the Federal  Government and one-fifth by the  Local  Authorities; in Great  Britain the Exchequer  bears the full cost of &quot; transitional benefit.&quot;  Both countries are faced with the problems occasioned by short-time  working,  seasonal  employment,  casual  methods of engagement and claims by married women.  In Germany also, the insurance scheme  has been in financial difficulties and has had to borrow money  from  the  State.   The question of  making  the unemployment insurance scheme self-supporting is, indeed, one of first-class importance  in  Germany, where  the general financial position is much more acute than in this country.   10.  While, in broad outline, the two unemployment insurance schemes are  similar, there  are some striking  differences.   In the first place, the administration of  Employment Exchanges  and of the  unemployment  insurance  scheme is  in  the hands  of  an autonomous body,  the Beichsanstalt.  The Minister  of Labour exercises ultimate supervision over this body, but the Beichsanstalt has considerable powers of independent action.   The Administrative Council of the  Beiehsanstalt is  composed of  a  Chairman  (the President of the  Beichsanstalt)  and  of  equal representation of employers, workers  and  local  authorities.  This  Council  is  the authority   in  general  charge  of  employment  exchanges   and unemployment   insurance.    For   purposes   of   unemployment insurance,  the representatives of the local authorities  take no  part in the work.  The Minister of  Labour is responsible  for general policy.  It is of particular interest to note that  the Council may, in certain cases,  with the approval of the Minister of Labour, make regulations in deviation  from the  general provisions of the Act. For  example  the  Council  has  made regulations  regarding  the payment of benefit to such  classes of claimants as  short-time workers, casual workers, etc., which exercise a most important effect on the working of  the scheme.   This system of  administration results  in  a  much  greater degree of flexibility  in  the  general administration of the scheme than is possible in Great Britain where no deviation  from the detailed  provisions of  the UnemploymentInsurance Acts is permissible.   11.   Another fundamental difference is  that in principle  thescheme is financed by contributions from employers and  workersonly, and is  not based upon a  tripartite  arrangement  as in  thiscountry.
    12.  Further,  the  qualifying conditions for  the  receipt  ofbenefit  are  much stricter than  those laid down in the  Englishscheme,  and a definite limit is placed upon the period for whichbenefit, either ordinary or transitional,  can be drawn.   beyond those limits an unemployed worker is relieved according to his  needby  the Poor Law Authorities.    18.  Another outstanding difference is that  the  rates of  con-tribution and  of benefit are not  flat rates, varying only accordingto  age and  sex, but  rates based upon the principle  of proportion to wages, irrespective of age or sex.              (a) General  Structure of the  Scheme.    14.  Unemployment insurance  became operative in Germany Appendix I,on  the 1st October, 1927, hut before that date there  was a scheme Para-1-of  unemployment  relief,  with  contributions of  employers  and workers.  The scheme covers  some 17^  million insured workers.It insures against unemployment, in addition to the classes coveredby  the English scheme, agricultural workers (about  1,000,000 outof  2,500,000), domestic  servants,  and  salaried and non-manual workers earning up to 8,400 marks  ( 420) a year (in Great Britainnon-manual workers  earning  more  than   250  a  year  are notinsured).    Persons  over 65 and under  16 years  of age are not excluded, as they are in Great Britain.    15.  Contributions. Contributions  are paid in  equal propor- Appendix I,tions by the employer and the worker, the total contribution  from Para-2-the 1st August, 1930, being 4^ per cent, of a basic wage determined for sickness insurance purposes (subject to a maximum basic  wageof  8,600 marks ( 180) per annum, or 70 marks per  week).   Sincethe 6th  October,  1930,  the  contribution has been  raised to6^  per cent.   The sum representing the employees and worker&apos;s share  of the contribution  is paid by the employer to the sicknessinsurance   society,  which remits  it to  the  competent   StateEmployment Exchange.    16.   Ordinary Benefit. The general  conditions for the receipt Appendix I,of  ordinary benefit  are  very  similar  to those of  the  English Paras- 3-7-scheme, but in Germany the initial  qualifying condition is verymuch  stricter.  In  Great Britain a claimant  who  can show thathe  has paid thirty  contributions in the preceding two years canqualify for  ordinary  benefit.   A contribution is  paid in respect ofemployment in any  calendar week; it  may,  in fact,  representemployment on one  day or on six days in any week.  In Germany,a claimant must be able to show that he has had 52 weeks&apos; employ-ment (i.e.,  812 working days) in the preceding two years; the periodof two years can be extended to three years in some cases.  whereas in  Great  Britain ordinary benefit is payable for 74 weeks in twoyears  to  a  person who has had insurable employment in thirtyconsecutive weeks,  in Germany ordinary benefit is payable  for26  weeks  only.   When  26 weeks&apos; benefit has been  drawn, theclaimant  can requalify  for benefit  only  if he can  show that hehas worked 26 weeks in a year (or three years in some cases).   the qualifying condition is temporarily even stricter for persons in thehighest wage classes.    17.   Emergency  Benefit. Emergency  benefit   closely  corre- Appendixsponds to  transitional benefit in this country, but in  Germany VII.the qualifying condition is much stricter, and emergency benefit is paid only to certain classes of persons in industrial groups prescribed by  Order of  the  Minister of Labour.   The  rates  of  emex-gencybenefit are less  in  the  highest   wage  classes than  the  ratesof  ordinary benefit.   Moreover, in  each class  it is a maximum rate and is subject to a means test,  whereby benefit is reduced in. accordance  with a fixed scale if the family income is in excess of  acertain amount.  Emergency benefit is payable for 39 weeks, or for52  weeks in the case of persons over 40 years of age when the stateof  employment justifies this extension, and in no circumstances isit  extended beyond  these limits.   In Great Britain there  is, nosuch limit.
   18.  In  Germany  the  principle is generally  accepted  thatunemployed workers who are not able  to  qualify for ordinary  oremergency benefit or for whom benefit  is insufficient should have recourse to the Poor Law.  The Poor Law is administered by localauthorities, and applicants  for relief are subjected to a means testand to investigation of personal and  family circumstances.                           (b) Rates of Benefit and Wages.Appendix       19.   Every insured worker in Germany is classified for benefit           purposes in  one of eleven  wage  classes.   The  wage class  is, in           principle, determined by the average earnings of the claimant over           a fixed period;  but, in order to remedy anomalies due to disparities           between  the basic  wage for contribution purposes and the  actual           earnings, the  wage class is now determined  by the  basic wage           adopted for sickness insurance purposes.  Board and lodgings are           taken into  account in determining the wage class, e.g.,  in the case           of domestic servants.  Benefit is  a  fixed percentage of a so-called           unit wage  in   each  wage  class.   (This   &quot; unit wage &quot;  is  not           necessarily the same as the &quot; basic  wage &quot;  on  which the contribu-           tion is paid.) .  The rate of benefit varies from  75 per cent,  of the           unit wage  (8 EM.) in the lowest  class to 85 per cent,  of  the unit           wage  (68   RM.)  in  the   highest  wage   class.   There  is   no           differentiation on the ground of age  or sex.  Dependants&apos;  benefit is           paid at the rate of 5 per cent, of the unit wage  for each  dependant,           subject,  however,  to an over-riding maximum for principal  and           dependants&apos;  benefit  together of 80  per  cent, of the unit  wage in           the two lowest classes and 60 per cent, of the unit wage in the four           highest classes. The highest rate of benefit payable is  87-80 BM.           a week.               20.  This system of differential rates is commonly regarded in           Germany as preferable to  a system of  flat rates of contributions           and benefit.  The view taken is that the rate of benefit should be           related to loss of earnings, and that the skilled worker in the highest           wage class has a higher standard of living, when in employment,           and can afford to pay a higher contribution, while needing a higher           rate of benefit when unemployed.  The rates of emergency benefit           are lower in the higher classes than the rates  of ordinary benefit,           and, as already stated, emergency benefit is  paid subject to a means           test only to workers in certain industries specified by Order  of the           Minister of Labour.               21.  The casual earnings of an unemployed person  during the           period  of unemployment, if they exceed one-fifth of the  full benefit           payable (including dependants&apos; allowances),  reduce the benefit paid           according to a formula which is given in Appendix I, paragraph 8 (ii),           page 16.   Benefit may also  be reduced  by the amount (in  whole           or in part) of certain pensions  and social allowances.  These rules           apply to both ordinary and  emergency  benefit.  A more detailed           examination  of  the  benefit  scales and  their relation to  wages is           given in Appendix VI and  a  list of  the   occupations  entitled to           emergency benefit  is  given  in  Appendix VII,  pages  32  and  85.           The outstanding points are  as follows :                (1)  Both  rates  of wages  and real wages are lower in  Germany                    than  in  Great Britain.               (2)  The general level of unemployment benefits is also lower in                    Germany than in  Great Britain  though in  a few cases                    the actual rates of benefit are higher.               (3)  The rates of unemployment  benefit  are  lower in Germany                     than the rates of sickness  benefit, in  striking  contrast to                    Great Britain.Appendices         (c) Provisions Affecting II-V. (i) Short-Time  Workers. (ii) Casual Workers.(iii) Seasonal Workers. (iv) Married  Women.   22.  The Germans  have  experienced  the  same difficulty  as ourselves in providing against excessive payments of unemploymentbenefit to the classes of persons referred to above, and attempts have been  made,  with varying degrees  of  success,  to  safeguard  the
  Insurance Fund while protecting the interests of those workers who  can legitimately  look for support to a Fund to which  they have  contributed.  The seasonal workers&apos; problem is much more acute in  Germany because of the greater climatic difference between summer  and winter conditions.   On  the  other hand,  their dock labour  problem is less acute than it is with us, mainly because they have  fewer ports, and  greater progress has been made with registration  schemes,  particularly  in  Hamburg.    German   unemployment  insurance covers  a certain  proportion of the workers engaged in  agriculture,  and serious abuses in this connection, which are found  to be difficult to legislate against, are not present in Great Britain.     28.   The provisions now in force  are complicated;  they are described in Appendices II-V, pages 20 to 30.  The guiding principle  for short-time  workers is of  considerable  interest.   Briefly,  the  position is that no benefit  is paid unless a worker on short time has  been unemployed at least  three days a calendar week; but whereas in Great Britain  benefit would then become payable for  the  full three days of unemployment, in Germany only one day&apos;s benefit, at the same rate of payment as for ordinary benefit, is paid to a short- time worker without dependants who is unemployed for three days. If four clays in a week are lost,  two days&apos; benefit is paid; if five days are lost, three days&apos;  benefit is paid.  A worker who is unemployed alternate calendar weeks is regarded as having an average unemploy- ment of three days in each week and accordingly receives one day&apos;s benefit in respect  of each  week. No account is taken of hours lost on  particular  clays.   Short-time  workers with  dependants  are treated more favourably.   There is an overriding consideration that the wages received, together with the short-time benefit, must  not exceed  five-sixths  of the wages for a full working week.    24.   Before benefit becomes payable, a special waiting period must be served by the industrial undertaking, which must show that it has lost at least eight full working clays  in consecutive calendar weeks,  with  at least two days lost in each week.  The employer or the Works  Council must  give  the Exchange notice  of short-time working  and must make the  claim  on  behalf  of the  persons concerned.   No  short-time  benefit is  paid  to certain classes of workers,  e.g.,  railway  workers,  dock  labourers  and domestic servants.    25.   Short-time working  in Germany occurs mainly in the textile industries, boot and shoe making, coal mining and, to some extent, in engineering. There was, unfortunately, not time to investigate the operation of the  system, and further detailed inquiries would be necessary before  a final opinion could be expressed upon its merits.  There is no doubt, however, that the limits are so narrowly drawn that  they have very considerably  restricted the payments of benefit  to short-time  workers, while at the same time making it possible to supplement the wages of persons who are working only half-time or less.    26.   The German  Ministry  of Labour does not claim that the position as regards excessive payments is  now satisfactory, but there is no doubt  that  in the case of short-time workers  and married women  a good deal has been clone to meet the difficulty. In the case of casual workers  a further order is in draft,  the details of which are not  yet available.                    (d) Financial Difficulties.    27.   The heavy increase in unemployment  arising from the world depression has  entailed a correspondingly heavy increase inthe  expenditure on unemployment benefit,  which,  as  in GreatBritain, constitutes one of the main sources of embarrassment to the finances of the  Reich.   The German Budget is, indeed, exposed toeven more serious immediate disturbance than the British  Budgetfrom fluctuations in unemployment; for the Reich is precluded by oneof the provisions of the fundamental Budget law, designed to guard against the danger  of a ronewal of inflation, from borrowing the sumsrequired to make good a deficit in the Insurance Fund.  If the fund is running at a loss,  the Reichsanstalt obtains advances from the
reich, which are in the form of loans and are technically, at least,repayable;  but the reich itself must find  the money for these advances  out of  the revenue  for the  year.  For  this reason, the equilibrium of  the German budget is liable to be most seriouslyupset by a huge growth in unemployment expenditure, such as hastaken place in  the past year.    28.  The position on the 15th September, 1930, was  that about,983,000  persons  were unemployed.   Of these,  about 1,504,000persons were drawing ordinary benefit and another 459,000 persons were  receiving emergency benefit,  making  a  total  of  1,963,000persons in receipt of benefit.   It will thus be observed that a much larger  number of  the unemployed  are  ineligible for  benefit inGermany  than  is the case in Britain.   We were informed that over600,000 unemployed persons were being relieved  by  the poor-law.None the less, the German total of 1,963,000 persons drawing benefit from the insurance fund is comparable with our own, and represents a substantially greater increase since the world slump began; thetotal number  in  receipt of  ordinary and  emergency  benefit inGermany having been 864,000 in July  1929.  Moreover, the rate of increase  in unemployment has been  highest  among the highly-skilled workers in the higher wage groups, who receive the highestrates of benefit;  so that the expenditure falling on the Fund hasincreased  even  more rapidly than the above  figures would suggest.    29.  The revenue derived  from the contributions of  employersand employed  has proved quite insufficient  to  meet  these growingdemands, and the debt of the Beichsanstalt increased during the yearAugust 1929 to July 1930 by  over   32 millions to a total of over 44 millions.  Moreover,  despite the fact that the contributionspayable by employers  and employed  were  increased as  from the1st August, 1930, from 8  per cent, to A\ per cent, of the basic wage,and despite economies in benefit effected by the Emergency Order ofthe 28th July,  1930, the deficit in the fund was still, at the timeof  our  visit, increasing rapidly  each week.  The expenditure underthe Employment Exchanges and  Unemployment Insurance Act,over and above the income from contributions,  at the end of July1930 was  as follows :                                                       Millions.                                                            *(1)  Deficit of the Insurance Fund  ...     ...    ...    44-2  *(2)  Total  expenditure since the  1st October, 1927,          on emergency benefit scheme      ...    ...    24-5    (8)  Expenditure of Reich on special seasonal benefit          scheme, winter 1929  (scheme now lapsed) ...      5-3             Excess expenditure since the 1st October,                1927    ...............     74-0    80.   We  found, accordingly,  that  discussions were  activelyproceeding about the measures necessary to deal with the  financialposition oi&apos; the Fund.   It was taken for granted in all quarters thata further substantial increase would  be made in the contributions of employers and employed;  and, since our return, the rate of contribution ha3 been increased, by a, decree which became operativeon  the 6th October, 1930, to 6-\ per cent, of  the basic wage.  Thus,within the space of a  few months, the contributions of employersand employed towards unemployment insurance have been  raised from 8-  per cent, to 6^ per cent., or very nearly doubled.  This isdespite the fact that the rate of contribution both to unemploymentinsurance and  to  social insurance generally was  previously verymuch heavier in Germany than in Great Britain.   A contribution of 67 per cent, for  unemployment insurance works out, on a basicwage of 50 marks, to about  8/Sd.  a  week, as compared with a combined contribution  in Great Britain from employer  and workerof  l/8d.  for an adult man.   Moreover, even before  the  recent increase,  the total  contributions  of employers  and  workers inGermany for all social insurances represented 15 per cent,  of the   * Tho first two iteni9 include money spent on various moasures authorised by tho Act for the relief of unemployment, including the &quot; basio assistance &quot;in respect of relief works.  They do not, however, include the sums advanced by the Reich and  the States as &quot; extended assistance &quot; in respect of reliefworks, most of which, it is understood, is recoverable.
weekly wage, whereas the comparable figure in Great Britain wouldbe more like 51- per cent, on a weekly wage of 50/.   81.  In addition to the recent decree increasing the rate of contribution to 6  per cent.,  the statement issued by the GermanGovernment on the 80th September, 1980, concerning its financialprogramme contains the following passage :        The balancing of income and expenditure for unemployment   insurance will  in  future be  secured  without  calling  upon the   budget of the Beich.  The share of the Beich in expenditure for   emergency relief will be limited in  the budget  to 420  million   Beichsmarks.   A basic reform  of the unemployment  insurance   system is being prepared.&quot;In other words, the policy of the German Government is to insist that, apart from its contribution to emergency benefit (on which amaximum limit is to be placed), the unemployment insurance systemmust be made self-supporting.   82.  It seems likely that the reforms foreshadowed in the aboveextract from  the  statement of  the German Government will  also include  proposals  designed to reduce the volume of  expenditure.We found considerable interest  in Germany  in the question  how this could be done.  Concrete  suggestions mentioned  to us were that the period for which a claimant is entitled to ordinary benefit should be reduced from 26 weeks to 15 weeks,  and that the present rates of emergency benefit should be reduced  for the higher-wageclasses.   88.  There  is  thus  a  broad  similarity  of  outline,   with considerable diversity of detail, both in the unemployment insurance schemes of Germany and Great Britain,  and in the serious financial difficulties which  have resulted from them in  the present trade depression.   Broadly,  the  conditions   for obtaining  benefit  arestricter in Germany than in Great Britain. But, as against this,the German scheme is exposed to financial difficulties  from whichours is free, as the result of its more comprehensive scope, and, inparticular,  its  extension  to  agriculture.   The  financial  problemresulting is  probably even more serious  in Germany, because ofthe greater stringency  of the general financial position.  Ill__UNEMPLOYMENT  RELIEF WORKS  IN GERMANY.   84.  The  German Employment Exchanges and UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1927-80,  states specifically that &quot;unemploymentshall be prevented  and ended primarily by the placing of workersin employment,&quot;  and  unemployment relief works, or the so-called&quot; productive relief works,&quot; have occupied a prominent position inthe German system.   85.  The  chief provisions governing unemployment  relief works in Germany  are  contained in Clause 189 of  the Act  and in twoOrders  issued by  the  Federal   Employment  Exchanges  and unemployment Insurance Board (Beichsanstalt) and by the FederalMinistry  of  Labour,  dated the   28th  March, 1928,  and  the29th March, 1928, respectively.   86.  These provisions relate  solely to unemployment relief workspromoted under the Act.   They do not relate to general housingschemes  and to the accelerated programmes of the  Federal posts and telegraphs and the Federal railways, designed to offer increasedopportunities  of employment; nor do they relate to subsidies whichmay have been granted to industry, or to the export credits scheme.These latter measures are not dealt with here.                     (a) General  Principles.   87.  In considering the German system of unemployment reliefworks under  the  Act,  it is  necessary to  distinguish between  twokinds  of relief work          (a) minor  works.         (b) major works.    [21889]                                              o
In the ease of minor works, the financial assistance provided comes from  the  funds  of  the  Federal  Employment  Exchanges  and unemployment Insurance  Board if  the relief workers  are entitledto standard benefit, from the funds  of the  Federal Government(four-fifths) and of the Communes (one-fifth) if the  relief workers are entitled to emergency  benefit, and from the funds of the poorlaw authorities if  the relief workers are on poor law relief.   38.  So far as relief workers entitled to standard or emergencybenefit are concerned, the amount of  money  provided  is restricted to the amount saved in benefit, and a  maximum sum of 3 RM. perman-day is fixed.  The money so provided is called basic assistance,and minor relief works  receive basic assistance only.   89.  Major relief  works  receive,  in  addition  to  the  basicassistance from the Federal Board, what is called extended assistancein equal amounts  from the funds of the Federal Government andthe State  benefiting by the work.  Extended assistance is grantedonly when a maximum basic  assistance of 3  RM.  a  day has beengranted to the relief work by the Federal Board.  The amount  ofthe extended assistance may not, as a rule,  exceed four times the basic  assistance, and in any case the basic and  extended assistancetogether (when the latter is given in  the form  of a  loan) may notexceed 80 per  cent, of the total cost of the work.   40.  Extended assistance is granted only in the  case of worksproviding at least  2,000 man-days&apos; work.  .41.  Both basic and extended assistance are granted either  inthe form  of irrecoverable  advances  or as loans.  It is understoodthat,  in  general,  basic  assistance  is  granted in  the form  ofirrecoverable advances  and extended  assistance as  loans.  these loans  are at a rate of interest, i.e.,  4 or 5  per  cent., which  isconsidered low in  Germany.   42.  Only those works receive  financial  assistance  which areof productive  value to the nation, in especial works which will increase  home-produced food  supplies or raw materials,  or willcreate new opportunities for work or lead  to  a  more advantageousdistribution of the labour  power of the nation.  Only such worksas  could  not otherwise  be  undertaken  can receive  financialassistance.   43.  Belief works under the Act can be  put in  hand only  by public authorities,  e.g., municipalities, town councils,  etc., or  by&quot;mixed-economic&quot;  and private undertakings.   Assistance can  begranted to the latter only if they serve the common weal.   44.  Financial  assistance  cannot  be  given to  private  under-takings carried on for  profit.   45.  As a general rule, public authorities may not themselvescarry out the works, but must give them out to a contractor, and endeavour to  restrict his  profits to the lowest possible limit.  Theworks must as far as possible  be such  as require labour rather thanmaterials.   46.   The relief worker receives the locally agreed or prevailingrate for his work, but an upper  limit may be  set to this rate.Normally,  a relief worker may not be employed on relief works  for more  than  thirteen weeks.   His employment  as  a relief  workeris an  insurable occupation,  and may qualify him  for emergencybenefit.&quot;   47.   The kind of work hitherto put in hand under this scheme has been improvements to land and waterways;  power installations;long  distance gas  conduits;  aqueducts;   water   conduits;  roadbuilding; excavations; drainage; rural housing;* etc.   * Rural housing is promoted from tho funds of  the Federal Governmentand tho States.  Tho Fcdoral Board does not contribute.  Between 1921 and the end of 1929, 56,259 agricultural workors&apos; dwellings were built under  theschemo, one of the objects of which is to facilitate a &quot; return to tho land.&quot;
            (b) The German Public Works Company.    48.   During the last five or six years  the Federal Government has advanced, as extended assistance to unemployment relief works, (he sum of 350 to 400 million EM. in the form of loans, and the interest,  and  amortisation on this  money now  amount to 35  to 40 million EM. per annum.  The money  for the purpose of relief works has been voted each year by the Eeichstag.    49.   In order  to avoid the annual  discussion over the  amount of this Vote and to mobilize the capital already advanced for relief works, a  company called  the German Public Works Company was established by the Federal Government at  the end of  July 1930. This  company is  registered  under the ordinary  German company laws; its  assets  are the Federal Governments claims (which have been  transferred to the Company) to the refundment of  the 350  to 400 million EM. referred to above;  and it  will in future  receive the interest and amortisation on this sum.  The  sole  shareholder in the company  is the German Government.    50.   The  board of  directors  of  the  German Public Works Company will consist of representatives of  the  various interests, including a Government Commissioner, who is a high official of the Federal Ministry of Labour.    51.   One of the chief objects  in founding this company  is  to raise  foreign loans on  the &apos;&apos; assets&apos;&apos; of the company, on which the interest &quot;will be lower thanjm money borrowed in Germany.  From the funds so raised and in hand  will, in  future, be advanced the Federal Governmenfs extended assistance to unemployment relief works.   52.  It is not proposed to alter  the principles on which grants or loans are made for unemployment relief works.  The new company will merely take over the responsibility hitherto borne by the Federal Government.  The presence of a  Government Commissioner  fromthe Federal Ministry of  Labour  and   of  officials  from otherMinistries  will ensure that  the  operations  of  the Company are subject to the general control of the Federal Government.                      (o)  Practical Results.   53.  The practical  results of the system outlined above, so faras numbers of persons employed are concerned,  are shown in thefollowing Table :                                            Average number of                                          persons employed eachYear.                            month on relief works.1925 ...     ...     ...      ...     ...      51,9191926 ...............     128,9741927 ...............     117,6331928 ...     ...     ...      ...     ...      62,6941929 ...............      53,681Owing to lack of money, the number this  year has fallen to about27,000  a month.

   54.  It may be of interest to  give some particulars of a relief work inspected in Berlin.  The work in question is the extension ofthe underground railway at the Alexanderplatz and Jannowitzbrucke.The underground railway is owned by two companies, in which the sole  shareholder  is  the  city  of Berlin.   On this  work some70 to 75  per cent,  of  the persons  employed are relief workers.They  provide practically the  whole of the unskilled labour.  the skilled workers  are not  relief workers.  It was stated that, owingto the employment of relief workers, there had been some  slowing down  of  the  work, but  that  latterly an  improvement in the rateof working had taken place.   55.  The  total cost  of the work is estimated at approximately 1\ million.  The basic assistance from  the funds of the FederalBoard is estimated at about  800,000,  and the extended assistancefrom the funds  of the Federal Government and the State of  Prussiaat about  1,200,000.   56.  The  basic assistance  amounts to  3 BM. per man per shift,and three shifts a day are being worked. This money has been given as an irrecoverable  grant.   The extended assistance  from  theFederal Government and the State of Prussia amounts to 12 BM.per man per shift, divided equally. This  money has been advancedas a loan, on which the interest is  4 to 5 per cent.                          (Signed)     H.  D. HENDERSON.                                       H.  C.

APPENDIX I.GENERAL, OUTLINE OF THE SCHEMES.GREAT BRITAIN.GERMANY.    1. Scope of the Scheme.   (i)  The    English    schemeapplies  to non-manual  workersearning not more than  250 perannum,   and  to  all   manual workers with certain exceptions,of which the most important areprivate  domestic  service,   agri-culture,  and certain  classes  ofrailway  workers.  (ii) There  is no  difference  inthe classes of industrial workersentitled to ordinary benefit andtransitional benefit.       2. Contributions.  (i) The  rate  of contribution for  an adult male is 1/Sd. fromemployer and employee, or about-5  per cent, of a weekly wage of50/-.   There is  also a contribu-tion from the Exchequer of 7-J-ci.  (ii) The  total   contribution from  employer and worker  forunemployment, health insurance and contributory old age pensionin  respect  of an  adult  maleis 2/9i.  or 5  per cent, of a weekly wage of 50/-.     1.  Scope of the Scheme.   (i) The     German   scheme applies to  all manual workers, including employees  in agricul- ture,   and   domestic  servants, and  to  non-manual   workers earning not  more  than  8,400 marks  per   annum.   Out  of 2,500,000 persons in agriculture about   1,500,000   are   exempt. Certain classes of railway workers are exempt (as  civil  servants or quasi civil servants).   (ii) Emergency benefit is paid only   to   selected   classes   of workers as prescribed  by Order of the Minister of Labour.  (Miners, for example, are  excluded  be- cause,  until recently, unemploy- ment among miners was low.)        2. Contributions.   (i) In Germany the  contribu- tion  (divided  equally  between employer   and  worker)  varies with the wage.  At present it is 61- per cent, of a basic wage, which  is limited to a maximum of 70 marks a week or 300 marks a  month.    The basic wage is fixed by the  sickness insurance society  to  which  the  worker belongs  according  to  (a)   the actual  earnings or (b) the mean of a scale of wages in which the member is  classified  or (c)  the collective agreement  rate for a class  of members or  (d)   the average daily wage for a class of members.    Different  societies may fix different basic wages for individual workers  in the  samewage class.   Increased contribu- tions   may   be   imposed   onemployers,  where the unemploy-ment  risk  is  appreciably abovethe avorage.   (ii)  The  total contribution isnow 17 per cent, as follows : Unemployment  insur-  ancehealth insuranceinvalidity insurance  ...
 8. Waiting period for  benefit.  The waiting period is one week of continuous unemployment.  Afresh waiting  period  must be served  if  there  has  been  an interval  of over  ten  weeks  be-tween two  periods of  unemploy-ment.4. Continuous  Unemployment.  The claimant must be unem-ployed at least  three days in sixconsecutive  days  in  order to qualify for benefit.      5. Rates of Benefit.(i) Ordinary benefit.  A flat rate of benefit is paid foreach of  the  following classes adult men, adult women,  youngmen,  young women, boys  and girls.  There is no differentiationaccording  to   wages when  inemployment.(ii) Transitional benefit.  The rate  is  the  same  as  for ordinary benefit.   There is nolest of means. 8. Waiting period for benefit.  The normal waiting period  is14  days for claimants withoutdependants  entitled to benefit,7 days for claimants with one,two or three dependants entitledto benefit, and 3 clays for  claim-ants with four or  more depen-dants entitled to benefit.   Theseperiods may, in certain circum-stances, be reduced to 7, 3 and 0days, respectively.  The waitingperiods may be served within,and remain valid for, a period  of six weeks.4. Continuous  Unemployment.  In Germany, benefit is paid foreach day of unemployment; butnot when casual days are lost bya worker in continuous employ-ment.    There  are,   however,special rules for casual workers and  short-time  workers.   (TheGerman comment on the Englishrule is that it must result in dis-ecouraging a  man  from takingemployment on the third day soas not to lose two days&apos; benefit.)      5. Rates of Benefit.(i) Ordinary benefit.  The rate of benefit is related  tothe wage class of the workerwhen in employment, both for ordinary benefit and emergencybenefit  (a  detailed account  isgiven in Appendix VI).  The scheme  was abused  by persons who took employment inthe town  and  returned  to thecountry to  draw   benefit.   as their rate of benefit was based onthe wage  class  to which theywere allocated in the town, thebenefit  drawn   was  ordinarilyhigher than the prevailing wageof country workers.  Such cases have  been  met   by  allocatingclaimants  who  return to  thecountry to a lower wage class anda lower rate of benefit.    Thedecision in these casos is made bythe  local  representative   bodyattached  to   the   competentExchange.(ii)  Emergency benefit.  The rate is lower in the highestwage  classes than for ordinarybenefit.  Emergency benefit  issaid  to be  &quot; 10  to 15  per cent.cheaper than&quot;  standard benefit.
  6. Qualifying Condition for            Benefit.(i) Ordinary  benefit.  A claimant  must  have  paidthirty  contributions  in the pre-ceding two years.  This does notnecessarily mean  30 weeks&apos; or180  days&apos;  employment.   Thecondition  is satisfied if a persondoes one  day&apos;s insurable  bondfide employment in each of thirtycalendar weeks.(ii) Transitional benefit.  Transitional benefit is paid toall classes of insured workers.  There are two conditions :   (a) 8 contributions in the pre-ceding two years or 30 contributions-tions at any time ; and  (b) that  the  claimant  is  nor-mally employed in an insurableoccupation,  and will  normallyseek to obtain his livelihood bymeans of insurable employment.  7.  Period for which benefit is           payable.(i) Ordinary benefit.  The maximum  amount  that can be drawn is 74 weeks&apos; benefit in two years (104 weeks, less 30).(ii) Transitional benefit.  There  is no  statutory  limitupon  the amount of transitional benefit that can be drawn by any individual  claimant   who  cansatisfy the modified contributionscondition.   The rate is  a maximum rate which may be reduced in accord-ance  with  a  strict mathematicalformula  if  the income of theclaimant   and  his  householdexceeds  a  certain   sum  after making various allowances.   0.  Qualifying Condition  for            Benefit.(i) Ordinary  benefit.   On a first claim,  the workermust  have worked 52  weeks (312working  days) in the  previoustwo years (three years in certain cases).  When  26 weeks&apos; benefithas  been  drawn  the  claimantmust  show on  any  subsequentclaim that  he  has  worked  26weeks in a year (three  years incertain cases).    The qualifyingcondition   is,  however,   morestrictly  drawn  for  persons  inwago  classes  VII to XI (validfrom  1.8.30 to 31.3.1931).(ii) Emergency benefit.  Emergency benefit is  paid toselected classes  of workers (seeAppendix VII).  On  a first claim,  the workermust  have  worked 13 weeks (78working  days)  in the  previoustwo years (three years in certain cases).  When 39 (or 52) weeks&apos;emergency   benefit   has  been drawn the  claimant must show,on any subsequent claim, that hehas worked 13 weeks in the pre-vious  year (three years in certain cases).  7.  Period for which benefit is           payable.(i) Ordinary benefit.  The  maximum  amount that can   be  drawn  is   twenty-six weeks&apos; benefit after  the comple-tion  of any qualifying period.(ii) Emergency benefit.  The  maximum  duration   ofemergency benefit is at present89 weeks, except in  the case  ofpersons over  40 years of age,who,  when the state of employ-ment justifies the extension, may receive  it for 52  weeks.   the duration of  emergency  benefitmay bo varied from time to time by order.
8. Definition of  an Tlncviployed            Person.  (i) The Unemployment Tnsur-ance Acts contain no definition ofan unemployed person, hut thereare two  provisions which relateto special circumstances in whiclia person cannot  be deemed to beunemployed.  (ii) The  first provision (1920Act, Section 7 (2) (a)) is that aperson cannot be deemed to beunemployed  on  any  day  onwhich he is following any occu-pation from  which  he  derivesremuneration or profit.    Thereis an exception to this rule which provides  that benefit  may  be payable if  (1)  the  occupationfrom which the claimant derivesremuneration  or  profit couldordinarily have been followed byhim in  addition to  his usualemployment  and  outside  theworking hours  of that  employ-ment, and  (2) the remunerationor  profit  derived  therefrom inrespect  of that  day does  notexceed 8/4(Z. on a daily  average.8. Definition of an Unemployed            Person.  (i) The German  definition ofan  &apos;&apos; unemployed  person &apos;&apos;  wasadded  to  the  Employment  Ex-changes   and   UnemploymentInsurance Act by the amendingAct of 12th October, 1929.  Itreads as follows :   &apos;&apos; An unemployed  person isone who  by occupation is accus-accustomed  to earn his living predominantly-nantly as an  employed person,but is temporarily  not in  an employment  relationship,   and cannot earn sufficient for his orher maintenance  by  means of&apos;independent work, especially by agricultural or industrial  workon his or  her own account, orcannot do so by carrying  on an existing  undertaking,   or  doesnot or cannot co-operate in theearning of a joint  livelihood inthe  undertaking   of  a   wife,husband, parents,  grand-parents,or descendants, provided that inthe circumstances  this can  be reasonably  expected   of   theparties concerned;  this shall inparticular  be assumed  if theparties concerned live  together in a common household.&quot;  (ii) The  necessity   for   this amendment arose  from the factthat, under the  original Act, itwas an easy matter for personswho were  not   in  any  senseemployed persons (e.g., indepen-dent   farmers,    inn-keepers,artisans,  shop-keepers  and their families)  to qualify for benefit by taking up  temporary  employ-ment.  Casual earnings, duringunemployment, from temporaryservices which are  not  liable to sickness insurance or from pettyemployments which are not liableto unemployment insurance orfrom independent work of similarscope,    affect   ordinary   and emergency benefit according to a formula  which is equivalent to increasing the full benefit by one-tenth  and  deducting  from thebenefit,  so increased,  one-halfthe  casual earnings.    Benefitpaid plus casual  earnings  mustnot, however, exceed one  and a half times the full benefit.  Casual earnings not  exceeding one-fifth  of the full benefit pay-able are disregarded.
  (iii)  The   second   provision,relating to the interpretation ofthe term &quot; unemployed person,&quot;is that a claimant is not  deemedto he unemployed  and qualified for  benefit during  a period forwhich  he  continues  to  receivewages  or  receives any payment by way of compensation for theloss of and substantially  equiva-lent to the remuneration whichhe  would have received if  theemployment had not terminated.   9. Employment  of short           duration.  (i) Under the provisions of theUnemployment Insurance  Acts,a  contribution  is  payable  inrespect  of employment  in  anycalendar week.   The  fact  that employment is of short durationor that the remuneration there-from is not appreciable does notrelieve  the  employer  or   the worker  of the  liability for  pay-ment.   (ii) Employment for a day orfor any part of a day renders aperson subject to disallowance ofbenefit in respect of that day onthe  ground  that   he  is   notunemployed.   An   unemployedperson  who takes  employment for one hour a day for six days aweek would not be  entitled to benefit  (unless  he  could showthat the occupation  could ordi-narily  have been   followed  inaddition to  his usual occupation and that the   amount  of   the remuneration is not  more than 1 per week).(iii) So, too,  in Germany.    9.  Employment  of  short           duration.   (i)  Petty     employment   a conception introduced into Ger- man  unemployment  insurance by  the  amending  Act of 12th October, 1929 is not  normally insurable  in  Germany.   Petty employment   is  defined  as  an employment   satisfying  one  or both of the following conditions :   (a) When it is an employment which, from the nature of things or  by the contract of employ- ment,  is usually restricted to not more  than   30*  hours   in   a calendar week;   (b) When it is an employment for which  the agreed or custo- mary remuneration is no higher than 10 BM. a week or  45 BM.+ a month.   (ii) Employments which fall within  this   definition  merely because a shorter working time is prescribed  by  law  or official Order, or because, owing to lack of work, the  normal hours are reduced  (short-time),   are  not petty  employments.    Employ - ment as an apprentice or learner is not a petty  employment.  (iii)  Although  petty  employ- ment  is  not  insurable,  the employer (but not the worker) must pay  unemployment  insur- ance contributions in respect of workers  &quot;pettily   employed.&quot; Such  petty   employment  doesnot,  however,  count  towards the qualification  for benefit,  even when, owing to a combination ofpetty employments, the  limits set out in  paragraph (i) (a) and (h)  above,  are exceeded.   * This limit, which was originally &quot; less than 24 hours,&quot;  was raised to&quot; not more than 30 hours &quot; by tho Emorgoncy Order of 26th July, 1930.   t Those limits were originally 8 and 35 RM. rospoctively, and wore raisodby tho Emergency Order quoted.    [21889]                                             D
  (iv)  A worker may be engagedin petty employment and still beregarded as unemployed; but the earnings from the petty employ-ment  of  unemployed workersentitled  to benefit  reduce  theamount  of benefit  (vide  para-graph  8 (ii)  above).    10.  Willingness to work.  The  only  effective  test  ofwillingness  to work in the caseof ordinary benefit is by an offer of employment.  Until  employersmake full use of the Exchanges,this test cannot be fully applied.  In the  case  of  transitionalhenefit  a  claimant  is  requiredto prove &apos;&apos; that he will  normallyseek to obtain his livelihood bymeans   of   insurable   employ-ment.&quot;  The  Insurance  Officer  may require a claimant to attend an approved course  of instructionas a condition for the receipt ofhenefit.   11. Definition  of suitable         employment.   (i)  The   British  Unemploy-ment  Insurance  Acts  do  notprofess to provide a complete test of  suitability  of  work.   Thequestion is for  decision by the-statutory   authorities  hregard to  all the circumstancesrelative to  each individual ease.    10.  Willingness to work.  The German Act requires  theclaimant  to  show that  he  is&quot;willing  to  work.&quot;   In inter-preting the Act, the final AppealsBoard (Umpire) has decided thatthe  only  practicable  test  isrefusal  of an offer  of employ-ment.    Indirect   evidence   ofunwillingness cannot  be takeninto account.  The German Exchanges have always been  regarded primarilyas  placing  agencies   and theyhave  developed  on those lines.Employers make  much more useof the&apos;Exchanges, and a much higher  proportion  of  vacanciesis filled  by  Exchanges than inGreat Britain.   In the  Berlinmetal trades, for example,  it isa condition of a joint agreement in  the   industry  to  use   theExchange for all vacancies.  Willingness to work may  alscbe  tested by the offer of relief work or of the  so-called  &apos;&apos; dutywork &apos;&apos;  (the latter is very seldomavailable); or by requiring  theclaimant  to  attend a  retrainingor  further training course.   The   only  other   provision which touches upon the genuine-ness  of  the claimant is  the definition of an &quot; unemployedworker&apos;&apos;   which  requires  theclaimant  to  show that he  is aperson who  &apos;&apos; is  accustomed to earn his  living  predominantlyas  an employed  person.&quot;   11. Definition of suitable&apos;         employment.  (i) There is no  definition  inthe Act of  suitable  employment;but a claimant may refuse work(i) for which the agreed or locallyprevailing rate is not offered, or(ii) which he cannot be expected totake having regard  to his formertraining, his  physical conditionor his future  prospects, or (hi)which  is available  owing to astrike or lock-out,  or (iv) which
  (ii) The Acts do, however, give some negative  guidance on  thequestion.    They define  threetypes  of  employment  which  aclaimant may  reject  as unsuit-able without being  disqualifiedfor benefit. These are (a) an offer of employment  in  a  situationvacant  in  consequence of  the stoppage of  work due to a trade dispute;  (b) an offer of employment inhis   usual  occupation   in  thedistrict in  which he  was  lastordinarily employed  at  a rate of wage lower,  or  on conditions  less favourable, than those  which he might  reasonably have  expectedto obtain having regard to thosewhich  he habitually obtained inhis   usual  occupation   in  thedistrict or  would have  obtainedhad  he  continued   to  be  so employed;  (c) an offer of employment inhis usual occupation in any otherdistrict on a rate of  wage  lower,or on  conditions less favourable than those generally observed inthat district by agreement be-tween  associations of employersand  of employees, or failing  anysuch  agreement  than  thosegenerally  recognised   by  goodemployers.  (iii)  The  Acts further provide that after  a reasonable intervalemployment  involving  a changeof occupation shall not be deemedto be unsuitable provided it is atstandard rates of wages and onstandard conditions.is   detrimental   to   health   ormorals, or  (v) which entails achange  of  dwelling  preventing the  proper  care  of his depen-dants.  (ii) After nine weeks or during a period of seasonal unemploy-ment,  a claimant cannot refusework on the grounds that it isunsuitable having regard to  histraining  and  former  employ-men ts, unless it can be shown tobe  detrimental  to  his  future prospects.    A  bricklayer,  forinstance,  during  a period   ofseasonal  unemployment,  couldnot,  without   disqualification,refuse  roadwork.   Suitable work at a lower wage than the claimantis accustomed to receive may notbe  refused,  provided that  the wage offered is the agreed or pre-vailing rate.[21889]i) 2&quot;
APPENDIX II.PERSONS TEMPORARILY  SUSPENDED  FROM WORK  AND               SHORT-TIME WORKERS.GREAT BRITAIN.GERMANY.   (1) In Great Britain a person who  is  temporarily  suspendedfrom his employment and expects to resume  work with the  sameemployer within a period of six weeks is  classified  for statisti-cal  purposes  as  &apos;&apos; temporarily stopped,&quot; together with personsworking short time.   (2) For purposes of unemploy-ment insurance, all unemployed persons are treated  alike:  andno difference  is made  in theapplication of  benefit conditionsbetween -  persons   who   are&quot;wholly unemployed&quot; and per-sons  who  have  not  terminatedtheir  employment   relationship with   a  particular   employer,except in  the  particular  case  ofcustomary   holidays.    Conse-quently, persons who are tempo-temporarily suspended from work andimort-time  workers may  qualify for  unemployment  benefit   inrespect of any days of unemploy-ment which come within the ruleregarding continuous unemploy-ment, i.e., three days&apos; unemploy-ment within a period of six con-consectutive days.  (8) A  person  who is working-short time must pay  the samecontribution as a regular worker.and in ordinary circumstances hewill  satisfy the First  StatutoryCondition and will be eligible for benefit  indefinitely.   Even  if-ordinary benefit is not payable,  (1)  A   person    temporarily stopped is ordinarily regarded asstill serving under an &apos;&apos; employ -ment  relationship&apos;&apos;  and is not entitled to benefit.   The Germanworker, therefore,  prefers to be dismissed rather  than  to  be&quot; temporarily stopped.&quot;  (2)  Only workers in industrial undertakings employing at leastten persons are admitted to short-time benefit under special rules,which are very  narrowly  drawn.Commercial,  agricultural   andtransport undertakings are exclu-ded.   Before short-time  unern-ployment  benefit  can be  drawn,the Employment Exchange mustbe  informed that  the  under-taking is working short time, anda claim  for short-time unemploy-ment  benefit made either by the employer or the works council (ifthere  is no works council, by oneof the  workers)   on behalf of individual workers.  The benefitmay be paid by the employer, themoney so paid being refunded bythe   Employment  Exchange.There is a  procedure for checkand control by  the employment exchange.  There is no proof  of  needfor  short-time   unemploymentbenefit;  but benefit is withheldif another gainful occupation is exercised, or if suitable employ-menfc  is  refused, on  the days when the worker is released fromthe  industrial  undertaking  inwhich he  or  she is  normallyemployed.   As  in  Great Britain,short  time is reckoned in wholedays lost, not in hours lost, i.e.,if only one hour a day is  workedthe remainder of that day cannotbe reckoned as short  time for thepurpose of short-time unemploy-ment  benefit.   (8)  The qualification for berie-Pt is  lwsed, in  princiole, on the days  of actual employment inrespect  of  which contributions have  been  paid.   Short-timebonefit  is paid, so Iouk as short time is  being worked, to workers who have  qualified for ordinary
lie   will   have   no  difficultyin  qualifying  for  transitional benefit.         Waiting Period.   (4) The eligibility for  benefit of a short-time worker in  respect of particular days of unemploy- ment depends upon the operation of the  waiting period and  the continuity   rules.   A  waiting period of six continuous days of unemployment  must  be  served by every  claimant  for benefit, and  a fresh waiting period must he served if there is an interval of more  than  ten weeks between two  periods  of unemployment. Thus, a person who  is  unem- ployed  one week  in  every  ten weeks, or any shorter period,  will qualify for every week of unem- ployment  after  the  first.   A short-time  worker  who  is  un- employed  every eleventh week will not be eligible for benefit, as that  week  will be  a  waiting period.   Days counting for benefit.   (5) The  term &quot;A continuous period  of  unemployment&apos;&apos;  is defined by the Act.   It consists of any three or more days of unemployment, whether consecutive- tive or not, within a period of  anysix consecutive days.   The effect of this definition is that a  person who  is unemployed for (i) one ortwo days within six consecutivedays  is not entitled to benefit; (ii) three days or more  within six consecutive days is entitled to three  or  more days&apos; benefit; (iii) six continuous days at inter-vals of not more than  ten weeksis entitled to six days&apos;  benefit.benefit.  It would not be possiblein Germany to qualify for benefit by working at least one day in26 (or 52) weeks.        Waiting Period.  (4) The   waiting  period  for short-time  benefit is  served bythe industrial undertaking, andnot by the persons employed init.  It consists in a loss of eightwhole days in consecutive calen-dar  weeks, at least  two  daysbeing  lost  in  each   of   thesecalendar weeks; or in the closing down of  the undertaking  for atleast two calendar weeks imme-diately preceding  the  introduc-tion  of short-time.  If  no short-time benefit is drawn over  threeweeks continuity  is broken, anda fresh waiting period must be served before  short-time benefit is  again  payable,  but  weeks inwhich two days are lost (and noshort-time benefit drawn) do notbreak the continuity.   Days counting  for benefit.   (5) (a) The calendar week.  If 8, 4 or 5  whole days are  lost in  a  calendar  week,  1,  2 or 8  days&apos;  short-time  unemploy- ment benefit is  paid to persons without dependants: up to 2, 2^- or 8^ days&apos; short-time unemploy- ment benefit is  paid to persons with two dependants; and up to 1\,  8  or 4 days&apos;  short-time unemployment benefit is paid to persons  with  three  or  more dependants.    No   short-time unemployment benefit is paid in respect of one or two days lost in a week.  (b) The double calendar week.  The double calendar week is a week of full-time or short-time (up to five days lost), followed by a week during which no work is done at all. Two whole  days  lost in a  double  calendar week  are reckoned as  one whole  day  lost in each week, i.e.. 6 or 7 days lost in the double  calendar week are equivalent to 8 days lost in each week, 8 or  9 to 4 and 10 or  11  to  5.    The   days  soreckoned  are treated,  for  thepurposes of short-time unemploy-ment benefit, in the same way asthe days lost  in a calendar week.
  The following tabie shows  theposition in Germany : The weekly short-time unemployment benefit may not                   exceed when the number of whole days lost is as shown		for a short-time worker 					without dependants	with 1 dependant	with 2 dependants	with 3 or more dependantsin a week	in a double week	the number of times the daily rate of ordinary unemployment insurance benefit, with de-pendants&apos; allowances, shown below			1 2 3 4 5	6to 7 ! 1 8to 9 i 2 10 toll! 3		1 2 3	1 to 2 2 to 24 3 to 3A	1 to 24 2 to 3 3 to 4 &apos;  Note. Where two limits are shown, e.g., 2 to 24, it means that the short-time worker may receive from 2 to 24 times the daily rate of benefit, with dependants&apos; allowance, of the wageclass  into which he falls for the purpose  of unemploymentinsurance benefit.       Rates of benefit.  (6) Benefit is payable to short-time workers  at the same dailyrate as to workers who are whollyunemployed Numbers in receipt of benefit.  (7) There  are  no   availablestatistics showing the number ofpersons working short-time andregistered    as    unemployed.Short-time workers are  classifiedwith  persons  suspended  from work and  expected to resumewith their employer within  six weeks.   The number  of such persons   (&apos;&apos; temporarily   stop-ped&quot;)   was  618,511   out   of1,966,075  registered as  unem-ployed on 15th September, 1980.       Rates  of benefit.  (6) Short-time  unemploymentbenefit is calculated on the dailyrate  of  ordinary  unemploymentbenefit,  with dependants&apos; allow-ances,  in  the  different  wageclasses,  i.e.,  a person in WageClass will with three dependantswho  had lost four days in a week(whether reckoned on the singleor the  double  calendar week)would receive  from two to three times the daily rate of unemploy-ment benefit in Wage Class YTII,for  a person with  three  depen-dants.   In addition, some partof the sickness insurance contri-bution of  the claimant  may  bepaid as  short-time benefit.  Wages  plus  short-time  un-employment   benefit   plus  any sum paid  in respect of  sicknessinsurance  contribution  may notexceed five-sixths  of full wages.No benefit  is paid if wages havenot  been reduced by short-time working. Numbers in receipt of benefit.  (7) At the end of June, 1930,when the total number of personsdrawing  ordinary  benefit  was1,468,888,  there were in addition98,416  persons drawing short-time benefit  of   whom  88,481received one  day&apos;s benefit  forthree days  lost in the  working week 28rd to 28th June inclusive.
      Industrial -practices.   (8) The fact that a worker whois unemployed  one or two daysonly, in a period of six consecutive-tive  days,  is  not  entitled  to benefit  whereas  unemploymentfor three days  qualifies him forthree days&apos; benefit has given risein some cases to the  practice in industries working below normalto  concentrate   production   in three days of the week or less.      Industrial practices.  (8) There is  not  nearly  thesame incentive to  adopt  this practice, and the opinion  of theFederal Ministry of Labour 18that  the  German  short-timebenefit  rules  have  not undulyfavoured  the   development  of short-time working.APPENDIX III.CASUAL WORKERS  AND  PART-TIME  WORKERS.GREAT BRITAIN.GERMANY.   (1) It is  not possible to sayexactly  how many persons are engaged on  a casual  basis  in industry,  but the total numberis probably  about 250,000  to800,000 of whom  approximately50 per cent, are employed in the dock, casual and harbour service.   (2) The   Unemployment   In-surance  Acts make  no specialbenefit   provision  for   personsworking  for  employers  on  acasual basis or subject to irregular-clarity of employment,  and  theposition  of  casual  workers  inregard to unemployment benefit is  similar to that of short-timeworkers  (Appendix II).   (8) A  casual  worker  who  is working at least one day a week is able to show 104 contributions in  two years and he  is fullyqualified for benefit in respect ofdays of unemployment under thepresent conditions of  the insur-ance  scheme.   In an extreme case  he  can draw  in  benefitnearly 300  days&apos;   benefit eachI    (1) No exact  figures for Ger-!  many  can  be  given.   In 1921I  and 1922, the number  of persons!  in &quot; unstable &apos;&apos; employment was!  estimated at about 250,000.   ItI  is not known how many persons,I  in  addition, were  employed  inI  &quot;petty   employment.&quot;    The!  problem is  said to be  mainly a1  dock labour problem.    (2) The   Act  provides that  casual (unstable) employment is  insurable only  in  so far  as the  Reichsanstalt  so   orders,  and  gives power to the Reichsanstalt  to regulate the  unemployment  insurance  of  casual   (unstable)  workers  in  a manner  differing  from the provisions of the Act.  Pending new regulations, which  are  at present in draft,  casual  (unstable)  workers  are  insured  under  obsolete  rules,  if they  register  at  the   Employment  Exchanges.   (8) Many casual  workers are  excluded from insurance  under  the definition of  &quot; petty employ -  ment&quot;   (vide paragraph 9   of  Appendix  I).    Other   casual  workers would find it difficult  to complete   the   much    stricter  qualifying period, which is calcu- lated on  days of actual employ- ment.    The  casual  workers&apos;
year without forfeiting his rightto ordinary  benefit  and withoutclaiming transitional benefit.  (4) The  seriousness  of  thecasual labour problem is most inevidence  in the case of the dockindustry.  It is estimated that inthe nine  years  1921-1929 inclu-sive,  workers in the docks have drawn   in    benefit    about 22,200.000 or about five times the total amount  paid in contri-butions   in  that  period.    ThePort Labour Inquiry Committeeis  now sitting under the  Chair-manship  of Sir Donald Maclean,and a common feature  of theevidence  is the  stress  laid byPort  registration  Committees,employers and Trade Unions, onthe degree of absenteeism amongregistered dock workers who, it issaid, so arrange their work as  toensure not less than three daysunemployment in a period of sixconsecutive days.   This is  par-ticularly  marked among  highly paid  piece workers who  earn  in three days or less what would amount  to  a  week&apos;s wage  inmany occupations,  and  amongthe most irregular workers in the docks who work for half  days.The recently published report  onCasual Labour on the Mersey-side also commented on the samefact.   (5) Apart   from   the   dockindustry, it  is not possible  toestimate the cost of casual labour to   the  Unemployment  Fund. There  may  be  a tendency  to engage  workers  on  a  casualbasis for one,  two  or three days a  week with  the  knowledge that benefit will  be paid for theother days.  (6)  Persons engaged  in  part-time occupations are in a similarposition to casual workers.  this group  includes,  for  example,girls,  shop-assistants  employedonly  on  one  or two  days  aweek ;  women  laundry-workers;restaurant    workers;     officecleaners.problem is said to be made easierowing to the fact that the greaterpart of the casual workers (apartfrom   dock   workers)   do  notregister for  purposes  of  insur-ance.  (4)  There is a special scheme in  force for  dock  workers inHamburg.  The dock worker hasan  employment  book,  and his employer for the first day of theweek pays the employer&apos;s contri-bution for the week.  Benefit  is drawn  according  to  rules re- .sembling  those  for  short-timeworkers, but, it  is  stated,  atsomewhat more favourable rates.Other  casual (unstable) workers who are not  excluded from insur-ance  must obtain a voucher fromtheir  employer  for  each  day&apos;work  done.   If they register forunemployment  insurance,  they themselves  pay   the   worker&apos;contribution.   The   employeescontribution is paid by the localauthorities  out of the rates.  (5)  No  such  tendency  wasremarked upon.  The deterrentsare much greater.  (6)  Persons engaged  in  part-time occupations would be to alarge   extent,   excluded   frominsurance by the definition  of&apos;&apos; petty   employment&apos;&apos;   (para-graph  9  of  Appendix I).  (7)  The  insurance  of casual(unstable) workers against unem-
l^oyrnent is a problem which isawaiting  solution  in Germany.The system at present in force issaid to  be much  too difficult  to administer.  Germany has recog-nised,    however,    that   some industries, e.g., dock labour, are dependent to a large extent uponcasual employment, and that thewages  in  those  industries arehigh  because  of  the conditionsof   their  employment.   TheGermans  accordingly  take theview that in an industry  such asport labour, payment of unem-ployment benefit is not necessaryin respect of all days of unem-ployment  when   employmentstands at a normal level, but thatwith  a  higher  percentage  ofunemployment,   a   point   isreached where relief of unemploy-ment is needed.   The  Adminis-trative Council of the Beichsan-stalt has for some time past been trying to find  a solution of thedifficulty, and  the  general  effectof the new regulations which areat present in draft will be thatcasual  workers  working  three days a week or more will receiveeither no benefit at all  or lessthan the full amount ordinarilypayable. It is proposed also thatdock labourers should be put in a lower class in the wage scale  onthe  ground that their  rate  of wage is  higher  than  that  of similar  classes  of   workers  inmore regular employment.APPENDIX IV.SEASONAL WORKERS.GREAT BRITAIN.   (1) It is  necessary  to  distin-guish  between  (a)  workers  inoccupations  which depend upona  seasonal  trade, e.g.,  herringfishing, and (b) workers in tradessubject  to seasonal fluctuations,e.g., building, ciothing, etc.  InGreat  Britain  it is  generally accepted that persons in group (b)should be covered by an  unem-ployment    insurance   scheme.The alleged  abuses are in respectof claims by  workers in group (a).[21899]GERMANY.  (1) Seasonal unemployment ismuch more serious in Germanythan in England, particularly inagriculture  and   the  buildingtrades,  and special measures tomeet  the  position for both the classes  of  workers referred toopposite   have   been  taken.Begulations  have  been  made from time to time regarding thepayment  of  benefit,   duringseasonal   unemployment,    in industries    and    occupationsscheduled  as subject to seasonalunemployment.                        E
  (2) By working an  average of15  weeks  a  year  a  seasonalworker  can  satisfy  the  FirstStatutory Condition, and so mayobtain benefit for 74 weeks intwo  years.   A  worker  who  is employed  for less than thirtyweeks in two years  must  showthat he is &quot; normally in insurableemployment &quot; in order to qualify for transitional benefit.  (3) Prior   to  the  1930  Actseasonal workers  in  group  (a)were  disallowed benefit in the&apos;&apos; off-season &apos;&apos;  on  the  groundthat they were  &apos;&apos; not genuinelyseeking work&apos;&apos; if they remained at home in a district where no work  was   available.   In theresult, they were paying contri-butions for  a few weeks in theyear  and drawing  benefit onlyin  respect  of   unemploymentoccurring  during  the  season.This gave rise to representationsthat  they  should  be  excludedfrom insurance, and  a provision was  made  in  the  1927  Actwhereby a seasonal worker couldapply   to   be   exempt  frominsurance.  This provision is stilloperative.    The  worker  mustshow that he is  employed in the seasonal occupation for 18  weeksor less in the course of the year.If a  certificate  of  exemption  is granted he  himself  is  excusedfrom the  payment of contribu-tions, but the employees contri-bution  is  payable.   Since the1930 Act the genuinely seeking work  condition  is  no  longerapplicable,  and persons who areavailable for  work in the off-season may  qualify for  benefit.Since  the  1980 Act  came intooperation there has been a large increase in the number of  appli-cations for  cancellation of certifi-cates of exemption  granted  toseasonal workers.  (2) A  seasonal  worker  canqualify for ordinary benefit underthe  same  rules  as  for  non-seasonal  workers.   A  seasonalworker in  a trade admitted toemergency benefit is not eligiblefor emergency benefit during the recognised  periods of  seasonalunemployment.    (8) In the first year of unem-  plojunent  insurance,   1927-28,  there was no special provision for  seasonal workers.   During  the  winter  the numbers rose to  a  remarkable height.  Special pro-  vision was made for the winter of  1928-29 ; a longer waiting period  (three or  four weeks;  in some  cases, two weeks)  was  imposed;i  the  duration of ordinary benefit  during  seasonal  unemployment  was reduced to six weeks: there-  after the rates of benefit in the  highest wage scales were reduced,  and 4/5ths of the cost of benefit  were  borne  by   the   Federal  Government and  l/5th only by  the  U.I. fund.   This plan failed.  In  the  third  winter,  1929-30,  a reduction of the rates  of benefit  fin  the  upper   wage   classes)  during  seasonal unemployment  was tried.   The device adopted  was  to   pay  the  rates  for  emergency  benefit  to  seasonal  workers,   thereby   effecting   a  reduction over the  eleven wage  classes of 10 to 15 per cent.  This  is the situation at present.  The  occupations held to be subject to  seasonal    unemployment   are  specified  in great detail in an  Order of the Reichsanstalt (dated  18th December,  1928).    Comparatively,    the  unem-  ployed  in seasonal trades  draw  much  more benefit  than  the  unemployed in other trades.  In  effect, the other trades subsidise  the  seasonal trades.  The prob-  lem  is  difficult  because  some  seasonal workers,  e.g., building  workers, are powerfully organised  and are opposed to any further  reduction of benefit.    Seasonal workers cannot apply  for  exemption, except under the  general rules  governing  exemp-  tion.  Benefit (at rates  reduced  in the upper  wage classes) are  paid in   Germany  to  herring  fishermen  during  seasonal un-  employment, provided  that they  are not share fishermen, and, as  such, non-insurable.
  (4) One  class  of  case  mostcriticised   is   that  of   thosedomestic  workers   in  seasideboarding  houses  and  hotelswho  are said   to  work  onlyduring   the   summer   season,and   to   claim  benefit   inthe winter.   The difference  be-tween  unemployment  in  thisparticular group,  in summer and winter, shows a seasonal fluctua-tion of  about  45,000.   such persons  were  previously  dis-allowed benefit &apos;&apos; not  genuinelyseeking work.&quot;   They may nowbe disqualified if  they refuse  an offer of employment  or if theyare  not  available   for   work.Employment in private domestic service may be offered to  themand refusal may result in the dis-allowance  of  benefit  for  six weeks.   After six weeks benefitmay be  again   payable  unlessanother  offer  is   made   andrefused.  An attempt is made to reducethe number of seasonal workersin receipt of  benefit by the pro-visions of  Article  90 (8),  which provides that, during a period ofseasonal  unemployment, an un-employed seasonal worker  maynot,  in general, refuse alterna-tive  work on  grounds otherwiseadmissible  under   the  GermanAct.  In times of acute unemploy-ment, however, this provision isof little practical value as regardsseasonal   workers  other  thanbuilding workers,  since the  latter are by their calling more adaptedthan other classes of workers forthe kind of work offered by reliefworks, and there would  be nolack  of building workers for reliefworks.  (4) Germany  has  the  sameproblem.   The Exchanges andlocal administrative bodies havethe power  to  exercise discretion in the payment of benefit  at a reduced rate in such cases.[21889]
MARRIED WOMEN.GREAT BRITAIN.	GERMANY.(1) A woman who voluntarily leaves her employment on marriage may be disqualified for six weeks from the date of leav-ing her employment. When that disqualification expires she is entitled to benefit so long as she can show that she is &quot; available for work.&quot; If she falls into the transitional class, she will only bJ able to remain qualified for benefit by showing some efforts to obtain insurable work.	(1) A similar disqualification of six weeks operates in Germany; but a married woman who volun-voluntarily leaves her employment would not necessarily receive benefit even after the expiry of six weeks. She may be dis-qualified under the definition of an unemployed worker (v. para-graph 8, Appendix I). The German law makes a distinction between a woman who normally works for a living (e.g., a textile workerl and a woman who does not.  (2)  When  a firm  does  notemploy  married women  and  a woman is dismissed on marriageshe  may   qualify  for  benefitimmediately.  (2)  So too in Germany, if the woman  is  not  disqualified on other  grounds,  e.g., as  &quot;notaccustomed  to  work  predominantly-nantly as an employed person.&quot;  (3) A woman who has been incontinuous   insurable   employ-ment for 30 weeks satisfies theFirst Statutory Condition and is thus  able  to  draw  benefit for74  weeks  at  15/-  per  week( 55  10s. Od.), even  though shemay have no intention of takingfurther   employment.    Whenordinary   benefit    expires  a married claimant may qualify fortransitional benefit  if  she  canshow that  she is  normally  ininsurable employment and will normally seek  her  livelihood bymeans of insurable employment.Many married  women who havedone  no work  for many  years have  not  been able to  satisfythis condition.  (4) About  one  half  of  the married women claiming benefitare  textile workers  and many ofthem are on short time.  A con-tribution is paid in respect of anyweek in which  there is one day&apos;semployment or more, and in con-sequence  married   women  on short time are  fully qualified for ordinary benefit so  far as  thecontributions  condition  is  con-cerned.  (5) A  flat rate  of benefit is paid to an unemployed womanwhether single  or married.  No    (3) If a woman  in  Germany  has satisfied  the qualifying con-  ditions. she may draw standard  benefit  for  26  w^eeks  and/or  emergency benefit for 39 weeks,  if belonging  to a class admitted:  to  emergency  benefit.   There-  after, she must re-qualify.  But  the  woman who is &apos;&apos; not aceus-  accustomed  to   earn  her   living  j)redominantly  as an  employed  person&apos;&apos; would be excluded from  benefit.    A  married   woman  who takes  up employment for a  short time only or  who has left  employment  in  order  to  get  married and  does not  intend to  return to  it would be disqualified.  (4)  In Germany, too, many ofthe insured women  are  textileworkers,  and,  in  the  textiletrades, short time is prevalent.But a married woman  on short time  and   qualified for  benefit would  draw  benefit  under  thetime given &quot;in Appendix  II.  (5) In Germany the income orbenefit of the husband may affectthe benefit  of  the  wife.   TheAPPENDIX V.
account is taken of the income )fher husband or of whether he ibhimself in receipt  of benefit.   Ita man  and  his wife have bothbeen  in insurable employmentthey may both claim benefit  atthe full rate when they  are botnunemployed; only one  of themcan claim benefit  for the samedependants.  (6) The only  real test of the availability for work of a married woman  is the  offer of  employ-ment.   Such employment  mustbe suitable within the meaning of the Act  as interpreted by theUmpire, or she is  entitled torefuse  it  on   the  grounds  ofunsuitability.  Employment  is  held to  beunsuitable,  for  example,  if  it involves residence  away  from home or if it involves travellinga  considerable  distance   from home, so that  she  is unable to look properly after her dependent children.  (7) It is,  of course, impracticable-cable in present  circumstances to  test the  availability  of  allmarried  women&quot; in  receipt  ofbenefit  by  offering  them  indi-individually suitable employment intheir    own    districts.     Forinstance,   suitable   alternative employment for  married women in textile  districts is practicallynon-existent at the present time.wife&apos;s benefit may be reduced bythe  amount   by   which   the husband&apos;s    income    exceeds35  BM. a  week, but  not if the wife has two or  more dependantsentitling  her  to   dependants&apos;allowances.   (This  rule appliesalso to  the case  of a husbandwhose wife has an  income.)  if both husband and wife are draw-ing benefit, and one of them isdrawing benefit in  wage classesVII to XI  (the highest classes),whichever benefit is the lower is reduced by half, but not if thereis  one or  more dependants inrespect  of  whom  dependants&apos;allowance is payable.  (6)  The conditions are similar in Germany; but, until recently,a married  woman  could refuseemployment and remain entitledto benefit on the grounds that theemployment,  although  within reasonable  reach  of her home,would prevent her from properlylooking after her children.  Thishas  now  been  altered by  anEmergency  Order,  which came into operation on the 1st August,1930, and the rule now runs thatshe can refuse employment only if it involves a change of dwellingwhich would prevent the propercare of her  children.  She isexpected   to   make   adequate provision for the care of depen-dents if she is to show that she is available for work.  (7)  So, too, in Germany.             General.    (8) In  the  German view  the danger of abuse lies in the fact that  a married  woman  is,  in general,  free  to   choose  both employment and unemployment.i She  can  always  rely on   her husband, and unemployment  has not the same cogency as it has onI e&amp;ber  workers.   For  instance,
she can endure a period of dis-qualification (e.g.,  for refusingemployment) without serious dis-comfort and without resort to the poor  Law.   The  Beich recognised -nised this, but  disliked takingdirect methods against  marriedwomen as a class.  Some urged the  total  exception  of  marriedwomen from insurance,  but thiswould  have  penalised  marriedwomen  in those  districts  andtrades in which  it was usual to employ married  women.  More-over, the rates of wages for men,as well as women, were in certain cases fixed  on  the  assumptionthat in most cases the wife would contribute to the family income.Consequently,     the    indirectmethods  explained above  were adopted as a middle way.  In theview of German officials the steps taken have gone a long way toprevent, the abuse.  It  should  be  added  that  a married  woman  who takes  upemployment for a short time onlymust pay a contribution while inemployment,  although,  whenunemployed,  she  may  be  dis-qualified  for  benefit  under the definition  of   an  unemployedworker.   Representations  havebeen  made   to  the  FederalMinister  of Labour that in suchcases the contribution should be refunded.  The financial positionprecludes the  possibility of  anysuch refund, but  the matter  is open to consideration later whenemployment improves.
      RATES  OF ORDINARY  BENEFIT  AND WAGES IN GERMANY.     1.  IN Germany, unemployment benefit  increases as the wage  increases  (subject  to an overriding  maximum in the highest wage  class): though the ratio of benefit  to wages decreases.  There are  eleven wage classes.  No distinction  of age  or sex is made for benefit  purposes within the same wage class.     2.  The  lowest rate of benefit is paid  to persons earning up  to  10 RM. a week (Wage Class I a class of mainly theoretical interest,  since, in general,  persons earning  10 RM. a week or less are not  insurable).  The rate of benefit paid in this class to a single person  with no dependants is 6 RM. a week or less.     8.  The  highest rate  of benefit  is paid to persons earning over  60 RM. when in  employment (Wage Class XI).   The maximum  benefit in this class is 87-80 RM.  a week (about 37s. 0d.), which  is paid to a  worker who has five or more  dependants (e.g., a man  with a wife and four children).   (In Great Britain,  the rate  of  benefit in this case,  irrespective of the earnings when in  employ-  ment, would be 34s. a week.)     4.  The  dependants&apos;  allowance  in Germany is 5 per cent,  of  the principal benefit for each dependant; but the maximum number  of  persons in  respect of whom dependants&apos; allowances are payable  varies from one in the lowest wage class to five in Wage Classes IV  to  XI.     5.  This  system  makes  it difficult  to  set  up  a   complete  comparison between the German and the British rates of benefit.  Further difficulties are created by the fact that wages are lower  in  Germany than in Great Britain,  and that,  in certain circumstances,  benefit in Germany may be reduced.     6.  In Germany, the  rates of benefit are also for the most part  lower than in  England;  but they  are higher  for single  persons,  without dependants,  in Wage Classes IX, X and  XI, and higher  for men with  three to six dependants (including a wife)  in Wage  Class  XI.   The result of  these  differences in the levels  of wages  and benefit  is  that,  in some  cases, the  German  rates of benefit  are higher proportionally to the wage than the British  rates  of  benefit, while, in other cases, they are lower.     7.  The rates of benefit in  Germany for a single person without  dependants range  from 75 per  cent, of a so-called unit  wage  in  Wage Class I to 85 per cent, of the  unit wage in the highest Wage  Classes VIII to XI.   For  persons  with  dependants, the rates  of  benefit range from 80 per cent,  of  the unit  ivage in Wage Classes  I and II to 60 per cent, of the unit tvage in Wage Classes VIII to XI.  These are the  maximum rates.  But, as  the unit wage on which  the benefit  is  calculated is the mean of a range of wages, the  actual proportion benefit  bears to wage varies  with the position  of  the wage in the range.     8.  Thus in Wage  Class VI, with  a unit wage of 38  RM. for  wages  ranging  from  over 80 RM.  to 86  RM.,  the  benefit  is  40 per cent,  of the unit wage for a  person without dependants and,  65 per cent,  of the  unit wage for a person  with five  or  more  dependants.   In Wage Class X, with a unit wage  of 57  RM. for  wages  ranging  from  over 54 RM.  to  60  RM.,  the  benefit  is  85 per cent,  of the unit wage for a  person without dependants and  60 per cent,  of the unit wage for a person  with five  or more
dependants.  The relationship  of  the minimum and  maximum benefit to these ranges of wages is shown in the following Table : 							Minimum weekly benefit			Maximum weekly benefit			(for persons with no dependants).			(for persons with five or more dependants).								Wage Class and Range of Weekly Wages.	Actual benefit.

But this consideration of the relationship of benefit to wagesis now, in many cases, of theoretical interest only, for the following reasons.   Until the  1st August,  1930,  the  assignment to  a wageclass for  the purpose of assessing the amount of benefit was basedon the average gross  weekly earnings  of  the  claimant during a prescribed period.  Contributions, however,  were levied on a basicwage  adopted  by  the sickness  insurance  society for  sicknessinsurance purposes, and it frequently happened that this basic wage,on which unemployment insurance  contributions  were paid,  waslower than the average gross weekly earnings on which unemploy-ment benefits were assessed, so that the claimant received benefit in a wage class higher than that on which he had paid contributions.To remedy  this defect in  the system, the Emergency Order  ofthe 26th July,  1930, prescribed  that, from the 1st  August, 1930,the basic wage adopted for  sickness insurance purposes shall  bethe deciding factor in assigning a claimant to a wage class for thepurpose of benefit, e.g., a claimant  whose average  weekly earningswere 55  BM., but who had been paying sickness and,  therefore,unemployment insurance contributions on only 50 BM., would draw the benefit for Wage Class IX instead of Wage Class X.   10.  In  Great  Britain,  there is no limit on  the number  ofchildren  in respect of whom a claimant may draw benefit, and aman with a large family and low wages would draw more  benefit,both relatively and absolutely, than  his German fellow.   11.  The average wages  of skilled,  semi-skilled  and unskilledmen in Great Britain are not known precisely: but it appears, from such information as is available  in  the Ministry of Labour,  thattheir average weekly wages in industries covered by the Unemploy-ment Insurance Acts  would lie  between 80s.  and  50s.  a week,assuming full employment  and  including  piece-work  as  well  as time-work earnings.   In Germany,  the  average wages of the sameclasses of workmen  would  lie between 70  and 40  BM. a week.On these wages the ratio of benefit to  wages in  both  countries isas follows: 
Great Britain.Weekly Wage.	Single Man.		Man and Wife.		Man, Wife and Two Children.		Man, Wife and Four Children.		Benefit.	Ratio.	1 Benefit.1 Ratio.		Benefit.	Ratio.	Benefit.

In  Great Britain health insurance benefit  is paid  at  a flat rate which is lower than the rate of unemployment benefit. InGermany  sickness  benefit is paid at rates which  vary between50  per  cent,  and  75 per cent, of the  basic wage.  There are more than 7,000 separate societies administering sickness  benefit and  the rates are not uniform.   In general, however, a man is better off when drawing sickness benefit than he is.when in  receiptof  unemployment  benefit.   This  partly  explains  the  highercontribution (7 per  cent, of basic wages) for sickness insurance.APPENDIX VII.     EMERGENCY BENEFIT AND THE MEANS TEST IN GERMANY.   1.  EMERGENCY benefit corresponds in principle  to transitional benefit in Great Britain.  It is a special form of benefit which maybe regarded as  midway between  ordinary benefit and poor relief,and which is granted to insured persons who have either exhaustedtheir claim to, or failed to qualify for, ordinary benefit,  and w7ho arein occupations admitted to emergency benefit.   2.  The relative  provision of  the Employment Exchanges and unemployment Insurance Act states that &apos;&apos; in times when the labour-market  is persistently and particularly unfavourable,  the FederalMinister of Labour, after hearing the Administrative Council of theReichsanstalt,  shall  authorise  the  granting  of unemploymentbenefit  as  emergency benefit  otherwise  than  as  provided  in sections 95  to  99  (qualification   for  and duration  of ordinarybenefit).   The authorisation may be restricted  to particular occupa-tions or districts.  The amount of  the benefit and period for whichit is granted may be reduced.&quot;   3.  At  present, emergency benefit is  granted for  a period of39 weeks,  with extension to 52 weeks for persons  over 40 yearsof age,  if the  state  of employment justifies this extension.  TheChairman of the Employment Exchange may reduce the period,if  there  is reason  to  presume that  the  unemployed  person can secure  suitable employment within a less period.   4.  Regulations have been issued from time to time, schedulingthe occupations and/or districts admitted to emergency  benefit.  Atpresent, the scope of the scheme is limited to the following insuredpersons.
  I. Workers  in  the following trades or occupations are directly        - admitted:       (a) glass industry;      (b) the working  up  of metals,  and the  manufacture  of  machines, instruments, and appliances (including watchmaking  and jewellery workers);      (c) leather and kindred trades;      (d) wood working, cabinet making, (wooden) musical instru-  ment making, brush, comb and basket making, etc.;      (e) clothing trade,  including boots and shoes;      (/) theatrical performers, including members  of choruses in  so  far as  the  latter  are  theatrical  performers, and  persons  engaged  in the making of cinematograph films;      (g) non-manual workers.  II. Workers  in the following  trades or occupations  may  be         admitted &quot;in  so   far  as  the  need  exists &quot;  by  the         Chairmen  of  the State  Employment Exchanges either         for the whole of the area under their jurisdiction or for         parts thereof :       (a) stone-working,  brick, tile and  pottery making,  in so far  as the workers  are not already admitted under I (a);      (b) textile industry;      (c) bookbinding,  cardboard box making and kindred trades;      (d) the food, and tobacco trades, excluding grain milling and  the drink trades;      (e) printing trades;      (/) artistic crafts;      (g) theatrical,  musical  and public  entertainments of  all  kinds, in so far as the persons concerned are not already admitted  under I  (/);      (h) skilled and semi-skilled factory workers who have  been  employed for at least a year in undertakings in which the bulk  of the workers have been engaged on work in the occupations  specified above under I (a)-(g) and  II (a)-(g)  as occupations  in respect of which emergency benefit  may be granted, who have  worked in such undertakings with the  persons belonging to those  occupational  groups, and, whom, in view  of  the employment  situation  and their  past occupational activity, it is  impossible  to place  in  other employment.  HI. Inclusion  of further  occupational groups by the Chairmen         of the State Employment Exchanges :       (i) the Chairmen of the State Employment Exchanges  may,  in  the case of  local  areas  under their jurisdiction in which the  population  does  not  exceed  50,000 persons,  admit further  occupational groups  if, as the  result  of  exceptional  occurrences  or  circumstances, severe and prolonged depression prevails in  the labour market;      (ii) the Chairmen  of the State  Employment Exchanges  are  -empowered to make  any necessary adjustments designed to take   account  of anomalies  arising out of  the arbitrary classification  of  workers under occupational  groups.  IV. Notwithstanding the fact  that the  occupational groups  to         which they belong may have been included among  those         in respect  of which emergency  benefit is payable,  the         following persons  are not entitled to receive  emergency         benefit:       (a) unemployed  persons under 21 years of age;      (b) unemployed  persons belonging to  occupations specified   in special regulations  as  being subject to seasonal unemploy-   ment, during  the recognised period of seasonal unemployment.   Stone masons  are excepted from this provision.   5.  The grant of emergency benefit  is  subject to  the  same general  conditions as ordinary benefit, e.g., the unemployed personmust   be  capable   of  work,  willing to   work,  involuntarilyunemployed, etc.
   6.  The qualifying period for emergency benefit is reduced to18 weeks&apos;  insurable employment within the periods specified for ordinary benefit (instead of 52 weeks&apos; insurable employment within two years which may be extended to three years on  a first claim for ordinary benefit, and 26 weeks&apos; insurable  employment within one year which may be extended to three years on a subsequentclaim for ordinary benefit).   7.  The waiting  period for emergency benefit is the same as for ordinary benefit, i.e.,  14, 7 or 3  days, according to the numberof dependants.  The period may be reduced, in  certain cases, to7, 8 or 0 days, respectively.   8.  The obligation  to perform duty work  (Pflichtarbeit) which applies, as  a condition for the receipt of ordinary benefit, to persons under 21 only, applies,  in principle,  to all claimants  for emergencybenefit.   9.  The rates of emergency benefit are the same  as the ratesof ordinary benefit in the lower wage classes, but they are reduced in the  higher  wage classes, as follows:    Persons in                Receive the Rates  Wage Classes                 of &quot;Wage Class  VI and VII                      VIVIII and IX                      VII   X and XI                     viii the highest rate  of  emergency  benefit is,  therefore,  27 RM.  aweek for a person  with  five  or more dependants,  instead  of87-80 RM.  a week ordinary benefit.    10.  These  rates of emergency benefit are,  however, maximumrates, and are  subject to proof of need.  Proof of need is decided by  a complicated arithmetical formula, in which two main factorsare brought into play : (1) the number of  relatives  living in theclaimanfs household,  i.e., the spouse, parents, grandparents anddescendants, as well  as brothers  and sisters, if  these  have nopersonal income, and (2) the income of the various members of the household.    11.   On the basis  of  the  number of relatives living in the household of the claimant  is built up  a kind of theoretical income(called the Freigrenze) in  accordance  with the following Table: Wage Class.	Unit Weekly Wage (RM.).	Freigrenze for Applicant (weekly).		Extension of Freigrenze for each Family Member.		Freigrenze for Applicant (weekly) in RM.				Percentage of Unit Wage.	RM.

It will be seen that the &quot;theoretical income&quot;  ofa claimant for emergency benefit  in Wage Class VIII  with  threefamily members is 54  RM.  a  week.
   12.  Tlie  actual  income  of  the  household,  including  theemergency benefit, is  then added up; but, in making this addition,the following items are left out of account:    (a) Benefit which  the unemployed person receives as the result          of his or her own thrift;   (b) Certain   social  allowances  and  benefits,   e.g.,   certain          payments under  the  accident insurance code, maternity          benefits, certain  poor law  grants,  especially maternity          grants, certain payments to disabled ex-servicemen, etc.;   (c) Half of the income which a family member derives from his          or her employment, to the extent that this half  income          exceeds the amount by which the Freigrenze is raised on          his or her account  (i.e., if the income from employment          is 40 BM. a week, and the Freigrenze is raised by  9 BM.,          the amount to be taken into account in the addition of          the family income is 40-(20-9) or 29 EM.).There are also rules under  which  various other  elements of  incomeare either taken into account or neglected.   For  instance,  thecasual earnings of the claimant (or of family members)  from petty,non-insurable  employment  during  the period  of  unemploymentare taken into  account in assessing the income of  the household,but not to the  full  extent of the  earnings.   13.  If the  actual income of the family (as assessed under therules) exceeds  the  &quot;  theoretical income,&quot;  the emergency  benefit is  reduced by  the amount  of the excess.  If,  however, the actualincome  (as assessed)  falls  below the  &quot;theoretical  income,&quot;  theemergency benefit is paid in full.  Examples of the  working of therules  are given  below : Example I.   Household   Membership. An  unemployed  person is  livingtogether with his father and brother in a common household.  Hehas a claim to  emergency  benefit in Wage Class VIII (unit wage45 BM.).   The  father is in receipt of a weekly wage  of 40 BM. andthe brother has  no income.                Free Limit  (Freigrenze).                                                     BM.60 per cent, of the unit wage for the claimant ...    ...    2720 per cent, of the unit wage for the father  ...    ...     920 per cent, of the unit wage for the brother  ...    ...     9      Increased free limit    ...     ...    ...    ...    45                           Income.   Of the father&apos;s wages the following is not taken  into account:50 per cent, of his income from his employment in  so far as this sum  ^20 BM.) exceeds  the  increased  free limit for the  father^9  BM.), i.e., 11 BM.                                                      BM.   To be  reckoned therefore are 40-11   ......    =29^00   and  claimants emergency  benefit      ...     ...    ^5-75         Total       ...............      44-75                            Result.   The emergency benefit will be payable in full since the income to be taken into account together with  the  emergency  benefit  is less than the increased free limit.Example II.   Household Membership. As  in  Example I,  but without thebrother.  The increased  free limit then  only amounts to 86 BM.The  emergency benefit in this case is reduced by 8-75  BM.  sincethe income of the household as reckoned (44-75 BM.) exceeds thefree limit (86  BM.) by 8-75 BM.
Example III.   Household Membership. The same unemployed person, but inthe same household are living:    The  father,  with a weekly income  from his own employment      of 60 EM.   The  mother  without personal  income.   A  brother,   with  a  weekly  income  from  his  employment      of 40 EM.   A sister, without personal income.                      Free Limit.

The income (54-75  EM.)  exceeds the increased free limit(54 EM.) by  0-75 EM.   The emergency benefit is reduced bythis sum.Example IV.   Household Membership. The same unemployed person, but inthe same household are living :    The wife without personal income..   A son with a weekly income of 40 EM. from his employment.   A  daughter with a monthly  pension under the War  Pensions       Act of  40  EM. composed of 15-20 EM.  principal pension       and 28-80  EM. supplementary pension.   A grandchild with an orphan&apos;s pension of 18-20 EM. per month,       of which  10  EM. are principal pension and  8-20 EM.       supplementary pension.

The  family  allowance   for the wife amounts  to ...     ...           ...    2*25The supplementary pension of the grandchild is left   out of account in reckoning her family allowance.   The  principal pension amounting to 10 RM. a   month, or 2-80&apos;RM. a week, is higher than the   family allowance of 2-25 RM., so that no family   allowance is  granted  for the grandchild.   The   daughters pension  is not taken  into account.   It could  only  be  deducted  from  her family   allowance,  which in this case is not granted.         The total sum taken into account amounts to   47-00                            Result.   Since the increased free  limit is  more than  the  income, theemergency benefit (15-75 plus 2-25 RM.) will be payable in full.Example V.   Household Membership. The  same unemployed  person, butin the  same  household are living  the  wife  and  two childrenwithout personal income.  The  man earns 8 RM.  on each of  three days in the  week,  or  24 RM., by temporary services, in  pettyemployment not liable  to sickness or unemployment insurance.

Half of this latter      amount, 9-75 RM., is deducted from the full      benefit of 22-50 RM.,. leaving  12-75 RM.  As      this latter sum  plus  the earnings  of 24 RM.,      i.e.,  36-75  RM.,  exceeds lj  times  the  full      benefit,  or  38-75 RM.,  by 8 RM., this latter      sum is deducted from the 12-75 RM., leaving      9-75  RM. as the benefit payable)    ......         Total   .........                            Result.   As  the income is less than  the increased free  limit,  theemergency  benefit (9-75  RM.) is payable in full.   27   54 RM.24 9-7588-75
COMPARATIVE STATBMBNT  OF MACHINERY FOR  DETERMINING  CLAIMS                          TO BHNBFIT.GREAT BRITAIN.GERMANY.  (1) All claims for benefit  are referred  in  the  first instance tothe  Local   Insurance  Officer,regarding the satisfaction of  thestatutory conditions   or  as  to possible disqualifications.  If theInsurance   Officer   is  of   theopinion that no ground  for dis-allowance   or   disqualificationarises he allows the claim.   Hehas  no  power  to  disallow  theclaim, and if he is not satisfied he must refer  the  matter for  con-sideration to the Local Court ofBeferees. (A different procedureexists  where  the  &apos;&apos; trade  dis-putes&quot;  disqualification  is   in doubt.)  (2) The Court of Beferees con-desists  of  an independent chair-man (who is usually a member ofthe  legal profession), a repre-sentative  of  employers  and arepresentative   of   employees.They have before them at  the hearing  case  papers on whichare recorded the  matter whichthe  Insurance   Officer  has  re-ferred to them for decision, rele-vant  particulars   as   to   theclaimant&apos;s   industrial   history and  status and  any  statementsrelevant  to the  point  at  issuemade by the claimant,  his lateemployer or the  Local InsuranceOfficer.     The   claimant   mayattend the hearing and  he  maybe  represented   by  his TradeUnion  Secretary  and   by  anyother person except  a  barristeror solicitor.  A record is enteredon   the   case   papers   of   theevidence taken  at the  Court ofthe Courfs decision  and of thegrounds on which the decision isbased.  (1) The    original   decisionrespecting  an  application  for benefit is given by the Chairmanof the  local  Employment  Ex-change,  an  appointed  salariedperson often with the status  ofa Federal  Civil Service  official.Against his decision the claimantmay  appeal  to  the DecisionsCommittee of the  employment exchange.   That body  is  con-stituted  similarly to a  BritishCourt of Beferees, except that itschairman,  instead  of being anindependent lawyer from outsidethe  Employment  Exchange,  isthe Chairman or Vice-Chairmanof   the   local    employment exchange.  (2) An   appeal  against  thedecision  of the  Decisions  Com-mittee  may   be  made   by theclaimant or by the Chairman  orby any assessor of the DecisionsCommittee  to   the  DecisionsChamber   (for   unemploymentinsurance)  of the (District) Supe-prior  Insurance Office (this is an institution  established under theSocial Insurance  Code  for thevarious forms of social insurance)if the Decisions Committee   (i) has altered the decision ofthe  Chairman of the Employ-ment Exchange, or  (ii) confirms that decision but does not confirm it unanimously,or  (iii) confirms    the   decisionunanimously,  but by a majority vote  authorises  an appeal onaccount  of   the  fundamental importance of the case.  An  appeal  to  the DecisionsChamber   against the  decisionrespecting  an  application  for emergency benefit is not admis-sible unless the Decisions  Com-mittee has failed to adopt its decision unanimously.
   (8) There  may be an  appeal from the decision of the Court ofBeferees to the final authority,the  Umpire,  in  the followingcircumstances :    (i) by the Insurance Officer inany case;   (iij by the claimants associa-tion  in  any  case,  if  he is  amember of  an  association  of work people:   (iii)  by the  claimant,  if  the finding of the Court of Refereeswas not unanimous;   (iv)  by the  claimant  if  theCourt   of  Referees  gave  himleave to appeal.   Where  doubt  arises  whetherthe    claimant    is    unem-ployed in consequence of  a stop-page  of work due to  a trade dispute the procedure is some-what  different.   In  such casesthe claim  is  forwarded   by  theLocal  Insurance Officer  to  theInsurance   Officer   at   Head-quarters, who decides whether toallow  or to disallow the  claim.Against this  decision there is  aright of appeal  to  the Court of referees and in the same circum-stances, as in other cases, to theUmpire.   (4) The   decision   of   theUmpire is final.  (5) The  Umpire is  appointedby  the  Crown   as   the  finalauthority for determining anyquestion arising   in  connection  The Decisions  Chamber  forunemployment insurance of  the superior Insurance Office is con-stituted    similarly   to    theDecisions Committee, the chair-man  being a  member  of  the superior Insurance Office.  (3) If,  where   an  appeal  ismade to  the Decisions Chamber,an interpretation of fundamental importance  must  be  obtainedupon any  legal  provision  con-cerning  which   the   DecisionsSenate for unemployment insur-ance  of  the  Federal InsuranceOffice has not yet given a deci-sion,  the  Decisions  Chambermay refer the case to the Deci-sions  Senate  of  the   FederalInsurance  Office  with  a  state-ment of the construction which itputs upon the law.  It is boundso to refer the case if the  FederalInsurance  Office  has given  adecision laying down  a principlerespecting  interpretation,  butthe Decisions Chamber wishes todissent from it.   (This DecisionsSenate  Spruchsenat  corres-ponds  to  the Umpire;  but  itdecides principles, not cases.)  (4) If the  Decisions  Senateapproves  the interpretation  ofthe law on  which the DecisionsChamber has based its decision,it confirms  the decision.   If itdoes not approve the  interpreta-tion,  it gives its verdict  on  thelegal  question,  and  refers  thecase  back   to   the   DecisionsChamber  for further  discussion and   decision.    The  DecisionsChamber  then gives  the finaldecision in  the case,  basing its decision on the  verdict on  thelegal question quashing its inter -pretation.  (5) The   Federal   InsuranceOffice  is   the  final   Court   ofAppeal  in  all types  of social insurance.   Its Decisions  Senate
with a claim to unemploymentbenefit.for  unemployment insurance iscomposed  of  five  persons,  a chairman, a permanent memberof the  Federal  Insurance  office or a member of  the central officeof the Beichsanstalt, an  addi-tional  judicial   officer  chosenfrom among  the  judges of  theLabour Courts,  and  one  repre-sentative  each  from employersand employees.
