REPORT.                                 PREFACE.    1.   WE  were instructed  by our terms of reference to undertake a  generalsurvey  of the various national insurance and pension schemes, and to consider thelarger policy of the Government thereon.  In pursuance of this task we have made ageneral survey of the existing schemes of social insurance, with particular referenceto their interrelation one with  another, to the allegations  of  inconsistencies andgaps in the provision made by them, and to the demands made  in various quarters for the extension of one or other of them to persons now outside their scope or theincrease of the. rates of benefit provided under them.  At the outset of our report we think it fair to draw the attention of our colleagues to the extreme difficulty, inpresent financial conditions, of contemplating any major addition to the liabilities of the Exchequer in regard to the social services.  At later stages of our report weindicate the seriousness of the additional burden  involved in some of the proposalsfor extension for which there is considerable demand among our  own supporters. Itseems to us  impossible at present to envisage any lightening of  the Exchequerburden by way of increased contributions from employers or  from employed or from both.  Th these circumstances we have found it necessary to  regard any majorextensions of existing schemes as outside practical politics  at the moment, and to concentrate our attention on plans for removing some inequalities and abnormalitiesin the working of the existing schemes, and for  certain  minor expansions and improvements which  it may be  considered possible to make, even in  the  existing financial stringency.   Where a scheme has seemed to us impossible of contemplationat present on the financial ground we have not thought it necessary to consider it inany detail, but have contented ourselves with a resume of its financial implications.    2.   We have thought it expedient to present a summary of the Report in Part Iwith references at the end of each paragraph to the fuller information contained inthe Report.   The detailed Report is contained in  Part II and is divided into sevenparts.  These are :          Chapter    I. Amalgamation.         Chapter   II. Differences  in the Social Insurance Schemes.         Chapter  III. Scope of the Schemes.         Chapter  IV. Disparities between Approved Societies.         Chapter   V Non-Contributory Old Age  Pensions.         Chapter  VI. Retirement Pensions and Increased Old Age Pensions.         Chapter VII.- Miscellaneous  Questions.                     PART I. SUMMARY  OF THE  REPORT.                          Chapter I.-Amalgamation.Unification  of  the  Schemes of  Health Insurance,  Unemployment  Insurance and        Contribxvtory Pensions.    3.  Unification would  mean either the abolition of the Approved Societies orthe  handing  over  of  the  administration  of Unemployment  Insurance  andContributory Pensions to the Approved Societies.   A  proposal to disestablish the approved Societies Avould create very grave difficulties for any Government, and itseems quite  impracticable,  even  if it were,  desirable, with the present composition of Parliament.  Alternatively,  the Approved Societies,  from the nature of theircomposition  and government, are quite unfitted to determine claims for unemploy-ment benefit and to administer the scheme  generally.      [22049]                                                       B 2
    4.  Further, the three schemes are similar only in that they give cash benefits.In other respects they are dissimilar. Health Insurance is also concerned with theprevention and cure of sickness; unemployment insurance is necessarily linked withthe problem of finding work for the unemployed and of fitting men for employment.We do not think amalgamation of the schemes is  desirable or practicable.                                     (See paragraphs 42 to 62 and Appendix I.)A  Joint Card for Health Insurance, Contributory Pensions and  Unemployment         Insurance.    5.  We have closely  examined four possible  methods by which a joint cardcould be issued and collected, but we are satisfied  that the most promising of theseproposals -would add materially to the administrative costs, would seriously affectthe prompt  payment of benefits, particularly  in the case of unemployment benefit,and would effect little saving to the employers.                                    (See  paragraphs 63 to 66 and Appendix II.)           Chapter II. Differences in the Social Insurance Schemes.Equalisation of  the Health Insurance and  Unemployment Insurance Benefits.    6.  It has  been argued at various  times  that  a  worker and his  dependantsrequire as  much  assistance  when  he  is incapacitated by  sickness  as whenunemployed but  in good health, and that accordingly the same measure of assistance should be  provided under both schemes.  If health insurance benefit were raised tothe full rates of  Unemployment benefit, with, as at present, a reduction to half-ratesafter  26 weeks  of incapacity, the extra cost,  for  men, would  be approximately 10 millions yearly.  If the full rates continued throughout incapacity, the increase for men would be about  16^- millions a year.   There would also be an unknownliability in  respect of  an increase in the number and duration of claims.   Therewould also be an increase in the cost of the benefits in  respect of  women, but it hasnot been thought necessary to obtain estimates of this further cost.  Apart from thequestion of  cost, there are other considerations detailed in Part II of  our report which, in  our opinion,  make it clear that the change is not desirable.                                   (See paragraphs 68 to 83 and Appendix III.)The Drop in Income of the Unemployed Married Man  at Age 65.    7.  A married man who is drawing unemployment benefit on reaching the ageof 65  experiences a sharp drop in income owing to the difference between the rate ofunemployment benefit and that of old age pension.  Before reaching 65 he receives26s. a week  unemployment benefit, representing  17s. for himself and 9s. dependants&apos;benefit in  respect of his wife.  On reaching 65 unemployment benefit ceases and isreplaced by old  age pension, which is at the rate of 10s. a week if and so long ashis wife is under 65.  We recommend that  in order to lessen the severity of the fallthe allowance of 9s. a week in respect of his wife should be continued for  a maximum period  of  six months  after  the unemployed  man  reaches  65,  provided that hecontinues  to satisfy the conditions for the  receipt of unemployment benefit and his wife  is under 65.    It is estimated that on the present rate of unemployment the cost of this proposal would be  100,000 a year.                                                      (See paragraphs 84 to 97.)The Pension Age for Women.    8.  An insured person  reaching 65 receives a contributory old age pension of10s. a week and his wife receives  the same amount when she is 65.   It has beensuggested that the pension to  the wife should be  paid at 60, if her insured husbandis over 65.  The cost of the proposal would  be initially   3,000,000 a year, increasingin ten years to well over  4,000,000.  If the proposal  were adopted there would be pressure  for  pensions  at 60  for  other classes  of the population.   We cannot recommend  the adoption of  this proposal primarily  on the ground of cost.                                                      (See paragraphs 88 to 92.)
                                                                                  9 Q Q                                                                                  U tJ 0     9.   It has been urged on many occasions that the pension age should be reduced, even to 55,  in  the case of  the unmarried insured women on the ground that  their employment becomes precarious long before the age of 65.  If the pension age for this class were reduced to  60, the initial cost would be nearly  2 millions,  and in ten years the annual cost would have risen to about  2^ millions.     10.   The reduction of the pension age to 60 for insured spinsters would almost necessarily mean the same reduction for insured married women.   The  additional eost of lowering the pension age for all  insured women from 65 to 60 is estimated to be about  3,000,000 at the outset, rising to about  4,000,000 in ten years&apos; time.     11.   We feel that there is a good case for reducing the pension age for insured spinsters, but we regret that, in all the circumstances, we cannot recommend that it should be done at the present time.                                                     (See paragraphs 88 to 93.) Differences in the Statutory Conditions.     12.   Some anomalies exist  owing to the different statutory conditions of the schemes,  but the number of cases arising is too small to justify changes which might disturb the financial equilibrium of the present systems.                                                    (See  paragraphs 98 to  104.)                     Chapter  III. Scope of the Schemes. Possible  Extensions.     13.   The  voluntary  scheme we recommend will meet the only general demand that exists for the extension of the schemes.  There have been representations  from certain groups of workers  that the remuneration limit  for  non-manual workers should be increased from  250 to  350 a year, but such extension is  not generally desired, and we do not recommend it.   We think that the great majority of private domestic servants would  oppose the extension to them of Unemployment Insurance, although  from the  standpoint  of transference of labour it  is  to be desired; the question  of the inclusion of agricultural  workers in that scheme is being examined by the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Agriculture.     14.   When the school  leaving age is raised to 15,  children over  that age will come within the Unemployment Insurance scheme.  We recommend that they should also be  brought  within the  Health  Insurance Scheme,  so that there may  be correspondence between the two schemes, although we consider that, as at present, full  health  insurance  benefits  should  not be  available  until thev reach the age of 18.                                                  (See paragraphs 105 to  110.) .4  Special Voluntary Scheme.     15.   Since the  Contributory Pensions Scheme began there has been a constant and growing demand from persons of small means, such as poorly paid ministers of religion,  small shopkeepers and tradesmen, the hawker,  the music teacher, the dressmaker  and others  who are not  compulsorily insured, that they  should  be permitted to become insured as voluntary contributors to secure old  age pensions and, in the case of married  men, pensions for their widows or old age pensions for themselves and  their wives.  It has been admitted on all sides that there is a gap in the present contributory scheme because of the exclusion of the person of small means not working for an  employer.  He is no better fitted than the wage-earner to make independent provision  for  his widow and against old age, but up to the present no general scheme  has been devised under  which he might be admitted  to the State scheme.    16.   We recommend that a special  voluntary scheme be introduced to enable uninsured persons with incomes under  400 a year  to become insured  for all the benefits of the  present Contributory Pensions Scheme, with an option,  also, to enter the Health Insurance Scheme.    17.   The weekly contributions of the scheme we submit are,  for pensions alone, Is. 3d. for a man and l\d. for a woman, in the case of entrants in the initial periodof two years after the scheme begins.  The maximum age for entry into the scheme
in the initial period is 55.  After the initial period the scheme would still be opento persons of the same class, provided they were under 40.   For these later entrantsthere are differing rates of contribution according to the age at entry, beginning at 12. 3d. for a man aged 20.  If the entrants desire also to become insured for healthinsurance purposes,  the normal health insurance contribution will also be payable,making in the case of initial entrants a total contribution of 2s. a week for a man and Is. 4c?. a week for a woman.     18.  In fixing these rates of contributions we have had two considerations inmind : (1) That they should not be more than the person of the particular class  can afford to pay; and (2) that substantially the same relative measure of State assistance should be made available to the initial entrants as was given to the initial entrantsunder the compulsory scheme.     19.  In order to obtain  estimates of the cost  of such a scheme, it  has been necessary to make assumptions as to the  number  who would enter it, and we have assumed that 800,000 men would choose  to enter it  in the initial period.   In  ourview this is a liberal estimate,  having regard to previous experience of similar offers.On this assumption, in the first few years  the contributions from the insured persons would exceed the expenditure, but ultimately the Exchequer would have to meet, inrespect of initial entrants alone,  an annual deficiency rising to between  3,500,000and   4,500,000.   These  figures  include  all liability in connection  with widows&apos;pensions and old age pensions, covering, as regards the latter, both 65-70 pensionsand over-70 pensions.  If  the Exchequer liability in respect of these initial entrantswere equalised over a period of 30  years, the State would have to find in each year from the commencement of the Scheme in respect of widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensionsand  pensions for persons between 65 and  70, a  combined sum of between  1,000,000and   1,250,000.   It should be made clear that this sum of between  1 million  and 1^  million does not include  the related additional  liability in respect of over-70pensions referred to above.  At its peak this charge  would approach  2  millions  ayear.     It has  not been possible  to  obtain any estimates as to the cost in  respect ofentrants after the initial period.                                  (See paragraphs 111 to 114 and Appendix IV.)             Chapter  IY. Disparities between Approved Societies.Partial Pooling of Valuation Surpluses of Approved Societies.    20.  The Eoyal Commission on Health Insurance recommended that this shouldbe done to  mitigate the inequalities  of benefit between Approved  Societies.  Thereis a very strong feeling against  partial pooling among all Approved Societies otherthan the Trade Union group.   We feel that the proposal could be carried throughonly by a Government  with a big majority and in its first year of office.  It wouldantagonize the great  mass of the Approved Societies;  it could not  be put intooperation before  1934; moreover, it  is doubtful whether  500,000 a year could be relied  on,  which sum  would  not  go  far towards removing  the  great disparitiesbetween  Societies.  We make below a recommendation  for a restoration of StateGrant moneys taken away by the Economy Act, the adoption  of which might help to lessen the  inequalities to Avhich we  here refer.                                   (See paragraphs 115 to 119 and Appendix V.)Restoration of Health Insrurance State Grant Moneys.    21.  It is necessary again to emphasise that the Committee has throughout been severely  handicapped  in its recommendations by  financial considerations.   It isimpossible  to resist the fear that the consequent somewhat meagre results from suchan exhaustive and long-promised survey as  the Committee has made of the  wholefield of National  Insurance will cause disappointment  in many  quarters.   It is,therefore,  desirable that all that  is possible should be  done  to satisfy legitimateexpectations, and it is  urged that the following proposal will help  materially in thisdirection and will do so at a minimum of cost.
    22.  It will be remembered that the Economy Act of 1926  reduced the StateGrant payable in  respect of  National Health  Insurance expenditure  from theuniform proportion of 2/9ths to l/7th for men and l/5th for women, and therebydeprived Approved Societies and their members of about  2,750,000 a year, the bulkof which would have been available in due course  for the provision of additional benefits.  It is not surprising that this has been the  cause of much discontent amongthe Societies, and the feeling of grievance has not diminished in recent years when,owing to the rising cost of sickness and disablement benefits, there is a  consequentprospect of diminishing surpluses out  of which additional  benefits  are provided.Many Societies, and particularly those of the Trade Union Group, are dissatisfiedbecause they cannot give any additional benefits to their members owing to heavy expenditure on  the ordinary benefits.  We suggest that if something is now done todeal with this long-standing grievance it should be of considerable help in satisfying the expectations which have been formed about the findings of this Committee.  Wetherefore recommend  that the  yearly  sums which  would be payable to approved societies by the Exchequer had not the State Grant been reduced by the EconomyAct of 1926 should again be made available for National Health Insurance purposes.We do  not,  however, propose that  the State  Grant  should be  restored to  theproportion  of  2/9ths  and the extra  moneys credited directly  to the approved societies in respect of their  benefit  expenditure.   We recognise that nothing lessthan this will satisfy.the general body of the Approved Societies; their plain demand is for the restoration of the  State Grant to  its original  proportion  to which theyclaim they  are entitled on contractual grounds.   We are, however, quite clear thatthe demand in this form should not be acceded to.  The effect of the restoration ofthe proportion of 2/9ths would still  more add to the  wealth of the  prosperousSocieties.   Thus,  if this course w^ere followed, the result would be to accentuate  theexisting disparities in surpluses, whereas it is  desirable that all reasonable steps should be taken to help in the direction of reducing these disparities.  Our specific recommendation is that the restored money should be pooled and earmarked for newtreatment benefits and possibly some of it used directly in helping Approved Societieswhich  cannot at  present give  any additional benefits.    We suggest  that if  the maternity scheme for insured persons which has already been before  the Cabinet is adopted, the Exchequer moneys required, about  1-J- million a year, should be treatedas definitely part of the restored moneys. The remaining yearly sum, representingroughly  1,250,000, might be used either for the provision of  a statutory  new benefit(possibly the provision of  a specialist medical service) for all insured  persons, ordirectly used to mitigate the inequalities between Approved  Societies by allocatingit between  those of them wdiich are at present unable to provide their members with additional  benefits.  The demand of this class of Societies is that  they should be  putin a position to pay for  dental treatment for their members.   There is  much to besaid for using the money in this wray, but it is not to be overlooked that it would be strongly opposed by the much larger group of Societies which claim the restorationof the State Grant moneys for  their own purposes.                                                   (See paragraphs  120 to 124.)               Chapter Y. Non-Contributory  Old Age Pensions.The  &quot; Means &quot; Limit.    23.   It has often been suggested that the &quot; means &quot; limit should be abolished and that all persons over  70  should  be entitled to 10s. a week irrespective of theirmeans and earnings.   The initial cost of this concession would be about  11,000,000,on the assumption that all eligible persons took the pensions.   The cost  of thisproposal is, in our view, prohibitive.   If the voluntary scheme we have recommendedis adopted, it will go far to meet the claim for the removal of the &apos;&apos; means &apos;&apos; limit;those AVIIO  enter  the scheme  will  qualify  for old age pension  by virtue of theirinsurance and the &quot;means&quot;  test will not be applied  to them.                                                  (See paragraphs 125 and 126.)    24.   It has been urged that the deduction of  39 a year, which is allowed inrespect of means  other than earnings in  arriving at the means of a person,  shouldalso  be  allowed in respect of earnings.   The cost of doing this  would be about l-i- million a year and accordingly we cannot recommend that it should be done.                                                   (See paragraphs  127 to 129.)
s     25.  There has been a suggestion that the  method of assessing  the value ofinvestments or property for the purposes of the  &quot; means &quot; limit should be altered.We consider that the present basis of assessment should remain.                                                           (See paragraph 130.)Continuance of the Double Pension for Insured Blind Persons.     26.  An insured blind person on reaching the age of 65  is eligible, subject tosatisfying the statutory conditions, for a contributory old age pension in addition tohis blind person&apos;s pension.   From age  65 to age 70  he  is thus in receipt of  1 aweek.  On reaching age 70, only one old  age pension of 10s. a week is payable to him.&quot;We recommend that the grievance caused by the  drop at age 70 from  1 a week to10s.  a week should be removed and that insured blind persons who are, in effect, inreceipt of a double pension of  1 a week between the age of 65 and 70 should continueto receive  the  double  pension for life.  This  recommendation should be read inconjunction with our comments on the &quot; definition of blindiiess &quot; made below.    27.  The cost at the outset of this proposal would be about  127,500 and wouldprobably reach an ultimate figure of  200,000 a rear.                                                    (See paragraphs 136 to 141.)Minimum Age for Blind Persons Pensions.    28.  Pensions to  blind  persons begin  at  age 50.   We  recommend that theminimum age for such persons should be reduced  to 40.  The cost of this concession would be  150,000 a year.  Here again  our  comments on the definition of blindnessare relevant.                                                 (See paragraphs 142 and 143.)The Definition of Blindness.    29.  It has come to our notice that the number of persons registered under the blind Persons Act is very rapidly increasing, and in view of the consequent increaseof the number of pensions which are granted to  the blind at age 50 we think thatthe responsible departments should carefully consider the suitability of the  presentdefinition of blindness which  constitutes the qualification for pension under the Act.The  number of persons between the ages of  50 and 70 in receipt of pensions on theground  of  blindness increased from 16,075 at  30th June, 1926,  to  23,042 at  30thSeptember, 1930.    It  is extremely improbable  that  the number of totally blind persons is increasing at the same rate and it suggests that the present definition isnot sufficiently  precise.                                                 (See paragraphs 144 and 145.)           Chapter VI. Retirement Pensions  and Increased  Pensions.Pensions at Aae 60.    30.  It is estimated on very speculative  assumptions as to the number of personswhom it would induce to retire, that a retirement pensions scheme giving pensions of 30s.  a week at 60 to a married couple and  1 a week  to  a single person and requiring pensioners to give up work permanently would cost in the first year about 21,600,000 if it applied to insured  persons  under the unemployment insurancescheme, including railwaymen, and  assuming that it  would be possible to exclude the important classes of agricultural workers and private domestic servants.  Afterten years the cost would have risen to  38,000,000.                                                    (See paragraphs 146 to 149.)     31.  The scheme of Retirement  Pensions referred to at the Labour Conferenceof 1930 has been interpreted  as contemplating a pension of 30s. to married men and20s. to single persons aged 60 and over engaged  in insurable occupations.  If personseligible for inclusion in the scheme were limited to those employed (or  available for employment) in the occupations covered by  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Actstogether with railwaymen and  workers  engaged in agriculture and private domestic service, the cost would be about  30,300,000 rising to about  50,000,000 in ten years&apos;time.  If, however,  a wider interpretation were adopted and persons insured underthe National Health Insurance Acts who were  permanently incapacitated  at the inception of the scheme and minor classes of insured persons such as outworkers were also  included, these figures would become  33,500,000 and  54,000,000 respectively.All these figures are  additional to the cost of existing pension schemes.     32.  A scheme of pensions at the same rates without any condition of retirementfrom work and applied to all persons insured for health  insurance would cost about
  75,000,000 in the first year.  This cost is additional to the cost of present pension commitments.  In ten years&apos; time the cost would have risen to about  95,000,000.     33.  If  the  present  contributory old  age  pensions  began  at  60 the initial expenditure, apart from  any consequential loss  of contributions, would be about  25,000,000.  In ten years&apos; time the additional cost would be about  30,000,000.     34.  The additional  cost of a scheme under  which unconditional  pensions of 30s. per week were granted  to married men and 20s. per week to unmarried persons aged 65 and over is estimated to be about  100,000,000, rising to about  130,000,000 in ten years&apos; time.     35.  Apart from other important considerations  the  cost involved in  any of these schemes makes it impossible for us to recommend that any one of them should be entertained.                                                    (See paragraphs 150 to 152.) Increase of the Rate of Old Age Pensions.     36.  If and when financial considerations become more favourable for a scheme of Retirement Pensions we feel it  would  be a  matter for careful consideration whether, taking everything into account, it would not be better to proceed by way of some general increase of old age pensions.   An increase of old age pensions would, to some extent, act as an inducement for an earlier withdrawal from work and it would be free from many of the difficulties  which are  inherent in the operation of any  plan of Retirement Pensions.     37.  If all old age pensions were increased to 15s.  a week the initial cost of the increase would be about  26 millions, and in ten  years the increase of cost would have risen to  about  35 millions.  The cost of this  increase rules out the proposal at the present time.     38.  Increase of the rate of old age pensions would undoubtedly lead to a demand that all widows&apos;  pensions should also be  increased  to 15s. a  week.   Even if this general demand (the concession of which would cost at once about  8 millions) could be resisted, it would be necessary at least to increase the pensions of widows between the ages of 65 and 70 to the same rate as is paid by way of old age pension to persons between the  same ages.  This increase would cost immediately about  If millions.                                                    (See paragraphs 153 to 159.)                    Chapter  YII. Miscellaneous Questions. Workmen&apos;s  Compensation.     39.  We  have  not  brought the administration of the scheme  of  Workmen&apos;s Compensation into our review as far-reaching proposals for reform submitted by a Joint Committee of the Trades Union Congress General Council, the Labour Party and  the Parliamentary  Labour Party,  are  at  present  being explored  by the Home Office.                                                  (See paragraphs 160 and 161.)Pensions Contributions for Serving Men of  the Forces.    40.  Under the Contributory Pensions Act the rate of contribution for men serving in the Forces is the same as that for  civilians.  If a serving man is killed ordies  as the result of his  service his widow  gets a service dependants pension, whichdebars her from the receipt of a contributory pension. On the other hand, the widowof a civilian who is killed at work is entitled to a  contributory pension  in additionto compensation under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.    This inequality of treatment has led to frequent protest on behalf of the men inthe Forces and, in view of the danger of reactions on War pensions to Widows fromthe grant of double pensions in  these cases, it has been proposed to reduce  weeklycontributions from 4\d.  to id., the reduction of &apos;\d. representing the actuarial valueof the rights withheld.  As a variant on this  proposal, the Service Departments have pressed for  the contributions  to be maintained at 4\d. and the extra  \d.  (repre-senting in the aggregate some  30,000 a year) accumulated in a special fund to beused for supplementary widows&apos; service  pensions.   The whole question should  beagain considered forthwith by the Departments concerned with a view to the removalof the present grievance.

                      PART II. THE REPORT IN  DETAIL.                          Chapter I. Amalgamation.    41.  A study of the historical development of the social services in this country will explain the financial and administrative independence of each other which is acharacteristic of the schemes  of  health insurance, unemployment  insurance andcontributory pensions insurance as they exist to-day. The schemes have not grownas part of a single and closely  co-ordinated system.   They  wrere  introduced  at intervals  to  provide  for  different  contingencies  of  particular   classes  of thepopulation, and different forms of administrative machinery appropriate in eachcase to the nature of the contingency to be provided against were set up.  The formof the health  insurance scheme  was largely  determined by  the  fact  that largenumbers of the population  were already members of voluntary organisations whichhad existed for many years for  the purpose of providing benefits of the same  natureas those proposed in the new national  scheme.  Each scheme,  different in its origins,has developed independently as a separate service, although the scheme of contribu-tory pensions is closely interlocked with National Health Insurance.  At first sight itseems indefensible that contingencies that seem to be of a like character should  beprovided for  by a collection of  more or less independent services, and our first taskwas to consider whether it  wTas  feasible, desirable and opportune  that these services should be  welded  into one comprehensive  scheme of  what  is popularly  called&quot; all-in &quot; insurance.Unification of the  Health Insurance, Unemployment Insurance and  Contributory         Pensions Schemes.    42.  We do not propose to give in this part of our Report a detailed statementof the  historical  development  of the Approved Society system  of the HealthInsurance  Scheme  and of the  financial  structures of the three social  insurance schemes of National Health,  Unemployment and  Contributory  Pensions.  Know-ledge of these matters is, however, vital to the proper appreciation of the problempresented by proposals for an  &quot;all-in&quot; insurance scheme.  Appendix  I  gives  ashort account of the three schemes, with  particular reference to questions relevant to amalgamation proposals.    43.  By the term &quot; unification,&apos;&apos; used in the heading of this section, Ave had inmind the setting up of a scheme with a common fund and one form of administra-tion  for all forms of cash benefits. We propose,  first, to deal with  the effects ofsuch a proposal on the Approved Societies.    44.  As is explained in Appendix I, each of the 7,000 odd Approved societies and branches is a self-governing institution and a separate and independent financialunit  controlling its  own funds.  It follows that unification would necessarily meanamalgamation of the  funds of Societies.   Undoubtedly, this  would be  resistedstrenuously by Societies of all types, and the practical operation of compelling  abouta thousand bodies* of trustees to  transfer their investments to the  State, with the inevitable charge of confiscation, would arouse much opposition.    45.   Notwithstanding that  the Trades Union Council- have recommended themerging of the various schemes, there is by no means unanimity of opinion amongthe different  trade unions which  are also Approved  Societies,  and, althoughnumerous resolutions  have been  passed  in  favour  of nationalisation  of  healthinsurance,  we understand from the Ministry of  Health that discussion with theTrade Union Officials has shown  that a number of them are not in favour of theabolition of the Approved Societies. Active opposition to unification would be met from all other groups of Approved Societies, comprising the Friendly Societies withbranches in  every  town  and  village,  Deposit  Societies,  Industrial AssuranceSocieties with their numerous agents, the rural societies formed for National HealthInsurance,  and the  Employers Provident Societies.   * In practice a Society with branches has only one body of Trustees for the whole of  its branches.      [22049]                                                        c 2
    46.  As unification would mean the supersession  of Approved Societies  asseparate financial units, it follows that it would be inadvisable to leave with them the power to admit claims for  benefit if they had no responsibility for the solvencyof  the fund.   It  would  be  administratively and  financially  indefensible  to contemplate a single fund being operated upon by independent bodies with differentstandards of administration freed from the responsibility for the consequences oftheir actions.  The present system under which each Society is a separate financialunit encourages good  administration and proper supervision of benefit claims, asefficient administration is reflected to  some extent in the surpluses out of whichadditional benefits can be given.  There would  be no  such incentive  under  acentralised scheme, and any slackening in supervision would inevitably lead to anincrease in the claims for benefit, thus creating a new and probably serious financialquestion.    47.  The sickness and disablement claims, taken over all, have now risen to theprovision made for them in the existing contributions in the  case of men, and to a level well above this provision  in the case of women.  The contributions, therefore,taken  as a whole, provide no margin for any additional  benefits, but it would beimpossible to discontinue either the cash additional benefits or the treatment benefits of this type  in the case of the great number of insured persons who are now enjoyingthem, while, as regards others who are less fortunate, it would be claimed that, undera scheme of an essential national  character, the cash benefits  must be uniform,  andthat a general and  generous provision of  Dental benefit  and other forms of&quot;treatment&quot;  allowances  must be made.   Since  the financial relief accruing fromamalgamation would be exhausted, so far as the contributions and the bulk of the funds  are concerned, with the pooling of the  claims  for sickness  and disablementbenefit  at the normal  rate,  the additional cash benefits and  the eagerly  soughttreatment benefits could only come  from extra contributions after the very short timein which the present surpluses would  be absorbed,  unless the Government wereprenared to put the whole of the burden of such benefits on the Exchequer, at a  costexceeding  12,000,000 a year.    48.  It  is  difficult  to  see  what  part   Approved Societies, as  at  present constituted, could usefully take in a unified scheme;  it may be suggested that theycould remain as paying agencies without administrative or financial responsibility,but even this is very doubtful, regard being had to the expensiveness of using the societies for this purpose only.    49.  Further, millions of insured persons  who are insured, both independentsand under the State scheme, in the same body, whether a trade union or a friendlysociety, receive their benefits under both plans at the same time and from the handsof the  same  official.  If the approved societies were abolished, these members would presumably continue to receive their &quot; independent &quot; benefits in the same way as they now receive their joint benefits, but their State benefit would be paid from anothersource, and in all probability would have to be fetched  rather than be conveyed tothem as at present.  The effect would thus be to  duplicate one important Service tothe insured  which is at present unified.    50.   It is shown  in Appendix I that the total  administration expenditure ofall three schemes is about 11 per cent, of the contribution income.   All administra-tion expenditure,  save that of the  scheme of National Health Insurance, is, whethercentral or  local,  controlled by a Central Department.  The utmost  economy  is exercised in the whole of this field of State activity.    51.   It is problematical whether in the long run any saving could be effected inthe cost of administering National Health Insurance by disestablishing the approved societies. Fewer persons,  devoting their whole time to the work, might certainly beemployed, but if  these were to enjoy (as they would certainly claim) the status, ratesof pay and  superannuation rights of civil servants or established employees of localauthorities, the total cost might well exceed the  sum paid to the approved societies.There is also the certainty that any savings on administration would be outweighed by the increased cost of  benefits  resulting from the loss of the approved societies&apos;interest in  an economical expenditure  and from the absence of the personal touchbetween the officials of the societies and their members which, undoubtedly, many ofthese officials possess.
    46.

The effect would thus be to duplicate one important Service tothe insured which is at present unified.    50.  It is shown in Appendix I  that the total administration expenditure ofall three schemes is about 11 per cent, of the contribution income.   All administra-tion expenditure, save that of the scheme of National Health Insurance, is, whethercentral or local,  controlled by a  Central Department.    The utmost  economy is exercised in  the whole of this  field of State activity.    51.  It is problematical whether in the long run any saving could be effected inthe cost of administering National Health Insurance by disestablishing the approved societies. Fewer persons,  devoting their whole time to the work, might certainly beemployed, but if these were to enjoy (as they would certainly claim)  the status, ratesof pay and superannuation rights of civil servants or established employees of localauthorities, the total cost might well exceed the sum paid to the approved societies.There is also the certainty that any savings on administration would be outweighed by the increased cost of benefits resulting from the loss of the approved societies&quot;interest in an economical expenditure and from the absence of the personal touchbetween the officials of the societies and their members which, undoubtedly, many ofthese  officials possess.
    52.   Under the Health Insurance Act each Society must include in its rules aprovision requiring that members in receipt of benefit shall conform to certain rulesas to behaviour during sickness,  and enforcement of these rules is  carried out bymeans of sick visitors.  The work is at present being done to some  extent throughthe voluntary services of  members, particularly in the case of  Trade Unions and friendly Societies, and it would require a large number of officials to replace thesevoluntary and part-time  workers.    53.   It should be added, as one of the practical difficulties of any developmentinvolving  the  abolition of approved societies, that many  thousands of  the  officialswould be  dispossessed of their  remuneration in respect  of their work under theNational Health Insurance  Scheme, and they include not only officials and clerkswholly engaged in health insurance work, but the part-time officials of the friendly societies and  Trade Unions and  the agents of  the industrial assurance companies.If compensation were offered in order  to allay the discontent created by the super-session of those at  present doing the  work,  a  substantial addition to  the  presentexpenditure might be  involved.    54.   If it is not practicable  to disestablish the Approved Societies&quot;, the only alternative seems to be, if amalgamation is to be effected, for the Approved Societiesto administer Unemployment Insurance.  It would  only be practicable for localbodies to undertake the administration of unemployment insurance if they had adirect financial responsibility, and the inevitable result of entrusting the approved societies which have no such responsibility with the task of testing the validity of claims for unemployment benefit would be an increase in the amount of benefit paid.It is essential, moreover,  that the same authority  should  be responsible  for findingwork for  applicants and  for paying unemployment benefit where work  cannot befound.   Clearly, the  great majority  of the Societies,  consisting  as  they do of individuals drawn from a variety of industries, and many with a widely scatteredmembership, would be wholly unable to establish the requisite machinery for dealingwith the problem of finding work in every industry represented among their members.    55.   The view that the social insurance services should be combined in a com-prehensive  scheme  probably arises from the  narrow  conception  of   the  healthinsurance and unemployment insurance services as schemes for providing merely forthe payment  of cash benefits  to insured persons when  unable to work throughsickness or unemployment.  They are more than this.  The health insurance schemeprovides for the prevention and  cure of sickness, as well as for monetary  reliefduring incapacity for work, and  it seems essential that  it should be administered by a Department which is concerned with the general health of  the  community and works in close association with the medical and dental professions.  The unemploy-ment insurance scheme, on the other hand, provides for  the assistance of workerstemporarily unemployed,  and proper administration requires that the  payment ofbenefit should be controlled by the Department whose primary concern is to find workfor the unemployed.    56.   It might be suggested that a single department should be set up for thecollection of contributions and the payment of cash benefits to workers either sick orunemployed.  It would be difficult, if  not impracticable,  to divorce  medical benefit from the  cash benefits, as these benefits are dependent on the.  medical certificatesobtained in support of the claims, and as already indicated  it would be impracticable to detach the payment of unemployment benefit from the &quot; placing &quot; work.  A single department of such limited outlook would, in fact, add one more separate departmentto the existing two.    57.   It has been  suggested in an earlier paragraph that  increased  expenditureon benefits would result if the Societies no longer  had a direct financial interest inefficient supervision.  The need  for close attention to guard against the danger ofincreasing unnecessary claims, coupleal  with a progressive slackening  of the standardof medical certification, has been emphasised recently in the report  by  the Govern-ment Actuary on the Sickness and Disablement Experience of a Group of approved societies.   From the point of view of benefit supervision,  no suitable form ofadministration alternative  to  the  present  system  has  been  suggested.    Localauthorities have been mentioned, but it is  difficult to see how these  bodies could be vested with the distribution of benefits unless they Avere charged with responsibilitytor the financial results of their administration.
     58.   It  is necessary to mention one other  aspect of the question which has apolitical bearing of some consequence.  The Approved Societies fulfil an importantintermediary function.   They are under the control of their members and administertheir own funds, and in doing this they act as most effective buffers between theGovernment  and the 16,000,000 insured persons.  Satisfactory machinery exists forthe settlement of disputes, and there is little discontent over the  administration ofhealth insurance benefits, although it involves many delicate and  difficult questionsof fact and law.  The position would be likely to be far otherwise if the State took a direct part in administration.     59.   As  regards  the  method  of  administration  of  pensions  under  the contributory Pensions Act, the close interlocking of the scheme with that of healthinsurance  ensures the  collection  of contributions,  and the records of individualinsured persons are obtained from the Approved Societies  when a claim for pensionarises.   The pensions  are  of a  different nature  from  Health  Insurance and unemployment Insurance benefits which are to meet temporary needs so long only asincapacity or unemployment continues.  Once title to pension  has been established,there is a continuing title to payment which is  determined only by death or, in thecase of a  widow by remarriage, and, apart from the certificates&apos; which pensionersare required to complete at regular intervals,  notifications are received from the registrar-General of changes affecting persons who are possibly pensioners.  Thereis, therefore, no need for the local  supervision of pensioners, and the system is essentially one  for central administration.    60.   We have  given careful  and   close  examination&apos; to the  possibility  of amalgamation of the social insurance schemes, for we cannot ignore the widely-heldbelief that the  present social  services can and should be &quot;rationalized.&quot;  We aresatisfied that unification on the lines we have explored in the preceding paragraphsis impracticable and undesirable.   It is recognised that developments in the dutiesof local authorities  in  relation to public health will enable at  some future  datecertain extensions of a medical  nature, and  medical  benefit under the healthinsurance scheme to be undertaken by these bodies, but  apart from this there is no case for any  fundamental changes in the present methods of administration of theschemes.    61.   The President of the Board of Trade has adumbrated proposals for  anall-embracing scheme of insurance,  and  we give below the summary of his  scheme as it was  submitted to us :          &quot;1. We have a great net-work of insurance schemes or kindred provision.    There are  the old  age pensions  Acts, widows&apos; and  orphans&apos; pensions Acts,    national health, unemployment and other insurance,  workmen&apos;s compensation,    many other schemes, together with a great range cf industrial assurance run by    large insurance organisations.         &quot;2. Some of these funds,  as in national health insurance, are relatively    strong;  others, like  the unemployment insurance fund, are heavily in debt.  It    might be entirely to the national advantage to link them all up together, if that    were  possible, particularly in bringing the  strength of one to the assistance of     another.         &quot;3. While many millions of people are covered by these schemes,  millions    remain outside.   Allinvolve considerable administrative staffs.  The conditions    of benefit  vary very much.   Many  risks,  e.g., displacement in  schemes  of    industrial  rationalization, remain uncovered.   In short,  there is a good deal    of overlapping and  a certain amount of confusion.         &quot;4. A year or two ago the &apos; Economist&apos; had two articles  on the Prudential    Insurance  Company.  In substance these articles suggested that it was now in    reality a great public utility organisation; that much of the profit was returned    to policy holders in increased insurance; that a substantial amount was set aside    for improving conditions of staff, canvassers and others; and that the amount    going to the shareholders on the subscribed  capital was relatively small.  These    articles concluded that in practice this form of insurance, so far as this company    was concerned, had  been virtually nationalised.         &quot;5. Of course, these articles may have been inspired; but they appear to    contain the principle which the Government might  consider.   Is it possible to
approach the large insurance organisations, get a summary of their  aggregatecapital, other resources, membership and relevant detail; put alongside with asummary of the schemes in which the State, Approved Societies and individualsare interested, as  given above; and consider together whether any  public corporation or public utility organisation could be formed which would cover thewhole field  of popular insurance in Great Britain, and make certain that allclasses of the community &quot;were included, providing at the same time for the mostdirect and businesslike management of the service which could be worked out.    &quot; 6. Having regard to the enormous financial burdens of the State I believe this investigation to be well worth while.   Further, it might remove this problem from the field of party politics,  in which all sections tend to bid against one another in benefits for the purpose of obtaining votes.   I recognise that it raisesa large question of principle, or of policy; and that it would properly be resisted by our movement unless  we made it perfectly clear from the outset that what we intended was public corporation or public utility.  As policy is involved  theCabinet might have to express a preliminary view.   I  am well aware t.&apos;,at  theMinister of Health and probably many others consider this plan to be  quite impracticable.  On investigation that might prove to be the case; but we havenot yet  investigated the matter writh the large insurance organisations; and Iam satisfied that that course would be well worth wrhile.&quot;    62.  Any proposal for reducing the cost of what may be regarded as essentialsocial services, by &quot; rationalisation &quot; or otherwise, is deserving of the most carefulconsideration, but we feel that the particular proposal which  the President of theBoard of Trade submits goes considerably beyond the scope of the matters which havebeen entrusted to us under our  present reference.   The &quot;nationalisation&quot; of thesystem of Industrial Assurance, which is  one of  its most important elements, hasoften been advocated as an item of Labour policy and must be seriously examinedwhen the time is opportune.   We have elsewdiere in this report set out some of thedifficulties of combining the  various schemes  of  State  Insurance  in  a singleorganisation, and while we refrain from investigating the subject of the nationali-sation of industrial assurance on its merits  w*e feel that we should set out some of thequestions which would  arise if, following a decision to take this system over, it weredesired to amalgamate it with the present schemes of State Insurance in a PublicUtility Undertaking such as the President has in view.  So far as UnemploymentInsurance is concerned a condition precedent to action of the kind would obviously be that the Fund should be so nearly solvent as to enable it to bring into the &apos;&apos; pool&apos;&apos;an amount of assets reasonably related to its liabilities.  Apart from this importantfinancial  consideration the  relation of the  new  Corporation to the EmploymentExchanges would require careful thought, for it must still be regarded as axiomaticto the  permanent success  of the  administration of a  scheme of unemploymentinsurance that the body which pays the benefit must be able to assist the workless intheir primary need of finding suitable employment.  So far as Health  Insurance isconcerned it is conceivable, perhaps, that if the system were wholly administered bythe Insurance Companies it  could be  transferred  to a Public Utility  Corporationidentified in its scope with the other activities of  the Companies.  This, however, isnot the case.  The majority of the insured men  and a substantial number of the insured women receive  their Health Insurance benefits through friendly societies andtrade unions,  or through approved societies connected with organisations of  this class.  Any such transfer as the President envisages would be strongly resisted incases such as these.  Nor would a Public  Utility Corporation, whose business wasinsurance, properly cover its field if it included the commercial companies and theState-created  schemes  but left out the great mass of sickness and other  forms of insurance administered on a mutual basis by the net-work of voluntary institutionsby which the  land is covered.   It  is  probable that the President contemplates theinclusion of these  institutions in the scheme, but it would certainly be found thatfriendly societies and trade unions were, to put it at the lowest, as little willing to surrender the voluntary thrift movement to a  Public Utility  Undertaking as theywould  be to relinquish  the share which has been given to them in the administrationof National Health Insurance.   It is evident to us, moreover, that serious difficulties would  be encountered  in bringing under  a common  control systems of insurancemaintained by voluntary contributions collected in various ways and by compulsorycontributions paid in a&apos; prescribed manner under statutory directions.  Finally, itmust be expected  that serious difficulty would arise in  determining the relationsbetween the medical profession and the suggested Public  Utility Undertaking, to
which the doctors in the National Health Insurance service would presumably  beanswerable in so far as their remuneration was derived from funds administered  bythe Undertaking.A  Joint Card  for Health Insurance, Contributory Pensions  and Unemployment         Insurance.    63.   The demand for  a  joint contribution card for all three social insurance schemes  instead of the present  two cards is  part of the suggestion  for a  unifiedsystem of  insurance whereby one body  would  collect  contributions  and pay thebenefits, all of the moneys being in one fund.  We have, however, thought it desirableto have  the question thoroughly investigated, to see if apart from a unified system a  joint card could usefully be introduced.   Appendix II contains an account of the detailed enquiries which have been made.    64.   The only possible scheme of those examined seems to us to be the proposalfor a joint half-yearly card, to which on  one part of the card health  and pensionscontribution stamps would be affixed, and on the other  part of the card unemploy-ment insurance contributions.  This scheme, however, is not satisfactory.  Firstly,it would mean  two unemployment insurance cards in a year instead of one, with a consequent doubling of the work of issue, despatch and collection.  The work Avouldhave to  be done by Approved Societies, and it would prove difficult to ensure that employers received new books for stamping immediately after the  beginning of the contribution half-year.   Unemployment books cannot, like health insurance cards,be obtained through the Post Offices.  Secondly, it is necessary that the Ministry ofLabour  should  be in a position  to certify a claim for unemployment  benefit whicharises immediately after  the  end of a contribution half-year; if the cards  were collected by the Approved Societies the Ministry of Labour would not be in a positionto do this.  Thirdly, great  importance  is attached at the  present time  to the classification of workers for the purposes of the industrial analyses and for a properappreciation of the  employment position  in this  country.  If the  cards were  to beissued through Approved Societies,  great difficulties would be found  in compilingstatistics.    65.   We are satisfied that the adoption of a joint card would  add considerably to administrative costs, which  would be out of all proportion to any saving to employers.  The objections heavily  outweigh  the only  advantage  of  the scheme tothe employer, which is that he would have only one card instead  of  two. to whichhe would have to affix the two stamps.    66.   We have come to the conclusion that unless  the schemes of health insurance and unemployment insurance can be amalgamated, it is not possible to have a  jointcard.            Chapter II. Differences in the Social Insurance  Schemes.     67.   It is not surprising to find in schemes of independent growth differences in rates of benefits,  conditions  for benefit and  methods of administration.   In thefollowing paragraphs we draw  attention  to some of the more important differences between the schemes, and examine in some detail the  considerations underlying these differences.Equalization of Benefits.     68.   Under the Health Insurance Scheme the standard weekly rate of sickness benefit is 15s. for an insured man and 12s. for an insured woman.   For disablementbenefit (which is paid after sickness benefit has continued for 26 weeks) the standard rate is 7s. %d. a week for both men and women.     69.   Under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme the weekly rate of unemploy-ment benefit for a man between the  ages of 21 and 65 is 17s.,  while, in addition, he receives in respect of his wife 9s., and in respect of each child under  14, 2s.   For a woman between the ages of 21 and 65 the rate is 15s. a week.   As regards  persons under the age of 21, the rates of benefit are lower.
    70.  There is thus a disparity between the standard rates of  sickness benefit and of unemployment benefit, and  at first sight  it is difficult to defend a position under which State schemes of  social insurance provide less  assistance to a workerwhen incapacitated by sickness than when unemployed but in  good health.   Further,under the  Unemployment Insurance  Scheme, the  standard rates of benefit  aresupplemented by allowances for wives and children, but there are no such allowancesunder Health insurance.   In considering the possibility of increasing the healthinsurance benefits, either by raising the standard  rates or by  supplementing them byallowances   for  dependants,  it  is necessary  to have  regard to the  following considerations :      71.  The rate of contribution is considerably lower under the Health InsuranceScheme than under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, viz., Qcl. a week, as againstIs. 3d. in the case of men.    72.   Whereas unemployment benefit is the  only  benefit to which an  insured person is entitled under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, insured persons underthe Health  Insurance Scheme are  entitled, not  only  to  sickness and  disablementbenefit, but  also  to medical benefit, maternity benefit,  and in the case of about three-quarters  of the total  insured population  to  valuable additional treatmentbenefits.    73.   Moreover,  the  standard  rates of  sickness and disablement  benefits  are increased, in the case of a large majority of insured persons, by way of additionalbenefit, the  average gross rate over the whole of the  insured  population being atpresent about 18s. a week for men and 14s. for women.    74.   Although the health insurance rates of  benefit are subject to reduction forarrears of contributions,  no such reduction is made in respect of  arrears  due to sickness or genuine unemployment.    75.   Side by side with  the  State  scheme of insurance  against sickness thereexists widespread provision  for  private or voluntary insurance through friendly societies, Trade Unions or other provident organisations, so that  it is very frequentlythe case that an insured worker,  when sick, receives benefit from some other sourceas well as from his State insurance.    76.   It  was deliberately decided when the Flealth Insurance -scheme was firstintroduced, that the rates  of benefit should not be made sufficient to cover the wholeneeds  of the  Avorker when sick, but should be merely an assured minimum which couldbe supplemented as necessary by private insurance or in other ways.  Hitherto this principle has  been  retained  by  successive GoA^emments,   AArho have  thought it undesirable  to amend the  scheme  in such a Avay as would be  likely to prejudice the voluntary thrift movement.  There  can be no doubt that any  substantial increase inthe rate of sickness benefit Avould have this effect and it would  meet Avith considerable opposition and  particularly amongst the old and poAverful Friendly Societies.    77.   The proportion of the insured population which is  sick at  any one time is considerably over and subject to far less variation than the  proportion which isunemployed.  As a consequence, unemployment presents a far more serious problemboth to the individual and to his dependants than  is ordinarily presented by sickness and calls for remedial measures beyond those required to meet the reasonable needsof a national scheme of sickness insurance.    78.   In the last  few years  there has been a somewhat alarming increase in theexpenditure  on sickness and disablement benefits and  determined efforts are being-made  to keep such expenditure Avithin bounds by careful administration at every point  in order to prevent any benefit being paid to persons not entitled to it.  Fromthis point of view the present Avould not be the most opportune  for any increase ofthe rates of  benefit.    79.   The burden of providing allowances for wives and children of sick members would not fall equally on all Approved Societies nor would it be proportionate to theexpenditure  of each Society on sickness and disablement benefits.    In national health Insurance each Society and Branch is a separate financial unit,  and  the      [22049]                                                          D
provision of allowances of this kind would present problems which do not arise inthe case of Unemployment Insurance, where there is a single fund for the wholeinsured populations.  In  the case,  for example, of Societies of miners, where theproportion of married men and the  relative number of children are invariably abovethe general average, the provision would involve a very considerable addition to thepresent liabilities.  Some scheme of reinsurance wrould therefore probably have to beadopted, unless the whole  of the new liability were assumed by the Exchequer.    80.  The question of  rates of sickness benefit under State schemes of insurancewas considered by  the International  Labour Conference on  Sickness Insurance atGeneva in 1927.   The Conference was much impressed by the explanation which wasgiven of the present flat rates under the British scheme, and in this connection thefollowing extract from the recommendations adopted by the Conference is of interest.        &apos;&apos; In order to secure that an insured person who is rendered incapable of    work  by sickness may recover  his health as early  as possible the  cash benefit    representing compensation for lost wages should be adequate.        &quot; For this purpose the statutory scale of benefit should ordinarily be fixed in    relation to the normal wage which is taken into account for the  purposes of    compulsory  insurance, and should be a substantial proportion of such wage,    regard being had to family responsibilities; but in countries where the workers    have  adequate facilities of which they are accustomed  to take advantage to    procure for themselves  additional benefit by  other means, a uniform scale of    benefit may be appropriate.&quot;    81.  A &quot;Note by the Government Actuary on the Financial Effect of raising the Sickness Benefit under National  tlealth Insurance  to the  Rates of Unemploy-ment  Insurance &quot; is attached as Appendix 111.    82.  In our view  the reasons  set out  above, apart  from the  cost,  make  itinexpedient that the cash benefits of health insurance and unemployment insurance should be  equalized.  The cost  of such a proposal would be very heavy and it seemsto us that, at the present juncture, it is impossible to contemplate any increase inthe contributions of employers  or workers; the whole burden of any increases would fall on the Exchequer.    Any  increase in the health insurance benefits would alsoresult in an incalculable  further liability  in respect of increased claims for benefitboth as regards number and duration.    83.  We  are  satisfied  that  ample facilities  exist for  supplementing healthinsurance benefits by voluntary insurance  through Friendly Societies and TradeUnions and that this form of insurance should  not be discouraged.The Change from Benefit  to Pension at Age 65 and the Pension Age for Women.    84.   Prior  to 2nd  January, 1928, when old age pensions at age 65 began to bepaid  under the  Contributory Pensions Act  of 1925, health  insurance  contributions and sickness and disablement  benefits ceased when the insured person reached the age of 70 and unemployment benefits and  contributions ceased when he was granted an old age pension at age 70 or after under the non-contributory Old Age Pensions Acts.  As from  2nd January,  1928, sickness and disablement benefits and unemploy- ment benefit ceased at age 65, and  the insured person, on reaching that age, was no longer required to pay any contribution on account of health insurance and unemploy- ment insurance.   As a result  of the cessation  of  sickness  and disablement benefit and unemployment benefit at age 65, persons who are sick or unemployed on reaching that age may suffer a loss of income by reason of the fact that the rate of sickness or unemployment benefit to  which they were entitled is greater than  the rate of old age pension.     85.   In making a  comparison  between  the rate of old age pension and the rate of sickness and unemployment benefit, it is  to be remembered that sickness benefit is replaced by disablement benefit after 26 weeks, the standard rate&apos;of which is 7s. Qd. a week and unemployment benefit  continues only so long as the unemployed person is fit to work and can be expected normally to obtain his  livelihood  by  means of insurable work.  It was estimated when the Act of 1925 was passed that the pension between the ages of 65 and 70 was worth over three times the contingent sickness and ^employment benefits which it replaced.  The  contributory old age pension is paid
for life whether the insured person is at work or not, is sick or well, and the rate ofpension is unaffected by earnings or savings.  When the wife of a pensioner is 65 shealso receives 10s. a week for life.    86.  Undoubtedly, however, the insured person who was receiving unemploy-inent benefit immediately before reaching the age of 65 feels he has a real grievancewhen, on his reaching that age, unemployment benefit ceases  and is replaced by anold age pension at a lower rate.  An unemployed  married man  receives unemploy-ment benefit at the rate of 26s. a week, but at age  65 this is replaced by an old age pension of only 10s. a week if his wife is under 65.  The fact  that before 1926 therewas no age limit for the receipt of unemployment  benefit may add to the feeling of grievance, particularly as some of the aged among the insured persons  preferred to rely on wages and unemployment benefit rather than take the old age pension.    87.   We have looked carefully into the question  as to the possibility of meetingthe hardship where unemployment benefit at 26s.  a  week drops  to old age pension of 10s. a week at age 65, by making some supplementary payment so long as the wifeis under 65 and the husband continues  to be unemployed.  The problem, how*ever, isnot one which stands alone, and the possible reactions are formidable.    88.   It would be difficult  to justify a pensions allowance in  resjDect of a young-wife (who may be working), and equally it  would be inequitable in a  contributory pensions  scheme to give an allowance in respect of some wives above a certain agewhile  excluding others.  There have been representations from time to  time that anold age pension should be  paid to the wife between  60 and 65 of a pensioner over 65whether he was unemployed or not, and we have examined the desirability of thisproposal.   The  initial cost of such  additional  pensions is estimated  at about 3 millions a year, increasing in ten years to well  over  4 millions.  But the grantof a pension to wives at age 60 would lead  inevitably to  an  insistent demand thatthe pension age for  unmarried insured women should also be reduced to 60.  Thedemand has already been  put  forward on many occasions that the pension age forsuch women should be reduced, even  to 55, and in  many cases it  would be said thatafter  the  age of 60 is reached the  economic condition  of the  elderly spinster isprecarious, and the  physical condition of many of  them unequal to the strain of regular work, even where it is available.  The cost of reducing  the pension age to60 for this class would approach  2 millions a year at the outset, and in ten years itwould  have risen  to about  2^ millions.  Even nowr the story is not  ended.  Thegrant of  a  pension  at 60 to  the  wives of pensioners and  to  insured unmarriedwomen would leave the insured wives between 60 and  65 of uninsured men or ofinsured men under 65, without pensions until they reach 65, or, in the case of thesecond class,  if the wife is younger than her insured husband, until he reaches 65.The contributions  for women  are at  a  uniform rate, and it would be impossible tojustify differential benefit  rates for women  according  as they were married orunmarried.  The reduction of  the pension age for spinsters to 60 would, therefore,almost necessarily  mean the same reduction for the insured married woman.  Apartfrom  the  argument  that  for  the same contributions the same  benefits  should begiven,  there  would be raised  the case of  the married  woman  who,  having  beendeserted  by her husband,  is at best in  no better case than the spinster;  if she haschildren to support her case is obviously worse. There is, too, the married womanwho is the main support of an invalid husband.  She is more deserving&apos;  of sympathythan the independent  spinster. The cost of  giving this further class of insuredwomen pensions at 60 would  be initially  600,000  a year, rising  in  ten years toabout  1,000,000.    89.  Taking these  three  classes together,  the cost in the first year would beabout  5-^- millions, rising after ten years to about  7-J- millions.    90.  Concessions for  the.  reduction of  the pension age under the  contributoryscheme would probably have reactions on the non-contributory pensions system, forwhich  the qualifying age is 70.  If the lot of  the employed woman with that ofcertain women whose  husbands are insured  is to  be. improved,  the  case of theuninsured women, such as the elderly spinster  or the widow  of  the uninsured maneking out a  precarious existence  by casual jobs  of dressmaking, for an earlierpension age than 70 would be very earnestly pressed upon the Government.  There is      I 22049]                                                      D  2
also the case of the  wife between 65  and  70  of the man over 70  who is notinsured and who is drawing an old age pension  subject to the  means test.  By-lowering the age from  70 to 65 for these classes a further expenditure of  4 millions would be incurred in the first year.     91.  The combined cost of the original suggestion  and its probable sequelae is thus, at the outset,  not far short of  10 millions, and after ten years approaching 13 millions.     92.  We cannot recommend the grant of old age pension at age 60 to the wivesof men in  receipt of 65-70 pensions as the cost is prohibitive.   Apart from the repercussions of such  a  proposal, the  cost would be  very  heavy having regard tothe  necessities of  the  class as a whole.  Further, there are other  classes of thepopulation whose needs  are greater.  It should also  be borne  in mind that if thepresent contributory principle of the permanent contributory pensions scheme is tobe preserved, any increase in the normal classes of beneficiaries would require some increase of the contributions.     93.  As regards the separate   question of reducing the pension age for allinsured women from 65  to 60,  it is estimated that the  cost of this proposal alone would be about   3,000,000 at the outset, rising to about  4,000,000  in ten years&apos;time.  As indicated above, there is much to be said in  favour of  the reduction ofthe pension age  for  insured spinsters, but we find ourselves in all the circumstancesunable to recommend that the proposal should be entertained at the  present time.     94.  We feel, however, that some exceptional provision should  be made to cover the specific  case of the married  man drawing unemployment  benefit who reachesage  65 and  has a wife under that age.  It has been suggested that  at least the severity of the fall in income from 26s. a week to 10s. a week should  be lessened bythe continuance for  a limited period after the unemployed husband reaches 65 of the dependants payment payable up to age 65 as part of unemployment benefit inrespect of his wife.  This dependants allowance is at the rate of 9s. a week.  Thesuggestion  is that  it  should be  paid  to men insured  under  the UnemploymentInsurance Acts who were unemployed and in receipt of benefit on attaining the ageof  65.  The  payment of  this dependants  benefit  would  continue  during  theunemployment of the husband  for  a maximum period  of  six  months if the  wiferemained under the age of 65 and if  he  satisfied  the  requisite conditions  forunemployment benefit.   We recommend that this proposal  be adopted.     95.  As regards the cost of the proposal, we are  informed that the number ofinsured men  attaining the  age  of 65 each year who are married to wTives youngerthan themselves is between 30,000 and 35,000.  The present rate of unemployment among men  is  about  18  per  cent.  The  rate for men  aged  65  is, however,substantially higher than this figure, and, allowing for  this, it is thought that thecost of the proposed concession at the present time might be about   100,000 a year.     96.  The concession would not entirely remove the grievance;  it  would onlypostpone the date of the final fall to the maximum of 10s. a week.  Doubtless at theexpiration of the six months&apos; benefit there would be a demand for its continuanceon the part of men who had not found employment and whose wives were still underage  65, and their  plea would have to be resisted  on the ground  that this was a concession to mitigate  the  present immediate fall in income from 26s. to 10s.,  andto enable them to adapt themselves  to the new conditions.     97.  It  is  necessary  to consider under what scheme the  money  for  this concession should be provided.   It could be argued that as this payment is in respectof unemployment the dependants benefit should be paid out of the UnemploymentInsurance Fund. Unemployment benefit ceases at age 65, however, and it has beensuggested  that  it would be contrary to the present  principles of the unemploymentbenefit scheme for a dependants benefit to be paid  in respect of an insured person who is no longer entitled to benefit under that scheme.  Unemployment contributions,however, are paid by employers in  respect of persons who are employed after theage of 65, and it has been suggested that the allowances might be paid from the fund which receives  those contributions.
 Differences in the Statutory Conditions.     98.   Under  the health insurance,  contributory pensions  and unemployment benefit schemes certain statutory conditions relating to duration of insurance and the payment of contributions have to be satisfied by a claimant before he has title to benefit or pension.  Under the health  insurance scheme,  title  to  cash benefits cannot arise until the insured person has been insured for a minimum  period and a minimum number of contributions  has been  paid,  while the rate of benefit  in a particular year depends upon the number of  contributions paid or excused in the previous year.  Statutory tests of a similar nature,  but not parallel in all respects, are required to be satisfied before  there is title to pension under the contributory pensions scheme.   The  normal statutory  insurance condition  for  the  receipt of unemployment benefit is, broadly, the payment of a minimum number of contribu- tions in the two years preceding the date of the claim for benefit. There is thus not one set of insurance  tests common to all the schemes.     99.  It is provided that a person cannot  receive concurrently health insurance and  unemployment benefits and these benefits cease before old age pensions begin, but,  as  a result of  the different insurance tests, it may occasionally happen, for example, that a worker becomes unemployed and, satisfying the statutory conditions for unemployment insurance benefit, draws unemployment benefit; on falling sick and  therefore ceasing to be available for employment, he is no longer qualified for unemployment  benefit,  but  he  may be unable  to satisfy  the health  insurance conditions for benefit, so that he is left without any cash benefit although remaining out of work.    100.  Further, a person receiving either health insurance benefit or unemploy- ment benefit, on reaching 65, normally will receive an old age pension,  but it may happen,  in the exceptional case, that he cannot satisfy the different conditions for old age pension, and is, therefore, left at 65 with nothing in place of the benefit he was formerly receiving.    101.  We are satisfied from a close examination of the question that the number of cases in which an insured  person  finds himself  disentitled to sickness  benefit although prior to falling sick he was drawing unemployment benefit is inconsiderable. Further, the finance of the health insurance scheme is a very delicate and complicated structure, and any attempt to modify the statutory conditions for health insurance benefit would have far-reaching and serious results on the financial stability of the scheme.  Much was  done by the 1928 Act to ease the conditions by allowing weeks of unemployment  to count as contributions, and we are satisfied that the present tests are not onerous, and that it is undesirable that they should be relaxed further.    102.  Having regard to the present state  of unemployment  and to the separate examination which is to be made of the unemployment insurance scheme, we  have not  considered  it  desirable to  make  any suggestions  regarding the statutory conditions of that scheme.    103v  There  are undoubtedly a few  cases in which an insured person drawing- health insurance benefit or unemployment benefit immediately before reaching 65 is not entitled to old age pension on reaching that age, because he has not completed five years of insurance.  In the majority of cases he will be qualified for the pension when he has completed five years&apos; insurance, and we do not consider that  the normal test for old  age pension of five years&apos; insurance should be modified  to meet the few cases of this nature.   The test is required to ensure that pensions are obtained only by those persons who normally belong to the insurable classes and have paid for them. If it were relaxed, there would  be a danger of persons not  dependent on insurable employment for a livelihood taking up some form of part-time insurable employment shortly before reaching age 65 with the express purpose of securing  the valuable rights of old age pensions for life for themselves and their wives.    104.  There  is  one  slight  overlapping  of  the  schemes  of  Unemployment Insurance and of Workmen&apos;s Compensation in that a man. receiving weekly payments under the Workmens  Compensation Act in respect of partial  incapacity can, ifunemployed, draw unemployment benefit in addition to compensation moneys.  This matter  will doubtless be considered by the Royal Commission about to be set up toexamine the scheme of&apos; Unemployment Insurance.
                     Chapter III. Scope of the Schemes.Possible  Extensions.    105.  On the general question of the classes of the persons brought within the compulsory  provisions of the schemes, we  are informed that  there is no seriousdemand for any extension, and we do not think that any general changes should bemade.   We  are  aware  that  the  income  limit  for  non-manual  workers in  theWorkmen&apos;s  Compensation Act is  350, although for the three national insurance schemes the income limit for such workers is  250.  We doubt whether the extensionof the income limit for non-manual workers to  350 for compulsory insurance underthe three schemes would be welcomed generally by those primarily concerned, whilesuch a proposal would meet with strong opposition from the employers.  The medical profession would also strongly object to this extension,  which would make medical benefit under the health insurance scheme available to a class of persons who are atpresent treated as private patients.   The doctors on many occasions have urged thatthere should be a strict income limit of  250 a year in any national scheme of medical services.     106.  There are three large groups of workers required to be insured under the health Insurance Acts which  are not covered for unemployment insurance.  Theseare agricultural workers,  private domestic  servants and  permanent  railwaymenThese three groups were excluded from  the comprehensive scheme of unemploymentinsurance introduced in  1920, because it was considered they were in no danger ofperiodic unemployment.     107.  As regards agricultural  workers, we understand that the  question isunder examination by the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Agriculture.    108.  In the case of workers in private domestic service,  there is no demand from any quarter for their inclusion in the Unemployment  Insurance  scheme,  andas there  is practically no unemployment among this  class, it would be difficult toimpose contributions on employers and workers, although from the standpoint oftransference of labour the inclusion  of domestic workers is to be desired.    109.  It is provided in the Unemployment Insurance Act that when the school leaving age is raised to 15  children over that age will come within the unemploy-ment scheme. We consider it is desirable that there should be correspondence betweenthe schemes  of health insurance and unemployment insurance  in this matter, butsubject to the maintenance of  the position that full  health insurance benefits shouldnot be paid to young persons until they  attain the age of 18.    110.  While there is  no  serious demand for an extension of the classes for compulsory  insurance, there has been,  since the introduction of the  contributory pensions scheme, an insistent demand for an extension of  the scope of voluntaryinsurance to enable the small shopkeeper, the tradesman in a small way of business,the dressmaker, the  music teacher,  the hawker, and other classes of uninsuredpersons of the same economic status as insured persons to become insured  on  a voluntary basis for the purposes of securing the benefits of that scheme.The Sjyecial  Voluntary Scheme.     111.  The present Contributory Pensions Scheme is limited broadly to personsin wage-earning employment and earning not more than  250 a year (in the case ofmanual workers there is no remuneration limit),  and to persons who,  having been insuch employment for two years, elected, on ceasing to be  insurably  employed, tocontinue in  insurance  as voluntary contributors.   At the  commencement of the contributory Pensions  Act persons not  then  insured who had previously  beeninsurably employed  for at least two years since 1912, when the Insurance Schemebegan, were given the opportunity to re-enter insurance as voluntary contributorswithin a prescribed  time.   The result of this limitation in the scope  of voluntaryinsurance is to exclude many persons of small means  who are not better fitted thanthose of the insured classes to make  independent provision against  the  risks ofwidowhood and old  age, and the small shopkeeper or tradesman  has  a legitimate-grievance in that he has-to contribute his share to the taxation of the country out ofwhich  are paid moneys towards a State Scheme from which he is excluded.
    112.  Insuperable difficulties  present themselves in any endeavour to frame ascheme of voluntary insurance for pensions  upon a self-supporting basis.   If  the contribution is to be related to the liability in each case it will depend upon the ageof the entrant, and (if he is married) the age of his wife, the number and ages of hischildren, the probabilities of further issue  to the  present  marriage and all  theprobabilities incidental to the remarriage of the contributor should he survive  his present wife.  Every combination of individual &quot;risks &quot; would require its own rateof  contribution  and  the   resulting complexities  would  go  far to  make  theadministration  of the scheme impossible.    113.  If to avoid  these complexities  a uniform or  flat-rate contribution were proposed, still on the condition that the contributions were in the aggregate to beof equal value with the benefits, the younger persons of the class to whom the schemewas offered would have to be greatly overcharged in order to meet the deficiency inthe contribution as applied to the older entrants.  The overcharge in the case of  theyoung would be palpable to anyone with a knowledge of life assurance risks indeed it would have to  be shown in the financial  statement submitted to Parliament withthe Bill setting up the scheme and if  the proposal  survived  parliamentary criticism it would  inevitably fail to secure the adhesion of  a great proportion.including the young, of those for  whom it was designed.  At the same time (and because  of  this  failure), it  would break down upon its financial  side.  We have accordingly been forced to accept  the situation that  if a  scheme of  voluntaryinsurance is set up  it will have to be financed to a substantial extent at the  cost ofthe State.    114.  The  Scheme  which wye put forward for consideration is set out in detai1in Appendix IV.  In brief, the  Scheme makes the benefits of contributory pensionsavailable to all uninsured persons with incomes not exceeding  400 a year.  Entrantsduring the first two years enter on  a flat  rate of contribution which is calculatedwith regard to (a) how much the individual of the class can be expected to pay, and(b)  the measure of State assistance wdiich  was given under the compulsory  schemeto initial entrants.  Entrants after the initial period will pay a rate of contributionfixed wholly according to the age at entry  and without regard to other  factorsaffecting the liability of the scheme towards the  individual.              Chapter IY. Disparities between Approved Societies.Partial Pooling of Valuation Surpluses of Approved Societies.    115.  The question of the inequalities of benefit in different approved societieswas a major problem before the Royal Commission on National Health  Insurancewhich reported in 1926.  At the time the problem was under consideration by themonly the additional benefit schemes following the first valuation were in operation.    116.  As a  result of  the  first  valuation some societies  were  able to  givesubstantial increases of the normal cash benefits and valuable treatment benefits,while others were unable to give anything more than the normal statutory benefits.These disparities between societies and between branches in the same society becamegreater  as a result of the second valuation, while so  far as can be forecast from theknown results of the third valuation  it seems clear  that the differences will  not befound to be any less when that valuation is completed.    117.  A detailed statement showing the  extent of  these differences and  the causes leading to them is contained in  appendix V  to this report.   It will be seen from that statement that the Royal Commission on  Health Insurance put forward a scheme for mitigating these inequalities  between  societies.  Briefly, this schemewas that 50 per  cent, of  the future surpluses earned in each five  years  should bepooled.    118.  At  the time when the Royal  Commission reported, it was estimated that under the conditions then prevailing there would be available for pooling about 1,000,000 a year.  The Royal Commission recommended that the money released bythis partial pooling of future surpluses should be used for the  provision of  a new
statutory  benefit  to be  available to all approved society members irrespective of whether the societies were already giving additional benefits out of surplus.  since that date, however, the growth of valuation surpluses has materially decreased andso far as can be forecast from present valuation results it seems doubtful whethermore than  500,000 a year would be realised by such a method of pooling.  In anycase, as the  third valuation is now  in progress, no pooling is possible except on theresults of the fourth valuation, and as these results will not begin to be availableuntil towards the end of 1934, such a scheme of partial pooling as is detailed abovecould not be put into operation until at the earliest 1934, or if the complete results ofthe fourth valuation were to be awaited, until 1938.     119.  The demand for the pooling of surpluses comes  wholly from the tradesunion group of approved societies.  There is opposition to the  proposal from allother groups of societies, and it is shown most markedly by the industrial assurancegroup and  the friendly societies.  There would  be undoubtedly grave difficulties for any Government which tried to put  into operation a system of  pooling,  as itwould be looked upon as the first step towards the abolition of the approved societies.Politically,  also, it is for consideration whether a proposal for pooling, which wouldrelease a sum which might not reach  500,000 a year and would not operate  untilat earliest 1934, would be of much help to the Government which proposed it.   Thetrade union group of approved societies would not be wholly satisfied, as they arelooking for  something immediate in the way of treatment benefits  for their members.while  all the  other approved  societies,  representing  the  great majority of the insured population, would definitely oppose the principle.Restoration of Health Insurance State Grant Moneys.     120.  We  put forward  another proposal for equalising to some  extent thebenefits of approved societies.  In brief, the proposal depends upon the  restorationof the annual Exchequer moneys which would have been available to societies hadnot the Economy Act of 1926 reduced the State grant from twro-ninths to one-seventhfor men and one-fifth for women.     121.  Under the Economy Act of 1926 the annual relief to the Exchequer fromthe reduction of  the State  Grant is about  2f millions.  Since that Act came intooperation there has been a strong demand from all groups of  Societies that theState Grant should be restored to its original proportion of two-ninths of the sumsexpended in benefits and administration,  and this demand for restoration has been kept alive by the increasing cost of sickness and disablement benefit in recent years.The present suggestion is not  that there  should  be a return to the position beforethe  Economy Act, but that the annual amount of  2f millions  should  be restored to National Health  Insurance  and used  for new benefits and for the  removal  ofinequalities as between Societies.   The Cabinet has had under consideration a newmaternity service for insured  persons which will involve an Exchequer charge  ofabout  1-1 millions a year.  This money might be treated as the return of part of themoneys taken away by the reduction of the State Grant.   !  millions still remainand two possible uses of this money have been suggested.  The Royal Commissionrecommended, when an annual sum of  1,000,000 was  estimated as the product ofthe scheme  of partial pooling  suggested by them, the provision of a  new  statutorybenefit in the  nature of specialist medical services to be available  to  all insuredpersons.  A scheme of this nature would  make a new treatment benefit available tothe  members of those  Societies (in common with all other  Societies) which are  atpresent  unable to give any  additional  treatment  benefits,  and to  this extentinequalities would be lessened.     122.  The other suggestion is  that the  !-  millions should be allotted to thoseSocieties  which,  on valuation,  are found to have no  disposable surpluses out  ofwhich additional benefits can  be provided.  The general demand at  present fromthis class of Societies is that  they should be enabled to provide dental treatment for their members, and this is a possible use which might be made of the moneys.     123.  We recommend that the  yearly sums which would have been payable hadnot  the  State  Grant been reduced should again be made available  for national health purposes  as suggested above.  We have not thought it necessary,  however, tosubmit proposals for a detailed scheme for the use of the  moneys which  would  bemade available.
    124.  &quot;We cannot submit this recommendation without drawing the attentionof our colleagues to the fact that the general body of the approved Societies wouldbe unlikely to regard this form of the restoration of the State Grant as equivalent tothe return to the position before the Economy Act.  The  ordinary State grant iscredited to each  Approved  Society  as a  proportion of its actual expenditure  inrespect of benefits and costs of administration, and the grant thus goes to swell theordinary funds of the Society.  Each Society, as a separate financial unit, controlsits own funds, and  it would be said of the above  proposal that the State wasdiverting moneys of which each Society should  have its proper share for disposalas its members&apos;might think fit.   We consider, however, that the moneys would  be best employed in the interests of insured persons  in the way we suggest and that theallotment of part of the restored  grant towards  reducing  in some  degree thedisparities between  Societies,  would assist in  removing  one  of  the greatestweaknesses of the Approved  Society system.   Chapter Y. Non-Contributory Old Age Pensions and Blind Persons Pensions. The &quot;Means &quot; Limit.     125.   The grant of old age pensions at age 70 to persons who do not qualify for them by insurance and of pensions to blind persons is conditional, inter alia, on the satisfaction of a &quot; means &quot; test.     126.   It  has often been suggested that the  &quot; means &quot;  limit should be abolished and that all persons over 70 should be entitled to 10s.  a week irrespective of their means and earnings.   Such a change would cost about an  additional  11,000,000 a year  at once,  on the  assumption that all eligible persons  would take the  pension. Apart altogether from repercussions on the contributory pensions scheme, the cost seems to us to make such a proposal impracticable.   Further, if the voluntary scheme which we have formulated for uninsured persons wrere adopted, it would go far to meet all reasonable claims for the removal of  the &quot;means&quot;  limit.   Those who entered the voluntary scheme  w-ould be  entitled to old age pensions at age 70 by virtue of their insurance, and the &quot;means &quot; test would not be applied to them. It has  already been removed as regards all insured persons who qualify under the present Contributory scheme. .     127.   Apart from the abolition of the  &quot;means&quot; limit, there have been two other proposals from  time to time for concessions in assessing means.   The Labour Government of 1924 made a concession in the calculation of means by allowing a deduction of  39 a year in respect of means other than earnings.   This was done to meet the plea that the &quot; means &quot;  limit penalised thrift, and on  the ground that it was undesirable  at a time of serious  unemployment to  encourage old people to compete in the labour market.   It has been urged that this concession should apply also to earnings.    128.   It is  necessary to point out that after  the  deduction of  39 a year in respect of  savings has been made in calculating the means,  a full pension is still payable if the remaining means (earnings or savings) do not exceed  26 5s. a year.    These  deductions and allowances are doubled in the case of  a  married couple. A married man  over 70, and whose  wife  is also over 70, can thus earn up to  1 a week, and  if their  combined means, apart from earnings, do not  exceed   78 per annum, they can each draw the full  old age pension of 10s. a week, so bringing up their total income to  3 10s.  a Aveek.  A single person whose  total means from sources other than earnings are 25s. a week, can obtain 10s. a week pension, and a married couple both over 70 can draw a combined pension of  1  a  week if their combined means from  sources other than earnings amount to 50s. a week.    129.  Were the deduction  of  39 in calulating means to be made applicable to earnings as wrell as savings, it is estimated that the cost of doing this Avould be about  1,500,000  a year.  We understand  that in limiting this concession to means other than earnings, the Government of 1924 had in mind the undesirability in the then state  of unemployment of encouraging old people over 70  to continue at  work. This argument has, of course,  far greater force in the more serious conditions of the present day,  and the case for any further concession in regard to the &quot;means &quot;limit has been greatly weakened by the adoption of the contributory pensions scheme,       [22049]                                                          E
and  would  be still  further  met  by the  introduction of  the voluntary schemerecommended above.  While, therefore, on logical grounds there is much to be said in favour of a uniform &quot; means &apos;&apos; limit, irrespective of the nature of the means, wedo not feel able to recommend an expenditure of some  1,500,000 per annum for thispurpose at the present time.    130.  The other proposal  relates to the method of assessing the annual valueof investments or property in arriving at the means of the claimant.  This is doneon a capital basis, ignoring the first  25, taking 5 per cent,  on the next  375, and10 per cent, on any balance.   It is suggested that the percentage  of 10 per cent.is too high  on  that portion of the capital value exceeding   400.   The principle underlying the calculation  is that  the capital should be treated on a very liberalannuity basis, and  it seems to us reasonable that this should be done, rather than to permit the  receipt of a State pension by a person of considerable means  whichare kept intact for  the benefit of his descendants.  Any change in the method of assessment which operated to keep  the capital intact would be an endowment of thedescendants, rather than of the pensioner, at the cost of the State.  We do not recommend any change in this method of assessment.    131.   Persons in receipt of old age pensions are  disqualified for the receipt ofpension while  they are inmates of  poor law institutions, unless they enter for thepurpose of receiving medical or surgical treatment.    132.  A person in receipt of a non-contributory  over-70 pension who  enters apoor  law  institution for the purposes  of  receiving medical  or surgical treatment.although not disqualified for the receipt of pension, is still subject to the   means &quot;test, and the value of the benefits received in the institution  constitute an accession to his means and are taken into account for the purposes of determining  the rateof pension.   The position is the same where such a pensioner enters any non-poorlaw  institution.   In estimating the value  of the benefits  regard  is had to the published reports of the institution of the average weekly cost of patients.  As aresult of the recent  Local Government Act the standard of hospital accommodation is likely to rise, with a consequential increase in the  number of pensioner inmateswho will have their pensions withdrawn.  It has been suggested that in estimating the value of benefits received,  regard should be had only to  the value of board  andlodging, and that medical treatment and expenses and  the value of equipment shouldbe disregarded.     133.  If this were done, however, in the great majority of  cases any pension would not be  available to the pensioner  as it is a common practice for  poor  lawauthorities to appropriate the pension to reimburse them in respect of the cost of the patient.   In these cases there  would be no material gain  to the pensioner and thepayments would amount merely to an Exchequer grant in aid of rates.  It might bethat an inmate would wish  the payment of pension to be made either on the groundthat his relatives would be relieved to that extent or, it has been suggested  to us, sothat he might retain his self respect.     134.   The proposal in isolation is reasonable but it  would require  legislation and we fear the many demands which would arise on the  introduction of such ameasure.  Undoubtedly there would be a demand to exclude, not merely the value of medical treatment, but also the cost  of board and lodging.  Voluntary institutionsas well as the local authorities hospitals would  be concerned.   If the cost  of boardand lodging were also excluded there would then  be no argument against paying-pensions to all poor law inmates.     135.   We do not recommend an alteration  in the method of assessment of the &quot;means&quot; of persons who become inmates of institutions  for medical  treatment,firstly, because there would be little gain to the pensioner, and, secondly, because ofthe  danger of repercussions on the closely allied question of the disqualification for pension of ordinary poor law inmates.Pensions to Blind Persons.     136.   There have  been frequent representations  that a grievance exists in the case of insured blind persons when they reach the age of 70.  A blind person&apos;s pension is payable at age 50  and  if he is  insured  and  satisfies  the condition  for a
contributory old age pension he is paid the contributory old age pension at age 65in addition to his blind person&apos;s pension.  He is thus in receipt of  1 a week fromage 65 to 70.   On reaching 70  only the over-70 pension of 10s.  a week, free of themeans test, is payable to him.    137.  The suggestion is that there should be no drop at age 70 for such persons as their needs are  equally  great thereafter.    The  apparent anomaly  came intoprominence when contributory  old age pensions began.    Before that date a blindperson was  entitled to receive  sickness or disablement benefit under  the HealthInsurance Acts up to age 70.  From 65 to 70, therefore, the average weekly payment was about 19s., representing 10s. blind person&apos;s pension plus 9s. disablement benefit;(the average addition of Is.  6d, due to additional benefits, has been added to thenormal rate of 7s. Qd. a week disablement benefit).  On  reaching 70 he ceased  to be eligible  for health insurance benefit which was withdrawn and thereafter he receivedonly the normal old age pension.  The Contributory Pensions Act,  1925, made animprovement for the blind person by substituting an unconditional old age pension of 10s. a week for the conditional health insurance benefit of 9s. a week or less.  TheAct conferred a further benefit  on some blind persons aged 65 to 70 who had means,as the contributory old age pension is not reckonable as means whereas formerly the health insurance benefit had to be taken into account.    138.  We must point out that if the proposal to continue the  1 a  week to the insured  blind person after age 70  were adopted  there  would undoubtedly  be  ademand  that   1 a  week should  be paid  to all blind  persons over 70  whetherinsured or not.    139.  At present the  difference between the sums  payable on account of pension to uninsured blind persons between the ages of 65 and 70, and to insured blind personsbetween  these ages can be justified on the ground that the insured person has paid for the  second pension payable to him.  If, however, the second 10s. a week is tocontinue to be paid to the insured blind person after age 70, it cannot be contended that he has paid for that second pension. The grant of the concession to the insuredblind  persons might consequently be followed by a demand for the double pension onbehalf of all persons over  70 suffering from impaired vision within the definition ofthe Blind Persons Act.  The cost of conceding such a demand would .probably bevery great, regard being had to  the extent of seriously defective sight  among the veryaged.  Further, we realise that there might be a plea from all totally disabled personsover the age of 70 that they should receive equally favourable treatment as  a person of the same age who is disabled by blindness.   Here  again the cost  of a concession would be enormous.    140.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, we recommend that the double pension payable to an insured blind person between the ages of 65 and 70 shall continue tobe paid  after he reaches the age of 70.    141.  It is estimated that the cost in  1930-31 of restoring pensions to  blind persons  withdrawn since January 1928, the date when contributory pensions began,would be about  27,500.  To this sum it would be necessary to add a further amount which might  be as much as   100,000 representing the cost of pensions  to (1)  blindinsured persons who, because they attained age 70 before January 1928, have neverreceived a contributory pension; and (2) insured persons who became  blind after age70. The cost at the outset would thus be about  127,500 and would increase withthe growth in the aged population  and would probably reach an  ultimate figureof  200,000 a year.    142.  Pensions for blind persons are  at present payable at the age of  50 thisage having been adopted  as the age  at which it was  difficult  to train such personsin any remunerative occupation.  On several occasions it has been suggested that theage limit should be reduced  from 50 to 40.  The present Government have statedthat the matter is under&apos;consideration and the late Prime Minister in the course ofhis election campaign said that  the reduction of the age to 40 was part of his policy;recently the Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind expressed  the opinionthat such a reduction would be  justified.  We recommend  that the statutory age forthe receipt of blind person&apos;s pension should be reduced from 50 to 40.   We recognisethat it is difficult to see any ground of principle once one departs from the criterionof capacity for training.  On this point it should be noted that Approved Societies      [22049]                                                       E  2
are prepared to regard an insured person who becomes blind after attaining the ageof 50 as permanently incapable of work,  but that below that age they pay benefitonly for a limited period of about a year  during which the blind person under theage of 50 is expected to equip himself by training for new work.     143.  We base our recommendation on the ground that State assistance shouldbe given at an earlier age  to those who are afflicted with blindness, but we do notconsider that the approved societies shall  be.  expected to pay disablement benefit at such an age as 40 on the ground  that a person of this age is incapable of training.The cost of reducing the age limit to 40 is estimated to be about  150,000 a year.The Definition of Blindness.    144.  The  qualification for a pension under the Blind Persons&apos;  Act is that aperson must be  &quot;so blind as to be unable to perform  any work for which eyesight isessential.&quot;   Relative  blindness,  rather than the total loss of sight, is thus thestandard by wThich a  claim is judged.  We  have not called for a report from thedepartments  administering  these pensions  on the  general experience of the suitability of the definition and its application in practice  by the local committees which adjudicate on claims for pension, but figures have been submitted to us whichsuggest either that the interpretation of the definition is becoming more lenient or that an increasing number of persons with serious impairment of vision are claimingto be registered as blind  persons.    145.  We are informed that on the  30th June, 1926,  the number  of personsbetwreen the ages of 50 and 70 in receipt of pensions  on the ground of  blindness was16,075; on the 30th September, 1930, the number was 23,042.  It seems  to us most unlikely that the number of really blind persons is increasing at the same rate.  Wehave made  recommendations which, if adopted, will  increase the State expenditurein respect of blind persons, but in making them we had in mind blind persons withinthe real  intention of  the Blind Persons&apos;  Act, and  we  think it desirable that the responsible departments should examine the present definition to see if it is the mostsuitable which can be devised for practical  application in dealing with claims for pension.           Chapter YI. Retirement Pensions and Increased Pensions.Pensions at Age 60.    146.   In  a Report on  retirement  pensions, submitted to the Cabinet on the26th November, 1929, estimates were given of the cost of the permanent scheme of retirement pensions for workers over the age of 60.    147.   In  obtaining these estimates the basis of the scheme was that  pensions should be payable to workers on attaining the age of 60, provided that they exercisedtheir  option to  retire from work and take the pension within not more  than sixmonths after attaining that age.  The  pension  was to be at the rate of   1 a week to a single person and 30s. a week to the married couple, and was to continue for lifeonce granted.    148.   This scheme  was to cover all workers  insured under the unemploymentinsurance scheme,  with the addition of  the railway workers, who are excepted fromUnemployment Insurance.   Agricultural  workers and workers in private  domestic service  were thus excluded.  It was also  to be a  condition of  the scheme thatpensioners should  permanently  refrain  from  wage earning  employment.  Thepensions were only to be available to those actually in work and to  those who wereavailable for but unable to obtain insurable employment, so that only those who wereactual competitors in the labour market would be covered.  The cost to the exchequer of this scheme was estimated to be as follows :-                                                                          In 1930-31  ...       ...      ...      ...     21,600,000             In 1935-36  ...       ...      ...      ...     32,000,000             In 1940-41  ...       ...      ...      ...     38,000,000             In 1945-46  ...       ...      ...      ...     42,000,000
     149.   The charge would continue to rise for many years with the growth of thepopulation at ages over 60.  The difficulties inherent in such a scheme are formidable,but we have not thought it necessary to go over the ground which was covered by the retirement Pensions Sub-Committee in its Report, as, apart from important general considerations  there advanced,  the  cost seems to us to be prohibitive in  presentcircumstances.     150.   We  have obtained some estimates of the cost of the scheme of retirement pensions discussed at the  Labour Party Conference of 1930.   We have interpretedthis scheme as  contemplating a pension of 30s. to married men and 20s. to singlepersons, aged 60 and over, engaged in insurable occupations.  If the persons eligiblefor inclusion in the scheme were limited to those employed (or available for employ-ment) in the occupations covered by the Unemployment Insurance Acts,  togetherwith railwaymen and workers engaged in agriculture and private domestic service,the cost would  be about  30,300.000 rising to about  50,000,000 in ten years&apos; time.If, however,  a  wider interpretation were adopted and persons insured under theNational Health  Insurance Acts,  who w&apos;ere  permanently  incapacitated  at  the inception of  the scheme,  and minor classes of insured persons, such as outworkers,were  also  included,  these  figures  would  become   33,500,000 and   54,000,000respectively.  All these figures are additional to the cost of existing pension schemes.    151.   If a scheme of pensions at  the same  rates of 30s.  a  week to  insuredmarried men and 20s. a week to other insured men and women at age 60 were given without any  conditions as to retirement from work,  we are informed that, at thepresent  time, the cost would be approximately  75,000.000.  In 10 years&apos; time thecost w-ould have risen to  95,000,000.    152.   If the existing contributory old age pensions at the rate of 10s. a weekwere payable at age 60 to insured persons and their waves, the estimated increase in cost would  be about  25,000,000, apart  from any consequential loss of contribution income.   In ten years&apos; time the additional cost would have grown to  30,000,000a year.Increase in the Rate of Old A ge Pensions.    153.  It has. been suggested from time to time that an increase in the rates ofthe present old age pensions is desirable, apart from other reasons, on the groundthat an increased pension would induce many workers to retire on reaching pension age, thus creating vacancies for unemployed  workers.   It is clear that the numberof retirements would depend to a  large degree upon the  rate of pension.  Withpensions at  a flat rate  the inducement to  retire would vary as between classes ofworkers, apart from  individual circumstances, because a pension which might beregarded as adequate for retirement by one class of workers would be looked upon as totally insufficient by those in better-paid regular employment.     154.  It  could  not be expected  that a scheme of  &quot; inducement &quot; pensions,however generous the pensions might be, would create as many vacancies for youngerworkers as a scheme of &quot; retirement &quot; pensions at the same rates requiring a workerto give up work as a condition of receiving the pension, but we have  not made an exhaustive comparison of the respective merits of conditional &quot; retirement  &quot; pensionsand &quot; inducement &quot; pensions without a condition as to leaving work.     155.  The figures we have obtained of the cost of an increase in the rate ofexisting old age pensions from the present rate of 10s. to 15s. a week seem to us tomake any jDroposal for an increase impossible at the present time.    156.  In  the present financial year the cost to the Pensions Fund of 65-70 old age  pensions  is  approximately  16 millions.   The cost to the Exchequer  of allover-70 pensions is approximately  36-1 millions.  If, therefore, it was proposed toincrease the present rate of 10s. a week to 15s. a week, the additional cost would beabout  26 millions immediately.   We are informed that this sum would increase fora considerable number of years at something over 3 per cent,  per annum.  In tenyears&apos; time the cost of the increased rate would be about  35 millions.    157.  An increase in the rate of old age pensions would inevitably lead to thedemand that all widows&apos; pensions should be increased to the same extent.   It would
be exceedingly difficult to resist this demand, but if it could be withstood, it wouldbe necessary to give an increased pension to those widows between the ages of  65and 70 to correspond with the old age pension rates payable to persons between thesame ages.    158.  The initial cost of this consequential increase to widows between the ages of 65 and 70 would be about If million pounds.    159   The additional cost of a scheme under which unconditional pensions of30s. per week were granted to married men and 20s. per week  to unmarried personsaged  65  and  over is estimated  to   be  about   100.000,000, rising  to  about 130,000,000 in ten years&apos; time.                    Chapter YII. Miscellaneous Questions,W orkmen&apos;s Compensation.    160.  The Report by  the  Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Compulsory Insurance)Committee was referred to us  to consider the possibility of making insurance inrespect of workmen&apos;s compensation  compulsory on employers.  Since this  reference was made we are informed that the  Secretary of State has had submitted to him bya Joint Committee of the Trades Union Congress General Council, the Labour party and the Parliamentary Labour Party proposals of a most far-reaching nature forthe revision of the law relating to workmen&apos;s compensation and  of the whole system by which the present scheme is administered.  We understand that these  proposals are now being explored by the Home Office in consultation with the Joint Committee.The matter of compulsory insurance is included in these wider proposals, which, weunderstand, will require  prolonged examination, and in these circumstances we feel it would be premature for us to proceed with our examination of  the limited question referred to us.    161.  There is also the consideration that there is no Exchequer contribution to-the scheme  of workmen&apos;s compensation, which  differentiates  it from the social insurance contributory services with  which  the Committee has  been primarily concerned.Pensions Contributions for Men of  the Forces.    162.  Under the Contributory  Pensions Act the rate of contribution for men serving  in the Forces is the same as that for civilians. But a pension under the Actis not payable to a person who is in receipt of a service  dependants pension (unlessthe latter pension is in respect of the death of a son or  stepson in the Great War).The pension paid by the Service Department to the widow of a man who is killed ordies as a result of his service is within the definition of service dependants pension,so that  such  a widow cannot get a pension under the Contributory Pensions Act.On the other hand,  the widow of a civilian who is killed at wrork is entitled to apension under the Act, notwithstanding that she receives a compensation under theWorkmen&apos;s Compensation Act.    163.  This difference of treatment was the subject of much  interdepartmentaldiscussion when the Act of 1925 was in preparation.   It was represented by theMinistry of Pensions that it would be impossible to allow widows of men who served in the post-war forces of the  Crown to receive  pension under  the ContributoryPension Act in addition  to a service dependants pension without serious danger ofreaction on Avar pensions paid to Avidows.  Thousands of men discharged  with Avarinjuries are  employed in  civil life  and  are  paying full contributions under thePensions Act.  Nevertheless, if on  death from their Avar disabilities their  widowsare granted a Avar pension, the AvidoAv&apos;s pension under the Act is  not payable.    164.  Further, if the widows of men dying from war injuries many years afterthe Avar were to be granted the double pension, the Ministry of Pensions consideredthat  it would be very difficult to refuse  at least equal treatment  to  the widows ofmen who had succumbed to their injuries at an early date.   To  have admitted all
 these widows to the double pension was estimated to involve an additional liability on the Exchequer of between  4,000,000 and  5,000,000 a year.  Various alternative proposals of an intermediate character were  considered at the time, but in  the end it was decided to leave the scheme in its present form.     165.  Further experience  of  the working of the  scheme has led to renewed protests on  behalf  of the men  in  the Forces, and the  case for some  concession is naturally  becoming stronger as  the period of  contribution increases and the widow&apos;s pension becomes less and less a free  gift from the State.  Failing the grant of  the widow&apos;s pension in these cases  in  addition to  the service  dependants pension, attention has been given to the alternative of  reducing the contributions to an extent actuarially equivalent to the rights so withheld.  It is estimated by the Government Actuary that this  reduction would  be  approximately  \d. a week.  Thus,  of  the weekly contribution in these cases were reduced from 4\d. to 4c?., the substance would be taken from the charge of unfair treatment.    166.  Such a differential rate could, however, only be  put into force in  regard to men now and in future serving in the  Forces, though it should be pointed out that it is largely in respect of these that complaints at present arise.  Moreover, there can be little doubt that the reduction of only \d. a week would  hardly prove satis- factory to the limited number of  widows  who  found in  it  the  logical  bar  to the admission of their claim to a  double pension.  We understand that the Service Departments have accordingly  proposed that the \d. a week per man, representing in the aggregate some  30,000 per annum, should be accumulated in a  special fund, from  which  awards should be made in such cases supplemental  to the  service dependants pension.    167.  The administration of such a  fund would necessarily raise its own special problems.  In particular, there is the danger of reaction on war pensions.  We are,however, definitely of opinion  that the  whole question  should be  again considered forthwith by the departments concerned, with a view to the removal of the  presentgrievance.                              Signed  on behalf of the  Committee,                                                      ARNOLD (Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,   November 28, 1930.
!AN OUTLINE OF THE APPROVED SOCIETY SYSTEM AND OF THE FINANCE OF THE SOCIAL                              INSURANCE SCHEMES.    This appendix  is  limited  to  information relevant  to   the  question  of&quot;amalgamation of the schemes.The Approved Society System.    1.  In intention the Health Insurance scheme was  planned so that it  mightbe administered as far as might be by self-governing bodies created by and answerable to the insured persons themselves.  Approved Societies are all subject to two mainstatutory conditions:     (1)  That the Society shall not be conducted for profit, and    (2)  That its constitution shall provide for its affairs being subject to the absolute          control of its members.    2.  The system followed on that which had grown up over a long period of yearsthrough the voluntary insurance of workers through friendly societies and the benefitside of the trades union movement.    3.  Apart from  the fact  that it would probably have been  found at the timeimpossible to work a  system of national health insurance without the help of thesewell-established  bodies, their  use  for  National  Health  Insurance purposes was justified as a means of conserving the voluntary system which had grown up.    4.  Approved Societies are of many different types, the  chief being friendly societies  (with  or without branches,  and including  rural  Societies formed for national Health Insurance), Trade Unions, Societies formed by  Industrial AssuranceCompanies or Collecting Societies, and Employers Provident Funds for  persons inthe service of particular employers.    5.  Definite  Parliamentary  pledges were given  when   the  original  HealthInsurance Bill was  introduced that insured  persons should have the privilege of joining a society  of  their own choice, and  as a. result  about 6 million men  and2 million women elected to take their State insurance through Friendly Societies andTrade Unions, out of a total  insured population at that  date  of about 13 millions.In the great majority of cases these persons were already members  of  the  bodiesthrough which they have elected to take their national health insurance benefits, andin  the  rural  districts  particularly derive considerable  advantage in   respect ofadditional benefits from the association of insured persons  of the same type, in regardto occupation and environment.  Without such advantages it would be  difficult to resist the contention  often made that the health insurance contribution  is too highfor the  rural worker. On the other hand some of these  approved societies consistsolely of members whose rate of sickness is high owing to environment and occupation,and this applies particularly  to miners&apos; societies.   Some  such  societies are not ableto provide any  of the additional benefits which  are available  to insured personsgenerally, while others have very small amounts available.    6.  Not all  the persons in a particular trade or  industry  belong to  the Societyor Societies which are connected with the trade or  industry, and in fact the majorityof Approved Societies have mixed memberships,  and recruit  members irrespective of their calling, a result which was inevitable from a system which gave  free choice of society to the person becoming insured.    7.  A general supervision over the administration of the health insurance schemeis undertaken by the Ministry  of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland,and as regards their  relation with the Approved Societies their main duty is to see,in the interests of insured persons, that the Societies maintain a  proper standard ofadministration.  The central departments are empowered to grant approval to a bodyof  persons which wishes to become an Approved Society,  while the rules  of  all
 Societies are  subject to the approval of the departments,  which are also the final courts of appeal in disputes between a member and his Society.   The Societies  are also  required  to  submit for approval their proposals  for  the use  of  valuation surpluses.     8.   The duties of Approved Societies consist of mainly :      (a)  The issue and collection of contribution cards,     (b)  The adjudication upon  claims for cash benefits, the payment of benefits and           the supervision of members in receipt of benefit to guard against improper           payments,     (c)  The administration of  treatment benefits under an  additional  benefits           scheme.     The Approved Societies also, for the most part,  undertake the task of delivering the contribution cards to their members, and on this depends, in a high degree,  the success with which the contributions for health insurance are collected.     9.   The Royal Commission on National Health Insurance, reporting in 1926, dealt with &quot; the Approved Society System &quot; in Chapters VIII  and IX, and while specifically stating that they had. not been asked to consider the unification of social Insurance, the Majority submitted a recommendation that Approved Societies should be retained as an essential part of the Health Insurance System, though they added the following:          Paragraph 223.  It must be clearly understood that our recommendation     is made in relation to the Scheme of National Health  Insurance as it exists at     present, and that our view in favour of the retention  of Approved Societies does     not  necessarily imply that developments in the system  of Social Insurance outside     the  range of present contemplation might not necessitate a reconsideration of the     position.     The Minority Report on the other hand, concludes :      (6)  That the Approved Society system is a hindrance to the development of a           complete Public Health policy.     (7)  That it is undesirable to retain Approved Societies any longer as the agencies           for the distribution of cash benefits to  insured persons.     (8)  That Local Authorities could and should take  the  place of Approved           Societies as the bodies through whom sickness  and  disablement  benefits           should be administered.     10.  The National Health Insurance Act provides that each Approved Society shall have control of its own funds derived from the contributions of its members and their employers and that  any  surplus  disclosed  on a valuation of its  assets and liabilities shall remain at the disposal of the Society to be used only in  the provision of additional benefits for its own members, as those members shall determine.  The State grant for National  Health Insurance consists of  a  fixed proportion of  the expenditure  on benefits and the costs  of  administration, and is  credited to  the Approved Societies on actual expenditure for these  purposes.  Where a Society  has been  approved as a Society  with branches, each branch  is self-governing and is a separate and independent financial unit.     11.  There are under  the Health Insurance  scheme  some  7,000 Societies and  Branches.     12.  There is not, therefore, one common health insurance fund.  It is true that a sum of  125 millions in  reserve has been accumulated, but  this reserve is  the aggregate of  the funds of  the  7,000 Societies and branches  partly invested  by themselves  in securities held by  their  own  trustees; and  partly  invested  by  the Central Departments on their behalf.  It is not free money.  The liability to sickness and  disablement benefit rises with age while the  contributions are equated to the liability  in respect of an entrant at the age of 16.   It is essential consequently that,out of the contributions paid in early life sufficient  reserves should be  accumulated to meet the benefit charges in the later years, when the  contributions  alone Avouldbe no longer adequate.   The sufficiency of the reserves is  tested by the  periodical       [22049]                                                         F
valuations.  At the second valuation, surpluses amounting to some  42 millions weredeclared and these, with  any surpluses that may be subsequently  earned, will  berequired to maintain the  provision of w^ell-established additional benefits, such  asDental and Ophthalmic Benefit and Treatment in Hospitals and Convalescent Homes,as well as the additions to cash benefits to wdiich the insured population has now become  accustomed.Finance of the Contributory Pensions Scheme.     13.  There  is one fund for the Contributory Pensions scheme into  which  are paid the contributions of  the workers and  the employers.   The Exchequer makes a fixed yearly contribution to the fund and also assumes any residual liability.  Thecontributions of the workers and empkryers are paid at the same time as  the health,insurance contributions, a joint stamp being used.     The Contributory Pensions scheme  is administered centrally,  the post  officesbeing used for the actual payment of the pensions.Finance and Administration of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.     14.  The Unemployment Insurance scheme is financially a single unit and intothe  one Unemployment Fund  are  paid the contributions&quot; of the employers,  theworkers and the  State. The State Contribution is at the rate of one-half of the jointcontributions from the employers  and the workers.     15.  The work of  administration is  carried out by  the Head Office of  theMinistry of Labour,  the Divisional Offices of  the Ministry and the EmploymentExchanges and  Branch  Employment Offices.   The  Employment Exchanges andBranch  Employment  Offices  are the chief local agencies of administration.   their work in this connection is supervised by the Divisional Controller  for their area, who in turn  is responsible to the Headquarters of the Ministry.     16.   It might appear  that in Unemployment Insurance the general principle of central  administration and a central fund is modified to  some  extent by the factthat some of the  work in connection with the payment of benefits is being carried  outby Trade Unions and  other Associations, but this system is not comparable with  the approved Society system, since the Associations have  no independent financial responsibility. The work is inconsiderable  in relation to the scheme as a whole andthe Trade Unions are only  repaid by the Department such amount of benefit to which their unemployed members would have been entitled had  they made their claimsdirect to the Department.  Accordingly, the Unions are  in effect acting  under  the directions of the statutory  authorities which  adjudicate  on claims and  are  not themselves the adjudicating  authority, or financially responsible.Cost of  Administration of the Schemes.     17.   The approximate present cost of administering the present social insuranceservices is as follows :     The total comes to  11,850,000  a year, and this will be diminished when thevolume of unemployment is materially abated.  This figure covers, in addition to thecost of  general  administration and collection  of&apos; contributions,  the  expensesincidental to the authorisation and payment of monetary benefits aggregating about 120 millions per annum, represented by nearly 150,000,000 separate disbursements.The annual income of the three schemes  from contributions  and State grants.excluding the recent special Exchequer contribution to the Unemployment Fund, isat present approximately  108 millions.  The  administration expenditure is  thusabout 11 per cent, of the contribution income.Unemployment InsuranceNational Health Insurance     ...       ...Pensions under the Contributory Pensions  a year.5,450.0005.300.000Act1,100,000
   AMALGAMATION OF HEALTH (AND PENSIONS) AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE                             CONTRIBUTION  CARDS.   (Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term  &quot;Health&quot; throughout this             Memorandum should be  read  as including &quot; Pensions.&quot;)Existing System.    1.   The  existing methods  of collecting  contributions under  the Health and unemployment Insurance schemes are broadly as follows :      2.   Health. Approved Societies supply their members with contribution cardshalf-yearly, the new  cards being usually issued shortly before the old cards expire.New entrants into  insurance  make  formal application for membership  to  the approved Society of their choice.  The Society before accepting them verifies thatthey do not already  belong to another Society; and  it also  enquires  how long theapplicant has been employed, in order to see that contributions have been paid fromthe commencement.   Entrants into insurance can also obtain cards at a Post Office(whether or not they intend to join an Approved Society later) and at any time  aninsured person can obtain a card at a Post Office if he has not received one from hisApproved Society.    3.   The cards show the member&apos;s number in the Society, his name and addressand a secret code number or  cipher indicating by which Society the card has beenissued.  The workers hand the cards to their employers who purchase at Post OfficesHealth and Pensions Insurance stamps to be affixed to the cards.   At the end  of the half year (or when the worker leaves the employment, whichever is the earlier) thecards are returned by the employers to the  employees.  The  employees are requiredto surrender  them to their  Societies within 14 days after the end of  the half yearand are entitled to a receipt in the form of an entr)^ on their Membership RecordCards.   The Societies enter the number  of contributions in their ContributionRegisters and finally forward the cards to the Ministry of Health  in support of their claim for credit from the National Health Insurance Fund.    The records of contributions are  required mainly for     (a) determining whether the numbers  of contributions required to qualify for           the various benefits have been paid since entry into insurance;    (b) calculating to what extent the members are in arrears in each contribution           year, as affecting their benefits  in the ensuing benefit year;    (c) ascertaining, in the case of a member who ceases to be employed,  how long           his &quot;free period of insurance &quot; lasts and whether he is entitled to be a           voluntary contributor;    (d) furnishing to the Ministry of Health, when a claim  to contributory pension           arises, a certificate of the contributions paid in the material years.Unemployment.    4.  An  insured  contributor  obtains  an  Unemployment Book on  enteringinsurance by making personal application at an Employment Exchange or other local office of the Department (hereinafter referred to as an Employment Exchange).He is required to furnish  certain particulars, e.g.,  full name,  date of  birth,occupation, &amp;c, and to sign a form of  application.   The particulars are important for the purpose of identification, and the signature is essential for comparison withthat oh a claim to benefit made by the contributor.  The form  of application iscombined with  a form of record for the contributions paid and benefit received bythe contributor.  These forms are afterwards bound in binders and constitute theledger accounts of the contributors.  All the ledger accounts are kept at one  centre at fcew, Surrey.      [22049]&quot;                                                       F 2
    5.  When the form of application has been completed, an Unemployment Bookof the appropriate kind is issued.  The book bears not only the name and address ofthe contributor, but also  a &quot;book number&quot;  corresponding  to  the  number  of theapplication, and comprising the name of the local office at  which the applicationwas made  and a serial number,  e.g., Southampton/12345.  In addition, the bookbears code letters indicating the industry of the insured contributor.  This classifica-tion is very important, as it forms the sole basis of statistics  compiled  for actuarialcalculations and for ascertaining the number  of insured persons and the extent ofunemployment in each industry.  During  employment the employer keeps the book;when the holder is unemployed it is kept at a  Local Office.    6.  When the currency of the book expires it is surrendered to an employment exchange and a new book is issued in lieu thereof.  Regular books  are current fora period of about twelve months, expiring usually at the commencement of July.The old book  may be surrendered by the insured contributor personally  or  by the employer if the contributor is in employment.  Special  arrangements are made inthe case of larger employers by which the books are exchanged in bulk.   For personswho are unemployed new books  are automatically prepared and exchanged for theold books lodged at the Exchange.  The expired books are checked for the purposeof statistical classification, and sorted and counted  so that the  necessary statistical information is obtained.   The books are afterwards sent by the Exchange  to theCentral Record  Office  at Kew, where the  contributions are recorded and the books filed.    7.  Claims to benefit may be made  at any Exchange.  As a precaution againstfraud the  claimant  is required to lodge his  book  when he  makes  a  claim. Thelodging of the book also enables the number  of contributions  paid  on the currentbook to be ascertained.  Particulars on the claim are compared with those furnished by  the  applicant when he  made  application  for  his  book  for the  purpose  ofestablishing identity, and at the same time the number of contributions standing tothe contributors credit  at the  Central Record Office  is ascertained.  For these purposes it will be seen that reference from  the Exchange to the Central RecordOffice is essential under the present procedure whenever  a claim to benefit is made.Benefit  on  a  claim is paid locally, subject,  of course,  to compliance  with theprescribed  conditions.    8.  As stated above, an important function  of the book is to enable statistics tobe prepared.  The statistical records prepared at the Exchange from the old bookssurrendered are sent to  the Headquarters of  the Department, where they are summarised to serve  as the basis of  the published statistical returns.   These andstatistical  studies of  contributions paid by  contributors in various  groups and industries are important in the  administration  and development of  UnemploymentInsurance,  particularly at the present time.  To make these studies, it  is necessarythat the Ministry of Labour shall have the Unemployment Books after surrender.Possible Amalgamated Systems.    9.  The following are the four main types of schemes for amalgamating these methods of payment of contributions which require examination :     Scheme 1.  A  half-yearly joint card with a joint stamp.   Approved Societies         to issue and collect the cards, record all the contributions and,  on  request of         the Ministry of  Labour, supply  information as to the number,  value and         dates of Unemployment Insurance contributions when this information  is         required for the purposes of a claim for benefit.    Scheme 2.  A  half-yearly joint card with a joint stamp.   Approved Societies         to issue and collect  the  cards and to notify to  the Ministry of Labour,         immediately  on  receipt of the  card,  the number,  value and dates of         Unemployment Insurance contributions represented on the card.    Scheme 3.  A yearly joint card with a joint stamp.  Employment Exchanges to         issue and collect the cards, and  the  Ministry of  Labour to notify the         number, value and dates of the Health contributions to Approved Societies         annually, or at other times when required.
     Scheme 4.  A half-yearly joint card, with separate Health and Unemployment         stamps, similar to the Class  P card used for employed  persons over 65.         Approved Societies to issue and collect the cards, and to detach the Unem-         ployment portions  and send them to the Ministry of Labour  immediately         after collection.     10.  Under all four schemes the administration of and procedure for claiming unemployment benefit would remain as at present in  the hands of the Ministry of Labour,  which would require  the card to be  lodged  at an Employment Exchange during the currency of  the claim and the administration of Health (Cash) benefits would also be in the hands of Approved Societies as at present.  Under each scheme a form of declaration would be provided on the card so that the nature of the worker&apos;s occupation could be stated where Unemployment contributions were not payable.     11.  Under Schemes 1, 2 and 4 the worker would  be entitled to a receipt on his record card for both health and unemployment insurance contributions paid.  Under Scheme 3 the employer would be able to exchange cards  for all his workpeople in bulk.     12.  The reference under Schemes 1, 2 and 3 to dates of contributions is intended to indicate that where a card was only partially stamped the period covered by the stamps would  have to be stated.A advantages of A malgamated Systems.     13.  All these schemes  offer certain advantages to employers  or  employees or both, but they are open to objections of varying degree from the administrative or financial point  of view.  In the  following paragraphs the  main advantages  ordisadvantages of the schemes are first summarised on the assumption that the schemes are administratively practicable, and  then  the various difficulties which presentthemselves are examined.     14.  Under all the schemes, employers would only have one card to obtain, keepin safe custody and return, instead of two except in the case of employers havingonly domestic, or agricultural workers, &amp;c, who would be unaffected  by the change inthis respect.   Under Schemes 1, 2 and 3, the employer would only have to buy, affixand cancel one stamp instead  of two for the  majority of workers, although therewould often be certain individuals in his employment not liable to UnemploymentInsurance for  whom he would have to buy stamps at the Health rate.   On the otherhand,  owing to the wider  range of stamps  which  would result, e.g.,  from  the combination of  the unemployment rates of contributions  for  juveniles  and youngpersons with the normal health rate,  he would have to use greater care  than  atpresent in affixing the correct stamps.  Under Scheme 4, he  would only have to stampone card, but he would have to buy two stamps in most cases, the stamps being affixedin corresponding positions on the two halves  of the card, as is already done in thecase of workers of 65 and over.     15.  So far as the employee is concerned, he would only have one card to obtainat entry into insurance, and in cases where the employee exchanges his unemploymentbook personally at the commencement of each contribution period, he would be relieved of this duty.   Where, under  the proposed Schemes, a man was unemployed, he wroulc.be concerned only with one card which, normally, he would lodge at the Exchange,instead of two cards  as at present,  one  of which  he lodges at the exchange and the other he retains  and  presents weekly at the Exchange for &quot; franking,&quot; until he resumes work.  (Franking is the normal procedure  for proving unemployment tothe Approved  Society so that arrears may be excused for the weeks in question.)     16.  Under Schemes 1, 2  and 4, the employee would have the advantage  of seeing what contributions had been paid by the employer not only for health but also for Unemployment Insurance, and by obtaining a receipt on his record card he wouldhave a permanent record of both contributions  available for future reference.  Thiswould not only enable him to know whether his contributions entitled him to benefitbut also would serve as a check upon due compliance by the employer, who sometimestakes advantage of the fact  that the employee does not see the unemployment bookand evades payment of contributions in  consequence.   Scheme 3 would not offer thesame advantage, assuming that the card was returnable direct by the employers  to
Exchanges as under the present Unemployment Insurance system.   Indeed, it would deprive the employee of the corresponding advantage which already exists under the health and Pensions scheme  and would pro tanto conduce to non-compliance asregards Health Insurance.   On the other hand, under the Unemployment InsuranceScheme a large and increasing number of contributors do see their books (and havethe opportunity of seeing  that they are  stamped)  under the arrangements which require that the employee  shall give his latest address  immediately before  the surrender of the book.   Further, the employee can require to see his card wheneverhe likes, though the right is not often exercised.    17.  A further inducement  to  the due payment  of  contributions would beprovided under Schemes  1, 2 and 4 (and lost under  Scheme 3) by reason of the factthat the existing system of collection of cards by Approved Societies, whose agents ina large number of cases visit the members&apos;  homes for this purpose,  maintains a constant pressure on the employee to get his cards stamped by his employer, even if he himself is apathetic.  On the other  hand,  the system of  bulk  exchange  underUnemployment Insurance has advantages in ensuring compliance though they arenot so great as under the Health  Insurance Scheme.Administrative and Financial Diffictdties    18.  It is not practicable in this memorandum to explore all the complicationswhich the adojation of  any one of the schemes would introduce into the work of theMinistry of Labour and the Approved Societies, but in the following paragraphs the main difficulties presented by each scheme are set out seriatim.    19.  Scheme 1 involves the maintenance of  a combined contribution record bythe Approved  Societies, on which record the Ministry of Labour would have to  relywhen  the information  was required  in connection with a  claim for benefit.  Thiswould  seriously  complicate  the  administrative  machinery  of  unemploymentinsurance,  since there are approximately 7,000 Societies and branches keeping the records of contributions, and  any one  of the 1,200 Employment  Exchanges mightbe required to communicate with some  hundreds  of  Societies and Branches in orderto ascertain the contribution position  as affecting  the benefit rights of claimants,instead of  communicating,  as  at present, with one  central  Government Office.  to effect  the change it would be necessary to make difficult transitional arrangements to link up the present unemployment numbers  with the membership numbers inApproved Societies, and  to link up the present and future records.    20.  The  administration  of  Unemployment Insurance is complex, and it isnecessary that Exchanges shall be able to rely,  as  they can now, on the recording-department of the Ministry despatching the  certificate of contributions within notmore than 48 hours of receipt of the  application  for it.  Leaving aside  the questionwhether Approved Societies, wdiich  have whole-time  officers,  could  be relied upon for equally accurate and prompt attention to a service  in which they are not directly interested, the Ministry of Labour would not regard it as reasonable to rely on it from  the Societies and Branches which would have part-time officials.    21.  Delays would inevitably arise if the Exchange had instead to look to the,000  Societies and Branches  for these certificates and these would prejudice theposition of claimants for benefit, sometimes very  seriously.  The Ministry of labour would be embarrassed by complaints  (whether well or ill-founded), that the records of the Approved Societies are inaccurate.  Seeing that the  number of certificatesrequired is normally three to four million a year (60,000  a week,  rising suddenlyat times to 120,000 a week or more), it is obvious that  even a small percentage of delay  or error would present Government with an unmanageable problem.  Unem-ployment Insurance is now7, and will  for a long time, be a service attracting so much attention politically that Government cannot afford  the irritation which such  asystem would involve.    22.  Under existing legislation  it is necessary for the  Ministry  to ascertainin a large number of cases the precise weeks in which a claimants contributions were  paid, and  reference to the stamped cards  is required for the purpose.  the approved Societies could not furnish  such information  in most cases withoutkeeping in effect a detailed note of the stamps on cards sent to the  Ministry ofHealth, or referring to the actual cards stored by that Ministry.
     23.  Tor the  last  twelve  years  there have  been constant  changes  in  the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and many  changes  in the form and details of  the information  which the  central recording department  has to furnish.   With  the present system it is possible to effect  such changes easily and without  delay.  To have to make such changes in the form and  particulars of information furnished by Approved Societies would be a much more difficult process, introducing for a time at least new causes of inaccuracy and delay.     24.  As  to the future, the Ministry of Labour point out  that large  changes in Unemployment Insurance are not unlikely;  that it is probable that they will not all be made at one time, but that there will be a series;  that the question as to  what is the right policy is difficult in itself, and Government must have the fullest choice of alternatives; and that Government would not be in  this position if it were  limited to schemes which can be  worked through Approved Societies&apos; records.     25.  It  is by no  means  certain  or even  probable  that  the  scheme under examination  would  lead to economy.   The central recording department of  the Ministry of Labour has through the years been brought to  a high state of efficiency and it is managed economically on a mass production basis by using grades of staff appropriate to the  relatively simple operations, into which the matter can uD divided when organised on a large scale.   In  the case, however, of the  Approved Societies, except perhaps the largest of them, the organisation is different,  and  the cost to Approved  Societies as a whole of performing any services  now carried  out by the central recording department at Kew would  probably  be higher than to  the Ministry of Labour.  It would, too, still be necessary to maintain the central records (apart from  contributions) for purposes of check on identity of claimants&apos;  rate of benefit, &amp;c, and to refer to them before admitting a claim.  It  is these circumstances which makes it at least doubtful if any saving would result. .     26.  There is objection on financial grounds to making payment  out of  the Unemployment Fund on  secondary evidence, involving possible errors of  calculation and transcription, furnished by a body having no financial responsibility towards the Fund,  and over whom the Ministry  of Labour have no  control. Indeed,  the Ministry  could not  agree, as a matter of principle,  that the disbursement of a national fund of  50,000,000 (or  100,000,000) per annum should be made dependent for its primary records on 7,000 privately managed bodies.     27.  Scheme  2  involves  the  maintenance  of  two contribution records,&apos;  one compiled  by  the  Approved Societies from the actual  contribution cards and  the other by the Ministry of Labour from half-yearly notifications furnished by  the Societies.  From the Ministry of Labour point of  view this is  open to the same objection on  the score of secondary evidence as Scheme  1.  It would, moreover, add considerably  to the w-ork and  cost of the recording  department of the Ministry of Labour, since there would be two notifications a year to be handled  and posted to  the ledger sheets as compared with one yearly book.     28.  In  addition, the Approved Societies would be  faced  with  the colossal task of preparing and issuing 12 million notifications twice annually, which would more than double  their present work of recording contributions, and some delay would probably occur in  many cases.  Moreover, in the early autumn this would interfere seriously with their work of making up the arrears accounts of members and issuing arrears  notices, work which must be done within the  prescribed time in order to give the members  due opportunity of discharging their arrears.     20.  This  scheme,  therefore,  seems to be open to  strong objections, both  on financial and on practical grounds.     30.  Scheme 3 also  involves the maintenance of two contribution records,  but in this case the primary record would be compiled by the Ministry of Labour, and the secondary record by the Approved Societies from notifications furnished by  the Ministry of Labour at yearly intervals, or at such other times  as might be required. This would add greatly  to the cost of the recording department of the Ministry of Labour,  which would not only  have to prepare notifications for  the 12 millions insured against unemployment, but also to prepare such notifications or transmit  theactual cards  for the further 4 millions for whom they have no responsibility under
 the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Special and elaborate arrangements would have to be devised to supply the Ministry of Labour with the Approved Society particulars of both these classes, and all notifications or cards would have to reach the Societies immediately after the end  of  the contribution year, so that they could enter  their Contribution  Registers,  make  the  arrears  calculations  (after  taking  account of sickness already recorded in other Registers) and issue the arrears notices by the end of  September.  This would involve a considerable  increase in the staff  of the Ministry of Labour.  Special arrangements would also have to be made for the issue of  cards  to   agricultural  workers, &amp;c,  otherwise than  through Employment Exchanges, which are often not accessible in such cases.     31.   From the Approved Society  point of  view the scheme is open,  mutatis: mutandis,  to the same financial objection on the score of secondary evidence  as is noted above, though the force of the objection is less when the primary  records are kept by a Government Department instead of a voluntary body.   Furthermore, it is entirely foreign to the Approved Society system, depending, as this system does,  upon frequent contact with the members, without which many insured persons would find themselves out of touch with their  Societies when they had occasion to apply for benefits.  This contact  would be greatly reduced by the receipt  of cards yearly instead of half-yearly, and in the many cases where cards are at present issued and collected personally, it would be lost altogether under a system under which the cards (or equivalent  notifications) were received through the employers and the Ministry of Labour.  Apart, therefore, from other factors, such  as the inducement to  com- compliance on the part of employers which is afforded by the system of collection through Approved  Societies, this scheme seems to be open to insuperable objections from the Health Insurance aspect.    32.  Scheme 4 differs in important respects  from the other  three.  It involves separate records of contributions, compiled respectively by the Ministry of Labour and  the  Approved Societies, but each  derived from the actual contribution card, which would be divided for this purpose into two  halves.   Assuming, therefore, that the Approved Societies could be counted  upon to sever the two halves immediately upon collecting the card and to send the  unemployment  portion  to the Ministry of Labour, there would appear to be no objection to this Scheme on the score of delay or of the reliability of the contribution record available to the Ministry.  The record would be primary, and not secondary as  in the other schemes.    33.  Certain  administrative difficulties, however, immediately  present them- selves.   In  the first place, the  card would be  half-yearly,  partly  because it  is impracticable  to provide a  card with spaces for more than 6 months&apos; health and unemployment  insurance stamps, and partly because a half-yearly card is peculiarly suited to the Approved  Society system.  This involves the additional work in the recording department of the Ministry of Labour, which has already been noted, viz., the handling and  posting of two cards yearly instead of one.    It is  true that the Employment Exchanges  would be relieved  of the  task  of  issuing  and receiving unemployment  books, but the  corresponding service performed by  the Approved Societies would have to be remunerated,  and  even if  it be  assumed that this remuneration, on the basis of a joint service,  would be less than  the  present cost at the Employment Exchanges, it  is unlikely that any such saving would offset, or even approach, the extra costs of the Ministry of Labour recording department.  In this connection it should be pointed out  that before making the new duties a statutory obligation  upon Approved Societies and before settling the appropriate remunera- tion, it would be necessary to obtain their concurrence through the medium of the Consultative Council on Approved Societies&apos; Work or otherwise.    34.  The second difficulty is lhat of associating the present Unemployment  book numbers with  the  Approved  Society membership  numbers.   It would clearly be necessary for the Societies to ascertain the book numbers of their  members who were insured against unemployment, so  that they could  insert these  numbers, together with the member&apos;s name, and  possibly  his  address, on the Unemployment portion of the card.  At the initial stage and before the Scheme actually came into operation. it would be necessary to devise some special plan  (possibly in  co-operation with employers) whereby the book numbers were transferred to the health insurance cards,or the insured persons supplied with identification cards, by which the number could
be conveyed to their Approved Societies.  After the initial stage the difficulty wouldbe confined to new entrants into insurance, who would have to attend at EmploymentExchanges for the purpose  of  completing application forms and receiving booknumbers, which they would then notify to their Approved Societies, unless it werearranged for these processes to be carried out through the agency of the Societies.    35.  Further, as has been  previously pointed out, the  books at  present bearclassification letters and numbers for the purpose of obtaining statistics.  Theseare put on originally at the time of first issue, and at each annual exchange of booksthis classification is carefully examined, and reclassification, where  necessary, ismade according to the industry in which the contributor is now working, or, if he isunemployed, according  to  the industry in which  he  last worked.   The  work ofclassification is highly technical in character.  Approved Societies have no interestwhatever in the industry to which a worker belongs,  and if the joint cards were issued through the machinery which now  issues Health and Pensions cards, it is unlikely that  the classification  would be uniformly or adequately performed.  Itseems essential that before issue  the joint card should be supplied to an employment exchange, in order that it might be properly classified and the  statistics compiled.It would be necessary to provide means by which a record could be made of the jointcards issued in respect  of contributors in each of the Employment Exchange areas(or equivalent local  government areas),  in  order  that  the  statistics  of  localunemployment now available under the present system could be continued.    36.  Before a scheme could be introduced, certain other questions would need to be disposed  of,  e.g., what action (if any) the Approved Societies would be requiredto take where  the unemployment portion of the card was not stamped to correspond with the health portion, and whether they should keep any summary record of  thestamped cards forwarded by them to the  Ministry  of Labour.  No detailed recordis at present kept by the Employment Exchanges, but it would be for consideration whether a similar plan  could be adopted in  the case of Approved Societies, seeing that the officials of those bodies would not be under the direct control of the Ministry.On the  other  hand, the receipt  given to the member on his record card would beavailable as evidence of the  payment of contributions in the event of the  unemploy-ment portion of a card being lost after collection.                               -    37.  General. There  are certain complications common to  some  or all of  theschemes.  Thus, schemes 1, 2 and 3, involving the use of joint stamps, would requirethe stocking of several new  denominations of stamps at Post Offices, in addition tothe separate health and unemployment stamps which would still be  required  forspecial classes; and all  four schemes raise problems as to  the treatment of specialgroups of insured persons, such as foreign-going seamen (for whom health contribu-tions  are at present paid in cash under a schedule system), juveniles and young-persons, exempt persons, persons covered on the  unemployment side of the special schemes for the insurance and banking industries, persons covered on the health side by certificates  of exception, although insured against unemployment, and so on.APPENDIX HI.  NOTE BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY ON THE FINANCIAL EFFECT OF RAISING THE     SICKNESS BENEFIT UNDER NATIONAL HEALTH  INSURANCE TO THE RATES OF                          UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE.    1.  This note  relates to men only.   Time has not permitted of  the preparationof estimates as to women.    2.  It is assumed, firstly, that the sickness benefit only would  be raised to thefull rates of unemployment insurance benefit and  that after 26 weeks of incapacitythe benefit  would be  reduced  by  one-half, as at  present  (disablement  benefit).Reference is subsequently made to the cost of abolishing  disablement benefit and continuing sickness  benefit  at the full  rates throughout  the whole duration  of incapacity, as recommended  in  the Minority Report of the Royal  Commission  on national Health Insurance.       [22049]                                                          G
     3.  The present sickness benefit is 15s. a week.  Unemployment benefit in the case of an unmarried man of full age is 17s. a week and for a man and wife is 26s. with 2s. a week extra for each  child under 14.  (In view of the proposals of the Education Bill this age is taken  as 15).   The increase of sickness benefit in the ease of a married man with 2 children would thus be 15s. a week, the present benefit being doubled.  Even where there are  no young children the benefit would be increased by 11s. a week.  The first point requiring consideration is the probable  effect of these increases on  the number and duration  of  the claims.  As a  large proportion  probably, indeed, a substantial majority of the men covered by the National Health Insurance scheme are also insured for sickness  benefits of amounts varying between 10s. and 20s.  a week as members of Friendly Societies and Trade Unions  the effect of increasing  the  health insurance benefits to the  unemployment insurance rates would be to bring up the total income during sickness to full wages (in some  cases, e.g., agriculture, considerably more than full  wages)  in the  case  of a very large section of the insured population.  It is impossible to assume that such a condition would have no influence on the sickness claims, and that these would remain at their present level.   As I showed in  my recent report on the subject (Cmd.  3548) the sickness claims of  men rose  by over 40 per cent,  between 1921 and 1927,  and it is taking a moderate  view to assume that  with the benefits raised to the unemployment insurance rates the claims would  be permanently about 10 per cent, in excess of those of 1927.  The increase in the claims for disablement benefit has  been more rapid and in this case it seems necessarv to  provide for a permanent excess of 20 per cent, over the level of  1927.     4.  The wife&apos;s allowance  in the case of unemployment insurance is only paid where she is dependent on her husband.   It is presumed that the  same limitation would be applied in the case of health insurance and that where the wife was herself an insured wage-earner no allowance would be paid to the husband when he was incapacitated.   On the average this would diminish the sickness benefit of a married man from 26s. a week to rather  less than 25s.   In the subjoined estimates I have treated this  reduction as a  further margin against increase  of claims.  In this connection it has to be borne in mind that  the reduction would be very  unevenly distributed  over the various  approved societies,  and that some of them, notably those connected with the mining and agricultural industries, would derive practically nothing from a  condition withholding dependants&apos; benefit  from a wife who was herself insured.  Much, indeed, of the relief under this head would be concentrated in the societies whose members are engaged in the textile industry.     5.  The estimated effect of  the increase of sickness benefits to the unemploy- ments  rates, in  the case  of  men, and  taking disablement benefit  at one-half  the sickness benefit, is as follows :       (i) The  cost  of sickness and disablement  benefits (exclusive of  additional          benefits)   would  be  increased  from   about   10,000,000  yearly  to          approximately  20,000,000.     (ii) If the extra cost, were met by increasing the contributions, the Exchequer          grant remaining at one-seventh of the expenditure,  the contributions of          employers and workers would be increased from  the present rate of          9d.  a week to Is. 3d. a week.    The yearly increase  in the Exchequer          grant would be  1,400,000.     (iii) If the weekly  contributions  were retained  at the  present rate,  the          Exchequer paying the cost of  all benefits in excess of the present rates,          in addition to its contribution of one-seventh to the cost of  the present          benefits, the increase  in the Exchequer grant would be over  8,000,000          a year.     6.  It is particularly to be noted with reference to (iii) that, even  though  the liability of the approved societies would be limited to the provision of benefits at  the existing rates, the cost of these benefits would be increased in direct proportion to any  increase of  the  claims resulting from the extension of the benefits.   If  the moderate assumptions which  I  have made in regard to this point  (see paragraph 3) should be realised, the grant of additional benefits, treatment as well as cash, would have to be discontinued on the  expiry of the  present schemes (if not before) in the case of the great majority of societies, and their surpluses applied, as long as they lasted,  to meet  the strain of the extra claims.  In those cases in which thesurplus is inconsiderable, deficiency would speedily appear, and the present arrange-ments under which it has hitherto been possible to make good a deficiency through
 the  instrumentality of a  small  central fund, without  requiring  the  members  to submit to reduction of benefits or increase of contributions, would  prove altogether inadequate.  The system would, in fact, be confronted by the prospect of widespread insolvency, and I should be compelled, accordingly, to advise that, even if the rates of benefit payable from the funds of approved societies were not increased (the whole of the extra weekly allowances  being provided by the  Exchequer), some increase should be made in the joint contribution of the employers and workers to the funds of the societies.     7.   If the reduction from sickness benefit to disablement benefit were abolished and  the  allowances continued throughout the whole duration of incapacity at the benefit rates of unemployment  insurance, it is certain that a heavy increase in the number  and duration of  protracted claims would set  in.  In my recent  report (Cmd. 354S) I showed that among a representative  sample of the insured population, 55 per cent, of those who exhausted their sickness benefit in 1927 and went on  to disablement benefit &quot; declared off &quot; the funds before the year ended; and the further fact was brought out that of those who thus went off benefit 50 per cent, resumed work within 4 weeks after being reduced to the disablement rate and 70 per cent. within 8 weeks.   These remarkable figures can only be attributed to  one thing, namely, the incentive to work created by the reduction of the amount of benefit from the sickness rate to the disablement  rate, and if  this incentive should be removed a mass  of  claims  which arc now terminated within a  few  months of their  onset must be expected  to  drift  into permanence.   The  consequent  drain upon the insurance funds is only one  of the evils to be feared from  such a result;  another, and certainly not a less serious one, is the resulting  injury to the morale and, in many cases, to the actual health of the persons concerned.     8.   The extent of the increase in the duration of the claims to be anticipated from such  a change  in  the benefits must be purely conjectural,  and  I have not attempted to put a measure on it.  Taking the level of the future claims, therefore, as indicated at the end of paragraph 3,  it is found that if the incapacity benefits  of National Health Insurance were raised to the rates of unemployment insurance and continued at these rates  throughout the whole duration of incapacity, the total expenditure on benefit during incapacity wrould be raised from  10 millions a year to E26-?T millions a  year.  The equivalent increase of contributions would be from the present  9d.  to about Is. Q^d. (weekly).    9.   In  view  of  the  considerable  risk  that the  suggested  expenditure  of  26-J- millions would  be exceeded, the  question of the  necessary  addition to the present State grant presents much difficulty.  It appears to me that  without the help afforded  by the automatic reduction of sickness benefit when it has been paid for 26 weeks, the approved societies would be quite unable to bear the responsibility for the provision of allowances throughout the whole  duration of incapacity, with the assistance,  only, of a  proportionate  State grant  such  as the  present  one.   It  is probable that the liability of the societies would have to be limited to the first sixor twelve  months of  incapacity,  the  State then assuming  the wrhole burden, presumably with the  aid  of an assigned part of  the contribution charged jointly upon the employers and the workers.APPENDIX  IV.                 THE NEW  SCHEME OF VOLUNTARY INSURANCE.     1.  The following is a summary of the scheme recommended for adoption :  (i) The scheme is to be open  to uninsured persons with incomes  not exceeding  400         a year (as  assessed for income tax purposes).     In addition, any insured person who ceases to be insurably employed  and is entitled to become an ordinary voluntary contributor to have the alternative option of becoming a special contributor at the rate appropriate to initial entrants.     The  form of  insurance provided by the  Contributory Pensions  Act  is ofparticular value to  persons of small or moderate incomes (and especially  to married men  among this class), but it cannot be obtained through any insurance company orother voluntary organisation.  It is considered, therefore, that the scheme should be offered to all persons at present not entitled  to  be insured under the State scheme       [22049]                                                        G 2
whose  income is  such  as  to  preclude the payment of premiums for ordinary lifeassurance on the heavy scale that would make a substantial provision for a dependentfamily.  For this purpose the figure of  400 has been selected.  Where there is ajoint income of husband  and wife it is the joint income, that is,  the income nowadopted  for income tax  purposes, which will  have to be taken  into account in determining whether the income is within the maximum limit of  400.(ii) For entrants  in the initial period the rates of contribution to be:  Men,  Is. 3d.         a week;  Women, 7%d.  a -week.     The  rate of Is.  3d.  compares with the compulsory  rate  of  Sd. Even with considerable assistance from the Exchequer, it is necessary to charge a substantially greater contribution for voluntary insurance than is required under  a compulsoryscheme, for the voluntary scheme must be expected to attract a preponderance of married men with families, while, in enforcing payment upon the whole population,the compulsory scheme sweeps in from the earliest insurable age some millions of theunmarried of both sexes.   As indicated above, the suggested contribution will not of itself support&apos; the benefits.  We have fixed it by reference (a) to the amount whichit may be taken that the average person of the class for whom the scheme is designedcan afford to pay, and (b) the measure of State assistance which was given underthe compulsory scheme to initial  entrants.     As regards the contribution  for women, who will be interested only in the old age pension, a lower rate will be  appropriate, and, following the precedent of thePensions  Act of 1925,  half the suggested normal rate, or 7\d., is proposed.(iii) The  initial period for entry at the flat rate of contribution to  be two years.(iv)  For entrants in the initial period the maximiim age for entry  to be 55.     This will ensure  that at least ten years&apos; contributions are paid for  old  age pension at 65.(v)  For entrants  after the initial  period the maximum age for  entry to be 40, and         the contributions to  be graduated according to age  at entry, rising for  a         man from Is. 3d. at age 20 to 3s. at age 40.     The rates of  contributions suggested start at Is. 3d. for a man under age 21 atentry and increase generally by Id. for each later year of age at entry until, at themaximum age of entry of 40, the contribution  is 3s. a week.   These  rates of con-tributions, although they will not cover the value of  the  benefits in all individual cases,  approximate closely to the weekly  contributions  necessary  to support thebenefits up  to the age of 70 in  the case of married men  with  average families asregards age of wife and number of children.(vi)  The  benefits to  be the ordinary benefits of  the present pensions  scheme,  with         a graded scale of pensions or its equivalent, according  to  the  average         number  of  contributions paid,  to meet  cases of  irregular contribution         payment.(vii) A special voluntary  contributor  (other than a married woman) to be given the         option of also  becoming a  voluntary contributor  for  health  insurance         purposes at the ordinary rate  of contribution.     An entrant in the initial period could become insured  for both health insurance and pensions at a joint contribution of 2s. a  week for a man and Is. 4f/. for a woman.(viii) The special scheme  of voluntary insurance  for  pensions  purposes  to  be         administered centrally, the contribution records being kept by the Ministry         of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland.The Cost of the Scheme.     2.  It is highly probable that so far as men are concerned the suggested scheme would only appeal to married men. For the purpose of giving some rough indication of the numbers who may be eligible to enter the  scheme, we have been informed thatthe estimated number of married men of all ages under 55 with incomes  not exceeding 400, to whom the scheme would be applicable, may be put at 1,350,000.
     3.  Experience of pension schemes on a voluntary basis and, in particular, the1 results of the offer made by the Act of  1925 to uninsured persons  who had at one time been under the compulsory scheme,  lead to the conclusion that  a comparatively small proportion of the 2^persons to whom a scheme of voluntary insurance might be offered would avail themselves of it.  For the purposes of estimates it is assumed that the number of entrants at the outset would be 300,000, and that these would be married men.     4.  Estimates of the  age distribution of entrants must necessarily be  wholly conjectural, but for the purposes of estimates the work has been limited to two,  (a) a &quot; normal &quot;  age distribution of married men of the classes to which the scheme may be expected to appeal, as obtained with  the aid of the last census, and (b) a distri- bution based on the same  material but adjusted by assuming that  the scheme will not appeal to men under 30 but will attract an abnormal proportion of married men at the  middle ages.  Comparison of the results will give some idea of the differences in the  cost of the scheme with reference to even a modest variation in the  element of age.     5.   It has been assumed  that contributors whose wives die will continue their connection with the scheme, although this is a doubtful assumption.     6.   An aggregate charge of 50 per cent, above the &apos;&apos; normal &apos;&apos; for  men likely to be attracted to the scheme has been assumed so far as concerns the liability in respect of children.     7.   The calculations have been  restricted to the 300,000 married men assumed to enter the scheme at the outset, thus including nothing in respect of future entrants.     8.   In dealing with the liability for old age pension at  70, some  assumption has to be made as to the extent to which the persons in the class (including the wives and  widows of contributors) would in any case obtain the  pension by satisfying the means  test under the existing Acts.   While all pensions beginning at 65,  and all widows&apos; pensions, will be continued at 70, the extra liability under this head is only the cost of the cases in which it would be impossible  for the claimants to establish a right to  pension under the present Acts.    General considerations suggest  that probably one-half of the recipients of pension under  the scheme would satisfy the means  test and obtain pensions at 70 under the  Acts of 1908-24.  It has, therefore,been assumed that the new liability  under this head represents the  cost of pensions for one-half only of those who reach  the age of 70.     9.   Expenses of administration have been put clown at  50,000 a year.   this a wholly conjectural figure.     10.  The following are the present values of the items entering  into the charge,and  of the contributions.     11.  The difference  between  the present value of the benefits and that of thecontributions, called the Net Liability, is the present equivalent of all the sums which,over a long series  of years, the Government would  have to  furnish to meet thedifference between the cost  of benefits and the contributions paid.     12.  The figures under (a) and (b) refer  respectively  to the  alternative  agedistributions so lettered in paragraph 4.

     14.  The first of these tables indicates that if the age distribution were as in (a) the contributions would be more than the outgo up to about the end of 1941, and that a fund would be accumulated which (with interest) might amount  to about 7 million pounds.  After 1941 the  position  would be reversed, outgo would exceed income, the  fund  would  be  speedily absorbed, and  from about the end of 1948 onwards the Exchequer would have to meet  an annual deficiency.   This  deficiency would reach its maximum about 1960, and thereafter would  diminish.  The second table, relating  to an age  distribution as in  (b), is to be similarly interpreted.  In considering these figures,  it should  not be overlooked that in offering the  scheme to nearly H millions of  possible contributors,  Parliament would be  faced with  the risk of having to meet liability of much greater amount than they suggest.     15.  It is for  consideration whether  the Exchequer liability (other than that in respect of pensions to persons of 70 years of age and upwards) should not be met by something in the nature of an equalised  annual charge, spread over 30 or 40 years. By the Contributory  Pensions Act, 1929,  Parliament took a considerable step in this direction, so far as the  existing  system is  concerned,  by  raising  the Exchequer charge immediately  from  4 millions  yearly  to   9, and  by providing for its automatic increase by  1 million a year to a maximum of   21 millions in 1942. This increase was made despite the fact that a Fund of over  40 millions was in existence, and  it  gave  substantial recognition  to  the  principle that Parliament, when granting benefits involving  a growing charge,  should  make  such  provision for their cost as would more  or less equalise the burden and not leave the greater part of it to be met by the taxpayers of the future.  If a term of 30 years were adopted the annual charge under (a) would be about  1,000,000, and  under (b) about  1,250,000.  It should be made clear that these figures do not include the additional cost of old age pensions at the age 70, which would  be chargeable to the  Old  Age Pensions Vote, and the amount of which, under (&amp;), for example,  would be about  800,000 in  1951, rising to  about  1,800,000 in 1961, and thereafter gradually diminishing.    16.  The Exchequer charge in respect of widows&apos;  and orphans&apos; pensions  and old age pensions between  65  and 70, if equalised, would be subject, in  practice, to two  important considerations.   It would   not  be  known,  when  the  Bill  w*as introduced, how many persons would avail themselves of the offer, or how they would be distributed in  regard to age and family responsibilities;   and until the scheme had been some  time in operation it would not be possible to estimate the  probable number of lapses  among those who came in and began to contribute.  It would be necessary, therefore,  to put in a provisional figure  as the Exchequer charge  at  the outset, giving powder to the Treasury to revise it so soon as conditions permitted of a reliable estimate as to what the real charge was likely to be.    17.  The above estimates relate solely to an assumed number of 300,000 married men  entrants.  As women entrants will  become insured solely for  the purpose of securing  old age  pensions at age 65,  it is  unlikely that many  under 40 will be attracted to  the scheme.  It  is estimated that the number  of unmarried women between the  ages of 40 and 55 who are not already insured is about 750,000, and the maximum number eligible for admission would be  those of this  number  whose incomes were within  the limit of  400.  We are doubtful if 20,000 would choose to enter  the scheme,  as the  general experience of insurance companies, of  friendly societies and of the State is that few people Avill buy annuities alone.    18.  It  is not possible to make any  estimates as to the  cost of the scheme in respect of entrants after the initial period of two years.  As explained in an earlier paragraph,  the different rates of  contributions  approximate  closely to  thecontributions necessary to support the scheme so far as concerns all the benefits up to the age of 70 for married men with average families.
       PARTIAL POOLING OF VALUATION SURPLUSES OF APPROVED SOCIETIES.     1.  The question of the inequalities of benefit in different Approved Societieswas one of the major  problems with  which  the Royal Commission on national health Insurance  had to deal, and it is accordingly desirable that prominence begiven to their considered views on this aspect of the national health insurance system.The following extracts are taken from Chapter IX of the Royal Commission Reportpublished in 1926 :      &quot; 245. We now come to the main ground on which the Approved Society system,as it now exists, has been attacked by many of the witnesses who gave evidence onthe subject, namely,  the serious inequalities of benefit to which the system gives rise.It  has already been explained that  under the scheme laid down in  1911,  and continued to  the present date,  each Approved  Society is a separate financial unit,controlling its own  funds and standing to gain or  lose as the result  of its own experience.  Any surplus found in  the funds of a Society on valuation can be usedsolely for the benefit of the members of that Society.  Although the Act provides fora flat  rate of  contribution from members of  all Societies,  there has been a widevariation in the amounts of the surpluses in  different Societies on valuation.  As aresult of the first valuation as at the end of 1918, some Societies were still unable togive anything more than the normal statutory benefits, while others had sufficiently large surpluses to enable  them to provide  their members not only with  substantial increases of the normal cash benefits, but also with valuable additional benefits in thenature of treatment.     We are  not  surprised  that these  great  disparities should have  occasioneddisappointment and dissatisfaction in certain  quarters,  and that they should  haveprovoked  keen criticism of the  present system.Causes of Surplus.     &quot; 247. The emergence of a surplus  on valuation is due to a great variety ofcauses, some within and others  outside the  control of the Society.  We propose here,however, to refer  only  to those two possible  causes which were most  frequentlymentioned in evidence before us.   The first is the segregation within a  Society oflives much above or much below the general average as regards liability to sickness.For example, a Society composed mainly of rural workers could hardly fail to showa much more favourable  result on valuation than a  Society composed  mainly of chemical workers.  The second cause of surplus which was constantly  quoted inevidence was  careful administration, particularly as  regards the supervision of claims for benefit.  Undoubtedly, good administration must be a contributing causeto a satisfactory valuation result, even if it is thought that, when compared with theother cause to which we have referred,  it has been but a minor factor.   We should like to make it clear that in advancing this  proposition we are in no way lending our support to any suggestion that  good administration is relatively unimportant.  Butwe  are inclined to think that,  even if it were possible hypothetically to  assume a uniform standard of administration  throughout all Societies, the discrepancieswhich  would have  resulted would have been almost as great as those which have, infact, emerged, and we are strengthened in  this view by the consideration  that thereare prosperous Societies  in which administration is not  strict and unfortunateSocieties which are unfortunate despite strictness of supervision.&quot;Results of Segregation.     &quot; 248. The evidence which we  have received on this matter has inclined to oneor other of two extremes, each of which can be supported by arguments of some force,but neither of which, as we shall show later, commends itself to us.  On the one side,it has been represented that the position wdiich has now revealed itself as the resultof the first two valuations was only to  be expected and was  clearly  foreseen and explained and  defended in the most definite terms when the scheme of national health Insurance was first before Parliament in 1911.  Our attention has been called
 to various statements, in Parliament and elsewhere,  by responsible Ministers and others,  containing pledges that every Society would have complete control over its own funds, and that any advantage arising out of  a favourable valuation of those fimds would be confined to the members of the Society.  In opposition to this view, the extremists of the other school of thought maintain that in a national  system of insurance, which derives its funds from contributions  compulsorily payable  by the insured and their employers, there should be uniform benefits for all.     &quot; 249. In the pursuit of our task of reviewing the whole Scheme of National Health Insurance and considering what changes are  desirable with a view to making the Scheme of the greatest possible benefit to the insured community, we cannot take the view that we are limited by the necessity of adhering to any particular principles on which the Scheme was originally set up, or by any statements which were made at the time of the inception of the Scheme in explanation or in defence  of the provisions contained in the original Bill. On the contrary, we hold that the National Health Insurance Scheme was in the nature of a great and novel experiment  in the field of  social welfare, and that it must now be open to Parliament, untrammelled and  unfettered,  to review the whole Scheme in the light of 13 years&apos; experience of its working and to make such changes, however drastic, as that experience may have shown to be desirable. Justification for Variations in Benefits.     &quot; 253. After the most careful consideration of the subject, we have come to the conclusion that with  a flat rate of contribution from all insured persons,  whatever their liability to sickness, the provision of varying benefits can be justified.  We are impressed by the fact that the inequality of experience between different Societies is accompanied by a  considerable inequality in wTages.  For example, agricultural workers, who receive lower wages  than the average artisans,  show better results tinder National Health  Insurance.  It was  mainly on  the ground that agricultural workers  are  on  the  whole less liable to sickness  than persons engaged in other occupations that a demand was made on their  behalf  in 1911  for a lower rate of contribution, and it  wras chiefly on the ground of the  administrative  difficulties of differentiation in the rate of  contribution that  this demand was resisted.  At the same time it was pointed  out that  by grouping themselves  in special  Societies agricultural workers  would be able  substantially  to attain the same ends, as they would thereby reap the  advantages of their light  sickness experience  in additional benefits, which might take the form of return of contributions.  It is perhaps worthy of notice  that the claims of  the  agricultural population to be  conceded a reduced rate  of contribution have again been put forward.     &quot;254. Another  justification  for differentiation  in benefits lies in the  incentivewhich is thereby offered to good and  careful administration.   We think that itwould be  fatal, both  administratively and financially, if the persons charged withthe responsibility for  considering claims for benefit felt that there was nothing to be gained by doing their work well  and thoroughly. Scheme to Mitigate Inequalities of Benefit.     &quot;255. While we cannot support the proposal for differential contributions, we have come to the conclusion that the possibility of the existence  of differences in the rate of benefits provided by  different Societies should continue to be a feature of  the  scheme of  National Ilealth  Insurance.  We  believe,  moreover, that the inequalities are only such as could have been and were foreseen in 1911  by  those whose technical knowledge and experience enabled  them to gauge the probabilities. It is true that as a result  of  the War the actual  surpluses  are larger  and the additional benefits greater  and more widely  distributed  than could  have  been anticipated;  in addition, the whole picture is drawn on a  larger scale as the result of the increase in rates of contribution and benefit which were made after the War in view of the change in money  values.     &quot;What  we are concerned with, however,  in this connexion is the degree of divergence from the average that is shown by particular Societies, and this is  quite unaffected  by the circumstances mentioned.  Indeed, such  changes as have  come about since the scheme  was originally framed have operated to reduce the relativeinequalities.  We refer  in particular to the establishment of the Contingencies fund and the  Central Fund, the purpose of which was to protect the Societies in deficiency      [22049]                                                          H
 from suffering either  reduction of benefits or increase of contributions.  We have emphasised these considerations because the demand for some measure of pooling of surpluses is often founded as we have shown, erroneously upon the theory that experience has in this respect falsified the expectations entertained by the authors of the Scheme  and held out by  them to the public at its  inception.  Although, however, this theory is shown to be untenable, there remains,  in our opinion, matter for serious consideration in the large gulf which now divides the most prosperous from the least prosperous Societies as  respects the standard  of benefits which they are in a position to provide for  their  members.  We have  shown  that on a cold analysis the inequalities that exist can be justified.  But in this matter, if we may appiy a much-quoted judicial aphorism, it is not sufficient that justice should in fact be done; it is equally  important that the public should realise that it is being done; and we are satisfied  that  on grounds  of broad policy it is desirable that  some concession should be made to the feeling, which we believe to  be widely entertained, that in a universal compulsory scheme of insurance to which a substantial contribu- tion is made from the general resources of the State some element of mutual aid should be included, by which the more  fortunate sections of the insured community will be enabled to contribute out of their abundance towards  the needs of those less happily placed.  These considerations, taken by themselves, would incline us to view with  favour the introduction of  a measure  of  partial equalisation of benefits so limited in  its operation as  to preserve the incentives  to  sound  and economical administration on  which we have laid stress above, but at the same time going considerably beyond the restricted scheme of  pooling  which was introduced, so far as Societies actually in deficiency are concerned, by the establishment of the Central Fund;  and we find that they are powerfully reinforced by the further consideration that such a measure would set free additional resources that could be applied in the provision of extended benefits which are greatly needed, and which, to be effective, should be provided for the whole insured community.  We  accordingly adopt the principle that the surpluses of Approved Societies should in part be  pooled, and we proceed to detailed proposals for giving effect to our recommendation.&quot;     &quot;256.  We consider that the Surplus funds which have accrued to  any Society at the  date  when the changes which  we recommend are brought into operation, together with any further  interest  accuring to those funds,  should  remain the absolute property of  the Society, and  that  the proposals  for  the mitigation  of inequality which we  put forward should be limited to surplus earned after the change of  system.....   The balance  of surplus would be the  amount actually earned in  the quinquennium,  and this is the sum which we propose  to treat  as subject to pooling.....&quot;    &apos;&apos; 257. The  proportion  of this surplus which should  be  brought into the pool would clearly have to  be  substantial, since otherwise  the  pooling scheme would be ineffective.  On the other hand, the proportion left with the Societies would also have to be substantial if the incentive to good administration is not to be weakened.  Our conclusion, therefore, is that the proportion should be one-half, a proportion which could also be defended on the ground that one-half of the contributions out of which the surplus arises is paid not by the members themselves but by their employers.  The pooling of one-half of  the surplus  acquired would have the same effect broadly  as if the employers&apos; contributions were carried to a central fund and one-half of all the benefits and other charges paid thereout -a plan which might with some measure of justification have been adopted  from the beginning.&quot;    &quot;258. We recommend that the amount paid into  the pool should be distributed among all Societies at a flat rate per head of membership.  We think that this would be the only satisfactory method of distribution since if the money were used simply to subsidise the  weaker Societies,  it might have the effect of  raising some of them to a better position than that of some of the Societies contributing to  the pool.&quot;    2.  The range of  divergence  in the surpluses of  societies is illustrated by the following tables.  The &quot;unit&quot;  in these tables is the equivalent  of a combinedaddition of Is. to the weekly rate of sickness benefit, Qd. to that of disablement benefit and 2s. to maternity benefit.

Under the first valuation nothing  was available for  treatment benefits in addition to the cash          increases shown in the above table.       Under  the  second  valuation  varying annual amounts, as  shown in the separate table, were          available for treatment benefits in addition to the above increases.
     4.  Out of the second valuation surpluses over 50  per cent, of  the  insured population were covered by schemes giving 3 or more cash units, and schemes covering over 4,000,000 insured  persons in England alone actually gave  5 or  more units of cash increases.  In addition in England a total sum a year of roughly  3f millions was made available for treatment  benefits,  5-1  times  as  much as under the first valuation.   Yet there was  still a substantial proportion of the insured population entitled only to the normal benefits or to the minimum cash increases of one unit.     5.  It should  be explained that the 3rd Valuation  will not be finally completed until near the end of 1931,  but so far as third valuation results have  been received, it seems clear that  although the average surplus per member may not be much reduced the differences between  societies will be found to be accentuated.  Of  the reports so far received which relate only to 2 million insured persons, out of 742 reports relating to centralised societies; 396 societies  (or just over half) having about 570,000 members are able to increase their additional  benefit allocations by 23 per cent.;  100 Societies having about 186,000 members can maintain their existing  schemes; 246 Societies (or one third) having  435,000 members  suffer a reduction of 31  per  cent.    In a branch Friendly Society it is found that  1,170 branches out of 1,797 with disposable surpluses (or 65  per cent.) can increase their present schemes by 54  percent., 263 can maintain them and 364 branches having  about 140,000 members mustreduce them by 47  per cent.    These results cannot be taken as a reliable indication of the results of the totalvaluation  when completed,  but they  serve to illustrate  the growing  divergencesbetween Societies.                   . *6.

The following examples from the other end of the scale show the very substantial additional benefits which members of fortunate societies will enjoy under their thirdvaluation schemes.    (a)  Members  of  the  Cambridge  General  Approved Society  (largely  rural          workers) will have their sickness benefit  increased to 22s.  Qd.  a week;          money is also available  to provide payments during convalescence, pay-          ment to those  in  want or distress, dental treatment,  payment  towards          hospital treatment,  surgical  appliances, ophthalmic  treatment  and          payments to charitable institutions in  respect of treatment of members.    (&amp;)  The Manchester Warehousemen and Clerks&apos; Approved Society, under their          scheme, will give sickness benefit at the rate of 25s. a week, in addition to          nearly all of the treatment benefits detailed in (a).    (c)  Members of the Sussex Rural Workers&apos;  Approved Society will have their          sickness benefit increased to 22s.  Qd. a week, the whole of the employees&apos;          part  of the weekly  contribution will under the scheme be  returned to          the members, and  all the  treatment benefits detailed in (a) are available.          There is still  473 a year not allocated out of the surplus.    (d)  The members of the London  and Provincial Printers&apos; Approved Society will          receive  when sick  22s. a  week or 17s. Qd. for women, and,  in addition,          nearly all forms of treatment benefit will be available to members.
    7.  With the exception of the Trades Union group of Approved Societies, thereis opposition from Approved Societies generally against any degree of pooling.  Theopposition comes most markedly from the Industrial Assurance group, the friendly societies and the rural Societies.    It should be noted that in some Friendly Societies with branches, views have been expressed in favour of eliminating the disparities within the Society  by interbranchpooling.    It is argued by the opponents of pooling that the original plan  under which a flat rate of contribution was fixed and Societies were made independent units, con-templated that surpluses  would be earned and would be applied for the benefit ofthe members and that any attempt now. to take away part of these surpluses would amount to a breach of faith.   They also argue that the incentive to good and  carefuladministration  would  largely disappear  if the members  were deprived  of the enjoyment of the moneys which to some  extent good management had earned.Further, it is contended that the flat rate of contribution can be justified only if thesystem permits the segregation of the lighter risks, so.that in so far as the  contri-bution exceeds what is required to provide the normal benefits in  these cases,  it shallbe available to give  the members the extra benefits which the contribution justifiesin their case.    It is also urged against pooling that the members of a Society considered as awhole receive, under the present system, the full benefits which the contributions willprovide.  In the case of the members of a fortunate Society the  sickness claims arelight,  and, consequently, there is a substantial  balance  available  for additional benefits; in the less fortunate Society, the heavy sickness claims which have to be metleave  little available for  additional benefits; in both cases,  it is argued that themembers get the same measure of benefit in the long run.    8.   The reasons which  led the Royal Commission to recommend the  partialpooling of surpluses in order to mitigate the inequalities of benefit are given in theforegoing extracts  from the Report.  Since the  Report there have been repeatedrepresentations from Societies which are not in a position to give treatment benefits,that their heavy sickness expenditure would be reduced if the treatment benefits wereavailable to their members.   It is pleaded that where  the need for the treatmentbenefits is the  greatest there is  no money available.   On the  other hand, manySocieties  with a favourable  experience find their moneys  available  for additional benefits increasing at each valuation.   Although  they allocate sums for nearly  all forms  of  treatment benefit the money is more than sufficient to  meet the demands,and unexpended balances  accumulate.   Rural  Societies  set  aside moneys  forophthalmic benefit because the money is there, not because the rural worker especiallyneeds glasses.    9.  Although the system gives free choice of  Society to an insured person, it isprobable  that this  choice  is rarely  made by deliberate selection according to the favourable valuation position of a Society.   As a rule it  is dependent largely  onchance  and individual  circumstances.  In certain occupations the insured personsbecome in many  cases members of the Society connected with that occupation; theparticular Society concerned may have an experience above or below the average, butthis consideration does not appear to enter into the minds of those whose associationsnaturally draw them to the Society.   The inequalities of benefit should theoreticallycause a constant flow of the good  lives or of the persons subject  to the lighter risks to the Societies with the best results, but, in practice, no such movement is discernible.To some extent this may be due to the provision  that additional benefits of a  Societyare not available to an insured person until he has been a member for about 3 years.A member entitled  to small additional benefits may not be prepared to forgo thosebenefits for 3 years, so that he may get larger benefits after  that period has expired.Undoubtedly the average insured person does not understand the system under which two persons paying  the same contributions can receive different benefits.   The manentitled only to 15s.  a  week cannot see why his neighbour  paying the same  contri-bution should get 20s. a week, or why he has to pay for dental treatment  when hisneighbour can get it free through his Approved Society.    10.   The principle of pooling is not entirely novel to the scheme of national healthinsurance.  Under the Act of 1918, the Central Fund was established for the purposeof meeting the residual part of any deficiencies at valuation remaining over in cases
where the deficiency is due to an abnormal rate of sickness or is due to any other special cause beyond the control of the Society.  The fund was formed partly by setting aside a fraction of each weekly contribution producing about  150,000 a year,together with a special annual contribution from the Exchequer of an approximately equal amount.  Since January 1921  the contributions  to the fund have  been suspended.  By that date  the fund had grown  sufficiently large to meet any claimslikely to arise against it over a considerable period and it has not up to the presentbeen necessary to reimpose the charge on the wreekly contributions.    11.   Although great disparities in valuation results are the logical outcome ofthe present system of national health insurance, the growing divergencies of benefitsas between societies and as between branches in the same Society constitute in theirapparent unfairness the greatest  menace to  the  Approved Society system.  It isdifficult to justify to the uninstructed a national scheme under which some  societiescan give  their members, and those belonging to a class  who are most subject to sickness,  only the minimum  statutory benefits while others after  making liberalincreases in the normal cash  benefits have more than sufficient available to provideall the forms of treatment additional benefits                                  ADDENDUM.                        Note by the Government A ctuary.    1.  The  recommendation of the Royal Commission  on this  subject was thatpooling should be applied to 50 per cent, of the surplus earned in each five years, thesurplus earned being defined as the total surplus at the end of the period less the sum(accumulated at interest over the five years) of the surplus carried forward fromthe previous valuation and the Contingencies Fund at the date of that valuation.    2.  It was  estimated  for the Royal  Commission that under the conditions prevailing when they  deliberated  there  might  be available  for pooling  about 1 million a year.    So far as the Third Valuation  has proceeded this estimateappears to be justified  in regard to  the  period between  the  Second and ThirdValuations.   It  is unlikely, however, to be realised in  the future.   There are threereasons for this :     (a) The level of sickness and disablement benefits is now much above the average          of the five years 1924-1928.    (b) The reduction in the State grant did not become operative until 1st January,          1926, and its full  effects will not be exhibited in the result of the Third          valuation.    (c) Insurance Funds (with the normal State grant) were not charged with the          full cost of medical benefit until 1927, and here also the Third valuation          will not show the full effect of the change.  It is very difficult to estimate          the future growth of surplus under the conditions now prevailing.   Some          societies will continue to acquire substantial amounts of new  surplus, but          in very many cases surplus has ceased to grow and such additional benefits          as are being paid  will gradually  eat up  the  surplus reserved from the          years of prosperity.  It is doubtful whether  500,000 a year can be relied          upon as the result of pooling 50 per cent, of the  surplus acquired in the          future.    3.  It is presumed that the funds obtained from the pooling of surpluses  couldbe applied to finance some  new  benefit.  Alternatively, they  might  be used  to subsidise societies below the line.  There would,  however,  be fierce opposition tosuch a transference of funds,  and indeed the Royal Commission reported that if themoney were used to subsidise  the weaker societies it might have the effect of raisingsome of them to  a better position than that of some of the societies contributing tothe pool.    4.  In finding a new benefit to be maintained out of the pooled  money, it isnecessary to look for some purpose that would not cost more than the money estimated to be  available,  with the normal  State  grant which  it  would attract.  It must,however, be recognised that once a new benefit is adopted and put into operation the
money will  have to be found to defray its cost, whatever that  proves  to be, andalthough a benefit might be found of which the cost could be accurately measured inadvance, there would still remain such uncertainty as resulted from  the basic factthat the income out of which  the charge  was to be met was  dependent on theproduction of more or less fortuitous surpluses.    The Exchequer would, in fact, have to guarantee payment of the bill and hope for the best JO far as the surpluses were concerned.    5.  The. Third  Valuation has now  proceeded a considerable way, and in the caseof  a  large  number  of societies  and  branches  the  schemes  of  additional benefits  resulting   from  it  have  just been put  into operation.    In  thesecases   it   is  too   late  for  pooling  so  far  as  the  Third   Valuation   isconcerned, and as .all  societies must be treated alike, no pooling is possible except on the results of the Fourth Valuation.  These  results  will  begin to be availabletowards the end of 1934, but will not all be ready until the end of 1936.  If, therefore,to meet the point raised in the last paragraph it were decided that plans for the newadditional benefit should not be made  until it was seen how much money would beavailable for the first five years, it would appear that the benefit could not come intooperation until  the beginning of 1938.  In  this event the  Exchequer would be protected until, say, the end of 1942, but after that year would have to take the riskof the cost exceeding the amount obtained from pooling.    6.  If the Government were  prepared to throw the risk on the Exchequer fromthe beginning, the  new benefit could begin  at an earlier date but  not earlier thanJuly 1934, since before this date no money at all would  be available.o
