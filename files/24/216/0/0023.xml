THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITArTIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOYEItixTiEr&quot;T.CP.372(30)SECRET.cabinet copy NO -HOURS OF INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT BILL.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.     The Cabinet had before them on the 29th October,1930,the recommendation of the Committee on Home Affairs in favourof the immediate introduction of the Hours of industrial employment Bill, but deferred a decision to another occasion.(Cabinet 65(30),Conclusion  3.)      It would in my opinion create suspicion quite unnecessarilyas to the Governmenfs intention if this Bill is held back andis not introduced at the first opportunity after the completionof the Debate on the Address.   A further reason for immediate action has nov, arisen owing to the impending visit of theGerman Minister of Labour to this country in order to discuss,amongst other things, points arising under the Washington hours convention.   He is expected to arrive about the 12th november and it is obviously essential that the Hours Bill should beintroduced before he comes.       I therefore ask for authority to  introduce the Bill assoon as the Debate on the Address is completed.(Intd.)M.G. B.3rd November, 1930^.
