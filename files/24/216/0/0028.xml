                     IMPERIAL              ECONOMIC   POLICY.                   SUGG SET-SD  SI AT WENT .I. Tho Imperial Conference is satisfied  that  intImperial   trade preferences have been a recognition  of -unity   end, an assistance to producers  in various  parts  of   the Empire.  Believing that the development of inter-   Imperial markets is of the utmost importance to  the   Commonwealth, the Conference takes note:-   (a) That in this development  eaoh or  the Commonwealth       nations has  declared that  it must primarily       consider its own economic  interests, though  all       are convinced that this does not  preclude       helpfulness  in providing markets.   (h) That the Delegates of the United  Kingdom have       declared that the interests of the United                                        3       Kingdom preclude any International economic       policy, like tariffs,  which would injure its       foreign trade or would impose duties upon  food       or raw material;   the  Dominion governments have       declared that the interests of the Dominions       necessitate  a tariff policy intended to encourage       the growth of manufacturing industry.   (c) That the United Kingdom Delegates  have declared       that their fiscal policy does  not  preclude       marketing propaganda and organisation which       will secure  valuable opportunities for the       consumption  of Dominion products  in the United       Kingdom;  the Delegates from the  Dominions,  on       the other hand, have declared  that outside the       protection which they  practise in their own       interests there are great opportunities for the                           -1-
         \i3 e of United Kingdom ruanuf act urea  in their         countrieo , II. Thia problem of mutual accommodation has to be     considered in definite detail,  and the  study which     has been given to it by Minister? of Trade and     Commerce and Committees of Experts haa  shown that     in the time available definite decisions cannot be     reached.  The Conference therefore suggests that the     Governments concerned should undertake  to make     forthwith a close examination of the various methods     by which each may make the greatest possible contri-     bution to economic co-operation within  the Empire  with     a view to presenting reports to a Conference which     will be held in Ottawa next year so soon aa the     reports are ready.III. In the meantime the Conference agrees to recommend -     (a) That the existing preferential margins should         not be reduoed for a period of three years or         pending the outcome of the proposed Conference,         subject to  the rights of the Parliaments to fix         their own budgets from year to year;  and     (b) That the Government? of the several parts cf the         Empire should examine in detail their existing         tariffs, in conjunction with the interests         concerned,  rith a view to considering what         modifications can be made tending to increase         the amount of inte^-Imperial trade. TV, The Conference is of opinion that the Empire Marketing     Board should be reconstituted as a body with a fixed     minim-urn annual income, with a provision enabling it to     receive such other contributions from public or     private sources as it may be willing to accept, for
    the purpose    furthering  the marketing     Empire    products ,Y.  The Conference agrees to reconstitute the  Imperial    Economic Committee on the linos  recommended by the    Committee o^ the C-sn^e^once on Economic  Co-operation.ember IS,  1936.- i i i-
