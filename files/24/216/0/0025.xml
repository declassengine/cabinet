MEMORANDUM BY THE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT             INSURANCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE.1.   The Unemployment Insurance Scheme should he placed on anaotuarially sound and self-supporting basis. .   This involves the establishment of a further scheme on national lines to provide for the unemployed who may not beentitled to benefit under the unemployment insurance scheme.3.   The restoration of the unemployment  insurance scheme andthe formulation of a further scheme raise difficult and far-reaching questions which, in our opinion, cannot be satisfactorily settled ex&amp;ept by means of a strong RoyalCommission, which could consult the various interests involved.4.   Allegations of abuse have been made  and it has been urgedthat we should make immediate amendments  in the law without waiting for a Royal Commission.  &quot;We have  considered this pointvery carefully and have come to the conclusion  that any suohpartial measures, taken in advance of inquiry,  would be un-justifiable.  In practice it would be impossible to single  outspecial cases and deal with them apart from the general problem.It  would equally be impossible and indeed improper, to attemptto  deal with the whole problem without the fullest investigation and consultation with workers and employers, an investigationwhich  could only be satisfactorily conducted by a RoyalCommission.5.   We accordingly propose that a Royal  Commission should  beappointed  immediately to  review the provisions  and working  ofthe unemployment  insurance scheme and to  make recommendations with regard to:-1.
     (l)  its future scope,  the provisions which it should contain and the means by which it may be made solvent and self-supporting and     (2)  the arrangements which should be made outsidethe scheme, for assisting the unemployed.     The Commission should be instructed to proceed asrspidlj as possible with its work and asked to make interimreports on the more urgent matters.                              (intd.)

LAL3J01     ADVISORY  obk jTTEE  on  UNEMPLOYMENTB    &quot; &quot;   &quot;                    INSURANCE oI            MEMORANDUM BY THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY REPRESENTATIVES            ON TIE THREE  ARTY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMITTEE.     From the documents placed &quot;before us the following factswould appear to ho established:-                UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROPER.(1)  The number on the Live Register is (according to the     latest returns x) 1,498,155 wholly unemployed, 585,156     temporarily stopped, and 105,361 normally in casual     employment9 making a total of 2,188,672, of v/hom     approximately 95c  of the men and 88^0 of the women are     actually in receipt of benefit.(2)  The income of the Fund from all sources is approximately      45,0003000.(3)  The outgoings from the Fund amount approximately to      70,0009000.(4)  The debt on the Fund is now an reaching  60,000,000.     Thus there is a gap between the income and the outgoingsof the Fund amounting to 25 90009000 ;oer annum, and this gapib being closed by borrowing..   In our view there is alreadygrave doubt whether the existing debt can ever be fullyredeemed, and to go on adding to it seems to us to be merelyobscuring the actual position of the relations between theExchequer and the Fund.                   TRANSITIONAL  BENEFIT.(1)  The entire cost of transitional benefit falls on the     Exchequer3 and will amount to about  21,000,000 in the     current year.   This payment has, in our view, ceased to     be insurance;   it is in fact a maintenance allowance     outside the Public Assistance Scheme paid without the     tests attaching cither to a contributory insurance     scheme or to the Poor Law.(2)   The rate of benefit paid is the same as that received     by the persons who have satisfied all the statutory     tests, including the full contributions test of 30     contributions within the last two years.(3)   Those on Transitional Benefit number more than 340,000 -     an increase of 200,000 since February last.   In     consequence of the Act of February, 1930 about 110,000     persons who previously had not been in receipt of     cither Poor Law relief or unemployment insurance were     brought into &quot;benefit&apos;1.22nd October, 1930.1.
      The position in regard to this &apos;*transitional&quot; group is of special urgency,  since by Statute the period during which this benefit expires begins in April,  195.1.                HEPESSARY  MEASURES,   FART_I -  INSURANCE.      It is  egreed that it is necessary to place the Insurance Fund on an  insurance basis.   It is important also  that  the general public  should  distinguish between real  insurance  and other forms of  relief.   Outside the unemployment scheme,, individual  examination is necessary to determine what are individual  needs  as  regards  maintenance and remedial treatment.A flat  rate of  payment is quite unsuitable,  and individual examination should include a test of  means.   We would add that the  position of the  beneficiaries of  the insurance scheme proper,whether actual  or  potential,  is prejudiced by the  presentsituation.      There  are  three ways in which the  scheme can  be made  eelf-sup-oortingo   The contributions  may be  increased, the benefitsreduced,  or the numbers  on the  Fund may be brought  down bystiffening  up the  qualifications  for benefito      If benefits are not  to be  reduced  or  contributionsincreased,  the burden  of  those  sensibly in  excess  of thebalancing point must be  carried by other means, unless an  earlyrevival in  trade should absorb  the surplus.   In our opinion itis not  legitimate  to anticipate so large a reabsorption at anearly date.     The Minister has  stated  that on the existing scale ofcontributions and benefits, the Unemployment Insurance fund would remain  self-supporting  so long as  the number  of-unemployed persons in receipt of benefit does not exceed,240,000,
A. CJ&apos;      The  reduction- in numbers-*r^qulj?ed^jLs  about -40TO of  the -oreserrt&apos; &quot;* register.   This,  it  is  clear,  can only be  achieved  by requiring  a higher  qualification than hitherto for Insurance Benefit, and  can he obtained either by raising  the stamp  qualification or  adopting a ratio of benefit  to contribution, with a limit to the number of weeks in  any year.   One or  other of  these methods  must be adopted, and from  the information supplied to  us  we think that the latter alone would be likely to prove effective.   It  is also clear that relief could be afforded to  the Fund by  measures to  correct practices which,  even though within the  statutory framework of the scheme,  are admitted by  all to be  abuses of the  original intentions of Parliament,     We were impressed by the evidence submitted to  the Committee regarding the manner in which the resources of the Fund are being depleted on  a large and increasing scale by organised arrangements between employers and employees, by which  short-time  is systematically worked and wages supplemented from the Fund.     We consider that power  should be  given forthwith to theMinister to  schedule for examination and necessary action industries in which organised short-time is reaching  dimensions  far beyond those contemplated when the Insurance schemes were initiated.                        NECESSARY  MEASURES. PART II:- RELIEF.     It is clear that tho numbers of those outside the insurancescheme proper will be increased if the Insurance Fund is to bebrought to a state of solvency.     As stated above, the annual amount paid on Transitional Benefitamounts to  81,003,000,  and this without the obligations laid on either Poor Law or Insurance claimants.     It is impossible that these large sums should continue to be paid out on  this basisj   for these cases,  as already  stated, a flat rate is unsuitable and individual examination indispensable.     Accordingly we consider that those among the unemployed who would no longer be qualified to draw insurance benefit should be relieved under separate arrangements having no connection whateverwith the Unemployment Insurance.Scheme.     We recognise that as the Responsibility for this category is largely national the larger proportion of the expense
                                                        1-5-6under these provisions mu3t probably he horne  by theExchequer.   Actual administration should be worked throughthe Local Authorities to prevent overlapping.    weconsider, however, that both for administrative and for financial reasons a further step is necessary.   regional commissioners should be appointed for each large area,  towhom the arrangements for the handling of these funds shouldbe entrusted.   The fact that the areas in question would.be large, and few in number, would enable the commissioners to take  a wide view and to envisage a national policy,constructive rather than merely relieving.   Methods ofco-operation between the Departments concerned, which involve  problems of administration rather than matters ofprinciple, should, be worked out by an inter-departmentalcommittee.       The House is to be asked to authorise an increase cfthe debt of  the already heavily indebted Insurance Fund beforethe year is  out.  In addition, before the end of  thefinancial year, the Treasury will have to lay a largesupplementary estimate for  transitional benefit.  Further,the Minister will require to introduce and pass a Eilldealing  with the  transitional beneficiaries, whose position,it was specifically stated, would bo reviewed before theconclusion of the period for which powers were taken, aperiod which begins to expire in April next.      In the present  financial circumstances  of the nation,we  should feel  compelled to oppose measures to provide further  supply  for these purposes, unless active  steps areconcurrently taken to  restore the solvency of  the Fundupon  a contributory basis and to correct those defects inthe  existing system which have contributed to its presentposition.

THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GCVERHMENT.      AIYISCRY OCMklTTLE %N UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Dear Miss Bondfield,     It was agreed when we separated on Thursday last that therepresentatives of the three parties should submit theirseveral memoranda expressing their opinion upon the facts and conclusions already considered.   We prepared a memorandumaccordingly, and, in fact, had the draft typed that afternoon.Our intention was that we should meet early this week toamplify or amend the draft if we thought it advisable after afurther perusal of the documents.     On Monday, ho7/ever, at the meeting of the Liberal ShadowCabinet, we were made acquainted with the terms of the King&apos;sSpeech.   In view of the paragraph relating to UnemploymentInsurance, it was apparent that the policy of the Governmenthad already been determined and, therefore, further consultationwas made unnecessary.   In these circumstances we had some doubt whether our memorandum could serve any useful purpose but vrehave thought it advisable in courtesy to yourself and our colleagues on the Committee to send it.     We have purposely refrained from any amendment to ourdraft, which you will observe bears last Thursday&apos;s date.                        Yours sincerely,                           (Sgd.)

                                                            1 k q                                                            -&apos;-1.* 0                     MEMORANJJUja.     Having carefully considered all the relevant documents,and having had the advantage of consultation with our colleagues upon the Committee we desire to express our viewsupon the issues which have emerged.   We concur in theconclusions at which the Committee has already arrived, viz(l)That it is essential that the Insurance Fund shall he placed upon a solvent basis.   (2)  That provision shall be made fromother sources for such able bodied unemployed persons ascannot be carried by the fund when it is placed on such abasis.   (3) That this payment shall be distinguished from thepayment of unemployment benefit, and shall not be on a flat rate but shall have regard to individual need.     In our view the machinery for the administration relatingto the uninsured able bodied unemployed should be nationalin character and the provision for this class should be whollyor mainly a national charge.     We think the objections to imposing this task upon thenew Public Assistance Committees are valid, and that an ad hocorganisation is essential.     Seeing that so large a measure of agreement has been arrived at we apprehend that difference of opinion willprobably arise as to the time and method of bringing theseagreed changes into effect.     Obviously the whole question must come up for theconsideration and action of parliament at an early date.   ABill must shortly be introduced to extend the present borrowing
 powers,  and again,  within a few months,  legislative provision must he  made to deal with those persons  now under transitional. arrangements.   We think it is  impracticable to  ask  Parliament to sanction these immense new  financial  commitments unless  the House of Commons  can be assured that  the essential  changes  are to be carried out with the least possible delay.    Public opinion  has been  strongly expressed upon this matter, and the action of the  Government in setting up our Committee has been a  considerable factor in this  concentration of  public interest upon this grave problem.    The Chancellor of the  Exchequer  in his speech on  October 15th stated clearly that  it was the duty of  &quot;Parliament  to  face up to this problem,  and unless the Committee can  agree  upon immediate  action the country as well as  Parliament  will have  the strongest grounds for complaint and criticism.      If,  therefore,  the  Minister of Labour should introduce a simple Bill  for the  extension  of the borrowing powers post- postponing the effort to  grapple with the problem of  solvencyuntil the uncertain future  we believe she will be inviting disaster.   We  agree  that the problems raised are not easy of solution but we do not think that any further delay would bewarranted.     We have devoted  throe months to the anxious consideration of  the duty committed to us, and we believe there would be serious resentment if we did nothing more than suggest another inquiry involving indefinite delay.     We have considered  the suggestion as to the appointmentof  a Royal Commission and in our opinion this  proposal is opento grave objections.   Inasmuch as agreement has  been reachedupon tho main objectives of Unemployment Insurance policy theline of enquiry burely should be as to the time  and  the  method of  the application of these recognised principles.
\     For that purpose we consider an inter-departmental.Inquiry would he the better machinery for the solutioncf such technical problems, end the informationnecessary could be obtained with greater expedition.Our conclusion, therefore, is that coincident with theintroduction of the money- Bill actual proposals shouldbe submitted to the House of Commons, thus giving both to Parliament and the Country the assurance that the urgent reforms upon which all Parties seem to be agreedshall not be further delayed.(Sgd.)
