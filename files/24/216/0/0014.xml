C A B I H 3 T,                            QUOTA FOR DOMINION 1SH3A.T.-                                      DIFORMATIOH.                Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.             In connection with  the paper which has &quot;been circulated         regarding the proposed quota &quot;for Dominion wheat, I am now         circulating, for  the information of my colleagues, the attached         figures which have a &quot;bearing on  the question.-             -about one-half of our imports of wheat are at present         derived from Australia and Canada, and, of the remainder, we         derive about two-fifths  from the United States and about  the         same from the Argentine.   The probability is that we could         increase our imports from the Dominions &quot;by means of a quota         without seriously affecting our trade relations with  the         Argentine.   The  proposal- is that the quota should &quot;be fixed at         first at a point  appreciably above the existing proportion         and that it should he increased as and when it was found         possible without  running the risk of any serious trade reactions.             It is not proposed  to guarantee any price to the Dominions.         Moreover, an increase of price as a result of the introduction         of the quota scheme is improbable, seeing that to-day we  take         less than one-third of Canada&apos;s and of Australia&apos;s exports of         wheat and that the millers would be left free to purchase the         Dominions wheat where they pleased and as and when they pleased.         But no doubt it would be as well in the Bill to provide for         the removal of the quota if the system were abused.                                                W.G.         Board of Trade,           27th October,  1930.
