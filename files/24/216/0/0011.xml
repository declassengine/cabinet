Note by the Lor&amp;-President of tho__Council.                   The only Bill which is at present ready and approved         by the Cabinet for introduction in the House  of Lords is the         Education (Looai Authorities) Bill, 1930.   In addition to  this,         there have been six other Bills suggested for earDy introduction         in the House of Lords.   Of these six 3ills -              (l)  two, the Merchant Shipping (Safety  Convention) Bill,                   1930, and the Poisons and pharmacy  Bill, 1930, are                   drafted and ready.   I understand that the st? two                   Bills will be considered by the Home Affairs                   Committee on October 27th and will  probably, in  the                   ordinary course, eome before the Cabinet the same week              (2)  two, the Improvement of Livestock (Licensing of Bulls).                   Bill, 1930, and the Kuseums and G-sslleries (Loan  of                   Pictures Abroad) Bill, 1930, are in draft and are                   likely to be ready early in the Session:              (5)  two, tho Ancient Monuments Bill, 1930, and tho                   Children Bill, 1.930, are not yet ready in draft  form.                   The House of Lords, should it be thoiight necessary,         could undertake further work.                                                   (Intd) P.24th October, 1930,
