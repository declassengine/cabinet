NATIONALITY  OF MARRIED  WOMEN  BILL.             i -                Memorandum by the Home  Secretary.         The Second Reading  of thi3  Bill  is the  first  order  for    Friday,  November 28th, and I should like  to  have the advice of    my colleagues as to the  attitude which the Government Spokesman    should adopt during the  Second Reading Debate.  The  Bill is pre-    sented by Dr. Bentham and is supported, among others, by all the    women Members of Parliament.  It is in identical terms with the    Bill introduced last Session by  Captain Cazalet, and my  colleagues    will remember that no less than  239 Members  on all sides of the    House have signed a petition in  favour of the Bill.         The Bill has three  main objects.  It provides -         (l)  that a&apos;woman who  is a  British subject shall not lose,         or be deemed to lose, her British nationality by reason of         her marriage with an alien;         (2)  that an alien woman who,  after  the coming into force         of the Act, shall marry a British subject shall not, by         reason of 3uoh marriage, be deemed to be a British subject;         and         (3)  that a woman,  notwithstanding marriage, shall  be com-         petent to apply for and receive naturalization under the         same conditions as  a man,  and that a woman shall not be under         any disability by reason of marriage.         The Bill has a retrospective effect, since it provides that    a woman, who has in the  past lost her British nationality by    marriage to an alien, shall  be deemed to  be a British subject,    unless she makes a declaration of alienage within a specified    period, and it safeguards the position of alien women who have    already been recognised as British on their marriage with British    subjects.
      It will be seen that the- Hi lJOaas. be^n^jbrufted. Ux glare full effect to the demands made by the Women&apos;o Organisations for fullequality of the sexes in the sphere of nationality law.  that principle has already been fully endorsed by the present government, and our representative at the Hague Conference on theCodification of International La?/, held at the Hague this year,was expressly authorised to announce publicly that His Majesty^Government in the United Kingdom was in favour of this principle.It was, however, recognised by the Government at the time that nochange in British law could be made except with the unanimous agreement of the Members of the British Commonwealth, and this qualification of our acceptance of the principle of equalitybetween the sexes was implicit in the declarations made by theUnited Kingdom delegate on the subject.      It is unnecessary for me to remind my colleagues of thehistory of the question of the nationality of married women, afull report on this question having been recently circulated to members of the Cabinet in a Memorandum E.(Bl (30)25 prepared forthe purposes of the Imperial Conference,  It is enough to say thatever since 1914 it has been the accepted constitutional practicethat no change in the nationality law should or could be made byany Member of the Commonwealth except after previous consultation and unanimous agreement.      As my colleagues are aware, the question of nationality,including that of the nationality of married women, was on theAgenda for the Imperial Conference, which has  just been concluded.The disoussion of the general principles affecting nationalitywithin the Commonwealth gave rise to an  acute controversy  withthe Irish Free State.   Ultimately, however, after prolonged dis-ouosion, certain conclusions on the general question of nationalitywere reached by the Conference.   Among  these conclusions is anemphatic reaffirmation of the existing practice in the form ofa declaration that any changes in the requirements for the commonstatus should be introduced only after consultation and agreement
                                                            CM                                                            fO i. ny                         - 3 -amongst the several Members of the Commonwealth.      The recent Imperial Conference also gave c(msid-era-tioxi &quot;tothe question of the nationality of married women.  The Conference -assumed that, as all the Members of the Commonwealth represented at the Hague Conference had signed the  Nationality Conventionthere concluded, such legislation as was necessary Would be intro-introduced to give effect to Articles 0-10* of that Convention, whichare set out in the footnote.  The Imperial Conference was, however,satisfied that any proposals for the further modification of theprinciple of the existing law would fail to secure unanimous agreement, and they therefore felt themselves unable to make any recommendation for the substantive amendment of the law on thissubject, which went beyond what was agreed at the Hague Conference.I understand that there was in fact no possibility that even amajority of the Dominions would be able to support any proposalswhich go beyond the Hague Articles.      I fear that the Women&apos;s Organisations will be very dis-appointed with the recommendation of the Imperial Conference onthe question of the nationality of married  women.  Some of these organisations have already urged the Government not to ratify theHague Convention because, in their view, it does not go far enough in the direction of conceding the women&apos;s demands.  The Women&apos;organisations, as a whole, have urged that, even if unanimous agreement with the Dominions cannot be obtained, legislation.3hould be introduced into the Parliament at Westminsterj  andthey have endeavoured to  justify this step by saying that uniformityArticle 8*  If the national law of the wife causes her to lose hernationality on marriage with a foreigner, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring the nationality of her husband.Article 9.  If the national law of the wife causes her to lose hernationality upon a change in the nationality of her husbandoccurring during marriage, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring her husband&apos;s new nationality.Article 10. Naturalization of the husband during marriage shall not involve a ohange in the nationality of the wife except with heroonsent.
must give way to justice.   In view of&quot;the delicate and difficult position which has been disclosed at the.Imperial Conference on thegeneral constitutional position in regard to nationality,  itis manifest that . serious  results would follow from adopting thissuggestion of the Women&apos;s  Organisations.  Indeed, however  muchHis Majesty&apos;s Government may sympathise with the proposals inDr. Bentham&apos;s Bill, any steps taken by the Government to facilitate the passage of this Bill into law would be a clear breach of theagreement only reoently reached at the Imperial Conference.  Apartfrom our obligation to keep faith with our Dominion colleagues, any departure from the letter  or the spirit of this agreement mighthave the most disastrous consequences upon the constitutional  &apos;relationship of the Members of the Commonwealth to the Crown.  Anessential element in that  relationship is the common statuspossessed by all British subjects, and the common allegiance owedby them to His Majesty.  If the Bill were passed into law and corresponding provisions were not passed by all the Legislaturesof the Dominions, the effect would be that while theBritish nationality of  certain women would be restored to them so far as concerns the  United Kingdom and the colonies, these samewomen might be in the position of aliens in those Dominions whichhad not any corresponding legislation.  This would be the first step towards destroying the Empire-wide  status of british nationality.   Moreover independent  action by the United kingdom parliament is^unde sir able because, upon  the repeal of the ColonialLaws Validity Act, it will be open to the Dominion Legislaturesto repeal any Imperial  Act which  extends to them  and  to pass suohlegislation as they think fit on  the subject.  The preservation of a uniform code  of law relating  to  the  common status will  depend upon the willingness of every Member of  the Commonwealth to adherefaithfully to the agreement not to  legislate without  the fullconcurrence of all other Members.   It would be fatal  to the solidarity of the Commonwealth in this vital matter if the Houseof Commons were to pass this Bill and thus  openly declare that theywere unwilling to hold  themselves bound  by  the principle
unanimously recommended by the Imperial Conference.  Any suchdeparture by our Parliament would create a situation of specialdanger as regards the Irish Free State who would invoke suchaction by the United Kingdom as a justification for departingin their turn from the recently concluded agreement.  My own view, therefore, is that the Government Spokesman will have no alternative but to explain to the  House that the Bill containsproposals which go far beyond any possible measure of agreementbetween the different Members of the Commonwealth, and that,as it is essential to maintain uniformity, the Government cannotsupport the Second Reading to the Bill.  In answer to anyoritioism that may be made that it is unfair that British women should continue to suffer their existing disabilities by reasonof marriage to an alien, I would suggest that the government spokesman should be authorised to say that the Government areprepared to consider the question of providing/legislation toenable women, who by reason of marriage had lost their british nationality, to enjoy the rights and privileges to which theywould be entitled or would receive, so far as action by thiscountry is concerned, if they had not lost their British nationality.I understand that some such proposal was discussed at the ImperialConference, and it was recognised that such legislation would notin any way prejudice the general issues.                                             J .R . C.20th November,1930.
