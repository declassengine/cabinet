Copy No.-                               CABINET.                      ^           CO-ORDINATION OF  LONDON  PASSENGER TRAFFIC.            Memorandum by tho Minister  of Transport.          In accordance with the  Cabinet decision 47(30)8, I have proceeded with discussions  with  the  interests  concerned along the lines approved and  while the negotiations must necessarily take a little time I  hope  shortly  to be in  a  position to give the draughtsman instructions for the preparation of the Bill.   I am however advised by  Parliamentary Counsel that as the Bill must affect certain private rights the  Authorities of the House will probably decide that  it must proceed as a hybrid Bill.   This would involve  proof of compliance  with Standing Orders, including the publication of  Press and Gazette Notices, the first of which must  have  appeared  not later than  the  4th December.   It appears that  there  is  no certain way of avoiding this procedure, consistently with the  preservation of  the essential features of our proposals.         The Press  and Gazette Notices must describe generally the subject  matter  of the  Bill  and must be drawn in terms sufficiently wide  to  embrace any provisions to be included in the Bill which might be deemed to  involve  interference with the  rights of particular parties.         It will also be necessary to instruct Counsel to appear onbehalf of the Bill when it  reaches Committee  and  I  propose toproceed  at once with the necessary arrangements.         I have given  instructions for the  preparation and issue of the Notices in order to protect the  position.25th November, 1930.(Intld.)  H.M.
