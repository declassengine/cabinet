(1.) PUBLICATION IN GERMANY  OF  PART OF THE REPORT OF                THE  IRON AND STEEL  COMMITTEE.    THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Council that his attention had been drawn recently  to the  publication in Germany by the Kblnische  &apos;Zeitung of aseries of articles which showed clearly that that Journal had had access to the Reportof the Iron and Steel Committee of the Council.   A considerable part of that report had been embodied without acknowledgment in those articles,  and in at least one case an important paragraph of the Committee&apos;s Report had been reproducedverbatim as a quotation.   He took a very serious view of this leakage.   The cabinet had decided not to publish the Report of this Committee, and no intimation of any-kind had appeared in the British Press regarding its contents.  It was, therefore,the more unfortunate that it should have been used in  Germany for the purpose ofGerman propaganda against the British industry.   He appealed to members of theCouncil to take special care to keep under lock and key confidential reports circulatedto them for information.    In reply to a  question by Sir William Hardy, THE PRIME MINISTER saidthat this  leakage differed from  the normal type.  Usually,  where there was aleakage of confidential information, the leakage was only partial, and the informationpublished was to some extent inaccurate.   In the  present case, some unauthorisedperson clearly had had  access to the  Committee&apos;s Report and had  made  extractstherefrom.                                 Conclusion.    THE ECONOMIC ADVISORY COUNCIL took note of the above statement by the PrimeMinister.                    (2.) THE  ECONOMIC  SITUATION.    THE  ECONOMIC ADVISORY  COUNCIL  had  before  them  the  Report  of  theCommittee of Economists (Council Paper E.A.C. (H.) 127).    THE PRIME MINISTER said that the  Committee&apos;s terms  of reference fellinto two parts.  In the first they were instructed &quot; to  review the present economic condition of Great Britain,  and to examine the causes that are responsible  for it.&quot;This part of their reference was  discharged in Sections II and III of the  Report.On this part of their subject they were substantially agreed.   In the second partof their terms of reference the Committee were instructed &quot; to indicate the conditionsof recovery,&quot; and they  dealt with this in the second part of their Report.  Theyhad attempted to  examine from an economic point of view the principal types  ofremedy  which had been suggested.  The Prime Minister said that the most con-venient  method to deal  with the Report would be to consider, it section by section.The opening part consisted, as  he had explained,  of  a diagnosis of the  existing situation.                                 (a) --Rigidities.    MR. BEVIN drew  attention  to the  statement in paragraph 12 (iii) (at the top of page 6) regarding the persistence of restrictive rules and practices among tradeunions since the war.  He inquired on what evidence the Committee based their viewthat this persistence had been very marked.   Personally, he believed  that there hadbeen a constant process  of adaptation throughout that period, and a  general state-ment such as that in the  Report was, in his view, most mischievous.    THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Council  that this question was dealtwith more fully by the Committee in Section V of their Report (Ways of restoringElasticity to the Economic Structure of Great Britain, paragraphs  35 to 40), and suggested that that would be the most convenient point for discussion on this subject.    SIR ALFRED LEWIS said that he desired to offer a similar comment in regardto the statement  in paragraph  12 (i), where the  Committee  had referred to  the&quot; increase of rings and monopolistic combinations designed to  restrict the volume oftrade.&quot;  In particular,  he took exception to the term   anti-social&quot; applied to suchcombinations.  The whole implication  of this paragraph was  highly critical, andsuch definite statements without evidence were, in his opinion, to be deprecated.
(1.) PUBLICATION IN GERMANY  OF  PART OP THE REPORT OF                THE IRON AND STEEL  COMMITTEE.    THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Council that his attention had been drawn recently  to the  publication in Germany by  the  Kolnische  Zeitung of aseries of articles which showed clearly that that Journal had had access to the Reportof the Iron and Steel Committee of the Council.

THE ECONOMIC ADVISORY COUNCIL took note of the above statement by the PrimeMinister.                    (2.) THE  ECONOMIC  SITUATION.    THE ECONOMIC  ADVISORY  COUNCIL had  before  them  the  Report  of  theCommittee of Economists (Council Paper E.A.C. (H.) 127).    THE PRIME MINISTER said that the  Committees terms  of  reference fellinto two parts.  In the first they were instructed :&quot; to review the present economic condition of Great Britain, and to examine the causes that are responsible  for it.&quot;This part of their reference was  discharged in Sections II and III of the  Report.On this part of their subject they were  substantially agreed.

(a);Rigidities.    MR. BEVIN drew attention  to the statement in paragraph 12 (iii) (at the top of page 6)  regarding the persistence of restrictive rules and practices among tradeunions since the war.

SIR ALFRED LEWIS said that he desired to offer a similar comment in regardto the statement in paragraph  12 (i), where the Committee had referred to the&quot; increase of rings and monopolistic combinations designed to restrict the volume oftrade.&quot;  In particular, he took exception to  the term &quot; anti-social&quot; applied to suchcombinations.  The whole implication of this paragraph was highly critical, andsuch definite statements without evidence were, in his opinion, to be deprecated.
?    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that abundant evidencehad been obtained by the  Board  of Trade  Committee  after the  war  regardingmonopolistic restrictions. This was mainly with reference to the building trades.    MR.  KEYNES said that,  both in the case referred to by Mr. Bevin and that by Sir Alfred Lewis, the  fact that  such  abuses existed was  notorious.  To what extent such practices were growing, it was, he agreed, more difficult to determine.The point of the paragraph  in question was to draw attention  to  the  lack ofadaptability of the British industrial system due to the absence of laissez  faire.both on the side of capital and on that of labour.  The Committee had laid no great stress on such rigidities when discussing remedies, but they had thought  it  important to draw attention to them in their diagnosis of the present situation.  The existence-of such rigidities greatly increased the difficulty for this country in meeting largechanges in the value of money.    MR. BEVIN said that he disputed the view that craft division did really affectthe efficiency of industry.  Any general attack on craft division would,  he believed,lead to a shortage of trained men.  An inquiry that he had held in the shipbuilding industry after the war had shown that abuses existed only in a very  limited numberof grades.    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the  introduction of mechanical devices was constantly  throwing skilled  men out of employment.  Theynaturally objected to such displacement, and for this reason raised objection  to theemployment of unskilled men in  operating such machines.    SIR  WILLIAM  HARDY said that,  as  he understood the position, the point which the Committee were trying to make  in this part of their Report was that any form  of  specialisation  tended  to hinder mobility.  The  Committee  were  notcriticising craftsmanship as such.    MR.  KEYNES agreed that this was so.    MR.  COLE  drew attention to the concluding sentence of  paragraph 75 of theCommittee&apos;s Report,  where it was  stated that  some of the members  found the main reason of the present  disequilibrium of  profits and  employment not so much in anunduly high standard of life  as in the fact that the pressure of savings  to find anoutlet abroad was greater than the amount  of foreign investment which correspondedto the balance of trade which this country had at  present.   It was,  in his view,unfortunate  that the  Committee had not  elaborated this view in their  diagnosis.As regards the  diagnosis, there were many individual points with which, taken in isolation, he was in agreement,  but taking the diagnosis as a whole he disagreedwith the balance of  emphasis given to particular  factors. As regards the point raised by Mr. Bevin,  it was clear that restrictive practices existed  both  among theemployers and among the workmen.  It  was,  however, equally clear that the  recenttendency  had been for such restrictions to increase on  the employers&apos;  side and todecrease on&apos;that of the men.    SIR JOSIAH STAMP said that in  this part of their Report the  Committeehad not attempted a balanced consideration of the question of craftsmanship.  Theyhad merely sought to  draw attention to hindrances  caused by such  practices  to the mobility of labour.  From the national point  of view, this was a real disadvantageowing to  the large changes that had taken place in the value of money.    MR.  THOMAS saw no objection to  this portion of the Report, provided that itwas not published.  If that were to be done,  there was a danger that people mightlift particular parts of the Report from their context and use them  in a sense otherthan that intended by the  Committee.    THE PRIME MINISTER  said that there was no intention of publishing theReport, and drew attention to the fact that it was marked most secret and to be kept under lock and key.    THE  PRIME MINISTER,  continuing  the  examination of  the  Report,pointed  out that the Section dealing with the fall of  prices (paragraphs 18 to 21)and the effects of large changes in the value of money (paragraphs 22 to 24) was mainly  a  statement of recent  events.  The Section dealing with the disparity between the prices of primary products and manufactured goods (paragraphs 25 to(b.) Large Changes in the Value of Money.[21981]B 2
27) was to some extent consequential.   The next main Section of the Eeport dealtwith possible remedies of an external character (paragraphs 28 to 34).    MR. KEYNES said that on this Section he desired to emphasise the view of theCommittee that the present  movement  in prices was in part cyclical and in partrepresented a sagging downward tendency. What was novel was the emphasis givenby the Committee to the suggestion that the cyclical element may not prove to be so large  as might have been expected, and that though  some small recovery might beanticipated in  the  near future, there was  a real danger of a continued saggingmovement over a long period.  If there was a risk of this, the situation would indeed be grave, and would, he believed, call for  a change of outlook in regard to possibleremedies.    The apprehension  that prices might follow this course was the maincause  for the sombre character of the Report,    In reply to a question by Mr. Thomas, MR. KEYNES thought that wheat pricesmight go lower than they were at present and remain at such lower levels for a time.    In reply to a question by  Sir William Hardy, MR. KEYNES  agreed that,  ifthere was  a further fall in prices, the effect on this country would  be especiallysevere owing to the rigidities that had been referred to earlier in the discussion andto the weight of the national  debt.    SIR JOSIAH  STAMP added that  another factor which would enhance the adverse effect on this country was our dependence on export trade.    MAJOR ATTLEE referred also to the weight of fixed charges, debentures, etc.,on industry in this country as compared with our Continental rivals.    MR. COLE regarded this  as the vital part of the Report.   It  was imperative that all possible international action should be taken to raise prices, or, at least, to arrest their further fall.  Personally, he felt that there was a very serious possibility &apos;-f a further  sagging tendency in the price level over a long period.    MR. KEYNES thought that, for this  reason, it was all the more important that&apos;..u^c country should not trust entirely to international action.   The prospects  ofsuccess on  such lines was very slender.  In this connection, he drew  attention to theContinental press comments  on the Report of the Gold Committee of the League ofNations.   The general suggestion was that the Report was a  result of  Britishintrigue aiming at hiding the weakness of the gold  position of this country.  Thesuggestion was,  in fact, very similar to that which had been  made  by   foreigncountries when this country suggested naval disarmament.    THE  PRIME  MINISTER confirmed what Mr. Keynes had  said regardingthe attitude of foreign countries to naval  disarmament.    SIR JOSIAH STAMP said  that, since he had signed  the Report,   he had further modified his views on the practicability of taking international action.  Henow7 believed that it would be hopeless to attempt to call an international conference or to  appoint an international committee to consider the question.   Such an attemptwould raise every form of hostility.  The only hope was that, through the Bank ofInternational Settlement and otherwise,  foreign bankers would gradually  adopt amore progressive attitude.    MR. KEYNES thought that this process would take  years.  Personally,  he believed that if there were a good understanding between the central banks of thiscountry  and  the  United  States, the  two countries together  could do much  toimprove the situation.   If, as looked probable, the coming winter  was  bad  inAmerica, he believed that the American bankers would show a greater disposition toco-operate on monetary questions.  The important thing was to overcome the worlddifficulties in the way of long-term international lending.     In reply to a question by Sir Alfred Lewis, MR. KEYNES agreed that at themoment the difficulty was  due to lack of confidence.   A  vicious  circle had been created and possibly this could only be broken by the creation of a pool of guaranteedcredit to revive the confidence  of lenders.     SIR JOSIAH STAMP thought that this country and the United States might do something to alter the French attitude in regard to foreign investment. He agreed that  it was desirable that this country should take the lead.
9 9 9i-j &amp; O    MR.  HENDERSON said that the French would not be encouraged to increase their foreign investments by such failures as that recently announced of the BanqueAdam, which had been due to unwise foreign speculation.    THE PRIME  MINISTER,  summing up this aspect of the discussion, saidthat the general feeling of the Council was that, pending international action, theBritish industrial situation must remain as at present or  become even worse, andthat this should be regarded as a governing consideration.    MR.  COLE and  MR. BEVIN expressed the  view  that  it  might ultimatelybecome necessary to reconsider the  position  of London as a free market for gold.    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, in his view, anysuch  action  wrould  have  disastrous repercussions.   On  the  practicability  ofinternational action, he agreed with the view expressed by Sir Josiah Stamp.  Eventhe publication of  the Report  of the Gold  Committee  had, he  believed,  doneincalculable harm in the United States and in France, where the Report was regardedas a conspiracy by this country.    MR.  KEYNES considered that every  other possible  remedy should  be tried.Moreover, there was no certainty that action such as Mr. Cole suggested would, infact, prove an adequate remedy.    THE PRIME  MINISTER said that,  whatever action was taken, he was convinced that it should not be taken by the British Government as such.  (c)  Ways of Restoring Elasticity to the Economic  Structure of Great Britain.    THE PRIME  MINISTER suggested that the  Council should  now pass to a discussion  of  Section V of the Committee&apos;s Report, which dealt  with ways of restoring  elasticity  to the economic structure of  Great Britain.   A proposal had recently been put forward in the House of Commons that the Government shouldsummon a large conference consisting of representatives of  employers, workmen,bankers and middlemen  to  discuss  this  question.   His  view,  and  that  of hiscolleagues, was  that  nothing effective could  be  looked  for  from a  spectacularconference of this kind.  He believed that  the best course was to follow industrial organisation and to consider each of the principal trades separately.    MR.  BEVIN said that, after his  experience of a similar conference summonedafter the war, he would  be opposed to any such proposal at the present time.   Asregards the question discussed in this part of the  Committee&apos;s Report, he thoughtthat insufficient account had been taken of the progress achieved in recent years.  in large numbers of trades since  1922 there had  been a continual process of  readjust-ment.  In the steel trade and in the sheet trade,  for  example, a complete  changeof practice took place in the years 1922 to 1925.   The return to  the gold standardhad,  to  a large extent,  destroyed  the fruits of that reorganisation,  and hadnecessitated a  reconsideration of the whole question.  There had  then followed thegeneral strike and  the  subsequent natural resistance on the  part of the workingclasses to  wage reductions.   He  cited examples of  reorganisation  of  practicesundertaken by the  trade unions in consultation with the  employers in the SouthWales fuel trade and in the yellow metal and copper  trade in the Indian market.He doubted whether trade unions could do more than they  had done on these lines,except perhaps in a few industries.    MR.  GRAHAM said that he was opposed to the summoning  of a large  general conference.  In the Lancashire cotton trade, for example, the employers were anxiousto arrange for an increase in the number of looms per operative and to get this were willing to increase  substantially  the  earnings of  individual  workers.  The tradeunions realised that such a policy would mean the displacement in Lancashire of a wife or a  son or a daughter formerly employed in the mills.   In effect, therefore, inLancashire, the problem was that of the  family budget,  and  the changes  desiredwould mean a  reduction in the combined  family income.  When trade recovered,this might be made good to some extent, but there would be an inevitable time lag.As regards the Ministry of Reconstruction Committee on Trusts, no action, it was true, had been  taken, but more recently a good deal of attention had been given to thequestion of the restraint of trade.  This was now being examined by a Board of trade committee, whose recommendations would, he hoped, make a contribution towards
meeting; existing rigidities.   It was important to recognise the cumulative effect oflegislation passed in recent years regulating railways, electricity and coal.   It was likely that such public regulation would in time be extended to other  industries.    SIR  DANIEL HALL thought that the fall in prices in the present slump hadnot been fully realised or its effects properly understood owing to the firm hold on prices by  the retail trade.    MR. BEVIN said that much was being done to remove rigidities by arrange-ments for transfer,  by pension schemes and  annuities  and otherwise.  The real difficulty  was that presented by the  man  over fifty, who had passed the  age ofadaptability.  Reorganisation to such a man was, in effect, a sentence of  industrialdeath.   He believed  that  the  situation  could  be improved  if,  on  thoroughre-examination, the social services could be adapted so as to make  a contribution towards  the problem of displacement.   The latest  State pension scheme had increased  the difficulty of getting the older men out of industry.    THE PRIME MINISTER  agreed, but said that  this adaptation could onlybe made after a complete examination of the entire system of social services in thiscountry.    The present  position by  which  a man received  transitional  benefitindefinitely after  his  ordinary unemployment benefit had run out was bad for thewhole country, apart  from the difficulty the Treasury had in finding the necessary funds.    THE CHANCELLOR  OF THE  EXCHEQUER  agreed  that the grant  ofpensions at 65 to men in employment had been a grave mistake.    THE PRIME MINISTER  drew  attention  to paragraph 41,  in  which  theCommittee had referred to the practices which, though legal, were a real abuse ofthe provisions of the unemployment insurance scheme.    MR. KEYNES explained that the Committee had not intended to suggest thatthere were illegal or fraudulent abuses.  They had had in mind rather such matters as, for example, the grant of unemployment benefit to married women.    SIR JOSIAH STAMP  added that under this heading he included arrange-ments between employers  and workpeople to take the maximum  advantage of theprovisions of the law  for the  benefit of their particular industry.    MISS BONDFIELD agreed that short time  arrangements, particularly in theexport trades, entailed a heavy drain on the Fund.  Payment of benefit in  such caseswas, in effect, a subsidy to wages.    MR. COLE suggested that the further consideration of this question might be deferred until the Report of the Committee of which he was Chairman (Committeeon Unemployment Benefit) was available.    THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.  He had just received an advance proof ofthat Report, which he proposed at once to study.                  (d) Reductions in Domestic Money  Wages.    On  the suggestion  of the PRIME MINISTER,  the Council  turned to  theconsideration of Section VII of the Committee&apos;s Report dealing with reductions in domestic money wages.    MR.  BEVIN drew attention to sub-section (vi)  in paragraph  51  of the Report,in which  the  Committee  expressed the view that, if  a general  wage-cut becameinevitable, it was most desirable that  it should be  undertaken as part of  a widerscheme  for resettling money incomes generally  (including  rentier incomes  inparticular), and not wages alone.  Personally, this would have been the first and notthe last of his conclusions on  this subject.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  if there were to be a deliberate attemptto reduce  wages,  it was essential that it should form part of a general  scheme inwhich every class besides wage-earners were called upon to make an  equal sacrifice.    In reply to the Prime Minister, MR. KEYNES said that the question whether any general scheme was possible was dealt with in Section XII of the Committee&apos;sReport.   Oh this  subject, he and Sir Josiah Stamp had favoured a scheme for a
 tariff-bounty.  Speaking for himself, he thought there was also a theoretical  case for, say, a 10 per cent, cut in wages and salaries accompanied by an extra 2/- income tax on other sources of  income.  He was convinced of the advantages of a general scheme, if a practicable one could  be found, as opposed to particular remedies.      SIR JOSIAH STAMP said that, apart from the overwhelming international objections, devaluation was the easiest general method of dealing with the situation. As regards rentier incomes, history showed that they had continuously declined.  He would, himself,  be opposed to any interference with  existing long-term contracts (twenty to forty years) except as a last resource.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,  to some extent, the fall in the rate  of interest and the process of conversion worked in the direction indicated by Mr. Keynes.     MR.  KEYNES agreed,  but added that  there were many  forms of debt which could not be converted except after long  delay.  Moreover, such payments as rents for long leases, pensions, etc., could only be dealt with as part of a general scheme.     THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the sense of the foregoing discussion, said that there was general agreement in the Council that  an attack on wages alone would be  both unfair and  impracticable.  There were,  however,  other  ways of decreasing the purchasing power of money.   Reference had already  been made to devaluation.   There  were also such  measures as a revenue tariff or a system of tariffs and bounties.                               (e)  Revenue  Tariff.     THE  CHANCELLOR  OF THE EXCHEQUER  said that, leaving aside the protective element, the effect  of a tariff would  be to reduce the real value of wages and to provide revenue by a hidden method as compared with the obvious method of direct taxation.  A tariff  was a very unscientific  method of reducing real wages, because being evenly spread, the sacrifice which it would entail would be unfair as  between one class  and another.  It would fall most heavily where  it could least easily be borne, i.e., in the export industries Avhere wages were already very low.     MR. KEYNES said that his scheme  for a tariff plus bounties would, to some extent,  be a  tax upon the  sheltered  industries for the benefit of the unsheltered industries.  As regards a revenue tariff, any rise in  prices would be open to the same objections as those indicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     Referring to the so-called sheltered industries,  MR. BEVIN said  that many of these had been largely reorganised and the wages of large blocks  of them were on a cost of living sliding scale.     In  reply to  a question by Mr. Blair, MISS BONDFIELD  undertook  to furnish a summary of the information published monthly in the Ministry of Labour Gazette regarding the proportion of the wages in the sheltered industries that were on  sliding scales.                   (f) Ways of Increasing Business Confidence.    Referring  to   paragraphs   55   to   57  of   the   Committee&apos;s  Report, SIR  ALFRED  LEWIS  said that he  was  convinced  by  his experience that development  in various directions  was being held  up  through lack  of confidence. Business men were unwilling to enter into more commitments as they saw no prospect of using new  plant, if installed, at a profit.  The question of business confidence was, in his opinion, of  the utmost importance.    In   reply   to   a  question   by   the   Chancellor   of   the   Exchequer, SIR ALFRED LEWIS said that the effect of an additional income tax on confidence would be deplorable.  He cited the case of Switzerland at the time when there  was a threat of a capital levy.    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE  EXCHEQUER  expressed the view  that owing to its effect on business confidence, the addition of 6d. to the income tax nextyear might mean an increase of 500,000 in the unemployed.    In  reply to  a  question by  Mr.  Keynes, the  CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER said  that a  tariff  might  temporarily stimulate  industry to some
extent (a) by relieving employers of their fear of increased direct taxation and (h)by their seeing some advantage from the tariff for their particular trade.   The more that protection was extended, the less would be the advantage given.    SIR WILLIAM McLINTOCK said that, as regards the steel trade, the  initialand a real difficulty was that of obtaining capital for re-equipment.    MR.  THOMAS  said that the contention of the steel industry was that, even ifthey were completely to reorganise themselves, the economies they could secure  in thisway would be insufficient to enable them to continue unless they had a tariff.
