Canals  (Continuance,, of Charging Powers) Acts, 1922                               * and 1924.                Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.                Before the War the charging powers of Tramway, Harbour,       Dock and Pier and Canal Undertakings were regulated by statutory       maximum charges set out in the various Acts governing the       undertakings.                The increased cost of labour and materials due to       circumstances arising out of the War made these maximum charges       inadequate  in many cases and Parliament empowered the Board of       Trade (now  the Minister of Transport) and later the Minister of       Transport to issue Orders as a temporary measure modifying the       permanent maximum charging powers.                Before making an Order under the temporary powers the       Minister is required to refer the application to  an Advisory       Committee for their consideration and report.                There are in existence at the present time 24 Orders       relating to Tramway Undertakings and these will expire on the       31st December, 1931, and 15 Orders relating to Harbour, Dock and       Pier Undertakings which expire at the end of the  present year  and       in regard to which applications have been received for a renewal       for a further period of 12 months.                The Advisory Committees to which the Minister is required       to refer applications have urged the desirability of permanent       legislation, whilst the Association representing  the Tramway       industry has for some years pressed for legislation which would       remove the inconvenience,  expense and uncertainty  incidental to       the present system of the  renewal of the Orders.
         The position of the Canal Undertakings is rather different from that of the Tramway and Harbour Undertakings,  sincethe Canal Undertakings, whose charging powers were increased  byDirectors under the provisions of the Ministry of Transport ..ct,1919, which have been continued under the Canals (Continuance ofCharging Powers) Act, 1922, are not required to make applicationfor the renewal of their powers.   The charging powers of these undertakings are, however, subject to revision by the Minister.         All these temporary Acts have been continued from timeto time by the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts.         &quot;When the continuance of these temporary Acts wasconsidered in 1928 by the Select Committee on Expiring Laws itwas stated that the Minister of Transport contemplated introducingas soon as Parliamentary time would allow, permanent legislation and pending such legislation the Minister recommended that thetemporary Acts should be continued in force for a further periodof five years.         The Committee, however, recommended that the temporaryActs should be continued for a further period of three years  only,and, under the provisions of the Expiring Laws Continuance Act,1928, the temporary Acts continue in force until the 31st December1931.   Unless therefore, special legislation is promoted orprovision is made in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act for next .year for continuing the temporary Acts for a further period,  theUndertakers will either have to promote private bills in theforthcoming session or revert to their p;e-war statutory maximumpowers of charging.         So far as the Harbour, Dock and Pier Undertakings areconcerned 10 out of 15 Orders at present in force relate to smallScottish Undertakings and it is very doubtful whether thefinancial position of these Undertakings would enable them to
promoto the necessary Bills.   The same position obtains in thecase of a number of the smaller Canal Undertakings.         In the circumstances, therefore, it would appearnecessary either that the Government should promote legislation which might take the form of continuing in force the existing powers of charge, subject to the right of the Minister to revisefrom time to time, or that the temporary Acts should be continued in force for a further period by inclusion in the Expiring LawsAct.         The objection to the latter course from the point ofview of the Undertakers, is the uncertainty regarding thecontinuance of the temporary Acts and the expense of having toapply annually for an Order authorising an increase in theircharging powers.   Moreover, this course would merely postpone the need for some permanent legislation and it is uncertain whatview the Expiring Laws Committee may take regarding a further extension of these Acts.         The more satisfactory course might be to introduce in thecoming Session a short Bill to give permanent effect to the orders and Directions issued by the Minister under the temporary Acts andthe Ministry of Transport Act and now in force, subject to any modifications which appear desirable and subject to the right ofrevision by the Minister of the charges so authorised on application being received from local authorities or representative bodies of traders, etc.  amd after consideration by an -AdvisoryCommittee.         The difficulty of adopting this course lies in the doubt as to whether Parliamentary time will be available for such legislation.   Except as regards the Orders now in force inrelation to Railway-Owned Docks (i.e.  those of the Great V/esternRailway and the Scottish Docks of the London,  Midland and scottish and London and North Eastern Railways)  there is no reason to think
 that a measure of this nature would &quot;be  controversial, but it would not be possible, even if these were excluded, to guarantee that it would be unopposed.         In view of the pressure  upon Parliamentary time, however, and the necessity, in fairness to the Undertakings concerned, of announcing the Government1s intentions  at the earliest possible date, I am of the opinion that the most practicable course in the circumstances is that a further extension of the temporary Acts for a period of at least one year  should be obtained through the Expiring Laws Act of 1921 and that  the various bodies concerned should in the meantime  be consulted with a view to the introduction of permanent legislation in the 1931/32 Session,         The Canal Association and certain of the other bodies concerned are pressing for an indication of the Government&apos;s intentions in this matter,  and I  seek the authority of theCabinet to inform the Undertakers at once that the Government will ask Parliament to continue  the temporary Acts in the Expiring LawsAct, 1931, for a further period of at least one year, and to discuss with them the introduction of permanent legislation in the1931/32 Session of Parliaments29th October, .1930.(Lo   H.H.
