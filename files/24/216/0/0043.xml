                    PART  I.Introduction; and Summary of Ministerial                  Comments. (Prepared under the direction of the Lord Privy Seal.)                SECTION 1. INTRODUCTION.    1. The Liberal Report opens with an &quot; Analysis of the Present Unemployment Situation &quot; which may be accepted in its broad outline as a reasonable statement of the position.  There is room, of course, for differences of opinion as to the emphasis that should be laid on different  factors, and  writers who  approached the subject  with a  different  political  or  economic outlook would doubtless distribute the emphasis differently.  But in the main, this section of the Report is written in  an objective spirit.  Each of the various factors upon which stress is laid has undoubtedly contributed in some degree to  our present difficulties;  and no factor of obvious  importance  has been  omitted.   The  only comments which are called for upon this section relate therefore to matters of comparative detail.   2. A point which  is perhaps rather more than one of detail occurs at the outset  of the analysis.   In  dividing the present unemployment figures into three categories, described respectively as (1) normal unemployment;  (2) cyclical unemployment, and (3) special unemployment  (representing what has become known as the &quot; hard core &quot; of the problem), the Report almost certainly underestimates the magnitude of the first category, and, partly as a result of this, seriously overestimates the magnitude of the third.  The &quot; normal  unemployment &quot; is computed  at  &quot; more than  a  quarter of a  million of those on the register.&quot;  It is most  unlikely, however, under the conditions which exist to-day as regards unemployment insurance  and the  registration of persons  as unemployed, that  the  total  Live  Register  figure would fall nearly as low as a quarter  of a million even if  our special industrial difficulties were  overcome  and active trade conditions were restored.  It has been  estimated (U.P.(30)  11) that the minimum Live Register figure  under existing  conditions as regards unemployment benefit, would not, even in years ofgood trade, average less than 690,000 for any year.   3. Having computed the &quot; normal  unemployment&quot; at more than  a  quarter  of  a  million,  and having put  on one side as &quot; cyclical  unemployment &quot; the  increase that has taken place in the past twelve months, the Liberal Report takes &quot; from three- quarters of a  million up to a million &quot; as the measure of &quot; special unemployment&apos;&apos; that remains.  Indeed,  a little later in the Report, the estimate hardens into  the selection of the higher figure, and we are told that &quot; the really grave problem so far as Great Britain is  concerned is the long-continued dead weight of unemployment approaching a million falling under the third heading.&quot;  In view of the fact that in recent years the total Live  Register figure, including  the &quot; normal&quot; element, has on  two occasions  fallen slightly below a million, it is evident that this is an overstatement. After every allowance is made for &quot; normal unemployment,&quot;  the core of long-continued unemployment that remains is undoubtedly a real and formidable phenomenon ;  but its order of magnitude is probably better indicated  by a figure of half a million than by one of a million persons.   4. Similarly the picture which  is drawn in the Report of a relative  stagnation, as compared with other countries,  of pro- duction  in Great Britain during recent years is darker  than is
justified by  the  facts.  The Report  refers to  the  indices ofproduction issued by the Economic and Financial Section of theLeague of Nations as showing broadly &quot; that whilst from 1924 to1929 production has increased in the United Kingdom by rather less than  12  per cent., in the United States it  has increased bysome 24 per cent., in France by 27  per cent., in  Germany by over47 per cent.,  and in Canada by nearly 66 per cent.&quot;  There is noreason to  question these figures,  but the selection of 1924 as the base year gives an  unduly unfavourable impression of the relativeprogress of Great Britain, particularly as compared with theUnited States.  For, in 1924, the United States was undergoinga minor depression of  trade and consequent curtailment of pro-duction which Great Britain  escaped, mainly doubtless owing tothe low exchange  value of the pound sterling during that year.If 1925 be taken as the base year instead of  1924, the pictureportrayed by the League of Nations indices is materially different.This can best be shown by reproducing the following table fromthe &quot; Memorandum on  Production and Trade,&quot; recently published by the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations.INDICES  OF  INDUSTRIAL  PRODUCTION IN VARIOUS  COUNTRIES.                         1925 ^ 100.Country.	1926.	1927.	1928.	1929.A merica 				Canada	117	125	138	154United States	104	102	107	113Europe 				France	117	102	118	130Germany	95	120	120	122Poland ......	98	122	138	138Sweden	103	108	104	127Switzerland	95	112	117	111United Kingdom	.  	107	106	112U.S.S.R.......	141	172	208	240   5. Thus, if 1925 be taken as the base, the rate of increase ofproduction in Great Britain up to 1929, though much less thanthat of some other countries, was comparable  with that of  theUnited  States and Switzerland.   Indeed, inasmuch as  no one would contend that  the  industrial progress of the two lattercountries up to 1929 was unsatisfactory, the ranging of different countries according to the figures in the last column of this tableis  chiefly  significant  as suggesting that the  percentage  rate of increase of industrial production is  an  unsafe foundation  forsweeping generalizations.   6. It may be worth noting in this connection that if the com-parison between  production in Great  Britain and  the  UnitedStates is carried into the present year, it yields results  which  are actually favourable to Great Britain.   For, whilst production inthe United States during the second  quarter of 1930 had fallenback to the level of 1925, production in Great Britain during  thesame quarter was still 2 per cent, above the 1925 level.   7. The essential trouble of British post-war  economic  life hasbeen a serious loss of export markets jy some of our principal industries  rather than a general stagnation  of production as awhole.  Though  prior to the present world slump our exporttrade as a whole was growing steadily year by year, it neverregained its pre-war volume.  It is probable, however, that  theLiberal Report over-estimates the extent of the decline since pre-war days.   Ttie figure for 1929 is probably nearer 90 per cent.than 83   per cent,  of  that for 1913.   (See  note in  BalfourReport on effects of changes of quality on the figure as  crudelycalculated.)  It  must be remembered, moreover, that  1913 was an exceptionally good year;  though perhaps the same may besaid, in relation to pre-war standards, of 1929,
   8. It is admitted in the Liberal Report that the serious declinein trade and employment, which has occurred as the result of theworld depression,  &quot; is no evidence of a further serious relativefalling off on our part.&quot; But the suggestion is made that our com-competitors are likely to adjust their costs more quickly and morecompletely than we to the altered conditions, and accordingly to emerge from the depression in a stronger relative position.  Thisis certainly a possibility  which we cannot  afford to disregard.There is as yet, however,  no evidence that  our export trade  isweathering the depression any  worse than  that of  most othercountries ,  and  the following figures  relating to the last  threeavailable months are to some extent reassuring : EXPORTS OF  CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN / STERLING.Country.

In diagnosing the causes of our unsatisfactory position, theReport lays stress on the injury done to the competitive power ofBritish-industry, in the face of a falling world price-level, by theinelasticity of &quot; the factors affecting British costs of production.&quot;It calls attention, in particular, to the heavy burden of the internalnational debt charge which Great Britain has to carry, to the large and growing expenditure on social services, to &quot; less elastic tradeunion wage rates &quot; and to trade union restrictions and demarcationrules.  It asserts that there has been in recent years, as the resultof the increase in the value of money, &quot; a great increase not onlyin real fixed capital charges, but in real taxation, quite indepen-dently of any increased social expenditure &quot; ;  and that &quot; anotherconsequence of deflation has been a further addition to our burdenof real wages.&quot;  This diagnosis leads up to the general conclusionthat &quot; the  principal causes of the continuance of the &apos; refractorymillion &apos; of unemployed are to be found in the fact that we are seeking to  ensure to the nation a standard of life higher than ourpresent  relative national effort and efficiency justify.   10. Now it  is  quite true that Great Britain has to carry  aheavier burden of fixed money charges, such  as interest on thenational debt, than most of her competitors ; and it is further truethat every fall in the  price-level tends to increase the real burdenof these charges, and also to make it more difficult for industry topay wages  at the existing level in terms of money. None the less,so far as the position before the world slump is concerned, the picture  portrayed in  the  Liberal Report,  a picture of  a steadycrippling increase in the real burden of such factors as  the fore-going, is decidedly out of focus. As has been pointed out above,there was a considerable increase between 1924 and  1929 in thetotal national production ;  so that, despite the fall in the price-level, it is  probable that the total  national income, as measuredin money, increased rather than diminished between these years.The interest charge on the national debt did not change appreciablyduring this period, while  the total  amount  of  direct  taxationdecreased.   Thus, though it is true that the real incomes of therentier and the  wage-earner were increasing, there is no  evidencethat, up to the world slump, either the rentier or  the wage-earnerwas tending to encroach on the incomes of other classes of thecommunity.
    11. Even as regards the increase in the real value of what therentier receives,  the Liberal Report  overstates  the case.   Itdeclares  that     &quot; interest on War Loan witn a buying power  of  1 in terms     of the  average cost of living of  1917-20,  is worth some      1 6s. 8d on the average of 1930 prices.  Conversely,  1,000     lent in  the former period is worth to-day in terms of real     values  some  1,333 ;  in other words,  the real burden of     interest has increased from say 5 per cent, to 6f per cent.&quot;This implies that the average cost of living for the period 1917-20is a fair measure of the average value of money at which  thenational debt was  borrowed.  But this is very far from beingtrue.  An important part of the debt  was  raised before 1917,and almost  all of  it had  been  raised  before the latter  part of1919, when  the cost of living began to rise rapidly to a very high level.  The  average cost of living (as measured by the Ministryof Labour index number) at which the debt was  borrowed was perhaps  10  per cent,  higher (not  one-third higher) than that now prevailing.  Moreover,  this index number is  designed  to measure changes in the cost of living of the working class familyand it would not be right to conclude that the  increase in the valueof money to subscribers to war loans has been, over the period inquestion, as much as 10 per cent.    12. As regards wages, the Liberal Report contains the f ohowingpassage :        &quot; Our manufacturers have been compelled again and again    to reduce their selling prices whilst in recent years,  on  the    average, wages have remained practically stationary.  From     1924 to date, Professor Bowley&apos;s Wage Index shows a fall of    only 1 -6 per cent.  During the same period the cost of living    has fallen 10 per cent, with the result that real wages in terms    of purchasing power have increased by over 8 per cent. This    is on top of the increase over pre-war which had already    taken place.&quot;These figures are correct, so far as they go ; but they create  amisleading impression by  failing to  take account of the verymaterial increase in output per head which has taken place duringthe same period.  Actually industrial output  per head was about12 per cent,  higher in the first half of the present year than in 1924.This  increase in output is,  of course, largely attributable  toimproved methods of production, involving the use of additional capital which has to be remunerated out of the increased product.But,  after  allowing a  reasonable  remuneration for capital, itdoes not appear that the increase in real wages from 1924 to 1929outstripped  the growth of productivity by very much, if at aU.    13. Thus, the general contention in the Liberal Report thatthe falling tendency of the price-level has served to increase  thereal burden  which industry has to carry in respect of debt charges,taxation, wages, etc., has much less force in relation to the period from 1924-29 than it has  in relation to the catastrophic fall ofprices which has taken place in the past year.   If the wholesale prices of staple commodities remain at anything like their present level, and if the prices of manufactured goods have to be loweredto restore equilibrium, the total national income, measured interms of money,  must inevitably decline.  In that case  the realburden of debt  interest, the social services and taxation will undoubtedly tend  to  grow,  and  British industry may  find itdifficult to sustain money wages at their present level.  There isno reason, therefore, to dissent  from  the emphasis which is laid in the Report  on the vital importance  to Great  Britain of  thefuture course of world prices.                   SECTION 2. SUMMARY.    14. The  proposals which Mr. Lloyd George makes to meetthe  facts revealed by  his  diagnosis  have been exhaustivelyconsidered by the various Ministers concerned. Their observations,following the sequence  of  the Liberal proposals, form the body
 of this document.  For the convenience of readers the endeavour has been made in the summary below to give a general conspectus of the nature of  Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals and of the content of Ministers&apos;  observations on them.    15. It will be noted that the alternative remedies discussed and rejected  by Mr. Lloyd George namely, Protection, and a general lowering of the standard of life are not dealt with in the memoranda which follow,  and this for obvious reasons.                     Revival of Industry.    16.  In relation to industry, Mr. Lloyd  George finds that the imperative need, which will be readily admitted on all sides, is for a sharp reduction in costs of production &quot; to be brought about by a great increase  in  our national productive and marketing efficiency.&quot;    To this end industry itself, the Banks  and  the State must all contribute.    17. He proposes first, that industry should secure a 10 per cent. reduction in  working costs, and  that, as a preliminary step to concerted action  for this purpose, the Government should summon a National Conference  representative of  all industrial and com- mercial interests. The Minister of Labour and the President of the Board of  Trade are convinced that such  a Conference would be unable to  achieve any  practical results.   It seems inevitable that  interest  would  be centred on propositions  of a general and  political character,   and  agreement  on  these  matters, assuming agreement  to be possible, would contribute  little, if anything, to  a reduction of costs in individual industries.  The Ministers consider that each industry should separately undertake its own internal re-adjustment.  The  necessary  machinery is already in existence and in use and a National Conference would serve to retard rather than accelerate progress.   18. Mr. Lloyd George  suggests  that  distributors as well as producers should be represented  at  the  Conference  since  the benefit of reduced production costs  will be largely discounted in this  country if the costs of distribution  remain too high.   The President of the Board of Trade agrees that the cost of distribution must take a prominent place in any trade review.   The Govern- ment has applied itself vigorously to this problem  and has had prepared the  Consumers&apos; Council Bill.  The Economic Advisory Council is now engaged in enquiry into the present system of marketing and distributing consumable commodities in  the light of the widening spread  between the cost  of living index and the wholesale price level.   19. The part  that the Banks are to play  in the regeneration of industry is only lightly sketched.  Their aid is to be enlisted and their sense of responsibility stressed.  In addition they are to be asked to institute a new banking organisation somewhat on the lines of the Continental Industrial Banks. The President of the Board of  Trade points out that the whole  question of  the relation between industry  and finance  is at  present under con- sideration by  the MacMillan Committee, and  that any discussion of these particular  proposals  must be  of a purely tentative character.  Subject to  this  qualification, the Liberal criticisms of the existing system appear to him to be unfair.   20. The directions in which Mr. Lloyd  George suggests that the State can  assist are many.   He advocates (1) A  reduction by 10 per cent, in State expenditure ;  (2) An alleviation in the burden of the National Debt ;  (3) The granting  of relief of taxation on enterprise ;  (4)   The  restoration  of Trade Facilities ;  (5)  The expansion of  the Export Credits Guarantee  Scheme  ;  (6)  The development  of  the Empire ;   (7) The  assistance  of industrialinvention and research ;  (8) The encouragement in certain direc-tions of concerted action by industrialists.   21. (1) With  a view to obtaining advice as to the manner inwhich the contemplated reduction in state expenditure estimated at  48 millions can best be achieved Mr. Lloyd George proposes
the appointment of a new Geddes Committee.  While it is common ground that a reduction of State expenditure is urgently  needed,the  Chancellor  of  the   Exchequer  finds himself  unable  toaccept either the suggestion of a  Geddes  Committee  or  thepossibility of a cut in expenditure of the order of  48 millions.He points out that  Mr. Lloyd  George&apos;s calculation  of  possiblesavings is quite mistaken,  and he refers  to  the very  smalleconomies in the region of social services accepted by Mr. LloydGeorge himself on the Geddes report  in 1922, when  the oppor-tunities  for  economy were far greater.   In  so far  as  the anticipated reductions are to be sought in administrative  costs,the most ruthless pruning could not  produce more than  a  smallfraction of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s total.  The Chancellor agrees withthe view  that administrative costs  can and must be reduced,but he  is of opinion that progress in that  direction can best be achieved by  those responsible for the various branches ofGovernment  business.  If a reversal or modification of policy isalso contemplated, in directions such as those of social insurance,housing and education, then it is, in  the Chancellor&apos;s submission,inconceivable that the task of review should be entrusted  to an outside body such as that proposed.   22. (2) On the question of alleviating the debt burden,  Mr.Lloyd George&apos;s intentions are obscure.  Both short term and longterm  money rates have fallen the former more  swiftly than thelatter and the Chancellor finds  the  prospects for  conversionoperations in the future undeniably good, if they  are not impairedby the adoption of ill-advised expenditure proposals.   23. (3) In  discussing  the relief  of taxation  on  enterpriseMr. Lloyd George proceeds from the  assumption that taxationrestricts  enterprise to the  proposal that reliefs  should be  intro-duced in  respect of  capital expenditure on re-equipment.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer rejects the assumption (quoting theColwyn Committee in his  support) and points out with regard tothe proposal,  that the existing  system under which, if  modernmachinery is substituted  for obsolete plant,  the cost of the oldplant, less scrap value, may be charged forthwith against profits,is the full measure of the relief that can be justified.   24. (4) Mr.  Lloyd  George&apos;s  proposal in regard  to  TradeFacilities is in essence a  plea for assistance to private enterpriseas distinct from public utility undertakings.  The Chancellor is opposed  to this  policy,  which  the Government have  alreadyrejected,  mainly on  the  grounds that  Government credit  wouldin effect  be employed to bolster up inefficient concerns ;  that toassist individual firms at the expense of their competitors confersno  benefit on industry as a whole ;  that reorganisation withinindustry would be delayed by encouraging hope of escape fromthe necessity of cutting  out dead wood.  All that is most  useful in the old Trade Facilities  Scheme has in fact been adopted and extended in other ways.    25. (5) In connexion with an extension of the Export credits guarantee system Mr. Lloyd George (who does  less than justice to the work already accomplished) makes in effect two sugges-tions: First, that  greater  risks should be run.   The President ofthe Board of Trade points out that the business, conducted as itis at present, is run at an annual loss, which is now in the aggregate 70,000, and that the extension  of the margin of risk would onlymean a   very small  marginal  increase of trade.  Second, that special encouragement, should be given through  the machineryof  the scheme to trade with Russia.   The  President indicates that  here again Mr. Lloyd George is making suggestions oninadequate information.   The Export  Credits Guarantee Schemewas  extended to  Russia in  August,  1929,  since  when  theDepartments contracts covering exports to Russia have exceededin  amount those for all other  countries put together.   On  any reasonable terms little more could possibly be done in this  field.
   26. (6) A vigorous policy of Empire development is urged onthe Government.  So  far as the Dominions  are  concerned theSecretary of State draws attention to the difficulty of pressingcapital development on autonomous  States.  The advancement of Empire Trade has, of course, been  under consideration by theImperial Conference.  In the case of the Colonial Empire, one ofthe first steps of the Government was to make available for theColonies generous facilities for capital  development, of  which full use is being made.   27. Through the machinery of the Empire Marketing Boardan intensive propaganda for the stimulation of Empire trade isbeing conducted and research work for the scientific developmentof Empire industries is being pursued.   2S. (7) Mr. Lloyd George suggests that for the furtherance ofinvention and research in industrial  problems and processes, a central institution on the lines of the  Mellon Institute in Americashould be established.  The Lord  Presidents view is that theexisting research organisation, which  operates on the principle of promoting and assisting research associations formed to serve thespecial needs of individual industries, is better suited to our nationalconditions ;  and he considers that the requirements of the various industries in this respect are more adequately met in Englandthan in America.   29. (8) Mr. Lloyd George concludes his  proposals  for Stateintervention to restore industry by making  proposals  as to the better collection and  use of statistics, and the advancement of standardisation. The President of the Board of Trade shows what has been and is being done in both these directions.  The suggestionthat so far  as statistics  are concerned  British industry has towork largely in the dark is seen from the voluminous official statistics published to be  quite unfounded.  It is true that some industries, through fear of an extension of Government activities and of disclosing information to trade rivals, have shown reluctance to co-operate with the Board of Trade in the voluntary collectionof statistics, and the President will  continue to  do everything possible to overcome their reluctance.   30. The  President agrees that there is room for progress instandardisation and simplification, though he finds that there aredifficulties in this country not present in others.  He, in conjunctionwith standardisation organisations here and in the Dominions, ispressing  on with the work.   31. As an earnest of  the Government&apos;s desire  to assist tradeand industry in this country the President draws attention to thecreation  of  the  Overseas Trade Development Council, to theGovernments  policy  of  despatching trade  missions and ofparticipating in trade exhibitions.                   Revival of Agriculture.   32. So much for  industry  proper.  Mr.  Lloyd George thenproceeds to elaborate his scheme  for the revived of agriculture,the  condition  of  which  he  finds utterly  deplorable.  Hisargument briefly appears to be this :  no revival can come underthe present land owning and tenancy system since landlords are for the most part too impoverished to put the necessary capitalinto the  land.  Equally revival is impossible so long  as costs ofproduction  remain at their present  level.   To overcome  thesetwo difficulties he proposes to place on  the land (the State tocarry  out   work of  reconditioning  where  necessary),  100,000family farmers employing no hired labour.  The average extent ofeach farm is to be 30 acres.   33. The  Minister  of   Agriculture   cannot   accept   Mr.Lloyd George&apos;s  view  of the condition of agriculture  as a whole,and is of the opinion that the use of the family farm is muchmore limited than appears to be  suggested.   He points out thatthe success  of past small holdings schemes has turned maiidy onthe extremely careful selection of land and personnel, and that the
time limit introduced by Mr.  Lloyd George for the completionof a scheme of the magnitude  contemplated would  render quite impossible the  exercise  of anything  approaching  the  samediscrimination.  Further, the  Liberal scheme would  inevitablydisplace  a very large number  of  farmers and farm workers apoint which Mr. Lloyd George overlooks.  Finally, his analysis ofthe finance of the scheme and of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s estimate of theeffect on agricultural employment  shows both to be inaccurate.   34. The Ministers proposals for small holdings contemplate a steady development on  the  maximum scale compatible  withthe careful selection and preparation both of land and of tenant,and the  simultaneous  establishment at  suitable  centres ofdemonstration farms and holdings.&apos;   35. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s scheme is directed mainly to capturingthe home  market  and as  additional aids in this  direction headvocates  (1)  the  provision  of  improved  credit  for  farmers,(2) better systems  of marketing, (3) propaganda  to stimulateconsumption of home products, and (4) improvements in transport facilities.   36. (1) The Minister points  out that  the Agricultural CreditsAct, 192S, gives farmers ready access  to  long  term credit on terms  which compare favourably with  Overseas countries,  andthese facilities have been extensively used.  It gives access toshort term credit on the same terms as apply to other individualborrowers.   Special facilities are  to be provided for unemployedput on the land under the Ministers&apos;s proposals.   37. (2) The Minister shares the view that there is considerableroom for  improvements in marketing and he lately introduced the Agricultural Marketing Bill with this object in view.  though he is not entirely  out  of  sj^mpathy with Mr.  Lloyd  George&apos;proposal  that the  initiative in this matter should  be entrusted to some statutory authority, he had thought it best to leave theinitiative with the farmers,  in the belief, to which the experienceof his Department lends support, that their organisations will themselves and on their own responsibility adopt a constructivepolicy.   The question is. however, being further explored.    3S. (3) The  Minister agrees  that  the  stimulation of theconsumption of home produce is a valuable aid to the agricultural industry but he disagrees with the view that little has been donein this direction.  The work of the Empire Marketing Board andthe operation of the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing)Act have contributed substantially  to this end, and recently theGovernment made  a grant of   55,000  for advertising  NationalMark Produce.    39. (4) In discussing agricultural transport facilities, Mr. LloydGeorge suggests that  railway  rates  for  home produce shouldbe reduced and that an extensive programme of improvement of rural roads, involving an initial cost of between  20 million and 30 million, should be undertaken.    40. It is  clear  that lower railway rates would be of benefitto agriculture, though no doubt some of the savings  would find their way to the distributors.   The Minister of Transport and theMinister of Agriculture find, however, that the difficulties in theway of a reduction are formidable.  Unless the railway companies are  prepared  to sacrifice income, which they can at present  illafford to do, a reduction in rates could only be effected if preferencewere given to home produce at the expense of imported  produce,or if rates for non-agricultural products were increased,  or if theState made good the loss to the Railways.  All three  courses are open to  the gravest objections.    41. So far as rural roads are concerned, the view of the Ministerof Agriculture and of the Minister  of Transport is that, thoughmany miles are susceptible of improvement,  Mr. Lloyd  George&apos;sproposals would be  incapable of  justification on traffic grounds and would be  in many areas detrimental to  the  interests  of
agriculture.  The making of a road fit for sustained motor trafficmakes it unfit, in general, for use by horses and cattle.  The haulagefrom  farms is on the whole  light,  and if there comes a  revival of agriculture involving an increase in agricultural traffic, the posi-tion would and  should be met by  the organisation of collectingdumps,  etc.,  on main roads.  Where, for the purpose of speciallyheavy traffic, such as timber and sugar  beet, an improvement in rural roads has been called for, the necessary work has been  putin hand.   42. The special position of Scotland in relation to agriculture is dealt  with in a separate note by the Secretary of State.              Emergency Works of Development.   43. Pending  the regeneration  of industry  and agriculture,Mr. Lloyd George looks to an emergency programme of works ofnational development, comprising work on (1) roads and bridges,(2) regional development and housing,  (3) telephone expansion,(4) electrical  development,  and  (5) docks and  harbours,  tocontribute substantially to the relief of unemployment.   44. (1) Roads and Bridges.  Apart from the creation of certainnew arterial roads, the Minister of Transport finds that the chiefdifference between  Mr,  Lloyd Gcorge&apos;s  and  the governments proposals is in respect of the rate at which works can be put inhand and completed and in regard to the amount of employment to be afforded.   45. The  Minister points out that the  Government are main-taining  insistent pressure on  highway authorities with a view toexpediting  the execution of  works, but  that the difficulties inthe way are real and substantial.  The enormous developments inour highway system that have taken place since the war make it increasing  difficult to  persuade  those primarily concerned ofthe economic justification for expediting further large works.Attempts to force the pace involve substantial risk of piling upcosts, with repercussions on  other costs of production,  and the simultaneous execution of works on a number of roads,  bridgesand level crossings in any area would result in serious dislocation of traffic.   46. Mr.  Lloyd  George suggests that special  inducements,either by way of the grant of a bonus on works completed withina specified  time.or of loans free of interest, might be offered tolocal authorities. The Minister sets out the grave disadvantageswhich the  adoption  of the  first  alternative would involve  andthe limited possibilities of the second.   47. With the proposal to create certain new arterial roads theMinister of Transport is  unable to agree.  Apart altogether from financial considerations,  competition with the  railways, alreadysufficiently wasteful, would be intensified and no justification couldbe found for the duplication of many miles of existing roads whichhave recently been brought up to a high standard.   48. The Minsiter  of Transport observes that Mr. Lloyd Georgeestimates that the expenditure of   1 million on road and bridgework  will provide 5,000  man-years of work.  His  experience hasshown that 4,000 man-years of work is a far more accurate figure.   49. (2)  Regional  Development  and  Housing.   Mr. LloydGeorge&apos;s proposals  embrace  the rapid  advancement  of  regional planning and the creation of garden cities and satellite towns.With the objects which Mr. Lloyd George has in mind the Ministerof Health has no quarrel. So far as regional planning is concerned,a number of regional committees have already been established in the main at the Ministry&apos;s instance and every effort is beingmade to increase their number.  Many of these committees haveissued reports.  Mr. Lloyd George is, however, wrong in supposing that there are in existence a  number of approved regional planswaiting  to be put into execution and capable of absorbing 150,000
men within a year.  In fact, a  regional plan in not a scheme ofwork at all. It is a mere schedule of conditions to which futured development must conform.   50. The establishment of garden cities, can only be justifiedif there is a reasonable probability that industry will be attractedto the site.  The  Minister gives reasons  for thinking that this condition could not at the present time be satisfied.   51. It is the Governments  hope that one result of regional planning  will  be the  encouragement  of  the  building by localauthorities of satellite towns.   The Government  have hithertorelied on local authorities to provide houses and have left to those authorities the  selection of sites which they consider best suitedfor the purpose.  The Minister cannot see his way to propose a reversal of that policy.   52. A separate note by the Secretary of State on regional development in Scotland is included.   53. (3) Telephones.  Mr.  Lloyd  George&apos;s  view is that,  byimproved salesmanship, the annual intake of subscribers could beincreased from the present 125,000 per annum to 300,000 perannum and that, in anticipation of the increase, a large programmeof construction employing  60,000 men should  be put in hand atonce.  The Postmaster-General states that the  available dataindicate  that expansion on anything like the scale contemplatedis  at present unobtainable  and  he points out that, if &quot;his view is correct, the premature construction of sufficient plant to meetthat expansion would saddle the service with  heavy charges for interest and depreciation,  for which the consumer or the state would have to pay.  Moreover, at the conclusion of the period of artificial expansion, the whole of the telephone industry would be involved in disorganisation and hardship.   54. The Postmaster-General rejects the proposal in Mr. LloydGeorge&apos;s  memorandum that the  telephone  service  should be handed over to a new public corporation.   55. (4) Electrical Development.  The  Minister of Transportagrees with the view that a more  comprehensive and vigorousselling policy by the undertakers is required.  He does not, how-ever, think that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposed conference would serve any useful purpose  and  that for two  reasons.   First, in encouraging the adoption  by undertakers of  two part  tariffs,assisted wiring  and extended facilities for hire  and hire purchase,he is already actively engaged in  giving effect  to  various ofMr.  Lloyd George&apos;s suggestions.   Secondly,  undertakers havebeen subjected during recent years  to constant pressure and it isto be  doubted whether a  further  appeal by way of  a general conference would produce  any  response.   56. Docks and Harbours.   The  Minister of Transport agreesgenerally with Mr. Lloyd George on the importance of increasingthe  efficiency of our docks and harbours, and since the present government took office improvement works to a value of no lessthan  10 million have been approved under the Home development act.   There  is, however,  one  important limiting consideration which Mr. Lloyd George appears to overlook in his proposals foran all-round development of port facilities, namely, that expendi-ture on improvements which succeed merely  in diverting traffic form one port to another is uneconomic.  Accordingly the portsmost favourably situated  for  various classes  of  traffic are the ports on which effort should be concentrated.   It is this policywhich the Government are pursuing.   57. Mr. Lloyd George  concludes his  memorandum with anestimate of the reduction in unemployment likely to result fromthe adoption of his proposals and an estimate  of their net cost.   58. On the  employment side  Mr.  Lloyd  George hopes  to&apos;provide work at the  end of twelve  months for 755,000 persons.The Minister of Labour has analysed the figures of the Live Register,and it is clear that  the number of persons now in the ranks ofthe unemployed for whom emergencey work of the nature indicated
and under the conditions necessarily involved would be suitable,would fall far short of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s  total.  She points outfurther that the problem of the gradual transfer back to industry of those employed on the proposed emergency schemes, assuming that  employment and  suitable  labour were available,  is leftuntouched.   The Minister of Labour draws attention to a further point towhich no consideration  seems to have been given in the LiberalMemorandum.  A forced expansion of production on the scalecontemplated would inevitably drive up costs and that at themoment  when the Government, on  Mr.  Lloyd George&apos;s plan,should be actively engaged in persuading industry to reduce costs.   59. The  proposals  for financing Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s schemes are dealt with exhaustively by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.They focus on the flotation of a  State loan of the order of  250millions.  The Chancellor finds that the raising of a loan for thepurposes indicated  would violate the  principles  governing ex-penditure financed by way of  loan as distinct from expenditurefinanced out of revenue. The  Government would be justified in raising a loan, even of reasonable  amount,  only if  the  State hadgood economic grounds  for undertaking additional developmentworks by its own agency  and from  its  own resources.   the memoranda  by the various  Ministers  concerned indicate clearly that no such grounds exist for any scheme on  the scale proposed.   60. Mr.  Lloyd George entertains no doubt as to the Govern-menfs ability to raise the money required upon reasonable terms.In the Chancellor&apos;s view the extravagance  of  the proposals itselfproves the contrary.   As  to  the repercussions  on finance andindustry, the Chancellor gives reasons for thinking that  theywould be both profound and harmful.
(Note bythe Ministerof Labour.)                                   PART II.                        Suggested General Remedies.                        SECTION  1.-INDUSTRY&apos;S PART.                               National Conference.  .              1. The recommendation is made  that the Government should          call a conference of all concerned in industry, including employers,          trade unionists, bankers and distributors, should place a general          report on the industrial position  before them and ask them to          determine how &quot; within a few months &quot; a reduction of the order          of 10 per cent, in the costs of production can be secured.              2. It is  doubtful whether the problem  can be  dealt  with          effectively by this means, or whether such  a  conference would          accelerate progress.   It could,  and  would,  concern itself  only          with  general  propositions.   The  employers&apos;  representatives or          many of them would advocate protection and wage reduction.          The trade unionists  would seek  to  discuss the possibilities of          Government action  in  directions  which would arouse  acute          controversy with other.interests represented.  The memorandum          seems to contemplate that the conference should evolve proposals          for dealing with such questions as the efficiency of management,          the cost and efficiency  of distribution, the comparative level of          costs in sheltered and unsheltered industries, the removal of trade          union restrictions in so  far as they exist and are hampering, and          the elimination of vested interests  and prejudices.  Even if it          were possible to secure common assent to any general propositions          on such subjects as these, it is not  obvious what help would be          given to the securing of reduction of costs  in individual industries.          The problem varies very widely from industry to industry.   For          example, in Iron and Steel or Shipbuilding, where profits  have          disappeared, and the lower-rated  workmen are earning in a full          week no more than  from 42s. 45s., any reference  to  a 10 per          cent, cut would be received with surprise.  The position may be          very different in some of the &quot; services,&quot; but it is by no means          probable that they would be induced in such a conference even to          accept the general proposition that there should be a reduction in          the remuneration of capital and labour.              3. The process of internal adjustment in an industry must be          carried out by the industry itself.   Machinery for securing  it          exists in all the  important industries, and the  process has been          going on steadily during recent years and is still continuing.  There          is no reason to think that the process in individual industries can          be accelerated by spectacular action such  as is proposed ;  indeed,          the calling  of a  conference might   well retard the process by          encouraging  employers  and  workmen  to  concentrate  upon          generalities rather than upon the possibility  of putting their own          house in order.              4. The experience of the Industrial Conference of 1919 is not           encouraging.  It is doubtful whether any of those who took part           in it would willingly repeat the experiment.                                Cost  of Distribution.(Note by       5. The Government agree that in any review of trade conditions the         tne question  of  the cost of distribution  must take a prominenttiT^a^d^ Place-  and they appreciate  the  widespread feeling that  retailof Trade.)   prices have not been falling as fast as they should in view of the           fall in wholesale prices.  The question is, however, one in regard           to which there is at the moment very little material  on which           to form a considered opinion.  The comparison suggested in the           Memorandum between the cost of living figures of the  Ministry           of Labour  and  the  Board of Trade Index of wholesale prices           does not take one very far,  because the two sets of figures do           not really  relate to comparable  commodities.  Those  included           in the  Board of Trade Index arc mainly raw materials ; only a           few semi-manufactured goods,  and  those of a relatively simple
kind (e.g., cotton sheeting) are included.  The Ministry of LabourIndex includes, besides foodstuffs, many manufactured articlessuch as clothing, boots, pottery and the like, as well as items suchas house rent  and fares.  There is reason  to believe that the wholesale prices of finished goods have  not varied in the same manner as  those of raw materials, and this question is  at present being investigated by the Board of Trade.   6. The  figures  for articles of  food  alone have recently* beenanalysed by Professor  Bowley  for the years  1924-30  (May).The  result of  this analysis  is to show that retail prices maynormally be expected to respond to the  movements of wholesale prices at an interval of two months in the  proportion of 4 to 5, andthat in fact the departures from this relation in the period inquestion have  been relatively slight.   7. But even if  it should be found that the fall of retail  prices has not been lagging unduly behind the fall of  wholesale  prices in recent years, there can be  little doubt that on the  whole thedistributors&apos; margin expressed as a percentage of the retail pricetends to be greater nowadays  than it was a generation ago.  Theincrease in the  distributors&apos; margin may be due to any or all ofthree causes :         (a)  Distributors&apos; costs may have risen  more than  those     of manufacturers.   In so far as wages  account for a larger     proportion of distributors&apos;  than  of manufacturers&apos;  costs,     this may be true, and it is probably  also true that the wages     included in distributors&apos; costs are to a  greater extent those     paid in the &quot; sheltered &quot; trades, which have risen more than     those paid in the &quot; unsheltered.&quot;        (b)  Distributors may  be  better organised or more skilled     in bargaining  than  in earlier years, and  thus able to do their     buying and selling  more efficiently.        (c)  Distributors  may be  performing  more services  than     they did in the past, so  that there is more value for money     in the  price of retail articles  than used to be the case.   8. The  general conclusion seems to be (1) that far more in-formation is needed than is at present  available, and (2) that thequestion is one which should be kept continuously under review.   9. Numerous commissions and  committees appointed  sincethe war have  pointed  to the need for  careful  investigation of costs of distribution and in particular  the Royal Commission on food Prices recommended that  there should be a body  &quot; per-manently in being to watch over the supply of essential foodstuffs.&quot;In accordance  with this recommendation the Food Council wasappointed  by  the Conservative  Administration  in July,  1925,&quot; to investigate questions relating to the supply or price of articlesof food of  general consumption.&quot;  The  Food Council have hadno statutory basis and in some cases have been unable to obtain information required for the performance of their functions, while their recommendations have more than once been ignored by the traders   concerned.   The Government  are, therefore, askingParliament to set up a permanent statutory body to be called the consumers&apos; Council which shall have compulsory powers to obtain information as  to  the production, distribution, supply and priceof articles of general consumption.   It is proposed that the field of enquiry of  the Consumers&apos; Council  shall cover in the firstinstance not only foodstuffs but also fuel  and clothing, and power will  be  taken  to enlarge the field as  may  be  necessary.   It isfurther  proposed that in  cases where excessive prices  appear tobe charged and where competition is restricted the Council mayrecommend, and the Board of Trade (if all other means fail) maymake, statutory orders  fixing a maximum price.   10. Pending the passage of such legislation  a Committee ofthe Economic Advisory Council has been  set up &quot;to examine andreport on the present system of marketing and distributing con-sumable commodities, in the light of the widening spread between        * See Lloyds Bank Monthly Review, June, 1930.
           the cost  of living index and the wholesale price level;  and to           initiate special investigations to  ascertain what economies might           be effected in particular trades by reorganisation.&quot;  Among the           subjects  to which  the committee have  been directing  their           attention are possible economies in regard to the purchase and           storage of domestic coal, and the  effect of advertising in increasing           distributive costs :  in addition a detailed inquiry is in progress           into the economies of multiple shops compared with small separate           businesses.                      SECTION 2. THE  BANKERS&apos;  PART.                             Suggested Industrial Bank.(Note by        ll. The Joint Stock Banks are criticised (pp. 21 and 27) on thePresident of 8round that, while they have a measure of  control over industry the Board   through their loans and overdrafts, the management is deficient inof Trade    commercial experience and  vision.  The Banks are thus &quot;Said to           have become a &quot;dead hand upon development,&quot;  rather than a           factor making for increased efficiency.  The proposal made is that           &quot; their aid should be enlisted and their sense of responsibility           stressed.&quot;  The steps which  it is proposed that  the Banks should           be urged to take are set out on pages 27 and 28.  It is stated that           Britain is not so well served as  its competitors in the financing           of new and the development of existing enterprises ; that,  while           the formation of Securities Management Trust and the Bankers           Industrial  Development  Company   implies  some  recognition           of this deficiency, these institutions  are intended  only for the           rationalisation  of &quot; whole  industries&quot; ;   and that  the  State           should call together  those best able to help, including the  &quot; Big           Five,&quot; with a view  to the formation of  an  Industrial Bank to           finance individual concerns.  This Bank is not to be a &quot; State           Institution,&quot;  which presumably  means that the State is not to           provide  capital, but  the  proposal on page 28  to reintroduce           trade facilities  (which  is being separately  dealt  with) seems           somewhat inconsistent with  this.               12. The whole question  of  the relations  between  industry           and finance stands referred to a most expert  Committee under           the chairmanship of Lord  MacmhTan, to  which  no reference           whatever is made in this connexion in the Liberal memorandum ;           and it would not  be desirable  that any Government action of           the kind proposed should be taken until their  recommendations           have  been considered.  For the same  reason  the comments           which follow are put forward with all reserve ;  no  conclusive           judgment on these matters  can properly be reached until the           views of the  Committee are available.               13. If the policy of the Banks during the post-war  period           has been open to criticism, it would be presumably on the ground           that until recently they were too ready to give accommodation,           without  sufficiently  full investigation of  the possible  need for           reorganisation,  to  old and valued  customers whose position           had up to then been satisfactory.  If they erred in this respect,           they erred in common with all who  hoped that the depression           which followed the boom of 1919-20 would soon be over.  Those           once almost  universal hopes have been falsified and the Banks           find themselves with large  outstanding loans  which it is very           difficult  to liquidate.               14. No doubt the Banks, like everyone else, have learned by           bitter experience,  and evidence  that  they  have an appreciation           of the needs of the present situation is to be found in the support           given by the Joint Stock Banks to the Bankers Industrial Develop-           ment Company, on the Advisory Council of which all the principal           Banks are represented.  Any  suggestion that  the &quot; sense  of           responsibility &quot; of the Banks needed to be &quot; stressed &quot;  would be           strongly and justly resented  ; but it must be remembered that then-           primary responsibility is  to the depositors who  have entrusted           them with the funds which, for reasons indicated in the paragraph           which follows, it is their business to keep in a liquid form.               15. The proposed  Industrial Bank  would  be somewhat on           the model of the Continental Banks, by  which it  is no  doubt           inspired.  The criticism that the British Joint Stock Banks are
less suited to industrial needs than  the  Continental, and  par-ticularly the German,  Banks  is not new.  That  the GermanBanks have taken a more active part in the provision of fixed capital for industry than the  British Joint Stock Banks is wellknown.  One reason for this was the absence as compared  withthe United Kingdom of other kinds of financial institutions towhich industry could  have recourse  for  the  raising of  capital.Whether the very close control of industry  by bankers which such  a system involves would be  suited  to our national geniusis open to question ; but in any case there are more cogent reasonsagainst such an  innovation.   The system of deposit bankingand payment by cheque has been developed  in this country toa very much greater extent and earlier  than on the continent and by far the greatest part of the funds of the Banks are derivedfrom  deposits which are repayable either on demand or at  very short  notice.  It  is necessary for the security of the depositorsthat the  funds which they have thus entrusted to their bankersshould be kept sufficiently liquid by investment in easily realisablesecurities ;  and the banking position  would become unsoundif a large proportion of these funds were locked up in the provisionof fixed  capital for industry.   The fact that  public  issues  were contemplated at a later stage would  not  remove this objection,although tending to limit the  amount of a Bank&apos;s money lockedup in  industry at any one moment.   If the present position  were open  to  criticism, it would not be on the ground that more ofthe Banks&apos; funds should be invested in fixed capital for industry,but  that,  owing  to  the  unforeseen length  of  the post-wardepression, too great a proportion of their funds has beome lockedup in frozen overdrafts and advances.   16. Because it is not a proper function of the  Joint StockBanks to provide fixed capital for  industry, it  by  no  meansfollows that there is no source from  which such capital can be derived.  In the first place, it is not a fact that Securities Manage-ment  Trust and the Bankers&apos;  Industrial Development Companycan deal  only with whole industries.   There is no such limitationin the Articles of Association of the former, and the latter isprepared to deal with regional schemes.  The  Lancashire CottonCorporation, which controls only a fraction of one section of thecotton industry, has received the financial backing of the Bankof England.  But apart from these bodies there are a number offinance  houses in  the  City  which  constitute  the recognisedmachinery for issues of capital to the  investing public.  these institutions  are perfectly capable of  dealing with industrialissues, including  the provision of money until such  time  as apublic issue can be made. It may be noticed that,  in the caseof the B.I.D.C., the expressed intention is that, when a scheme has been approved, the provision of  the  necessary  moneys willtake place &quot; through existing agencies.&quot;   17. The  late Lord  Privy Seal  was authoritatively informedthat no  sound scheme  had failed  to  make progress  for lack offinance ;  and certain proposals, which, when put before the  City,were  not regarded  as  comprehensive rationalisation schemessuitable  for the special institutions  set  up to deal with  such schemes, but which were nevertheless considered likely to resultin a hopeful scheme, have been passed on to other City interestswho could deal with the  matter.  These have been proposals relating  to concerns of some  magnitude.   In the case of lesserconcerns, on a scale too small to interest a finance house in theCity,  it is often said that there is a gap in the financial machine,and that there are no channels by which a relatively small amountof fixed capital can be obtained at reasonable cost.  This class of case is likely to engage the attention of the Macmillan Committee,and their Report must  be awaited before any definite view canbe formed upon it.  Generally speaking, however, the information available, together with the cheapness of  money and the rise inthe price of gilt-edged stocks, suggest that the deficiency is nota deficiency of money or of means to examine proposals requiringmoney, but of opportunities for profitable investment in industry
                       SECTION  HI. THE  STATE&apos;S PART.                               National  Expenditure.(Note by       18. In this part  of the Liberal memorandum it is stronglyChancellor   ur&amp;ed tnat the Government at the same time that it is stressingof the       trie importance of economy in industry, should simultaneouslyExchequer.) pledge itself to reduce its own costs by 10 per cent.  This should           &quot; not only include savings resulting from change in policy, such,           for instance, as savings resulting  from further disarmament as           this can be brought about, but should also include savings in the           cost  of carrying out existing policies.&quot;  As the Government are           asking industry to  secure an  end which may mean temporary           reductions in remuneration of different grades,  so at the same           time Government  Servants should be set the task of reducing           costs and should realise that failure means reduced remuneration.              The authors of the Memorandum recommend accordingly that           the Government should at once appoint a small committee of           business men, to report within 6 months, with the same terms of           reference as the  Geddes Committee, namely, &quot; To make recom-           mendations  to  the Chancellor of the Exchequer for effecting           forthwith  all possible reductions in the national expenditure on           Supply Services, having regard especially to the present  and           prospective position of the revenue &quot; and (the memorandum would           add) &quot; to the effect of the present burden of taxation in restricting           industry and employment.&quot;              The memorandum then gives  some  quite general  statistics           which in the view of its authors indicate that large economies ought           to be possible.              19. In present circumstances,  I agree that economy  is  a           necessity and the memorandum performs a most useful service by           drawing attention so forcibly to the matter.  It is in the application           of the principle that I  find the memorandum wanting.              In the first place, is the proposed cut 10 per cent, of the total           Budget expenditure (involving a saving of some  80 millions) or           10 per cent, on the cost of Supply  Services  (involving a saving of            48  mdlions) ?  As almost the whole of the expenditure other than           that on Supply Services is on national debt services it is clear that           the whole reduction would have to fall on  Supply Services, even           if expressed as a percentage of the total budget.              Thus it is not clear whether Supply Services are to be cut by            80  millions (10 per cent, of the Budget) or  48 millions (10 per           cent, of their own cost).              20. The Memorandum draws  attention to  an  increase of           about  60 millions in  the cost of the Supply Services  between           1923 and 1930.   That increase is at first  sight surprising  and,           indeed, alarming ;  and  the  memorandum is quite justified in           adding that it has taken place  despite substantial automatic           savings on War Pensions.              But there are two facts not stated in the Memorandum which           must at once be pointed out; (a) the recent  De-rating Scheme           increased the total of the Supply Services by  46 millions ; (6) an           increase of  11 millions in the cost  of the Post Office has also been           included in  the  figures in the Memorandum.   The De-rating           Scheme has increased  the Supply Services by   31  millions on           account of the new Block Grants  and by a further  15  millions,           representing a transfer to Parliamentary Votes of sums formerly           paid from the Consolidated Fund through the old Local Taxation           Accounts.   This  latter transaction is a pure matter  of book-           keeping and there is no  increased charge to the taxpayer.   The           increase of  31 millions on  account of Block  Grants is  new           expenditure so far as the taxpayer is concerned, but they were           part of a scheme of which, at any rate, the intention was to assist           agriculture and productive industry by reducing one of their most           onerous burdens, viz.,  local rates.  As regards  the Post Office,           its revenue  has  increased  during the  period  in  question by            17^ millions;  its expenditure has increased by  11  millions;           the  ratio of expenditure to  revenue has constantly fallen.  In           these  circumstances it would  seem  unreasonable to treat the           increase in Post Office costs as though it were an increase in dead           weight expenditure.
   It appears at once therefore that of the  60 millions increasereferred to in the Memorandum,  31 millions represents the newBlock Grants under the De-rating Scheme,  15  millions is a merebook-keeping  transfer,  and   11 millions  is  an increase on PostOffice  expenditure, much  more  than  balanced by  increase in revenue.  It is, however, desirable to treat the matter in a littlemore detail so as to show  on broad  lines  which services haveincreased in cost and which have decreased.   The following shorttable,  which is a  comparison  of  audited expenditure  1923-24,with the original estimates  1930-31, shows  that grants for local and  other services, social insurance and  old  age pensions haveincreased by  87 millions, swamping economies effected elsewhere.

I find the memorandum very obscure on the question howfar the proposed &quot; Committee of business  men &quot; will intrude on policy.   The only example of  a question of policy which thepassage  of  &quot; Economy &quot; gives is  &quot; farther  disarmament  as  itcan be  brought about,&quot; but that illustration is too vague toserve as a guide.  (Other parts of the memorandum, it  is true,deal with policy but  only from the point  of view of advocatinglarge expenditure  on schemes which would  be the first to  come under any &quot; Geddes axe.&quot;)    In quoting the terms of reference to the Geddes Committee of1921 the memorandum omits  the reference to policy (&quot; in so faras  questions of policy are involved  in the expenditure underdiscussion, these will remain for the exclusive  consideration ofthe Cabinet; but  it will be open to the committee to review theexpenditure  and  to  indicate  the economies which might beaffected  if particular policies were  either adopted, abandoned ormodified &quot;) and thus leaves it uncertain whether a  similar con-dition should or should not be prescribed now.    22. The report recognises  that, &quot; in the immediate post-war period  there were  certain special  opportunities for reducing expenditure  not present now &quot; ; and that &quot; certain additionalburdens in relation to social and other services have been assumedwhich must  continue to be borne.&quot;  The  general inference fromthe language of the memorandum is that, apart from &quot; furtherdisarmament,&quot; there may no longer be much room  for reducing expenditure by  means of reversals of policy ; but that with the help of a committee of business men it should be possible  to makelarge savings in administrative costs.  Whether this be  a fairinference or not, it is abundantly  clear that nothing short of  a comprehensive  revision  of policy could  produce  a  saving  of 48 millions (let alone  80 millions)  and that, even  on the mostoptimistic assumptions, a reduction of administrative costs couldnot be expected to produce more than a small fraction  of this sum.f    * Note. For the  reasons given in the preceding paragraph the transferof ^15 millions from the Consolidated Fund to  Votes and the increase of l\ millions in Post  Office expenditure have been left out of account.    f Cf. on this point the finding of the Alan Anderson Committee on the pay, etc., of  State  servants, that  &quot; no power  except Parliament canmaterially reduce the load.&quot;
   Staff  charges are by far the  most  important element  in administrative costs.  Completed statistics for the financial year1929-30  show that in that year out of a total expenditure of 434 millions on Supply Services, staff charges (apart from the pay of officers and men of the fighting services) accounted in roundfigures for  88  millions, divisible as follows :                         N on-Industrial     Industrial                            Staffs.           Staffs.                            million.         million.Civil Departments            19                2Defence Departments          6               12Revenue Departments..       44 (33  P.O.       5% (almost                                  alone)           entirely                                                   P.O.)                             69               19   Of  the  total expenditure of  88J- millions, Post  Office  staffcosts accounted for no less than  39 millions.  If, for the reasons give above, this  figure be omitted from the calculation, thereis left  a total sum of less than  50 millions.   In other words,it would be necessary to scrap the whole machinery of government or the whole of the Civil Service outside the Post Office in orderto secure a  10 per cent,  reduction of supply expenditure bysavings in administrative  charges.   Staff costs are the product of (a) the numbers of staff employed and (b) the rates of remuneration  to which they are respectivelyentitled.  The  general standard  of remuneration of the  CivilService is now the subject of enquiry by a Royal Commission.There can, therefore, be no question of appointing a new committeeof business men at the present time to consider that part of theproblem.   A committee, if it were  appointed, would be limited in its enquiry to an investigation of the numbers, as distinct fromthe rates of pay of the Civil Service.   Apart from the fact that any possible economy resulting fromsavings of administrative  costs would be trivial  in  comparisonwith the total  reduction of expenditure now proposed, I am by no  means satisfied that a committee  of business  men under instruction  to  cover  the  whole  field  of Government  activitywithin a period of six months would be either the best or even asuitable instrument for an enquiry into staff costs.   The plain fact is  that progress in these matters can  best beachieved, indeed can only be achieved, by persistent, detailed and constructive effort towards improvement  in  organisation  andoffice technique on the part of those who are directly responsiblefor the various branches of Government business.  Since the Warthe investigations  carried out by departmental officers in col-laboration with officers of the Establishments Department of theTreasury, have led to important economies ;  with the result thatthe output per head  of the Civil  Service is demonstrably better to-day than it was before the War.  Much still remains to be done,and further economies are possible and must be secured.  But  Ibelieve that better results will be  achieved by continuing, and sofar as  necessary, intensifying, the  pressure of the existing systemthan  by the alternative plan  now suggested.   A  Committee of outside persons with the means and in the time at its disposalcould  not hope to diagnose  the  problem, much  less to deviseappropriate improvements in technique.  A cursory survey, for it could be no more, might indeed tend, so far from saving costs,merely, for the time  being, to create unnecessary work.    23.  The  present  position  of  the  Supply  Services  (original estimates, 1930, excluding Post Office   60 millions) is:      Grants for Local and other services   ..   138 millions.     Social Insurance  and Old Age  Pensions    79 millions.     War Pensions    ..     ..    ..     ..    52 millions.     Defence   ..      ..     ..    ..     ..   110 millions.     Tax Collection    ..     ..     ..     ..    12 millions.     Civil Services generally  ..     ..     ..     27 millions. 418 millions.
On the last three items there is plainly no hope of effecting, inthe near future, economies of the order suggested in  the Memo-randum.   I assume, further, that there is no intention  of loweringthe rate of war pensions.   In other words, it is certain from the start that the preponderating part of  the reduction must, by theforce of circumstances, fall on grants to local authorities, social insurance and old age pensions.   It is therefore essential that before deciding upon the proposalto appoint a new Geddes Committee of business men, the Govern-ment  should be informed more precisely what duties such aCommittee is to perform and should also consider what  scope therenow is  for  savings  of the  magnitude  contemplated  in  thememorandum.   24.  It must not be forgotten that  the Geddes Committee met at a time when economies were not only possible but were cryingout to  be made. The Committee now suggested would meet asthe authors of the Memorandum admit in circumstances entirely different.  The most fruitful source of investigation (the unemploy-ment insurance position) is now remitted to a Royal Commission.   It will be remembered that though the  Geddes  committee recommended cuts of  86-1- millions, only  54 millions  of this was accepted by Mr. Lloyd George in 1922.   Of  the  S6  millions, Defence accounted for  46   millions.Obviously the opportunities of effecting economy on Defence at atime when the  Estimates totalled over  200  millions  were muchgreater than they are to-day when this total is not much more than 100 millions.   The  whole  of  the  social services (Education,Health, Labour, War Pensions and Old  Age Pensions) accountedfor only   26-J- millions of the Geddes  cuts.  Even so the amountaccepted by Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Government  was reduced  to halfof this amount, viz.,  14-1 millions.   Where  the Geddes recom-mendations most involved fundamental changes of social policy e.g., on Education votes they were  least effective.  Here theirrecommended cut of  18 millions was whittled down to   61millions.   Their proposals for raising the minimum  school age,for reducing teachers&apos;  salaries,  and  for   rationing the localauthorities  were  flatly  rejected,  and   3   millions  of their&quot; saving  &quot; was  stigmatised by Sir R.  Home  as  a mere transfer from votes to rates.   If Mr. Lloyd George, with the unequalled opportunity of 1922,did not attempt a saving of more than  14-J- millions in the region of social services, and if the Defence Estimates have already fallennearly  50 per cent, since that time, it does not look as if there wouldbe much chance that even he would effect to-day anything remotelyapproaching his figure of  48 millions much less  80 millions.   To  sum up, on administration charges there is no possibilityof effecting spectacular  savings : on defence  policy the scope for large economies is overwhelmingly less to-day than it was in1922, and we may well doubt whether any committee  of businessmen would in this sphere recommend any policy saving whatever :we may  be sure that they would  not recommend a  reversal ofthe policy of de-rating.  There  would thus  remain for the newGeddes Axe the social services.   Mr. Lloyd George is a littlevague  as to his intentions in this field.  But  if he wants his business  men&apos;s committee  to concentrate on a lowering of  thegeneral standard of our social services, I emphatically  disagree.               Local Government  Expenditure.   25.  The  Memorandum proposes  that, simultaneously with  (Note by thethe appointment of the suggested new Geddes Committee,  the  ChancellorCounty Councils and local authorities generally should  be urged  Exchequer)to reduce their costs quickly by not less than 10 per cent.   The loan charges of  local authorities, though very  heavy,do not form so  high a proportion  of  their total expenses as thenational  debt forms of  the Budget.   Otherwise  their position is
           not very dissimilar from that of the State.  The services with           which they deal Education, Roads, Poor Relief, Health, Police            are all absolutely  essential  and there  is  no ground for  the           assumption that great reductions can be made without cutting           out any useful services and  without any loss of  efficiency.   It           ma3&apos;- be admitted that large  economies would be  possible by a           lowering of standards in such matters as education and health.           If the standards were lowered and economies effected there would           be some resultant economies to  the State in these  cases where           grants still remain on a percentage basis and  it might be possible           to lower Block Grants at the next revision. Moreover, a Govern-           ment  which had adopted the  drastic step of radically curtailing           its own expenditure  on social services  would, as a matter of           course, urge local authorities (usually it cannot compel  them) to           do likewise.  But, as I have already indicated in my remarks on           the suggested Geddes Committee, I am opposed to  this policy.              Short of drastic action of this character, increases in local           expenditure might be obviated by the cessation of pressure from           the centre to spend more.  But it would be difficult to  reconcile           such a change with the continual exhortations which have been           made  to local authorities, coupled with special inducements held           out to them,  in regard to unemployment works.                    Alleviation  of the Burden  of National Debt.(Note by       26. The high cost of the Debt is  referred  to and it is claimed           that courageous action, the nature of which is unspecified, would of the 0r   largely reduce the rate of interest paid by the State.Exchequer.)    It is not easy to understand to whom this criticism is addressed.           No one at  this date can possibly be unaware that a very great           reduction has been made in the  interest charge this year.  The           rate  on  interest  on  long term  securities has not  fallen with           the same breathless rapidity as the rate on  short securities,  but           from the nature of things that could not be expected.  Even  the           soundest financial policy  must have time to produce its full effect           on long  term rates.   Nevertheless  long  term rates have very           definitely fallen and the prospects for conversion operations in the           future are undeniably good.              The Memorandum continues with some criticisms as to a           policy of restricting the demand for capital.  These criticisms           appear to have no relevance to the present Government which  has           somewhat freely encouraged capital issues for constructive works.           The effect which the Liberal proposals themselves would have on           the long term rate  of interest is a consideration of  the greatest           importance and this subject  is dealt with fully at a later stage.           (See Part VI.).                        Belief of Taxation upon  Enterprise.(Note by       27. This passage of the Report  is shown by  its context to*Jje        relate to the income tax and there are two theses; the first is thatofhtheell0r   taxation operates as a great engine for the restriction of enterprise,Exchequer.) and the  second that  reliefs should  be introduced in respect of           expenditure on re-equipment.   The  conclusion is  that a Com-           mittee should be appointed to review the whole question of  the           incidence of  taxation upon enterprise, and to report ways  and           means by which the proposals advocated, if  adopted, could best           be carried out in practice.              28. So far as concerns the  allegation that direct taxation  is a           great  engine for the restriction of enterprise, I have  always been           ready to admit that in the present gloomy conditions the psycho-           logical effect of any increase of direct taxation in the  minds of           business  men would  be very serious, far greater  indeed than           would be warranted by the economics of the case.   This is  one           of the great  reasons which  makes me profoundly anxious to           avoid increases of taxation next year if the means  to avoid them           can be found.              29. But subject to this I have never agreed with the Liberal           thesis.  In 1924  the Labour Government set up  the Colw3&apos;n           Committee to enquire into the incidence of taxation on trade  and
 industry, and that committee pronounced very  definitely and very authoritatively upon this very subject.  The Minority Report, which was  signed by four members of  the  committee  broadly sharing our political views, concluded that direct taxation &quot; cannot in our judgment  reduce the aggregate purchasing power of the community, nor do  we find  that it raises prices or materially reduces  the national output of work, of saving or of enterprise.&quot; (Minority Report, p. 140.)    The  Report of the Majority, men of  great distinction but of different political thought, reached no different conclusion : &quot; We conclude with regard to enterprise that the effects of high income taxation .  .  .  over a great part of  the industrial field, while appreciable, have not been of serious  moment.  But it is clear that  they must often have put a check on the more speculative class of  business.  .  .  .  Wider causes than taxation, however, and particularly the  dislocation of our old export markets must be held  mainly responsible for the lack of buoyancy in recent years.  Relatively income taxation has not been a factor of high importance.&quot;   (Majority Report, p. 451.)    The kind of relief which would be proposed if an enquiry were authorised would be a relief of income tax on Companies&apos; reserves. This  was considered by  the Colwyn Committee.   It  was not recommended.  It is quite obvious that at the present time  I could not afford it and, even if I could, it would go in the  main to increase  the resources of wealthy corporations and would give no relief to  our most hard-pressed industries which  are making no profits and,  therefore, paying no tax.    The particular relief which the Memorandum aims at is  for the  business  man who  incurs  expenditure  on   re-equipment. &quot; Certainly &quot; the Memorandum says &quot; the regulations with regard to depreciation of plant should be modified,  and probably as an emergency measure it would be desirable to go much further in the direct encouragement  of  large scale  re-equipment.&quot;    30. People who  write  concerning  income  tax depreciation allowances nearly always do so with an amazing lack of knowledge of the actual facts.  When a business man scraps plant in order to  substitute  another machine of a more effective or modern character he is entitled to  charge against his profits the entire cost of the old machine (less its scrap value), except  so far as he has already  written it off against profits in previous years.  That fact is seldom realised.  It is a very proper allowance, but it is also a full one and nothing more can be conceded in this direction without a travesty of proper accountancy methods of  ascertaining profits.    31. Members of the Liberal Party had an amendment on this subject on the paper during the recent Finance Bill.   I disposed of it in argument.  At the same time I said that I was perfectly prepared &quot; to consider any proposal put  forward for the  same purpose&quot; free  from the  insuperable difficulties  which that particular proposal contained.    If  some  useful proposal should be  made, that would  be another matter.  In the meanwhile I see no adequate ground for having at the present time a roving enquiry into the  incidence of taxation  upon enterprise.    32. I would like to add one final observation.  The Memoran-dum  suggests that the regulations in regard to depreciation of plant for income tax purposes are inadequate.  It is significant that since 1918 there has been on the Statute Book a provisionunder which  any  industry dissatisfied  with  its  depreciationallowance can appeal through the ordinary authorities  to  anindependent body  of business  men possessing unfettered dis-cretion in this matter.   No industry has yet  thought it worthwhile to avail itself of this right.
                                   Trade Facilities.(Note by       33. Among the aids to enterprise mentioned in the Memorandumtne        reference  is made to Trade  Facilities.  &quot; Trade Facilities ....^the      on tne vv&apos;hole have fully justified  themselves, and we recommendExchequer.) that  Trade Facilities be restored,  probably in some modified           form  . .  .  .&quot;  Nothing is said of the steps taken by the present           Government to continue and  extend all  that  was found most           useful in the original Trade Facilities Scheme.   34. As  regards undertakings  in  Great  Britain, the TradeFacilities Acts were applicable to industrial concerns generally,but their most useful application was certainly to public utilitiesand the Advisory Committee, on whose recommendation guaranteeswere given, constantly urged that its operation should be restricted to public utilities.  On this the  public utility side the TradeFacilities scheme has not merely been revived but much extended and improved by  Part  1 of the Development (Loan guarantees and Grants) Act  1929.  This measure  which I observe is nowherementioned  in the Liberal Memorandum enables assistance to begiven to capital  expenditure for the development, reconstruction and re-equipment of public utilities ; the assistance may take theform  either of a State guarantee, as under the Trade FacilitiesActs, or of a continuing grant from the Exchequer  to meet for aperiod part or whole of the interest on the loan.  The scheme hasbeen mainly operative on the grants side, i.e., it was the reformwhich we introduced which has been really fruitful in acceleratingand stimulating schemes of development.   In one  year schemesinvolving nearly  28  millions of expenditure have been approved for assistance under the Act. This compares with a total of some 1S.V  millions for guarantees to domestic public utility concernsunder the Trade Facilities Acts during the six years they were inoperation.   35. We have thus made full provision for the encouragement of public utilities and the Liberal plea for the revival of TradeFacilities is reduced to  a plea for Trade Facilities  for privateenterprise.  Their plan is, however, vague.   On page 37 we are told that the State should be prepared toraise  industrial efficiency  &quot; even  by some extension of TradeFacilities or by other temporary financial help.&quot;  The extent and form of assistance is to be &quot; a matter for consideration in each case,&quot;but the following essential conditions are  laid  down :         (a) experts are to be  satisfied that  the efficiency and    competitive power of the industry will be permanently raised ;        (b) help is to be limited  in duration ;        (c) help is not to exceed in value the savings in unemploy-    ment costs resulting.   36. Terms so general as th ese do nothing to surmount the difficul-ties still entirely unsolved of finding a practicable and usefulplan.   It is easy to say that State credit should be applied to combine rationalisation and  increased efficiency with additional employment.  But rationalisation, vital as it is for combating ourdistresses, generally means less labour for given work:  it may mean the entire closing down of  an inefficient concern.  For  the timebeing it reduces employment.  How are we to overcome the logicof facts ?  Quite true, re-equipment gives  more employment forthe moment in other industries producing the modem plant thusordered.  But how are we to secure that this will counterbalancethe loss of employment in the renovated factory ?
   37. It is frankly useless to suppose that the re-introduction ofTrade Facilities can overcome these fundamental dilemmas.  Norwill  Trade  Facilities conduce  to  the  permanent  efficiency  ofindustry.  The Government have definitely declared against anextension of Trade Facilities for private enterprise, and I believethat decision was entirely right.   38. The re-equipment of a factory so as to increase its capacity to produce  goods for which there  is a ready demand does not usually present any difficulty ;  private capital is easily obtainablefor the purpose.  It  is the inefficient concern which will ask for trade Facilities,  and why  should a Labour Government bolsterup inefficient private concerns ?  If with State aid there  is anincreased production of goods without a market, no good has beendone.  The  effect of Trade Facilities was frequently to assist onefirm  in an industry at the expense of its competitors, and theincreased capacity (particularly in the shipping industry) with no useful outlet hindered trade revival and embarrassed the borrowingconcerns.   Many notable examples of this could be given.   39. Nor  would the reintroduction of Trade Facilities hastenrationalisation.  On the contrary, the re-introduction would holdup schemes already in progress,  for the promoters would  hopeby delay to obtain more  favourable terms from the  Government.They would hope to escape the cutting out of dead wood, and the elimination  of inefficient management.  It  is  not the businessof a  Labour Government to soften the hard realities of rational-isation by  making comfortable gifts  to  bankers,  creditors,  orshareholders whose money has really gone.  The steps recently taken by the  City in the  formation  of the  Bankers&apos; IndustrialDevelopment Company are beginning to have their effect andthe  reintroduction  of Trade Facilities would  only hinder themovement.   40. Trade Facilities are merely a Government guarantee for capital which a private concern desires to raise.   Given that the concern is efficient enough to be  able to raise money on its owncredit and if  it is not it should go  without it the  only value ofthe Government guarantee lies in  the difference between the rate at which the Government  can  borrow  and  that at  which theindustry can  borrow.  This margin,  once wide, is now  com-paratively  narrow, and the attraction of Trade  Facilities  to business  men  is  correspondingly  reduced.  The  authors of theLiberal Plan would no doubt meet this by saying that we should give  industries cheap capital say at 3 per cent, out of the publicpurse but  I am no advocate of  this proposal of giving public money to favoured private concerns without an atom of effectivepublic control.   41. It is worth while to add that of the  70 millions of capitalguaranteed  under the Trade  Facilities  Acts some  7 millionsonly has been repaid to date, and  the loss incurred on that  small proportion of cases is now approaching  1 million.  But for special arrangements which we were able to make, a further  2 millionsodd  might easily have fallen on the Exchequer for  payment thisyear.  The  heavy cost of  these  guarantees on  the  Exchequerand their depressing effect on Government credit are not necessarilydecisive considerations, but equally they cannot be  ignored.   42. After reviewing the whole  matter we as a Governmentpronounced definitely against  an extension of Trade facilities to private  industry when  the Development  Act  was introducedlast  year and  again in recent months when the General Councilof the Trade Union Congress raised the question with partictdarreference  to shipbuilding.   There  is  nothing  in the  LiberalMemorandum  which leads me to  doubt the wisdom  of this conclusion.   (1848C)                                                E 2
                       Export Credits.   43. The  recommendations in  the Memorandum are  veryvague, being mainly that the Government should &quot; see whethermore cannot be done &quot; and run  rather greater risks  than would normally be justifiable.  They suggest more use of the scheme forthe development of trade with Russia; and add that whateverfacilities exist  should  be  made  more  widely  known and theco-operation of the Banks should be sought.   44. This is  largely  out of date as will  be  seen  from  whatfollows :    The  Export Credits scheme has been largely altered since itsstart in 1919, as the result of the recommendations of a Committeerepresenting commercial and banking interests  which reportedin 1926.   The  amended scheme allows the Department, on the advice of the Statutory Advisory Committee to indemnify exportersagainst risk on a bill, without recourse against  the exporter, upto 75 per cent, of the amount of the bill.  The  Department also provides purely  financial facilities by guaranteeing 100 per cent.of the bill with full recourse.  The scheme is very elastic and thepremiums vary with the risk ;  and constant improvements arebeing introduced.   The scheme  recently came under full review in 1929  by aCommittee  consisting of  Sir Otto  Niemeyer, Colonel the  Hon.Sidney  Peel, and Sir William Plender, who recommended thatas the scheme was still experimental, Parliamentary authorityfor its continuance should be obtained.  In the Overseas TradeAct, 1930, it was continued to 31st March, 1935.   The Committee  further said that it was  essential  to thesuccessful conduct of the experiment that the business should be conducted on commercial lines.  They recommended the appoint-ment of a  small Executive  Committee  with powers analogous to those  of a  Board  of Directors of  a business undertaking,including authority to settle all  questions of  policy  such asreinsurance, the nature  of the risks to be insured, the details of policies to be issued and the appointment of staff, and generally to watch the daily conduct  of the business.  The government accepted  this  recommendation  subject  to  certain  reservationsin regard mainly to the preservation of Ministerial responsibility.   Until  July,  1929, trade with  Russia was excluded, but asfrom 1st  August of that year the Committee  were empoweredto consider proposals in connection with exports to Russia.   45. Turning now to  the Liberal suggestions.                (a) Greater risk  should be run.   This recommendation ignores the extent  to which the Depart-ment has gone.  Since the present scheme began in  1926,  it hascovered an increasing amount of exports every year.  The exportsassisted by the Department year by year are as follows :                                                                                                  365,000                                              2,455,000                                              4,283,000                                              5,661,000                                              5,041,000                                  Total ..  17,805,000The total deficit for the period 1st July, 1926, to 31st March, 1929,the latest date to which it is at present possible to estimate the financial results,  is likely to be about  70,000.  The facilitieshave covered a wide range of goods.  The industries which havemade the greatest use  of  them have been  cotton and woollentextiles, machinery and  coal.(Note bythePresidentof theBoardof Trade.) 9 months to the 31.3.192712 months   ,,   31.3.192812   ,,      ,,   31.3.192912   ,,      ,,   31.3.1930 6   ,,      ,,   30.9.1930
   In considering whether greater risks should be run, regard should be had to the following points :         (i) that no marked increase  in export trade is likely    to result.  The exporter carries a considerable risk in every    transaction which the Department guarantees and if the    Department  were willing  to be  less prudent,  the sound    exporter is not often likely to  be so.  The  Department    might extend the margin of risk, but the marginal increase    of trade would be very small.        (ii) more  risky transactions would lead to greater losses    abroad  and  the  resultant disposal of  bankrupt stock  on    overseas markets would be resented by the bulk of sound    British  exporters to  those  markets.   The  Chambers of    Commerce have complained  of this in  the past  and would    complain again.        (iii) An announcement that the Department was prepared    to lose  money might result  in its becoming the victim of    unsound and unsavoury   transactions  that would be  no    appreciable good to  trade.                   (b)  Trade  with Russia.   This proposal minimises the  very  considerable work whichhas been done since the present Government allowed the  schemeto be used for trade with  Russia.  Thus during the twelve month sending 30th September last, the Departments contracts coveringexports  to Russia amounted to  4,678,000 as  against  3,809,000for all other countries.  In addition the Department has offered to provide  facilities  for further exports of  about  2,000,000.This business  is still under  discussion.  The Department  isprobably giving guarantees in  connection with 60  per cent, or70 per cent, of the total exports from this country to Russia andis  evidently the primary cause of the  increase in those  exportsduring the last twelve months.   It is doubtful whether on any reasonable terms  more could possibly be done in this field.   The  example of Germany is  cited but is not altogether happy.According  to the latest information,  increased provision hasrecently been made for its existing export credits schemes whichare available both for trade with Russia and  with other countries.But the German Government  has not renewed, and shows nodisposition to  renew, the  special facilities  now expired whichit made in 1926, when it set aside  15,000,000 (increased in 1927to  18,000,000) for &quot; long&quot;  credits for Russia.                       (c) Publicity, etc.   The  next proposal is  that the facilities should be made more widely known, and co-operation with the banks is recommended.        (i) It is important to make it clear that all these questions    of  business  development  were  definitely  placed  by the    Government in the hands of an Executive Committee as from    the 1st April  last, and that body has been,  and is, actively    considering all possible means of development.        (ii) It has, for  instance, recently opened  an office  in    Bradford, following on the  opening of an office in Manchester    some time ago.        (iii) Officers of the Department  visit other leading towns    at regular intervals.        (iv) The Committee is  now considering other measures,    including  co-operation with the   banks,  for  bringing  its    facilities prominently before business men.    46. Generally, the Liberal Memorandum so far as this topic isconcerned, appears not to do justice to the facts.  The positionis that the Department is doing more and more business on sound and progressive lines.
                               Empire Development.                                   Dominions.(Note by       47.  The Liberal  Memorandum  appears  to   include  thetno        Dominions in the phrase &quot; the Colonial Empire.&quot;   It should beItat^fOTthe notecl that the application of the term &quot; colony &quot; or &quot; colonial&quot;Dominions.) to the Dominions is likely to  cause resentment and should be           avoided.   48. So far as the Dominions are concerned, it is clear that theextent to which it is possible for the United Kingdom Governmentto assist, financially or otherwise, in their development is extremelylimited.  They  are autonomous communhies, and their develop-ment is as much a domestic matter for them as, e.g., the developmentof the United  States of America is for the United  States ofAmerica.   49. In one case, however, namely that of Australia, the UnitedKingdom Government did, in 1925, agree to make a contribution of  150,000 for every  750,000 (up to a maximum of  34,000,000)advanced by the Commonwealth Government  to State Govern-ments for developmental works  approved by the  commonwealth government which appeared to the United Kingdom Governmentto be such  as  to increase the powers  of  Australia to absorbmigration from the United Kingdom.  This scheme is at presentin abeyance owing largely to the fact that, in present circumstances,no advances are likely, for some time at any rate, to be made bythe Commonwealth Government for such purposes :  in any casethe contribution made under the scheme by the United kingdom has been very much less than the maximum which was at onetime anticipated ( 1^- million as against a maximum of  7 millions),and the experience obtained of the working of the scheme has notbeen such as to encourage the idea of its extension.   50. As regards the encouragement of  Empire  trade (whichthe Liberal Memorandum appears to some extent  to confuse withEmpire development),  this is, of  course, a principal subject  ofdiscussion at the Imperial Conference now in  session.                The Empire  Marketing  Board.   51. The Empire Marketing Board was set up by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in  the  United Kingdom in   1926  to  further the marketing of Empire produce in the United  Kingdom and  toadvise the Secretary of State for  Dominion Affairs  on the expendi-ture of an annual grant placed by Parliament at  his disposal forthat  purpose.   Its  establishment  was recommended by theImperial Economic Committee.  The Board is  a  non-party body and  its membership includes representatives of  the Dominionsand&apos; of the Colonies.   The purpose  of the Empire Marketing Board is  clear and definite.  It is to improve the quality and increase the quantityof Empire products marketed in  the United Kingdom and to makeEmpire buying a national habit.   52. The  Board&apos;s  funds  have  been  devoted  to  scientific research, economic  investigation  and publicity.   Grants  underthe first of these headings  are designed  to help  in  increasingoutput, improving quality, and decreasing wastage in the Empire&apos;production .  The immense and growing power  of science to help the producer had not in the  past been so thoroughly mobilisedwithin the Empire as  elsewhere in  the world.  The Board has,therefore,  found many opportunities  for  financing  scientific research of urgent importance to  Empire Marketing.  grants under the second heading economic investigation have helped to keep producers, scattered over the Empire, in closer and moreintimate contact with the needs and tastes of  their wholesaleand retail customers in the United Kingdom. They have, further,been devoted to throwing light on what maybe termed the general problems  of orderly marketing, which present themselves with
such practical insistence to all engaged in Empire trade.  Lastly,the Board&apos;s publicity has aimed at turning the thoughts of thepublic to the theme of Empire buying.   53. Scientific research, conducted with the aid of grants fromthe Empire Marketing Fund, is  now in progress in  the UnitedKingdom, in each of the Dominions, and in numerous Colonies.The  range  of Empire industries and  commodities which  thesegrants are  designed to assist is considerable and it would be impracticable  to summarise them in any brief form.  They are set out fully in the Board&apos;s Annual Report  for 1929-30.   TheReport shows  that grants have been  made affecting animalhusbandry, breeding and health, the export of pedigree livestock,entomology,  mycology  and plant pathology, plant breeding,horticulture,  economic  botany,  dietetics, forestry,  mechanical transport, fisheries, wool, flax, dairying,  poultry,  animal ecology,agricultural meteorology,  oenology, and geophysics.   54. The Board&apos;s economic investigation includes such activitiesas the systematic  survey  of  the wastage in  imported Empirefruits.  Trade enquiries  to estimate  the extent and nature ofcompetitive supplies, and to obtain information on market require-ments in regard to quality, grading and packing, have also been undertaken.  A series of retail market surveys has been carriedout both nationally and in selected areas.   Weekly  intelligencenotes are published by the Board giving full marketing information for fresh fruit and for dairy&apos; produce.  Statistical surveys are issued of the  world position as regards  the production and consumption of various foodstuffs.   55. The Board  employs, as  means  of furthering  the sale inthe United Kingdom of Empire products from home and overseas,seven  methods of publicity7, namely:  newspaper advertisement,posters, leaflets, and display material  (including shop windowbills  and  popular leaflets), exhibitions and shopping  weeks,broadcasting lectures, and the cinema..  A  new experiment wastried  in  the first  half of  this year by the  Board in Glasgow.A shop in a central position of the city was rented for six months and  given  over, for  periods of  a fortnight each,  to individualEmpire countries.   The direct contacts thus formed with tradersand  with the general public proved  most effective  in opening up new and in broadening established lines of Empire trade.                           Colonies.   56. The Memorandum states that &quot; the development of  those  (Note byparts of the  Empire where the standard of living is very low  *he.  . . can, over a period  of time, play an important  part in the  statefortlsolution  of the unemployment problem.  This is especially true  Colonies.)of the Colonial  Empire where vast  areas endowed with almostlimitless natural resources are still largely  undeveloped and are under British  control.&quot;   With  this  view  there can be  littledisagreement provided that the light emphasis is attached  to thewords &quot; over a period of time.&quot;  It would be a mistake to suppose that the development of the Colonial Empire if it is to proceed on sound lines will have in  the  immediate future any  appreciableinfluence on the employment position in  this country.  The fruitsof the policy are  to be sought  rather  in the increase of  trade which Colonial prosperity  will ultimately bring.   57. The Colonial Empire,  using that term to cover colonies,,protectorates  and mandated  territories administered  by HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in the  United Kingdom, represents an immense area, the economic  requirements  and potentialities ofwhich are in the main  complementary to the potentialities and requirements  of the  United Kingdom.  This area is to a largeextent undeveloped.  Its further development will result  in theincreased production of food supplies  and of  raw materials suchas are essential for British  industries.  The increased income and prosperity  resulting from the sale of such food supplies and rawmaterials will result in an increased demand for and consumptionof the manufactured products  of which the United kingdom might be the principal source of supply.
   58. The  Government have shown  themselves fully alive tothe importance  of  this  aspect  of  Imperial policy.  Within amonth  of  assuming  office,  they  introduced  into parliament the Colonial Development  Bill, which  became   law at  theend of  July,  1929.  The Advisory  Committee  contemplate under  the Act  was  appointed  shortly  afterwards.  The  Actmakes provision for an  annual expenditure from  public fundswhether by way  of  grant or  loan of a  sum  not exceeding 1,000,000,  in aid of agriculture and  industry in  the Colonies.During  the  last fourteen months the  Committee has  examineda total of 186  schemes submitted from 31  different  ColonialAdministrations, and has reported favourably upon 136 of these.In no case has Government approval  been  refused to a recom-mendation made by the Committee.  These 136 schemes call fora  total  expenditure  of   8,715,180,  of which   3,476,010  isestimated to be spent  in  the   United  Kingdom.  The  totalassistance recommended from the  Colonial Development fund to date is  2,603,059, of which it was contemplated that  987,812would  be required in the current  financial year,  530,638 in1931-32,  and   453,402  in  1932-33.  There  is  ground  forsupposing that a small proportion of the expenditure envisagedfor the current year will in fact not be required until after April 1stnext, but it is reasonably probable  that the  1,000,000 provided under the Development Act will be fully utilised during this andsucceeding years.   59. So far   750,000  only has  been  voted  by Parliament,but the Chancellor of  the Exchequer, who is  responsible toParliament for  the fund, has undertaken to include if necessary a further  250,000 in the Supplementary Estimates.   60. I think it only  right to  call attention to the fact  that circumstances  may make it necessary for  the Government toconsider at  a later stage whether or not to ask  Parliament forincreased provision.  The question  is not immediately pressing,but at the recent Colonial Office Conference, at which much time was  given to  questions  affecting  economic  development,  therepresentatives of the several Colonial Administrations were urged to make full use of the generous facilities afforded  by the Statute,and it remains to be seen whether the response will  be such as torender inadequate the present statutory total.              Industrial Invention  and Research.   61. For  convenience of  discussion, Mr. Lloyd  George&apos;suggestions may be analysed as follows :         (a) The conditions in this country should be such as to    facilitate the pursuit of industrial research and the discovering    and wise application of invention.   Two ideas seem to be involved in the proposals :         (i) The  provision of adequate facilities  for groups  of            manufacturers and individual manufacturers to have            investigations made on problems concerning their            industries ;        (ii) The provision of facilities for helping private inventors            to  develop  ideas,  to  test them out in practice            and (?) to exploit promising inventions under proper            conditions.   To fulfil these objects it is recommended that the State shouldtake the initiative in founding  an Institution on the lines ofthe Mellon  Institute of  the  United  States  of  America.  (SeeAppendix I.)        (b) Better co-ordinating  of  the  work of various bodies    working under the Government or with Government assistance    is desirable, and enquiry should be made into  this.   62.  It is submitted  that the Research Association Scheme,which  was  formulated  by  the Department  of  Scientific  andIndustrial Research and has formed a major part of the Depart-menfs  activities since 1917, fulfils these requirements, at least asregards  the demands  of groups  of  manufacturers,  far moreadequately  than the Mellon  Institute.  The operations of the(Note bythe LordPresidentof theCouncil).
Mellon Institute have been  well known to the Department of scientific and Industrial Research  and its Advisory Council  forthe last  15 years.  The Mellon Institute was founded in March,1913, and the Department of Scientific  and Industrial Researchwas set up by Order in Council in July, 1915.   63. When the Advisory Council of the Department, comprisingeminent  scientists, experienced industrialists, and distinguishedadministrators,  addressed themselves to the  task of devising ascheme  to encourage the application  of science  to industrialoperations, they considered and rejected the idea of forming one central institution  to which  industries could turn for help and guidance in the matter.  They did so  for definite reasons.  an institution like the Mellon Institute doing exceUent work waswell suited, no  doubt, to American  industrial mentality ;  suchan  institution   is  equally or even  better  suited  to  Germanindustrial mentality.  It does not appeal to the British industrialmind.  The British industrialist is essentially an individual.  Hehas a rich pride in his work and that of his forbears ;  he  has a profound distrust of Government Departments ; he hates havingideas foisted upon him from outside, and he dislikes having toask for assistance.   64. The Advisory Council, therefore,  devised a  scheme which,in their opinion,  offered the best  chance  of getting  british manufacturers to use science to a greater extent in their operations.Historic  traditions and great  technical skill, as for instance in thecenturies-old  wool  industry;  ignorance  due to indifferenteducation, as for instance in the boot and shoe industry, operatedto make the inculcation of new scientific ideas difficult of acceptanceor of understanding.  In a relatively new industry, such  as  the electrical, whose every development is based on scientific discovery,the difficulty was not so great.   65. The scheme devised consisted  in the formation of research associations for the various industries of the country ; co-operativeorganisations which could cater for large and small firms  on an equitable basis  and conduct research work for the  benefit of allcontributing to their support.  To encourage the  formation ofthese industrial research associations,  Parliament voted the sum ofone million pounds in 1917-18 to be  spent over an agreed period to supplement  the funds supplied  by the  contributing  firms.That fund  is now on  the point of exhaustion,  and  since  the formulation  of  the scheme  27 research associations have beenfounded and 20 are in  full operation at the present time.   The  essential features of  these associations are the foUowing.Each is  an  organisation set up by  the industry for the industry.They  are autonomous  bodies, appointing their  own staffs and arranging  their own programmes  of  research,  with  intimate knowledge of the problems that confront the  industry concerned.The Department as  a  condition of  its  grant aid  has  to  satisfyitself that there is due prosecution  of  research and the  annualprogrammes and estimates come under the review of the AdvisoryCouncil  who can make suggestions, but who do not approve them as a condition of grant.  The greatest possible freedom is givento  the governing  bodies  of  research associations  to  work  out their  own   salvation.   The  Advisory  Council   felt  that  the considerations   alluded  to   above  made  it  imperative  thatgreat  freedom of action should be  given  to these  co-operativeresearch organisations if the results obtained were to be utilised.It is of little use to produce results if they are not applied, and ofstill less use to publish the results by  a State research organisation to  be used  possibly by  foreign competitors with their  liveliersense of potentialities.    66. Most of the research associations have now been in exist-ence for 10  years  and their early growth has been the  subjectof much anxiety on the part of the far seeing leaders of industryresponsible for their initiation and their development has involvedmuch sympathetic stimulation by the Advisory Council  of the
Department.   The whole venture was novel and it has no counter-part in any other country.   But the battle has been largely wonand the prospects of the research associations as a whole may besaid to be bright.  The reasons for optimism may be substantiatedby one  or  two facts, given as illustrations of the way in  whichthese organisations are helping the industries they represent.  OnOctober  16th &quot; The Times &quot;  reported that the Cotton ResearchAssociation has received 1,600 enquiries from 426 firms, 40 percent, from  spinners and 34 per cent, from manufacturers ; that6S2 visits have been paid by research officers of the association to mills of members to give advice and assistance ; while recently the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations has set upa Trade Development Sub-Committee  on which the Director ofthe Research  Association is a prominent member.  The workof this Trade Committee promises to bring into still closer contactthe scientific work of the Association with industrial operations.   67. Turning to the value  of the work done by the Associationsin bard cash, it may be stated at once that it is impossible as a ruleto compute in pounds, shillings and  pence the  value of their operations.  But it has been authoritatively stated that the valueof the  benefits  gained  from the operations of  the ElectricalResearch Association can be reasonably estimated  at a  figureapproaching  1,000,000 per annum  for an annual expenditure of 25,000 and a total cost of roughly  150,000.   6S. Enough, perhaps, has been  said to prove  the wisdom ofthe Advisory  Council some  13 years  ago in formulating their scheme  of  research associations.  The present members of that council  from  their  first-hand knowledge of the work of  the associations are convinced  of its soundness ;  the facts of theposition provide an answer to the suggestion that the Governmentshould  consider the  best means of bringing the work of  theDepartment and other organs of research in closer touch with thepractical needs of industry.   69. As  stated above the fund  of   1,000,000 established in1917-1S is on  the  point of  exhaustion.  Some two  years  ago,when the  future  policy governing  State  assistance to research associations was  reported on by the  Advisory  Council, it  was realised that the  residue of  the original Million Fund was quite inadequate to carry out the  policy  advocated.  Appreciatingthe national importance of these proposals as affecting the futureindustrial  development  of the country, the  Treasury agreed in1928 to consider when the time came, provision for further grantsup to a limit of  100,000 per annum.   Proposals based on the more accurate estimate of requirements which can now be made, have accordingly been  submitted through  the appropriate  channel.These proposals will, for the reasons already indicated, be  on thelines  of the  continuance and of  the  development  of research associations and other organisations designed to  assist industryin  the  most  practical  way.   Without adequate provision  fororganised research no constructive  policy for the reconditioningof industry and the advancement  of industrial efficiency couldbe complete.    70. The remarks in lines  10-12 of p. 30 of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;sMemorandum anent  the difficulties of  the private inventor aregenerally agreed  by the Department.  But on  the other hand the Department^ experience would indicate that (apart perhapsfrom the danger of improper financial exploitation) the importanceof this issue can be  easily exaggerated.  The day is almost gonewhen  the  private  investigator  without means, and withoutcontacts with competent scientific persons  who  can secure theinterest  of reputable industrialists  in a valuable invention, can produce, except on rare occasions, a real and important advance.The policy of the  Department in  relation  to the  assistance of
inventors is described in the following  extract from the Reportof its Advisory Council  for 1920-21.       A great number of the  applications we  have received    relate  to  inventions  which,  if  not fantastic, are at least    scientifically unsound.  This is  perhaps to be expected, for    we think it will only occasionally be the case that an inventor    who has a good idea, and the capacity to work it out, will    seek Government assistance.  He will, as a rule, prefer either    to rely upon his own resources, or to approach a firm known    to be interested in discoveries of the kind he has made, and    likely,  therefore, to give him immediate  remuneration.   We    have pointed  out  that the research  associations  which are    now established in some numbers  may  be more  successful    in encouraging inventors than  a Government Department.    We have every hope that this will be the case and, accordingly,    where  we  have received  an application  for assistance in    connexion  with an  invention which appears likely to be of    interest to some industry which has established a research    association, we have, as a rule, referred the applicant to that    body.       The cases of useful  discoveries which cannot be dealt    with either by an industrial research association  or in con-    nexion with research undertaken for the Government services,    and  which  therefore  will  still  fall to us for consideration,    will be  few in number, judging from past experience ;  but    we shall be ready,  as in the past, to consider applications    for assistance in research required to perfect for commercial    use a new scientific discovery or invention.   In dealing with    such applications we require, as a rule, that the invention    must first be patented or protected, and, before recommending    assistance  from public  funds, we expect the discoverer to    enter into an agreement  with  the Department  as to the    terms on which his  invention may be exploited.  71. The nine years which have elapsed since that was writtenconfirm  strongly  the  general conclusions  therein   expressed.Applications to the Department in connexion with  inventionsare  continually received,  but inventions   of  even  superficialpromise are conspicuously rare.   In  any case I would  strongly  oppose any suggestion for aState  organisation  to  examine,  test and report upon  privateinventions.  A Department of State would be obliged to consider and  deal more considerately than would a private organisation with a mass of applications  which were utterly worthless  andwould be under the continual necessity of meeting criticism ofrefusal to  undertake  tests.   Inventors are  notoriously andnaturally optimists, and they are perhaps distinguished amongst other men by  the zealousness of their attempts to secure theinfluence of important persons in pressing their claims.   72. I do not agree that there  is  need for further enquiry intothe co-ordination  of State controlled or supported organisations for conducting industrial research.   So far as organisations con-trolled by  the Government  are  concerned,  a  comprehensiveenquiry of this nature  was  completed less than two years agoby the Research Co-ordination Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Civil Research.  The recommendations of that Committee asregards industrial research have been implemented  and  there seems  no reason to reopen the question yet.  The multiplicity ofState research organisations and the complexity of their adminis-tration no doubt appeals to those unfamiliar  with details  of their work and functions to be unnecessary, but in view of  the resultsof the recent enquiry it must be assumed that there are soundreasons of policy behind the present system.   The wider questions of the co-ordination  of the work of state-controlled and  state-aided organisations for conducting industrial research, and  of the maintenance  of close contact between thework of  such  organisations and the practical needs of industry,fall  to the Department of  Scientific and  Industrial  Research,
almost  alone  amongst  Government  Departments, to  consider.No general question has in fact  more frequently or more contin-uousfy engaged the attention of the Department and its AdvisoryCouncil (which, be it noted, is composed of eminent scientists andindustrialists, a proportion of whom retire each year).  As regardsthe co-ordination  of the work of these bodies, the Departmentitself undertakes the task of maintaining contact between  them,in various ways.  It received the reports of all the bodies to whichit gives financial assistance, as well as others,  and  it arranges forthe inter-communication of knowledge of common interest.  It alsoencourages direct  contact between the individual organisationsih ever,&apos; way possible. The work of the Departments own organisa-tion   is  similarly  co-ordinated  amongst  themselves  and  withoutside organisations.   The  Department  has  representatives  onthe Councils of all Research Associations to which it gives grants,and  on its own Boards and Committees the Directors of research associations concerned with related problems frequently serve.   73.  Lastly,  in  view  of the opening remarks of the section ofMr.  Lloyd George&apos;s memorandum  the  following  extract fromthe draft report (approved  in principle, but subject to drafting amendments)  of  the  Advisory  Council for  the year ending31st July last  may be of interest.        The past year has been characterised in this country by     growing concern at the increasing tide of unemployment with     all its attendant evils, and  in common with others having  a     share in the responsibility for the well-being of the State, we     have had continually in our minds the need for assisting and     accelerating the recovery of British industry and trade from     its present depression.  It is not for us to attempt a diagnosis     of the origin of the present difficulties or to discuss the reme-     dies which may be required to deal with the causes underlying     them, but since we are charged with the duty of advising     on steps to be taken for the advancement of trade and industry     by means of  scientific  research,  it has been  our concern to     consider how  science can help in larger measure to restore our     industries to  full health.        Science can by itself offer no solution to this large problem,     which has many aspects and in which many influences, some     world-wide and some peculiar to this country, are at work.     But we are convinced that  no complete  solution is possible     which does not include acceptance of the help which  science     can give.   From our point  of view  the immediate question     is  how British manufacturers are  to be  enabled to combat     the intense competition with which they are now confronted     from almost  every quarter  of the globe.   This competition     is one mainly of price, and the obvious remedy is the produc-     tion of goods which appeal most to the prospective purchaser     at a price which, bearing quality in  mind, is most attractive     to him.   The full application of scientific knowledge and     scientific method to existing processes of manufacture and     the active  prosecution of research to discover new processes     are, we believe, essential if remunerative production is to be     realised.   At the  end of  the last century, and even later,     Great  Britain  held a pre-eminent position  amongst  the     industrial  nations  of  the  world.    This  position has been     partially lost, and while many factors have operated  in that     misfortune, we have no doubt that  amongst them has been     the  increased  use  of  scientific knowledge  and  scientific     method by our competitors abroad to overcome disabilities     arising  either  from  natural  disadvantages or  from  the     advantage which Great Britain held by its earlier start as an     industrial nation.  For example, one of the great advantages     enjoyed by us in the last century was the possession  of vast     resources of  power in  the  form of coal.  Though we still     possess  these resources, their competitive value  has been     largely  lost,  by  the  development abroad of  alternative     sources, e.g.,  water power and oil, as well as by the working     in other  countries of coal supplies as rich as our  own.  We     cannot expect to  recover the position we once held unless,
7.feet ii    where we possess natural advantages, we exploit them to the    full, and  where we have no advantage, we employ all the    agencies available for increasing our efficiency.  We are glad    to know that in many of our industries this is fully realised,    and that large  research laboratories and organisations are    maintained by many firms.  We would again urge as strongly    as we can that great as the temptation may  be, in times of    financial stringency, to reduce expenditure on what is not,    at first sight, an immediately productive branch of industrial    organisation, it is when times are bad that research is most    important.   It is now more than ever incumbent  upon us    to see that the resources of science are not neglected.                       Trade  Statistics.   74. On page 31 of the Liberal Memorandum, the statement is  (Note by-made (following a reference to  the position in the  United States)  ^ethat &quot; so  far as statistics are concerned, British Industry has to  the Board0work largely in the dark &quot; ; and the reference concludes  with the  Qf Trade.)suggestion that the Board of Trade should &quot; be prepared to collectand issue  fuller statistics, and to encourage industries to do this in fuller measure for themselves &quot;.   75. The Board of Trade fully agree as to the value of statistical information and as to the desirability of developing  on  well-considered lines the statistical material of interest to industry andtrade.   At the same time, however, the statement quoted above,as to British Industry working  largely in the dark, throws a quiteunmerited aspersion on the quantity and quality of the statisticalmaterial at  present placed at the disposal of industry and tradein this country  by  Government  Departments  and industrial organisations.   76. In considering the adequacy of the statistics compiled and published by the Board of Trade and other Government Depart-ments, a distinction may profitably be made between those whichare based on material necessarily coming  to  the knowledge ofGovernment officials in the ordinary  course of their  work,  andthose for  which  the data have  to be specially  obtained  frommanufacturers and traders.  So far as the former category isconcerned, it  will hardly be disputed that  the  statistics are, onthe whole,  adequate.  For example, the monthly and annualvolumes of  Trade and Shipping Statistics compare  favourably with the corresponding statistics issued by the principal foreigncountries  ; and our statistics of unemployment are of a complete-ness unparalleled elsewhere.  In this respect the highly developedstatistical system of the United States is seriously lacking, for noreliable figures of unemployment in that country are available.   77. In the case of those statistics for which material has to be specially obtained from the trade interests concerned, it is clearthat in the  absence of compulsory powers the activities of theGovernment Departments are limited by the willingness of trading interests to lend their co-operation.  As a conspicuous  example ofthe unwillingness of many manufacturers to furnish information,even in what may be regarded as  their own  interests, referencemay be made to the attempt  by  the  Board of Trade to coUectinformation as to the condition of industries  affected  by safe-guarding  duties.  Particulars were requested (generally throughthe Trade Associations concerned) as to output, numbers employed and, in some cases, prices ;  but  in no instance was it found possibleto obtain  complete particulars, and, in the  case of several of thetrades concerned, the particulars furnished were so  incompleteas to  be almost valueless.   Even where compulsory powers are available,  difficulties still remain.   For example, the Census of Production is  conductedunder compulsory powers, but great difficulty has been experiencedat each census in securing  the accurate completion and promptreturn of  the  census schedules  issued to manufacturing  firms.   78. While the need for, and value of, statistics arc graduallybecoming more generally recognised,  there are certain considera-tions which make individual manufacturers and traders reluctant
(Note bythePresidentof theBoard ofTrade.)to supply statistical material to Government Departments. Apartfrom  the general  objection  to  an  extension  of Governmentactivities, some fear that, in spite of all safeguards, the details oftheir business will become known to competitors, while  in somecases publication of figures about trade and industry encountersobjection on the ground that  valuable information will be givento trade rivals in other countries.  These considerations obviouslyaffect not only attempts by Government Departments to collectstatistics on a voluntary basis, but also any proposals for conferringcompulsory powers on Departments to obtain statistical data.   79. Even where compulsory powers are not available, however,the Board of Trade has succeeded in securing a certain measure ofco-operation leading  to the  publication  of valuable statistics.One example of this is the quarterly Index of  Industrial Produc-tion, which  is based mainly on information supplied  voluntarilyby Trade Associations or important individual firms,  and which,while no doubt susceptible of improvement, is representative ofmore  than  two-thirds  of the total manufacturing and  miningactivity of the United Kingdom, as ascertained in the 1924 census.A still more recent example of  statistics compiled through  theassistance of the  trading interests concerned is the Summary of retail Trade, compiled by the Bank of England from information furnished to them regarding the trade of departmental stores allover Great Britain  and published monthly  in the Board of TradeJournal.  No index of  retail trade  activity  has hitherto been available and while the figures at present  published reflect onlyone particular section  of such trade, their value has been widely recognised,  and they may form a basis on  which more extensivestatistics can be produced in future.   80. The  extent and  range  of  the statistics compiled  and published by or  through the agency of  Government  Depart-ments is  graphically  demonstrated by the  annual  &quot; Guide to current  Official Statistics,&quot; the latest volume of which contains316 octavo pages.   81. These official statistics are supplemented by a considerable,and probably increasing,  volume  of statistics  compiled byindustries on their own account.  Examples of these are the detailed figures relating to the Iron and Steel Industry which are published by the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers,  andthe full  statistics of  Shipbuilding  issued by Lloyds  Register ofShipping.  In the case of the  Electrical Manufacturing Industry,valuable  statistics and  trade  information are  compiled  and published by the  British Electrical  and  Allied ManufacturersAssociation. In the case of some other trades (e.g., Boot and ShoeManufacturing)  statistics are compiled for the  benefit of  themembers of the Trade Association  but  are  not  published forgeneral information.    82. It is of course true that the  extension of similar statisticalactivity to  other Industries  depends very considerably on the degree of organisation of the  industry concerned and the natureof the firms composing it.  All  advances  towards &quot; rationalisation-tion,&quot; however,  will  tend not  only to make the collection ofindustrial statistics more practicable but also to create a demandfor such information ; and a gradual development may, therefore,be  anticipated  in the  extent and  adequacy  of the  statisticscompiled by industries on their own account.    83. The Board of Trade have consistently encouraged industryand trade to compile and issue full statistics and they will continue their efforts in this direction.                        Standardisation.    84.  The Memorandum rightly  points  out that the  problem of  standardisation and simplification is  a much more  difficult one in this  country than in the United States of America. United Kingdom manufacturers have to supply, firstly, an open domestic market  in  which  foreign competitors are eager to strengthen their footing by  meeting the varying tastes of consumers, and
 secondly, a great variety of overseas markets where the idiosyn- crasies of the consumers have  to be  carefully studied.   The manufacturer for export is often put in the dilemma that  long runs of standardised goods  would materially help to lower his. cost of production and price, and that  on the other  hand he is being constantly criticised for not being ready to meet the tastes of the buyers in the oversea markets.  But, subject to this, there is undoubtedly room, as the Memorandum points  out, for much more  standardisation and simplification.    85. The Memorandum refers  only to the work  of  the British Engineering Standards  Association in respect of standardisation &quot; in its own field.&quot;   It does not refer to certain recent develop- ments in respect of that Association nor to the action which has been taken by the  Government, partly in connection with the Association and partly&quot; distinct from it.    86. The desirability of the greater development of standardisation- tion  and simplification in this  country has  been a matter of immediate  concern to  the Board of Trade  in recent years.  It was on the initiative of the Board  that the question was raised at the Imperial Conference of 1926, when a resolution was passed in the following terms :         &quot;The  Imperial  Conference recognising the  advantages     of standardisation  in, its widest sense, both to  producers and     to consumers, and  appreciating that when it is  practicable     to adopt standards common to the  Empire these  advantages     are augmented and great benefit results to  trade within the     Empire and  Empire trade generally,  recommends to the     favourable consideration of  the several Governments of the     Empire that  they  should take steps to promote  the further     development of standardisation,  should arrange for  the     exchange of information with the other parts of  the Empire,     and, when common  standards are possible  and mutually     advantageous, should co-operate with the other parts of the     Empire in regard thereto.&quot;    87. In  1927  the Chairman  of  the Australian  Council for Scientific and Industrial Research  and of the Commonwealth Engineering Standards Association visited this  country, and an informal conference was arranged between him and representatives of United Kingdom industrial and trade organisations and of the British  Engineering  Standards Association.   Following on  this the Central Committee for  Standardisation and  Simplification, set up by the Board of Trade (see below), reported that it would be advantageous  to hold an official conference between repre- sentatives  of  the standardisation  organisations in  the United Kingdom and the  Dominions,  at  which the  question  of co- ordination  and co-operation between the various parts of the Empire in  respect  of  standardisation  and simplification  could be  fully discussed.  A  proposal  to this  effect was made  to His  Majesty&apos;s Governments  in  the  Dominions  and  to  the Government  of   India  and  was  unanimously  accepted.   It is  now  taking  place.   Standardising  bodies  of one kind or another  already  exist  in Canada,  Australia,  the  Union  of South Africa and India, and there is a good deal of co-operation between them and the British Engineering Standards Association; active steps are  being taken to set up a similar body in  New Zealand, and it is hoped that a  result of the Conference will be the establishment of a system of much closer and more  rapid co-operation between all these bodies.    88. With  regard  to  the  British  Engineering   Standards Association itself, much valuable work has been done by that body  and a considerable amount has  been  done in particular industries by other bodies, such as the Society of Motor Manu- facturers and  Traders;   the  Cable  Makers&apos; Association;  the British Electrical and  Allied Manufacturers&apos; Association all of which are closely associated with the British Engineering Standards Association ;  the Federation of Master  Printers of Great Britain and Ireland ;  and a number of bodies connected with the chemical industries.  The  activities of the British Engineering Standards
          Association  already extend  beyond  tbe engineering  field, and          discussions are now proceeding which may result in giving the          Association  a much more comprehensive scope.   This will be          marked by  dropping the term  &quot; Engineering &quot; from its  title, a          course on which the Council of the Association has already agreed.          The Board  of Trade and other Government  Departments are          represented upon the Council of  the Association  and there is          close co-operation between it and the Government purchasing          Departments.              89. The substantial  financial  assistance which  was  at  one          time given to the Association by the Government  had  been          reduced for a number of years to  a merely nominal contribution          (apart from payments made by certain Government Departments          for  specific services) :  but  it  was  recently  decided  that the          Government would  make a  contribution to  the  funds  of the          Association for  a period  of  five   years,  commencing  with the          present financial  year, of a minimum of  3,000 a year, rising to          a maximum of  5,000, according as contributions to theAssociation          from industrial sources increase above their present level.              90.  In  respect  of  Government requirements,  it should  be          stated that since  1924 there has been in existence an Interdepart-          mental Committee on General Stores whose purpose it is to bring          about co-operation  in  respect of the Government purchasing          specifications for general stores.              The  British  Engineering  Standards Association   is  repre-          sented on the main committee and there is provision for  similar-          representation on the  sub-committees,  and there  is also  close          contact between  the committees  and the Federation  of  British          Industries.   There  are also  Government committees  dealing          with building materials,  textiles and  clothing,  and  electrical          apparatus and material, and there are in connection with  these          similar arrangements  for  the representation  of the  British          Engineering Standards  Association and the Federation  of British          Industries.              91.  In   1928  the  Central Committee  (already mentioned)          was  formed for  the purpose of  encouraging the  development          of  standardisation  and  simplification.  This body,  which  is          presided over by the Parliamentary Secretary to  the Board  of          Trade,  includes  representatives  of  Government purchasing          Departments, of the British Engineering Standards Association,          and a number of the chief industrial and commercial Associations          of  the country.  The  Committee  has paid particular attention          to  simplification  and has endeavoured to explore its possibilities          with representatives of a number of industries in relation  to their          particular products.  A good&quot; deal in the way of simplification          has been done by various industries, but the  work of the  Com-          mittee has shown  very clearly not  only the  advantages which          may result  from the  judicious application of the principle  of          simplification, but also the difficulties which  arise and to which          attention has been drawn at the commencement  of  this  note.          The essential preliminary to standardisation  of any product is          the development of an initiative in favour of it within  the trades          concerned,  and it is to this problem that the Central Committee          has largely directed its attention.   As a step towards the develop-          ment of this initiative, the Board of Trade, on the recommendation           of the Central Committee, have recently decided  to compile  an           index of industrial specifications,  that is to say, not only specifically -           cations issued by standardisation bodies or by organised  trade           associations, but also commodity specifications used by  Govern-           ment  Departments,  Municipal  authorities,  and other  large           purchasers.   This  index will, it  is  hoped, show  the  particular           articles in  the case of which the interests concerned might find           it  advantageous to  investigate the possibility and desirability           of greater uniformity and furnish material on the  basis of  which           such investigations could be undertaken.(Note by                          Other State Action.the            92.

   93. As regards the Export side  of  the  trade of  the country it  may be said that the Overseas Trade  Development council was  brought  into  being precisely  for  the purpose  suggested.The  Council was created at the beginning of April  of this year,and  its origin  is to be  found in  the fact  that the Minister  incharge of the Department of Overseas Trade considered that the usefulness  of  the department would  be  strengthened by thecreation  of an  organisation who would examine the problems  of export trade, study  present  and potential markets, investigatereasons for the decline  in exports by trades  and markets, and as certain  possible remedies  with  the  object  of the  profitableexpansion of British trade.   94. To carry out this work it  was necessary to receive theassistance and  co-operation   of industry.   A Standing council was  formed, presided over by the Minister.   In  order  that theCouncil&apos;s work should be as specific as possible, when particulartrades or markets are being  reviewed,  special  representatives  oftrade and  industry  are  invited to attend  the meetings  of theCouncil.   It was for this reason that  a panel  of representativeswas  formed who are  also available for informal consultations.   In its comparatively short life the Council has taken action  indirections which it is hoped  will have  beneficial results  to theexport trade  of the country.  The key-note of the Councd&apos;policy is to encourage specific industries to take action on  behalfof the industry as a whole : in other words, even if the State doesgive some measure of assistance that industry should help itself.   In  conformity with  that  policy, after discussing  with lord&apos;Abernon and members of his Mission the most likely lines  ofdevelopment in South America, the Council met various  trades and discussed with them steps that might reasonably be expectedto increase export trade.   Discussions are taking place with the agricultural machinery and  the  electrical industries  which it  is hoped will lead to anattack on the South American markets.   Particular reference may  be made to the visit of the MasterCutler of Sheffield  to South  America.   This visit was arranged as a result of representations made by the Development council as to the steps which should  be taken to capture  further trade trade badly needed by Sheffield in the South American markets.The  Master Cutler is at present in South America undertaking an investigation of market  conditions and  trade  possibilities  in theprincipal markets of that  continent.   Sheffield has contributedthe major proportion of the expenses  involved, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  expressing  their willingness to contribute towardsthe cost to a maximum of  750.   Trade investigations in overseas markets by experts appointedby specific trades receive every encouragement from the Council.   The Development Council feel that, as a  first  step towardscloser co-operation at home, it is desirable for the units in a tradeto get together in  studying an  overseas  market  and therebyrealise the measures that are necessary to enable British industryto compete successfully with foreign  competition.  It is nowpossible  to  announce though not for publication that theFederated  Associations  of Boot  and Shoe Manufacturers, after discussion  with the  Council, have  agreed  to undertake  an investigation in Norway,  Sweden, Denmark,  Finland and theNetherlands.   Similar discussions have  been arranged with  the  national association of Scottish Woollen Manufacturers,  (the  U.S.A.market)  and the Scottish Hosiery and  Knitwear ManufacturersAssociation.   95. Missions. Another field where it is considered that practi-cal help may be given to export trade is by the sending of powerfuleconomic missions from this country  to  visit  other selectedcountries.  At present there is such a mission in South Africa and
another very important economic mission is on its way to japan and China.  In addition to the economic mission proper, there is a specially appointed Cotton Sub-Mission which was organised afterthe Development Council  had discussed  the  matter with theJoint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations.  It is significant that the cotton industry, through the cotton trade fund, agreed tomake a grant of  6,000 towards the cost of the Mission.   96. In another direction  encouragement of co-ordination  of effort in  industry has been successful.   The Government, having decided to expend a sum of  30,000 on official participation in the British Empire Trade Exhibition to beheld in Buenos  Aires next year, are giving the  Exhibition thefullest possible assistance with a  view to securing that Britishindustry as a whole is adequately represented, and efforts havebeen made to secure collective exhibits.  For instance, a proportionof the sum of  30,000 has been earmarked to meet the cost of thedespatch to Buenos Aires during the Exhibition of the  aircraft carrier H.M.S. &quot;Eagle,&quot; carrying a full complement of  aircraft(including many of the latest types of machines).  The GovernmentPavilion  will include,  in addition  to  an official AeronauticalExhibit,  a series  of exhibits  presented by some of  the  leadingBritish aircraft firms, who have been permitted to take space inthat building.   Thus  encouraged,  the British aircraft industry as a whole hasdecided to expend a  sum of  25,000 to meet the cost of flyingdemonstrations  in Buenos Aires throughout the period of the exhibition the first of their kind to be organised by this country.   Participation by the Government in  the Exhibition has led tothe co-ordinated efforts of  the British aircraft industry on anunprecedently large scale.  In addition to the participation of theBritish electrical industry (referred to elsewhere in this Memoran-dum) there will be composite exhibits  by the  Society of MotorManufacturers and Traders,  the British Cycle  and Motor  CycleManufacturers and Traders Union, the  Goldsmiths&apos;  and Silver-smiths&apos; Company, the Birmingham  Jewellers&apos;  and  the Silver-smiths&apos; Association.
PART III.Agriculture.   The most prominent feature of the Liberal proposals is land  (Note bysettlement,  with the establishment of  &quot; family  farms &quot;  on a  tbe Ministervery large scale as the essential part of the scheme.  Observations   ur^&apos;fricul&quot;on this proposal are  submitted as  Section  2 of this statement,which  is preceded (in Section I) by general comments on  theLiberal survey of the economic position of agriculture and on the suggested reconditioning of land. Subsequent sections deal withthe remaining  proposals  made  in  the   Liberal  Memorandum,in so far as they concern agriculture.                SECTION 1.-INTRODUCTION.   1. The  proposals set forth in the Liberal  Memorandum, sofar as they relate to agricultural land, are founded on the argument that agriculture is languishing on account of high costs, coupled with the impoverishment of landlords and tenants and consequentdecay of equipment and deterioration of  the soil.   It is suggestedthat &quot; the  reconstruction of agriculture . . .  offers a remedy forthe unemployment problem which is unique.&quot;  It is further argued that as this reconstruction is in the nature  of the case beyondthe capacity of landowners in general, it must be undertaken by,and at the  expense of, the State, the reconditioning and re-equip-ment of the land being treated as capital outlay, with a view tothe land being let for family or other farming to tenants, who willconform to modern methods of production and marketing.   2. The  Liberal Memorandum takes far too  gloomy a view ofthe condition of agriculture  in this  country as  compared withother countries.  It underrates  its efficiency and  overrates the degree to which it has declined.  A large part  of the subsequentproposals  put  forward for agriculture  are  built  up upon theassumption that it is relatively inefficient in comparison withother countries.  This point  of view appears in  many places inthe Memorandum.  For example, it is stated  that agriculture has reached &quot; a condition of crisis.&quot;  Again,  &quot; it  has been allowed tobecome so  run down  that it  is idle to imagine that it could be restored to prosperity, still less to the position it should occupyin the national economy, without the investment in it of verylarge  amounts of capital.&quot;  &quot; During the last decade or so over alarge part of England  and Wales the general condition, both of theland and its equipment,  has deplorably declined.&quot;  &quot; Much of ithas been persistently under-cultivated.   These  conditions nowalmost come to be regarded as normal, so that  even when the marketing  and labour cost difficulties of farming to which we have referred are removed, the land will have  to be  reconditionedbefore it can recover its normal productivity.&quot;   3. Again, the Memorandum suggests  in more  than one placethat the decline of British agriculture  is due  to the increasing efficiency   of agricultural  technique in  foreign  countries andinefficiency at home.   For example, &quot; the third cause of the declinein agriculture has been the inelastic and  out of date nature of its organisation.&quot;   &quot; The fundamental cause of  the  difficulties ofBritish agriculture has been the bringing into production of landsof the New World, and the introduction of new and more efficientmethods of farming and transportation in  other parts of theworld.&quot;   4. It is therefore worthy  of remark that  during recent yearswhen British agriculture has  been suffering  from falling prices,
 those overseas countries whose increasing technical  efficiency is.alleged as the cause of our trouble, have suffered equally with, if not more severely than, Great Britain.    5. The Memorandum  states in several places that what is necessary  for  British  agriculture is a  continuous change  and bringing up to date of its technique.   For example :  &quot; The only way in which  a  nation can maintain and increase its prosperity and  keep all its  citizens employed is that it should continuously improve  the  technique  and  organisation  of  its  established industries,  so  that they  are giving ever  better  value to the public.&quot;  Again, &quot; It is obvious that British agriculture can only keep its place if it also continuously  adapts itself  to  the ever changing inventions and market conditions of the modern world.&quot;    6. This implied criticism  is not borne out by the facts, for it  is only by  continuous adjustments  and changes  in farming practice that British agriculture, in a time of  exceptional economic difficulty,  has achieved the  remarkable result,  noted in  the Memorandum, of  increasing  the  total  volume  of  agricultural production since 1908.  Between 1908  and  1929  there has been a decline of about 2 J million acres in the area under crops and grass, so that  over this period British agriculture has contrived, by improving its  technique,  materially to raise the volume of output per acre.    7. This is  not  to say that its technique cannot and should not  be further improved,  or that it has progressed sufficiently fast  in recent years, but a fair and just judgment on this question is  essential  to a proper  appreciation of the present situation. That equipment has depreciated and  land has been allowed to deteriorate in the difficult economic circumstances  of  the past few  years cannot, unfortunately, be  denied, but the  facts do not justify the  extreme views which characterise so much of the Memorandum.    S.-After calling attention to the need for continuous improve- ment in technical methods and  the necessity for re-equipment, and after attributing our trouble partly to the lowering of cost of production in  competing countries, the Memorandum proceeds to its main  technical remedy,   which is the creation on a  very extensive scale of family  farms.   This is the fundamental recommendation of the Memorandum..  These family farms are to average 30 acres in extent, and it is  contemplated that  hired labour would  not be employed.    9. Such  family  farms,  although  presenting many attractions and affording many  advantages  from the social aspect are,  if regarded  solely  from  the economic point of view, technically inefficient, except  in  the  case of specialised  and limited lines of production, on carefully selected land.   This technical inefficiency may be overcome partly or  wholly  by the small  holder and his family working  longer, or for a lower economic reward than they would on a larger  holding, thereby enabling them to withstand (as they have done) the test of low prices better than the larger farmer employing hired labour at a price fixed by  Statute, but there can be  no doubt that from an economic  viewpoint such holdings are,  on  technical grounds, relatively inefficient.  The Memorandum says &quot; The evidence seems to be overwhelming that where the occupier is  a man or woman of reasonable energy and managing capacity it is as easy to make a good living on a small holding as on any other type&apos; of farm.&quot;  On the contrary, the weight  of the  evidence  based  on  systematic and continuous economic research and applied generally, is conclusive that, as the average  size of  holdings is diminished below a certain number of acres, it becomes progressively more difficult for the holders to make a  good living.   Although  the  productivity per acre increases as the size of holdings diminishes, the productivity per man decreases. Furthermore, research has shown not only that profits per acre
earned by the holder decrease generally as the size of the holdingis diminished from, say 200 acres, but the cost of labour per acreincreases ;  efficiency  of  horse  labour on the farm diminishes ;the efficiency of machinery  diminishes ; and the efficiency ofcapital  for  buildings  diminishes.  If, therefore,  the  lowering of the costs of  production in agriculture is the general objectiveto which agricultural policy should be aimed, as the Memorandumrightly  suggests, the  sub-division  of larger farms and  theirconversion into 100,000 family farms as  proposed in  the LiberalMemorandum would contribute nothing towards this objective.    10. It is  stated in the Memorandum that &quot; where capacity(of the individual) is  above the  average, small  holdings  have produced small fortunes or opened the way to larger scale farming.&quot;The family farmer, it is true, maintains his position, but frequentlyas  the  result  of uneconomic  expenditure  of labour,  both  by himself and by his wife and children.  Sir Daniel  Hall and other authorities have pointed  out that the encouragement of smallholdings or family farms is a social, not an  agricultural, policy.The aim of an  agricultural policy would  presumably be to makeagriculture more efficient, which really involves a reduction in theamount of human effort required per unit  of food produced.  Apolicy aiming at the creation of a large number of family farms doesnot, in fact, tend to development on these lines.  The experienceof Denmark is often used in support of a small holdings policy inthis country, but the comparison is at best superficial.  Mr. C. S.Orwin, in his recent book, &quot;The Future of Farming,&quot; says that&quot; to suggest that Denmark&apos;s achievement may serve as  a modelfor the future development of English farming is to wonder whythe efficiency of the camel trains of the desert has  never been realised by the directors of English railways.&quot;    11. There is ample room in this  country for  holdings of allsizes,  but it is obvious if the  industry&apos; is to attract and retain themost  enterprising business-men, there must be some developmentof the large scale farm, with its possibilities of more economic useof man power.   To  contemplate such a great extension of  that part  of  the  agricultural community which  consists of peasantfarmers  emplo5&apos;ing no labour  other than  that  provided by  the family, is to anticipate a substantial lowering in the  standard of life, often below that of the hired labourer, as has been shown tobe the case in other countries.    12. It has  been  rightly  observed  that the  savings  of  wagecosts  on a family farm should not obscure the fact  that duringlean years the  net income derived from it is  less,  in many cases,than  the combined earnings of the tenant and his family reckonedat the minimum wage rates.  The assurance of employment and subsistence is a substantial set-off ;  moreover, there are, withouta doubt, a number of persons who definitely  prefer the amenities and attractions of the lite of the small-holder, with all its anxietiesand its long hours, to the less responsible work and limited hoursof the wage earner.  It is an  open question, however, whether theintroduction within such a limited time of 100,000 families to theconditions of the small-holder&apos;s life would be attended by happyresults, or be regarded  by them after the novelty of the changehad worn off, as an improvement in their lot.  This would applymore especially to the urban  trainees,  from whose ranks  it is recognised that the great  majority of  the  100,000  familieswould of necessity have to be recruited.    13. The social  aspect  of the small holding  is  an entirely different matter.  There will, it is hoped, always be a number ofwould-be small-holders prepared  to settle on  tire land in thiscountry.  The  State has recognised its  duty to encourage themand to provide facilities for them, thereby settling more peopleon the land and establishing the necessary social ladder for theagricultural worker and affording facilities for subsequent develop-ment into bigger agricultural business.  This forms  part  of thepolicy of the present Government and the Liberal Memorandum
1        SECTION 2. THE FAMILY FARM SCHEME.   15. The  Liberal  programme is set  forth  succinctly in theMemorandum, and may. be summarised as follows :        (i) The State is to acquire :           (a) land for the purpose of providing family farms ;          (b) any land that needs  draining, soil improvement or      reclamation in order to enable it to produce efficiently ;          (c) any land suitable for afforestation ;          (d) any  land  where  the tenant  or  owner-occupier      wishes to  modernise the  equipment on approved lines      and has not the necessary capital.       The land is to be acquired either in lieu of death  duties,     or in consideration of an annuity equal to  the net rent, or by     purchase in the  open market.        (ii) The State having acquired the land is to assume &quot; the     responsibility for  reconditioning and  equipping it with     buildings suitable to enable the occupier to produce efficiently     for the domestic market.&quot;        (hi) Supplementary to the above,  the State is to be     empowered to make capital advances for approved schemes     through  agricultural   credit  organisations  to   landlords,     tenants or owner-occupiers who wish to  modernise their     equipment, or to equip for, the purpose of new methods of     farming.is  right in advocating some  extension of that policy from thesocial point of view.  But the crucial point in regard to the policyof small holdings as a means of increasing employment dependsin the first instance on a careful selection of the areas where landis  capable of intensive  production.  It is only on such land orupon sub-marginal land that the  possibility of increasing agri-cultural employment is at all substantial.  In the latter case,although there  may be  many exceptions, the land has generallybecome sub-marginal because it is intrinsically  inferior and evenif  restored to its original condition would in those circumstances be hardly likely to be capable of supporting small-holders.  Thereare other areas which have never  been brought into  productionand which are capable of improvement, but  as a whole theseafford but little scope  for the average family  farmer or small-holder.    14. The re-conditioning of land not required for family farmsand the proposal to lend money to private landlords and tenantsfor this purpose may be taken to  be subsidiary and to be putforward as an illustration of  the extent  to which, in the opinionof the compilers of the  Memorandum, men  and money could be usefully employed  on work of this kind with  advantage to theagricultural industry.   Apart from drainage,  the  scope  of theproposals is not  defined and the  numbers  to  be employed arenot stated.  In regard thereto it should  be observed that, whileneglect of farm  equipment  and deterioration  of the land hascertainly  resulted  from the  economic conditions which  govern the industry and the impoverishment of land owners and tenants,it should not be assumed that expenditure  on  re-equipment andre-conditioning would necessarily be justified so long  as the rootcauses of depression remain.   Only in so far as  improvement andre-equipment would yield a  direct return commensurate with itscost would outlay be justified from the point of  view of individualowners.  For such cases credit facilities are already available.Indirect benefits  which may accrue to the  community from increased agricultural production or the provision of employmentin  consequence of such expenditure, although  not  capable  ofprecise measurement, are factors which cannot be ignored.
9 rj OFJ I 0    16. As a preliminary step an expert survey is to be made todetermine the amount and situation of agricultural land that needsreconditioning,  and an estimate of the cost.    17. It is  contemplated (i) that  100,000 family farms, i.e.,self-supporting  farms where hired labour is not necessary, ranging from three acres to 100 acres in extent, should be provided by theState as a first instalment,  possibly within three  to five years,directly increasing the net population on the land  by 200,000 to300,000;  (ii) that  as  the result of  the work  of  years, 500,000additional  workers (presumably including  the 100,000  familyfarmers mentioned above) would find employment in agricultureand its ancillary occupations, involving an increase in the ruralpopulation of 2,000,000 persons ;  and (iii) work would be providedduring the progress of the scheme for 150,000 workers per annum in putting up houses  and buildings (40,000 to 50,000), drainingand reconditioning land (100,000) ;  while another 20,000 would beundergoing training preparatory to  settlement  or subsequentlyfor entry into rural occupations.  From the figures given in theLiberal Memorandum, it  appears  to  be contemplated that the150,000  employed  would include those in  training  as  familyfarmers :  but 20,000 trainees are presumably again included asthose established, or to be established, on family farms.   18. When contemplating the extent to which the land offersa remedy for unemployment, it is of some importance to remember   (a) depression in agriculture has at least contributed tothe fall in the last nine years of 140,000 in the number of allclasses of workers engaged in the industry in Great Britain,that  the fall in those numbers last year was  32,000, and thatit is still continuing ;        (b) The area under cultivation has  declined each  year    since 1920, and is still declining, and the  number of livestock    on  farms is also declining with the exception of sheep, which    increased last year by nearly 300,000 after declining during    the two preceding years by nearly 1,000,000.        (c) While neglect of equipment  has certainly resulted    from this depression, its cause is very largely due to the fact    that  in many cases prices  realizable by producers are not    commensurate with the cost of production.   Only in so far    as improved equipment would be reflected in a reduction in    costs of production would this root cause be affected.        (d) The sub-division of farms is not in itself likely to reduce    costs of production.   19. The  Memorandum  recommends  that an  expert  surveyshould be made by the Minister of Agriculture to determine theamount and situation of agricultural land which needs recondition-ing, and an estimate of the cost of putting it into good condition,and of  the  amount of  employment which  could be  given  inthe immediate future in the process.   This proposal is part of thepolicy set out in Section VIII of the Memorandum.  The plan forcarrying out  a  survey does not seem to call for  any  specialcomment, except that such a survey must necessarily take time.Even if the necessary staff has been recruited, qualified to criticisefarming  operations, conversant with agricultural development and competent to form a definite opinion upon the best  way of sub-dividing or re-equipping or re-conditioning farms,  it is hardlylikely that on an average much more than, say, one farm where such reconditioning is necessary could be surveyed, considered and reported upon by such an expert  working  to defined standards in less than one day, and these reports would all require considera-tion and action afterwards.  If the policy of acquiring land whichneeds draining, soil improvement, land equipment or reclamationwere adopted, some such survey would, however, undoubtedly benecessary. It is stated in the Memorandum that there  are 476,000that
acres of waterlogged land ready for drainage immediately, without waiting for arterial drainage.  This is obviously  a reference tothe statement on page 22 of the Report of the Royal Commissionon Land Drainage (Cmd. 2993), but it is quite inaccurate to assume that schemes for arterial drainage would not first be necessary inrespect of large parts of this area.   20. When considering the proposal to establish  100,000 familyfarms, it  seems  desirable, at the outset,  to  review briefly thehistory of  small  holdings  legislation  and  administration  inEngland and Wales since 1908, when the first Act dealing effect-ively with the subject came into operation.   21. It  is necessary, however, to appreciate and to bear inmind  the  difference between a &quot; family farm &quot;  and  a  smallholding.  The statutory definition of a small holding is a holdingexceeding 1  acre, and either not exceeding 50 acres, or if exceeding50 acres,  then not exceeding an annual value for purposes of income tax of  100.  A small holding may or may not be self-supporting and may or may not afford facihties for the employmentof hired labour.   A family farm is to average  30 acres  in extent,be self-supporting and would not afford facilities for the employ-ment of hired labour.   22. During the 22 years that have elapsed, since the passingof the first  Small Holdings Act, there have been three stages in small Holding administration, marked, it is true, by a difference in method and circumstances, but, on the whole, governed by thesame guiding  principle.   Throughout, the  actual administration has up till now been in the hands of County Councils, except thatthe Ministry exercised power  under the Small Holdings ColoniesActs, 1916-1918,  to provide a limited number of farm settlements.   23. The  small Holdings and Allotments Act,  1908, was passed in order to satisfy the &quot; land hunger &quot; which  was believed to exist and to provide easier access to the land for those possessingthe necessary skill and capital.  In other words, it was intendedto provide a ladder by means of which agricultural workers whohad saved money could attain a position of independence for whichthe  opportunity was  otherwise  practically  non-existent.   TheAct presumed the  existence of a widespread demand for smallholdings by such persons and this assumption proved to be well founded.  Between  1908 and the  outbreak  of the War, some14,000 small holdings covering an area of  195,000 acres  were provided, with practically no resultant loss and very few failures.The holdings ranged from one acre to 50 acres  with an averageof 14 acres, and 70 per cent, of them were bare  land  holdings,that is without equipment of any kind.*   24. Tue  Land Settlement (Facilities) Act,  1919, was passed inorder to implement promises made to ex-Service  men.  Underthis Act some  16,000 holdings were created on an area of 256,000acres.  The average area was 16 acres and 54  per cent, of theholdings were bare land holdings.  Owing to high prices and high rates  of interest, the provision of these  holdings entailed heavy losses, which were, and still  are, borne entirely  by the State.The test of  means and experience was to some extent relaxed tomeet  post-War conditions, and as a result there was a proportionof failures,  though  probably not more than 15  per cent.  Asprinkling of trainees mostly disabled men were provided withholdings but the great majority of those selected for holdings hadprevious experience and some capital which could be supplementedin approved cases by loans on a 50/50 basis.  The Land SettlementScheme was definitely brought to an end in 1926, but was practi-cally  closed down some years earlier as a result  of the Geddeseconomies.   * Note. The reference in the Memorandum  to the establishment of nearly 15,000 family farms under the Act of 1908 is erroneous.   Even ifeveryone of the equipped holdings were self supporting, the total numberwould only amount to about 4,000.
   25. The Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1926, was passed in order to enable the provision of small holdings on more normallines to be resumed, but &quot;with this difference as compared with thepre-war holdings-namely, that in practically every instance andmore especially in the case of equipped holdings an annual lossis now incurred of  which the State bears 75 per cent, and theCounty Council  providing the holdings, 25  per cent.   This lossis due to the increased cost of new work and maintenance underpost-war conditions coupled with the higher rate of interest onloans (5 per cent, as compared with  3- - per cent, before the  war).These factors increase the annual outgoings incurred in relationto the holdings to an extent which  is not reflected in the &quot; Fullfair rent &quot; charged to the tenants.  Under the 1926 Act, provision has been made for the acquisition of approximately 17,000 acresdivided into 600 holdings with an average area of nearly 29 acres.The  aggregate annual loss deficiency i.e., the amount by whichloan charges exceed full fair rent is about 18,000.  The proportionof bare land holdings is about 36 per cent., which is considerably less than  the proportion  under previous  schemes.  The rate ofinterest on loans advanced by the  Public Works Loan Commis-sioners for small holdings has quite recently been reduced  from5 per cent, to 4  per cent., but this reduction is too slight to have any appreciable  effect.   26. Throughout the past 22  years  the  object has been  toprovide small holdings in response to an expressed demand  from,in the main, persons qualified by previous experience on the land and  possessing  the necessary means  to ensure  a reasonablelikelihood of success.   They are not necessarily self-supportingand a large  number of them  are in fact part-time holdings.  Onthe other hand, many small holders  employ hired workers. Therehas never been any suggestion that self-supporting small holdingsshould be provided because they are the ideal type of holding,viewed from a purely economic standpoint,  or that small holdersshould employ no hired labour.  It is possible, though incapable of proof, that the capital  outlay incurred in providing the 30,000or so holdings created under Statute since 1908, and the working capital and  labour utilised in  cultivating them, could have been applied by different methods, to a larger area of land, and secured a larger gross or net return. But the promotion of small holdingshas never proceeded by reference to any such consideration.  Ithas rested on the axioms (i)  that  it is desirable on grounds of social and national well-being that there should be a larger numberof persons settled on the land ; and (ii)  that so long as there is a genuine demand for either part-time or  whole-time small holdingsby persons who are likely to succeed, such holdings should be pro-vided if only as a stepping stone whereby those who are successfulmay  rise to larger holdings as their experience and their capitalincrease.   27. In this connexion importance attaches to the fact recorded in the Liberal Memorandum  &quot; that the  successful small holdertends to increase his holding until it passes out of the category.&quot;   28. If the provision of  small holdings in  the past has not been based on any assumption that they are economically the idealunit of cultivation, still less  has it been founded on any theorythat  small  holdings  afforded a  ready means of  livelihood  forredundant workers in industry.  The  problem has up till nowalways been looked at objectively,  as one of satisfying a concretedemand for small holdings of varying  types by persons likely to succeed in cultivating them.   29. By  the  observance of this practical  principle and  byexercising great care both in the choice  of suitable land and in the selection  of  qualified applicants, small holdings  provided underthe Small Holdings Acts have been, in the main, a marked success,for,  as has already been pointed out, small  holders have, in fact,generally faced up to and withstood the test of low prices better
than larger farmers, and the provision of these, small holdings hasbeen accompanied by a substantial increase in the resident popula-tion on the land.  It is  the intention of the present Government,not only to continue the same policy, but to carry it a stage further,and in the light of past experience to open up  a further field forexperiment, by carefully selecting unemployed industrial workerswith previous experience of the land and providing them with thenecessary working  capital as  well as  with  the land.  This is admittedly a new venture, but the administration of such a scheme must be governed by the same practical considerations, particularly as to choice of land and selection of settler,  as in the past, ifconsequences are to be avoided which would  be disastrous to thesettlers and  to the whole scheme.   30. What bearing have these observations  on the proposalswhich are being examined ?  In the first place, the figures given above  show  that during 16 effective  years of administration(i,e., excluding  the War years and the years  1924-25), the resultof the efforts of all the County Councils and Councils of county boroughs in England and  Wales, stimulated by the Ministry, andreinforced as regards  the Land  Settlement Scheme  by strongpatriotic sentiment,  has been to provide approximately, 30,000holdings on  an  area of 460,000  acres,  considerably  more  than half of  the holdings being bare land  holdings.   By comparison,therefore, the establishment in  five years on an area of 3,000,000acres of 100,000 family farms, all provided with equipment, and self-supporting, would be  a colossal task.   31. Figures are quoted in the memorandum with the intentionof showing that if all County Councils had administered the SmallHoldings Acts as vigorously as the four Counties mentioned, thenumber of small holdings created under the  Acts  would be over57,000 more than the actual number to-day, the  inference is drawnthat a large expansion of  small holdings would be possible if themore backward counties showed the same energy as those who havebeen most active.  There is, of course, much truth in this, but thefigure quoted above, although only given &quot; as  a broad indication &quot;is greatly exaggerated as  a result of overlooking two important factors : thus,  in three of the Counties mentioned (Cambridge,the Isle of  Ely and Norfolk),  the  average size of the holdingsprovided is only about half that of the holdings in the rest of thecountry.  In the Isle of Ely particularly, very large  numbers ofholdings are little more than allotments. If account is taken ofthese differences when making a comparison with activities in therest of the  Country the  figure of 57,000 would  be  reduced toabout 26,000.    32. This, however, would be on the assumption that other circumstances are comparable, which is far from being the case.The Counties mentioned contain large areas of land in proportion to the toal area of the  County which are very suitable for smallholdings ; a large area of fen land is included which is particularlyadapted for the use to which it has been put,  viz., for  the divisioninto comparatively  small plots for market  garden  cultivation.Several other Counties, on the other hand, contain but little landthat is suitable for the purpose of small  holdings proportionate tothe  total area  of the  County.  No  administrative activity willremedy this  physical fact.    33.  But the difference between the family farm proposals andthe Government programme is  in any event something more thana difference of degree.   Reference has been made in paragraph 26to  the  practical  considerations that have hitherto guided  smallholdings administration, viz., to fit the right man to the right land under conditions which are likely to ensure success.   Such  con-siderations would almost inevitably be swept aside in  the processof attempting to carry out a programme on the scale that is sug-gested.  One has to assume that it would be possible to set up thenecessary administrative machinery, central and local, for coping
with such a task (an ad hoc department  comparable, presumably,to the  Food  Production Department,  is  contemplated).   Butleaving aside this point, the attempt to  work out so ambitious a programme in such  a  limited time would be attended with thedanger that large numbers of ill-qualified persons would be placedon unsuitable land, with consequences which sooner or later would prove  disastrous ;   and  further  that  in many instances  wellqualified  persons,  both employers and  employed,  would bedisplaced from land  which suits them.   34. On page 44 of the Memorandum,  there is a quotation from paragraph 243 of the Final Report of the Agricultural tribunal of Investigation,  1924 (Cmd.  2145) in support of family farms.The succeeding paragraph  of  that Report, however, opens withthe words &quot; The development of  the small farm policy in GreatBritain must  be of  steady and careful growth,  but  it offers apolicy fundamental in character which for a long period is destinedto have far-reaching economic and social effects.&quot;   35. The wisdom of proceeding with caution, on which emphasiswas thus laid by the Tribunal, is hardly consistent with the proposal that 100,000 family farms should be established at the  rate of20,000 per year.  To convert so large a proportion of the cultivatedland of this country, presumably now occupied in larger units andemploying much hired labour*, into family farms, would be amomentous step which as  a condition precedent demands very careful examination.  Caution is particularly demanded because thesubdivision and re-equipment of these farms would either stereo-type them for a longer or shorter period, or would, if the policyfailed, involve the sacrifice of many millions of pounds spent on equipment, as well as the displacement of large numbers of existingfarmers and workers.   36. Reference is made on page 43 of the Liberal memorandum to the increased number of workers resulting from the creationof small  holdings ;  this is  incontestable  as the figures therequoted  from the Nairne Report  show.  The Ministry  itself hasevidence that  by careful selection it is possible to increase from two- to four-fold the population  resident on particular areas ofland as the result  of  division into small holdings.   Thus, on35 estates developed by County Councils in England and Waleson a total area of 16,000 acres the resident population was increased from 1,048 to 2,298.  Similarly, on three estates developed by theMinistry the resident population rose from 490 to 1,227.  In thecase of  a  further 13  Council schemes it was ascertained that thenumber of persons employed on the land prior to its conversion into small holdings was  80 and after conversion 313.  No suchresult  could, however, be anticipated  under a  scheme  of thedimensions proposed, where 3,000,000 acres of land would haveto be acquired, sub-divided,  re-equipped and  relet within  fiveyears.   Moreover it  is  to be observed that the larger the familyfarm the less scope there would be for those striking increases inresident population and employment which often accompany the conversion of  specially selected smaller  areas to intensive formsof cultivation.   Questions  arising in connection with  displacedpopulation under the  proposed  scheme are  discussed in para-graph 38.   37. It is obviously the intention under the Liberal scheme toavoid, as far as practicable, the  disturbance of existing familyfarmers and presumably the  scheme would  necessarily involvethe dispossession  of  many farmers, including  perhaps smallholders, who employ labour, and by limiting area and equipment,to discourage the new  family  farmers from employing labour aspart of  &quot; the true  remedy  for  the higher  hourly wage costs   * The Liberal memorandum gives an average labour cost of about /300a year on farms over 50 acres, and describes this charge as &quot; a formidableelement in agricultural costs.&quot;
resulting from the sound national policy of requiring a reasonableminimum agricultural  wage,&quot; for the  family farmer  &quot; neverenters the competitive  labour market, for, employing no hiredlabour, good or bad times are reflected in the personal standardof living and savings of himself and his family, and not  in totalunemployment.&quot;   The  family farmer  system &quot; eliminates hiredlabour costs.&quot;   38. Where is to be f ound this first instalment of 3,000,000 acres approaching 5,000  square miles ?  It is  to be &quot; good  averageland,&quot; much of it &quot; would be made suitable after reconditioning,&quot;and &quot; much of it would  be derived from breaking up farms whichare badly farmed or are too large to be economic with present wage rates  and prices.&quot;   The  total area under crops and grass in GreatBritain is 30,000,000 acres,  divided into 475,000 holdings above acre (average about 63 acres)  and providing employment for856,000  regular and casual hired workers.   According  to  the census of production carried  out by the Ministry  in 1925,  theaverage number of hired workers per 1,000 acres of crops and grasson holdings up to 50 acres ranged from 43-3 to 30-8, while onholdings above 50 acres  the range was from 29 - 9 to 27 - 2.   Of thetotal number of holdings in Great Britain, 94 - 454 exceed 100 acres,and only 14,684 (roughly 3 per cent.)  exceed 300 acres.   &quot; Largeholdings &quot; are stated in the Memorandum  to represent 22-9 percent,  of the total  area in Great Britain.  This corresponds to thearea covered by holdings over 300 acres, viz., about 7.000,000 acres(average 460 acres per holding).  If the 3,000,000 acres requiredare taken from the area covered by these larger holdings  and area fair sample of the whole 7,000,000  acres, about 6,300  farmers would be displaced (i.e., three-sevenths of 14,684), together with82,000 workers (i.e., average of 27-5 per 1,000 acres, or 13 perholding).  On this basis  the  total number displaced would be88,000.  If, however, it were found necessary to draw upon thelarger area covered by holdings of 50 acres or more, the positionwould be as follows, again assuming the part acquired were typicalof the whole: In  Great  Britain there are 167,000 occupiers ofholdings of  50 acres or more, and the area of these holdings is approximately 25,700,000 acres (average 154 acres per holding).The average number of  employees per 1,000 acres on holdings inthis category is 28 (or 4-3 per holding).  To take 3,000,000 acrestypical of this large area would displace 20,000 farmers and 86,000workers.  On this basis 106,000 agriculturists, including in most cases  whole  families, would be  disturbed and 100,000  famdyfarmers, largely drawn from the ranks of urban unemployed, butincluding also some of those who would be disturbed, put  in theirstead.   It is true that  a great proportion of the famdy farmers would,of necessity, be selected  from those having dependents who would assist on the holding.   Only thus could the elimination of hiredlabour be achieved.  But making every allowance  for this,  theextent to which existing  fanners and workers and their dependentswould be displaced is obviously an important item on the debitside of these proposals and is one to which very little consideration is given in the Liberal Memorandum, although it is contemplated that  part of the area to be  acquired wotdd be  drawn from land which requires reconditioning, where the scope for providing employment  may  be increased as the result of reconditioning.As pointed out above (para. 36), by the careful selection of suitableareas  of land the rural population may be increased substantiallyby sub-division into smaller units  ; but the extent of and the timeallowed for  the carrying out of the scheme  adumbrated in  theLiberal Memorandum are by no means  conducive  to  carefulselection.-  39. Even  if one  were  prepared  to contemplate  such  anupheaval it must  be remembered that not all land is suitablefor family settlement.  There  are many factors to be consideredbefore a farm can be adjudged to be suitable for small holdings,and failure  to recognise this fact would imperil any scheme ofland  settlement.    For  example, the downlands of Berkshireor the heavy clays of Essex are  not likely to provide  a large
9 Q -S60inumber  of  such family  farms.   Other  factors which requireserious consideration, unless much money is to be wasted, arethe facilities  which a  farm presents for sub-division  and re-equipment,  the proximity to markets, and the prospect of  their development,  the means of access, etc., etc.   40. It would be  impossible  to  acquire  3,000,000 acres ofsuch land in  this country with vacant possession,  or even the600,000 acres  required for the first 20,000 holdings.  It would inmany cases be necessary either to serve notices to quit, whichmay defer the date for vacant possession for as much as 2 years,with a liability to pay compensation for disturbances as well asthe tenant right claim of the dispossessed occupier.   The alterna-tive would be to extinguish the occupiers&apos; interest compulsorily,which  might  involve responsibility for  further compensationfor growing crops and loss on the forced sale of stock.  Furthermoreit would be  necessary to contemplate the  provision of accommo-dation elsewhere for displaced population on which subject theLiberal Memorandum is silent.   41. It is  proposed  to acquire land  subject to an annualrent-charge.   If the capital value of the charge to be created isto be equivalent to the  capital  value  of the land, there is no obvious advantage  to the State apart from the saving in capitaloutlay.   If,  however, the  capital value of the charge is to be lessthan the capital market value of the land, it is clear that acquisi-tion  would involve  some  measure of  confiscation.   In  thisconnection,  it is of importance  to remember  that only  thoseowners would be penalised whose land is selected for acquisition.   42. The  task of  selecting and removing  100,000 families andtraining  those who did  not possess  the necessary experience(in ah probability  the great majority) would obviously be oneof considerable magnitude.   Family farmers are to be recruited from         (a) Competent farm workers and  farmers&apos; sons.        (b) AUotment holders.        (c) Trainees (urban unemployed).The  trainees  (including some  of  the allotment holders) might perhaps  be  expected to constitute say 75 per cent, of the pro-spective  settlers, i.e.,  15,000 a year.  This would require theestablishment of a large number of training  centres  with the requisite equipment and  staff.  In the case  of some at least ofthe untrained settlers,  training would also be necessary forother members  of  their  families.  This is a difficult  problem,owing to the  impossibility of the wife leaving her family for aperiod of training,  but it is of some importance in considering any scheme for the rapid establishment of family farms on anysuch scale and in  any such time as that contemplated in theLiberal Memorandum.  It would also be necessary in any eventto contemplate that some of the trainees will fail to qualify for family farms,  thereby increasing  the number for whom training and training accommodation will have to be provided.   43. The  execution  of  the  Liberal  proposals   as  regardsagriculture  in anything like the  period suggested,  means reallyan  agricultural dictatorship, endowed with very  large funds,free from the  existing restrictions in such matters as compulsory acquisition of  land, detailed Parliamentary approval of estimates,etc.  It  is at  least doubtful how far Parliament or the country would stand such a proposal in a time of peace   44. An attempt is made in Appendix II to summarise thefinancial aspects of the Liberal proposals.   It must be explained,however, that the manner  in which  the  various  data in theLiberal Memorandum are scattered about,  the document, the lackof precision  and the absence of any convenient summary make itdifficult  to  check  the  resultant  estimates of  cost.  In theMemorandum the capital cost of the entire agricultural programme is put at from  25,000,000 to  40,000,000 a year- over a period of5  years.  From this it is concluded  that the capital sum to bemade available would  &quot; probably  exceed  100,000,000.&quot;   this figure bears no obvious relation  to  the yearly figures, the totalof which, on  a rising scale over the 5 years, would  be more like
 170,000,000.   Even  this figure,  however,  is greatly under-estimated.   It is shown in the  Appendix, by such data as  areto be found in the Liberal Memorandum and by adding necessaryitems of expenditure for which no provision is there made, thatthe capital outlay  might  be  anything  up  to   315,000,000.Similarly as  regards the annual cost of  the scheme.  This is put in the Liberal Memorandum at  6,000,000, of which  3,000,000represents loss on the  family farms, re-condilioning of land andre-equipment,  and  the other   3,000,000  the cost   of  aidingtransport,  advertising  and marketing British grown  food-stuffs(both temporary) and  the net loss on  the training centres.  TheMinistry&apos;s estimate,  again based on the Memorandum, of annual cost is approximately   9,000,000, and is set out in detail  in  theAppendix.   45. The ultimate combined effect on employment of  thevarious proposals is estimated in the Liberal Memorandum  to bean  increase of  500,000 in the number of persons employed inagriculture and ancillary industries.  It is further contemplated that in the meantime employment  would be found for a further150,000 men to be employed  for five years on preparatory work.Apart  from the  100,000 family farmers and the 150,000 men tobe employed (temporarily) on re-equipment and re-conditioning,in respect of which there is some attempt  to give particulars,  theestimated addition to the numbers employed is entirely conjectural,and no data are given in support of the figures.  The number is obviously subject to a considerable deduction (not referred to inthe Memorandum) in  respect of  workers displaced  elsewhere,e.g., as  the result of reduction of imports.  Against the 100,000family farmers (and their working dependents) must be offset the farmers and farm workers displaced from the 3,000,000 acresconverted to family farms (see para. 38).              SECTION 3. CREDIT FACILTITES.   46. In the Liberal  Memorandum it is  stated that  the farmerhas no access to easy agricultural credit,  and &quot; is  utterly unableto undertake that continuous capital outlay which  in agriculture,as in other industries, is necessary  if his  methods of  production are to enable him to hold his own  in the British  food market.&quot;Agricultural  long term  credit in Great Britain is cheap in comparison with  many overseas  and European  countries,  andis readily  accessible.   The rate of  interest  charged by  theAgricultural Mortgage Corporation on long term loans, and loansunder  the Lands Improvement Acts,  is far lower  than in manycentral and eastern European countries, lower than in some states in the  United  States, and lower than in some other countries,even when the credit system involves some measure of subsidy bythe State.   47. In regard to accessibility to credit, this for a farmer, as for any other borrower, depends ultimately on the security hehas to offer.  In this  country, farmers have access to the mainsource of short term credit, namely, that  provided by the  banks,on  the same  terms  as any  other individual  borrowers.  Thepurpose of the  Agricultural  Credits  Act of 1928, which  comes into full operation  on  1st  January next,  is  to increase  theaccessibility of bank credit to the ordinary farmer  by  mobilising,as far as possible, his farming assets for the purpose of borrowing from the banks.   The difficulty which now remains is not so much the inaccessibility or the cost of credit, as  that the  farmer&apos;s creditresources are either largely exhausted, as  is probably  the case inpart of the distressed  arable  districts,  or that they have  notlearned to make  full use of the  facilities of  the agricultural credits Act.  Special credit facilities will of course be required forthe unemployed  settled on the land under  the  government&apos;s proposals, and Parliament will be asked  to make  the necessary provision.                 SECTION 4.-MARKETING.   48. Actual figures  as to  the proportion  of the  consumersprice  received by the  farmer must of necessity be hypothetical,for the distributive margin varies widely from product  to product,from season to season, from  place  to  place and frequently from
shop to shop.  It is probably sufficient to endorse the LinlithgowCommittee&apos;s  finding (in its Final Report)  that  &quot; the costs of distribution are far too great for society permanently to consent to bear.&quot;  With the present slump in commodity prices, distribu-tive costs are, of  course, a  proportionately greater burden thanin 1924, when the Linlithgow Committee reported.    49. In regard to the Marketing Bill, the suggestion that theinitiative in drafting schemes and submitting them to producersshould be entrusted to some statutory authority, has much torecommend it.  At the same time,  though it is true that &quot; thenormal farmer is a producer and not a distributor,&quot; it is probablytrue that a greater proportion of farmers in this country are alsodistributors than in any other country in the world.  The dimen-sions of the  producer-retailer  element,  for example, need  noemphasis.    50.  It would be  wrong  to  overlook  the evidence already existing as to  the ability of our producers to organise themselves for marketing or to  produce or consider schemes with that end inview, and it can be taken for granted that when the marketing bill is passed, there will be no shortage of schemes for farmers toconsider.   In practice,  the  Ministry will, of  course,  take  a prominent part in educating farming opinion on the need andadvantages of organisation.    On this last point, the present  Government has added tothe Markets  Division  of the Ministry an  Organisation  Branchfor the special study of problems of marketing organisation, forthe publishing of a new series of Orange Books devoted exclusively to that subject, for the practical demonstration of features of marketing organisation and for the formulation of organisationschemes.  This work matches the Ministry&apos;s work on the standard-isation side, just  as the Governments Marketing Bill is comple-mentary to the  Agricultural Produce  (Grading and  Marking)Act of the late  Government.   51. The Minister can hardly propose and  canvas his ownschemes because, in effect, this would put him in the position,under the Bill, of judge and advocate of his own cause.  A statutory commission set up  for the purpose, as suggested in  the  Liberalproposals, would not  have  this  disadvantage,  but it  wouldcertainly need to use the Ministers  expert staff for the formula-tion of schemes,  and if the Commission is to be a separate body,there is no reason to think this would work well in practice.   52. If an immediately active policy is desired, the Bill mightbe  amended  to require the Minister  to set up,  under his ownDepartmental aegis, a  Preparatory  Committee as regards anyproduct in respect  of  which, in the Ministers view, there is ademand for organised marketing on the part of producers and no scheme regulating the  marketing  of that product has been sub-mitted under  the Act.    The committee to be charged with theduty of preparing a draft scheme for that product and the Ministerto be required to take adequate steps to bring the committee&apos;scheme to the notice of the farmers concerned.  That is, in effect,all  that the  Liberal Memorandum  asks  for, and this questionof initiative in such matters is being further explored in theDepartment.             SECTION 5. THE QUOTA PLAN.   53.  There  are replies to  the points raised in the  LiberalMemorandum on the Quota  Plan,  but in view  of the presentposition of this proposal it is not intended to deal with the matter further in this Memorandum.SECTION  6.-INCREASING THE CONSUMPTION OP BRITISH                          FOODS.   54.  The Liberal Memorandum is  right  [vide  Section  XII).Far too little attention has  been given,  in past  years,  to thepossibility of  increasing the consumption of home-grown produce and yet it would be wrong to assume that only a little has been attempted and only a little is being done.
   55. It is important to keep clearly in mind the  three maintypes of publicity  in  this particular field.  There  is first thecreation of a favourable atmosphere-of a disposition  on the partof the public  to give  a  preference to home-produce.  &quot; Back-ground &quot; work of this  type affecting home-produce in the  masshas  been carried out  for the last  four years by the empire marketing Board which,  in its appeal to consumers,  puts homeproduce first.   56. The second  kind  of publicity is  &quot; foreground &quot; publicityof the &quot; Eat More or &quot; Drink More &quot; kind.  The Liberal Memo-randum  gives  milk as  an dlustration of the possibilities in thisdirection.  The pioducers concerned should, however, organiseon commodity lines to do this kind of thing for themselves, andthe Governments Marketing Bdl provides the means.   57. The third kind of publicity &quot; Mark &quot; publicity is also of the &quot; foreground &quot; type.  Experience in the marketing of homeproduce shows that, for  optimum sales  results, there must be aguarantee both of origin and quality.  The former,  by itself, isnot  enough.   The latter implies  standardisation.  The two can best be expressed through a mark. This is the raison d&apos;etre of theNational Mark schemes under the Agricultural Produce (Gradingand Marking)  Act, 1928.   The Liberal Memorandum suggests, forexample, that it should be possible to recreate a demand for theall British loaf ;  but to do this, it is necessary to guarantee the origin of the  flour and most important its  intrinsic quality.The National  Mark flour scheme now scarcely a year old is anattempt to do this.   58. The Government  has made a special grant of   55,000 this financial year  for publicity for National Mark produce. All markproducts benefit equally because a common mark is used; themaximum effect is thus obtained at the minimum of cost.  Further,by stimulating demand for National Mark produce, the agri-cultural industry is encouraged  to  persevere  with  the  variousstandardisation schemes, with  the  results that  should  be  ofincalculable benefit to  agriculture and to the nation.    59.  The Liberal Memorandum recognises that if  publicity isto be effective, the farmer must produce and market properly.It may be inferred, therefore, that Mark publicity is approved asbeing the only  n on-wasteful &quot; foreground &quot; publicity that  theState can properly support.  The Liberal Memorandum apparentlycontemplates  more expenditure on publicity than is the case atpresent and the creation of a special Board,  like  the empire marketing Board, to undertake the task.  (See also Section XV ofthe Liberal proposals).   It may or may not  be necessary toprovide more money for Mark publicity in future years :  this canonly be determined in the light of the experience now being gainedwith the first year&apos;s Vote.  It is desirable, however, to bear inmind that the industry  should, sooner  or  later,   make some contribution to Mark publicity and it is to be hoped that, when the Marketing Bill is  passed, commodity marketing schemes  will come into being in which due provision is made for publicity services.  The Ministry  of Agriculture is directly administering the present grant for Mark publicity ; the Departments methods have met with general approval and if only because the officers in the  markets division of  the Ministry who  are engaged in standardisation  and publicity work respectively  must maintain the closest contact in practice, it would be disadvantageous to set  up a separate Board for publicity purposes.               SECTION 7. RAIL TRANSPORT.     60. According to the Liberal  Memorandum (p. 46), one of the foundations upon which  an agricultural revival must rest is the improvement  and  cheapening of  &quot; the collection and transporta- tion of domestic farm produce  so  that  British agriculture will have that natural advantage as against the foreign produce in the home market  which geography prescribes instead of being, as at present, at  a disadvantage.&quot;  The Liberal Memorandum
 suggests that the State should negotiate with railway and port authorities  reduced preferential  inland rates for  British  farm produce, the cost to be met by increased rates on foreign produce and, if necessary, by a subsidy.    61. The  Minister  of  Transport  is  the Minister  primarily concerned with railway rates and facilities.  The following brief notes indicate the present position so far as agriculture is concerned.    62. The &quot; standard &quot;  or normal  rates for the conveyance of goods, including agricultural  produce, by rail, are fixed by the Railvray Rates Tribunal, set  up  under the Railways Act,  1921. The rates now in operation were fixed recently, after hearings extending over a  lengthy period, and they came into  operation as from  1st January,  1928.  Appeals against &quot; standard &quot;  rates may be heard by the Tribunal.    63.  On account of tb eir relatively low value, many agricultural products  such as manures and grain, have always been carried at very low rates relative to  those for higher grade  traffics.  The average receipts of the railway companies per ton-mile for grain, beet, potatoes, oilcake and manures  are in the neighbourhood of half of those in respect  of hardware, cotton and artificial silk. The railway companies have power to fix  &quot; exceptional&quot;  rates for traffics without reference to the Tribunal, provided that  these rates are more than 5 per  cent,  and not more than 40 per  cent. below  the &quot; standard &quot; rates.  &quot; Exceptional rates &quot; have  been granted  in  very  large  numbers for agricultural traffics;  the number  granted in 1929 was considerably in excess of those granted in 1928.   64. Under Section 27  of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, the railway companies are prohibited from making any differentiation in the rates for the carriage of home  and foreign merchandise in respect of the same or simdar services.  There are of course rates in operation under which foreign produce, being offered in large quantities or under conditions specially facilitating handling and loading, is conveyed on better terms than the home grower can obtain for small quantities.   65. It will be seen that to carry out Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposal for preferential rates would require an amendment of the existing law, which  would certainly be contentious and might  also  raise international  questions.   There is room for considerable doubt whether the British Government may not be precluded by existing conventions, to which Great Britain is a party, from discriminatingbetween home and foreign products in the matter of railway rates.   66. There is further the question of the effect of any reduction of rates upon railway revenues.  The basis of the rates now in  force is fixed under the provisions  of the Railways  Act, 1921, so that thecompanies should be  able to obtain, so far as practicable, a standardrevenue.   It might be argued that the increase in traffic resultingfrom a reduction of rates would be such as to leave the amount ofrevenue unaffected.  Past experience does not support this view.Under the Local Government Act, 1929,  the railway companies are relieved from the payment of part of their rates on condition that the money saved is used in the reduction of  the railway freight charges for certain selected traffics, including the followingagricultural traffics : (1) manures of most kinds ;  (2) a number of feeding stuffs for animals  and poultry ; (3) potatoes  (except newpotatoes) ; (4) milk  ; (5)  livestock.  The total amount  of rebatemade available for these classes of traffic is some  700,000 a year,which in 1929 represented an  average rebate of 9-4 per cent, onthe gross charges for these traffics, or  about Id. on seven gallons of milk and Is. 2d. per  ton on other commodities.  Notwithstandingthese substantial rebates, the railroad traffic of these classes ofgoods,  except  potatoes, was appreciably less in 1929 than in 1928.It cannot be expected that a reduction in railway rates will have any  large immediate effect in increasing traffic, though someexpansion might follow in time.
   67. It would therefore be necessary to  make up in some other way to railway companies for the loss of revenue which must beexpected to follow from a reduction in rates for home agricultural products. The possible methods appear to be         (a) increased rates for imported agricultural produce ;        (b) increased rates on some classes of non-agricultural             goods;        (c) a subsidy.   68. As regards (a) the international difficulties of discrimina-tion have been indicated above.  It must also be rememberedthat there is great practical difficulty in  distinguishing betweenhome and foreign  produce in the case of the carriage within thecountry of  some  agricultural commodities.   As regards (b)  it is obvious  that there will be the strongestopposition to an increase in rates on  other goods for the benefitof agriculture.   Such  a change could only tend to drive more of such goods on to the road,  and the burden would tend to fallon the products of the depressed industries which are least able tosupport it.   The proposal for a State subsidy raises important questionsof principle. Apart from these, in any scheme of  this kind theclaim  of other  forms  of transport, such as coastwise shippingcompeting with railways, could not be overlooked, and there still remain the international difficulties of rate discrimination betweenimported and home-grown commodities of the same description.    69.  It may be  asked whether it is not  possible to increase theamount of rebates under the Local Government Act, 1929.  this could only be done if the basis of that Act were revised, and theadditional rebate  would have to be either at  the expense of theother rebated traffics (certain classes  of coal, iron, etc.) or at theexpense of  the  Treasury.  It  would not be practicable to throwthe  cost upon  the local authorities of the country by increasingthe  present 75 per cent, relief from rates, from which the rebatefund is derived.    70. It must also be borne in mind that where railway charges are  not paid directly by the farmer, a part of any apparent gain by reduced rates must almost inevitably  find its way, for a time at all events, into the pockets of distributors, or at least be lostsight of among price fluctuations due to another cause.    71. The proper solution of the matter  is, as was recommended by the Linlithgow Committee, to be found in the bulking of traffic, which  secures lower charges  and can already be utilised by alltraders.              SECTION 8. ROAD TRANSPORT.     72. The question of rural roads in relation to agriculture has been dealt with in the Memorandum by the Minister of Transport, with which I am in agreement.            SECTION  9.-DOCKS AND HARBOURS.     73.  The Liberal Memorandnm does not suggest that the finan- cial assistance from the Government for the construction and improvement  of  docks and harbours is  inadequate ;  on  the contrary, the Memorandum points out that grants for the schemes referred to could be  made under Part  II of the  Development (Loan Guarantees and  Grants)  Act, 1929.   As a matter of fact, there is ample administrative machinery  for assisting schemes for the construction  or improvement of docks and harbours. Where the docks  and harbours are controlled by public utility under- takings trading for profit, assistance may be obtained under  Part I of the Development Act, 1929, and where the docks and harbours are controlled by the local authorities or statutory  bodies  not trading for profit, public assistance is available under Part  II of the Act.
   74.   In  addition,   advances  may  be  made  from  theDevelopment   Fund   under   the   Development  and  RoadImprovement  Funds Act,  1909,  in aid  of  the construction and improvement of harbours used mainly by the fishing industryand controlled by bodies not trading for profit.  Save in quiteexceptional circumstances in connection with advances from theDevelopment Fund, in all cases some local contribution is required.Under  the Development Act, 1929, regulations  have been made which  lay down the  amount of local contribution which  will berequired.  The Development Commissioners, however, have no definite rules but consider each case on its merits. In all cases theinitiative rests with the locality concerned, and  if the amount ofwork put in hand up  to the present is not considered to have been sufficient, the only method of accelerating the pace seems to be,either  to urge the local authorities  to make applications, or  toincrease the proportion of  the  Government contribution.  It isnot considered that either course is desirable in the case of fisheryharbours.  The Development Fund  grants are  made on  a  verygenerous basis already, and the stimulation of further applicationswould  only lead to the submission  of schemes which could notbe justified and which would have to be rejected.   75.  The Liberal Memorandum does not  suggest that Govern-ment  assistance under  the  Development Act  is  not generousenough.  It is to be inferred that the  authors of the Memorandumwill only support  schemes which are economically sound.  Pre-sumably, this expression is not to be taken too literally,  sinceeconomically sound schemes, i.e., schemes which would yield  anadequate return on the capital outlay, would not require financialassistance from the Government.  The authors  of the Memoran-dum do, however, presumably  mean that there should be  somereturn at any rate on the capital expenditure, and adequate localcontribution is probably the best test of this.   76. The  Report of the Port Facilities Committee, referred toin the  Memorandum, recommended that a new  tidal dock shouldbe constructed at Great Yarmouth.  The Great Yarmouth port and Haven Commissioners made an  application for a grant fromthe Development  Fund to cover the whole cost of constructingsuch a basin, estimated at  192,000. The Commissioners did not anticipate any increase  of revenue as a result of the constructionof this dock, arid they stated that they were unable to contributeany of the capital cost themselves as they would have to bear theheavy charges of maintenance.  They were informed that theDevelopment  Commissioners were  not prepared to recommendassistance to this scheme in the absence of a substantial localcontribution towards the capital cost.    77. So  far  as fishery  harbours and docks  are  concerned,certain improvements have recently been carried out at milford haven with the assistance of a  grant under Part I of theDevelopment  Act.  The grant takes the form  of interest at therate of 5 per cent, for 6 years on capital expenditure  within amaximum of  14,762 in respect of the extension of coal storagesidings, the erection of an additional  coal tip  and an extensionof the trawl market.    78. On the 22nd April, 1929, a grant from the unemployment grants Committee was sanctioned for the construction of a newfish dock at Grimsby.  The grant amounts to 50 per cent, of theinterest on approved expenditure out of loans raised to meet thecost, not exceeding  1,250,000 the grant to be payable for 15 years or for the period of the loan, whichever is the less.  The firstsod in connection with this work is likely to be turned this month.    79. So far as the smaller  fishery  harbours in  England andWales are concerned, at the present time works are proceeding at Port Isaac, Staithes,  Bridlington and  Poole with assistancefrom  the Development Fund.   At Port Isaac a grant of  13,300 and a loan of   11,300  have been sanctioned, and an application for a further grant is under consideration, in aid of works estimated to cost about  35,000 altogether.  At Staithes the Development
State forScotland.)           Fund grant amounts to  30,750 and the local contribution to            2,000.  At Biidlington a  Development Fund grant&apos; (amounting           to two-thirds of the cost) up to a maximum of  7,000 has been           approved.  At Poole a  Development Fund  grant of  1,000 in           aid of the construction of a breakwater estimated to cost  2,800           has been approved.              80. The Development  Commissioners  have now under con-           sideration an application for assistance for schemes for new break-           waters estimated  to cost  25,000 at sea houses and  45,000 at           St. Ives.  A  grant of  620 has also been approved for  minor           improvements at  Mousehole, Cornwall, and a grant of  150 for           minor improvements at Portloe.              81. A general  review  of the position of the small fishery           harbours in Great Britain is under consideration by  the Fisheries           Committee of the Economic Advisory Council.                SECTION 10.-FISHERY  HARBOURS IN SCOTLAND.(Note by the    82.  For the development, improvement and repair of fisheryl^etary of harbours in Scotland assistance is available from the Development           Fund established  under the Development, etc., Funds Act,  1909,           the Piers or Quays Fund  established under  an Act dated 1824           and administered by the  Fishery Board  for Scotland,  and the           Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act,  1929.              S3. To meet agricultural and fishery requirements in  Great           Britain  the Development  Fund was augmented by a special           grant of  500,000, and in addition to the advances made directly           from the Fund (as so augmented) a special provision of  39,000           (recoverable from  that Fund to the extent of   37,000) was placed           on the Fishery Board&apos;s Vote for 1930-31  to  enable grants to be           made for the reconditioning and special repair and dredging of           Scottish fishery harbours, while the annual grant  to the  Piers           or Ouays Fund has been restored to its statutory maximum of            3,000.              84. Since the Government took office in June,  1929, advances           from one  or  other of the sources mentioned in the preceding           paragraph amounting in all to  189,538 have been sanctioned           towards the cost of schemes of harbour improvement or special           repairs  estimated  to  cost   272,000.  Of  the  total  advances           sanctioned  141,695 were grants and  47,S43 loans.              85. Further schemes at a total estimated cost  of  200,000           are at present under consideration ; some  of these  may not  on           examination be found to be justifiable economically, and in others           the absence of a duly constituted harbour authority may delay           action, but a continuance of the policy followed since June,  1929,           should result in all fishery harbours which fall within the scope           of the above-mentioned funds and are necessary for the successful           prosecution of the fisheries being placed in a condition to fulfil           their functions satisfactorily.              86. At  Stornoway  a  scheme  of improvements  including           dredging estimated to cost  42,000 is being undertaken by the           Harbour Authority,  but  as the  authority  can  give  sufficient           security for a loan from the Public Works Loan Board no grant           from the above funds has been found to be necessary.              87. The foregoing remarks  refer specially to harbours  which           are mainly for fishery purposes and are used by the herring and           small lining fleets.  The trawling industry is based on general           commercial   ports Aberdeen,  Leith  (including   Newhaven),           Granton and  Dundee.   It may,  however,  be mentioned that           substantial  improvements covering the  facilities  for  fishing           vessels are being carried out at Aberdeen by means of assistance           under the  Act of 1929 mentioned in  the first paragraph of           this note.              88. At  Lerwick Harbour,  two  schemes estimated to cost            29,800 and   16,500 respectively have been proposed, but the           fishery interest in these schemes is  subsidiary and the case  is           prima facie one for utilisation of the Act of 1929.
   89. As regards the  employment value of the  schemes for improvement or  reconditioning of fishery  harbours to  whichI have referred, it is estimated that  approximately  6 of costrepresents the direct  employment on the site of one man perweek.  Indirect  employment, in the  preparation of materials,etc., has also to be taken into account. SECTION 11.-AGRICULTURAL PROPOSALS IN RELATION                     TO SCOTLAND.   90. The Liberal proposals contemplate                     (Note by the        (a) the revival of agriculture ;                           State^fo? 0        (b) the provision of  employment through the revival of Scotland.)    agriculture.   With regard  to  the  revival of agriculture, the first sectionsof the Report present a comprehensive statement which in somerespect is descriptive of the present condition of British agriculture.Too  much emphasis,  however, is laid upon the decline of theindustry.   It cannot be asserted that in Scotland the conditionsare so unsatisfactory.  It is true that, on the whole, the organisa-tion  of  the industry is inferior to that  of some  other countries,and  that in some parts of the country  farmers have insufficientcapital  and poor equipment, but  in the actual cultivation of the soil and the management of stock, comparison with continentalmethods  is not unfavourable to British.  Farming  is chieflyunsatisfactory,  in that full advantage is not taken  of  recentadvances in  knowledge and systems  of farming have not been altered  to  meet modern conditions.  Up till recently agriculture in Scotland anyhow has at least held its own over by far the largerpart  of the country.  The  conclusion  of the Liberal proposals that the intensive production  of  animal products  should be themain development  of British  agriculture, is shown to be soundby the Scottish experience of the  last thirty years.   91.  It is suggested in the Liberal proposals that the basis uponwhich an agricultural revival must rest is  fivefold         (1) The  State  should assume  the responsibility of the     landlord in  capitalising and re-equipping certain portions of     British agriculture.   This re-equipment  by  some means  is necessary if largenumbers of  farmers  are to be able to compete with overseasproducts.        (2) The  collection  and transportation of farm produce     should be improved and  cheapened.   This  is highly desirable,  even  though  it  should  involve a subsidy to the railways in some cases.        (3) Marketing should  be organised.    This is provided for in the Marketing Bill now published.        (4) The consumption of foodstuffs of British origin should     be expanded by methods  of salesmanship and advertisement.    There  is great room for  such  activity.   If,  for example, the   Scots consumed as  much milk per  head as  the  Swedes, there would not  be sufficient land in Scotland to graze and feed the  dairy cows  required  under  present  conditions  of management.    The above proposals, if put  into operation  in  combination with  the  research   and  education  now  going on,   would eventually go far  to  revive existing agriculture and  secure its  modification so  that  it  could  compete  with  foreign and overseas producers.  The methods  by which these suggestions should  take  effect cannot,  however,  be  dealt  with fully  in this  note.         (5) The main point, however, of the Liberal proposals is      to develop the family farm system by creating 100,000 family      farms as a first instalment of a  national policy.
   From the  Scottish  standpoint  this would mean provisionfor 20,000 families  in five years.  The Department of  Agricul-ture has been carrying out  this  policy for the  provision of family farms  since  1911,  and has many years experience ofsuch work.  Surveys have been made of land suitable for smallholdings in  every county.   Other  surveys have been made ofland suitable for reclamation or reconditioning.   The rapid expansion  of  the  system is,  however, a serious matter.  In the experience of - the Department of Agriculture itwould not be possible to settle more than 600 to 700 families say  3,000 to  4,000 individuals per annum without incurringheavy compensation charges for breaking leases and providingfor a large increase in administrative and technical staff.  It isproposed, however,  that 5,000 families should be settled in eachof four of five years.   The area of  land  required  for such a  scheme cannot be closely estimated, but  it could not be less than from half amillion to a million acres.   To convert existing farms to suchan extent  would mean the  dislocation of  from  one-eighth toone-fifth of the  land   now  under crops and grass, but  suchcomplete conversion need not be  assumed  as there are  large areas  of Scotland  capable of reclamation  and reconditioningwhich would provide  new  land  for  family farms.   In  theevent  of the adoption  of  the family  farm  policy  the  reclama-tion of land has the advantage that it displaces the minimumnumber  of  existing  occupiers, it  provides  greater scope  for employment of labour  in draining, fencing, roadmaking,  etc.,than when existing farm  land is converted,  and finally, it addsa permanent tangible asset to the State.    From  the  standpoint  of  unemployment  and  the  socialadvantage  of  maintaining  a  larger  rural population  it isdesirable  to make  such an  effort as is proposed.    In Scotland,  where  long leases are customary, it  does  not seem  feasible  to  create  family  farms  as  speedily  as  theMemorandum suggests.  The  rapid creation of family  farmswould involve the use of  compulsory powers  for  the acquisi-tion  of  land on a large scale,  the  breaking of leases,  with corresponding  compensation,  and  greatly  increased  adminis-trative expenses.    On the  other  hand, reclamation  works interfere  with no existing industry and in so far as they relieve the UnemploymentFund they reduce the net cost to the State of the land which theyimprove,  and  families  would be  retained  in  this country asproductive units at less  cost than they could be settled on similarland as potential competitors in Canada and  Australia.    Under the  proposals of  the Agricultural Land (Utilisation)Bill substantial financial  provision will  be  authorised for thereclamation of land in  Scotland.  The  reclamation  of  this land will enable groups  of family farms to be created.   In connexionwith this policy, I have reason to believe  that a Canadian  donorwill provide a fully equipped demonstration  farm on at least one area in contemplation.    93. In general,  and so far as Scotland is  concerned,  I am in agreement  with  the policy for the revival of agriculture and thecreation of family  farms described in  the Memorandum, subject to consideration of the  details and of the provision  of ways and  means.
              PART  IV.Emergency  Works  of Development.            SECTION 1. ROADS AND BRIDGES.   1. Mr.  Lloyd  George  observes  that  there  is  substantial (Note by thecoincidence  between  the proposals of the present  Government Minister of with regard to roads and bridges and those outlined in the Liberal  rpamphlet of 1929.   It  may  be recalled that the total highwayexpenditure of Great Britain (including expenditure out of loansbut excluding loan charges) is in the neighbourhood of  58 millions a year.  Apart from the heavy annual expenditure incurred uponthe maintenance of classified roads and bridges (estimated at over 20 millions in 1929-30) and on the  maintenance of unclassifiedrural roads (costing about  8 millions a year), the position in regardto  major  improvements   not included in  any  of the  aboveexpenditure may be restated as follows :                                                         First, there was outstanding at the 30th September,     1930, in respect of improvement schemes in hand     or approved prior to that date and not included     in the  Trunk  Road,  five-years  or annual pro-     grammes hereinafter referred to, expenditure on     schemes amounting approximately to ..     ..  15,000,000(This aggregate figure includes all uncompleted works     under old programmes, as well as some important     individual schemes such as the Mersey Tunnel and     the East Lancashire Road authorised by previous     Governments.)Next, there is the Trunk Road Programme, represent-     ing  entirely new work initiated by the present     Government and recently raised to a total of ..  21,000,000Then, there is the Five Years&apos; Programme of major     improvements on classified roads (and bridges).  .  27,500,000(It is not possible to say how much of this would have     been  covered by  any  annual  allocations that     might otherwise have been authorised from year     to year.)Special  London Schemes, excluding Charing Cross     Bridge represent a total of      ......  12,300,000(This includes  5,900,000 for the Victoria Dock Road,     Waterloo, Lambeth and Hampton Court Bridges     and the New  Chertsey  Road authorised by  the     late Government, and   6,400,000 for the Dartford-     Purfleet Tunnel, the Elephant and Castle Scheme,     Chelsea and Putney Bridges and Vauxhall Cross     authorised by the present  Government.)To this must be added the  recent approval of a section     of the Western Exit  (Cromwell Road Scheme),     the total cost of which is estimated at ..    ..   2,400,000    Mr. Lloyd George states  (page 105)  that the total expenditure con- templated in the present Governments  Five Year Programme includes  23,200,000 for improvement works already in hand on all kinds of roads. It should be explained that the  23,200,000 represents  the estimate of outstanding liabilities of the Road Fund and local authorities in respect of all works uncompleted at 31st March, 1930 ; it also includes some balances outstanding in  respect of work which had been finished by that date although the account had not yet been settled.    Mr. Lloyd George also refers to the figure of  20,000,000 mentioned in the House of Commons in May, 1930, as the maximum amount which it had been suggested  might be spent on additional works  if 100 per cent. grants were to be made.  Since that figure was given, however, the total of the Trunk Road and  Five Year Programmes has been increased by  9,500,000.  The  20,000,000 estimate was based on a &quot;  probability &quot; of 100 per cent, grants, but some part of it may be absorbed in the  9,500,000 which has been added to the Trunk Road Programmes on a basis of grants of less than 100 per cent.
              PART  IV.Emergency  Works  of Development.            SECTION 1. ROADS AND BRIDGES.   1. Mr.  Lloyd  George  observes  that  there  is  substantial (Note by thecoincidence between  the proposals of the present  Government Minister of with regard to roads and bridges and those outlined in the Liberal  rpamphlet of 1929.  It may  be recalled that the total highwayexpenditure of Great  Britain (including expenditure out of loansbut excluding loan charges) is in the neighbourhood of  58 millions a year.  Apart from the heavy annual expenditure incurred uponthe maintenance of classified  roads and bridges (estimated at over 20  millions in 1929-30) and on the  maintenance of unclassifiedrural roads (costing about  8 millions a year), the position in regardto  major  improvements not included in  any of the  aboveexpenditure may be restated as follows :                                                         First, there was outstanding at the 30th September,     1930, in respect of improvement schemes in hand     or approved prior to that date and not included     in the Trunk  Road, five-years  or annual pro-     grammes hereinafter referred to, expenditure on     schemes amounting approximately to ..     ..  15,000,000(This aggregate figure includes all uncompleted works     under old programmes, as well as some important     individual schemes such as the Mersey Tunnel and     the East Lancashire Road authorised by previous     Governments.)Next, there is the Trunk Road Programme, represent-     ing  entirely new work  initiated by the  present     Government and recently raised to a total of ..  21,000,000Then, there is the Five Years&apos; Programme of major     improvements on classified roads (and bridges)..  27,500,000 (It is not possible to say how much of this would have     been  covered by any  annual  allocations  that     might otherwise have been authorised from year     to year.) Special  London Schemes,  excluding Charing Cross     Bridge represent a total of      ......   12,300,000 (This includes  5,900,000 for the Victoria Dock Road,     Waterloo, Lambeth and Hampton Court Bridges     and the New Chertsey  Road authorised by the     late Government, and  6,400,000 for the Dartf ord-     Purfleet Tunnel, the Elephant and Castle Scheme,     Chelsea and Putney Bridges and Vauxhall Cross     authorised by the present Government.) To this must be added the recent approval of a section     of the  Western Exit (Cromwell Road  Scheme),     the total cost of which  is estimated at  ..     ..    2,400,000     Mr. Lloyd George states (page  105)  that the total expenditure con- templated  in the present Governments Five Year Programme includes  23,200,000 for improvement works already in hand on all kinds of roads. It should  be explained that the  23,200,000 represents  the estimate of outstanding liabilities of the Road Fund and local authorities in respect of all works uncompleted  at 31st March, 1930 ; it also includes some balances outstanding  in respect of work which  had been finished by that date although the account had not yet been settled.     Mr. Lloyd George also refers to the figure of  20,000,000 mentioned in the House of Commons in May,  1930, as the maximum amount which it had been suggested might be spent on additional works if 100  per cent. grants were to be made. Since that figure was given, however, the total of  the Trunk Road and Five  Year Programmes has been increased by  9,500,000.  The  20,000,000 estimate was based on a &quot; probability &quot; of  100 per cent, grants, but some part of it may be absorbed in the  9,500,000 which has been added to the Trunk Road Programmes on a basis of grants of less tlian 100 per cent.
In addition, annual provisions are being made  for           further improvements so as to allow for a total    annual expenditure upon classified roads     ..   4,000,000    and upon unclassified roads    ..     ..     ..   2,000,000Finally, the Unemployment Grants Committee  has    during the last year authorised an expenditure    upon  unclassified roads (mainly in urban areas)    of some    ............   6,000,000   Since August, 1929, and up to 30th  September, 1930,  road schemes under  the  Trunk  Road  Programme,  Five  Years&apos;Programme and  Annual  Programme have been  approved forcommencement to an amount representing a total expenditure of 23 millions.   In addition, further schemes have been approved in principleduring  the  same  period  representing an expenditure  of   25millions, making in all  48 millions.  The figures include schemes approved  by  the  present  Government  but covered  by  theallocation for  improvements made in the original Road FundBudget for 1929-30 by the late Government.                    Scale of Expenditure.   2. While it is  broadly correct  to  state that  the  total ex-penditures envisaged in the Programmes  of the Government andof Mr. Lloyd George are of the same order of magnitude,  it mustbe remarked that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s figures of suggested  totalexpenditure which  reproduce  those of the 1929 pamphlet appearunwarrantably high in comparison with the  Government  Pro-gramme.  For example, for Trunk Roads he assumes a  generalwidth  of  metalled  carriage-way of 30 feet throughout Englandand  Wales and 20  feet in Scotland.  While we should approvesuch dimensions for the more  heavily trafficked sections of theroads, their immediate adoption on this wholesale scale would beunjustifiable  and  extravagant.  In  many  parts  of  the  open country a width of 20  feet is  fully adequate for present needs,and  wholesale widenings of carriage-ways to 30 feet would  addgreatly to  the  cost  of  future maintenance,  and be  widelycondemned by local and  public opinion  as extravagant.  Theywould greatly enhance capital cost, especially in the built-up areas.It is agreed that where  land is  purchased for new roads, the pur-chased width of land should allow for a width of 60 feet betweenfences.   3. Reference may also be made to the later paragraphs ofthis note,  as regards rural roads and weak bridges.       Suggested  Compression of  Government Programme.   4. The chief difference  between the proposals  of Mr.  LloydGeorge and  those of  the Government is in respect of the rate at which works can be put  in hand and completed  and in regardto the amount of labour to be afforded.   Mr. Lloyd George assumesa preliminary period  of four months  and  general completion ofhis programme in two years.   5. Mr. Lloyd  George is  understood  to have  been greatly influenced by a statement  that surface levels could be taken inflat country at the rate of a mile a day.  This, however,  cannotbe taken as  indicative in any way of the average time necessaryfor survey (often involving detailed  examination  of a  numberof alternative routes) and for technical work of preparing workingplans.   6. Mr. Lloyd  George is  correct in  pointing out  that highway authorities have  hesitated  to increase their staffs to deal withextra pressure. .  But  the  Ministry has urged  this course upon them, and the salaries are admitted for grant.  The appointmentof consulting engineers (whose fees also rank for grant) has been strongly  advocated by the Ministry,  and some authorities arenow showing greater willingness to follow this advice.
   7. Representations have, however, already been made to theMinistry by  responsible parties, that difficulties are being ex-ineperienced in recruiting sufficient expert staff to deal even with thepresent instalments  of  the Governments programme,  and Mr.Lloyd George&apos;s suggested speeding up would necessarily magnifythese difficulties.   8. Mr. Lloyd George suggests  (p. 65) that ah  the  necessarysurvey preliminaries have been completed for the Trunk and FiveYears&apos;  Programmes.  While every pressure  has  been  exertedupon Local Authorities, they have in many cases not yet found it  possible  to  complete surveys  for  major works  in these programmes.   9. Mr.  Lloyd  George  apparently  proposes  (p. 64)  thathighway authorities  should at once occupy any necessary land,including lands adjoining railway bridges, and leave questions ofcompensation to be settled after the  work is  done.   If localauthorities-who at  present often hesitate to offend importantowners  by  using compulsory purchase  powers were willing toadopt it, such a procedure could not fail to swell very severelythe compensation element in the cost of works.   10.  The  recent Public Works Facilities Act is designed to expedite the  preliminary negotiations, but it is clear that publicopinion in  this  country would  not tolerate unrestricted inter-ference  by highway authorities with the rights of  other  parties,who are in fact in many cases themselves statutory bodies.   11.  The Government has taken all possible steps to facilitateprocedure and to urge upon local authorities the need of energeticaction in the matter of preliminary  stages of works, but at theend  of September, 1930, local authorities had not yet been ableto produce the necessary details to admit of grant approval beingmade in respect of some  19 million of schemes under the trunk road and Five Year Programmes, for which  approval  had beengiven in principle.   12.  Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s suggested drastic  compression of theactual  period of execution of  the works would present  equallyserious  difficulties.   There would be grave dislocation  of road traffic if the reconstruction work proceeding at any time under thepresent programmes were multiplied many times over ;  and bothroad and rail transport of  vital importance  to  every form ofindustry (including that of road-making itself) would be greatlyimpeded if a  number of successive bridges on any one route were under construction at the same time.   13.  The remarks  above with regard to the limited  supply of technical staff for preparation  of plans apply with yet greaterforce to the  experienced staffs  that would  be required for the adequate supervision of the works themselves.   14.  While we are  urging and assisting highway authorities topress forward the execution of work with energy and expedition,there are limits to the  extent to which they can be persuaded orinduced to  accelerate their pace.  It cannot in the first place be overlooked that there is a large body of public opinion,  both inthe local government world and elsewhere, which questions the justification,  from  the  standpoint of national economics, of therate  at which large schemes of drastic reconstruction of roads arealready being put in hand.   It  may fairly  be represented thatunreasonable anticipations of  future needs not  merely lock upcapital, but also involve an unnecessary  annual burden of upkeepduring the anticipation  period.   15.  Mr. Lloyd George reminded the House of Commons on18th June,  1930  (Official  Report  col. 440)  that-&quot; the mereexpenditure of money upon things which are  not in themselvesproductive  will  not merely not solve the problem  but  willaggravate the problem.  The whole test of the expenditure ofmoney is whether you are going to spend it upon something which
is going to fructify  ...  I do not want to consider even roadsfrom the point of view merely of unemployment.  I simply want to consider them from the dominant principle of whether a roadis going to be helpful for the development of agriculture and ofindustry and of marketing.  If it is not,  if it is merely for thepurpose of enabling pleasure trips to be run and pleasure motoriststo be satisfied, for my part I would rule it out at once. The onlyreal test there is whether it is reproductive from a trade point ofview,  and if  it  is  not, then  I  should certainly deprecate theexpenditure of millions of money on roads ; . . . I hope it will beconsidered rather from the point of view of, to use the phrase ofthe Prime Minister, which  I think is a good phrase,  what are the reconditioning needs of  the country.&quot;    16. As Mr. Lloyd George recognises certain local authoritiesare unwilling and even  object at the  present time  to imposegreater burdens upon  the  ratepayers, and (p. 65)  he makesconcrete proposals for  further financial  inducements  to localauthorities, which have been carefully considered.  The induce-ments suggested, with  regard to future  and also to existing schemes,  are  a special bonus for works  completed  within  anabbreviated time limit  ;  and the grant of loans free of interest for works completed within two  years.    17. The first of these  expedients  involves some measure of&quot; speculation &quot;  on  the  part  of the local authority ;  but  owingto  its  constitutional position  a  local  authority is in a whollydifferent position from  an &quot; industrial  firm.&quot;  The whole experi-ence  of the Ministry  is  that local authorities dislike puttingworks in  hand except on  the firm basis of a definite  grant, andin spite of the fullest consideration given to the question, it has never  been possible to  enforce definite dates for commencementor completion of road schemes, with liability to grant reductionin case of failure.   Among other factors, special mention may bemade  of the inter-dependence  of authorities and of  the difficultyof obtaining possession of or access  to land.   The  absence offirm dates  for  &quot; normal  completion &quot;  would make  it difficultto  fix a date showing  sufficient acceleration to merit a bonus,and even if this could be done, the Ministry would be faced withappeals for concessions in  every case where the acceleration datewas overstepped by reason of alleged force majeure.  Where newroads  are constructed on  made ground or high banks, requiringtime for consolidation,  it would be injudicious to set  a premiumon  acceleration.    18. As to the measure  of additional &quot; inducement &quot; whichcould  be  offered, it must  be recalled  that the proportion  of thetotal cost of trunk road or five years&apos; schemes, now borne  by thelocal authority, is often only some 15 to  25 per cent. -    19. As to loans free   of  interest,  I have on more than one occasion  considered  this  possibility,  and  have taken  informalsteps  to ascertain whether proposals of this character would belikely to lead to any substantial increase  of activity on the partof  highway  authorities.   My information  tends  to  show  thatwhile  an offer of this  kind might appeal to  a few authorities,there  would  be  no general  response.   Many authorities arelooking forward with misgiving  to the higher  interest charges which they will have to bear during the later years of loans underschemes aided  by the Unemployment Grants Committee. I have,however,  already  brought before the  Treasury the suggestionthat the loan  free  of interest for a limited period might be  of practical value in those cases in which an authority has accepted a programme of work to be carried out by instalments.  Such an authority might be persuaded to put  the  later instalments of its programme in hand at once, on  the basis of  a free loan, whichwould put it in the same position,  from the standpoint of local rates, as if it had  carried out the work at the date originally arranged.
           Employment Aspect  of Liberal Proposals.    20. Mr. Lloyd George  adheres  to  his previous estimate that expenditure of  1,000,000 will provide 5,000 man-years of work. The estimate always used  for Road Fund purposes is  that each  1 million represents 2,000 direct labour with about a corresponding amount of indirect labour ; and recent experience tends to confirm the accuracy of the figure of 2,000.  It is interesting to note that in the case of a large scheme now in progress, the East Lancashire Road of  3,000,000, which is being pressed  on as vigorously as possible, the consulting engineers do not anticipate that it will be possible to employ more than 1,000 men at any one time on the site of the works.                     New  Arterial Roads.    21. Particular proposals of Mr. Lloyd George refer to suggested new arterial roads, unclassified (rural)  roads, and weak bridges.   22. The Trunk Road  and Five-Years&apos;  Programmes contain many proposals  based on precisely  the considerations set out in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Memorandum ;  but the construction of entirely new roads on 100  per  cent, grant basis  contemplated by Mr. Rees  Jeffreys would not merely involve  the supersession of existing highway authorities in  the areas concerned,  with the creation of a duplicate organisation under the central govern- ment, but it would also lead to the gravest dissatisfaction on the part of local  authorities who have  already  been persuaded to embark  on schemes of  magnitude   (including  important new highways and by-passes) on the basis of some  substantial con- tribution from local funds.   23. As to the  proposed routes themselves, it must be remem- bered that wholesale duplication of many miles of existing routes which have been recently brought  up to a high standard of construction could not be justified by any probable increase of traffic, even if we are to presume a deliberate policy of removing heavy traffic  from the radways.   24. To take the suggested London-Southampton  Road as an example,  the  Great West Road  extension  and the Bagshot By-Pass are already in use, and large By-Pass schemes are in hand for Basingstoke and Winchester, apart from  other widening and bridge works.  It  is  difficult to  conceive  that the  suggested additional road would be so &quot; reproductive from a trade point of view &quot; whether  or not it resulted  in  diverting heavy  traffic from  the railway or developing Hampshire  industrially as to justify in any way the expenditure involved.  In fact, however, the construction  of an entirely  new road between London and Southampton  for  heavy,  fast moving traffic could  not fail to divert traffic  from the Southern Railway and thus leave unpro- ductive  heavy capital expenditure which cannot be turned to other uses.   It is  often suggested that  no economic damage would be done if such a position occurred, because the country benefited  by  the development  of railways  at  the  expense of canals and the stage coach.  This  view overlooks some material differences in the circumstances.   The development of the railways was the competitive effort of private enterprise.  The development of the roads has been in part brought about by  expenditure out of local taxation in the form of rates and it has been accelerated as a result of  public  action since the war for the purpose of providing employment. No new development must be thwarted by the existence of vested interests, but as Minister of Transport I am bound  to  have regard  to  the  proper and  economicalutilisation of all available means of transport.   We must rely upon the railways for a long time to come to move the heavy basictraffics on which  our industries depend, but if, disregarding anyattempt to secure a proper distribution of  functions, we  were deliberately to  aim at  the transfer of  traffic from the rail to the
  road simply because we want to use the construction of roads as  relief works, the burden  of meeting rail expenditure must  fall  increasingly upon the heavy traffics such as coal, iron ore, iron,  steel, etc., or involve the worsening of railway workers&apos; conditions.                       Unclassified Roads.     25.  In the   1929  pamphlet  the   30  million  for  Rural  Unclassified) Roads (p. 112) represented                                                    million.       &quot; patch, tar spray and grit &quot; (twice) 55,000    21        miles of &quot; scheduled &quot; roads.       Other improvements   . .     . .     ..     ..      9                                                    30  In view of the criticism now made  that &quot; the action at present  contemplated  under the Government schemes consists mainly in  doing something to their  surface &quot;  it is relevant  to  note that  more than two-thirds of  the original  30 million  proposal was  for surfacing, which,  it   must be  remarked,  is  maintenance  work excluded from the Governments reconstruction programme  as a result of the Local Government  Act, 1929, which substitutes  &quot; block grants &quot;  for the grants hitherto made for this class of  work.   Moreover,  the figure  of  21,000,000 for  55,000  miles  appears to be based on the assumption of an average maintenance  cost for these  unclassified &quot; scheduled &quot; roads of   375 per mile ;  but  this is the  average  figure for  the comparatively  heavily  trafficked Class II roads, of which the width is greater and many  of which are in urban areas.     26. It is agreed  that a large mileage of the unclassified roads  in rural areas  is capable of improvement in width, gradient and  alignment, and that the standard of maintenance  is, in certain  areas, below what it should be.  The transfer of these roads to  the County Councils as from  1st  April last, should result in a  marked improvement in these respects.  Grants  of 50 per cent.  are made available for improvement works whether to line or  surface  and provision has been made for  1,000,000 grant under  that head during the current financial year.     27. Unless  the whole system of classification (a system univers-  ally commended)  is to go by the board, a sense of proportion must  be observed in dealing with expenditure on the various classes of  roads.  If the primary consideration is to find relief work on roads  in agricultural areas, then no doubt a good deal of work on these  unclassified roads might  be put in  hand.   If, however, traffic  considerations are such that a large expenditure for improvement  and  upkeep is justified on a  particular route, then that route  should be classified and dealt  with as such in pursuance of  the  Ministry&apos;s consistent policy.  There is  no  justification for an  initial expenditure of  21,000,000 ;  the tarring of an additional  50,000 miles of roads (many of them of insignificant value) twice  in one year is either impossible, or would result in such an increase  in the price of  tar  and  other  surfacing preparations as would  seriously affect the economics of road maintenance.  The indiscri-  terminate tarring of all lanes in dairying and cattle rearing counties  would not be welcomed ; in these districts foothold is preferred to  smoothness. Complaints are frequent that the interests of farmers  are subordinated to the interests of  motorists and that many of  the roads of the  country are impassable by horse transport and  stock.     28. It  must be  remembered  that the traffic on a very  large  proportion of these country lanes and roads is very light and that*  they are adequate  for all reasonable needs.  I am  sympathetic  to the policy  of improving rural roads with a view to assisting  agriculture and  have always been ready  to deal specially with  roads which carry a heavy agricultural traffic, e.g.,  timber, or beet.  But in general haulage loads from the farm are light and to a large  extent they are still horse-drawn, and the indiscriminate provision  of tarred  surfaces  would  probably  be a  definite  disservice  to  agriculture.
   29. The Ministry of Agriculture advises that it is a matter ofconsiderable  doubt  whether any schemes which  may,  in  thefuture, be put into effect under the Agricultural Marketing bill will  have any  appreciable  effect on the  volume  or  nature  ofagricultural traffic on rural roads.  It is not unlikely that organisa-tion would lead, as, for example, in the milk trade, to an increaseduse of the main roads by heavy traffic which would collect fromroadside dumps or packing  stations on classified roads  as theyfrequently do now.   Lorries should not travel a mile or  two upa country lane to collect butter and eggs from an individual farm.   30. It  is difficult to find  economic justification for facilitating the running  of charabancs over  all rural roads  as Mr. LloydGeorge seems to  contemplate.  The Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries  reports that there has been some complaint recentlyby farmers of the increasing use  of  second-class roads by largemotor coaches.   In England  and Wales there is already morethan  half  a mile  of classified  road to  every square  mile  of territory,  but classification is being steadily  pursued, and  theMinistry&apos;s policy is  to give Class  II  status, after reconstruction,to rural roads on which there is regular and heavy traffic.   A localauthority  benefits materially  if  an  unclassified road is raised to Class II status, since it henceforward earns a  50 per cent, grant for maintenance instead of that expenditure being covered by the block grant,  and  I  am ready to consider applications in respectof schemes for bringing  up to classification standard any ruralroads on which a regular heavy traffic is developing.                        Weak Bridges.   31. Mr. Lloyd George gives a  figure of   37  million for recon-struction of weak and dangerous bridges.  The 1929 pamphletsuggested that  10 million be spent in the first year and  27 million in the second year,  the expenditure to be borne primarily by theState. The Ministry agrees that a  heavy programme of recon-structing weak bridges is one of the most fruitful directions inwhich money could  be spent.  The  Ministry has lost no oppor-tunity of urging this policy upon  all local authorities with strongemphasis  during  the past 12 months.   Grants of 75 per cent.are  available.  The response  has been disappointing, although many authorities are now  submitting substantial programmes,and  recent legislation (Public Works Facilities Act,  1930) will help to overcome the difficulties of obtaining easements acrossrailways and canals.   32. Mr. Lloyd George apparently misreads page  50 of  theRoad Fund Report of 1928-29, in stating  that 135 bridges were dealt with in that year ;  the total number (as shown on page 17)of the Report  was 408.   Normally, about 400 bridges of alldimensions are reconstructed annually with assistance from theRoad Fund, and it is a condition of grant that each bridge shouldbe capable of bearing the Ministry&apos;s standard  load.   During thenext five years the number dealt with annually will be materiallyincreased,  by  reason of  the Trunk  Road  and  Five Years&apos;Programmes. Weak bridges in those sections of Trunk Roads whichare dealt with will  be reconstructed as part of the work, whilst the Ministry&apos;s Divisional Road Engineers are using  their bestefforts to induce local authorities to  take wider advantage of theterms offered.  Special representations were made on behalf ofthe Minister  to local authorities in the Black  Country to directtheir  energies to this matter, and it is understood that many ofthese local authorities have given instructions  for schemes to beprepared.   33. The number  of bridges demanding radical reconstruction in the near future should, however, not be exaggerated ; someof the roads on which these bridges  exist carry little traffic, andit would be an extravagant policy to say  that every road mustbe altered to take any vehicles of whatever weight.  As regardsthe rate of expenditure, it must be borne in mind that many ofthese bridges present difficult engineering problems, and that itis not possible to have under repair at the same time successivebridges  on important lines of railway, since  otherwise  railway
traffic would be seriously affected.  Regard must also be had tothe intense dislocation of traffic by road if anything approaching thenumber  of  bridges envisaged  were  under  reconstruction atthe same time.   It may be added, that few cases in which weakbridges on the minor roads have been represented to be a serioushindrance to the efficient  handling of  agricultural traffic havebeen brought to the attention of the Ministry.                       Level Crossings.   34. Mr. Lloyd George makes  a passing reference to the urgent need  of replacing large  numbers  of level crossings by bridges.Of some  1,400 level crossings on classified roads, about one-thirdare on light railways  or private lines ;  and of  the remainder,many are in large towns  or built-up areas, where the cost  of substituting a bridge would be very heavy indeed, and the workvery protracted.  In other cases they are on roads across whichthe railway traffic is so light that the inconvenience to road usersby the closing  of gates is almost negligible.   35. The  offer made in  March last to highway authorities  ofa 75 per cent,  giant towards works affecting the elimination  oflevel crossings has, so far, evoked little response, but it is possiblethat this hesitation is due, not to  failure to appreciate the necessityof  taking  action,  but to  difficulties with  railway and  canalcompanies, which will be eased by the recent Act.                         Site Values.   36. I entirely agree that all possible  steps should be  takento secure that some  part  of the cost  of public improvementsshould be met out of the increased value  of properties  due  tothe improvements.  In the particular case of the North OrbitalRoad I have, with the advice of  the  Chief  Valuer, taken steps for the purchase of surplus lands  with a view to recoupment ;and the question of  frontagers&apos; contributions is one to whichconsiderable attention is given by my Department in every caseof road improvement or road construction.  In the case of roadsconstructed or improved under  certain Acts the  increased valueof adjoining lands of the same  owner can be set off against thecompensation otherwise  payable.   This method has been exten-sively employed in connection with road schemes in which theMinistry of Transport is  interested and the cost of acquiring landfor the roads has been materially reduced (in some few cases tonil) by taking the benefit  conferred on the adjoining lands intoaccount in assessing the  purchase price or compensation payable.    37. The questions raised in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s memorandum are matters of general Government policy  rather than the par-ticular concern of my Department, but I may mention that theMinister of Transport supported  the Middlesex  County council when they sought Parliamentary powers to enable them to purchaseland  for  recoupment  in road construction  schemes ;  I  should look sympathetically on similar applications which might be putforward by other Highway Authorities, and my Department hasalready suggested that a similar  express power might be conferred on highwa5^ authorities generally.    38.  It is not entirely clear how far Mr. Lloyd George proposes that  recoupment should  be  obtained  by  the  Government (or local authorities) themselves entering into the business of landspeculation or how far he contemplates a return in the form oftaxation of enhanced  values.   It may be remembered that thegreater the degree of acceleration in road construction  the more remote is likely to be the  development of the frontages and thepossibility of recoupment.  New roads in open country, such asthose proposed by Mr. Rees Jeffreys may (e.g., owing to severanceof  estates)  depreciate rather than appreciate the value of the lands through which they pass.  Moreover, it must be rememberedthat  a great part of the  expenditure proposed by Mr.  Lloyd George such as that on the reconstruction of weak bridges andtarring  of  rural roads  would  give  but little  opportunity forrecoupment.
   39. In connection with Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s remarks as to theparticular case of the Kingston By-Pass land, the Chief Valuerhas informed me :         &quot; There was no land purchased at  1,250 per acre which    was only worth  300 per acre before the road was thought    of.  On the Merton  connection, to which this statement is    specifically applied, the total cost did not average any such    sum,  and the total cost included,  inter alia, a house worth    some   3,000, occupying about one-third of an acre, and lands    devoted to public playing fields where the interference caused    by severing part of the land for the construction of the road    caused considerable damage.&quot;   40. The lands selling  at  1,800 and  600 are identified in  the1929 Pamphlet, and as to these the Chief Valuer states :         &quot; The building sites which are being sold are not upon the    frontage of the arterial road,  but  upon another estate road    laid out  as part of a scheme  of  development  before  the    arterial road was projected.  The  sale of these plots is part    of the normal process of development of  the estate  and  has    no direct relation to tne construction of the arterial road.&quot;            SECTION  2 REGIONAL PLANNING.   41. The proposals in this section assume that there are many (Note by the approved regional plans for works which could be started at an ^^S^\ of early date  and that it would be of  national advantage if theState embarked, with a special organisation,  on a large scale onthe development  of garden cities, satellite towns and the like.These assumptions do not accord with the realities of the presentsituation.   42. It is well  to explain at the outset that planning schemesdo not themselves provide for the carrying out of public works.They set out the considered framework within  which development,private and public,  is to proceed so as to ensure the best interestsof the community.  A good plan must look ahead, at least 50 years.Public works are intended to be carried out by the Local Authoritiesin the ordinary course of their duties, when the time is opportuneor,  as at present, when a special emergency justifies acceleration.Thus,  roads (which are usually the  principal public works forwhich express provision is made in  schemes) are carried out aspart of the road programme, with grants from  the Ministry ofTransport where  warranted.   A great deal of work specially putin  hand for relieving unemployment has been  done accordingto planning proposals.   One advantage of a  definite plan is thatit facilitates a considered programme of works.    43. Regional  planning  is  comparatively  new.   Only  oneregional  scheme  has  yet  been  submitted  to my  department for approval.  In a number of cases regional  proposals have been incorporated in town  (as distinct from regional) planning schemesor  in  Preliminary  Statements  (outline  proposals preliminary tothe final scheme, but  effective  for controUing  development) andin other instances works have been carried out in anticipation ofa scheme ;  but there is no ground for saying that  150,000 men could be employed within a year on  approved regional proposals. It  will, of  course,  be appreciated that care must  be taken toavoid counting twice the employment contribution  of the con-siderable volume of work which, as is indicated above,  is carriedout in accordance with regional planning  proposals,  but as apart of a road, housing or other programme.    44. The writers may have in mind the reports which have been issued by  Regional Committees.  But these  reports  are advisory only ; they are far from completed  plans, just as a  sketch is far from being the completed picture ; proposals have usually to be far more definite, many negotiations have to be carried out and ways and  means fully considered before  a final  plan can be put forward.
   The Government not only concur in the importance of regional planning, but are actively pressing it. The Regional committees have usually been initiated  by my Department.  Most of  the mare still advisory, but there are in all 36 Joint Committees whichare executive, with full powers to prepare operative plans, and every effort should be and will be made to increase that number.                        Garden Cities.   45. The Government would not hesitate to place proposals before Parliament if satisfied that the national interests would be served by  embarking on  a  large scheme for developing gardencities.  It  appears to the  Government,  however,  that such  apolicy cannot possibly be  justified at the present time.   46. It  is no use  establishing  garden cities unless there is reasonable  assurance that industries will be attracted to them insufficient number, for it is the essence of a garden city that mostof those who live in it also work in it.  There is no present ground for assuming  that industries  could be  attracted  in sufficient number to new garden  city  sites,  and  the inducement  hasbeen  reduced  by the  derating provisions  of last year.   Theexperience  of   Welwyn illustrates  the  difficulties  of securingthe  establishment  of  industries.    The  Government  warmlyadmire the achievements at  Letchworth  and Welwyn (both ofwhich, of  course,  are also  partly  dormitory towns)  and  they hope that  their example  will be copied (there are  already somepowers in  the  Town  Planning Act for aiding the establishmentof garden  cities).   It has,  however, to be recognised that the developments at these two  garden cities in the way of industryand housing under improved conditions are but a small fraction ofthat which has taken place  in recent years.   47. The question of  the location of industries has to be muchmore thoroughly considered before any large extension of gardencities can  be expected, and that  question may be  worthy of aspecial enquiry.  No greater disservice could be rendered to thecause  of garden cities and  of regional planning, which it  is so important  to foster, than to bring them into discredit by under-taking costly  developments without reasonable prospect thatthey will be used.   48. The measure in which the costs of establishing a gardencity or the like may be met out of increments in  the value ofland will depend, of course,  upon the success of the  venture.                       Satellite Towns.   49. I  join   in  the  desire for establishing satellite  towns,self-contained  and  not  just  prolongations of existing towns,and I hope that one  result  of  regional planning  will  be toencourage   Local Authorities  to undertake such  settlements.The  policy of the  Government has  been  to rely on  LocalAuthorities for the public provision of houses, aided by liberalgrants ;  and  there  is  no case for  departing from  this policy,especially at a time when  the new Housing Act is just coming intooperation,   with enhanced  Exchequer  assistance  and  special reference   to   slum   clearance  and  improvement  of  housing conditions.    50. Hitherto Local Authorities, acting in  consonance with theviews of  their  constituents, have  usually placed  their housingschemes within or near to their own district and, however muchone may  regret that more experiment has not been made  insatellite  towns, it cannot be gainsaid  that  these schemes have provided  excellent accommodation with  general  amenities  farsurpassing pre-war conditions.    51. The establishment of satellite towns is not generally a means for  rehousing persons displaced by slum clearances.  these persons usually cannot afford the combined rent and travelling expenses  (however much it might be practicable to reduce thelatter) and often do not desire to live far away from their work ;to do so would be highly inconvenient for many of them  under
present conditions.  Indeed, one  of the  difficulties now is the pressure brought to bear on Local Authorities and on my Depart-ment to allow rehousing on the cleared site when this is  not inthe general interest, or a larger amount of rehousing on the sitethan seems desirable.  The extension of planning powers to alreadydeveloped areas,  a much-needed reform which the Governmenthave in mind, will help to deal with this problem, among others.   52. Three other  matters need  to be borne in mind (a)  for providing additional employment  (which  is the more immediateconcern) it  matters little  whether the housing is provided oncleared areas within a town, in garden suburbs on its fringe, orin satellite towns  (though, of course, there are other considerations which may make one form better than another) ;  (b) it is likely that Local Authorities will slacken their activities if the Govern-ment intervenes with schemes of its own ; and (c) the net result might well be to  reduce the total  amount of work in hand at anearly date, and it is now,  and during the coming winter, whenunemployment is so high  because of  world conditions, that asmuch additional employment as possible should be given.   53. It will be  apparent  from what has  been above stated thatno case is seen  for the establishment of special central machinery in relation to  these matters.  The  responsibility in respect  ofthem has been placed on the Local Authorities, and it would seem that the sensible  Course is not to impair or confuse that responsi-bility but to intensify the  efforts which have been and are beingincreasingly made to assist Local Authorities and to expand their activities.                          Site Values.   54. The  Government heartily  agree that part of the  cost ofpublic improvements should be met out  of the increased valueof properties due to the improvements.   Local Authorities already have certain powers.  Thus, in the case of a  new road, frontageland may be purchased as  weU as the  land required for the roaditself (though it would be  a mistake to think that it will alwayspay to do this).  Betterment may be claimed where the value ofproperty is increased by the provisions  of a town planning scheme,but  at present only to one-half  the  amount.  Increase  of this proportion is under consideration in relation  to the forthcomingamending legislation on town planning.    55.  In practice, betterment is not easy to obtain,  and  theprincipal  advantage of the present  power  is as  a  weapon ofbargaining.   The Government consider that there should be more direct powers to enable Local Authorities to levy a fair part ofthe cost of a public improvement on properties which can be shown to  be benefited,  and they have  it in mind in  their planninglegislation to include  proposals for this  purpose as  well as to enlarge the  powers of Local Authorities to control frontagedevelopment.                 Scottish Regional Development.    56. I concur generally in the Minister of Health&apos;s Memorandum  (Note by theon  these subjects.   So far as  Scotland is  concerned the Minister  f^fo1? 0fof Health&apos;s arguments apply with even greater force because :    Scotland.)        (1) Regional Planning Schemes in Scotland are even  less     advanced than in England.        (2) In  Scotland the rehousing  of  slum tenants  is seldom     undertaken  on the cleared site.  The appended notes deal     with these two special points.    57. Regional  planning in Scotland is still in a very early stage of progress.   Only  two regional  planning  maps  have yet beenprepared.  These are very tentative in their nature, and, so far,deal only with the question of future  roads and  road  widenings.These roads are designed to provide adequate  and convenientsystems of through communication in the areas to which theyrefer, and it  is  intended that they  should  be  constructed as occasion  arises  in  the normal   course  of  development.  The
           establishment of new centres of population and the allocation of           definite areas  for  different  types of development has not yet           been considered, and regional schemes in Scotland could, therefore,           supply no data which would be of use to the suggested Development           Board  in considering  the  question  of undertaking immediate           works to assist the growth of new residential or industrial areas.              58.  With regard to the  effect of rehousing schemes  on the           congested areas in  towns, it should be made clear that it is only           in exceptional  cases  that  displaced tenants  in  Scottish  slum           clearance schemes  are rehoused on the cleared site.   These sites           are usually utilised as open spaces (thereby ventilating the  area)           or for business purposes.  Displaced tenants are generally rehoused           away from the slum areas on virgin sites, laid out so as to provide           adequate fresh air, gardens and open spaces.  Edinburgh&apos;s latest           rehousing scheme,  for instance, involving 1,600 houses, is being           carried out on a site some four miles from the centre of the city.           Scottish Local Authorities do not, as a rule, have any difficulty           in finding open and healthy sites within their own administrative           area, and they  could  not  be induced to build houses in new           centres of population  outside  their  own  area,  unless  very           exceptional financial inducement was provided.                     SECTION 3.-TELEPHONE DEVELOPMENT.(Note by the    59.  The original telephone programme in the pamphlet  &quot; WePostmaster- can conquer unemployment &quot; assumed an expansion of 300,000General.)    telephones per annum for a period of five years as  compared with           the current rate of increase of 125,000;  on this  basis it was           estimated that capital expenditure of some  50,000,000 would be           required during the five years over and above the  present capital           programmes ( 10,000,000 a year),  and that employment would           thereby  be provided for 60,000 persons.  Various  calculations           were included  in  the  pamphlet purporting  to show that this           expenditure would be a sound investment  and,  indeed, would           yield a profit.                       Expansion of Construction Programme.              60.  In the revised Liberal proposals a net increase of 300,000           telephones per annum is still assumed to be obtainable and  is           relied  upon in  the concluding  summary  to give  employment           to the same number of  men, i.e.,  60,000.  No further mention           is made of the finance of the scheme except  the somewhat           significant remark (page 103) that &quot; telephone development will           over a  sufficient period be on a self supporting basis.&quot;              61.  It has  been pointed out by  the Post Office in previous           memoranda that the telephone system supplemented by annual           programmes on the existing scale is  not only sufficient both for           present requirements  and for development on the scale realised           in recent years, i.e.,  125,000 additional  telephones  per annum,           but there is in fact a substantial margin of plant in situ which           would  suffice  to carry a considerably larger annual intake  of           new  subscribers.   For  example,  if the annual increase  were           to rise  from 125,000 to 150,000, it would be at least two years before           any appreciable addition in capital expenditure would be necessary.           The  Liberal  representatives do not  apparently  contest  this           conclusion but. argue that                    (1) by  improved salesmanship the annual intake  could               be brought up from  125,000 to 300,000 per annum ;                   (2) that a vast  programme of construction should be               immediately put  in  hand in the hope that this expectation               will be realised.              62. To take the second point first, it is obviously the primary           duty  of every  telephone  administration to provide  sufficient           plant to enable new orders  to be executed without  delay, but it           is.also their aim to keep the margin of  spare plant as small  as           possible consistently  with  ability  to  provide service.   The
premature construction of plant which  would remain  idle andtherefore  non-revenue earning imposes a serious burden on thefinance of the service  and must ultimately lead to increased charges to the users or, alternatively, to the postponement  of reductions which would otherwise  be   possible.   The  policypursued by the Post Office and by all modern telephone adminis-trations is to base its  construction programmes  upon detailedsurveys of each individual exchange area.  On the basis of thesesurveys forecasts of the  prospective requirements  for  some20 years ahead are prepared and periodically corrected, and theprovision  of plant is regulated according to the local requirements as indicated by the most recent forecasts.   63. No evidence has been submitted in the Liberal Memorandaor by Liberal representatives in  support of their  contention that an increase of 300,000 subscribers per annum is practicable.It appears to be a  purely conjectural  figure based upon therealised development in certain foreign countries where conditionsare in many respects entirely different.   No commercial under-taking  would  embark upon enormous capital  commitmentswithout a detailed and scientific examination of the possibilitiesof development, and there is in fact a considerable quantity  ofdata  in existence which indicate that  expansion on  anything approaching this scale is at present  unobtainable.   64. If  a construction programme of the magnitude suggestedwere put  in hand and the optimistic forecasts of  demand  failedto materialise, the results would be  disastrous.  The telephone service would be saddled with capital charges for interest and depreciation on plant which would be lying idle of some  5,000,000per annum which would have to be met either by the tax-payer or,more probably, by the telephone user in the form of an increasedtariff a consequence which would in itself tend to restrict theservice and to strangle further  development.  Moreover,  while a programme of these dimensions would obviously give an immensefillip to industries depending directly or indirectly on telephoneorders, production cannot permanently outrun demand, and if thedemand fell seriously short of expectations, construction wouldhave  to be stopped at the conclusion of  the five-year period,  ormore probably, before.  The disorganisation and hardship in theindustries affected can easily be imagined  if an annual expenditureof about  20,000,000 were suddenly terminated ;  the Governmentwould be open to the accusation of having induced a severe slump in the train of an artificially produced boom.   65. As regards the possibdities of securing an immediate andspectacular expansion in telephone development, the  followingfacts should be borne in mind :         (a) In order to maintain a net annual increase of 125,000    telephones, it is at present necessary to secure some 265,000    new orders per annum, i.e.,  140,000 telephones are for one    reason or another surrendered.   To maintain a  net annual    increase of 300,000 telephones, about 700,000 new orders per    annum would be required.        (b) Practically all  business houses  and  most  private    residences of any appreciable size are already equipped and    the field of development is therefore in the main limited to the    smaller shops  and houses,  etc.   As the telephone service    extends among a lower stratum of the population to whom its    value is limited, the ratio of cessations must be expected  to    increase.  This factor has in fact already been making itself    felt in recent  years.        (c) During times of industrial stagnation the telephone is    often one of the first items selected for retrenchment, and  in    the past year it has been found that in areas  suffering most    from unemployment the cessations practically balance the new    orders obtained.  The present  industrial depression is  a    particularly unfavourable time to expect an unprecedented    increase in business, however active the canvassing organisa-    tion may be.
       (d) The development  of the telephone service in foreign    countries varies widely.  In North America and the Scandinavian-    scandinavian States the telephone habit has grown much faster    than in the rest of Europe, but there are many countries, such    as France, Belgium, and Holland, where the development is of    slower growth  than  in Great Britain.  Even in Germany,    where  the  development  figures are  fairly  high,  the net    expansion in 1928 (the last year for which figures are available)    was only 135,000, while in France it did not  exceed 82,000.    Apart  from the  United  States, the  experience of foreign    countries  gives no  support to the suggestion  that  a net    increase of 300,000 per annum in Great Britain is practicable.                     Sales Organisation.   66. The Liberal  proposals obviously depend upon the resultsof the more elaborate sales  organisation which  they advocate.The Post  Office organisation, which is  criticised  as inadequate,relies  mainly upon  personal canvassing by a body of about 650full-time officers distributed throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The efforts of these canvassers are supplemented by the exhibition of posters and the distribution  of  leaflets, etc.The total cost comes to about  250,000 per annum, representingapproximately a cost of  1 for each new order obtained.   67. The policy which the telephone service should pursue is described  in  the Liberal  Memorandum  as &quot;to persuade thegreatest possible number  of  persons  to  instal telephones andto persuade them to make the fullest possible use of them, andby adopting  the most  efficient  methods to  facilitate  the saleof telephones by rendering the service as perfect as possible andsupplying it at the lowest possible rate.&quot;  As  a broad statementof policy this would probably secure  universal assent. But thereare material  differences  between the  sale of telephone serviceand  the sale  of an  ordinary commodity.   The vendor of a commodity usually derives a profit  from each article sold and,what  is still more important, by increasing his turnover he cancut down the cost of production and, in particular, the overheadcharges.  For this reason it pays him well to spend large sums onadvertising his wares, more especially when he is in competition with other producers.  The telephone service,  on the other hand,is run on a bare margin of profit and, speaking generally, expansiondoes not carry with  it a reduction in costs ; in fact, the experienceof the United States, where development  is highest,  indicates that as the system extends the cost of providing service tends toincrease, and it is for this  reason that  the American tariffs havehad to be raised on more than one occasion in recent years.   it follows that the amount  that can be wisely spent on advertisingand salesmanship is limited and requires to be closely  watched.Advertising expenditure is a direct  charge against  the revenue of the undertaking and  is not  recoverable by savings in costsattributable to it.   68. Mention is made in the  Liberal Memorandum of certainexperiments of  intensive canvassing which yielded  a net resultof 200 lines over the normal growth at a cost of the equivalent of four men&apos;s  work for  one year.   The Memorandum  observesthat this represents an increase in business of 125 per cent., butit omits to point out that  the cost of obtaining these additionallines would be somewhere  about   7 per line, or more than equalto a whole year&apos;s rental.   To obtain a  gross increase of 700,000telephones per annum  would  at  this rate entail  an annual expenditure  upon  canvassing  and  publicity  of  an  entirelyprohibitive figure.   69. The Post Office publicity staff has,  in fa*ct, been largely increased in recent years and is now some 50 per cent, larger thanit was three years  ago.   At any one  time  the canvassers haverecords of some 500,000 unsuccessful interviews  upon theirbooks, and it is believed that the field is fairly well covered.  But
it is the regular practice to experiment in selected areas either byintensive  canvassing or  by  various forms  of publicity andadvertisement, and to adopt for more general application thosewhich  yield the  most successful results.  Opinions  may differas to the amount which can usefully be expended on advertising,but it seems  certain that  any expenditure  which the  servicecould carry would  not  produce the startling results which theLiberal proposals visualise.   On  the other hand,  there is nodoubt  much to be  said for the policy of  devoting any surplus which may be available to the reduction of charges made to thepublic which is certainly the most promising means of attractinga larger clientele.                   New Public Corporation.   70. The Liberal Programme concludes  with a proposal thatthe telephone service should be divorced  from the Post Officeorganisation and while remaining, under the control of the Post-master General should, be given an independent position somewhat similar to that occupied by the Central Electricity  Board or theB.B.C.  The scheme is not developed in any detail and it is notvery clear what  the  authors have in mind.   It is  apparentlycontemplated  that the Postmaster General  should continue to be directly responsible for the remaining Post Office  services, butthat as regards the telephones he would not encroach upon theindependence of whatever body was placed in immediate charge.In view of the importance of the telephone service in the  systemof national communications, it seems questionable whether eitherParliament or  the public would acquiesce in its being, for practical purposes, removed from Parliamentary control, or  would foregothe right of ventilating their grievances in the House of Commons.The Postmaster General would either have  to occupy the positionof being merely the mouthpiece of the Corporation  responsiblefor the service, or if he took any active part in administration, hewould be open to the charge of fettering the discretion of  a body which  was intended to be independent.    The telephone  serviceemploys a large staff and it is extremely  improbable that theywould forego the right of appeal to  the responsible Minister.   71. It  is not clear why the telephones  should be selected forspecial treatment, while the postal, telegraph  and other servicesadministered by  the  Department are to be left as they stand.The  postal  and  telegraph services present equally difficult andin some respects cognate problems of administration, and  from anational point of  view they are of no less importance.  Moreover,the practical difficulties of separation would be immense. To takeonly one example, the telegraph and telephone wires are  carriedon the same poles and in  the same  underground cables and their maintenance and construction must obviously be in the hands of asingle  engineering organisation.  If the telephone service  were transferred to an independent body, it would probably be foundinevitable that the telegraph service should  go with it.   This againwould involve further difficulties.    The  telegraph  and  postal services are worked, in  all except the largest  towns, to a largeextent by a common staff; to create a separate telegraph staff would entail heavy increase of cost;  to maintain  a compactstaff throughout the country working under two separate adminis-trative organisations would mean that each man would be  servingtwo  masters  and that one  or other administration would  be deprived of one  of its  most essential functions the control ofits own employees.  Finally, even if the services were administra-tively  distinct they would necessarily have to function in closecorrelation with each other and would have points of contact andpossibly friction  all over  the country.   The  only  co-ordinatingauthority would be the Postmaster General himself, whose position vis-d-vis the independent  authority would  be,a delicate one and whose Parliamentary and political duties  would, in any event,leave him insufficient time to  assume the duties  of a general manager.
                    SECTION 4-ELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT.(Note by the    72. In general the Electricity Commissioners, whom I haveMinister of  consulted and with whose views I  concur, agree with the view ranspor .)  ^n^.  forwar(j that a  more comprehensive  and  vigorous  selling           policy by the undertakers is required.  While there are certain           minor points in the Memorandum  on  which the Commissioners           might offer criticism, they only consider it necessary to call           attention to the following major points.              73. As to the &quot; recent achievements of the Commission and           Board &quot;  it may be remarked that the original Liberal proposals           under-estimated  the  amount  that  was actually being spent on           distribution, assuming that it  was only about  6,000,000 per           annum,  and suggested an acceleration of  12,000,000 a year,           giving a total of  18,000,000;  whereas the figure for the year           ending March  31st,  1929, was   17,000,000, and from an ex-           amination  of about  half the returns  of  authorised undertakers           it is reasonable to assume that  the same total  was  reached for           the year ending 31st March, 1930.              74. In  a circular  which the Commissioners  sent out  at my           request on  the  15th  November, 1929, they estimated  that over            100,000,000 would be spent on transmission  and  distribution           systems  in the next 5 years, that is, an average expenditure  of            20,000,000 a year ; and added that in their opinion a considerable           percentage  of this could be accelerated so as to fall within the           next 2 years without throwing any unreasonable burden  on the           industry.   They see  no reason  to  alter the opinion  expressed a           year ago and on this basis they  are of opinion that the industry           can  reasonably spend at least  another   3,000,000 under those           heads and probably considerably more in  addition  to the            17,000,000 which they spent last year.                     Control of Retailer.   75. With regard to the &quot; Control of the  Retailer &quot; while it istrue that the  Commissioners  have in practice  little  effective means of inducing established undertakings to embark  on a progressive policy of  capital  development, they have powersrequiring some of the new large undertakings operating overwide areas to submit proposals  of development to them fromtime to time  and a  note of the proposals recently  approvedis appended.   (Appendix III.)                           Tariffs.   76. The Report of the recent Committee on Tariffs, appointedby the  Commissioners, recommends  that all supply  authoritiesshould have pressed upon them the advantages of a &quot; two-part &quot;tariff.  This principle  has been adopted by the  Commissioners,who  have pressed and are  continuing to press,  undertakers  toadopt a tariff of  this nature where one is not already  in force.The  Committee further  report that  of  the several forms  oftwo-part tariff in force a particular one should be recommended for universal use.  This recommendation does not carry with itthe unanimous support of the progressive part of the  industryand the Commissioners consider that further technical examinationwill  be necessary before  they can urge undertakers to change the two-part tariffs already in existence to the particular systemrecommended by the Committee. This does not, however, interferewith their general policy of pressing upon every  undertaker theadoption of some two-part tariff where one does not exist.                       Assisted Wiling.   77. The Commissioners in their circular letter already referredto urged the adoption by undertakers of assisted wiring and ofextended facilities for hire and  hire purchase of  apparatus.They have also sent copies of the Report of the Committee to every authorised  undertaker.
79tj   78. The Commissioners have great difficulty in making any&quot; estimate of the capital  expenditure possible as the  result ofvigorous propaganda &quot; ;  they do not  think any value  can beattached to an  estimate  derived  from an average of  10,000per annum for each of 650 undertakers.   So far as the information is available it would appear that only a few of the larger under-takers spend  10,000 a year or more in this manner, and, owingto the great difference in size and  circumstance of undertakers,they doubt if this basis affords any criterion.  If an estimate isnecessary they desire to point out that their statistical returnshows that in the year ending 31st March,  1929, the number of&quot; connections&quot;  was increased by  394,000 (from 2,599,000 to2,993,000).  It may be assumed that not more than 300,000 ofthese are within the ambit  of possible hire purchase schemesfor apparatus.   The present rate  of  increase (15 per cent.) inconnections each year is so high that the most vigorous  campaigncan hardly be expected to raise the annual increase by more than25 per cent., which  would require an extra  100,000 connections.If the average expenditure on these were taken at  15, which isprobably too high, the additional expenditure would still be only amillion and a half ( 1,500,000).  Without wishing in any way todecry the importance of a selling campaign or  to  minimise its possible  results,  the Commissioners must regard the  estimateof  6,500,000 per annum additional expenditure as excessive.                       Rural Supplies.   79. With regard to  rural supplies, the  inference to  be  drawn from  the Liberal Memorandum is  that  it  is necessary to wait for the results of the experiments  in Bedford, Aylesbury, etc.,before  pressing on with rural supplies.  The Commissioners donot concur in this view and are doing everything in their powerto stimulate other  proposals.  In view, however, of the  lengthof time involved in any negotiations they would not  anticipate any great contribution to employment  from this source in  thenext year.   80. The  undertakers  have  so  frequently  been  asked  byMinisterial appeals,  both general and directed particularly to  the electrical industry,  to take any steps they can to increase the  useof electricity with a view to reduction of unemployment, that  theCommissioners doubt whether any  further  appeal by  way of ageneral conference  would meet  with any adequate  response.In the circular to which they have already referred issued by them,the  Commissioners urged  on authorities the points made in  theLiberal proposals and have set out clearly the financial inducementsoffered through  the machinery of the Development Act,  1929.I will take any occasion that  offers of personally  addressingundertakers as to these points;  and the  Commissioners assureme  that they will  themselves take every opportunity in theirnumerous conferences  with  individual undertakers, or in anymeetings or conferences which are addressed by the Commissioners,to press the same policy.   It must  be recalled that the Ministerand  the  Commissioners are not directly managing the industryand  can only urge  undertakers ;  but the Commissioners haveevidence that the appeals which I have made from time to timein various speeches have had considerable practical results and they suggest that I should take, as I intend to do, any further oppor-tunity that offers to exhort  the undertakers to  increase theirselling activities.  They believe  that this method will in factproduce greater practical results than a special conference.          SECTION 5. DOCKS AND  HARBOURS.   81. There is no difference  of view between the Government jj^0vetbyt &apos;and Mr. Lloyd George as to the importance of improvement of xransport)docks and harbours.  Since taking office, the Government havegiven proof of their concern in this matter, by approving grants under the Development Act, 1929, towards dock schemes involvingexpenditure of well over   10 millions, and the offer of assistance under that Act still remains open.
   82. The fullest consideration has been given on behalf of theGovernment to the report of the Port Facilities Committee, andthe Minister  of  Transport  has taken steps to secure  that therecommendations of the Port Facilities Committee&apos;s Report havebeen brought before the notice of all the dock authorities concerned,with full information as to the  assistance which can be offered bythe Government  under the  Development Act.   83. In connection with dock schemes generally, it is important to bear in mind that local interests at almost every port of anyconsequence are  wont to urge the desirability of a large dockscheme which would attract greater traffic,  ocean-going or coast-wise.  It  is, however, not possible to find economic justificationfrom the national standpoint  for  large  expenditure on theprovision  of facilities at one  port,  if the result is merely to be the diversion  of trade from another competitive port which can nowhandle adequately the existing and potential traffic.  It may beremarked that Labour interests at Liverpool have made  repre-sentations that substantial Government assistance to  other docksmight have grave reactions upon Liverpool.   84. The railway groups created by the Railways Act of 1921,in several cases found they had to take over docks which, under asystem of unrestricted competition, provided in certain areas an aggregate accommodation in excess of any possible traffic demandsthat could be  foreseen ;  and it is obviously sound policy to con-concentrate effort upon the improvement of facilities at the  pointsmost favourable geographically for particular classes  of traffic.   85. Mr. Lloyd George cites certain major schemes  on whichthe Port Facilities Committee&apos;s Report of 1929 laid stress :         New  Dock at  Middlesbrough.- The  Ministry has been in     communication  with the Chamber of Shipping and the     Railway Company with regard to this important matter, and     alternative schemes  for a  new dock or  for deep water berths     are under discussion between representatives  of the Railway     Company and a Committee of Shipowners.  Two  other     statutory authorities  besides the   Railway  Company are     concerned.        Improvement  of Approaches  to  London  Docks. The     expenditure  of  over  \\ million sanctioned by the  late     Government on the Victoria Dock Road has been put in hand,     and nearly 1,000 men are at  work mainly on the re-housing     schemes which are an essential preliminary to the road work     proper, and  must inevitably be taken  in successive  stages     At the instance  of  the Minister of  Transport,  the London     County  Council  are now examining   a  number of  other     schemes  for improvement  of road access to the London     Docks.        Completion  of King George  Dock,   Hull,  and  Necessary     Equipment. The London   and North  Eastern  Railway     Company have proposed  a scheme costing over   \\ million,     and  the  Government  have  made  a  provisional offer of     substantial assistance, but in their present financial position,     the Company are likely to give priority-to other major works     which they deem more urgent.        West  Hartlepool  New  Dock. The Ministry can trace no     representations with regard to this scheme, other than those     in the Port Facilities Report,  which states that  &quot; local     opinion is strongly  in  favour of the construction of  a new     deep water  dock  on the  Slake site.&quot;   The docks  belong to     the  London and North  Eastern Railway,  who  as  noted     above,  presumably  give  a  higher  priority  to  other more     urgent schemes.    86. As regards the  smaller  ports,   the Government, after further consultation with the Chamber  of  Shipping, authorised in September, 1930,  a specially  favourable rate of  grant (over 40 per cent.) for schemes  at  small ports likely to assist in the development  of agriculture.  No  formal application has yet been
made by any authority,  except that a request for grant at thehigher rate has been made in respect of a scheme already submitted for grant at the normal rate.  Detailed examination of a numberof particular cases of deserving small  ports  adduced by theChamber of Shipping  leaves doubt as to how far these minorauthorities will be able to produce schemes.   87. It is a condition  of  approval  of  schemes assisted underthis  special arrangement  that work should be put in hand  bythe  1st  January,  1931,  but representations have  just  beenreceived from the Shipowners&apos; Parliamentary Committee and the dock and Harbour Authorities&apos; Association that the time  limitwill  prevent authorities  from taking  advantage  of  the  terms offered.  This throws an  interesting light upon the practicability of securing  immediate emplo&apos;ment in connection with schemesof this kind, but  it will  probably  be necessary  to consider anextension of the time.   88. Mr.  Lloyd George observes that &quot;with such financialassistance &quot; (i.e., grants  under the Development Act, 1929) &quot; itwould be possible to  put in hand a considerable  number ofimportant.development works in seaport towns.&quot;  The present government have, in fact, offered grants in  respect  of schemesrepresenting over   13  millions of  expenditure.   As regards 1-1 millions of this total,  the dock authorities concerned have notyet found themselves able to accept the Government offers,  while in the case of another  11 millions for the Swansea and Port Talbotdock extensions the Railway Company has felt itself compelled to suspend the schemes,  after their approval by the Government.There remains, however,  the considerable volume of work repre-sented by  the schemes substantively approved by  the present government, mostly on the basis of grants equivalent to a littleover 30 per cent, of the total cost:      Railway owned docks (under Part I of      the Development Act)       ..      ..     2,300,000     Municipal and public trust docks  (under      Part  II)        ........     4,900,000                                             7,200,000   89. It must be  remembered that during the years 1920 to1929  schemes  of  dock  improvement  and  construction  wereassisted through the  machinery  of  the  Unemployment  GrantsCommittee to a total amount of  over  13 million (including an expenditure of over  3  million in the Port of London), whileschemes  amounting to  1J million were covered by guaranteesunder the  Trade  Facilities Acts.   90. Subject to what has been  said above as to the danger of encouraging Port Authorities into  merely competitive expenditureon schemes which will not  earn an  adequate  return  upon thecapital sum, it  can be agreed that the greater efficiency of our ports may  be of material assistance to trade. There is no doubtthat for  modernisation of equipment, and particularly loadingand  unloading  appliances, expenditure  of this kind  is withinthe scope of the Development  Act.   The Ministry of transport is  in  close touch with the Chamber of  Shipping and the port authorities, and there is no  obstacle to  the formulation of anysuitable  schemes which  the responsible  Dock  Authorities areprepared to put forward.
    PART V.Labour Supply.Minister ofC    *&apos; The (luestion as to  the practicability of carrying out theLabour.)    Liberal programme on the scale suggested and within the period           suggested is dealt  with by the  Departments more directly con-           cerned, but I should like to mention one or two points connected           with the question of labour supply.              2. The additional number for whom at the end of 12 months           employment is to be  found  is estimated to exceed 700,000, the           great majority of whom would be men.  I assume for the moment           that  this  is a real figure, and that it is &quot;  additional &quot; in  the sense           that  the proposals will not throw others out of work.  What kind           of labour will be required for the work to be provided ? The figure           is composed of men to be engaged on making or reconditioning           roads and bridges (350,000), on housing and regional development           (150,000), on establishing family farms and other reconditioning,           including trainees  (150,000), and  on electrical and telephone           development and the cultivation of family farms. The estimate           includes men employed on producing materials.  It appears that           work requiring something of the order of 500,000 men out of the           total is of the nature of &quot; pick and shovel&quot; work.   Can this           number of this kind of men be found out of  a live register of           2,200,000 ?   If they exist, can they be put to work in the places           where they are required ?              3. A large proportion of the total of 2,200,000 are obviously           unsuitable.   Half a million are women and 100,000 are juveniles.           Of the 100,000 men classified as &quot; normally in casual employment &quot;           and the  400,000 men  &quot; temporarily stopped &quot; some would be           unsuitable and in any case only a small proportion could be made           available, without  dislocating the industries in which  they are           intermittently employed.  The remaining 1,100,000 men, though           at the moment &quot; wholly unemployed  &quot; include at least a quarter           who are merely passing from one job to another and registering           in the  process or are obtaining employment in their  ordinary           occupation with  sufficient regularity to make them unwilling to           go on to emergency and temporary work.   A considerable number           more, though they have been unemployed for a longer period, have           sufficient expectation of re-engagement to be unwilling to consider           work such as road-work or land-work.   It is clear that the field for           the selection of half a million men of the stamina and temperament           required would leave little margin for the elimination of the unfit.           Yet experience has shown that a substantial proportion are unfit,           in physique or temperament, for this kind of work.   There have           been  significant complaints recently of the quality of  the labour           on which  road contractors have been compelled to rely.             4. There  are,  further, the limiting factors  of inconvenient           geographical distribution and of family ties.  Of the men who are           on paper  available, a large proportion will be required  to work           away from their homes.  The district rates for this kind of work           are not as a  rule  sufficient to enable  a man to  maintain himself           in lodgings and his  family at home, especially during the winter,           when work is liable to be interrupted by weather.  Any system           of allowances is objectionable in principle, very expensive, difficult           to work in practice, and has dangerous reactions.  There is no           doubt that these  factors will seriously restrict the availability of           labour which would be suitable for the kind of work to be done if           it were within reach of the men&apos;s homes.  In order to carry out           the programme large numbers would have to be moved,  and this           would be impossible without either special payments or substantial           i crease in wage rates.             5. This last consideration leads me to another general point.           Other Departments will, no  doubt, deal with  the effect of the           proposals  on the  cost of materials, and, indeed, the possibility
of providing materials for a programme compressed within thisperiod,  except by stimulating productive capacity far beyond what would  be  required at the end of the period.  As regardswages, a forced expansion of production on the scale contemplated would set in motion a series of influences which could hardly fail to increase cash wages (though not  their real value) in  theoccupations affected.  Such a result is wholly inconsistent withthe item placed  in the forefront of the  programme that &quot; costs ofproduction  must be reduced.&quot;  It will be  hopeless  to  exhortemployers and trade unions to reduce costs if the action of theGovernment is driving costs up.   6. The cumulative effect of all these considerations forces meto the conclusion that the acceleration and concentration,  whichare the essential difference between the Liberal programme andour  programme, are impracticable  from the  point of  view oflabour supply.   7. One other comment still on the assumption that 700,000is a real figure.  Most  of them will be employed on temporarywork.  What is to happen to them at the end of the two  years,especially as the programme, e.g., on roads, will  have exhaustedto a great extent the  road requirements of the country for aconsiderable time ?   If anything like this number were  to beemployed, we should be  merely  preparing for ultimate disasterunless the plans made careful provision for  a gradual transferback into industry.
                                    PART  VI.                      Finance of  the Liberal Proposals.jNotebythe     i. Tn considering the financial implications of the renewedo?tlieell0r   ProPosalIor a gigantic State loan I  think it best to begin from rootExchequer.) principles.  The rule governing legitimate  borrowing for State           development  works is well recognised.  Where the State directly           undertakes capital developments of a productive nature capable           of yielding a money return which will meet the interest and sinking           fund on the requisite capital loan, the State is justified in borrowing           the capital, and it  normally does so.  Telephone capital is a good           example.  This capital is productive and repays itself within the           lifetime of the plant and  equipment which the capital creates.           Since the termination of the war, some  100 million a large sum           to invest in any single industrial enterprise has been raised on           loan for this  purpose,  48 millions having been raised in the  last           four years.   Similarly postal and telegraph  capital which at  one           time under an old practice was met from revenue, is now raised           by loan. It is the same with public corporations set up under the           asgis of the State to carry out undertakings of a public character.           The Electricity Commission, engaged under  statute in  a vast           scheme  for  the improvement  of  the electrical service  of  the           country, possesses and exercises the power to borrow the capital           it  requires for remunerative capital works,  and for a large part           of this  capital the  guarantee  of  the Exchequer is statutorily           available.  Similarly the British  Broadcasting Corporation  has           borrowing powers  for remunerative works,  and the like powers           will quite  certainly  be conferred upon the  public authority           projected by  the present Government for the public management           of the traffic  of London.               2. Quite  different considerations arise  in  regard to works           which, though of a capital or durable nature, do not provide  any           return out of which interest charges or sinking fund can be met.           In the case of local authorities with their limited field of financial           operations, with their changing population and  their inelastic           field of  revenue, it is obvious that large current expenditure on           such  objects as  sewerage  works,  road  construction,  public           buildings would not only seriously derange their annual finances,           but might place an unfair burden on present ratepayers in respect           of services the benefit of which will be shared by future ratepayers.           Parliament has therefore aUowed a practice of borrowing for such           works to develop.               3. But the position of the State is far different.  Not only  is it           normally  able  to  finance extensive  capital works without in-           convenient variations of  taxation but such works as are not  of a           revenue producing character give little prospect of actual benefit           to future taxpayers.  Furthermore over the wide field of State           activities the need for  new works of a  capital  character is           practically continuous.   The  inherent unsoundness  of State           borrowing for such purposes has  been progressively recognised.           The classic examples  are the borrowings by  pre-war Conservative           Governments for naval works and public buildings.  Many works           of unproductive character may  no doubt be necessary but they           are not remunerative ; they confer no direct and obvious benefit,           and more and more of them are continually required as society           progresses.   If therefore their cost is borrowed in any  year, the           burden  of  that year&apos;s liability  is cast upon  posterity notwith-           standing that posterity must either shoulder or similarly pass on           to  a  still later generation the  cost of the  similar equipment it           requires.  For this  reason the  practice of State borrowing for           public works of this character  was universally condemned  and           has never been revived.               4. A good  example   is  found in  expenditure  upon  the           construction  of new  roads.  There is already  more than a  risk           of roads being built for  which  there is little or no traffic justifi-           cation  or which may only  further cripple the railways.   But           however useful new roads may  be and however much they may
improve the equipment of the country assuming that they doso they produce to the  authorities  who  construct them nomoney return out of which to meet the interest and sinking fundon any loan.  And as societ)&apos;  develops  and communities  arise in new places, new roads, which cannot now be usefully projectedwill in the  future come to be required.   However variable maybe the need for capital  expenditure  on  roads  considered  fromthe aspect of a single locality, the nation as a whole is likely torequire heavy annual expenditure of this character for an indefinite period.  On this ground the practice hitherto invariably followedof meeting the contributions of the Road Fund towards  capitalworks of construction or improvement of roads and bridges outof the annual revenue of the Fund is  in keeping with the soundprinciples which now govern national finance.   5,  The  Government,  in  its  other  development programmesalso, has so far followed  a system which  avoids any question ofa Government loan.  It has adopted the alternative of the annualState  grant.  The schemes in progress and projected have thecommon feature and the common merit that they are  almostwithout exception financed by loans which are not State loans.The development  schemes undertaken by  railways  and other public utility companies under Part I  of the Home development act are financed by capital raised or reserves possessed by thoseundertakings.   The  schemes  undertaken by local authoritiesthrough  the  agency  of  the St. David&apos;s Committee schemes which, it must be feared, tend as time goes  on  and programmesincrease to have less and less economic  ground  and  more andmore to resemble relief works are financed by loans  raised byand on the credit of the local authorities  concerned or by capitalsupplied  in the case  of  the smaller  authorities  by the  PublicWorks Loan Board.  The part of the State is to make an annual contribution towards the interest and  sinking fund on the loans.These contributions  are  often a large proportion of the  total annual cost;   they enable the  money to be readily raised and enable the local authority or other undertaking to bear the balanceof the annual charges for the loan. The system avoids the detri-ment to Government  credit which direct State borrowing would entail.  It avoids also all the obloquy and criticism which direct government  intervention  in  development  work  is liable  soquickly to  arouse.  Those annual grants from the State, beingannual contributions towards interest and sinking fund, representa continuing State liability which may be estimated, at any ratein the  early years after  schemes are  in  full operation, at  some 5,000,000 per annum on a capital expenditure of  100,000,000.   6.  A vast capital expenditure on housing has been secured inrecent years in a similar way, the capital having been raised bylocal authorities (with assistance in the  smaller  cases from thePublic Works Loan Board) or private  contractors, and the actionof the State having been limited to the grant out of Revenue of either an annual or a lump sum subsidy sufficient to  render the enterprise attractive to those undertaking it.   7.  With the aid of the State grants the  capital for the enterpriseabove alluded to is readily obtained  by those  who seek it far more readily than it would be by the State which is cumbered withthe vast liabilities of the war.   8.  Even so, this qualification must be made.  Although thecapital is readily obtained, it must not be supposed that its burdenis easily borne.  The indebtedness of  local authorities has beenswiftly rising, as is shown by the following figures, which go  up to1928 :-                                  1913.     1924.    1928.                                   m.       m.       m.

   Similarly, the State has heavy continuing subsidies to meetout of revenue.  Next year, for instance, we shall have to bear the following : These charges will continue for many years.  In the early futurethey will not merely continue but increase, especially under theDevelopment Act.   9. The suggestion of a great State loan for purposes unproduc-tive or only partially productive is completely out of accord with allnormal canons of finance.  It has  to be justified exclusively as anemergency measure in a period of crisis.  A case for it would ariseonly if the State had good economic grounds for undertaking by its  own  agency  from  its  own  resources development worksadditional to those which it is now promoting  and expects topromote through the agency of local authorities and others.   10. The Liberal case for such a loan needs, therefore,  verythorough examination, but the illuminating notes of my colleaguesdispense me from any necessity myself to examine it.   11. If I were dealing with a programme which was not merelyput forward with a skilful and persuasive pen but one which would stand the cool examination of practical men and emerge as  a business  proposition, and if the programme were reasonable in amount or spread over a reasonable time, I should feel no seriousapprehension about the Governments ability to raise the moneyupon loan.   Even if the programme  were unproductive, still, ifit were sound, I would be prepared to justify the raising of a loanby appealing to the character of the present emergency.  I shouldpostulate only that  such a loan ought to be repaid over a  com-paratively short period of years.  If such a scheme gave employ-ment to men who would  otherwise be unemployed, savings to theUnemployment Fund would result;  they might offset  some20 per cent, of the corresponding portion of the loan.  So far as inaddition the  work  indirectly  increased the  prosperity of thecommunity,  the benefit  to the community would be reflected insome advantage to the revenue of  the State.    12. All this may readily be conceded.  It has sometimes beencrudely said  that a view obtains in the Treasury that any moneyborrowed by the State automatically cancels another loan  of equal amount to enterprise, and  that any man employed by theState deprives another of private work.  This is a misrepresen-tation.  But it is necessary also to say, that in the economics  ofGovernment borrowing there are regions which are disputed and only partially explored, and the authors of the Liberal Plan haveno right  to  assume that, even if  their schemes were sound  inconception and reasonable in size, there would be no off-sets fromthe gross employment that it would create.    13. If I pass from sound schemes to the schemes of the Liberalpamphlet I find myself  in a different atmosphere.  I cannot forn^  part agree that  the proposed expenditure  on  the scale whichis assumed is sound or useful, or that it can be justified on any reasonable ground  of economics.  And the  emergency powers which are postulated would not be easily tolerated by the public.    14. In the first  place, the cost of long-term  money remainshigh though it is falling. It is not pleasant to go to the CapitalMarket for vast sums in  these conditions.  It is even less pleasantto contemplate that one&apos;s action in so going will tend to force the cost of long-term money up again, both against the State and against borrowers of all kinds.   Among the things most needed in  present conditions  is a substantial reduction in long-term money rates, indeed the Liberal Memorandum  says so !   How a Government Loan of the kind proposed can conduce to that end, it is difficult  to conceive.     15. Further the State when it goes to the capital market is not immune from the rules which govern the private undertaker. m.Housing SubsidyPart I of the Development Act  ..Part II of the Development ActColonial Development FundOther similar items14-6 0-4 3-7 1-0 1-1
 If it desires to raise money for new enterprise, certainly if it desires to raise it in vast quantities on reasonable terms, it must have an acceptable  proposition.  The  analysis to  which the Liberal Scheme has been subjected shows that, when its implications were pubhcly understood, it would be publicly distrusted as extravagant and wasteful.  Nor would it escape notice, that this vast extension of direct Government activity preceded by an emergency session would involve interference  with private rights  and the exercise of oppressive bureaucratic powers.  The authors of the pamphlet claim that the loan would  be acceptable  to the City and they instance the success of the recent issue of 4 per cent. Bonds. This instance is  not in point, for the issue was mainly for conver- sion purposes, an  object,approved and well  understood ;  it was also a transaction in short money and not in the long term market. For the reason that I have given, viz. : that the scheme is unsound, I judge it to be very unlikely that the money could be obtained save with great difficulty at very high rates, and with the serious effect of increasing the general rate of interest attracted by long- term loans, a  rate which for the general good of the  community urgently needs to  come down.    16. Even if it be supposed that money  could be raised on the scale and for the purposes which the Liberal  Plan  assumes,  it must still have a serious effect upon the financial organisation  of the country.  The size of  the plan  and its lopsidedness  defeat its financial object.  The Minister of Labour in her Memorandum has mentioned the probable effects of the  scheme if it  could be put  in effective  operation in  forcing up costs  of production  in particular industries  and accentuating the maladjustments from which  we  now  suffer and  Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s record both  in munitions  manufacture  and  in  other spheres  reinforces her conclusion.  There is a very definite possibility  of foreign invest- ment being increased, even seriously increased under the influence of such a loan, though it is an assumption of the  Liberal Plan that it would be decreased.   Nor can we ignore the probability that the general reception of proposals so ill-considered  would add to the depression in the heavy trades and the textile trade which are suffering most, and which  the proposals would benefit least. It would  damp  down projects for extension and reorganisation in areas of industry  where they are most required.  Even apart from the Liberal over-estimate of the number of persons to whom employment could be given by their scheme,  an over-estimate which  has been dealt with elsewhere, it is patent  that  there would be  grave  effects arising from repercussions of  the scheme upon the  community at large.  In time the turn in the  trade depression will  come.   The country, left  to  itself, will then be ready  to recuperate from existing troubles and industry will demand capital  once more for its own regeneration.  In  those conditions the continuing demand for capital for these schemes  schemes which once instituted cannot be dropped and  left derelict at a moments notice would have its worst results.    17. These observations have been directed to the first three sections of that chapter of the Memorandum which deals with finance.  The  fourth section produces a lot of figures  to show that the schemes will be so productive as to meet the interest and sinking  fund upon the loan.   Of these figures  I am profoundly sceptical.   I shall not waste time in examining them in  detail because the root  evil of the  proposal lies  in  the raising and the squandering of the  loan, not in the precise measure of its subsequent burden.    18. I prefer  to remind  my colleagues of the singular con- tradictions which the plan involves.  We are to make more roadsto cut out the railways.  We are to move -a  great indigenous population off the land in order to put another alien population upon it.   We are to increase the standard of life but  in our vast community of small  holdings  we should inevitably lower  it. We are to reduce expenditure and to add to it, to reduce the burden of the debt and to  increase it.   By conference we are to see  to thelowering of the costs of production and by an outpouring of moneywe are to put up the price of goods.  I shall look for a more reason- able and consistent plan before asking the British public to saddle itself with a new and gigantic liability.
      THE  MELLON  INSTITUTE OF INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH.   The Industrial Fellowship System was first presented to the public byDr. R. K. Duncan, of the University of Kansas, in an  article  entitled&quot; Temporary Industrial Fellowships &quot; (North American Review, May, 1909).In 1911 Dr. Duncan  was appointed to the University of Pittsburgh  to inaugurate the system in the Department of Industrial&quot; Research,  and theworking of  the Fellowships began in  a temporalv building erected  at  a cost of about 510,000.  In March,  1913, Messrs, A. W. &amp; R.  B. Mellonestablished the system on a permanent basis through the gift of over halfa million dollars.  While the Institute is an integral part of the university of Pittsburgh and works in close accord with it, it possesses an endowmentof its own and is under its own management.  The  industrial research ofthe Institute is organized on a contract basis, the problem being set bya person, firm or association interested in its solution, the scientific workerbeing found and engaged by the  Institute, and  an Industrial  Fellowshipbeing assigned for a period of at least one year.  Each holder of an IndustrialFellowship is given, for the time being, the broadest facilities  for accom-plishing a definite piece of research, and all results obtained by him belongexclusively to the founder (donor) of the Fellowship. Only one investigation is carried out on a particular subject at any one time, and hence  there isno duplication of  the  research activities of the Fellowships in  operation.The donor, on his part, provides a foundation sum that is adequate  to cover the annual cost of maintenance of the Industrial Fellowship,  comprisingoperating charges, the purchase of all necessary special apparatus  or other equipment,  and  the  salary of the  research  man or  men selected  towork on the  particular  problem, the  solution  of  which is of  concern to the donors.  This  sum of  money  is approximately $5,000 for eachresearch man  needed  on  the Fellowship.  The Institute is primarilyan industrial  experiment station, but the nature of its investigationalprocedure enables broad  training  of young scientists in research methods and  in special subjects of technology.  It also recognises the  need  of fundamental scientific research as  a background and source of stimulus for industrial research. It has funds that are devoted to the prosecution of investigations not suggested by industry, but planned within the Instituteand directed towards the study of more fundamental problems than thoseusually investigated for direct industrial purposes.   In  192S, 53 Fellowships  were being sustained by as  many differentcompanies, largely chemical manufacturers, while  twelve more Fellowships,representing about 23  per cent, of the  total research of the Institute, werebeing supported by trade associations.  The  researches  carried  out onbehalf  of the  associations generally  extend  over  several years ;  the investigations supported by the Laundryowners&apos;  National Association, forexample, have been in progress since  1915, and those  on behalf of theAmerican Refractories Institute since 1917. The Research Associate plan of the  Bureau of  Standards  and other Government Bureaux, though itdiffers in method of administration, provides similar research facilities for industry and possesses the same advantages and disadvantages.
     FINANCE OF THE LIBERAL AGRICULTURAL PROPOSALS.   The  two pivotal figures on which the estimates of cost are founded,are (a) the 100,000 family farms, and (b) the 150,000 men to be employed for five years, as to 50,000 on the equipment of the family farms and as to100,000 on the general programme of re-equipment and re-conditioning.Some of the latter work would, however,  be  carried out on land to be acquired for family farms.   Using the figures in the  Liberal Memorandum  the following results are reached :                        (1) Capital Expenditure.   The  family farm programme involves the acquisition of 3,000,000 acres of land  which it is estimated  can be obtained on the basis of a net rentalof 205. to 40s. per acre.                                                                Taking  the  mean figure of 30s.  per acre and  capitalising at  5 per cent, we get     ............   90,000,000      (This figure would be reduced by the amount represented  by purchasing for annuities  such land  as could  be  so  acquired.  Acquisition in discharge of Death Duties  would  be equivalent to purchase for cash).The cost of  new equipment taking an average of the  figures  for houses and buildings may be put at  750  per holding.  This work is expected to afford employment to 40-50,000  men and this figure implies that all the family farms will  be newly equipped. Total  cost     . .     . .     ..     ..   75,000,000The remaining  100,000 men are presumably to be employed  on the  general programme  of  re-conditioning and re-  equipment.   At 5,000*  men  per  1,000,000  spent, this  represents  20,000,000 a year, or in five years       . .     . .  100,000,000      (N.B. Not all  the land reconditioned would be used as  family farms and  some of the expense would be recover-  able.)Making a total for these three items of........  265,000,000   This total of  265,000,000 is,  as previously stated, an estimate  derivedfrom the data  in the Liberal Memorandum itself.   Up to this point itexaggerates the cost of the scheme for at least two reasons, viz. :         (1) If any considerable part of the 3,000,000 acres to be acquired    for family farms is to consist of land that is re-conditioned, an  average    price of  30 an acre prior to re-conditioning is probably too high.        (2) The whole of the 100,000 family farms would not require to be    newly equipped.  There would already  be available farm-houses,    cottages and buildings on the original farms.  On the other hand, if the  employment figure  is to  be  maintained at150,000 per annum,  50,000  of  whom are  to be  engaged on work of re-equipment and 100,000  on re-conditioning,  then  the total  expenditure involved under these two headings must be  175,000,000.   But the above-mentioned items do  not represent the entire capital cost of the scheme.  There would have to be added the following : -Compensation to be paid to displaced tenants for disturbance.          This might be anything from  2,000,000 to  5,000,000. Mean  figure    ................    3,500,000Costs of acquisition  of land,  say 2 per cent, on   90,000,000   (though, as previously stated, this last  figure may be an  over-estimate)..............    1,800,000Cost  of  providing and  equipping training farms for  15,000  trainees (75 per cent,  of the total settlers for each year) at   50 per place..............      750,000      (N.B. Nothing is  included for accommodation required  for trainees for other forms of rural employment or for the  training of members of the family intended to  assist  on the  farms (see paragraph 42  of this Memorandum.)Tenants&apos;  capital presumably to be provided  on loan  at an  average of  20 per acre for, say, 75 per cent, of the settlers.  This is, if anything, an under-estimate of the proportion who  would require the loan of capital     . .      . .     . .     . .   45,000,000      (Note. If  this money  were advanced  by the  banks  under Government guarantee, the State would only stand  the losses which,  on  the basis of past experience,  might  amount to  20,000,000.)Total of these supplementary items     ..    ..     ..     ..   51,050,000Making with the three main items a total of    . .     ..       316,050,000   * If this calculation be based on 4,000 men per  1,000,000 spent, theestimate would be increased by  25,000,000.
   This figure does not include provision for (a) any expense involved in providing temporary housing for the  150,000 workers to be employedin building  and re-conditioning ;  and  (b) the cost of migration or anyexpense which may be involved in providing new accommodation for thosedisplaced  by the family farmers.                         (2)  ANNUAL COST.(a) Rent or interest  on purchase  money for land at, say,              30s. per acre      ............   4,500,000(b) Interest  on compensation money  ..     ..      ..     ..      175,000(c) Interest  on cost of equipment at 5 per cent, in perpetuity,      i.c,  assuming unlimited life       . .     ..      ..     ..   3,750,000(d) Maintenance, management, loss of rent,  outgoings and      contingencies, say  . .     . .     . .     . .      . .     . .    1,500,0009,925,000(e)  Less gross rents of family farms (Rent 30/. per acre, plus      return on equipment, etc.) say   . .     ..     ..     . .    6,825,000       (Note. Items (a), (c) and (e) may be over-estimates      for  the  reasons  given  in  Statement   (1) Capital      Expenditure.   The net figure of , 3,100,000, however,      would probably not be greatly affected thereby, and any      reduction might be offset by an increase in item (/) for      the reason indicated in Statement 1.)(/)  Interest on  one half  of the  100,000,000 spent  on re-      conditioning       ............    2,500,000(g)  Interest on capital outlay on Training Farms ( 750,000)      andcostof acquisition of land  1,S00,000)      ..     ..      127,500(h)  Interest on amount of loans is assumed to  be paid by      settlers, but some concession in this respect would be      necessary at least for the first year or two,  and some      losses must be anticipated . .     ..     . .     . .     . .       (i)  Costof training,say, 15,000 men annuallyfor 5 years at, say,       3  per  man per week for  9 months.   This   3 is the      figure supplied by the  Ministry of Labour, and includes      all running costs, but  no allowances for the trainees or      their dependents............1,SOO,000       (This figure would not include the training of depend-      ents or other workers.)(j)  Provision for  family  allowances  during the period  of      training, and for maintenance for a period after training      was completed.  If this can be estimated  at  100 per      man, it would cost, annually for 5 years. .     ..     ..    1,500,000       (This figure might be reduced if provision were made      for the training of dependents.)                     Total    .......... 9,027,500   To this total of approximately  9,000,000 must be added any allowance in respect of interest on the advances to settlers see (h) above.  It includesnothing  for assisting transport, or  advertising and marketing Britishgrown foodstuffs.  The figures of  &quot;6,000,000  in the Liberal Memorandumincludes  3,000,000 for these two itens together with net losses on trainingcentres.   Considering that the  annual losses  on training centres aloneare shown by the above  figures  (items (i) and (j) ) to be over  3,000,000,it is clear that the estimate of annual cost on the Liberal Memorandum isvery inadequate.   The estimate of  9,000,000, plus whatever is spent on advertising and marketing, must, however, be reduced by any amount by which item (/)may overlap with items  (a)  and (c) a point on which the memorandum is not clear.   Items (i) and  (j)  would  disappear  on completion of  the  five years&apos;training  programme covered by this  expenditure.   The  above  estimate  does not include any costs  of  Headquarters&apos;administration.
