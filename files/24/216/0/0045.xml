fci o- s-*iiDOCUMENT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC i-tAJESTY&apos; S G0VERNi 5NT.I394(30)COPY NO.CABINET.        MERCHANT SHIPPING (SAFETY CONVENTION) BILL.     Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.   1. A situation has arisen in regard to the MerchantShipping (Safety Convention) Bill on which I desire  to consultmy colleagues.   2. This Bill, following approval &quot;by the Cabinet on the29th October, was introduced into the House of Lords on the5th November and given Second Reading on the 18th November,when a motion was carried referring the Bill to a JointCommittee of both Houses.   The Second Reading Dehate s)aowed,as was expected, opposition in certain quarters to the Bill inrespect of the helm orders provisions-otTs of the Convention.   3. Apart from this, the main objection taken to the bill was that it deals only with the Safety Convention (signed31st May, 1929, and to come into force on the 1st July, 1931)and does not include the Load Line Convention (signed5th July, 1930, and to come into force on the 1st July, 1932).   4. This objection comes from the shipowners who,  althoughthe Government Bill was sent to them on the 8th August,  didnot move in the matter until the last moment.   Efforts  weremade in vain to get the Shipowners&apos; Parliamentary Committeeto confer with the Department.    Instead they have caused tobe introduced into the House of Lords a rival Bill purporting to bring into force both the Conventions.   Their Bill it maybe said, is open to the strongest criticism.   5* The shipowners&apos; Bill had its First Reading on13th November and is to come up for Second Reading at a  datenot yet fixed.   It is no doubt the intention of the Lords
9 ,0 $ILJ V yjto refer it to the same Joint Committee as that  to  which theGovernment Bill has &quot;been referred.    We shall then  be  in the difficult position of having conflicting Bills in the  sameJoint Committee where each will  have to meet the attacks ofthe supporters of the rival Bill, while both will be attacked by those who object on one ground or another to  the provisionsof the Conventions.  The result at best will be a delayed bill of an unsatisfactory character;  at the worst, and  this ismore likely, failure to get any  Bill on the subject throughboth Houses.   6. Time is of the first importance.   It is a duty  of theBritish Government to ratify these two Conventions  as  soon  aspossible.   To fail in this is to set back the method  ofinternational settlement of maritime problems and to lose ourlead in such matters.   7. We have therefore got into touch informally with the shipowners, whose attitude is modified by the reception givenby the Lords to the helm orders provisions of the Convention,and it is likely that accommodation could be reached asfollows:   8. Both  the Government Bill and the Opposition Bill to be withdrawn;  the Government to undertake the preparation of  aBill covering both Conventions, the Shipowners&apos;  parliamentary committee assisting to secure a draft Bill mutuallysatisfactory, and the Bill to be introduced into parliament as soon as possible.   It is not likely to be ready before christmas.   This course appears to offer the only  reasonable chance of our getting into a position to ratify the conventions within a reasonable time.   To go on as at present is to make  ratification within any reasonable time  most unlikely.   9. On the Safety Convention, opposition apart from  the  ship-owners&apos; attitude is unlikely except on the matter of helm orders.                              -2-
The Load. Line Convention may &quot;be attacked on  the ground  that itallows deeper loading than at present  to tankers and  to timbercarrying ships.    This attack will  not be formidable, for there are good grounds for allowing deeper loading  in thesecases and all the shipping interests,  including the officersand seamen, regard the Convention as a step  in advance  as  itwill make ships  safer all the world over.   Iluch more attention will be paid to  the security of hatches and  other deck  openingsthan has hitherto been the case.   My colleague will  remember that this was the conclusion we came to when the convention was discussed in the Cabinet (Cab.  Cones. 33(30)  11).I think, therefore, that opposition on the ground  of  meritcan be overcome if we are not at the same time being  opposed by the shipowners in matters of form.   10. The withdrawal of the Government measure  is  unpalatable,especially in view of the way in which the shipowners havebehaved, but the overriding interest is the  earliest  possibleratification of the Conventions;  and with that  object  in view suggest that I be authorised to endeavour  to come to  anarrangement with the shipowners on the above line,s^  Ifsuccessful, I should propose also to consult the PartyOppositions.24.11.30.
