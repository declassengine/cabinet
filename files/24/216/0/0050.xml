I  am not Opp osodto tho suggestion you are making to  the Cabinet.    Itis one way in which the difficulty may  be settled.          As far as the change  in helm  orders is  concerned,the ship owners Bill, introduced by  Earl Stanhope,  contains the same provision as in the Government Bill.    I understand from Earl Stanhope that there  is no  desire from  the promoters of tho Bill, introduced by him, to  alter  in thisrespect tho terms of the agreed  International Convention.          There is some advantage in including bothConventions in one Bill, and this could be made  a matterof arrangemento   If such agreement  is  secured,  tho holmorders proposal will not give  rise to serious difficulty.On the question of time, thore  seoms to be little difference between proceeding  with the present Bill and arranging for a new one*          I should have wished  a further word with you sothat this question of Procedure  might have been  settled.                  Yours very sincerely,                      (Sgd)  PARMOCR.TLe lit.IIon ,Wn Graham, M.P.,    Board of Trade.2.  Whitehall Gardens,  S.Y/,1,    25th November, 1930./
