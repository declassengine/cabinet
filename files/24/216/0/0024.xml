THIS. D0CU1.1EKT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.     KING&apos; S ROLL NATIONAL SCHEME FOR,. DISABLES EX-SERVICE MEN -          APPLICATION FROM RUSSIAN OIL PRCDUCTS LIMITED.1.   I desire to &quot;bring to the attention of my colleagues anapplication received from Russian Oil products Limited, forenrolment on the King&apos;s Loll for Disabled Lx-Service Men.2.   The King&apos;s Roll was established by Royal Proclamationin 1919 for the purpose of assisting disabled ex-servicemen to obtain employment.   A copy of the Proclamation isattached.   All employers who undertake to employ a givenpercentage of such men (usually 5 per cent, of the totalnumber of employees) are enrolled under the Scheme and areentitled to use the King&apos;s Roll Badge of Honour.   Inaccordance with a resolution passed by both Houses oflarliament on the 16th February,1926, preference in theallocation of contracts is given to enrolled firms.   Theresolution was in the following terns:-     That, in the opinion of this House, it is the duty     of the Government in all Government Contracts to make     provision for the employment to the fullest possible     extent of disabled ex-service men, and to this end     to confine such contracts, save in exceptional     circumstances, to emplo3rers enrolled  on the King1 3     National Roll.This formal resolution confirmed what had been the practiceof Government Departments since 1921.3,   No reference is made in the Scheme to any qualification for enrolment other than that of employment of the properquota  of disabled men.   Accordingly, in the administrationof the Scheme the miniotrv of Labour has not in general paidRjJlR E T.n.P.373(30).CABINET.1.
regard to questions such as the nation a lit;, of employers, hours and rates of wages, and. other cognate matters.4.   Russian Oil Products limited is registered as a british company but it is understood that all the Directors are Russian.The Company epplled in 1928 for enrolment but, although theysatisfied, all the ordinary conditions, it was decided,  to refuse the application in view of the then diplomatic situation betweenGreat Britain and- Russia.   this decision, which was taken afterconsultation with, end on the edvice of, the hone Secretary, was based, largely on the contention that the Company could, not properly be included ae.ong the persons referred, to in the Royal Iroelamationas &quot;Our loyal subjects&quot;, nor could the Company properly sign theusual undertaking intended for signature by &quot;patriotic employers&quot;.In refusing the application no explanation we.s given to the Company.5.   The Company has how made a further application for enrolmentand satisfies the condition of employing the proper quota, ofdisabled men.   It appears from previous reports that  the Companyhas tendered for a Cardiff Corporation contract but cannot obtainthe contract unless the;-/ ore on the king&apos; s Roll.   The need, to heon the Roll in order to obtain such contracts is no doubt the motive for the application.6.   Bo far as the ordinary rules are concerned there  is no validreason why the application should be rejected.   I have consulted the Home Secretary however and in view of what he says I feel thatthe question should not be decided on purely departmental linesbut is one of general policy for consideration by the  Cabinet.I am anxious to secure an early decision es the Comp:ny are pressing for a reply to their application.
