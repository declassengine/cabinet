SECRET.COPY no cp ,392(5 0).CABINET.   UtTEM?LOYMBNT  INSURANCE  FOR  THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY.        Memorandum  by  the  Minister  of  Labour.     Lady Noel-Buxton  has  given notice  of her  intention tomove on Wednesday next a resolution calling attention  to  thequestion of the  extension  of unemployment insurance  to agricultural workers.     I attach a  memorandum which sets  out the  present  position on this subject  as  it  has  developed within  recent months.It will be seen  that as a  result of a  conversation which  I had with the Prime Minister at the beginning of July, It was  decidedthat in view of  the present state of the Unemployment  fund the negotiations with  the  industry  should not  be carried further at that  time.    The position  of the Fund has  notimproved, and, moreover, we have announced  our intention  toappoint a Royal  Commission to  deal  with the whole subject ofUnemployment Insurance.    Our intention is that the scopeof the national  scheme shall be one  of the  questions to beconsidered by the Commission.    This will  necessarily raisethe question of  the inclusion  of agriculture.     I 3hould like  to  have the views of the Cabinet as to theline I should take  in  the debate next Wednesday.    I  suggest thatI should express sympathy with the  object of the motion butrefer to the difficulties  surrounding the matter and say  thatas the scope of  the national scheme  is one  of  the subjects thatwill be considered  by  the Royal Commission, the question  of theinclusion of agriculture must then arise.    Penddng suchconsideration by the Commission It would be premature  to  comoto a decision *(Intd. )  M.G.B.14th November, 1920.
f-J til ^     NOTE ON THE POSITION WITH REGARD TO TEL DEMAND FOR        M UNLkPLOYI-IENT INSURANCE SCEITX FOR AGRICULTURE.     The question of the inclusion of agriculture under ascheme of unemployment insurance has heen more or less activesince 1920.   Tv/o Committees considered the subject in 1^20and 1926.   The former reported against the proposal, end thelatter,  by the casting vote of the Chairman, reported in favourof it.   The demand was revived last year when a deputation,which included several members of the House, urged the inclusionof agriculture in an unemployment insurance scheme.   Considera-tion of the question v:as promised, and steps were takenDepartmentalism to discuss the practicability of a scheme.                                                 -     Notice of a Motion on the subject was given in the Houselast January when the Cabinet agreed -     &quot;That the Minister of Labour should state that the matter      was receiving consideration, and especial!;- its difficult      financial aspects;  that.it had always been recognised      that the economic position of agricultural workers      differed from other industrial workers, and that it had      often been urged that any insurance scheme suited to      their circumstances would have to be separated from other      insurance schemes;  the solution of these difficulties      must take time and it would not be possible to introduce      legislation during this Session to :;ive effect to the      Government&apos;s policy.&quot;  (Cabinet 5(30) paragraph 10).     In March the Cabinet again  considered the matter and agreed -     &quot;That the Minister of Labour should discuss the question  -      on an informal and non-committal basis with representatives                                                          -      of employers  and employed in the industry, without                                    -                                                /communicating
9 0 ;1f-J 1/ (if      communicating anjr official Memorandum and without      malting it known that the Question had &quot;been considered      by the Cabinet.&quot;                      (Cabinet 15(30) paragraph 10) .     A deputation representing the workers&apos; side of theindustry was received in May and regarded favourably certaininformal proposals for a scheme which was discussed withthem.   The next step contemplated was to bring the matter before the employers&apos; representatives, but certain memberscf the workers&apos; deputation in conversation after their meeting expressed the view that it would be unwise to consult the Farmers on the insurance question until theconstructive part of the Government agricultural policy was before the country;  in a discussion on the Report of  thedeputation between the Prime Minister and the Minister ofLabour it was decided that in view of this attitude and ofthe then state of the Unemployment Fund the Minister shouldnot carry any further for the moment negotiations with the interested parties and should not give any promise of  esrlylegislation on the subject.     Since that time no further steps have been takencalling for departmental or Cabinet action.
