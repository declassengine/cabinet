REPORT.I. INTRODUCTORY.(a) Composition and  Terms of  Reference.   ON the  24th  July,  1980,  the Prime Minister  appointed  aCommittee of the Economic Advisory  Council  with the following terms of  reference :        &quot;  To review the present economic condition of Great Britain,   to  examine the  causes which  are  responsible  for  it  and to   indicate the conditions  of recovery.&quot;   2.  The Committee was constituted as follows: Mr. J. M. Keynes, C.B.  (Chairman).Mr. H. D. Henderson.Professor A. C. Pigou.Professor L. Bobbins.Sir Josiah C. Stamp,  G.B.E.   Mr. A.  F.  Hemming, C.B.E.,-j       Joint   Secretary,  Economic [ Joint Secretaries   3.  Our Report falls  naturally into two  main parts.   In thefirst  we deal in Section II with  the causes of the present depres-sion,  and in Section III with the effects of the fall of prices.  Inthe second part of our Report we turn to a detailed considerationof possible measures that  might be taken to meet  the local difficul-ties of this country.   In Section IV we consider possible measuresof an international character.  In Section V  we discuss steps thatmight be taken to restore elasticity to  the economic structure ofthis  country, and  in  Section  VI ways of  increasing industrial efficiency.  Section VII is devoted to the consideration of the levelof domestic money wages, and Section VIII to  the practicability of granting of  subsidies  to  wages.   In Section  IX  we  considerpossible ways of increasing business confidence, and in Section Xways  of  increasing home  investment.   Section XI is devoted to-tariffs, and  Section XII  to  the  possibility  of bringing  about  ageneral adjustment of money incomes.  Our general  conclusions are summarised in Section XIII.  We  have attached to our reports  statistical  appendix  prepared by  the  Staff of the  economic advisory Council.   4.  Professor Robbins has not felt able to sign our Report for reasons which he has  set  out separately.   II. THE  CAUSES OF  THE  PRESENT DEPRESSION.   5.  The present depression of trade is one which Great Britainshares with most of the civilised world.  Since the  autumn of lastyear we have been in the grip of a downward fluctuation of  trade which  has engulfed  almost every country, whether free  trade orprotectionist, agricultural or manufacturing, backward or forward in economic efficiency.  To suppose  that this catastrophe is due tothe  policy  of  particular  Governments  or  the   inefficiency  ofparticular groups of  producers would be to ignore obvious facts.Mr. R. F. KahnAdvisory Council(b) Arrangement of Report.(a) Great Britain and the World Slump.
    6.   Nevertheless, there  are certain peculiarities in the positionof  Great  Britain  which distinguish her difficulties from those ofthe rest of the world.   Up to the eve of the great slump, speakingvery broadly, the rest of the world was experiencing a period of prosperity.   In America,  indeed,  trade was definitely booming.Elsewhere the main indices of activity were favourable.  But inGreat Britain, although some parts of the country e.g., London and   some  trades,  exhibited considerable  prosperity,  speaking generally we were suffering from serious malaise.  It  is important,however,  not to exaggerate the dark  side of the picture.   some industries were  going  ahead fairly  rapidly.  Beal  wages had risenconsiderably:  between  1924  and   1928 average  real  wage-ratesincreased 6-5 per  cent.,   and  average real earnings  per  weekincreased 8-5 per  cent.0  But when all this  is taken  into account,the general  verdict must be that we were not doing nearly as wellas we  could have done.  The total of  unemployed had not sunkperceptibly below  a  million  since 1924.   Great areas  in  the Northwere stationary  or declining.  Our  export trade as a whole showeddisquieting  symptoms of stagnation.    7.   Before the advent  of the  great slump there was lack of adjustment  in our position  relatively to other countries. (2)   Sincethe slump began there is no reason to suppose that this conditionhas been  remedied.  In judging our present troubles we have to distinguish  between the difficulties which we share with the restof the  world  and those which are peculiar  to our  local want of adjustment.   We  examine  first  these local difficulties, since it is over these that we may hope to exercise most control.  (b) The Nature of the Domestic Difficulties of Great Britain.   8.  The depression of trade in  Great Britain since  the war may be  regarded as being the  resultant of two  sets of  causes :(a)  adversely  changing  external conditions,  and  (b)  a  lack  ofinternal  adaptability.                      (i) External  Changes.   9.  The main changes in  the  broad external  environment  ofBritish  industry since  the  War  are  too  well  known  to needextensive comment.  Broadly  speaking they may be classified  asfollows :    (a) There  have  been changes  in  the conditions  of  demand          for  the  products  of  various  industries,  due  to the          change  from   war   to  peace.   During  the  War the          industrial structure  of this  country suffered  abnormal          distortions.   To  meet  the  demands  of war,  many          industries  were  distended  to an  extent  which the          demands of peace  could  not profitably sustain.  At the          end of the War, after  the  brief inflationary boom, these          industries  were plunged  into depression.   In  the ten          years that  have  elapsed  considerable  contraction has          taken place, but it  would be rash  to  assert that this          process is by  any  means over.(3)   (b) Side by  side with these abnormal changes of demand, but          in their effects closely parallel with them, come certain          general changes in world economic conditions.   Of these          the most important are (i)  the development of the cotton          industry  in the East;  (ii) the less  favourable terms on          which the agricultural  areas of the world have succeeded          in disposing of their products a change which not only          affects the volume  of  demand for  the  products of our          export industries,  but also  carries with it an  adverse          movement  of  domestic   agricultural prices;    (iii)  the          spectacular decline  that has  taken place in the value of          silver, which has had  the  effect of considerably intensi-          fying the difficulties  of our trade with the Far East; and   (&apos;) London and Cambridge Economic Service: Article in April 1930 issue and subsequent figures.   (2) See Appendix, Tables A, H and M.   (8) See Appendix, Tables D and F.
       (iv) the considerable substitution of oil  for bunker coal       and  of  hydro-electric  power  by  countries  formerly       dependent on British coal.(&apos;)(c) Our difficulties in this respect have  been  aggravated by       certain political misfortunes  which have intensified  the       effects  of changing demand.   In some  ways we have       been definitely  unlucky.    It  is  conceivable  that  the       occupation  and evacuation  of  the  Buhr, with  its dis-       disturbing effects on the coal trade, the currency disorders       in  France, Italy,  Belgium  and Germany, the General       Strike  and the troubles in India and China might have       been averted by extraordinary prescience on the part of       statesmen, but their main  weight has fallen on those who       were powerless to prevent them,  and  their cumulative       effect has been felt by  a  society whose  powers of rapid       adaptation were already being strained to the utmost.(d) The incidence of these changes was to some  extent localised       and particular.   The fall  in  gold prices  in general, and       of sterling prices in particular, which took place between       1924 and 1929 had a  wider influence.   Opinions still       differ sharply  about the extent of the dislocation which       was  brought  about by  the restoration of  the  gold       standard; but it is clear  that, in so far as it raised the       value of  the pound, it increased  the difficulties of  the       export  industries.   If  gold  prices in general had risen       after  that  event,  little  difficulty  wxmld  have  been       experienced.   As it was, they  continued to fall,  thus       accentuating the difficulties of readjustment. (s)(e) Finally, there can be no doubt  that we  have suffered from       the tariff policies of other  countries.                     (ii) Internal  Rigidities.    10.   Changes of the kind outlined above are bound to impose on any  economic system the necessity of readjustment.   They may even be the occasion of an inevitable and permanent loss.  But theextent to which they  actually damage  any given system depends upon the ease with which it adapts itself to change and upon the flexibility with which it responds to the new conditions  of demand,of price and production.  Even with perfect flexibility, some lossmay still be inevitable.  But if flexibility is absent, the  loss will bemuch more considerable.    11.   Unfortunately there is reason to suppose  that,  in theperiod since the War, our capacity for rapid adaptation has beeninadequate.  This  is  due  in  part  to  adverse changes  in the agecomposition of the population.  The proportion  of the more activeage-groups was drastically curtailed by the losses of the War;  andconsequently  there is a shortage  of  men  in the  prime of life in important  positions.    12.   Lack  of adaptability has also been due to the  domination of  false ideas.  Since  the War, a  series  of  policies has beenfashionable,  each capable of ingenious defence in itself, but thewhole  tending cumulatively  to   industrial  ossification  and the diminution  of  the  National Dividend.   These tendencies  show themselves  in  three ways:     (i)  In the first place they may be seen in the increase of rings          and  monopolistic  combinations designed deliberately  to          restrict the volume of trade.  This does not  mean that          large-scale  rationalised production is  necessarily bad  or          that all combinations are of a restrictive nature.   But it          is clear that much that passes as legitimate and far-seeing          industrial policy is in  fact  restrictive and  anti-social.          Examples  of this  type  will  readily  occur   to  anyone          familiar  with the cotton trade or the various industries          which provide the materials of housing.                 (*) See Appendix, Tables E and J.                 (&apos;) See Appendix, Table B.
    (ii) Secondly, there has been a reluctance on the part of industry          to recognise the existence of changed conditions,  either          on the side of technique or on the side of demand.    (iii)  Thirdly,  the persistence of  restrictive rules  and practices          among trade unions has been very  marked.  These take          two  forms:   (a)  restrictions  on  entry  to  particular          occupations and the demarcation of  different occupations,          and (b) restrictions on the conditions under which certain          work can  be  done.These restrictions involve  craft  loyalties and attachments  to  oldcustoms   which  it  would  be  wrong   to  undervalue,   but   itwould  be  equally  wrong  to  ignore  their deleterious  effects  on production.   If  men are excluded  from a particular  occupation,they are either  unemployed or are compelled to sell their  labour for lower  rates elsewhere.   If employers are prevented from using the  most  up-to-date methods  of  production,  the  efficiency  ofindustry  suffers  and  the  total  available   for  distribution   isdiminished.  If,  in  the  last ten years,  productivity has failed toincrease at the rate it might otherwise have done, it would be wrong to absolve from  responsibility  such policies as result in one manworking four looms when in other countries men work at least twiceas many,  or in  a man  taking  four  years to qualify  as  a buildingoperative  when  he  could  certainly  do  so in one.   Customs  ofthis sort might have some  justification in  a  society isolated fromworld competition.  But in a world of rapid change, their persistencemust lead to local stagnation and decay.    13.  The  internal  paralysis  from  which society  has- beensuffering since the War manifests itself in yet another  way  which,from the point of view of the causation  of unemployment,  is evenmore important.   We  refer to  rigidities  in the price and  incomestructure.    14.  It  is clear  that  since  the War there  has  been  presentin our price and income structure  much greater  rigidity  of this sort than at any earlier period in our history.   The  rigidity ofcertain prices is well known;  it is the obverse side of the policy ofmonopolistic  restriction  referred   to  above.   The  rigidity   of wage-rates  in  certain  sheltered  industries is also well  known.Before the  War, if  unemployment  in any industry went  beyond  certain  point,  it  was in the  interests  of  the trade unions tomodify  wage-rates.  To-day,  the existence of the  unemploymentinsurance  system, divorced as  it has become from  any actuarialbasis,  is  tending  to  prevent  these  adjustments.  Yet if such adjustments  are  not made, it is a matter of common experiencethat unemployment  follows.    15.  If in a single industry there were much unemployment, inwould be fair to argue that  wages in that industry were too high inthe sense  that if they were lower there would be less unemployment.But this  argument  cannot be  extended in  its simplest form to industry  as  a whole in  the  pre-slump  period, for two reasons,viz. :     (a) Although  some  wages  may have  been  too  high,  in  this          sense,  others may have  been too low in the sense that          if the  restrictions which kept wages high  in the  one          industry had  been removed,  those wages  might have          risen.    (1)1 Changes in wages have  general reactions upon  productivity          in industry as a whole.  And it may well have been that          before  the recent slump, if the rigidity of wages had been          relaxed, the improvements  in efficiency and the  rate of          progress thus made possible  would almost immediately          have  created  a  situation  where a greater  volume of          employment would have been  secured without seriously          impairing the average wage.    16.  For it is quite clear  that rigidity of wage-rates is capableof  being  a definite hindrance  to  change  and  to progress.   Therate at which an industry can  expand is, in part, a function of therate of wages it has to pay. If, for example, the increase of wages
in the building industry had been less,  the rate of building wouldhave  been greater, the price of houses  would have been less,  the redistribution  of  the  population  would have  taken  place  more rapidly,  and the  general purchasing  power of wages  would havebeen  greater.(6)   17.   Moreover, when wages are kept rigid,  there  is a  grave danger  that the  arrangement  of  industry  which  is thus broughtabout may be injurious to the  interests of the working classes asa whole.  Labour-saving machinery which, from the point of viewof securing full  employment  for  the  total working population, isdefinitely uneconomical, may be introduced, and, at the same time,the full  benefits  of  desirable rationalisation  may  be lost.   Thereis a  considerable consensus  of  opinion  that  the  &apos;&apos; technological&apos;&apos;unemployment,  of which  much has  been heard  in  Germany inrecent years is due to these  causes.                Ill THE  FALL  OF  PRICES.   18.  Between  1924 and  September  1929 gold prices  of  staple commodities, as calculated in Dr. Bowley&apos;s special index number,fell in the United  States by 4 per cent., in  Sweden by  14  per cent.and  in Holland by 14 per cent.  In the United Kingdom over thesame period, sterling prices of the same class of commodities,  partly in consequence of  the return to gold, fell 22 per cent.  In the years which have since elapsed there has been a further catastrophic fall:between September 1929 and August 1930,  dollar prices fell 21 percent., Swedish prices  14 per cent.,  Dutch prices 17 per cent.,  and sterling prices 17 per cent.  In the great depression of the eighteen-nineties, prices fell about 18 per cent, altogether,  spread over aperiod of six years.  Apart from the slump of 1921, when the fallwas  from an exceptional point reached  so rapidly that it had not had time to affect established costs of production,  there is  no recordedcase in recent economic history of so violent and rapid a collapse inthe  prices  of staple commodities.(7)   19.  As against this very large fall in the wholesale prices  ofstaple commodities  (30 to 35 per  cent,  since 1924  in  terms  of sterling),(8)  British money wage-rates  have  remained  virtuallyunchanged.  Between 1924  and September 1929  wages fell 1 percent., whilst  during the  past year  they have fallen by less than another 1 per cent.(9)   20.  It  is  not to  be  expected  that the  fall in  the cost  ofliving will   be so  great  as  the  fall in the  prices  of  staple commodities,  since, by the  time  goods  reach  the  consumer,  aconsiderable part  of the  price represents home costs  of  one kindor another,  including manufacturing,  distribution and  retailingcosts, which do not fall so long as  our own level of money wagesis maintained, except  at  the expense of normal business returns.Actually,  the  cost  of  living fell 5 per cent, between  1924  and september 1929, and has fallen only  a further S  per  cent, duringthe past year.(10).    It may be that  the more recent of  these figuresdoes not yet reflect the  full effect of the fall which  has already occurred in staple commodities,  owing to time lags, frictions, etc.   21.  We do not think it prudent to  assume that there  maynot  be a further fall  of  world prices.  We  should  expect  somerecovery from the present exceptionally low level at a date whichmay be  near  at  hand.  But  it is not certain  that  this rise  ofprices will  go far enough  to mend the situation or  that it  maynot  be followed by a  further sagging tendency in the  price-levelcontinued over a long period.  The existing international  situation as it  affects  credit, rates of  interest, the state of international confidence and the use of gold in bank reserves has not necessarily       (a) See Appendix, Tables G, I, K  and L.

done its  worst.  For the same reasons that it  has  been producing a fall  of prices  hitherto,  its  mere  continuance  may provoke  afurther fall  for some  little time to come.      (a) Effects  of Large Changes in the Value of Money.   22.   We  would wish  to  affirm with  all the emphasis  at  ourcommand the disastrous consequences which are to be expected ifthis  fear were to be  fulfilled.   All  money settlements  of  every kind, upon which the stability and prosperity of  modern life,organised as  it is, so profoundly depend, would become hopelesslyinappropriate international settlements and national debts not  lessthan money wages.   23.   Outstanding  examples of this are  the  following:    (a) The  effective  burden of inter-Governmental debts  arising          out of  the  war is  very greatly increased.   In the case          of  German reparations, for example,  it is probable that          the whole of the concessions made to Germany by  the          Young  Plan, as compared with the  Dawes  Plan, have          been obliterated by the fall in prices which has occurred          subsequently.   The safeguards against this  very danger          contained in the Dawes Plan were withdrawn under the          Young Plan, and the payments under the  Young Plan are          already in serious jeopardy.   (fc) The budgetary burden of  internal National- Debts is  also          greatly  aggravated.   It  is not easy at this  stage to          calculate the amount  of  the  increase,  since the level          of  money  incomes  at home has not  yet adjusted itself          to  the  external  price-level.   But  if this  adjustment          were made, the value of  money incomes  derived from          interest on  the National  Debt would be  increased by          30 per cent, as  compared with 1924,  and  by 15  per cent.          as  compared with 1929, at the expense of  the rest of          the community. (I2)             The  same argument  applies, of course,  to  all other          forms of bonded debt expressed in terms of money.  In          the case of industry, the percentage of the gross receipts.          reduced in  terms of money, required to  meet debenture          and preference  interest, not reduced in terms of money,          is seriously increased.   (c) The same considerations apply to many other  Government          obligations,  which  are fixed in terms of money even          when the  arrangements   governing  them  are not so          unalterable as those governing  the National Debt so long          as  no measures are  taken  by  Parliament to alter  them.          This applies, for  example, to  all  pensions,  and, in  par-          ticular,  to unemployment relief.  The latter was fixed in          1920 at 15s. for the single man, when the cost of living          was particularly high.  With the present cost of living,          9s.  to-day has  the  same value as 15s. in August 1920.          As a matter of fact the  money value of unemployment          benefits has  been  substantially  increased  since  1920,          with the result that the real benefits to-day are at least          double  what was thought adequate in  1920. (&quot;)   (d) Money  wages and money  incomes  generally,  other  than          business profits,   which  constitute   the residue,  also          become  seriously  inappropriate  to   the  new  situation          unless  they are altered.   In  these   cases,  the obstacle          to  a change is for the most part neither law nor contract,          but a strong social resistance  to changes which, for the          very reason that they would  have to take place  piece-          meal and without  any ordered plan, are  likely  to be          open to charges of inequity and injustice.  But it is the          inevitable  result of so many of the items of production-C1) See Appendix, Table C.V&quot;) See Notes 7. 8 and 9. &apos;0s) Ministry of Labour Gazette.
          costs remaining fixed in terms of money that the residue          which forms the inducement to the business man, and is          of the order of only 17 per cent, of the whole, is reduced          to vanishing point. (&quot;)   24.  The result of all  this is that  money  costs interpreted  inthe widest sense are out  of line with money prices.  Consequently,producers  lose  money;  they are unable  to maintain  their formerlabour forces;  and unemployment ensues on  a colossal scale.(b) The Disparity  between  the Prices of  Primary  Products and                      Manufactured Goods.   25.  The foregoing  represent  the  maladjustments  which  arise if  a fall  in  prices  becomes  evenly  spread over  commodities  ingeneral.  For the time being, however, the outstanding feature ofthe economic situation is a disharmony of a different kind.   Theprices  of  primary  commodities,  e.g.,  agricultural  products andmetals, have fallen very  heavily, and  are now on the averagevery little above, while many of them  have fallen well below,  thepre-war level.   The prices of manufactured goods  have not  fallen in  anything like the same  degree.   The  result  is  an extremedisparity between the two sets of prices, which is quite incompatible with an active condition of world trade.  So long as the industrial interests  of  the world  attempt  to  charge   anything  like  the prevailing prices for the manufactured  goods  they  produce,  whileoffering only the prevailing prices for primary products, it is clearthat  the  primary  producers  will only be  able  to  purchase  adiminished  quantity of  manufactured  goods.   Until  new markets for these  goods are found or newr types of  goods produced insteadof  them and  this  must take  a  considerable  time industrialunemployment  on  a large  scale must  prevail.    Partly  as  a.result of  this,  the  prices of manufactured goods are likely to fall,under the pressure of  competition  between  cpmpeting  manufac-turers and competing manufacturing  countries.  In  all industrial countries  there is bound to be  a strong  movement  towards thereduction of  costs by  every available  means,  which will  almost certainly  include a lowering of salaries and wages.   It  is indeedevident that in  many countries such a  movement is  already well.under way.(15)    26.  It  may therefore prove that we are only now approaching the phase of the world depression which  is really critical  for an industrial country like  Great Britain.   If manufacturing costs  ofproduction are cut drastically throughout the  world,  it will  not be prudent,  or indeed possible, for  us to abstain from joining  in  the general movement.  For if we do abstain,  we shall run a serious danger of  seeing  our  already  precarious  hold upon the  export markets  of the world weakened to a disastrous degree.    27.   At the same time it is evident that an international price- cutting and  wage-cutting contest is something to be looked forward to with great alarm and to Be avoided if it is by any means possible. If other  countries  cut  wages, the effect on  the value  of  money throughout the  world must be such that we shall  be compelled to follow suit  sooner or later.  But  it would be a far better way out for everyone if the route  back towards equilibrium was not  sought in this direction, but rather by raising the prices of staple commodities- ties so as to  make wage  cuts  less necessary.   We think that the most  strenuous effort should be made for international co-operation to this end, precisely because, failing such an effort, we fear that a wage-cutting campaign amongst the leading industrial countries is a  real possibility  and  may  prove a serious menace to  social stability.    IY.-REMEDIES  OF  AN EXTERNAL  CHARACTER.   28.  It will be clear from the foregoing analysis that the future course of world prices is a matter of the very first importance forGreat Britain.   A  speedy and  sufficient recovery of world prices         (&apos;*) Bowley and Stamp, &quot;The National Income, 1924.&quot;          (I5) See Appendix, Table J.

 would go a long way towards providing a solution of our difficulties. On the  other hand, if world prices fall further in  the near future, or after a brief and partial recovery, resume  a downward trend, the strain upon the economic  system of  Great Britain, as well as of many other countries, may become well-nigh intolerable.    29.  We  believe that monetary conditions  play a dominating part in  determining the course of world prices over a long period. In  the  circumstances which obtain to-day,  monetary conditions depend  upon  the  production of&apos; gold, its distribution among  the different countries, and  the  prevailing practices of Central Banks relating to its  use.   The facts with regard  to the supply of  gold have recently  been surveyed  by a Committee appointed by  the Economic and  Financial Section of the  League of Nations,  and we do not propose to  enter  into  the question in any detail.  Our conclusions. are :       (i)  that on the  whole  and, having  regard to the prevailing           practices of  certain foreign Central  Banks, the facts are          not such as  to encourage optimism;     (ii)  that on the other hand there is no insufficiency in  the total          supply of gold, provided  that it is  used  with reasonable          economy, and  with clue regard to the needs of the world          situation by Central  Banks; and    tiii)  that accordingly  the  problem is one which turns upon the          policies  which  Central Banks  pursue,   and upon  the          possibility of inducing them to  act  together with  the          object of securing a reasonable  degree of  stability, at an          appropriate level, in the  purchasing power  of gold.    30.   The matter is  not one in  which it is possible for any singlecountry  acting alone to accomplish  much.  Some influence we canexert, but a great deal more might be  accomplished  by  the federal reserve  System of the United States joining the Bank of england to take  drastic  action  on a common plan.   It is further  perhapspermissible to hope that under  the  pressure of  the  world trade depression and  the gradual extension of  its detrimental reactions to countries  which have not hitherto felt its effects  in a severedegree,  the   psychological  atmosphere   may  shortly  becomefar. more  favourable  than  it is  at present  to  more  general co-operation among Central Banks, preferably through the agency of the Bank for International Settlements.   81.   The most urgent need at  present is of a different characterfrom  the measures  which would  have been required,  prior to  therecent fall of  prices, to avoid an  undue fluctuation in the  level ofprices.   The difficulty  at the moment is not  a  general scarcity of short-term credit for first-class borrowers.  It arises, in the firstplace, because  such borrowers are  reluctant  to enter upon newenterprise in an atmosphere of a  falling price-level.  It is due, inthe second place, to the decline of the standing  of many borrowersin the opinion of lenders, because the dislocations  entailed by  theworld t depression have given rise  to  widespread  distrust  of  the stability  of the financial and currency systems of several countries.Notable instances at the present time are most  of the countries ofSouth America, Australia,  China and several of the  countries of central Europe.   82.   The.first obstacle  to the revival  of  enterprise might  be diminished by the  favourable reaction, both on the willingness oflenders  to convert  short-term credit into  long-term credit  and  onthe willingness of borrowers to engage in new enterprise, that would follow joint action on the part of the  Central Banks directed  towardscreating  in  the  minds  of financiers a strong conviction that  thepresent easy  terms for  short-term credit are likely  to continue fora long time to come.   33.   A second objective of co-operation between  Central Banksmight be to  allay  and remove the distrust now felt  towards  thegeneral credit of the group of  countries that we have mentionedabove, by forming a large joint pool for approved loans or  in someother way.   There is  real danger,  as matters are now tending,that the severity -of the  world depression may be  increased and
 its duration prolonged by a renewal of the currency debacles of the early post-war period.  It would lie outside our province to pursue tliis matter  in further detail  since the  whole  question is of  a difficult  and  delicate  character  in  which  international political complications and dangers  play an important  part;  but we desire to  record our  conviction  that the  chance  of a speedy recovery in world  trade will turn in  large measure upon  whether or not  it is possible  to restore a feeling of confidence  in the  financial stability of  those many countries which  are now the subject of distrust.    84.   At the present  time, the  international situation is  so disastrous, that the  time may be approaching when some more far- reaching effort  at  international  co-operation  than  has  been considered hitherto  may be  imperatively demanded.   The social and economic  systems of many parts  of  the  world  are unable to support  the present monetary chaos, without  breakdown and  civil dissension. Y.-WAYS OP RESTORING ELASTICITY TO THE ECONOMIC              STRUCTURE OF GREAT  BRITAIN.    35.   Not much  that this country acting  alone can do in  the economic sphere will  materially accelerate world recovery.   It is one of  the  inevitable consequences of  our  position in the world economy that, while our  absence  of prosperity may be of our  own making,  our prosperity must  wait on  world  conditions.  On  the whole, we gain much  more than we lose from the intimate nature of our international  connections; and it is  reasonable to accept this dependence as  a not  too  exorbitant price for the benefits that it provides.    86.   But,  while  the influence that we can exercise on the world is limited, it  is clear  that  what action  we take to meet our local difficulties must depend,  in part, upon  our estimate of the  course of world  conditions.  If then we cannot  rapidly reverse the external tendencies responsible for our local disequilibrium, it  is the more incumbent upon us to do  what we can to remove  the local disabili- ties of adaptation.    87.   No very satisfactory  measures  have yet been proposed for the  direct control of rings and monopolies.   But in  the past this country has been backward  in giving full publicity to the working of such bodies.   The experience of the Board of  Trade  Committee on Trusts might well be reviewed.  Business  interests have nothing to lose from  the maximum  publicity,  except  possibly  where inter- national rivalries are  involved.    88.   No direct Government action,  short of the introduction of methods  of coercion, can  do  much to  remove  trade  union restrictions.  This is a matter for action by employers and workmen in  the  industries  concerned.   The   demarcations   and  trade customs,  which  grew   up  in  an   environment  when  inter- national   competition   was  not  so  intense  and   when  there -was more slack in the  productive machine, are  now entirely inappropriate and inimical to the interests  of the working classes as a whole.  Cotton operatives, for instance,  who resist the introduc- tion of the  eight loom system, may be safeguarding indeed their immediate  interests,   but   they  are   only  intensifying  the difficulties of the industry.  In such circumstances it is the general body of wage-earners who are necessarily the chief sufferers.    89.   We are convinced that  there are, many ways in which theefficiency of the labour force could be increased without any changein its actual  skill, in  the sense of becoming more valuable to the employer and  therefore  more  worth the existing wage,  merely by  the  removal of  artificial restrictions.   We know  that tradeunions attach  great importance  to  restrictive provisions,  whichhave  often  been  hardly  won  and  sometimes  represent  a  realcontribution to the amenities of working  conditions;   40.  But if  they would  agree to reopen  the  whole questionof restrictions  all  along  the  line  and  consider  afresh  with
;an open mind what it is really reasonable and desirable to enforcein  the  actual conditions of to-day in the interests  of labour as awhole, and not merely of one union taken in isolation, there mightbe a surprising  increase in  the  effective output of labour and,consequently, in the  ability of  the  employer to offer  increasedemployment  at the existing wage.    41.   It is,  however, open to  the  Government to undertake a systematic reform of the whole system of  unemployment insurance;and this is  urgently  required in the public  interest.   There  isno doubt that  this system,  designed as  it  was with  the  mostbeneficent intentions, is now gravely abused.  This system impedesmobility from industry to industry.   It encourages the adoption of methods  for  meeting  fundamental  industrial  change,  such   asshort-time (appropriate only to short-time fluctuations), which tendto  aggravate the disease it was intended  to cure.  It conduces toan artificial rigidity of wage-rates and it constitutes a definite  tax on employment.YI.-Y/AYS  OF  INCREASING  INDUSTRIAL  EFFICIENCY,   42.   Under  the  head  of  industrial  efficiency  come  measures designed to improve industrial organisation and technique.  A vastamount of attention  has been  given in recent years to the problemsof industrial reconstruction, with particular reference to the de-pressed staple industries;  various official inquiries  have been heldresulting in many practical suggestions as to the lines along whichimprovement  should be  sought.   We do  not  regard  ourselves asqualified to offer any useful suggestions upon these matters, whichare essentially of a  technical  character,  though we are disposed tosuggest that  from  the standpoint of the ultimate  prosperity ofBritish economic life  the  efficiency  of industries  which  areexpanding or are capable of expansion  deserves  to  be regardedas of no less importance  than the efficiency of industries which areencountering serious difficulties.   It  is clearly of vital importance that everything possible should  be done to  keep British industryefficient  and up to  date.   But the main  question which presentsitself in  the present inquiry is how far such measures can sufficeas a remedy for  the troubles analysed in the previous Sections.For  the  most  part improvements  in  industrial methods  andtechnique are being adopted, and are likely to be adopted, aboutas fast by  our principal competitors as by ourselves, and, so faras this is true,  though it  remains of cardinal  importance that weshould not  lag behind, we are not likely to secure much positiveamelioration of our competitive position under this head.  Moreover,it is necessary to remember that many of the changes which areincluded to-day under the  vague term  &quot;rationalisation&quot;  are not of a kind  calculated to increase  productivity or employment.  Itis, for example, an  important purpose of many so-called rationalisation -sation  schemes  to arrange an orderly contraction of output in adeclining  industry with a  minimum  of  financial loss  to  the firms concerned.  This is, speaking generally,  a desirable objective, butit is not calculated to make any  direct contribution to the problemof unemployment.   A further consideration to be borne in mindis that in  so far as  improved industrial  technique takes the formof the introduction  of labour-saving  machinery, which it  is onlyprofitable  to  introduce  because wage-rates  are  uneconomicallyhigh, they will involve a temporary aggravation of unemployment,except to the extent that it is mitigated by a temporary stimulus to the industries manufacturing  the  labour-saving machinery.   48.   Altogether,  therefore, we are  driven to the  conclusionthat industrial reconstruction cannot supply in itself a completesolution  to  our serious economic  difficulties.   We say this  without-wishing in  the  least to  minimise the supreme importance  to theeconomic well-being of  Great Britain  of pressing forward well-considered  schemes  of  industrial reconstruction to the utmost inour power.  In the difficult economic conditions which now confrontus we can  ill afford to carry the burden of remediable  industrialinefficiency.
YII REDUCTIONS IN DOMESTIC MONEY WAGES.                    (a)  The Export Industries.    44.   Throughout the last few years the money cost of productionof British  goods has been maintained at- a level which has made itdifficult for British industry to keep its hold upon the world markets.We are, indeed, very  far from  supposing that the whole  blame forour exporting difficulties is attributable to excessive costs of produc-tion; nor do we take  the  view  that the  largest  possible volume ofexjtorts should be  the  main objective  of economic policy.   Variouscircumstances, which  have nothing  to do with British money costs of production, such as those  referred to in paragraph 9  (c)  above,-have exerted an adverse influence on British exports since the War.Moreover,  even where a decline in our exports is attributable to thefact that we have been losing  ground  to competitors,  it does  notnecessarily follow  either that excessive costs were the essential causeof the decline or that  the reduction  of our costs  (otherwise than bymeans of  increased efficiency)  is a desirable remedy.   As  indus-trialisation spreads throughout  the world, industrial countries witha low standard of living naturally tend to displace older  industrial countries like ourselves in  those forms of manufacture which  do  notcall for a very high degree of skill  or for  highly trained technicalstaffs.   Doubtless in  such cases, if we were to  cut  wages progres-sively, as the new  competition developed, we could hold on to a larger share of the world&apos;s trade  for some time.  But such a policy wouldbe foolish and in the long  run hopeless.  It  is better to let go those branches of trade  which are marked out by  technical circumstances as the natural field of newer industrial countries, and to seek com-pensation by  concentrating more on  other  industries in  which wehave  greater relative advantages.   45.   The volume of our exports  in 19-29 was about 10 per cent.less than in 1913.(16)  The largest part of this decline was probablyattributable to causes of the type discussed above.  Even so, the lossof export trade confronts us with awkward problems of readjustment,because some of the principal exporting industries which have beenlosing ground are  highly localised industries whose workpeople can-not move easily to other occupations.    But the problem so far is essentially  one of readjustment, not of national decline.  There isno strict necessity for  us to maintain an export trade of the pre-wardimensions in order to  purchase the  foodstuffs  and raw  materials which we must obtain  from abroad.   46.   Unfortunately, even before  the slump, there was reason tobelieve that the selling prices of British goods were  above a properlycompetitive level not only in trades which we must expect to see passin the course  of time  to new competitors, but over a wide range of trades which  are  pre-eminently proper  to  an advanced  industrialnation.   In the light  of the world depression these  misgivings  are necessarily deepened.   From 1925 to  1929 our total exports  tendedon the whole to increase, if only at a  disappointing rate,  and it had seemed reasonable to conclude that the danger of a further absolutedecline was not serious.  But the present depression reminds us thatthe years 1925-1929 were years  of activity for world trade as a whole and suggests that, taking  good  years  and bad years of world tradetogether, our  total exports may be  still  declining not merely rela-tively to those of other countries but  absolutely as well.   47.   Although we  do not consider that  an  export trade  of  thepre-war  dimensions   is  an  indispensable  necessity  for  Britisheconomic life, the  maintenance of an export trade upon a substantial scale is  certainly  essential to us.  There are moreover  no Britishproducts of  which  we have  anything in the nature  of a  worldmonopoly  and  which  we  can  therefore be  sure   of   sellingindependently of  the  price we  charge.   The  maintenance of asubstantial export trade requires in  the long run  as an essential condition that our costs of production should be comparable withthose of our  competitors  in  world  markets.  We  entertain  grave   0C) Board of Trade Journal and information given in the Report of the balfour Committee on industry and Trade.
 doubts  whether over  the  greater  part  of  industry  that  condition is  fulfilled to-day.   Just  as it  takes a long  time  either  for  an individual business or for a country to establish  a commanding position in the markets of the world,  so it takes a long time either for an  individual business or a nation to lose  that position once it has been  established, but  the process of decline  if it gets to a certain point is apt to develop more rapidly in  its later stages.  In the situation revealed and aggravated by the world  depression, the danger that we may see our export trade dwindle  to a disastrous point, unless we can  secure a substantial  reduction of our money costs of production, is one we can  no  longer afford to disregard.                      (b)  Home Industries.    48.   Nor is it  only in the export industries  that the  wage situation is important.  It is plain that, other  things being  equal, the quantity of employment in home  industries could be increased if wage-earners there were prepared to accept lower money rates of wages.   How  large  a percentage  of wage-reduction,  whether  in general  or in particular industries, would be required to evoke  in the near  future a given  percentage  increase  in  the volume  of employment  we have found  ourselves  unable  to decide.   Never- theless,  we must not under-estimate the advantages to employment generally which would ensue from wage-reductions in some  of the more highly  paid sheltered industries.   Since such reductions would be  likely to reduce the cost of living,  they  would make it easier to secure any unavoidable wage-reductions in other directions.         (c)  Difficulties in  the Way  of  Wage  Reductions.     49.   One  of  the great practical difficulties of  attempting  to improve employment by means of wage-reductions is  the anomalous disparities which  exist at  present   between   wages  in  different occupations.   It is in the unsheltered industries which have  to sell their goods against foreign competition that the pressure towards wage-reductions will be strongest:  but in many  of those industries wages are already  unduly low in comparison with wages in other occupations.   On the other hand,  the industries where wage-rates are highest  relatively to the pre-war standard,  and where  wage- reductions would accordingly entail a lesser degree of hardship, are usually  sheltered industries  where the  wage-earners&apos;  bargaining position  is strong.  Nevertheless,  the case for  wage-reduction  on comparative  grounds in some of those  industries where the rates are  out  of  line   with  wages elsewhere  is   so clear  that we think an attempt  at  adjustment  could be amicably made.  But the friction  and ill-will which must  be aroused by any  general movement  towards  lower wages  will  be greatly  intensified   if the wage-earners are singled out as the only class  which is asked to make sacrifices.   The recipients of salaries and of interest, and of fixed  incomes generally, have  benefited just as much  as the wage-earners from  the fall in the cost of living.  So far as the case for wage-reductions rests on changes of price-level, we hold strongly that no general appeal should be made by industry to  its workpeople to accept lower wages without a proposal  at the same time for a commensurate reduction in higher  salaries  and  directors&apos; fees.   50.   It is desirable, however,  to  point  out  certain facts  whichare relevant to the  problem.  Since 1924, when the fall in the costof living is taken into account, real  wages in  Great Britain have increased on  the average by about 9 per cent.(17)  Moreover, one ofthe principal reasons why the cost  of living has not fallen so muchas wholesale  prices is precisely that money wages have not fallenappreciably.   If money  wages  were now to  fall,  it  would  be reasonable to expect some offset to this in a reduction in  the costof living.  So long as rents  remain at their  present  level, theamount of this  offset  may be disappointing, but we would judgethat it   would be  equivalent  to  not less than one-fifth  of thereduction of  wages.  Thus if money  wages were now to fall evenby as much as 10 per cent, on the average, the result would be  toleave real wages somewhat higher than they were in 1924, so long                    (17) See Appendix, Talilo H.
as the prices of primary products remain near their present level.In the face of continually falling prices, no country can prudentlymaintain  the  principle that  money  wage-rates  are  sacrosanctindependently of their  relation  to real  wage-rates.   51.  To  sum up     (i)  Existing   money  wage-rates  cannot  be   regarded  as          sa,crosanct in a world subject to  violent changes in the          value of money.    (ii)  Certain  wage   adjustments  in  the  downward  direction,          particularly in sheltered industries  whose  existing wages          are  out  of   line  with  wages  in  other  comparable          industries, are desirable now.   (Hi)  If world prices  fail  to recover to a materially higher level,          general  wage-cuts in this  country  (or  their equivalent)          will become inevitable, because the failure of the price-          level to recover will probably mean that such wage-cuts          have been made elsewhere.   (iv)  But, on the other hand, as we have said in paragraph 27, it          would be unwise  for this country to lead the way with a          general wage-cut  or to encourage an  incipient world          movement in this direction.    (v)  In view of the immense practical difficulties of any general          reduction in  money wages, every other remedy with any          serious balance of argument in its favour should be tried          first.   (vi)  Furthermore, if a general wage-cut becomes inevitable, it          is  most desirable that it should be undertaken as part of          a wider scheme for re-settling money incomes generally          (including rentier incomes in particular), and not wages          alone.              VIII. SUBSIDIES  TO  WAGES.   52.  The effect upon unemployment of a general subsidy tomoney wages is primd facie the  same as that of an  equal propor-tionate reduction in money wage-rates.   Should it prove possible by  a low  rate of  subsidy  to  absorb  a  large  number  of  theunemployed, it  might happen that  the  whole cost of the subsidy would be off-set by  the associated  reduction in  the  amount ofunemployment benefit. (ls) In  this event,  if the wage-earning classesdid not, in consequence  of the subsidy, demand and  secure higher rates of money  wage, unemployment would be much reduced  andno off-setting  disadvantage would occur.   It  would, however, be highly optimistic to suppose either that  a  general wage  subsidy atany  given rate would in fact  reduce the volume  of unemploymentsufficiently to pay for itself out of unemployment benefit, or that,if it did so,  the  wage-earners would  refrain  from  demandingincreased rates of wage.  Hence in  practice it is to be feared  thatthis  policy,  if the  subsidy  were at  all substantial, would  involvea heavy  additional charge on the Budget  even when allowance ismade for savings on the Unemployment Insurance Fund ; and in thepresent state of  the national finances there can be no doubt that thiswould have  very unfavourable repercussions.   Moreover, a  generalsystem of wage subsidies would appear to many persons as a plungeinto the abyss; and business confidence might be so shaken  that employment would suffer through that cause an indirect injury muchgreater  than any direct gain that  might  fall to  it.  We  are ofopinion,  therefore, that a policy of  general wage  subsidies is not one  that ought  to be adopted.   58.   We therefore  turn  to  proposals  for a  system of wagesubsidies in respect, not of all wage-earners, but of  additional wage-earners whom employers would undertake to  engage with the  help of the subsidy.  On the assumption that an unemployed man costs the  State one pound a week, to bring him into work by means ofa subsidy would be a clear gain  all  round, so long as the requiredsubsidy  was anything less than a  pound.  Moreover,  under  this   (18) The present cost of unemployment bonefit is  now about 7&amp; per cent., of the.0 wages of the insured population.
  IX. WAYS OF INCREASING BUSINESS CONFIDENCE.   55.  An improvement  in  the  state  of  business  confidencewoidd  lead to  greater  readiness  to  hire labour  for  a  futurereturn.    Business   men  would borrow  more  both  on   shortterm  and  on long.   Indeed,  an  improved  state  of  confidencewould  help  employment  in  two  ways;  it  would  raise  theterms on  which  borrowers  would think it  worth  while  to borrow,and it would lower the terms on which lenders would be ready  to accommodate British enterprise.  Thus,  the  money that  peoplesaved would be utilised  in real investment; the  price level mightrise in some measure; activity in one field would  stimulate activity in others.  Once the movement started unless  subjected to someviolent jar it would advance under its own  momentum.   If thedevelopment of confidence in this country is not accompanied by asimilar development  elsewhere,  then, in consequence of the relativerise in the price-level here, a  tendency might be set up for gold to flow abroad.  If this  should happen it  would, in our view,  bevitally important that the Bank of England should be prepared  to suffer a  substantial  loss of  gold rather  than check the upward movement too soon by enforcing an advance in short money-rates.   56.  The best means of  restoring business confidence is  apsychological problem on which the opinion of this Committee is not likely to be specially valuable.  In the  long run we  do not see howsystem there would  be less prospect of wage-earners demandinga rise in money wages, and much less shock to business confidencethan  might be  looked for  with a  general  wage  subsidy.   Thedifficulties in the way of a scheme of this type  are, however, verygreat:    (a) In competitive  industries it  is well-nigh impossible to say          for any length of time what is the  number of employees          actually additional to the number that would have been          in employment, without the subsidy.   (b) Moreover, the  employers who are successfully marketing          their product without the subsidy may rightly urge that          the subsidy is really a bounty to the less  efficient.   (c) If the increased output caused through the subsidy can only          be marketed at a lower price as must often be the case           the  unsubsidised  businesses  find  their position and          margin of profit  actually worsened.   (d) Even  if the number of  additional  employees at work were          constant or determinable,  they would not be  necessarily          continuously in the  same  businesses,  since according  to          the  fluctuations of the  fortunes of different individual          businesses the claim to be  employing some of the surplus          qualifying   for   subsidy   would   be  shifting   and          indeterminate.   54.  It may  be that  in particular cases these difficulties  couldbe overcome and a workable scheme  could be devised in which the disadvantages  were at  a minimum and  the advantages  to employ-ment at  a maximum.   If and where this is so,  it  appears to themajority of us (Mr. Keynes, Professor Pigou and Sir Josiah Stamp)that  the case for wage subsidies in respect of additional employeesat a rate less than  the present rate of  unemployment pay is astrong one.  We  have not investigated any particular proposals under  this head.   One  of  us,  however  (Mr.   Henderson),  is  ofopinion that it would be impossible to frame any scheme of subsidieswhich  would not by its repercussions do  more  harm than  good,and holds strongly that the path of subsidies  to wages is one whichshould be avoided.  If attempted in  particular industries, subsidieswould need to be so  framed  that their temporary character was emphasised; and provision would need to be made for their gradualabolition in such a way as not to create disturbance.  subsidies to wages in particular  industries, as a permanent system, are,  inour view, highly undesirable.   Moreover, it  must be rememberedthat  any  system of subsidies, whether general or particular,  isdifficult to administer without  risk of abuse.
business confidence is likely to be maintained otherwise than by an actual recovery of business profits.  This means that, if business andemployment   improve  for  other  reasons,   the   effect  of   this improvement on business confidence may be cumulative; which is,indeed,  a part  of  the  justification of  emergency  measures  of  atemporary  character.   For  the  effect of  judicious  emergency measures  might be to  improve business confidence,  after whichbusines  confidence might take the place  of the  emergency measures as providing the  necessary stimulus.   57.  The ways of restoring business  confidence which have  been recommended in one quarter  or another  and seem to us  to  have some plausibility  may be  catalogued as  follows,-  without   ourexpressing any opinion  as to the quantitative effects to be expected from them or as to then general  desirability regarded merely asstimuli:    (a)  A solution of the  Budget problem satisfactory  to business          sentiment in particular, the  avoidance of increased          direct  taxation, the avoidance of any serious reduction         of  the Sinking Fund and the  avoidance  of increased          expenditure.   &apos;b)  A drastic reform of the system of Unemployment Insurance. .         It is widely felt that, if Parliament can suffer the present          monstrous anomalies of the Dole as they seem to be to         a wide consensus of public opinion without  trying to do          away with them, this must be symptomatic  of a general          unwholesomeness  in   the body  politic.   A  far-reaching         reform might  cause a great revulsion of feeling as showing          those fears to be groundless.   (c) A tariff on manufactured imports is recommended in some          quarters partly  on the ground that  it would supply  just          the stimulus (or, as others would contend,  the dope) which         business needs after the depression caused by losses partly         due to forces, such as the return to gold and the fall of          world  prices,  beyond its own control.  With the general          question of a tariff we deal later.   (d)  In general, any  remedies which  would improve  the prospect          of  earning profits  might also  be  classified  as  partly         producing their results through their effect  on business          confidence.    X.-WAYS OF  INCREASING  HOME  INVESTMENT.                       (a) Cheap  Credit.    58.  The amount of home investment, and so the volume ofemployment, would be  increased if the terms on  which borrowerscan be accommodated were made easier either through a reductionin the rate of interest or an improvement of facilities in other ways.    59.  The most general effect in this direction would be produced by  a credit policy on the  part  of the Bank of England to make-bank-credit as  cheap  and abundant as possible.  The difficulty is,of course,  that the Bank of  England cannot, under  gold-standardlimitations, move far in this  direction, unless other Central Banksdo  the  same.    Some  of  us  consider that  an important  causeof existing  unemployment is to be found in the fact  that  world conditions  in   combination  with  the requirements  of  the  goldstandard have  enforced on the  Bank of  England in recent years a credit policy  which has kept the  volume of domestic investmentbelow what it would otherwise have been.   60.  In recent months short-term rates of interest have fallen toa low level.  Probably we have not yet experienced the full  benefits-of this;  for capital projects  take a long  time to  mature and theamount of those  actually afoot  is still under the  influence of theabnormally high  rates of 1929.  But it  is particularly noticeablethat, so far, the  reduction of short-term rates of interest is only very slightly  reflected  in  long-term rates which  are  of  muchgreater significance to borrowers for  fixed investment.
    61.  We consider that a policy on the part of the Treasury andthe banking  system intended to  bring down  long-term  rates  ofinterest, even if it meant some raising of short-term rates, would  be useful on balance as facilitating an increase of long-term investment.                 (b) Regulation of Foreign Issues.    62.  From time to  time  in  recent years  the  higher  rates  ofinterest  offered  abroad  as compared with those  which domesticinvestments are able to yield  have given rise  to a pressure towardslending money abroad instead of at home.   In such conditions, theeffect  of  high world rates of interest under  a gold standard hasbeen to put the domestic rate above the rate  at which enough newdomestic  investment can come into existence.  If our exports werelow enough in price and in sufficient  demand  abroad, great activity in  the foreign loan market or in buying foreign investments wouldreflect itself to a practically equal extent in increased exports.  Butif this economic outlet is not  available owing to the position  of our export trade, then a state of disequilibrium is created, which,  again,by increasing rates of home interest, accentuates the difficulty.  Theonly method of restoring equilibrium so far  adopted has been an embargo on foreign lending in  London or a kind of informal rationing of foreign borrowers, but this  has hitherto been ineffective and opento  objection in  practice.   The harm that arises  when  there  is a difference between the capacity to lend abroad and the capacity  to export, or because  increased foreign lending cannot be reflected  indiminished imports, might perhaps be mitigated by certain special measures.  The control  already exercised by the Bank of Englandover the  rate of new foreign issues may operate to some  slightextent to avoid exceptional pressure at inconvenient times.   Butit is easily evaded.  Bonds issued on  foreign  markets find their way to the London market,  without having paid British  stampduty and  contrary to the wishes of those responsible for the regula-tion of the British market. We think that a distinction might bemade  between  foreign  bonds officially admitted  to the Britishinvestment market (perhaps by the Treasury on the recommendationof the  Bank of England) and those not so admitted, income derivedfrom the  latter being subject  to a special income tax.                 (c) Subsidies and Public Works.    63.   The  next  possibility   under  the   head  of  increasinghome-investment   is  that   of  promoting   useful   schemes   ofcapital  development,  either   by  pressing   forward  such   work.as  lies within the direct control of  the Government,  or by theoffer of  State  subsidies  to  local authorities  and  public  utilitycompanies.  Under  conditions of  extensive unemployment such  asprevail to-day, and have prevailed in lesser degree for some  years,we are convinced that  what  we may term the policy of  &apos;&apos; publicworks &quot;  is, in principle, a sound  policy for  the  State  to pursue.We do not accept the view that the undertaking of  such  work mustnecessarily  cause  a mere  diversion from other employment.  Onthe  contrary,  we think  it improbable that  public  works,  whichcomply with the conditions which  we detail below, involve during a trade depression any important degree of diversion  from  employ-ment in  ordinary industry.  Apart from any  such possible off-set,the  effect of public works in  increasing employment  is, of course,not necessarily or even often confined to the number  of workpeopledirectly engaged upon  them.   They entail an increased  demandfor the services  of the industries which supply the materials used;and the  increased  purchasing power of the workers  employed inthese  ways has further  beneficial repercussions  upon trade ingeneral.   There accrues, accordingly,  an important saving to  public funds  in  the  shape of  reduced  expenditure  on unemploymentbenefit, as well as some increase in the yield of the general revenue,which  makes  it good business, even from the standpoint of theBudget,  to  pay  subsidies  amounting  to  a  considerable percentageof the cost  of the work  (say  at least, one-third) provided that the-effect of the subsidies is  to secure that work is put in hand,  whichwould  not otherwise be undertaken.
    64.  We think it desirable to stress  these  considerations  lest disillusionment with  the apparent results of the public works policy of  recent  years should encourage the  belief  that  experience  has demonstrated that a  programme of public works is disadvantageous rather  than advantageous to employment.   No policy of public works can, of  course, outweigh the effects of a world slump of the magnitude of the present one.  But we are of opinion that unemploy- ment would stand to-day at a decidedly higher level, if the  Govern- ment a year ago had attempted to cut down road programmes  and development work generally instead of pressing  them forward.    65.  On the other hand, it is important to  recognise that public works can  only be justified if certain conditions are fulfilled.   In the first place, the works  in question must really be of a useful and productive character.  To  undertake costly projects of no or only a negligible  value merely for the  sake of  providing  employ- ment would be an absurdly wasteful proceeding.  Indeed, inasmuch as  the projects would  necessarily  consume a  great  deal of useful materials,  this would be  more wasteful than it would be  to  pay the unemployed full  wages for doing nothing.  Secondly, works which are  to be of assistance in mitigating unemployment in times of  bad trade,  must  be capable of being put  into  operation   and carried out with  speed.   Unfortunately,  however,  the works  for which there is  the strongest  ease, from the point  of view  of their social and economic utility,  are often  of  a  kind which it is. extremely  difficult  to get  going  quickly, while, on  the other hand, the utility  of  projects which it  is comparatively easy to set in hand  without  delay  is often  extremely dubious.  Thirdly,  the works must be of  such a nature as not to  create later on a  difficult &quot;demobilisation&quot;  problem.  A programme of public works which consists mainly of heavy  outdoor navvying work  is exposed to a real weakness  under  this head.   Such works necessarily  employ a  larger proportion  of men of the  lower  age groups than  the average industry.  They are apt, moreover,  to entail  the undue- stimulation of the demand for certain kinds of  materials.  Fourthly, as regards  those works which are subsidised but not directly under- taken by  the   State, it  is  obviously  important,  but  difficult  in practice to  ensure, that the subsidies  are  not  paid for work which would have been undertaken in any ease.    66.  Finally, the scope and  scale of  the programme  as  a whole- must be such  as to commend itself as reasonable and  sensible to public  opinion.   A  hastily  improvised  programme  of  dubious projects, which was  widely regarded as  wasteful and profligate, and raised  doubts as to the general soundness of the public finances, might have serious reactions, for  example, on the rate  of  interest at which the Government  could borrow.   While, as  we have said, we  do not  believe that employment created by  public works need involve a diminution of resources devoted to  private investment, it might easily do so, if it  took a form which aroused apprehension as to the stability  of the public credit.    67.  The above conditions necessarily set  limits to  the extent to  which  it is  possible to  meet unemployment by  the policy of public works.                        XI. TARIFFS.    68.  We approach the  expedient of Tariffs  from the  standpoint.of economists who, at all times previous to the present emergency, have been  strongly opposed to them.   We accept, that is  to say, the validity of  the traditional Free Trade argument.    The central economic argument for Free Trade may be expressed as follows:     69.  In normal conditions, when there is no chronic abnormalunemployment,  the effect of a tariff must mainly be to divert  the productive  forces of the community from one occupation to another,and not to  increase their total activity.  It has  been usual to admit that special cases  can be  imagined \e.g.,  infant industries  or  keyindustries)   where   there  may be  advantages  in  the  deliberatediversion of production out of its  &apos;&apos; natural&apos;&apos;  channels by tariffs.
or otherwise.   But  as  a rule  there  will be a strong presumption that tariffs of the kind which  are imposed in  practice will tend to divert production from  the  channels  where we are  relatively nioreefficient into channels where we are relatively less efficient;  thatis to say,  the play of natural forces  will be more successful indiscovering the occupations  in w-hich  wre can employ ourselves mostprofitably,  than  any  system of  tariffs  will be.   This  will  be particularly the case as time goes by.  A tariff is apt to be inelasticand  not easily changed in accordance with changing circumstances.The older but less profitable industries will cry out  successfully for protection which will enable them to  retain productive forces which otherwise would be finding their way into newer and more profitableindustries.   Moreover,  in so far  as the  productive forces of  thecountry  are occupied  in  protected  trades  where their  relativeefficiency is less  than it is  in certain other trades, the  effect  willbe seen in a higher cost of living relatively to  the money-wages,and  consequently in a lower standard of life.                   (a) Advantages of a Tariff.    70.   The question we have to face to-day is the extent to whichthis historic argument is invalidated for  the time being by (i) theexistence of  chronic  large-scale  unemployment,  (ii)  the  doubt whether we can hope materially to  expand or, even  to retain ourpresent favourable balance  of trade by means  of a moderate cut inour money costs without a restriction of imports, (iii) the possibility that the effect of a tariff on  the &apos;&apos; terms of trade &apos;&apos; might be greater in  present  circumstances  than  formerly,  and (iv)  whether the promotion of  economic solidarity within the  British Empire maynot be a safeguard against  the danger of economic isolation in the modern  world.            (i)  Chronic Large-Scale  Unemployment.    71.   Among economists this issue was,  before the War, mainlydiscussed without  reference to  the  possible  effects  of  protective duties upon the volume  of employment.   The popular idea that since,  subject to  certain reservations, exports are the price paid for imports,  it  is impossible that  these  duties  should  increaseemployment as a whole, was indeed no part of  the economist&apos;s stockin. trade.   It wras always  obvious  that  a  contraction  of importsmight be balanced in part  not by  a  contraction of exports, but byan expansion in  our purchases  of  foreign securities; it  was equally obvious  that  a contraction of imports  might  be equivalentto leaving abroad a larger part of  the  interest due on our existingforeign  investments  as  further  foreign  investment.   Even in sofar as  exports  were  contracted  it would  not follow that export industries must  be contracted to an  equivalent extent,  since  their-efforts might be turned to satisfying the needs of new men broughtinto the protected home industry.   But before the War, though,of  course,  unemployment  existed  and  was  sometimes  large in amount, nearly all of  it could be accounted  for  as  a  function ofprocesses of adjustment to which any lasting system of fiscal dutieswas irrelevant.  There was no large  intractable mass of uneniploy-ment associated with dislocations  between  costs and world prices:such as  has existed ever since the  post-armistice boom.   No doubt,even before the War,  a movable  system  of  import  duties, to beput on in bad times and removed in good, would have affected theemployment situation  favourably.   But, in  pre-war controversy,the protective tariff contemplated was  intended to be permanent tariffs to be imposed  and removed at short intervals being neverseriously debated; and there was at that time  at any rate  nounemployment  of  a  sort  relevant  to,   or capable   of  beingappreciably  affected   by,  this  policy.    For   this  reason  theunemployment issue was often left on one side in tariff discussions.The situation is now  fundamentally different.  There is, and hasbeen ever since the post-armistice  boom, an enormous mass of, soto  speak, chronic  unemployment,  associated  with  the  dislocationsdiscussed in  earlier  sections of this  Beport,  much exceeding in
-amount and different in type from that which prevailed before the War.   It is essential to inquire how far this new situation provides new arguments in favour of protective duties.    72.  In present conditions the imposition of reasonably devised protective duties  (though one of us (Professor  Pigou)  thinks that in practice it  might not be easy to devise them) that should exclude.a substantial portion of  the imports  that now compete with our home industries would, for some time to come,  directly increase the  aggregate  volume of  employment  in  this country, and  by so doing  would  set  up  repercussions  through  the  saving  on the  unemployment  benefit and  so  on,  that  would,  by indirect processes  increase  it  still  further.   The gain  would  probably be associated  with some  increase  in  the  cost of  living  and a corresponding  reduction  in real  wages and in  the  value of-inpney incomes generally; but since a main alternative remedy for unemployment; a reduction of money  wages must also involve an equal  or greater reduction of  real wages, this consideration  is not-of great weight.  The  important  question to decide is whether the direct effect, and therewith the indirect effects, of reasonably devisedprotective  duties in  increasing  the aggregate volume of employment would  be  large or  small.   The answer  to this question turns in:great part upon the  degree of adverse reaction which the contraction brought about in our  imports is likely  to produce on our  export industries.    73.  The  majority of us  (Mr. Keynes,  Mr.  Henderson  and Sir  Josiah  Stamp)  take   the  view  that in  present conditions the main  part of the reduction of  imports would be balanced for several  years by  increased  sales  to us  of   foreign  securities.If we  use  surplus capacity now out of  employment to make,  underthe protection of a tariff,  an article which we now import, the relief to the foreign exchanges may  enable the Bank  of England to relax.credit conditions,  with the  result that  there may be an increase offoreign  lending by  this country; so that the fruits  of the  labour of the  newly-employed surplus capacity go.to increase  the amountof the country&apos;s  foreign  wealth.  Or,  alternatively,  the  formerimports may  be partly replaced by imports of a different kind,namely, those which are needed to satisfy part  of  the  increased consumption of the newly-employed workers.   We return to these considerations below.   74.  One  of  us  (Professor  Pigou)  holds  that  the adversereaction  would  after  a  short  time  be  nearly commensurate with  the  original  contraction of imports.  His reasons  are asfollows.   In  so  far  as  the  price-level  was  raised  here,  our-export  industries  would  be directly   handicapped; in  so  far asimports or substitutes for them excluded from our market were driven to seek an  outlet elsewhere, these industries would be facedwith stronger competition in neutral markets.  Moreover,  the effect-of a reversion to protection on the part of this country  might well,in the present international situation, lead to a rise  in the  tariffsof other countries  and so  to a  still  further handicap upon our exports.  Yet again, in so  far as either home or export industriesuse imported  goods either as raw material? or machinery in theirown  work, these  home  industries  will  be vro  tanto  prejudiced.Professor  Pigou,   whilst  agreeing  that  the   present  abnormalemployment  situation  strengthens the case for protective  importduties  in  some  measure,  is not  prepared  to  admit  that itstrengthens it very  much.(ii) The Maintenance of Foreign Investment on an Adequate  Scale.   75.  If  the  view  of  the majority  on  this matter   (para-graph   73),  from  which  Professor  Pigou dissents,  is  correct,the  point is  very  important.   For  there  is  a  further  set of considerations, which formerly, perhaps, were  of small practicalsignificance,  but  may  be of  first-class  importance  to-day.    Webelieve that  it  is difficult  or  impossible  at the present time forGreat   Britain to employ  her productive resources  to  the best advantage without a somewhat large  proportion of foreign  invest-ment  to total savings.  Great  Britain  is an   old and  relatively
well-equipped country; and it is natural, therefore, that the outside-world  should  be  able to offer more  openings capable of yielding  ahigh rate of interest than can be found at home.  But if the volumeof savings  which is thus attracted towards overseas is greater than our favourable foreign balance of trade, the Bank  of England tends-to lose gold, with the result  that a  credit disequilibrium is set upwhich  is likely to have a most adverse effect on business profits and hence  on employment.  The only remedies are to be found either inan increase of home investment, the possibilities of stimulating whichwe  have already explored,  or  in an  increase of the  favourableforeign balance.   Some  of us find the  main reason of the  presentdisequilibrium of profits and employment, not so much in an undulyhigh standard of life, as in the fact  that the pressure of savings to-find an outlet abroad is  greater  than the amount of foreign invest-ment which corresponds to the balance of trade which we actuallyhave at present.   76.   Thus unless  something  occurs greatly  to increase  the-relative  attractions of home  investment, a substantial increase ofour favourable balance  of  trade may be. a necessary ingredient inany complete solution.   77.   Now  the favourable balance  of  trade can  be increasedeither  by increasing our exports  or by diminishing our imports.&quot;By  reducing our costs, and particularly by cutting our wages costs,we  can  increase the volume of our exports.  The  difficulties  ofmaking  sufficient  headway along  this line  are : (1) the resistance of the  workers towage reductions; (2) the prospect that our foreign competitors are likely, at any rate for a time, to meet any  cuts wemay make by cuts of their  own; and  (3) the  fact that  the valueof our  exports,  as distinct  from the  volume,  will  not  be much increased unless  the percentage increase in the volume of trade is-decidedly greater  than the percentage  reduction of prices (e.g., if.by cutting our prices 10 per cent.,  we only increase the  volumeof our exports 10 per cent.,  the value  of our exports is  no greaterthan it was before).   For a country  situated as  Great Britain is, itwould  be better  to  occupy our unemployed resources in  makingincreased exports, so far as  this is  possible on satisfactory  terms.But it  seems  obvious to some  of  us that, if we cannot overcome  thedifficulties of an adequate solution along these lines,  it is better to occupy our unemployed resources in  making goods to take the placeof goods we now import  than not to  occupy  them at  all.  For this-is just as effective a way of  increasing our power  to make foreigninvestments and to augment  employment as increasing our exports would  be.   Thus the question  arises and this  is not  merely  a.feature of  the immediate  crisis, but may  face us for some timeto come whether, assuming  that we have to find further employ-ment,  either  on making exports  or on making  goods  to  replaceimports, we   should not  rely  in  part on the  latter form ofemployment to supplement the, perhaps limited,  opportunities  forthe former.  At  any rate, in deciding where  lies the balance ofadvantage for or against a tariff,  this,  together with the existenceof large unused capacity in  plant,  machinery  and agriculture, isone of the factors which must be taken into consideration.   Withsome of us, indeed,  this has  been the decisive factor in convincing.us that the adoption of  some kind of generalised  tariff is, on  thewhole, advisable for such period as the  economic equilibrium is  outof gear  owing to our wage-levels not  having been adjusted to  a-rapidly reduced price-level.   78.   It has been put to us to give a concrete example that,assuming we  need an increase  of  50 million in our  favourable balance of trade, in order to  make foreign investments in countries-needing new  capital out of  British savings surplus to our own requirements, it  might be  to  the  national advantage and result ina higher standard of living,  if we were to set about achieving thisby facilitating the production at  home of, for example, iron andsteel products or pig- and poultry-products which we now  import,rather  than by  trying to  force out a  larger volume  of  our olderstaple  exports by competitive wage-cuts which  might be met,  forall  we know,  by  almost  equal cuts on the part  of our competitors..
 It should be  added that the argument for  a tariff  in such  cases would be partly of the &quot;infant industry&quot;  type, as well  as of the type  discussed above, inasmuch as the object  would be to select industries  which there  seemed good  hopes of our  being  able  to foster and expand.     79.   Moreover, this policy might also be to the advantage of the overseas countries which need our surplus savings for their further development.   In other words, it is better  in such  circumstances for the rest of the world, as well as for us, that our surplus capacity : should  be used to create wealth than that it  should lie idle;  for this will have the indirect effect of releasing resources  for the capital development of the overseas countries which most  need  them,  as well as of adding correspondingly to the foreign investments of this&quot; --country.                     (iii) The Terms of Trade. .     80.   Economists   have  always   recognised  that,  when  a -country imposes   taxes   upon  imports whether   imports  that compete  with  home   products  or   others it  will   in  some measure turn  the  real  terms  of  trade in  its favour;  that  is  to say,  it will cause a  unit  of  its  export goods  to  buy somewhat more import goods than before; or, in more  popular language, that in some measure it will make  the foreigner pay its import duties. Before  the War, for a number of reasons which it is not necessary to enumerate, it was,  however, generally  agreed that, so far  as this country was concerned, the gain that could be looked  for under this head was very small.   It was  likely,  moreover, to evaporate as time went  on,  being an advantage which we could  only snatch on  a scale worth having if we took the foreigner by surprise and before he had time to adapt himself to the new circumstances.   In present conditions, in view of the large amount of surplus capacity in the  iron and  steel and some other industries  abroad,  it may be  that a more substantial advantage  might be won.  Foreigners determined to  sell  in our  markets  might cut their  price  to match the duty.  It  must be observed, however, that, so far as they did this,  the volume of imports would not be reduced,  and, therefore, the advantages under the head of employment would  be  replaced by advantages to the Budget.                (iv) Danger of  Economic Isolation.     81.   Finally, it is necessary also to take  account of a considera- tion of  a vaguer character.   The tendency since  the War has been in  the direction  of an intensified  economic  nationalism,  and, despite the  counter-movement set on foot by the World Economic Conference  of  1927  and  the  succeeding  discussions  at  Geneva, that remains in practice the prevailing tendency.   It is  true that there is a growing realisation  throughout Europe of the  mischief caused  by this tendency,  but  the  signs are that this new mood, when  it gains  sufficient  strength,  will express itself rather  in agreements between neighbouring groups of countries to grant one another preferential tariff concessions, to which the outside  world is not admitted, than in a general reduction of tariff barriers.  This, indeed, is the principle which underlies  the  present project  of economic co-operation between the agrarian States  of Europe and which  also inspires  the  vaguer  project  of a  United States  of Europe.    82.   If agreements of this kind materialise, it may be possible for Great Britain to secure for her trade   the preferential terms accorded to each other by  the participating States in consideration of the fact  that we impose few duties upon their goods.   On the other hand, there  is a  manifest danger,  if such  agreements are entered into in some quarters, whilst elsewhere the  tariffs of  other countries are  becoming increasingly  high, that  we  may find ourselves in a dangerous  position of  economic isolation.   It may happen accordingly that our interests  may  best be safeguarded  by cultivating closer economic relations with the Empire and  seeking for  an extension&quot; of inter-Imperial trade, even if it were to prove to be at the expense of some loss of trade with the outside world.
 It  should  be added that the argument for a tariff in  such cases would be partly of the &quot;infant  industry&quot; type,  as well as of the type discussed  above,  inasmuch as  the object would be  to  select industries which  there  seemed  good hopes  of our being able to foster and expand.    79.  Moreover, this policy might  also be to the advantage of the overseas countries which need our  surplus savings for their further development.   In other words,  it  is better in such circumstances for the rest of the world, as well as for us,  that our surplus capacity:should be used  to create wealth than  that it should lie idle; for  this will have  the indirect  effect of releasing  resources for  the capital development  of the overseas countries which most need them, as well as of adding correspondingly to the foreign investments of  this country.                    fiii) The Terms  of  Trade.    80.  Economists   have  always   recognised   that,   when  a. country  imposes  taxes   upon  imports whether  imports   that compete  with   home   products  or  others it   will   in  some measure  turn the real  terms of trade in its favour;  that is to say,  it will cause a  unit  of  its export  goods  to  buy somewhat more import goods than before; or, in more popular language,  that in  some measure  it will make the  foreigner pay  its import duties. Before the War, for a number of reasons  which it is not necessaryto  enumerate,  it  was,  however, generally agreed  that, so far as this country was concerned, the gain  that could be looked for under this head  was  very small.   It was likely, moreover, to evaporateas  time went on, being an advantage which we could only snatch on a scale worth  having if we took  the foreigner by surprise  and before he had time to adapt himself  to the new circumstances.   Inpresent conditions, in view  of the large  amount of surplus capacity in  the iron  and steel  and some other  industries  abroad, it may be that a  more substantial advantage  might  be  won.   Foreigners determined to sell in our markets might  cut  their  price to match the duty.  It must be observed,  however, that, so  far as they did this, the  volume of imports would not be reduced,  and, therefore, the advantages  under the head  of employment would be replaced by advantages to the Budget.               (iv) Danger of Economic  Isolation.    81.   Finally, it is necessary also to take account of a considera- tion of a vaguer character.   The tendency since the War has been in  the   direction  of an  intensified  economic  nationalism, and, despite  the counter-movement set on  foot by the World Economic Conference of 1927  and  the succeeding discussions  at  Geneva, that remains  in practice the  prevailing tendency.   It  is true  that there is  a growing realisation throughout Europe of the  mischief caused by this tendency,  but the signs are  that  this new mood, when it  gains  sufficient  strength, will express  itself rather  in agreements between neighbouring groups of countries to grant one another  preferential tariff  concessions, to which the outside world is not admitted, than in a general reduction of tariff barriers. This, indeed,  is  the principle  which  underlies the present project  of economic co-operation between the agrarian  States of  Europe  and which  also inspires  the  vaguer  project of   a  United States  of Europe.    82.   If  agreements of this kind  materialise, it  may be possible for Great  Britain to secure for her  trade the preferential terms accorded to each  other by  the participating States  in consideration of the fact that we  impose few duties upon their  goods.   On the other hand, there is a manifest  danger, if such  agreements are entered into in some quarters, whilst elsewhere the tariffs  of other countries  are  becoming  increasingly high,   that  we may  find ourselves in a dangerous position of  economic isolation.   It may happen  accordingly that our interests  may best be safeguarded by cultivating closer economic  relations with the  Empire and seeking for an extension ,of inter-Imperial trade, even if it were to prove to be at  the expense of some  loss  of trade with the outside world.
    88.   At the  present  moment  the  Dominions,  largely  as the-result  of the  difficulties  caused by  the  world depression,  are inno  mood to abate their policies of national protectionism, and wedo  not consider  that  an increase  of preferences which takes theform of raising the duties against  imports from outside the Empirewithout  abating the tariffs  against our goods,  can  offer very sub-stantial  advantages to British trade.  We see no great probabilitytherefore at the moment of entering into any  fully satisfactory arrangements  with the Dominions, though we write without know-ledge  as to what  exact  arrangements  the  Dominions  might  be-prepared to offer as the result of  negotiations.    84.   It  is, however,  fair to  remember  that  the preferencesalready  accorded to us by  the Dominions without any  importanttariff quid pro quo are of very  real advantage to us.  Indeed, the-more our difficulties in world markets increase, the more  dependentdo  some  of our  staple industries such as textiles  become on the preferential markets  of the Dominions;  and  a withdrawal of allthe preferences now  granted  to us by the Empire  would undoub-tedly be a serious blow to British  trade.    85.   In those circumstances, though  we  have no basis for animmediate proposal,  we consider that the  development of  inter-Imperial  preference  may  very likely become a  wise  economic policy   for  Great  Britain,  and  this   possibility  weakens  the (resumption against  using  certain  types of  tariff  just  now  as  a means of temporary  relief  from our present difficulties.                   (b) Objections to a Tariff.    86.   On the  other side  of the  account,  there  remain  withunabated force certain arguments of a more general kind againsta tariff, namely :     (a) A tariff may  be a  means  of  snatching,  at  the  expense of          other countries, an advantage for ourselves which is not          so great as  the damage done to them; so that if every--          one plays the same game,  the world as a whole is worse          off.   The world would be richer  under a system of general          Free Trade than it- is.    (b) Governments dependent upon popular elections are certain          to impose protective duties, not on weak  industries that          may need  them, but rather on strong  industries  that          control numerous votes.    (c)  Once duties have been  imposed, vested interests are created:.          and it is difficult to  remove them when the need for them          disappears,  without  inflicting  considerable   incidental          hardship.    (d) So long as the  issue  of Protection versus Free Trade divides          political  parties,  duties are liable  to  be imposed or          removed  not  on  their  merits  but  according  to  the          exigency  of party  conflict, with the result that  indus-          industrialists are never certain  of their position and may be          diverted from the task of tackling their proper problems          to perpetual &quot; lobbyings &quot; in  pursuit of fiscal favours.          The more the prosperity of particular industries is made          dependent upon  Government action,  the  less  likely it is-          that  public  affairs  will  be conducted  with a  single  eye          to the  interests of the community as a whole.    87.   Different persons will weigh up  differently the balance ofadvantage or disadvantage resulting  from courses of action which,while probably increasing employment in the immediate future,would  also be open to these objections.   88.   These  issues  are not strictly determinable on  considera-tions of economic theory alone.  They must largely  depend on how long we expect  the  existing disequilibrium  to  last,  how seriouslywe  estimate the immediate  social  risks of a policy  which looks tothe more remote future for its reward,  how  seriously  we  regard&apos;the dangers of economic  isolation  if we reject  any  practicable-
appeal of  the  Dominions for closer  economic  co-operation,  howgreat an actual diminution of the national wealth will ensue in themeantime  if we do  nothing, how much  can  be expected fromalternative policies,  and  so  forth;  and, on  the other  hand,  how much ultimate damage we might do to our economic strength bydiverting our productive energies into channels  which may not bethe best in the  long run, how much  injury  we  may inflict on international ideals and the  cause  of  peace and amity  throughoutthe world,  how far the British national  character  and political lifeare likely to prove exempt from  the grosser evils of Protectionism.                         (c)  Conclusions.   89.  When we come to the question of particular schemes, wethink it important  to  distinguish sharply  between  two different types of tariff.(i)  Safeguarding.   90.  We  understand  by  safeguarding  duties  tariffs  imposedprimarily  for  protective  purposes  in  favour of  specially  selectedindustries.   We have already argued  above that a theoretical case may  exist  for  such duties,  especially when an argument of the&quot; infant industry &quot;  character is applicable.   But in  the actualconditions  of  Great Britain  to-day. we think  that  it is difficultto find exceptional eases of this kind.   91.  Apart  from  existing duties, there  is  no case amongstmanufactures, which appears  to us  to deserve serious consideration,except a tariff on iron and steel and their  products.  In this case,the majority of us  (Mr.  Keynes, Mr. Henderson  and Sir JosiahStamp)  are in favour  of protective duties in  the present  grave emergency, subject to the strict condition that the  industry shouldrationalise  itself in  accordance with an approved plan and that thetariff should be of a weight  and scope appropriate, not to presentconditions but to those which will exist after their reconstruction.   92.  One of us  (Professor Pigou) dissents  from  this proposalconcerning iron and steel on the following grounds :    (a) It would be impracticable to adopt this proposal without at          the  same  time not merely granting drawbacks  to export          industries that  use steel in their  work, but also somehow          compensating home industries  that do this.  From simple          beginnings an elaborate and complicated system of duties          or other compensatory arrangements would thus grow up.   (fe) The condition for  protection,  i.e., that the  industry should          undertake to rationalise itself, is not one that is capable          of being enforced; for the  industry is not an individual.          It might  even happen that, under the shelter of protec-          tion, inefficient firms would be  maintained and the process          of rationalisation actually impeded.   (c) A duty  of this character, though imposed  as a temporary          measure,  would prove in  practice,  when the  circum-          stances, in respect  of which the majority contemplate it,          have disappeared,  exceedingly difficult to  remove.   (d) If it be the fact that, in view of the heavy losses which it has          sustained,  the  industry  is  unable to raise  the capital          necessary to modernise its plant  and so do without some          form of Government assistance,  methods  of  assistance          other than those of a tariff are available.   98.  In the case of agriculture, it  has  been  put  to  us  thatpig-products  and  poultry-products  offer  an  important  field- forreplacing  imports by  home   production, and  the  majority of us(Mr. Keynes, Mr. Henderson and Sir Josiah Stamp) think that thecase should be seriously examined.(ii) A Revenue Tariff.   94.  A  comparatively low tariff  (say 10 per cent.) covering widecategories of imports without  discrimination, either on manufacturedgoods or manufactured goods  and  food,  and designed  to mitigate the conditions of general disequilibrium now existing, rather than
to favour particular industries, can be supported by arguments whichare not applicable  to safeguarding duties.    95.  The majority of us  (Mr. Keynes, Mr. Henderson and SirJpsiah Stamp)  think  that a sufficient case exists for  such a tariff,having regard  to  the various considerations discussed above,  tothe Budgetary  problem, any  relief to which is  obviously  of greatimportance, and  to  the effect on business confidence  in  revivingenergy and enterprise.  We  recommend that a general  tariff ofthis kind,  whether it was limited  to  manufactured  goods or was of a wider character, should in any case be removed in the event of abnormal  unemployment  being  clearly  at  an end,  or  of a sub-stantial recovery of the price-level  (say) to the  1925-28 standard.Whether it can be said in advance that the political constitution and psychology in this country  at a future time will  be such  asto prevent these  limits and  conditions  from being  observed, we regard as a matter  for political  and not for economic judgment.It is not a question which can be  answered negatively  merely by aninduction  from economic history, since  there is no  precedent fora  tariff  introduced   subject   to  such specific  limitations  as weprescribe.    96.  We  are of  opinion  that this tariff should  be relaxed  infavour  of  any  of  the  Dominions  that  grants us a  sufficientpreference  in  exchange;  and  that  we  should allow  complete freedom of import to any country which  allows  the  same  freedom to us.    97.  One of  us  (Professor  Pigou),  while  agreeing  that  thearguments for  such  a tariff are stronger  than for  safeguardingduties,  nevertheless   dissents from this  proposal on  the  following grounds :        The majority propose that  a 10 per cent, general tariff should    be  imposed  now and should be  removed again when  abnormal    unemployment disappears or the price-level is restored.  If there    were any real  prospect of this  condition  as to removal being    adhered to, the objections to the proposal would not be very    serious; though the knowledge  that it  is proposed  to remove    the  duty when  unemployment  disappears  could  hardly  fail    to  have a disturbing influence  on business.  But  in practice    it  is very unlikely that the tariff would be removed when this    depression ends.  On the contrary, even if  it were not  raised    much above 10 per cent,  during the present depression, as in    fact might easily happen,  it would almost certainly be kept on    afterwards;  then, at the next depression, to meet that, the rates    of  duty would be increased; and so on cumulatively.   The    temporary tariff,  little  as it  is  desired  by those  proposing  it,    would  become  not merely a permanent, but  an ever-expanding    tariff.   There  is no instance in  history of a tariff imposed to    meet a depression and removed&apos; when good times  returned.    XII.-METHODS  OF ADJUSTING MONEY  INCOMES                        GENERALLY.    98.  We have  attributed  a major part of our present difficulties to the change in the value  of money.  In so far as this may require a  compensating change in money wages,  it would be  easier tojustify a general reduction  of  money wages which was accompaniedby a  change in other kinds of fixed or quasi-fixed money incomes.The case  is,  therefore, strong  for trying to find  some kind ofgeneral scheme which would affect a wide range of money incomes and.  would   not   be  concentrated  on  particular   categories.Moreover,  a  general  scheme  would  avoid the  difficulties  andinequities of piecemeal settlements.    99. The advantages of the  general schemes to  be considered in  this section  can be classified as follows : -     (i) They would apply  to a wide  range of money incomes and          not- merely to money  wages,  and would therefore effect          a more complete  economic readjustment  and  would  be          more commendable to  public opinion.
   (ii) They would  be likely to involve a  less reduction in real          wages than a reduction in money wages  that would have          an equal effect upon employment (rents being  the most          important item in  this connection for the working class,          but  the  relief  to  taxation  being  also  of  first-rate          importance for the community as a whole).   (iii)  They would (if they involved  a  rise in prices) be likely to          provoke less social resistance than a reduction of money          wages which involved the same reduction of real wages:          inasmuch as for all sorts of  human reasons men cling to          the level  of money  wages which  they have  won  for          themselves,  and will  not  readily believe promises  of          future  compensating  benefits  from  an  increase in  the          purchasing power of money, even though these promises          are well-founded.   (iv)  They would effect their results automatically or by agree-          ment  over the  whole  field, instead  of  piecemeal by  a          series of separate conflicts, which  are  likely  to result          unequally in accordance  with  the bargaining strength of          the different groups concerned:  for, apart from special          measures, there is no available means for bringing about          a  general  reduction  of  wages   except  by  a series  of          struggles industry by  industry  and district by  district,          the results of which would be unequal and unfair and the          reductions perhaps greatest where they  would  be least          useful  or least  justifiable.  Indeed, a  struggle of this          kind would  offer a prospect to which no one could loot:          forward without misgiving.   100.   It is for these  reasons that a general rise in world prices(i.e.,  a  general fall in  the  value of  money) would be  the best of allremedies.  Failing this,  the most obvious method would be to alter the value of sterling in terms of gold.  i.c, to devaluate.                        (a) Devaluation.   101.   Prior  to  the  return to the gold standard  in  1925, thevalue of sterling had,  in  fact, been fluctuating&apos;in  terms of goldwithin a somewhat wide range.  It would have then  been open tothis  country to  fix the value of sterling at a different relation togold from that which was actually chosen, and, in  fact, the majorityof us were in favour at that time of postponing the decision to fix the value of sterling at its pre-war parity.   102.   It is, however, quite a different matter  to-day to go backon the decision  then made.   We think  that  there would  be grave objections to such  a course, because of  its reactions  on our inter-national  credit,  and none  of us are prepared to  recommend it atthe present time.  Nevertheless,  we should not put out of our mindsthe possibility  that it  may  conceivably  become  necessary in thefuture for a number of  countries to join  together  in making drastic changes  in  an international currency system which  is serving usso ill.                    (b)  Tariffs  plus Bounties.   103.   In view of the difficulty of  raising world prices  and theobjections to devaluation,  we have considered  whether any  alter-native scheme is possible which would have effects internally similarto those  of  a rise of world costs or of devaluation, and yet wouldbe something which we ourselves could put into force without injury to the national credit.   104.   The following is  an outline of a scheme intended  to be ofthis kind which has bean laid before us, with some of the arguments which can be adduced in  its support :       (1) &quot; The  proposal is for a uniform tariff of, say, 10 per cent.   on all imports whatsoever, including food, and a bounty of the   same  amount  on nil exports whatsoever.
   (2) Ths effect of such an arrangement on international trade would be to restore substantially the conditions which would existunder Free Trade if world  costs were to rise 10 per cent., or ifdomestic costs were to be reduced 10 per cent.; except that it ismore favourable than  the latter to our export trades and to trades which compete with imports, and would  be therefore all the morehelpful in increasing our foreign balance and the volume of our foreign investment.   (8) The effect at  home would  be similar to a rise of worldcosts, but different from a cut in domestic money costs, since thelatter would leave rentiers  and other recipients of fixed incomesto get the full benefit of the resulting fall in the cost  of living.   Itwould, therefore,  be much  fairer, since  it would affect the valueof all incomes,  &amp;c, fixed in terms  of money, in  the  same kindof way, and would not discriminate against wage-earners.   (4) It would have, in effect, the same result as devaluation,except that it would leave  sterling  international  obligations-unchanged  in  terms of  gold.   There  are,  obviously,  verygreat  advantages  in this from the point of view of the nationalcredit.  Moreover,  since we  are  a creditor nation in terms  of sterling,  and our imports exceed our exports,  there  is actuallya pecuniary benefit to us in leaving the gold value  of  sterlingalone.   (5) It would  diminish  the  real burden  of  the  internalnational  debt   as compared  with  wage  reductions, since theservice of the national debt  would be  a smaller percentage  ofthe  national income  in terms of  money than if money wages were  to  be  reduced.  Moreover,  it would bring,  on  balance,a substantial sum into the Exchequer.   (6) It could be brought about by a  single act of legislation,of a  kind much less  likely to  be unpopular than reductions  ofmoney wages concentrated on  the working classes, the  positionof all other recipients of money  incomes being left untouched.At  the  same  time,   it  would involve  no  interference  withcontract.   (7) Since the tariff or the bounty, as the case might  be,would  apply to  all  exports  and  all   imports  (ships  for  thispurpose  would have  to be regarded as an export),  no rebatesor complications  of  any  kind would  be  required.  Importedraw materials  would pay the tariff, but when they  were workedup into exports they would get the money back in  the shape ofthe bounty.   The only  point that could  arise  in  the  case  ofmanufacture  for  export  would be the  interest  on the import duty paid during the period  of  manufacture, which might  bemet  by some  sort of  deferred system  of  discharging the dutyout of the subsequent proceeds of the bounty.   (8) It would  tend to have an  equalising effect as betweensheltered and  unsheltered industries,  since it  would  be  theunsheltered industries which  would benefit directly and in  thefirst  instance.   (9) For various  reasons  such a scheme might be  imprac-ticable in its entirety; but it could be applied in  part  withoutlosing all its advantages.  Bounties on exports may sometimesbe inconsistent with  our commercial treaties or with the tariffarrangements   of  other  countries.  In this  case  it  would  benecessary to substitute for bounties a  rebate equivalent to  theduties paid on imported  material, and  further  assistance  tothe  export  industries would  have  to  take some  other form.Or  again,  the fact  that  our imports  exceed our exports,  sothat a balance of revenue would remain, would make it jiossibleto free from the tariff some  categories of goods  which it wasconsidered undesirable to tax.  At the  minimum such a scheme would dwindle  into  practically  the  equivalent of a  10  percent, tariff on manufactured goods,   part of the proceeds  ofwhich  might   be  devoted to granting  special  reliefs  from taxation to the export industries.  For  several of the argumentsadduced above are  partially  applicable to a tariff not accom-panied  by a bounty.    (10)  Such  a  scheme  should  he regarded  primarily  as  a means  of  avoiding economic instability  at  home due to  the
   violent change in world prices, the necessity  for which might,   one would  hope,  be temporary.   In  the event of a  sufficient   recovery  in  world prices, it  should  be gradually reduced  and   finally abolished.&apos;-   105.   As to  the  advantages of  this  scheme, we  are  equallydivided.   Two  of us (Mr. Keynes and Sir Josiah  Stamp) are muchattracted by  it.  They  recommended  that its practical possibilitiesshould be  carefully explored.   They  prefer it. on principle, to a tariff, because it is free from the possibility of adverse repercussions on  our export  industries,  and  because, being  more  clearly  anexpedient to  preserve equilibrium,  it avoids some of the disadvan-tages of  a  protective  tariff.   The question of  the feasibility ofbounties or other means of assisting exports is one on which they find  it difficult to  pronounce before  a concrete  scheme has been worked out.  In any  event, as in the case of the  10 per cent, tariffabove, it  should be removed in  the  event of abnormal unemploy-ment being clearly at  an  end or of a substantial recovery  of theprice-level (say)  to the 1925-8 standard.   106.   Two   of  us  (Mr.  Henderson  and   Professor  Pigoujon  the other  hand  are  opposed to  this  proposal.   A  generalscheme  of   bounties  upon  exports  would,  in   their  view,  be immediately  countered  by  action  under  anti-dumping   clausesor otherwise  on the  part of other  countries.  All countries  resentsubsidies given by other countries to their exports as a particularlyunfair form of competition; and the view that it is bad internationalconduct to resort to such practices has become widespread  in recentyears.  If accordingly this  country were  to  adopt  the scheme proposed it would not only expose itself  to  retaliatory  action:  but would  be generally regarded as having committed a serious offence against international economic comity.   These considerations, tosay nothing of the  practical difficulties which the organisation and working of such a scheme would involve, lead them to conclude thatthe  bounty  element in it  would need   either to be  abandonedaltogether or to be  so whittled down  that  its purpose was  defeated.If,   however,  this  element  is  excluded,  the  scheme   becomesindistinguishable from  that of the simple  10  per cent,  tariff on imports,  discussed  above  in paragraphs 94-97.            XIII. SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS.   107.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows :      (a) THE CAUSES OF THE  PRESENT DEPRESSION.   An entirely new  situation  has been created by  the  presenttrade depression, which has been  marked by the catastrophic fallin the  prices  of  staple commodities.  Between   September  .1929and  August  1930, dollar   prices fell  21 per  cent,  and  sterlingprices  17 per cent,  (paragraphs 5 and 18).   Although  the greater part of the civilised world  has also beenengulfed in the present depression, there are certain  peculiaritieswhich distinguish the difficulties of Great Britain  from  those  of therest  of the world.   Up to  the eve of the  slump the  rest of theworld was, generally  speaking, experiencing  a period of prosperity;but  for some  years  Great  Britain  had  shown  signs of  seriousmalaise; during this period  the total of unemployed in  this countrynever  fell below  a  million.   Great  areas in  the  North  werestationary or declining.  British export  trade as  a  whole showeddisquieting symptoms of stagnation  (paragraph 6).   The depression  of trade in  Great Britain since  the War maybe regarded  as the  resultant of (a)  adversely changing  externalconditions and (b)  a  lack of internal  adaptability (paragraph 8).   The main changes in the broad external  environment of Britishindustry since the war are to he found in :    (a) the altered  conditions  of  demand   for  the   products  of          certain industries due  to the change from  war to peace;   (b) general changes in world  economic  conditions,  eg.,  the          development  of  the cotton industry in the Par East,          the less favourable  terms on which agricultural countries          have  been  able  to dispose  of  their products,  the great          fall in the  price of silver,  etc.
    (c)  political developments during  the period,  e.g.,  the  occu-           pation  of  the  Ruhr,  currency  disorders   in  many           European  countries, troubles in India and China, etc.;    (d)  the general  fall  in world  gold-prices between  1924  and           1929 and  dislocation  in  Great Britain  caused  by  the           return to the gold  standard;    (c)  the tariff policies of other countries  (paragraph  9).    In  the same  period  the  capacity  of  Great  Britain  for  rapid adaptation has been insufficient to cope  with the changing conditions with which it has been confronted.  This has been due to     (a)  the adverse changes  (due to war losses) in the  age  coin-           position of  the population (paragraphs 10  and 11);    (b)  the increase of rings and monopolistic combinations designed           deliberately  to   restrict  the  volume  of  trade   (para-           graph 12):    (c)  the reluctance on  the  part  of industry to recognise the           existence of  changed  conditions,  either  on  the  side  of           technique or on the side of demand (paragraph 12);    (d)  the persistence of restrictive rules and practices among trade           unions on  (i) the entry to particular occupations and the           demarcation  of  different occupations, and  on (ii)  the           conditions  under which certain  work can be done (para-           graph 12):    (e) the rigidity of  wages (paragraph  14).    Rigidity of wage-rates may act as a  definite hindrance to  change and progress, as the rate at which industries can expand is, in  part, a function  of the rate  of wages it has to pay.  Moreover, when \wages are kept rigid, there is a  grave  danger  that the  arrangement  of industry which is  thus brought  about may  be injurious  to  the interests of the working classes as  a whole (paragraphs 16 and 17). (b) THE  EFFECTS OF  LARGE  CHANGES  IN THE VALUE                          IN  MONEY.    In spite of the phenomenal fall in world gold prices in the last twelve months (paragraph 18), it would be imprudent to assume thatthere  may  not be a further fall.   Some  recovery may be anticipatedat a fairly  early date  from the present  exceptionally low level, butit  is not certain  that this rise  may  not be  followed by a furthersagging tendency in  the price level continued over a  long  period (paragraph 21).    If  this  should happen, it is  impossible  to  over-estimate  the disastrous  consequences that may be expected.  All money settle-ments of every kind, upon which the  stability  and prosperity of modern  life, organised as it  is, so profoundly depend, would becomehopelessly  inappropriate (paragraph 22).  If the large changes that have taken place in  the last  year in the  value of  money remain unaltered   or  become  aggravated, the  following are  outstanding-examples of the results which will ensue  :     (a) a very great  increase in  the  effective  burden  of inter-          Governmental  debts  arising out   of  the  war  (para-          graph. 23):    (b) a great aggravation  of the&apos; budgetary problem presented by          internal  national  debts  and   all  other  Government          obligations  which are  fixed  in  terms  of money (e.g.,          pensions, unemployment relief,  &amp;c.) (paragraph 28);    (c) a similar increase in the effective burden on  industry of alt          forms of bonded  debt  (eg.,  debenture  interest,  &amp;c.)          (paragraph  23);    (d) a serious  disequilibrium between  money costs  and  money          prices leading to  business losses and a great  increase in          unemployment (paragraphs 28 and  24).    The  foregoing  represent the maladjustments  which arise  if  a fall in prices  becomes evenly  spread  over  commodities in general.At  the moment, the outstanding feature of the economic  situationis an extreme disparity between the prices  of primary products and manufactured goods,  which is  quite incompatible  with an  active
condition  of  world  trade.   Until new markets  are  found for themanufactured goods which  the primary producers  are  unable topurchase  or  new types  of  goods are produced  instead  of  them,industrial unemployment on a large  scale  must  prevail.   In such circumstances under  the pressure of -competition,  the  prices of manufactured goods  are likely  to  fall owing  to  the  inevitablemovement in  industrial countries  to reduce  costs  by  everyavailable  means  (including  the  reduction  of  salaries and  wages(paragraph 25)).   This  is the most critical phase of the  world - depression for an industrial country like Great Britain, since if manufacturing costs of production are cut drastically  throughout the  world, it will notbe possible for  this country  to  abstain from joining  in the generalmovement (paragraph  26).     (c) REMEDIES OP  AN EXTERNAL CHARACTER.   An adequate  recovery of  world prices  would go  a  long  wTaytowards providing a solution of the present difficulties.   Monetaryconditions, which play a  dominating part in determining the  courseof world prices over a long  period, depend  upon the production ofgold, its  distribution  among the different countries  and  its  use by Central Banks.    On this head our conclusions  (paragraph  29)are :      (i)  the  prevailing practice of  certain  foreign  Central  Banks          are not such as to encourage optimism;    (ii)  there is  no  insufficiency  in  the  total -supply  of  gold,          provided  that it is used by Central Banks with reasonable          economy;   (iii)  the  problem  turns  upon   the  policies  which Central          Banks  pursue, and upon the possibility of inducing them          to  act together.   The matter is not one  in  which it is  possible  for any singlecountry  acting alone  to accomplish  much.  Some influence thiscountry can  exert;  and  more might be accomplished,  for example,by the  Federal Reserve System of the United  States joining  theBank of England  to  take  drastic   action on a  common plan(paragraph  30).   The difficulty at the  moment is not a general scarcity of short-term credit for first-class borrowers;  but is&apos;due, in  the first place,to the reluctance of borrowers to enter upon new enterprise in an atmosphere of  a falling price-level;  and,  in the second place, tothe  decline of  the  standing of many borrowers in  the opinion oflenders owing  to the widespread  distrust  of  the  stability  of  thefinancial  and currency  systems  of a number of countries  (para-graph  31).   The revival of  enterprise might be  promoted by joint action on the part  of  the Central Banks directed towards creating a strong conviction that the  present easy terms  for  short-termcredit are likely to continue  for a long time to come (paragraph 32).Central Banks might  also  allay  the  distrust  now felt  towards  thegeneral credit  of certain countries by forming  a large  joint poolfor  approved loans or  in  some  other way.    It  is of  the first importance   to restore  a  feeling  of confidence in  the  financial stability of  those many countries which  are  now  the  subject ofdistrust (paragraphs 88 and 34). (d)  WAYS OF RESTORING ELASTICITY TO THE ECONOMIC             STRUCTURE OF GREAT  BRITAIN.    No very  satisfactory  measures have yet been proposed for thecontrol of rings  and monopolies, but the  experience of the Boardof   Trade   Committee   on  Trusts   might   well   be   reviewed(paragraph  37).    As regards  trade union restrictions no direct Government action is  possible.    The  demarcations  and  trade  customs  are  nowinappropriate and inimical  to  the interests of the working  classesas a whole.  If the trade unions would agree to reopen  the  wholequestion, there  might be  a surprising increase in  the  ability ofemployers to  offer increased  employment at the  existing  wages(paragraphs  88-40).
    We recommend  that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government should forth-with  undertake  a  systematic  reform  of the  whole  system  ofunemployment insurance, which is now gravely abused.  It impedesmobility  of  labour,  encourages  the adoption  of  unsatisfactorymethods of meeting  industrial changes and conduces to an artificialrigidity- of wage-rates (paragraph 41).   (e)  WAYS OF  INCREASING INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY.    Great attention has been  devoted  in recent years to measures designed  to  improve the  industrial  organisation and  technique  ofthe staple industries, but  the  efficiency  of industries  which areexpanding or  are  capable  of  expansion is  equally  important.Improvements  in  industrial methods are being rapidly adopted by foreign countries and though it is of  cardinal importance that GreatBritain should not lag behind, little  positive  amelioration of the competitive position  can be expected under this  head.  Moreover,in so far as  &apos;&apos; rationalisation &apos;&apos;  includes schemes for orderly con-traction  of output,  it is likely  to  increase  unemployment:  and improved  industrial  technique  which  takes  the   form  of  theintroduction  of labour-saving  machinery  may  also  involve  atemporary aggravation of unemployment (paragraph 42).    All well-considered schemes of industrial reconstruction shouldbe pressed forward to the utmost, but they cannot by themselvesprovide a  complete  solution  to  the present economic  difficulties(paragraph 43).     (f)  REDUCTIONS  IN DOMESTIC  MONEY  WAGES.    (i)  Existing money wage-rates cannot be regarded as sacrosanctin a world subject to violent changes in  the  value of money.    (ii) Certain wage  adjustments  in the  downward  direction,particularly in sheltered industries whose existing wages are out of line with  wages in other comparable industries, are desirable now.    (iii) If world prices fail  to recover  to a materially- higher level,general wage-cuts  in  this country (or their equivalent) will become inevitable, because the failure  of  the price-level  to  recover  willprobably  mean  that such  wage-cuts  have  been  made  in othercountries.    (iv) But,  on the other hand, it would  be unwise  for this countryto  lead  the  way  with a general  wage-cut or  to  encourage anincipient world movement in  this direction.    (v) In view of  the immense practical difficulties of any general reduction in  money  wages,  every other  remedy  with any  seriousbalance of argument  in its  favour should  be tried  first.    (vi) Furthermore, if a general wage-cut becomes inevitable,  itis most desirable that it should be undertaken as part of a widerscheme for re-settling money incomes generally  (including rentierincomes in particular), and  not wages alone.                (g)  SUBSIDIES  TO WAGES.    The effect upon unemployment  of  a general subsidy to moneywages  is primd facie the same  as  that  of an  equal proportionatereduction in  money wage-rates.  If it were  possible by a low rate of subsidy to absorb  a  large  number  of the unemployed,  it might happen that  the whole cost  of the subsidy would be off-set by the associated reduction  in the amount of unemployment benefit.   Butit would be highly  optimistic to suppose that a general wage subsidyat any given rate  would, in fact, reduce the volume of unemploy-ment  to this extent.   Hence it is to be feared  that, if the subsidywere  at  all  substantial,  it  would involve  a heavy  additional  netcharge on the  Budget.   In the circumstances,  we are of opinionthat a policy of general wage  subsidies is not one that ought to beadopted (paragraph 52).    Wage  subsidies  in respect,  not of  all  wage-earners,  but ofadditional  wage-earners,  whom  employers  would undertake  to engage with  the help of  the subsidy, are not  open to the sameobjections.   But the practical difficulties  in devising schemes oftins type  are  very   great  (paragraph 58).   It  may be  that inparticular cases these could be  overcome  and  a  workable scheme
                              a;?could be devised  in which  the  disadvantages were  at a minimum and the advantages to employment at a maximum.   If  and where this is so, it appears to the majority of us (Mr. Keynes, ProfessorPigou  and Sir Josiah  Stamp)  that  the case for temporary  wagesubsidies in respect of additional employees at a rate less than thepresent rate of unemployment pay is a strong one.  Mr. Hendersonholds strongly that the path of subsidies should be avoided.   Butsubsidies to wages in particular industries, as a permanent system,are highly undesirable  (paragraph  54).  (h) WAYS  OF INCREASING  BUSINESS CONFIDENCE.   An improvement  in the state of business confidence  would leadto an increase of employment in home industries (paragraph 55).   In the  long  run  business confidence  is not likely to be main-tained otherwise than by an  actual recovery of business profits.Such  a recovery  might  be  secured   by  judicious  emergency measures, after  which business confidence might take the place ofsuch measures as providing the necessary stimulus (paragraph 56).   The following measures would assist in the improvement  ofbusiness confidence :    (a) A solution of  the Budget problem which avoided increased         direct taxation;   (b) A drastic reform of the system of Unemployment Insurance          (paragraph 57).A tariff on manufactured  imports is also recommended  in some quarters under this head (paragraph 57).      (i) WAYS  OF  INCREASING HOME  INVESTMENT.   The amount  of home investment, and so the volume of employ-ment, would be increased if the terms on which borrowers  can be accomodated were made  easier either through a reduction of flit-rate  of interest  or through  Government stimulus, by means of subsidies or public works (paragraph 58).   (a) The Bank of  England cannot, under gold-standard  limita-          tions, move far in the  direction of making bank  credit          cheap and  abundant unless other Central Banks  do the          same; a policy  on the  part  of the Treasury  and  the          banking system intended to bring down  long-term rate?          of interest, even if  it meant some raising of short-term         rates,  would  be  useful  on balance as  facilitating ai.          increase of  long-term investment (paragraph 59).             In  recent  months short-term  rates of interest have          fallen  to a low  level,  but this  reduction  is only  verj          slightly reflected in long-term  rates which are of much          greater signifiearice  to  borrowers  for  fixed  investment          (paragraph 60).     (b) The effect of high world  rates of  interest under  a gold          standard is to put the domestic rate  above the rate at          which  enough new  domestic  investment  can come into          existence.   Since the War, attempts have been made to          restore equilibrium  by imposing an embargo on foreign          lending in  London,  and subsequently by  the  informal          rationing of foreign borrowers, but  these measures have          hitherto proved  ineffective.    Bonds issued  on foreign          markets have found their way to the London market,          without having  paid  British stamp duty and  contrary to          the wishes  of those responsible for the  regulation of the          British  market.   In these circumstances,  a  distinction          might be made  between foreign bonds officially  admitted          to the British  investment  market  (perhaps  by  the          Treasury on the recommendation of the Bank of England)          and those not so admitted, income derived from the latter          being subject to  a special income tax (paragraph 62).   (c) Under conditions of extensive unemployment such as  prevail          to-day, and have prevailed in lesser degree for some years,     [21809]                                              FBBBHBflBMflHBHHNIfiHyHWHBHHnnBMMmuniMUUiiiiinra
          the policy of promoting useful schemes of capital develop-          ment, either by pressing forward such work as lies within          the direct control of the Government or by  the offer of          State subsidies to local authorities and public  utility com-          panies is a sound one for the State to pursue,  since we do          not accept the view  that the undertaking  of  such  work          must  necessarily cause  a  mere  diversion  from   other          employment (paragraph  G3).    The saving to public funds in the shape of reduced  expenditureon  unemployment  benefit must  not  be  overlooked: but  it  isimportant to recognise  that public works can only be  justified  ifthey are of a useful and productive  character and are capable ofbeing put into operation and carried out with speed.   Considera-tions of this  character necessarily  set limits to the extent to whichit is possible to meet unemployment  by  the  policy of public works(paragraphs  64-67).                         (j)  TARIFFS.    We accept the  validity  of the traditional Free Trade argument that there is a strong presumption  that  tariffs of the  kind  whichare imposed in practice  tend to divert production from the channelswhere  a country is relatively  more  efficient into  channels  whereit is relatively less efficient (paragraphs 68 and 69).(a) Advantages of a Tariff.    But the  question to-day  is  the extent to which this historicargument is  invalidated for  the time being by  (i)  the existenceof chronic large-scale unemployment, (ii) the doubt whether thiscountry  can  hope materially  to  expand or  even to   retain her present favourable balance of  trade  by  means of a  moderate cut in money costs without  a restriction of imports, (iii) the possibility that the  effect of a tariff on  the  &apos;&apos; terms  of trade &apos;&apos; might be greater in present  circumstances than formerly, and (iv)  whetherthe promotion  of  economic solidarity within  the  British Empiremay not be a safeguard against the  dangers  of economic  isolationin the  modern world (paragraph 70).    (i)  Though unemployment before  the War was  sometimes large          in  amount,  there  was  no  large  intractable  mass of          unemployment associated with dislocations  between costs          and world prices such as has existed ever since the post-          armistice  boom.  The  unemployment  issue thus  was          often left on one side in tariff discussions.   The situa-          tion is,  however, now fundamentally different, and in          present  conditions the imposition of reasonably devised          protective duties (though  one. of  us  (Professor Pigou)          thinks  that  in practice  it  might not be easy to  devise          them) that should exclude  a  substantial portion of the          imports   that now  compete  with  our  home industries          would,   for some time  to  come,  directly increase the          aggregate volume of  employment  in this  country, and          by so  doing would  set up repercussions through the          saving  on the  unemployment  benefit  and so  on,  that          would,   by indirect  processes  increase  it  still  further.          The gain would probably be associated with some increase          in the  cost  of living and  a corresponding reduction in          real wages and in the value of money incomes generally;          but since a main alternative remedy for unemployment           a reduction of money wages must also involve  an equal          or greater reduction of  real wages,  this consideration is          not of great weight (paragraphs 71 and  72).             The  important question to decide is whether the  direct          effect, and therewith the indirect  effects,  of reasonably          devised   protective  duties  in   increasing the  aggregate          volume  of employment would  be large or small.   The          answer  to this  question turns  in  great part upon the          degree of adverse reaction  which the contraction brought          about in our imports is likely  to produce  on our export          industries.  The majority  (Mr. Keynes, Mr. Henderson
       and Sir Josiah  Stamp)  take  the view that in  present       conditions the  main  part  of  the reduction of  imports       would be balanced  for several years by increased sales       to us of foreign-held  securities (paragraphs 72 and 73).          One  of us  (Professor Pigou)  holds  that the  adverse       reaction on exports would  after a short time be nearly       commensurate  with the  original  contraction of  imports       (paragraph 74).(ii) If  the  view of  the majority in this matter  is correct, the       point is  to-day  a very  important  one.   The majority       believe  that it  is  essential at the present  time  for Great       Britain to devote  a somewhat large proportion  of her       total savings to foreign investment (paragraph 75).  The       favourable balance of  trade, which must be equal to the       amount  of foreign  lending  if the Bank  of England  is       not  to lose gold could be increased either by  increasing       exports or by  diminishing imports.  By reducing costs,       and  particularly by cutting wages costs,  it is possible       to increase  the volume  of  exports, but there are  great       difficulties in making much headway along this line.  It is       therefore better  to occupy our  unemployed  resources       in making goods to take the place of  goods now imported       than not to  occupy them  at  all.  Por this  is  just  as       effective a way of increasing foreign  investment  and       augmenting employment  as  increasing  exports  would be       (paragraph 77).   Moreover,  tariffs might  also be to the       advantage of the overseas countries which need our surplus-       savings for their further development (paragraph  79).(iii) There  is general  agreement that, when a country imposes       taxes upon imports, it  will cause a unit of its export goods       to buy somewhat  more import goods than  before, or, in       more popular language, that in some measure it will make       the foreigner pay its import duties.  Before the War,  it       was  generally  agreed  that,  so far as Great Britain was       concerned, the gain that could be looked  for under this       head was very small,  but in present conditions, in view       of the large amount of surplus capacity in the  iron and       steel and other industries abroad, it may be that  a more       substantial advantage  might be won  (paragraph 80).(iv) The tendency since the  War has been in the direction of       intensified economic nationalism,  which is seen in such       projects  as  the  movement  of neighbouring groups of       countries to grant one another preferential tariff  conces-       sions, to which  the outside world is not admitted.   If such       agreements materialise, the interests of Great Britain may       perhaps best be safeguarded by  cultivating closer economic       relations with the Empire. We consider  that the develop-       ment of inter-Imperial preferences may become  a wise       economic policy for this country  (paragraphs 81  to 85)-(b) Objections to a Tariff.   Notwithstanding the foregoing  advantages,  there  remain  with-unabated force certain arguments of a more  general kind against a tariff, namely :      (i)  A tariff may enable a country to snatch for itself an advan-         tage which is not so great as the damage which it inflicts          on the world.  The world would be richer under a system          of  general Free Trade than it is (paragraph 86).    (ii)  Governments dependent upon  popular elections are certain          to  impose protective duties,  not on weak industries that          may need  them,  but  rather  on strong industries  that          control numerous votes (paragraph 86).   (iii)  Duties create vested industries, which it is difficult to remove          later without inflicting considerable  incidental hardship          (paragraph 86).   (iv)  So long as the issue of Protection versus Free Trade, divides          political parties, duties are liable to be imposed or removed          not on their merits but according to the exigency of party         conflict  (paragraph  86).
(o) Conclusions.   We  differ among  ourselves  in weighing up  the balance  ofadvantage or disadvantage resulting from courses of action  which,while probably increasing employment in the immediate  future,would also be open to the  objections  indicated above  (paragraphs87 and 88).  In formulating our conclusions we think it  important to distinguish sharply between two different types of tariff,  viz.,safeguarding and a revenue tariff (paragraph 89).   A theoretical case  may exist  for safeguarding duties, by whichwe understand tariffs imposed primarily for protective purposes infavour of specially selected industries,  especially when an argumentof the &quot;infant industry&quot; character  is applicable.   But  in theactual conditions of Great Britain to-day, we think that it is difficultto find exceptional  cases of this kind  (paragraph 90).         Conclusions of  Mr. Keijnes,  Mr. Henderson and                        Sir Josiah Stamp. (i) Safeguarding.   Apart from  existing  duties,  there  is no case  amongst manu-factures   which appears to us  to  deserve  serious  consideration,except a tariff on iron and steel  and their products.   In this case,we are  in  favour  of  protective  duties  in  the  present  grave emergency, subject to the strict condition that  the industry shouldrationalise itself in  accordance with  an approved plan, and thatthe tariff  should  be of a  weight and scope  appropriate,  not topresent,  conditions  but   to  those  which  will exist  after theirreconstruction (paragraph  91).   In  the case of agriculture, it  hasbeen  put  to us that  pig-products  and  poultry-products offer  animportant  field  for replacing imports by home  production, and  wethink that the case  should  be seriously examined (paragraph 93). (ii) A Revenue  Tariff.   Having regard to  the  various considerations discussed in  theBeport,  to the  Budgetary problem, and to  the effect  on businessconfidence, there  exists  a sufficient case  for a comparatively  lowgeneral tariff (say 10 per cent.), covering wide categories of importswithout discrimination, either on manufactured goods or manufac-tured goods and food, designed to mitigate the conditions  of generaldisequilibrium   now   existing,  rather  than  to favour  particular industries  (paragraph 94).   We  recommend    (a) that such  a  tariff should in any case  be  removed in  the          event of  abnormal unemployment being  clearly at  an          end, or of a substantial recovery7 of  the price-level (say)          to the 19-25-28 standard.  (The possibility  of these limits          and conditions being observed we  regard as a matter  for          political and  not for  economic judgment;  there is  no          historical  precedent for such a tariff as we envisage,  and          the question  cannot  therefore  be answered  negatively          (paragraph 95):   lb) that the tariff should be  relaxed in favour  of any of  the          Dominions according to this country a sufficient prefer-          ence in exchange, and that  complete freedom of import          should be  accorded to any country which allows the same          freedom to Great Britain  (paragraph  96).                  Dissent  of  Professor  Pic/ou. (i) Safeguarding.   Professor Pigou  dissents from the conclusions of the majorityconcerning the protection  of iron and steel on  the following grounds:    (a) it would be  impracticable to protect  iron and steel without           at the  same  time  not merely  granting drawbacks to           export industries that  use steel in their work, but  also           somehow  compensating home&apos;industries  that do  this.
          Prom simple beginnings  an elaborate  and complicated          system of  duties or  other  compensatory  arrangements          would thus grow up;    (b) the condition  for protection,  i.e.,  that  the industry should          undertake to  rationalise itself, is not one that is capable          of being  enforced;   for  &apos;&apos; the industry&apos;&apos;  is  not  an          individual.    It might even  happen  that,  under  the          shelter of  protection,  inefficient firms  would be  main-          tained  and  the  process  of  rationalisation  actually          impeded;    (c) a duty of this character, though  imposed as a  temporary          measure,  would prove in practice, when  the  circum-          stances, in respect of which  the majority contemplate it,          have disappeared, exceedingly difficult to remove;    (d) if it be  the fact that, in view of the  heavy losses which it          has sustained, the industry is unable to raise the capital          necessary to modernise its plant and so do without some          form of Government assistance,  methods  of  assistance          other than  those of a tariff are  available (paragraph 92).(ii) A Revenue Tariff.    Professor Pigou,  while agreeing that the  arguments for sucha  tariff are  stronger than for safeguarding  duties,  neverthelessdissents from the recommendation of  the majority in favour of a low general tariff.  His reasons are  as follows.  If there were  any real prospect of a tariff once imposed  being removed, as the majoritysuggest, when abnormal  unemployment disappears  or the price-level is restored, the objections  to the proposal would not be very serious;though the knowledge that it is proposed  to remove the duty whenunemployment  disappears could hardly fail  to have  a  disturbinginfluence on  business.  But in  practice it is very unlikely  that thetariff  would be removed when  this  depression ends.   On the con-trary, even if it were not raised much above 10 per cent, during thepresent depression,  as in fact might  easily happen, it would almost certainly be  kept on  afterwards : then, at the next depression,  tomeet  that,  the rates of  duty  would  be increased; and  so  oncumulatively.  The temporary tariff, little as it is desired by thoseproposing it, would become not merely a permanent, but an ever-expanding  tariff.   There is  no  instance in  history  of  a tariffimposed to  meet  a  depression and  removed when good  timesreturned (paragraph 97).    (k) METHODS   OF  ADJUSTING  MONEY  INCOMES                         GENERALLY.    The major part  of the present difficulties is due to the  changein  the value  of  money.   In  so  far  as  this  may  require  acompensating change in money  wages, it  would be easier to justify a general reduction of money wages  if accompanied by a change inother kinds of  fixed or giwsi-fixed money incomes.   The  case  is,therefore, a  strong one for  trying  to  find some kind of generalscheme which would  affect a wide  range of money incomes andwould  not  be concentrated on  particular  categories.   Moreover, ageneral scheme would avoid the difficulties and inequities of piece-meal  settlements (paragraph 98).  A  general  rise in world prices(i.e.,  a general fall in the value of money) w:ould be  the  best of  allremedies.   Failing this, the most obvious method would be to alter the  value   of  sterling  in  terms  of gold,  i.e.,   to  devaluate(paragraph 100).(i)  Devaluation.    Whatever might  have been  possible in 1925 before the returnto  the gold  standard,  we should see  grave  objections to-day  inreversing the decision then made; and none  of us are prepared  torecommend  such  a  course at the present time.  It  may, howeverconceivable, be necessary in the future for a number of countries  tojoin together in making  drastic changes in an international currencysystem which is serving so ill  (paragraphs 101 and  102).
(ii) Tariffs plus Bounties.   A proposal has been submitted to us for a uniform tariff of (say)10 per cent, on all imports whatsoever, including food, and a bountyof the same amount on all exports whatsoever (paragraph  104).   On the advantages of this scheme we are equally divided, two of us (Mr.  Keynes  and  Sir Josiah Stamp) being much attracted bythe scheme, the practicable possibilities of which they recommend should be  carefully explored.  They prefer it, on principle, to a tariff (provided it were removed when the same conditions as thosestipulated in the case of a tariff are fulfilled (paragraph  105).  Theremaining  two of us  (Mr. Henderson  and  Professor  Pigou)  are opposed to this proposal  since, in  their  view,  a general scheme ofbounties  upon exports  would  be  countered  by  foreign countries under anti-dumping clauses,  etc.   Moreover,  such a scheme wouldbe generally regarded as  a  serious  offence  against  international economic comity  (paragraph  106).(Signed)J.

REPORT  BY  PROFESSOR  L.  ROBBINS.                     1. INTRODUCTORY.   I have refrained from signing the Report for reasons which I setout below.  (See especially paragraph 6 below.)  I am, however, insubstantial agreement with Sections I to VII, which represent whatseems  to me to be a true diagnosis  of the causes of the presenttroubles,  and  which,  in  regard  to  international  remedies andremedies designed to restore  elasticity to industry  and the  wagesystem, indicate  broadly  the  measures to which I  myself attach importance.  The remainder,  however, appears  to me to  contem-plate   at  disproportionate length  measures  which  are  neitherdesirable nor, in  many  cases,  practicable, and I  wish  to dissociatemyself altogether from the decision to frame this part of the Beporton these lines.   There are, moreover, certain matters  about  whichI wish to make my own attitude explicit.                2. RINGS AND MONOPOLIES.   I  attach  much  more  importance  than my colleagues  to theproposal  that action  should be taken fully to investigate and bring to the public notice  the operation of rings and monopolies.  I donot anticipate  an immediate effect on  the employment  position from  the most  energetic adoption of such measures, but I do notbelieve that it is expedient to ask the  trade unions alone to revisetheir  attitude toward restrictive  practices,  or to permit  certainreductions  of wages,  unless,  at  the same time, steps are taken to expose and deal with monopolistic practices on the part of other sections of the  community.                   3. FOREIGN LENDING.   I  should  be  definitely opposed to  any measures which would,in my opinion,  tend  permanently to restrict the volume of our foreign lending.  I am,  therefore, not  prepared to  support thesuggestion  that,  in certain circumstances,   differential  taxationshould be imposed on incomes from certain kinds of foreign invest-ment, for I believe that this would be the effect of such measures.To impose differential taxation on any form of foreign investment-would be at  one blow to inflict  damage to the prestige of london as an international  money  market,  and, at the same time,  to repudiate all the laborious efforts which have been expended by therepresentatives of this country at Geneva to eliminate the anomaliesof  double  taxation.   The  attitude  of  other   Governments  inrestricting foreign investment is  not infrequently made the subjectof opprobious comment over  here.  If  we wish to urge other people to good international  behaviour, it is scarcely consistent,  at  sucha  time, to imitate precisely those elements in their policy whichwe are at  present exhorting them to  abandon.                  4. PUBLIC WORKS, ETC.   As regards expenditure on Public Works, etc.,  I agree with mycolleagues as to the  nature of the criteria to which such measures should be submitted.  I am  less certain, however, that the effectof such measures as  have already been put into operation has beenwholly good; and I  am  more apprehensive that a continuance ofthis  policy may definitely tend  to delay the coming  of recovery.Moreover, I am very dubious of the wisdom of the general  policyof subsidising the rate of interest at which  certain business  enter-prises can borrow.  In exceptional circumstances, I can conceivea justification for this policy, but I believe that it is difficult to carry it far without grave danger of waste and maldistribution.
                    8. WAGE SUBSIDIES.   I am opposed to wage subsidies.  In my view they are  boundto cause unfairness  and anomaly,  and, in the present budgetarysituation, to discuss  them at length appears to  me to be whollysuperfluous.                         6. TARIFFS.   As regards those sections of the Beport which relate to tariffs and  similar measures,  I am in complete disagreement with themajority of my  colleagues.    I do  not believe that the adoptionof the measures there discussed would be expedient, and I do notbelieve  that the form  of the discussion adequately represents thebalance of the arguments involved.  My objections under this headmay be  summarised thus :    As  regards  the general discussion of the arguments for and against  tariffs,  there are many propositions in  the  Beport withwhich I am not in serious disagreement.  The total effect I believe to be misleading.   The  impression  which I imagine  it will  make on  the  mind  of any  lay reader is  that the  various  arguments against  Free Trade which it enumerates are to be regarded, andare regarded in fact by  the majority of professional  economists,as being of a degree of importance at  least commensurate with thearguments against.    This  inference,  I  believe,  would be whollyfalse.  In the main, I believe it to be  true to  say  that,  in the past,the so-called exceptions to  the general presumption in favour  of free Trade have been  regarded by economists as academic play-things interesting as  illustrating remote  analytical  points,  but,from  the point  of  view of  practice,  completely insignificant-andthere is no reason to suppose that this is not still the case.   Someeconomists  in this country, despairing of the rigidity of moneywages,  may have turned to Protection as a desperate expedient,but, in my opinion,  it  is questionable whether  their  verdict willbe generally accepted.    The tariff is  essentially  an  expedient for  avoiding the effects ofthe rigidity of money wages, and its result must inevitably be toreduce real wages  by  raising prices.   I  agree  with my colleagues that the rigidity of money  wages is undesirable, and that, in  thepresent  emergency,  some  reduction  of  money  wages  may  benecessary.  But I  do not believe that, if this  cannot  be achieved by  calm and straight-forwarding reasoning,  it  is desirable that itshould  be attempted by indirect means.   A tariff would  tend to involve lower real wages.  There  should be no  mistake  about that.    But, while the tariff must thus be  conceived as an  expedient for avoiding the effects of wage rigidity, it is highly doubtful whether,even so,  it is  to be  regarded as  an  effective expedient.   Asubstantial proportion  of  the  unemployed  are  in   the  export industries which are technically  unprotectable.  These industries will not be helped by  Protection.   On the  contrary,  they will beinjured.  And this for two reasons:     (a)  In the first  place,  they  will be injured because,  if  we           contract the volume of imports,  we injure  our foreign           customers.  It is not, strictly speaking, true that in the           very  short  run  our  imports  and  exports  necessarily           expand and decline  in  exact correlation.  But discovery           of  this   simple   fact,  long  known  to  all reputable           economists, should not blind us to  the  solid core of truth           in the old classical catchword.  The Beport  suggests that           the contraction would be met by an increase in foreign           lending.  I  do not  believe that  this  would necessarily           follow.   But, if it did, it  would surely be an odd state of           affairs in which we had to  lend more abroad in  order to           enable customers to buy goods which  we had prevented           them  from  obtaining  by  the exchange  of  their own           products!    (6)  Secondly,  and  of even greater immediate importance, as           far as the short  run problems are concerned, protection           would raise  the  costs of the  export industries.  If the
          tariff!  is general, raw  material prices must  be affected.          If it is limited  to manufactures,  domestic prices would          still be raised.   And it must not be forgotten that many          manufactured imports are the raw material  of some of          our main exporting industries. The tinplate  industry of          Wales,  the  shipbuilding  industry generally, would  be          prejudiced by a tariff on  imported steel.   Nor should we slur over the  international repercussions of theadoption of a tariff policy by this country.  A tariff is an affirmationof separatism, a  refusal to co-operate, a declaration of rivalry.   Thattwelve years after a war which devastated civilisation and threatened to destroy the goodly heritage of European culture, we should  even be discussing such measures, is a sad reminder, not only that somemen lose faith in a groat ideal when it is not realised  quickly, butthat most are totally blind even to the most obvious considerations of material interest.  The blow which would be struck to the move-ment for low-er tariffs in the rest of the world by a decision on thepart of this  country to adopt a policy of Protectionism, would itselfinvolve reactions sufficiently serious to counterbalance  any possiblebenefits.  Our position in the modern w:orld is not such that we can afford  to give the slightest encouragement or provocation to theforces  which are continually  at  work making for  higher tariffsilse where.   7.   As regards the particular tariffs discussed  in  the Report,what I have said above indicates  the nature of my objections to the10 per cent,  general tariff.   If it is not accompanied by drawbacks, itat once hits  the export trades.  If it  is, it creates glaring anomalies.A drawback on imported steel, for example, would be  an incentive to use the foreign product.  I have no belief that the  tariff wouldbe  temporary,  or would  not lead  at once to all the  politicalabuses which elsewhere have accompanied the introduction of tariffs.We  think too highly of ourselves if we suppose that it is an  openquestion whether we can escape these things.  Those of us who donot mind corruption in public life may decide to pay this price  forthe problematic  benefits : it is important that we should realise thenature  of the price we  are  paying.   8.   The  &quot; tariff bounty &quot; proposal seems to me to be of academicinterest  only.   Any tariff  expert could destroy any  belief in itspracticability in  five minutes.   It is certain that it would be met by the immediate erection of anti-bounty duties  by foreign Powers.If it becomes   a system  of  tariffs  plus  drawbacks,  it becomesadministratively  inconvenient.   9.   As  regards the special  &quot;safeguarding&quot;  duties  proposed for iron and steel, and pig and poultry products,  I  am entirelyunconvinced that any  case has been presented.   I  agree  withProfessor Pigou&apos;s minute  of  dissent  as regards iron and  steel.If there is a special case for assistance to  this industry,  there are many ways  of providing it other than  by means  of a tariff.   As regards pig-and-poultry  products,  the  proposal seems to meeven less desirable. There is no reason to suppose that the producers of these products are in extraordinary difficulties; there can be noshadow of justification for regarding the keeping of pigs or fowls asan infant industry.  Moreover, here is a case where the repercussions on our  export trade might be expected to be directly injurious.   Asubstantial  proportion   of  our  pig-product  imports  come   from denmark.   Denmark is a considerable buyer of English  manufac-tures.   If we cease to buy  Danish bacon, is it to be supposed thatthe inhabitants of Denmark can continue to buy the same quantitiesof our manufactures?   Perhaps it will  be replied that we  may lendthem (or others) the money to do so.  This does not seem to me thekind of reply which will appeal  to the practical judgment.    There is, however,  one argument which  some might think to be-in favour of the  taxation of Danish pig-products.   Our imports  from denmark are produced  by poor  but industrious  peasants, owningtheir own land and having few  available sources of alternative occu-

If we tax Danish bacon, it is conceivable that, for a time,we may raise some little revenue, not at the cost of the English con-sumer, but at the cost of the standard of life of the Danish peasantproducer.   To some of my fellow-countrymen this may appeardesirable. To others it may appear mean and despicable.                             (Signed)     LIONEL  BOBBINS.

The rise of money value of the national incomebetween  1924  and 1928, in spite  of the fall in commodity  prices,was partly due to increased production and partly to the increasingrelative importance of services (e.g., retail distribution of which theprice has not  fallen).   From  1928  to  1929  it  appears  that  there  was a  furtherconsiderable rise in both wages  and profits.

   Table H__Real Wage and Productivity Changes since 1924.   The following table examines in detail the factors relating to therise in real wages since 1924.  It will be seen that, on the whole,physical volume of output per head has risen faster than real wages,which have been held back by the fact that retail prices have fallenmore slowly than wholesale..  There has been some rise in the ratio of wage-costs to proceeds.  The figures in the Table refer to manu-facture  and mining.   Sources :  Board of Trade Index of Production.

       j       Table  I__Wages in certain  Industries.   The following table  gives comparisons between wage rates  indifferent industries together  with  other relevant information,  suchas&apos; the rate of growth of the industry and the existing margin ofunemployment.   Absolute comparisons are attempted.   Relativechanges since  1914  are  difficult to ascertain, partly because therehave  been considerable  changes  in  the  relative  importance  ofindustries  since then,  partly because  (as  was pointed out  by theRoyal Commission on the Coal Industry, 1925) the year 1914 was theclimax of a series of exceptional years during which  there had  beena remarkable rise in wages in the exporting industries  relatively towages in general.   For all industries for which comparable information is availablefigures are given showing the rate of growth of the industry, the margin of unemployment in June 1929   (i.e.,  at  the climax  ofseasonal activity) and  average wage rates  for skilled and unskilled workers.  Where there is only one recorded wage rate for the whole industry (under some  such title as &quot; day  workers &quot;) this figure isgiven separately  in the third column as &quot;uniform  rate.&quot;   Exceptfor one or  two industries which  are highly localized (e.g., cutlery),,the figures given are the  average of rates in three representativeareas;  i.e., Greater London,  the Laneashire^Staffordshire industrialdistrict,  and   South-Western  England,  as  representing  a  pre-dominantjy rural area with scattered industrial centres.  The figures given refer only to time rates  for adult male ivorkers.  This accounts for the exclusion of such industries as  cotton and coal,  where  mostof the work is done on piece  rates.
