on(CRTS DCdJMSNT IS&apos; THE PEOPjtlliTY OF HIS  BEITA1TNIC MAJRSTYrS&apos; GOVEE1MEHT).                  O A B I IT -B T.              T5E  U.j?SRI I,. COEPEKIETOS,   Femore-ndum by the Secretary of State for pominj on                      Affairs,,          The Imperial Conference has reached  o.  crisis  onthe economic side; and unless&apos; the crisis is resolvedwithin the next few days, I see no prospect of caving theConference from shipwreck.colleagues and myself to set out, as frankly as possible,the situation as I see it *before us the fact that the people of this  country,  as indeedof the whole Empire, are hoping for, and  indeed are  demanding,real and tangible economic results from this  Conference.   if those hopes are disappointed  - if, so far from producing  anybeneficial results, the Conference breaks up  in confusion -they will certainly visit their resentment  on the Government,and it will be no use to say  that the failure was not ourfault.  Conversely if we can  achieve positive results, whichcan reasonably be bold out as offering some chance ofincreasing trade within the Empire, our position in  thecountry will be strengthened.  The fate of  the Government,in my opinion, may well be bound up with the  fate of this connection--fere use.(;,P.. 36G (30 ) .In those circumstances I think it due both to myWe have in the first place to keep very clearly
          Now there is no difference between us and.no misunderstanding- on the part of the country or of theDominion delegations attending the Conference, as to our main tariff policy.  We are definitely opposed to any newtaxation on food stuffs and raw materials.  This must hare&quot;been clear to the Dominions from the first meeting of Headsof Delegations when the economic position was discussed, andI am confident that the country will support us in maintaining that policy.          It is however wholly insufficient for us to reston this purely negative policy.  The country is locking forpositive results from this Conference and if our solecontribution to the discussion is merely to reject theproposals of the Dominions,the Conference has- failed.  It istherefore up to us to offer alternative proposals, and alternative proposals which can be made to appear sufficientlyacceptable to eneble the Dominions to put forward acceptablecounter-offers.          New we have already in fact discussed one such proposal which seems likely to fall within this category.This is the quota proposal as applied to Bapire wheat.  I amwell aware that iii the previous discussions in the Cabinet on.the subject of the quota system the plan was limited to wheatgrown in the TJ.K. and that no agreement was reached even onthat limited proposal.  I am also well aware that in his statement at the meeting of the Heads of Delegations thePresident of the Board of Trade was careful not to suggestthat the quota system was already accepted and agreed upon byHis Majo3tyfs Government in the United Kingdom.  It seems tome however that we should put  ourselves in a false position by refusing to go on with the quota system if it should prove
 acceptable to the Dominions.   If CanacU  and  Australia now say (as indeed they have already gone far towsrds saying) that they ire prepared to accept    quota system in lieu of a tariff on foreign wheat,  end we  then turn it down,  what else can they think but that we have been fooling them for the last fortnight, and what else can they say but that if all the time  we  meant to refuse not only a tariff on foreign wheat but also every alternative to such a tariff,  why d?&apos;dnTt  we say so at once and let thorn go home?.           It seems to me therefore to  be  abundantly clear that we are bound not only to  agree to e  quota system for Empire wheat, .which,  it should be remembered, involves no guaranteed  price,  but to advocate such a system ss an alternative proposal which  will benefit the Dominions more directly  and more  certainly than  a tariff,  and v/ill moreover remove from the arena of discussion  the very troublesome question of the clumping of Russian -heat. I  must  press my colleagues most  earnestly to  make up their minds to this  course.  -           i- quota system for wheat  is  however an alternative only  to  the tariff proposals  of Canada  and, to  a less  degree,  of Australia.    ihat  alternatives can  we  offer to  the  proposals, likewise for a  preferential tariff  involving,  the  taxation  of  foodstuffs,  and  rawmaterials,  put forward  by  the  other Dominions?           I have  no  doubt  whatsoever that  in  the  firstplace it is essential that we  should put  an end to theexisting uncertainty as to the continuance of the preferences which we ct present accord  to a limited                        -3 -
 number of cemmod it ies produced wit hid the &quot;Empire.  It cannot be questioned that the foot that  e hove announced it  iss pert of our polio;/ to remove the toxes, ?nd v;ith thorn the preferences, as soon, c-s possible has a most depressinr effect on the industries- concerned in the Dominions:  no business could be carried on successfully with such on uncertainty.   If we really intended to oarry this deelar:tion into effect, I might hove nothing to say.  But every one of us knows that in fact we hove no intention of carrying it into effect within the neat three or  four yet. re at lesst.  Then why-, in the no me of coamonaease, should we not sty so?   Is it not plain folly to risk breaking up this Conference end thereby cutting our own political throats by refusing to soy what we and everyone else here know to be the truth, namely the t the preferences will certainly remain for the next few years - at least until the next Impel&apos;ial Conference?   V/a certainly stand to gain by making a concescion which costs us  nothing : nd is likely to be  effective as a bergcining counter.           On  this point also,  therefore,  I  most  earnestly ask  my colleagues to reach  a  decision forthwith.           These are  the two moot important  points for decision.   If  we  can ogrea  upon those,  as I greatly hopewe can  agree,  I  feel confident  that  .;e  can  build  up onthet..,  e  policy  which  //ill  give  us  a  real  chance of savingthe Conference,  or,  at  worst,  of  defending  ourselves  effectivelycr-pinst the charge that we  ourselves  have wrecked  it.          The  items  in  such a policy -would  be  cs  follows:-( 1)   -&apos;. quota system for hrqpire  wheat.
(2) A declaration that existing preferences will becontinued for the next few years .          I need acid nothing to what I have already saidregarding these two .(3) The above two items still leave unprovided for a numberof commodities in respect of which the Dominions have askedfor a tariff.   The chief of these are dairy products andcanned, goods.   Fo close examination hes yet &quot;been made, or could be made within the t i :e available, into the questionwhether any of the alternative policies - quota, bulk purchase,import boards, etc. - mentioned by the President of the Boardof Trade in his speech at the second eoonomic discussion ofthe Heads of Delegations are really applicable to these commodities, but I understand, that sub-Committees of theCommittee on Economic Co-operation have been set up to makea preliminary examination of this question.   I recommend that;subject to the reports of these sub-Committees, we should undertake to make a detailed examination preliminarily t o the summoning of a further Conference at Ottawa next year, intothe question of what means other than preferential tariffscan be found to secure a larger share for the Dominion pro-ducers of these commodities in the United kingdom market.(4) V&apos;e are urging upon the Dominions that as part of their contribution, to the increase of inter Imperial  trade theyshould undertake a  detailed examination, in conjunction withthe interests concerned;, of their own tariffs .   It  seems tome clear that we cannot asx them to do  this and  refuse to dothe same ourselves .   Suggestions have  at various times beenput forward for a  readjustment, within  existing limits, of the preferences accorded,  by us to  Dominion  products.  I am  aware that                        -  5  -
there are considerable difficulties in the way of effectingany such adjustments,, but I would urge my colleagues to agreeto a declaration that we shall be prepared to examine very carefully, and. with a real desire to be helpful, any suggestions which the Dominions may wish to make to us in these respects.(5) Finally my colleagues will remember the discussion which took place at the last economic meeting of Heads of Delegationsas to the Empire Marketing Board.   I understand that opinionon the Committee on Economic Co-operation and on the sub-Committeeof that Committee which has been sot- up to consider the futureof the hoard is declaring itself very solidly in favour of what i may call an &apos;* imperial! s at ion&quot; both of the Board and of thefurdc at its disposal .   ] y colleagues -will remember that onoof the things which we hoped would result from this conference was a system of inter-Imperial economic machinery;  and. Itelievo that our consent to &quot;imperialise&quot; the Empire MarketingBoard would not only he very welcome to the Dominions but would go far towards providing precisely the sort of permanent inter-Imperial economic machinery which we had in mind s   In order to achieve this purpose however I have no doubt that it will befound essential that we should agree that the fund should be constituted c trust fund, placed solely at the disposal (within their terms of reference) of an Imperial Board, and that weshould offer a fixed contribution to the fund for a term ofyears .   In return I have good reason to believe that theDominions would be ready to agree that so far as publicity isconcerned. - I am assuming that the remainder of the Board. &apos;s work would continue on the same lines as before -- the fund, should bo
 available for expenditure not only in the United Kingdom butjin  the Dominions.  It would of course have to be made clear  that nothing would bo done in this direction either here or there except at the request and in accordance with thov/ishos of the individual Governments; but if money were available to further the marketing of tJ.Eo goods in the Dominions as well as of Dominion produce here, this would be a definite advantage to us.   Moreover I am hopeful that one at least, if not more, of the Dominions would be prepared  itself to make a contribution to such a Trust Fund.      I should add that if a Trust fund were constituted on the linos indicated above, I think it would be worth while trying to  get some prominent figure in the life of the limp ire to act as Chairman of the  body adaini sterling it.      These, are the five  items which I suggest we should put forward as cur positive contribution to the economic co-operation which we hope  to establish by means cf this Conference,,    And I would point out  to my colleagues that not one of them,  with the possible  exception  of (5), commits us to one penny  of  additional  expenditure,,      ghat  dowe hope to  get in return?  First some  striking declaration by the  Imperial Conference in favour of economic co-operation  &quot;which,  I  suggest, would  of  itself  be  of no small political advantage to  ovir selves.    Secondly  and most important  the practical  revision  of Dominion  tariffs to which I have referred at (4)  above    There can be no possible doubt that  such a  revision would be  of  the  very greatest value to our export  trade.   The Dominions have made it clear that they mean  to protect their own industries^but  that,,  subject to that proviso, they are anxio\is, if
 dustrios,  by re-adjustment of the existing tariffs  is be- yoni doubt.    On the  other hand Ivlr.  Bennett and  General Hertsog have stated,  in very plain terms,  that if they re- ceivo no encouragement from the United Kingdom at this Conference towards  continued cc-operation  in the endeavour to  increase  inter-Imperial trade, &quot;they may find  it  imposs-T iblc  to  retain  their  existing preferences  to the United Kingdom.   That  nay well be a threat which public opinion might prevent them  from carrying out.   But it is a possibility,  the effects of which -  political as well as economic - I do  not care to contemplate.      We are within  days of the  end. of  the  ConferenceaTo  can no longer postpone  our decision.    It  is for thepurpose of malting it  clear that we not only have a policy on  the economic  side, but  that  that policy  is a  definite and practicable  one,  that  I  submit this memorandum,,                         (Intd) .
