THE COTTOH 3ITUATI0H.         Komorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs          and .the President of the Board of Trade: ;         1. .        Our colleagues will wish to receive a         report from us regarding the visit vc paid to Manchester         last week and the discussions which vc than had ,;rith         representatives of the various sections of the Lancashire                                                                           i         cotton industry.         2.          Under the auspices of the Joint Committee         of Cotton Trade Organisations, we held a series of         conferences during the whole of &quot;Wednesday and the early         part of Thursday with representative gatherings of the various         sections of the industry,. - spinners, manufacturers-, finishers,         operatives and merchants.  In addition, wo met leading         Lancashire Bankers and also the Executive of the Joint         Committee.  All these meetings wore of a private character         with no Press representatives present, and in these circum-         stances re were able to have full and frank discussions which         have enabled us te obtain at first hand the industry5s own         views on the problems with which it is no&quot; confronted.         3*          Our procedure with each body was to start         from the position in which matters wore loft when the         Homo Secretary presented the Report of the Cotton         Enquiry Committee to the general meeting of representatives         of the trade held in Manchester last July.  v&apos;re wished-1
to ascertain from tho sections what were their considered views upon the recommendations in the Report,  what stepsthey were taking to give effect to those recommendations and what obstacles might exist to further progress inthe directions indicated in the Report.4,          The President of the 1&apos;astor Spinners&apos; Federationroad to us a statement in which stress was laid upon the external causes which in the Federation&apos;s view are adver-scly affecting the industry.  In  this  connection  reference was male to our monetary policy,  the return to the GoldStandard, the fall in the price of  silver -&quot;ith itsreaction on trade with the Eastern  markets, the  lowerconditions of labour and longer hours  cf work in competingcountries, the raising of tariff  barriers against curcotton export trade, the burden of  taxation in thiscountry and the  disparity between wholesale and.  retail price s.          Ve pointed out to  the Deputation that  asregards these extraneous causes,  it wan impossible forus  in  the time at  our disposal  to enter into  anyadequate discussion  of  them;  i-,e made it clear thatwo  wished to  confine the discussion as far as possibleto  the problems  which, wore peculiar to the  cottoni ndu s try,          Another  representative  then  read a  lengthystatement of  the views which had  been  reached by anumber of Sub-Committees of  the Federation appointed
to consider specific problems referred to in the Report,The subjects dec It with were the use of short-stapledIndian cotton, the extended use of ring spindles, high-draft spinning, high-speed winding machinery, automaticand semi-automatic looms, amalgamations and finance, andco-operation with operatives end with other soctions ofemploy ers,5.         A representative gathering of the manufacturers,who stated to us the various problem- with which their sectionof the trade is faced.   The manufacturers followed the spinners in attributing a great deal of their misfortunes tothe extraneous causes which the latter body had mentioned(see paragraph 4) c          We found that apart from these matters thomain interest of the manufacturers at the present time isto secure arrangements with the operatives whereby thenumber of looms which a weaver looks after will beincreased, but we refrained from entering into discussion on this matter which is the subject of negotiations between the parties concerned,          v/e endeavoured to elicit from themanufacturors their views as to tho efficiency of thepresent organisation of their industry which appears tobe a rather haphazard collection of over 1,000individual concerns competing fiercely with each other for the reduced volume of business now available.   Wegathered that the majority of the manufacturers  arestill highly individualistic  in outlook and are  not atall favourably inclined, towards proposals for amalgama-tionc   On tho other hand, tbero is evidently a minoritywho are seriously concerned with their present andfuture position and are coming to the conclusion that the
4 ft military U 0  existing structure of their section cf the industry muihe overhauled and that the road to salvation lies in thedirection of amalgamation and the formation of largerana stronser unite.6.          At a luncheon with the leading LancashireBankers wo had a very interesting discussion in thecourse of which we elicited the views of the Bankingcojomunity on the situation.   The Bankers assured us thatthey were anxious and willing to do everything in their power to help in the restoration of the industry andthat any sound scheme for financial reconstruction would receive their whole-hearted support.    They were evidentlof opinion that the present organisation of the spinningand manufacturing sections in small competing units waswasteful and should he reviewed, and in this connectionthey reminded us of the support which they were giving to the  formation of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation.7.          The r epreoentatives of the three finishingtrades - bleachers, printers and dyers - each of whichis strongly organised, with,price-fixing arrangements -gave us their vie!.vs on the situation and they allreferred to the  extraneous causes dealt with by theother sections  (see paragraph 4.).   Also they allstressed the willingness of the finishers to co-operate-to the greatest possible ooxtent with other sections ofthe industry iii  any attempt to reduce the costs ofproduction.   They pointed out that the present organisa-tion cf the manufacturing section in small units made itimpossible for them to secure the benefit of &quot;long runs&quot;and so to reduce the cost of their services.
 8.         Vo  met the representatives of. the operatives and had  a  thoroughly  interesting and useful discussion with  them.   Their spokesman made it clear that the operatives wore  vitally  interested in the prosperity of the industry  on which their  livelihood depended. They  pointed out, however,  that they did not own the industry and were not able  to  control its operations. They  wore  not  satisfied  that the present organisation was efficient, at any rate  in certain respects. They  favoured  the formation of  bigger and stronger units among  the  spinners and manufacturers and they stressed tho need for improvement in the technical equipment  of the industry and in the marketing methods. The;-  agreed  that the  costs  of production in Lancashire were t oo high, but they  said that the;&apos;&quot; V/CPG not prepared to entertain a ny proposal for a reduction of the present scale of the operatives&apos;  pay until they were satisfied that  the employers themselves were economically and efficiently  oi^ganisedo 9.         At  a  dinner in the evening with the Executive  of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations, we had &apos;a  most interesting discussion, mainly on the  vexed Question of amalgamations in the industry.    7o found  that there were strikingly divergent views held on  this matter, but  on the whole we feel that the balance  of advantage must lie with tho bigger unit.As it seems  to us, the only alternative to proceeding with the policy  of amalgamation is a continuance of thopresent  attrition by bankruptcy, which must mean a  long-drawn-out agony for Lancashire.D .         On Thursday morning we mot/ .
 the  representatives  ox&quot;  the merchants.    The  extraneous - causes affecting  the industry,  of which we  had already heard from  the  other sections  (see paragraph 4) were  again mentioned,  and again we pointed  out  that those questions raised very large issues, some of which  were clearly  outside Government  control.          As to the  views of  the merchants en the problems of the industry itself,  we gathered  that they consider the sole  cause  of the present depression to  he in the fact that Lancashire  costs  of  production ax-e too high.   They claimed that  the Handlester  merchant ing  system is extremely efficiera they  pointed out  that they have  a world-wide system of in- formation which is always at the disposal of the trade; and an intimate knowledge cf local conditions in foreign  markets, In conclusion they definitely  stated to  us that if they could only  get  the goods at the  proper price their organisa- tion  would  not have  the least  difficulty in  selling in the mar-kets of  the world all the goods that  Lancashire could possibly produce. 11c   Dulling these cliscussions we were asked, more than ence, the Government&apos;s  views on  compulsion;  in reply, we contented ourselves  with pointing out that any suggestion of governmental compulsion at  present could  only have the effect cf shutting down  all voluntary activity in thedirection ef  re-crganisation, but that should the industry show no activity  itself, the Government  could not merely stand. by and  look on at  the spectacle&quot;^ of the industry sinking further and  further into  barucruptcy,,   The imme-diate need,  therefore, was for the industry  to take every possible step.12.       At  each of  these meetings  it became clear that tire complex and  technical matters put before us  cculd net be adequately  considered during the ljnxtea time available
 for  discussion,  and it  was therefore  agreed  in every  case that the  meeting should he regarded as  adjourned until  such time as we  had had an opportunity&apos; of  digesting the  evidence presented to us,  and that further meetings with each  of the sections  should  he arranged,  either in  Iianchester or  London as might  he most convenient,  at  the earliest possible date. &quot;,7e suggested,  and it was agreed,  that such meetings should he confined to some half-dozen chosen representatives in each case,  as  large gatherings were clearly  unsuitable  for the  tack  of getting to  grips  with problems of the kind raised, loo       The  general conclusion  we have reached as a result of all these preliminary conferences  is  that Lancashire  is becoming  to learn by bitter experience  that  the individual and  highly  secticnalised organisation  of the cotton industry  which has worked so  successfully in the past,  is no longer suited  to  modern conditions,.   The lessons  of  the Cotton Report  are  being slowly learned  and there is evidence of a  desire among  all sections towards  greater co-operation,, There is, of course,  in each  section  the human tendency  toput  the blame  for  their troubles  on to  such  extraneousmatters as  monetary policy,  labour conditions abroad and the like, or on  to the  other  sections, rather than toagree that  there   is any need to put  their own house  in order,, 140       We are convinced, however,  that the co-operative sense is  growing and we believe that  our meetings have done something to help  its growth,,    The Joint Committee of cotton trade Organisations  is  the first  truly representative body
112-t- financial which the industry has ever produced,  inasmuch  as  it  includes net  only all  sections of  the  employers, hut all  sections Of                                              - -   &quot;   &quot; the  operatives  as wello    Our meet ins s  have teen held,  under the  ausoices  of this tody  and. we  think  that the  Government should give its efforts vevery encouragement,,    The further   meetings that we  propose  to have with  the  industry will he held, under the auspices of the  Joint  Committee,  and we &quot;believe that by this means the Government  can be  of assistance in encouraging  and. expediting  the  re-organisa- tion which is so essential,. 15.       The problems involved, are very  difficult  and will require careful handling.   As we  have indicated,Lancashire is by no means unanimous on  the highly important question  of amalgamations  although  the  weight of opinion seems to be that, if amalgamations are  to come,  they should proceed horizontally in a given section  rather  thanvertically throughout the -industrial;/^ and. be accompanied byany necessary working arrangements between the variousvariety in t he needs of the different markets and. the goods to be produced for them, that further and most carefulconsideration must be given to these questions as well  asto the allied question of the financial relations betweenthe City and the cotton industry,,groups.So comp1ex is the industryand. s o great the
and urged that the Government should take every practicalstep to put an end to the existing state of affairs which,in their view, is doing irreparable harm to Lancashire.On this matter we pointed out the many difficulties thatexist in the way of Government action at the present timep                                   atall we could do .was to promise that/the forthcoming RoundTable Conference the important interests of Lancashirein relation to India would certainly not be  overlooked.(Intd),    J.R.
