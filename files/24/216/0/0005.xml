The Government Members cf tho  British Delegation to the           Round Table Conference held their  first meeting yesterday,           and decided to  submit to the Cabinet  their recommendations           on the  publication  of the Government  of India&apos;s Despatch on           the Simon Report.

The Meeting had before it the Secretary ofState for India&apos;s Memorandum (S.D.G.(30) 2) summarising the outstanding points of the Government of India&apos;despatch, and discussing the question of its publication,.The Meeting were informed that very few copies of theDespatch had been received, and that some time would pass before enough copies were available for publication,if resolved upon,       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR UiDIA touched upon the differences of opinion, between the Government of Indiaand the Simon Commission, set out in paper B*D.C-V (50) 2.If he had to put the matter in a sentence, ho would say,broadly, that the Delhi Government were more conservativethan the Commission on questions of extended franchise,the position of women, etc, and more liberal on  questionsof constitutional development-       MR, WEDGV/QOD BENK said that Lord Irwin was infavour of the publication of the Despatch: and that lord reading had already asked for a copy.   He went on to describe two contingencies in which publication would be embarrassing.  The first would be if Indian Nationalistopinion made use of the two documents (the Simon report and the Despatch) in order to make an illogical claim tothe advantages of both; or to use the &quot;advance&quot; alreadyconceded in the Despatch as the stopping-stone to furtherdemands from the Conference; the second, if the conference were to result In the Government of India&apos;R views being found in opon opposition to British opinion, led by HisMajesty&apos;s Government a
The Government Members agreed  : -  (a) that it YTOvild be Imp cs sib &quot;to to      refuse publication,, which should      take place before the opening of      the Conference  It should be made      clear that the Despatch ?&apos;as      published for general information,      and that no British. Government      endorsement was implied for it, any      more than such endorsement had been      given or implied for the Simon      Report e  (b) that it would be undesirable to      define the Government - s  attitude      in answer to Parliamentary questions,      or otherwise.  (o) that this item of the Meeting&apos;s      Conclusions should be reported to      the Cabinet.  -(d) that advance copies of the Despatch      might- be given, in strict confidence.,      to Lord Reading and Lord Poelc

The  Government  of  Indians  despatch  on Constitutional Reform of  which a copy  is  attached;  reached  London on  IQth Cctober.   It  is a&apos; document needing  careful study by all of us; but  I  think it rill  be  useful to my  colleagues at this  stage if I explain  very briefly  the extent to ^hich the Government of India do or do not endorse the recommendations of the Indian Statutory  Cormicsion.  I confine myself to points of the first  importance.           2.   Broadly speaking, the  Government of India accept the vhole  of  the  Commission&apos;s scheme  for the future constitution in the  Governor&apos;s  provinces, though  they throm considerable doubt  on the  practicability  of making much use of the Governor&apos;s potter  to appoint  an  official Minister.           It  is worth noting that they  appear to be willing to ccnoede rather more  than the Commission to Moslems as regards their representation in the Punjab and  Bengal Legislatures; and that they .adopt  a rather more &quot;conservative&quot; attitude than the Commission on  such matters as franchise  (especially as regardswomen)  and representation  in the provincial Legislatures (particularly  as regards Landholders).          3.   They advocate a distinctly more advanced form of constitution in the  Hortil Test Frontier Province than the                                                    Commission,
 Commission,  though their proposals are far from clear on the important  point  of the  degree of  responsibility of the North West  Frontier province  &quot;minister&quot; - one official - to the Provincial Legislature.        -  4. They throv; grave doubts on the suitability cf the Commission&apos;s scheme  for constituting the Lower House of the Central Legislature  by  means of indirect election by the Provincial Legislatures, though they do not finally com it themselves on the subject. They contemplate a rather smaller increase in the  size of the lower house, and would keep a higher proportion of officials in it than the Commission (a maximum cf 26 out of a  total of 200 as against the Commissions 12 out of 25C-280)o           p* As  regards&apos; the Central Executive and its relations to the Central Legislatures they claim that they do not reject the Commissions scheme, but develop it somewhat, in the sense ofhastening the  pace by contemplating the immediate and formal adoption of a position which would very probably bo reached under the Commission&apos;s proposals before very long though not at once.          The Commission (Volume 2, Part IV, Chapters 2 and 3) definitely decline to -countenance any formal transfer of responsibility at the Centre, but pave the v/ay for it hereafterby giving the Governor-General power to appoint his own Cabinet,and by expressing a hope that prominent elected members of theLegislature will be  selected to sit in the Governor-General&apos;s &quot;Cabinet&quot;.   The Government of India would at once draw aconsiderable proportion of the Governor-General&apos;s Cabinet from thatsource. They  do not propose, anymore than the Commission,that the elected members should be legally responsible tothe Legislature or should be in any way removable by theLegislature,  but they,  and indeed the whole Governor-General1sCouncil,  would be far more  &quot;responsive&quot;  to the Legislature  than                                                     under
 under the  Commission&apos;s  scheme  owing  to  the  definite change which the  Government  of India  advocate  in the  relations between the Grovornnontof  India  on the  one hand  and  the  Secretary of State and  Parliament  on the other.           6.  This  important difference  &quot;between the proposals of  the Government  of  India and the Commission  reaches its logical  development in  the Sever men t of India&apos;s proposals in respect  of the  position of the Secretary of  State and Parliament. The  degree to which the Indian Executive, whether formally responsible to  the Indian Legislature or not,  does in fact become  responsible to it depends of  course  on  the extent to which they are  actually controlled,  or  even  subject to control, by  the  Secretary of Stats and  Parliament.   The  Commission, while in favour of less and less control from  London, do not recommend  any declaration by Parliament that it will hoep its hands  off  any central subject  except, as now,  tariffs; contemplating apparently, that parliamentary control should die,  if  at all, by degrees and through  loch  of  use.  The Government of India on  the other hand recommend that Parliament should forthwith declare that  it will only  intervene (through the  Secretary of State)  for certain  stated  purposes.  These are  tentatively set out  in paragraph 225 of  &quot;the despatch andmay be briefly  summarised as defence, foreign relations, internal security,  financial obligations, financial stability, protection of minorities,  and of the rights of  services recruited by the Secretary  of-State, and  the prevention  of unfair discrimination.           They  contemplate that for  all other  purposes, the Government of India should in  fact,  and by the terms of the Governor-Generalrs Instrument  of Instructions, carry out theviews of the Indian Legislature;  thoy would not be removableby it and  not in constitutional form nresponsible&quot;.  They suggest  that portfolios  chiefly concerned with the subjects forwhich Parliament retains a power of  intervention should                                                remain
remain in the hands ofAembers of the Governor-General&apos;s &quot;Cabinet&quot;who v/ill still be officials.  (It is a difficulty in their scheme - though not insuperable - that the &quot;purposes&quot; forwhich Parliament might still intervene do not necessarilycoincide with the division into administrative &quot;subjects&quot; onwhich a distribution of portfolios must be based).  In fact -and this is the essential point - the Government of India&apos;s plan for the Central Government is very like the &quot;dyarchic&quot; system which has been in force for the last ten years in the Provinces.          7-  The Government of India would no longer reta.inthe Secretary of  State&apos;s Council in the form of a statutory body with statutory powers of veto. What they contemplate isa body of advisers for certain purposes.          8. The Government of India reject the Commission&apos;splan of removing &quot;defence&quot; from the control of the Governmentof India and placing it under the Governor-General.   TheCommission themselves only recommend this if it is acceptable to Indian opinion.  If this condition were, contrary toexpectation.; to be fulfilled the Government of India &quot;would beready to reconsider the question.          The Government of India do, however, a prove of one particular element in the Commission&apos;s scheme namely theproposal that the amount to be expended from Indian revenues on defence should be a fixed annual amount, subject only to periodicrevision.  The  doption of such a proposal would inevitably lead to placing a further financial burden on this country.          9.  The Government of India are in general agreementwith the Commission on the problem of the Indian States,the separation of Burma, the relations between the Central and provincial Executives, the financial relations between centre and Provinces (though they regard the estimates of theCommission^ Financial Assessor as too optimistic), and onthe position of the Services.
                                                               25           10.   is a development of the proposals mentioned  under 6j  the Government of India make a recommendation on a  subject  on which the Commission is silent.  They propose  a change in the present legal  and constitutional position under which  the governing of India, for the Crown, vests primarily in  the Secretary of State in Council,  the Government  of India being in theory, though net in practice, almost in the  position of &quot;agents&quot; They  propose that in future the government should  be vested, for the Crown,  directly in the Governor-General  and the Governors, though these authorities would  be subject, in  certain respects,  to the  control of the Secretary of State.           This question is one  rather of constitutional doctrine and &quot;status&quot; rather than of direct practical importance.           11.   It is already well known that the Government of India  have  delivered themselves of their views.  Before long both  the  delegates to the Round T.?ble Conference and Parliament and the public will rant to know what these  views  are.   (The first  to  ask.will,  naturally, be the  Conservative  and  Liberal r-l pi p^ato^           The  precise moment at which the despatch should be released  is  one of some  importance which I will not discuss here.   But  there  is a preliminary point of great:&quot;moment to  be settled.   I  should regard it as a  disaster if wo disclosed  thedespatch without much previous  consideration, and  subsequently found  that there  were&quot;really vital points  on which we,  as HisMajesty&apos; s. Government, were fundamentally at  variance with theGovernment of  India.   I  do  not  desire  that we should attempt to see if 7.-Q agree with  the  Government of  India on all points,  ortry to make  up  our minds  in advance of  the Hound Table Conferencewhether the  Commission&apos;s  proposals as modified by  theGovernment of  India will  altogether fill the bill;&apos; but I dowant to be sure that  we approach  the problems before us with mindsmore or less in harmony with the Government  of India and                                                   especially
 especially that we are not eventually going to  take  up  the position that their proposals are so &quot;advanced&quot; or possibly so unworkable that they cannot be seriously  considered.           12.  From this point of view,  the important feature in these proposals is that they involve on  the one hand a  definite rejection of the Commission^ refusal to  contemplate  at this stage any formal transfer of responsibility at  the Centre,  and on the ether hand a definite preparedness,  despite the Commission^ advocacy to the contrary, to agree to what is  in effect a form of dyarchy designed to secure such a transfer. forthwith.   Wy are not,  I think,  at the moment  concerned with the precise  character of such a scheme but merely with the  question whether  we  are ready to  contemplate something of the  kind. If in the course of the  Hound Table Conference  discussions  it appears  that an effective and lasting settlement with Indian opinion  couldbe reached  on these  lines,  it  would afford a  very strong argument for accepting such a plan.  But  apart from this my own view is that on  the merits it  is well  worth considering and if my colleagues  agree with me  on this  point, I  see no  difficulty in informing  the Cons-eivative and Liberal delegates at once  and in confidence of. the  Government of India1s views and of our general attitude  to them.          13-  is regards making available to Indian delegates - and  if this is done necessarily publishing  simultaneously - the Government  of  India&apos;s Despatch, the members  of my Council are strongly&apos;opposed to  this at all events until the  Conference has met,  on  the ground that  the disclosure of the recommendations in it would be embarrassing.ButI regard it as impossible  to attempt to suppress                  a document of  this  character and importance,  the  existence  of which is well  known.W.B.10th October 1930
