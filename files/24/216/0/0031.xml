APPLICATION OF RUSSIAN OIL PRODUCTS LIMITED.380(30)         FOR ENROLMENT ON THE KING&apos;S ROLL._Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the          Minister of Labour.     At a meeting held on Thursday,  the Sth November,  (cabinet conclusions 66(30), Conclusion 11) the Cabinet asked theMinister of Labour to make further enquiries into the applicationof the Russian Oil Products Limited, more particularly as to the truth of the reports that the Company were discharging theirBritish employees and engaging more Russians and that they were able to introduce Russians without obtaining a certificate fromthe Ministry of Labour.     As regards the first suggestion, enquiries have been madeby the Home Office.  These show &quot;that during the six months ended the 30th September last the total staff increased from 1,192 to1,337 and the number of Russians included in these totals from46 to 49.  Almost all of the Russians are employed in the head office of the Company in London.  Recent staff changes have not shown any striking tendency towards the replacement of Britishsubjects by Russians, but rather the substitution of men (british or Russian) who are politically &quot;sound&quot; from the Communist pointof view in place of those who possess business qualificationsbut are not reliable &quot;party men&quot;.     As regards the second suggestion, it has been a long es-tablished arrangement that Ministry of Labour permits are notissued in oases where Russians are coming here to join theRussian Oil Products Limited or other Soviet commercial under-takings.  Visas are authorised by the Secretary of State afterany necessary enquiries and are specially marked &quot;Anglo-russian trade&quot;.  The holders of suoh visas are given leave to land on acondition limiting the length of their stay in this country.
13th November,  1930.     During the six months (1st April,  1950,  to 50th September,1930) 322 visas have been authorised for Soviet citizens  cominghere in connection with Anglo-Soviet trade,  either as businessvisitors or to join the Staff of Soviet Organisations in  theUnited Kingdom.  For the month of October,  1930, 40 visas were authorised for this purpose.  Out of the 322 visas authorisedduring this period of 6 months, 14 were in respect of Sovietcitizens for whom&quot;application was made by the Soviet Governmentto join the Staff of Russian Oil Products Limited, thecorresponding figure for October being two.     The Cabinet also asked whether there is any previous case where a foreign director of a company which has been put  on theKing&apos;s Roll has signed the Declaration of Loyalty.  On this pointthere appears to be a misapprehension.  It is in the RoyalProclamation establishing the King&apos;o Roll - a copy of  whichwas attached to CP. 373(30) that reference is made to &quot;Ourloyal subjects&quot; and &quot;patriotic employers&quot;.  The undertaking tobe made on the prescribed form --(see copy and explanatoryleaflet attached) for enrolment under the King&apos;s Roll Schememerely relates to the employment of a certain proportion of dis-abled ex-Servioe men.  The undertaking would, of course,  be signed by the Secretary of a Company.     It should perhaps be added that in other oases no account has been taken of the nationality of the Directorate.  Indeedso long as the requisite  employment is given to disabled ex-Service men in this country, an application from a foreignfirm would not be regarded as  outside the Bcope of the Roll.

MINISTRY   OF   LABOUR.National  Scheme  for the  Employment, on a Percentage             Basis,   of  DISABLED  Ex-Service Men.                            kings  NATIONAL ROLL.    1.  The object of the Scheme is to absorb  into employment all DISABLED ex-Service men;  andto secure  their equitable distribution among the several industries.    2.  For the purposes of the  Scheme a disabled ex-Service man is any man who having served inH.M. Forces between 4th Augii3t, 1914, and 11th November, 1918 :       (a) Is in receipt of a disability pension, or has had one while in his present employment, or has had            a permanent disability pension commuted by the Ministry of Pensions, or      (&amp;) Has received from the Ministry of Pensions a disability gratuity and is adjudged by the Local            Committee to be incapacitated wholly or in part from following his normal occupation, or      (c)  Is a trainee under the Industrial Training Scheme for the training of Disabled Ex-Service Men,            or having completed training under that Scheme, continues in the employment of the firm            with whom he was a trainee (whether still in receipt of a disability pension or not).    3.  The Scheme is administered locally by the King&apos;s Eoll Committees or Local Employment Com-mittees to whom applications to enrol should be submitted on the prescribed form of Undertaking.    4.  Employers are asked to employ as many disabled ex-Service men  as possible and not less  than an agreed percentage, normally 5, though in certain trades a lower percentage has been agreed as applic-able.  The Local Committees are empowered to consider applications for enrolment on the basis of a percentage less than 5 where special circumstances render this necessary.    5.  If the application is accepted, a Certificate is issued through the Local Committee, the employer&apos;s Name is entered upon the King&apos;s  National Roll, and he becomes entitled to use on his letter paper, etc.,the  special device of the National Scheme (shown at the head of this leaflet) until such time as the Certi-ficate for  any reason is withdrawn.  It may be withdrawn at any time if the terms of the Undertakingare  not observed, and it is issued on the understanding that the holder will give the Local Committee any reasonable information required in order to see that the conditions of the Undertaking are being fulfilled.    6.  The Ministry of Labour  do not supply or loan blocks of the device of the Scheme.  Gummedwafers bearing the device may be  obtained at the nearest Employment Exchange for temporary use while a block is in course of preparation.    7.  In  the case  of a firm owning branch establishments or controlling subsidiary firms, a compre-honsive Undertaking should be given by the Head Office covering the total employees involved.   The per-centage of disabled ex-Service men will be based upon the number of employees taken as a whole and itis not essential that each branch or subsidiary  firm should be employing that percentage although eachbranch or subsidiary firm would  be entitled to the privileges of enrolment.  The negotiations will becarried cut by the Local Committee in whose area the Head Office is situated.    8.  When an Undertaking under the scheme has been in existence for two years the position is re-viewed before the enrolment is renewed.    9.  The Roll contains the names of His Majesty the  King, His Majesty&apos;s Treasury (on behalf of all government  Departments and  Government  Industrial  Establishments), leading  Local Authorities,Public  Bodies (e.g., Gas, Electricity, Water and Harbour Authorities), Banks, Railway Companies, andmost of the large industrial and commercial undertakings in the Country.    10.  The following Resolution was passed in both Houses of Parliament on 16th February, 1926 :           &quot; That, in the  opinion of this House, it is the duty  of the Government in all Government      Contracts  to make provision for the employment to the fullest possible extent of disabled ex-      Service men, and to this end to confine such contracts, save in exceptional circumstances, to em-      ploy ers enrolled on the  ELing&apos;s National Roll.&quot;    The principle laid down in this Resolution is also followed by the Government of Northern Irelandand by a number of the Dominion and Colonial Governments when placing contracts in this  country.A number of  Local Authorities and Public bodies in Great Britain also restrict contracts to firms on theRoll.     11.  Attention is drawn to the Government Scheme under  which employers can be relieved of any additional liability under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation  Acts which  the  employment of disabled  ex-Servico men may entail.  Details of this Scheme may be obtained on application to the Local Committee.     12.  The form of Undertaking should be  forwarded when completed to the Secretary of the LocalCommittee  at the nearest Employment Exchange,  who will be pleased to give any further informationdesired.
