COPY No2P/.C/P.365,(30) .               CABINET.                           r                   IN TERM AT ION AL LABOUR CONFERENCE.                        TENTH SESSION - 1937.         PROPOSED ACTION. ON DRAFT CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.                 MBlAORANDUla BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.              I submit for the consideration of my colleagues the         following proposals as to the action to he taken by the         Government in regard to the Draft Conventions and Recommenda-         tions adopted by the Tenth Session of the International         Labour Conference.   The texts of these documents have         already been presented to parliament as Command 2961 of 1927.         (1)   DRAFT CONVENTION CONCERNING SICKNESS,. INSURANCE. FOR              WO&apos;RI03RS&quot;3N INDUSTRY AND&apos; COiaiLRCE AND DOMESTIC&quot; SERVANTS.         (2)   DRAFT CONVENTION CONCERNING SICKNESS INSURANCE FOR              AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.              The slight amendment of our Health Insurance Acts,         necessary to bring them into conformity with the requirements         of these Conventions, was made some time ago.   Ratification         was, however, held up by the situation in Northern Ireland         where a different system of medical treatment was in opera-         tion.   The National Health Insurance Act (Northern Ireland)         1930 provides,  inter alia, for the  extension of medical         benefit to Northern Ireland on lines corresponding  to  those         in operation in Great Britain, and  I am informed by the         Ministry of Health that the new  sjstem of medical benefit         actually became operative  as from 1st October,  1930.   There         is,   therefore,  now no obstacle to our ratification  of  these         Conventions and I suggest  that I be authorised  to apply  for         the  necessary Order of Council and  communicate  the  ratifica-         tions to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.
28th October, 1930.(3)  EjOOl^jjNDAJigj CONCERNING THE GENERAL PRBIOIPLES OF     SICKNESS INSURANCE.     There is no objection to the terms of this recommendation and it is proposed, therefore, to accept it.                                  (Intd.)  M. G.B.
