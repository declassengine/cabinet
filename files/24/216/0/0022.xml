THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1930.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON  BUDGETARY  AND HORSE-POWER LIMITATION.  Supplementary Report on Article 1 G of the Draft Disarmament Convention.    1.  The Admiralty  brought  to notice  the following Article 1 G of the DraftDisarmament Convention:           &quot;Each  of the  High  Contracting  Parties  shall  communicate  to  the    Secretariat of the League of Nations the  name  and tonnage of any vessel    constructed in accordance with Article NH (Chapter  II*)  with regard to    existing vessels of this type.  This communication shall be made within  two    months after ratification of the present convention.   With  regard  to vessels to-    be constructed, the communication shall be made on the date of completion.&quot;to which it appears  strong objection is taken  and  which was  embodied in  a reservation at the First Reading in 1927.    2.  In view of the shortness of time, the Chairman of the Committee agreed thatthe point should be discussed, although lying outside the terms of reference, in orderthat the Cabinet might be able to consider it at an early date.    3.  The Admiralty contend that the scope of the Disarmament Convention tends to be limited to material available at the outbreak of war. without mobilisation  andthat, in  consequence, references to the mercantile marine as an element in &quot;war potential &quot;  should be omitted as, in fact,  are many other elements of  a somewhat similar nature.    4.  It was further explained that the information  required would only applyto merchant ships strengthened under the terms of the Washington Treaty,- that is, -by definite order and  subsidy of a Government; whereas, in practice, many firms.either strengthened their ships for their own purposes  or were  made to strengthenthem by Governments without subsidy.  The operation of this Article would be veryunequal  therefore, especially as the War Office, for example, were  not required tosubmit a return of subsidised commercial road vehicles which were just as essentialto the Army in war as merchant  ships to the Navy.    5.  We have come to  the conclusion that,  since  the  amount spent by  theAdmiralty on subsidising merchant shipping firms for  this purpose is negligible  2,500 iii 1930; and since  any returns must be misleading because they will not include ships strengthened without a subsidy, no point will be served  by the inclusionof this Article especially as no similar return is required of subsidised commercialroad vehicles which are in the same relation to the Army as merchant ships to theNavy.Recommendation.    6.  We recommend, therefore, that  the  United  Kingdom  delegates  to  thePreparatory Commission should be instructed to oppose the insertion of Article 1 Gin the Draft Disarmament Convention.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,           November 3, 1930.   * Article NH reads as follows: &quot; No preparations shall be made in merchant ships in time of peace forthe installation of warlike armaments for the purpose of converting such ships into vessels of war, other thanthe necessary stiffening- of decks for the mounting- of guns not exceeding 6 inches (152 millimetres) calibre;l.
