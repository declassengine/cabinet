Tbe jirga were,as the Chief Commissioner points out, in a hopeless position for negotiation since theirreconcilable &quot; Khilafatist&quot; party  were behind them, preventing them from coming to terms with Government.     29th October 1930.                 Extract from Situation Report, 19th October 1930.   Assistant Political  Officer saw combined jirga of  maliks and  elders  to-day atJamrud and Political Agent subsequently saw maliks alone.   Afridis, when called onto explain  reason for  their  attacks on  Peshawar in  June  and  August, laid stress on their grievances over the Shiah  Sunni settlement.   They added that as Governmentbad chosen to side with the enemies of the Afridis in that, quarrel, so the Afridis hadelected to side with tbe enemies of Government in their quarrel with Congress.  Asregards the finding  of a  solution for tbe menace from the  Khajuri  and Aka KbelPlains, the Afridis said that we ought not to punish them, but ought to punish ourown subjects  in  the Peshawar district,  who sheltered, clothed and fed the Afridisduring their  incursions.   While&apos;jirga was  being held, some five or  six  hundredKhilafatists were reported to be  in Chora  Nullah at Tangi above  Qadanr awaitingresult of negotiations.   Afridi  maliks protested  that troops ought not to make anyreconnaissance over Khajuri Plain while jirga was being held.                 Extract from Situation Report, 2Qth October 1930.   Political Agent,  Khyber, saw combined jirga at  Jamrud to-day and  explainedhistory of Governments case against  tribe  to jirga.   When  called  on to  answer for attack of 4th June, Afridi representatives attributed  it primarily to dissatisfactionover Shiah Suuni settlement and secondarily to agitation by propagandists from India.They had  no particular reply to give regarding incursion  of 8th August.  Wheninformed of determination of Government to  prevent repetition of  such incursions  infuture and  called on  to  suggest any remedy of their own, they  said they would consider matter  and  reply  to-morrow,  Tuesday.   Khilafatists  at  Tangi  in ChoraNullah have sent in letters threatening  to  attack troops unless  Government, makesearly satisfuctory settlement.                 Extract from Situation Report, 21st October 1930.

About mid-day reports were received of  firing in Khajuri Plain,which proved to be long-range  firing by  small body of Khilafatists. on  a cavalryreconnaissance covering surveying party.  Jirga was much disturbed, but reassembledin Jamrud village and continued discussion with Political Agent.  Their attitude wasroughly one of non possumus, and they had no alternative suggestions to put forward.They will be seen again to-morrow by Political Agent.  .

                 Extract from Situation Report, 22nd October, 1930.    Political Agent saw some of individual maliks and their sections  to-day, but  inafternoon maliks jointly said they could see no prospect of settlement.   Their onlysuggestion regarding prevention of future incursions into Peshawar district was thatthey should execute a form of bond undertaking that the tribe would not invade again.They could not suggest any security as backing for this  bond.  They were, told that orders  would  be  given them  to-morrow  morning.  In  meantime, Khilafatists  were reported to be increasingly restive in Tangi and at western end of  Khajuri Plain andto  be planning one or more  attacks for to-night.   Some Khilafatist leaders  with about a thousand  followers are reported  near Tauda China, and  another lot underseveral Mullahs were said to be onKarawal Hill in centre  of Khajuri Plain.  Althoughtroops in Khajuri made no reconnaissances far afield from their camps, some parties of  Khilafatists attempted to  harass  troops in  vicinity  of Sam  Ghakai Pass.  no casualties.  From Government of India, Foreign and  Political Department, to  Secretary of State                           for India, 24t7i October 1930.    3538  S.    North-West  Frontier  telegraphs,  22nd   October, No.   293 L. :-&quot; Continuation  of  my  situation report of this  evening.   Further details regardingattitude of jirga  at Jamrud are that all  maliks and elders agreed in asserting thatthey could not possibly consent to surrender of  any portion of Khajuri Plain even tolimited control by posts and  roads.  Although  they seem to want a settlement theyhave  shown  no sign of  suggesting  any alternative to scheme to satisfy our require-ments.   At same  time they have  also shown  no inclination  to drop their cardinaldemand for  undertaking  by us to withdraw from all interference or intervention inShiah Orakzai affairs.  Their position is  frankly hopeless  because they have not hadthe courage so far  to voice the remaining demands which Khilafatists have laid downas  sine qua non for settlement, viz. release of political prisoners, repeal of Sarda Actand Ordinances, restoration of  control  of the Khyber, &amp;c.   Thus, jirga has elected  totake its stand on blank refusal to consider any  demand of Government.  Khilafatists,after  attacking our cavalry yesterday, expected jirga to be broken off at once, and this afternoon have been discussing attack on Ninth Brigade camp and on other troops nearBara.   They have  also talked of sending  one or more  bodies to north of Jamrud roadwith  a view  to attacking some part of cantonments.  If  they commit  themselvesto-night there will  probably be no legitimate grounds for  further report from Jamrudto-morrow ; otherwise  I hope to  go  to  Jamrud myself to obtain jirga&apos;s  reply  inwriting, and also to repeat warning to them that opposition to troops or hostilities  inany form will  lay their  country open to aerial attacks after jjreseribed period.&quot;  From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of Stale                           for India, 24th October 1930.   3541 S.  Following from North-West  Frontier, 23rd October, 295 L. :-   &quot; Last night  passed  uneventfully.  Khilafatists in Tangi were reported to  have announced that they would not take offensive .till mid-day  to-day pending result ofmy interview  with jirga.  1 saw  jirga of maliks  and elders totalling about 400 atJamrud, and explained situation  to them in all its aspects.&quot;  They had  recorded inwriting their excuse  for  raid  on  Peshawar, namely, dissatisfaction over Shiah-Sunnisettlement and unrest in other parts of frontier and India.   They expressed inability to agree  to any roads or  posts  oh Khajuri-Aka Khel  Plain, but  only alternativesafeguard they could  suggest was a bond undertaking not to repeat the incursions.For two hours to-day I dealt with,  them, appealing to  them to suggest some reasonable solution which would save their   tribe  from  the disastrous  results of hostility toGovernment.   Maliks and elders were extremely friendly and appeared grateful, but expressed inability either to comply with our terms or to suggest alternative.   we discussed  frankly the Sunni-Shiah settlement, and I pointed out distorted version offacts which they had put forward.   I also referred to futility of demanding the releaseof Gandhi and other political  prisoners.  The fact is obvious that they know thatGovernment  cannot accept the demands of the Khilafatists, and that the latter areconsequently bent on hostilities.   It is therefore easier for them to refuse to agree toour opening up Khajuri  Plain than for them to side with us and defy Khilafatists.&quot;
Extract from Situation lieporl, 23rd October 1930.   Chief Commissioner saw Afridi jirga of maliks and elders at Jamrnd to-day for two hours, and discussed situation with them.   Jirga were  unable to suggest any alternative to construction of  roads and posts in Khajuri and Aka Khel Plains, but said  frankly that they  could  not agree to  such constructions.  Jirga broke up andelders  are believed  to  be returning  to  Tirah.  Khilafatists  have  summoned all available  reinforcemeuts  to  Khajuri  Plain.    Working party was  fired ou  this afternoon  and  Narai Khwar post was sniped this evening.                Extract from Situation Beport, 2Mi October 1930.   Some hundreds of Khilafatists still  reported to  be  in  cave area at western endof Khajuri Plain.  Bulk of Khilafatists  reported to have returned to Tirah to discussoffensive action.  Aerial reconnaissance to-day  failed to find  any jirga  at  Bagh  or elsewhere in Alaidan.  No other activities reported to-day.
