Memorandum by tho Mir: aitey of Health and the President                    o f The goar a of&quot; aOu oat ion.             This Bill,  introduced &quot;by Col. Watts-Morgan, is down for   second reading on Friday 28th November.  It follows the Nationality   of Women Bill, and may not be reached, but oiroumstancss may   necessitate some statement of the Government&apos;s attitude towards it.             She Bill has not  .yet been circulated, but It is   understood to be substantially identical with the Bill introduced   by Miss Bondfield in December 1928.   In that case it will   provide that -      (a) Power shall be given to public health authorities (in   respect of children under sohool age), and to looal education   authorities (in respect of ohildren attending public elementary   schools),  to provide  footwear for necessitous ohildren within   areas  iii which, in the view of the Minister of Health ci&quot; Board of   Education respectively acute  distress prevails.      (b) A grant  in aid of 90 per cent, shall be  paid by the Treasury.      (o) The Bill will only operate until December  31at 1931.             The Bill oreates new  charges, and it  cannot therefore   prooaed beyond  second reading unless the Government introduce and   give  time for a financial resolution.   The Bill  would have to   beopme  substantially a Government measure.        *             The Bill has received the  aotive support of the Labour   Party in  the past.   Its primary concern  is not to give  local   authorities a power to provide  boots suoh as  is already  possessed   by education authorities in  Scotland, but rather  to give some   temporary assistance to certain specially distressed  areas.   In   1928  the  needs  of these areas were  alleviated by  the  Lord Mayor.V*   Fund.  This  is no longer available.  On the other hand the   Local Government  Aot,  1929,  has now appreciably relieved the
                                                                  9i r? atrain on the rates  in these  areas,  and in so  far as  the provision. of footwear  is  required to relieve destitution,  suoh  provision is within the power  and indeed  is the  duty of  the public assistance authorities.          OJhe Bill wai) probably be regarded as of little value unless  the resulting expenditure falls largely on the Exchequer; tut there is no precedent  for the Exchequer bearing 90  per  cent., or indeed any large  proportion,  of expenditure the amount of whioh is at the absolute discretion of  local  authorities. further, from the point of  view of the Ministry  of Health,  there would foe embarrassment  in making any special grants in  aid  of  a particular Health Service  over  and above the general  grant  payable under the local Government  Act.          JProm the point of view of  education, it would be  difficult to aid  this particular  expenditure at  a higher rate than the 50 per  oent. given for  the  provision of meals  and other similar activities.          Even in the most  favourable  circumstances the Bill oould not heoome operative in time  to meet any special distress during the coming winter.   If at any time the Government should  consider it desirable to make some  special grant-in-aid to exoeptioal  areas, other prompter and more convenient methods of  distribution  oould probably be devised.          In sll t-he circumstances we  suggest  that- any  required statement of the Governments attitude towards the Bill should  be to the effeot that  the Government view the  object of the.  Bill with great  sympathy, but that  they cannot undertake to take aotion at present,  or agree  to the proposed Exchequer grant of  90 per cent.    The conditions of  Government  business do not  offer any hope  that  the  Government  could  give  time for &quot;the passage of  the moo sure.                                   &apos;Intia.)
