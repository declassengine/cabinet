case for the creation of additional machinery0  Mr grahamhad gone to Manchester with LIr Clynes on the cottonposition0  He had a?l^-ed for a report on the position in all industries and would prefer to examine the whole question very closely himself in the first instance0  He had spent the week-end in examining the report and asked that no new machinery should he set up without further consultations      We then discussed in private the whole industrial position.  It was unanimously agreed that the First Lordof the Admiralty should proceed at once with whatever steps are possible to push forward senernes for the immediate re-organisation of railway sidings 9 colliery screens and coalwagons etco5 and to that end immediately to interview theMinister of Transport with regard to the schemeunderstood to have been submitted by the Railway Companies^      There way general agreement that every effort mustbe made to extend as rapidly as possible our export market s*and as a first step we met the Secretary of the Departmentof Overseas Trades and discussed what has been and is being-done to stimulat^ export trade,.
