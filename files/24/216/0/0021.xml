THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1930.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON BUDGETARY  AND  HORSE-POWER LIMITATION.                             Summarised Report.    1.   IN submitting a report to the Cabinet on the practical application of theprinciples of  budgetary and  horse-power limitation, we  have had  in  mind thenumber of important points raised which should be available for the United kingdom delegates when  discussion on the Draft  Disarmament Convention takes place atGeneva.  We  have, therefore,  entered, into considerably  more detail than would otherwise have been necessary : consequently, we  attach herewith in the  form of asummary, a note of the recommendations we have submitted for the consideration ofthe Cabinet: -(a)  Budgetary Limitation.    The Committee have to report, as regards the practical application of budgetary limitation to the three fighting services in  such a manner as will safeguard national interests     (a) that from the Treasury aspect no difficulties  are anticipated which should          not be capable of reasonable adjustment at Geneva;    (&amp;) that  from  the  Admiralty point  of  view there is no objection, but our          acceptance of this principle  for the Navy should be made  subject to the          attitude of the other naval powers and to the conditions of Article 21 of          the London Naval Treaty if France and Italy have been unable to compose          their differences;    (c) that from the War Office aspect the application of this principle is not only           feasible  but essential:    (d) that the Air Ministry, having found themselves unable to recommend that           this principle can be applied without detriment to national security, the          matter must be referred back to the Cabinet for final decision.(b)  Horse-Power Limitation for Aircraft.    The Committee,  having  regard to  the  various  factors  connected  writh theapplication of this principle, recommend     (a) that,  as the  practical application  of horse-power limitation to aircraft           appears to present grave technical difficulties; and as the only methods           of  measuring horse-power at present devised can be easily evaded or will           require a measure of international supervision, it is generally undesirable,           from a national security point  of view, to accept this form of limitation;    (&amp;) that,  in view of the fact that some embarrassment might be caused to the           United Kingdom Delegates to  the Preparatory Commission if they were           instructed to reopen this question,  it will be more  suitable if the initial           move is left to the  Canadian Delegate, who can,  in due course, receive           support from the United Kingdom Delegation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,      November 3, 1930.[21947]

Composition and Terms of Reference.    1.  The Cabinet at their Meeting held on the 15th October, 1930, directed that,*as recommended by the Committee of Imperial  Defence, a Committee composed of         The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Chairman),        The Secretary of State for  War,        The Secretary of State for Air,        The First Lord of the Admiralty,        A representative of the Treasury,with power to co-opt such experts  as they may  think fit, should meet, with thefollowing terms of reference :     (a) To examine and report to the Cabinet  regarding the practical details of the          application  of the principle  of   Budgetary Limitation to the three          Fighting Services in such manner as will safeguard national interests.    (b) To recommend to the Cabinet the best  method of dealing with the Air          Ministry&apos;s difficulties regarding limitation by horse-power.    2.  A Committee was set up accordingly,consisting of the following Members:         The Right Hon. Arthur Henderson, M.P. (Chairman).        The Right Hon. Tom Shaw, C.B.E., M.P.        The Right Hon.

The Committee has held two Meetings, on the 21st and 31st October, 1930.    PART T. The Application of the Principle of Budgetary Limitation to the                           Three Fighting Services.(a)  General Observations.    4.  Although we understand that it is not proposed to do more than outline theprinciples of budgetary limitation for  the fighting  services at Geneva during theforthcoming session  of the Preparatory  Commission, we  found it necessary toconsider the application of this principle in some detail, in order to appreciate itspracticability.                           * Cabinet 60 (30), Conclusion .11.                     -   ,
                                      c4&apos;    5;  We have dealt somewhat extensively with the observations of the various departments concerned, in order that this report, if accepted, may form a guide toour delegation at Geneva, and we have included suggestions as to how their pointsmay be met;  for ease of reference  we have summarised these observations inparagraph 13.   We examined  carefully the Model Statement  drawn  up by theCommittee  of  Experts  on  Budgetary  Questions set up  by   the  PreparatoryCommission in 1927, in order to see whether  this form was  suitable or whether any modifications  would be necessary if it should be adopted.   A copy of this modelform is attached as  Appendix I, together with the observations of the Departmentsconcerned. (b)  Treasury Observations.     6.  The Treasury furnished us with a Memorandum on the practical application -of budgetary limitation, and we would draw especial attention to certain points of importance :       (i) It is considered preferable to  limit specific selections of  Budget  items            designed to represent war-like expenditure and  expenditure on wrar            material.  This accords  with the recommendations of the Committee of            Imperial  Defence (C.I.D.  Paper  No.  10&apos;16-B.  Appendix  III,  para-            graph 3).     (ii). As regards the selection of items,  it is  thought best to apply the limits to\ ,    &apos;       total expenditure and to expenditure on war material as defined in the            Model Statement and   instructions  of  the  Committee of  Budgetary            Experts (see paragraph 5 ante and Appendix I).  If this method is to be           . effective, however, two conditions are  necessary :             (a) As a preliminary to an agreement on limits, each State will have to                  fill in the Model Statement as well as it can with current figures,                  explaining where it has to depart from the instructions and under-                  taking to fill in its future returns on the same basis.            (b) It is most  desirable that each return should be accompanied by  a                  detailed reconciliation of its figures with Budget figures.*  This                  will give some guarantee that  the figures are not manipulated and                  that  they have equal authority with  audited Budget figures, t                       (Note, At the 138th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial                  Defence it was recommended &quot; that the information as to scales of                  armaments and  programmes  of  construction to  be given to the                  League of Nations should be  the  same as is given to  Parliament                  (viz., estimates and returns laid on the Table), and that, so long as                  some of the principal naval and military powers remain  outside                  the League of Nations, the difficulties of giving more information                  than this are manifest.&quot;  This recommendation was confirmed at                  the 222nd Meeting  of the  Committee  of  Imperial  Defence,                  Minute   1  (A),   and   accepted  by  the  late  Cabinet,  vide                  Cabinet 15 (27),  Conclusion 3,)            (c) The  question  of credits carried over from  year to year must be                  &apos; considered from  two points of view :   (i) that of the return of                   actual expenditure during a past year;  and (ii)  that  of the over-                   riding figure of Budgetary Limitation.   As  regards  (i),  no                   difficulties are anticipated, since the  Convention requires one                   return of actual  expenditure  at the end of each  year, which it  is   ;&apos;               proposed should  include all expenditure actually incurred in the                   year.in question; it is also suggested  that this  return include a        .&apos;;         &apos; statement&apos;of unexpifed  credits outstanding at.the close  of each                   year.     &quot; I.e., the Appropriation Account of actual Budget expenditure, not the Budget estimate.     t The Treasury have, informed the Committee, that the figures to be inserted in the model statement and those included in the reconciliation statement would be in general form, and not contain explicit details &apos; regarding the expenditure in the vote concerned.
                     For the purpose of building up (ii) the criterion should be the                 maximum amount of  expenditure estimated to occur during, any                 one financial year covered by the agreement. So far as the United                 Kingdom are concerned, this will cause no difficulty, but countries                 using the &quot; block credit &quot; system may find it more difficult, and it                 will be necessary for us to ensure that the figures submitted by such                 countries are not inflated by the inclusion of block credits.             (d)  The final question is whether a State, if her defence expenditure is                 retarded by emergency in any year, should have the right to catch                 up in subsequent  years.  It is suggested that, in practice, any                 such provision is unnecessary, as sufficient margin should exist in                 the estimates submitted.  While it would be possible, in theory, to                 allow- a given fraction of  any underspending in one year to  be                 carried over to the next year, it is pointed out that this might allow                 any State  a loop-hole for a  concealed increase  of  the  margin                 permitted,  and is, therefore, not recommended.^(c)  Admiralty Observations.     7.  The Admiralty, in examining the application of the principle of budgetary limitation, have drawn attention to the following general points; and,  in outliningthem, we have suggested how they may be or are being met:      (a) It is essential  to get agreement with  the Dominions as to how the naval           budgets are to be  shown in the Model Statement; it has been suggested*           that the figures for naval expenditure of each Member of the British           Commonwealth should be given separately, but they would be grouped           together in  a single block.  At the  end of the group, the aggregative           figures should be  shown, if  necessary, in italics, and a footnote  to this           total added, stating that &quot; virement &quot;  is allowed by arrangement between           the  various  parts of  the British Commonwealth within this declared           total.               Note by Committee.                    This proposal has been put before  the Dominions, who will               inform the United Kingdom, in due course, of their recommendations               (7th Meeting, Imperial Conference Committee  on  Arbitration and               Disarmament).     (b) It is essential that the budgets of the several countries are both homogeneous           and comprehensive;  that the same things are limited for each  country           and that no loop-holes are left for unlimited expenditure properly  coming           within  the  sphere of  armaments.    It  is  suggested that  non-warlike           expenditure and funds allotted  to non-effectives should be omitted; while           care should be taken to see that no commitments on the part of Govern-           rnents which tend to relieve their  service estimates should escape the           principle of limitation. e.g., guarantees to national firms to enable them           to compete successfully for foreign warship orders.               Note by Committee.                    Paragraph  6  (i) of the Treasury Notes lays down that only               &quot;Warlike &quot; expenditure is intended to be limited; the other points               must be borne in mind and dealt with when details are discussed.     (c) It is very difficult to foresee the future requirements of the Navy, particularly           at present,  when no definite programme of ship construction is being           drawn up and adhered to; with a tendency to  defer.programmes,  arrears           are liable to pile up, making it difficult to estimate,.in advance, expendi-           ture of the highest peak year.  The possibility of an increased personnel           vote for  the purpose of improving.the standard  of living or raising pay           must also be borne in mind.               Note by Committee.                          -                    This difficulty is realised;  it will be  necessary, we think, to               examine  carefully,  possibly by  a  Committee,  the figures  to  be                              * E. (30) 27, paragraph 14.
              submitted by the three service departments between now and the date              for the Disarmament Conference.   In regard to the personnel vote,              any such increase can probably be met from the margin allowed, but              the whole matter will have to be exhaustively examined before any              definite recommendations can be formulated.  The solution of these              two  problems should not,  we  feel, in  practice, prove  particularly              difficult.    (d) Continued reductions in  expenditure  in  recent, years have affected Naval          strengths,  including  war reserves of  material; the  existing  rate  of          expenditure is, in consequence, abnormally low for the strength of  the          fleet at the present time.  This point also  will need careful consideration          in fixing the margin above our present Navy estimates.  For example,          Australia might very  well  demand a  margin of 40 per cent, over  her          present expenditure.              Note by Committee.                   The  same remarks will  apply  here  as under (c)  above;  the              situation  must be most carefully examined before the time for the              filling in  of the model  statement arrives.    (e) Unless France and Italy have adhered to Part III of  the London Naval          Treaty, it may be  impossible, in practice,  for the principle of budgetary          limitation  to  be applied  to our naval  expenditure.  Article 21 of the          Draft Convention provides a &quot;let out&quot;  clause, and  it is assumed that          this will apply to expenditure as well as armaments; if necessary, this         - should be made clear.              Note by Committee.                   This point is also fully appreciated,  and will  be  taker,  up at              Geneva;  it should not  present much  difficulty.    (/) The suggestion that power of virement  be permitted  between the three          services is not favoured.              Note by Committee.                   This accords with the views of the Treasury and the War Office;:              power of  virement would certainly open up  a number of channels for              evasion, and  does not seem to accord  with the  principles of the              Convention.    (g) If the principle of budgetary limitation for  naval  forces is not accepted by          the other naval Powers, then our  position will  have to be reconsidered;          for example, we could hardly agree to limit ourselves in this way if the          United States and Japan stood out.              Note by Committee.                   This is a contingency which will have to be considered if and              when  it arises.    8&apos;.  In  regard to the  actual form  of  the  model statement, the Admiraltyobservations are included in Appendix A.(d) War Office Observations.    9.  The War Office,  having always supported the principle, of budgetary linrita-tion for land forces and material, have accepted the Model Statement  except that,for  administrative  reasons,  it  is  impossible  to  separate &quot;Metropolitan&quot;  and&quot; Colonial &quot; Expenditure, and have only added a strong recommendation that powerof virement between the services should not be permitted.(e) A ir Ministry Observations.     10.  The  application of this principle to the Air Force has been almost one ofour main preoccupations.  We realise that the Air Force,  like the Navy and unlike the Army,  will be submitted to material limitation: but we understand, also,  that
this method cannot be so effective for the Air Force as for the Navy, for obvious reasons, such as the impossibility of limiting spare parts which by assembling can, at short notice, be converted into complete machines.     11.  As regards  the  actual  difficulties  of practical  application,  we  have explained briefly what they are and how they may be met, so that some assessmentmay be possible as to the side on which the balance lies.     (a) The cost of. construction in the United Kingdom is considerably higher than           in continental countries; a result compounded of the factors of better           workmanship, higher  factors of safety and higher wages.  For example,           the 680 first line  aircraft of this  country cost  roughly  half a million           sterling more than the 1,350 first line aircraft possessed by France.  And           as a corollary of this the cost of maintenance of our Air Force is higher,           being recruited on a voluntary basis,  than for a continental Air Force           based on the conscription system.   The net result being liable to expose           us to unfair criticism and the drawing of uncomparable comparisons.               Note by Committee.                   The answers  to  these points may be summarised shortly by               saying that budgetary  limitation is not intended as a basis of iriter-               national comparison but  only  of  national comparison -. that is,  to               compare, over successive years, the expenditure oi each country on its*               fighting services  with  the object  of  observing that  it  is  fulfilling               faithfully its  undertakings.  Each  country  must  also, under the               system proposed, be the final judge  of the  figures it submits and,               although it may have to endure criticism,  no formal power can force               it to abandon or reduce  expenditure which  is considered  vital  to               preserve national security.    (b) Since no country can be forced to accept any figures to which it does not           agree there will be a tendency  to submit estimates of fictitious size which           will thus negative any advantage that  budgetary limitation may possess.               Note by Committee.                   Such a contingency  is,  of course, possible : at  the same time               there will exist two checks  to such  a procedure, one  of an inter-               national and the other  of a national character.  Internationally, any               country submitting obviously excessive figures would certainly have               to   face  public criticism with  all  its  damaging  reactions  and               nationally,  would  be  confronted with  its own taxpayers.  Any               Government employing such tactics might run the risk, therefore,               of incurring both public and private odium.    (c) Any attempt to restrict expenditure  on military aviation would merely be a           direct incentive to divert the money to civil aviation which would at once           destroy any balance that might have been achieved.  Such  an effect would           react most unfavourably  on  this country which, for various obvious           reasons, is  a small-holder in civil aviation as  the following expenditure           figures for  the year 1928-29 will  show :                    United  Kingdom    ...       ...       ...     400,000                   France     ...       ...        ...       ...    1,750,000                   Germany   ...       ...       ...       ...    2,500,000                   United  States       ...       ...       ...    3,100,000           The true measure of the potential air strength  of a country is to be found           in its civil  industries, of which civil aviation  forms an important part:           therefore, to adopt any scheme likely  to transpose the roles of  military           and civil aviation will  be  to  place this country  in a position  of  even           greater  air inferiority than she  occupies universally to-day and  will,           moreover,  make  that  inferiority  not  only permanent but on an ever-           increasing  scale,  as  the   Continental nations  enlarge  their  natural           facilities.   It must be realised that civil aircraft although adaptable for           offence are  useless  for defence which can only be provided  by military
aircraft:  the effect of budgetary limitation will be to hamper our defencewhile  encouraging  the  offensive  power  of  other  nations.    the vulnerability of this country to air attack is of sufficient gravity without,the addition of further and more uncertain risks.     Note by  Committee.         It is freely admitted that there is  a  danger that the adoption     of budgetary limitation for Air Forces may enforce an expansion of     civil aviation and that, should such a contingency arise, the reactions     on this country might be unfavourable.  It is  pointed out, however,     that  only  a  proportion of  civil  aircraft  could be  converted to     military purposes, and,  also, that  budgetary  limitation will place     a limit on the amounts spent by the Governments in keeping up their     aircraft  factories and  Establishments.   The Convention also makes     provision for publicity regarding  civil  aircraft,  so that it will be     possible  to keep an eye on  (developments.   If all air forces  are     subjected to  budgetary limitation on the military side and publicity     on the civil side, it is not seen how this country can be any worse     off than  she is now.  An increase of civil aviation really intended     for increased military air strength would be subject to review by the     proposed Disarmament Commission  and,  if necessary, to action by     the Council.    (d) It is essential that the Air Force is kept up to date as regards material;           that is to say, that every  advantage can  be taken of improved  safety           equipment  and that aircraft may be  kept defensively  up to date.  If           budgetary limitation is applied, it may mean that money is not available           for this legitimate purpose  without decreasing the size of the force below           that required for national security, or, alternatively, that  the Air Force           must be allowed to get out of date, and thus lose efficiency as a service-           which would again be detrimental to national security.               Note by Committee.                   The amount of money available for improvements must depend,.               naturally, on the funds  available,  and it will be a matter for His               Majesty&apos;s Government to  decide on the margin  to be allowed for               such purposes.  The idea of budgetary limitation is to put a check               to the  unrestricted development of  more destructive and costly air               weapons and not to legitimate development.   There can be no doubt               that every  country will  demand   a  reasonable margin for con-               contingencies, and that no  objections  can be. raised to this procedure.    12.  The observations of the Air Ministry on the  Model Statement are includedin Appendix I.    13.  The following summary of the observations of the Departments concerned is included for reference purposes : Summary of Treasury Observations.    (a) Warlike expenditure and expenditure on war material only should be subjectto budgetary limitation.    (&amp;) Limits should be applied to total expenditure and to expenditure on warlikematerial as defined in the Model Statement  (Appendix  A), on the conditions      (i) that each State, after filling in current  figures, will  explain  where any           departure from the instructions is necessitated and will undertake to fill           in future returns on the same basis;    (ii) that each return be accompanied by a detailed reconciliation of its figures.           with Budget figures, i.e., the appropriation account of the actual Budget           expenditure.    /(c) The question of credits carried  forward must be considered from the pointof view.of the return of actual expenditure during a past year and that of the over-riding figure of Budgetary Limitation,  and, in regard  to the latter,  the returns of countries employing the  block credit&quot; system will need careful scrutiny.
i OOX tc o .  .      It is not necessary  or  desirable to make any provision  for carrying over defence  expenditure,  which has  been retarded by  emergency,  from  one year to another. Summary of Admiralty Observations.    &apos; (a)  It is essential to get early agreement with the Dominions regarding the method of showing naval budgets in the Model Statement.     (b)  It is essential that  the budgets of  the various countries are homogeneous and.comprehensive,  that the same things are limited for each country, and that no loopholes are left for evasion.  Only &quot; warlike &quot; expenditure should be shown in the Model Statement.     (c) It will be very difficult, under present conditions of uncertainty, to forecast the expenditure required for the navy in the highest peak year;  the possibility of having to increase the personnel vote due  to improving the standard  of  living or augmenting pay must not be overlooked. ! .  ..(d)  The existing  rate of expenditure is abnormally  low to the strength  of the fleet, particularly expenditure on  war reserves of  material;  this point will need careful consideration in fixing the margin.     (e) Unless France and Italy have adhered to Part III of  the London  Naval Treaty it may be impossible to apply budgetary limitation to our navy.  &apos;&apos;.&apos;(/) No power of virement  should  be permitted between the three services.     Iff)  If the principle of budgetary limitation for naval forces is not accepted by other naval Powers our position will need reconsideration.   &quot;&apos; \h)  The Model Statement is accepted. Summary of War Office Observations.   -; (d) No  power  of virement  should  be  permitted between the  three  fightingservices.    (&amp;) The Model Statement is, in principle, acceptable.Summary of Air Ministry Observations.    (a) The cost of  construction and maintenance in this country is approximatelydouble that of Continental Countries,  due to better workmanship, higher factors of safety, higher  wages, and the employment of the voluntary system of recruiting. This makes our position very difficult and might lead to unfair comparisons.   i (b) Since each country is the sole  arbiter of the figures it submits, estimates arelikely to  be fictitiously high, thus negativing any advantage of budgetary limitation.    .(c) To restrict expenditure on military aviation  will serve merely to divert itto, civil aviation, which will place this  country at a still greater disadvantage, owingto; the lack  of natural openings for the development of civil aviation in a smallcountry possessing excellent ground transport facilities.    .,(d)  Budgetary limitation may  impose undue restrictions on legitimate technical development;  that is, improvements in safety or defensive devices.Conclusions. :.-3..p&apos;V.    14.  We have examined the question of the application of Budgetary limitation to each of the three fighting services in some detail.    15.  As regards the Admiralty, it has been found that the practical applicationof this principle should not  present any insuperable difficulties, though, in view ofthe restrictions already imposed by  the Washington and London Naval Treaties, it is necessary chiefly to prevent  the construction of highly costly scientific engines of destruction, such as the pocket battleship.  There are certain points of importance inconnection with the application of this principle to the Navy which we have alreadybutlihed, but we consider that these can most suitably be dealt with as and when they arise&apos;at Geneva.    16.  Prom the point of view of the War Office, it appears that, not only is the principle of budgetary limitation  strongly  advocated, but that,  since it  has been found  impossible to  evolve  a  practical  method  of limiting  Avar material by enumeration, this represents the sole method of preventing the development of highly destructive military forces.
                                       IP     17.   We have unfortunately not been able to arrive at a definite conclusion asregards  the  application of this principle,to  the  Air Force.   It is the considered opinion of the Air Ministry, after careful examination, that this form of limitationin conjunction with those already proposed, will, in practice, produce a  situationinimical with our national security.  The reasons for this conclusion are fully setout in paragraphs 10 and  11, as are also our observations thereon.   The Cabinethowever, having decided in favour of the adoption of this principle for all three fighting services, we feel that we can only report back the Air Ministry&apos;s represen-tations which affect a matter of high policy which only the Cabinet can decide.     18.   The Treasury have shown that there should be no serious difficulties in theapplication of this principle, but we  consider that the matters to which they draw attention in paragraph 6 should be taken into account at Geneva.Recommendations.     19.   The Committee have to report, as  regards the practical application of budgetary limitation to the three fighting services  in such a manner as will safeguardnational interests  :      (a) that,  from the Treasury aspect, no difficulties are anticipated which should           not be capable of reasonable adjustment at Geneva;     (b) that,  from the Admiralty  aspect, there is no objection, but our acceptance           of this principle for the Navy should  be made subject to the attitude of           the other naval powers and to the conditions of Article 21 of the London           Naval  Treaty if France  and  Italy have  been  unable to  compose their           differences;     (c) that, from the War Office aspect, the application of this principle is not only           feasible but essential;     (d) that  the Air Ministry, having found  themselves unable to recommend that           this principle can be applied without detriment to national security, the           matter is referred back to the Cabinet for final decision.                 PART  II. Horse-Power Limitation for Aircraft.Position at the Preparatory Commission.    20.  When the First Reading of the Draft Convention was held at Geneva in1927, Viscount Cecil stated  in the debate that &quot; the British Government, in accepting this proposition &quot; (i.e., the  proposal to limit aircraft by horse-power), &apos;: at the FirstReading, reserve to themselves all question of trial and all questions which deal withverification, their opinion being that  it is impossible to control the horse-power of aeroplanes except by accepting (and this  is a very important point)  the  statements of countries to which they  belong. &quot;*   In the  text of the Second Reading, however,for some reason, this specific  reservation was not printed  alongside Article AA.tThe text which  emerged from  the Second Reading contained no  reservations orobservations at all, as a special footnote shows.f.    21.  The position, therefore, is not quite clear, but it is realised that the UnitedKingdom delegation may be placed in some difficulty if required directly to reopenthis point.Difficulties of Applying Horse-Power Limitation.    22.  The difficulties of applying and  accepting Horse-Power limitation for thiscountry are twofold and will be examined under two headings :             ;(a) General.     (i). Civil  aircraft will  be unaffected  by this proposal and since their numbers and weight-carrying capacity are steadily increasing, their capacity for aggressivepurposes (but not, of course, for defence)&apos;will increase proportionately.   This pointassumes increasing significance if military aircraft are restricted, as regards their defence ability, by numbers and handicapped by horse-power limitation.    f, Minutes of the Third Session of the Preparatory Commission, C. 810, M. 109, 1927, ix, page 140.    t  Ibid., page 456.    X  Minutes &quot;of the Sixth Session of the Preparatory Commission, page 222.
     (ii)  Horse-power limitation considered in relation to military aircraft only will produce  effects which will be partly governed by geographical considerations.  The proximity of London to the frontier, for example, places us at a relatively greater disadvantage than France : a disadvantage, moreover, which will be emphasised by the introduction of horse-power limitation because we shall be compelled to allot  a higher proportion of aircraft  for  purely  local defence than will France with her capital much farther from the frontier. (b) Technical.     There are two methods of assessing horse-power :      (i) By  means of practical test bench trials in order to ascertain the  &apos;&apos; brake          horse-power,&quot; i.e., the actual power  output.     (ii) By  the &quot; cubic capacity &quot; method, i.e., a method very similar to that used for          estimating the horse-power of motor-car engines  for taxation purposes.     23.  The first method is the only really reliable and accurate record of the actualpower  output and could be made definitely effective in connection  with  limitation.In order  that such a method could be put into practice, however, it is obvious that asystem of rigorous international inspection would be necessary which at  once raisesthe difficulty that no country will  be prepared to  tolerate &apos;&apos; commissions &apos;&apos;  of thiskind.     24.  The second method, though, more practical from an international point ofview, possesses  the grave disadvantage of being highly misleading for purposes of comparison.   The figures produced would be purely  arbitrary and would have nofixed relation to the actual power output of the  engine and variations up to  100 percent, would  be of common occurrence.   Further, opportunities for technical  evasionwould be many : for example the fitting of superchargers.   And  this method couldonly be applied to petrol engines of orthodox design :  a petrol-driven turbine for usein aircraft would be outside this restriction.     25.  Of the two possible practical methods of limiting horse-power, therefore,the only  one likely to be  really effective will be impossible without international supervision on the spot, and the one that is most practicable  internationally  appearsto be open to evasion with the greatest  ease, and is, in any case, no real  measure ofthe horse-power developed; for example, a car  with a horse-power tax  of  10 will develop, probably,  20-30-h.p. on the road.Summary.    26.  The  position  regarding  horse-power limitation may be summarised as .follows :      (a) It would appear to be undesirable that the  United Kingdom  Delegation          should  re-open  this question at Geneva since the reservations made on&apos;&apos;          behalf  of His  Majesty&apos;s   Government at  the  1927  Session  of the          Preparatory Commission were not repeated at the 1929 Session.     (&amp;) This limitation cannot be applied  to  Civil Aircraft,  and would tend,          therefore,  to force  countries  to develop   civil  aviation on  potentially          military lines, which must  place  us  at a grave disadvantage  in  view of          our geographical situation.     (c) The most effective method of measuring horse-power for limitation purposes          cannot  be used without a system of international inspection, while the          most practicable method is capable of the  most easy evasion.Conclusions.    27.  From  the general point of view of desiring to further the limitation ofarmaments by all possible means, the adoption of a system of horse-power limitationis obviously  desirable.   At,the  same time,  we do not wish to blind  ourselves to thepractical  side of  those  issues and  subscribe to any measures which  are either socapable of easy evasion as to be worthless, even dangerous, or  are likely to serve as an incentive  to the dishonest  development of  what  should be purely  peaceful  and commercial activities.
    28.  We are definitely in favour, in principle, of the application of horse-powerlimitation, but we have been forced to the conclusion that, in practice, the difficultiesof application are such as will create an entirely artificial situation, which cannot but react  most  unfavourably on this country  without  even the  compensatingadvantage  of being a definite  contribution to world peace and disarmament.    29.  We  understand  that the Canadian  representative  at  the  PreparatoryCommission intends to oppose this principle;  Canada was not represented at thesecond reading of the Draft  Convention,  and is, therefore, free from the possibleembarrassment which might face our Delegation.  We think, in these circumstances.that it will be best to let the Canadian representative launch the attack, which canthen be supported by us without the publicity attaching to a prime mover.Recommendations.    30.  The Committee, having regard  to  the  various  factors outlined above,recommend :     (a) that,  as  the practical application of  horse-power limitation  to aircraft           appears to present grave technical difficulties;  and as the only methods of           measuring horse-power at  present devised can be  easily evaded or will           require a measure of international supervision, it is generally undesirable,           from a national security point of view, to accept this form of limitation.    (b) that, in view of the fact  that some embarrassment  might be caused to the           United Kingdom delegates to the Preparatory Commission if they were           instructed to reopen this question, it will be more  suitable if the initial           move  is left to the Canadian Delegate, who can, in due course, receive           support from the United Kingdom Delegation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,      November 3, 1930.
APPENDIX  A.                               Model Statement.    The detailed suggestions of the three fighting services on the model statementare as follows : 1.  Admiralty.    (a)  The form of the model statement is accepted.    (6)  It is understood that, under Article 12 of the Draft Convention, there willbe one figure for Naval forces, indicating, without detail, the limit of total expendi-ture on  all services included under the several heads covered by the limitation, and,also, there will be one figure for war material for the purpose of Article 13.  It isfurther  understood that, whatever connotation is given to the words &quot; Metropolitan &quot;and &quot; Colonial &quot; at the top of the form, one column only will be shown for the naval forces for the purposes of limitation as well as publicity.    (c)  Since the model statement is prepared on a gross basis, special steps will benecessary to ensure that there is no duplication, where, for example, a contribution to naval expenditure  is  made by a  Dominion who  has  also  accepted budgetary limitation.2.  War Office.    The form of the model statement is accepted.  For administrative reasons it willnot  be   possible to  separate  &quot;Metropolitan&quot;   from  &quot;Colonial&quot;   expenditure.Column 3 only can be used.3.  Air Ministry.    The comments of the Air Ministry on the model form are set out in detail* andfor the  sake of brevity it is not proposed to  recapitulate them.    It  is understood that, for purposes of Budgetary Limitation, the only figures given will be (a) the gross total of Heads 1 to 4 on the model form attached, and(b) the  figure for Head 4 within that total.    As   regards the  proposed  separation of &quot;Metropolitan&quot;  and  &quot;Colonial&quot;expenditure, it  has been  agreed that  the numerical  limitation  of  aircraft and personnel should be set out in one total irrespective of  whether the aircraft and personnel are at home or abroad.   The Air Ministry,  therefore, agree with theAdmiralty and  War Office and consider that no attempt should be made to showseparate figures for &quot; Metropolitan &quot;  and &quot; Colonial &quot; expenditure.B.H.P.L.
