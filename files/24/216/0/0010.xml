COPY HO,                           CAB I I E T,                     SEJDOHD__INTERIM  REPORT               THE PANEL OF MINISTERS ON UNEMPLOYMENT.,p. 360  (50)4f          Following on the acceptance by the Cabinet (Cabinet 62 (30)  Conclusion 6)  of our First Interim. Report (CP.354 (30))  a further meeting of&apos; the Panel of Ministers was  held  to consider whether it was desirable to initiate, in advance of a Report from the Royal Commission,  to be set up,  legislation to deal with  reported  abuses of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. There were present:-             The  Lord  Privy Seal (in the Chair).             The  Minister of Labour.             The  Secretary of State  for War.             The  First Lord of  the Admiralty.             The  Minister of Health.             The  Minister of Transport.             The  First. Commissijner  of &quot;works.             The  Chancellor of  the Duchy of Lancaster.           We had  before us additional information supplied by  the Minister of  Labour giving samples of  evidence of the existence  of  abuses of the  Schemo by short  time workers, seasonal  workers  and married  women.    In the light of this information we  considered  three  possible courses of action:-           (1)   Whether  it  was desirable or practicable                to fix  a limit of weekly earnings which                would,  if  reached or  passed,  operate to                exclude  the earner  from drawing  unemployment                benefit  in respeot  of the days  of the week                on which he was not working.          It was agreed  that it  would  be neither desirablenor practicable to adopt  this course.    It would  involvethe placing  on the worker  of the onus  of proving  that his weekly earnings were below whatever figure might be decided  on - the revival of  a principle which had little  to commend  itself --1-
and would present almost insuperable practical difficulties ofadministration.     We next considered          (2)  Whether it would be desirable or               practicable to confer on the Minister               of labour discretionary powers to order               a review of groups of workers and if               satisfied that abuses existed in these               groups to proceed to remedial measures               by way of Regulations.     Apart from constitutional objections to proceeding on these lines we felt that the exercise of discretionarypowers of this kind would place the Minister of Labour in amost insidious position.          (3)  Whether it would not be best to defer               taking any action to remedy alleged               abuses pending the Report of the Royal               Commission.     The opinion was unanimously held that this wasthe right course to adept.  The abuses thought to exist are so CICB ely bound together in the public mind that It wouldin practice be impossible to single out one or two for special treatment;  It would equally be impossible and indeed improperto attempt to deal at once with all the alleged abuses withoutthe fullest investigation and consultation with corkers and employers, an investigation which could only be satisfactorilyconducted by the proposed Royal Commission.     The Government will no doubt feel it -necessary to include in the Speech from the Throne a reference to legislation toincrease the borrowing powers of the Unemployment insurance fund and in the light of cur conclusion set out above wesuggest that a paragraph might be inserted an the following lines: -
         &quot;I propose immediately to set up a Commissionto enquire into the who 1 e question cf unemployment 1 oymentInsurance and in particular into the allegations ofabuse of its provisions which have teen made.   TheCommission will he asked to present interim reports on what it considers to he the most pressing questions.These interim reports will he immediately considered bythe Government and if necessary legislation will he introduced.   In the meantime it will he necessary tointroduce a financial measure to deal with the deficit on the Insuranee Fund,&quot;                                                       )          We have received and considered proposals fromthe Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade andfrom the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster making proposals for the expansion of our Export trade-   Theseproposals are to he further elaborated and we hope to bein a position to mate recommendations to the Cabinet                     (Signed)  TEENOK IIARTSE0H1T.2, Whitehall Gardens, S*Y/,1.     3rd October, 1930,
