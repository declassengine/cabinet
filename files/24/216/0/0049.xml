REPORT.                           ZoZShort, Historical Note regarding Article IB of the            Draft Disarmament Convention.              (Vide Telegram No. 148Q   1.    Article  IB,  in the  form proposed by the Netherlands        Government  (See Appendix II); -  and which has come up        again for discussion  at Geneva  -  was  embodied  in the        first  reading  text  of the  Draft  Disarmament Gonvention         (1927),    It was not  discussed  at the second reading        of the Convention  (1929).   2.    In preparing for the  third reading - now in progress -        a small  committee was  set  up at the Foreign Office which        put forward a  composite text, consisting partly af        the first and  second  texts and partly of de novo        suggestions.    This version was considered by the Sub-        Co:.Tmittee on the Reduction and limitation of Armaments,        and in an amended form  was recommended and accepted        generally by the Cabinet^  as the basis of His -Majesty&apos;s        Governments instruct ions t o their representative at the        Preparatcry Commission  which met on November 6th, 1930.   3.    The Foreign Office Committee substituted, in their draft, an        alternative text for Article IB as proposed by the        Netherlands Government  (See Appendix III):    this text,        after some discussion,  was deleted by the Sub-Committee        on Reduction and Limitation of Armaments on the general        grounds that it was impracticable to impose any method        cf direct limitation cf land war material,  and, therefore,        recourse must be had to indirect limitation by means of        Budgetary Limitation.     The Article,  if accepted and        put  forward by us,  might, it was felt, imply our agreement        with a form of limitation to which&apos;we were  opposed on        grounds cf impracticability.* Cabinet  66(30)  Conclusion 5..
9 0 9t.&apos; o JIt should also be noted that the proposals of theNetherlands Government appear in almost identic formin the Draft Convention with regard to the Supervision ofthe private manufacture and publicity of the manufactureof arms and ammunition and of implements of war.*Short Historical Note on the German Publicity Proposals (1923) .               (Vide Telegram No. 152).In 1920j the German Government put forward to the Leaguethe most comprehensive proposals for publicity regardingall classes of armaments including war industries etc.,based on the last paragraph of Article G of the Covenant,which reads as follows :--          &quot;The Members of the League undertake to          interchange full and frank information as          to the state of their armaments, their          military; navel and air programmes and the          condition of such of their industries as          are adaptable to war-like purposes.&quot;These proposals were considered by the late Governmentand it was finally decided that Tables I to IX, which dealt solely with &quot;effectives&quot;, could be accepted, if required;   also, details of military programmes, provided they were confined to information normally presented toParliament.   Articles X to XIV.. which required detailsof military  materials and industries capable of adaptionto war-like  purposes were rejected however, as requiringinformation which could not be given without detriment to national security.* C.I.D. taper No. 960-11, page 4 of Annexurs.5 Cabinet 41(28;, Conclusion 7.
 Recommendation. After considerable discussion it  was  recommended  that. ths views  of the three , Service Departments- should be&apos;&quot; set out for the  consideration of  the  Cabinet and  that Hr.  Dalton  would arrange for the views  of the  Secretary of  Stato for Foreign Affairs  to bo put before the Cabinet at  the- same time,    The Memoranda by  the throe  Sgrvice Departments is a otached to this Paper in the form..of an Annexuro,  and the  Conclusion  will  be  found on page 5.itehall Gardens, S.W.1 25th November, 1930.
ANNEXUKE.     MEMORANDA BY THE THREE SERVICE DHTPARTME^TS.I.        The Article under discussion proposes completepublicity of naval, military and air force war material.                                               landThe subject is analogous to the proposal to limit/warmaterial by enumeration which was considered and rejected.by Lord Cecil&apos;s Committee on the Reduction and Limitationof Armaments (C.I.D, Paper No. 1016-B).2.        The line of reasoning which led to the  objections,and to which we still subscribe,  may be summarised asfollows:-        (a) Practical.            The impossibility of a satisfactory definition            of war material.   In modern industrialised States            a great many commercial commodities can be            turned to warlike use.  For instance, it  would            be of little value to enumerate only  the            munitions actually in possession of a state&apos;s            army while omitting the  chemical substances            which the industries of that country  are            manufacturing and storing,  and which are            capable of quick conversion into explosives.            Similarly,  a list of tanks  would, be worth            little, because of the difficulty of  defining            what is and what is not a tank.   Again the            mobility of an army will, under modern conditions,            depend largely on the number of motor lorries which            can be impressed from civil sources on mobilisation:            and tho length of time an army can be maintained            in the field will depend on the productive capacity                                 -1-
  of the country&apos;s chemical and metallic industries.  Even if -rood faith on the part of all powers is  assured,  direct  enumeration of arms and munitions  will not  he  conclusive proof of relative warlike  power.    llany of these arguments apply with  equal  strength  to  air  force  material;  it  is a very simple  natter  to ;-.:eep a large force  of aircraft  in  small  sections which can be  assembled at  short notice, but which will not come within  the  scope  of the  return.(b) Military.    On tho  other hand,  enumeration of arras .and munitions    although not necessarily disclosing real strengths,    would certainly disclose real weaknesses.    Any    such details as shortage of reserves of any kind  -          mines,  depth  charges,   etc.  etc.    e.g.  of/shclls or machine guns/  would be  patently    obvious to possible opponents, and such knowledge    might quite easily lead to the deliver;/ of a    surprise attack before the enemy&apos;s deficiency could    be made -rood,   The tendency would, therefore, be  to    avoid even temporary deficiencies in equipment,    with the quite possible result of nations  increasing    their scale of preparedness.    This  point is  of especial importance at the present    time  when  all  three Services, for financial reasons,    have  been forced to allow their reserves to fall    to a  very low  standard.  So serious is the  position    in fact,  that  before any such publicity could be    made it would  be essential for national security    that  these deficiencies were made good which would    impose  a sudden heavy burden on the Exchequer.    It is for this reason that the representative of  the    Treasury has informed us that his Department are
                                                           f) n     not in favour of these publicity proposals. (c)  Again, this information, If correct, would -inevitably     disclose to a great extent the mobilisation and to     seme extent the tactical plans of the respective     States;  secrets which, hitherto, all naticho have     guarded  most Jealously.     The amount of material in reserve, for instance,     would indicate the number of reserve formations to     be  created on mobilisation;   the amount cf gun     ammunition in reserve  would  be a sure guide  as to the     length of time an army could maintain itself in the     field.     Prom a Naval point of  view,  disclosure of stocks of     mines, depth charges,  asdic  instruments,  etc.,  etc.,     will enable our plans  to be  deduced and so weaken our     defensive powers.     As  regards the  Air,  the  information might disclose  the     possible  capabilities  of a country to defend itself;     information,  which in  view of  the  groat vulnerability     of  this country  to air attack,  it  is obviously tin-     desirable  to publish.&apos;     From  publication of such     details it  weuld be  a  short  step to  questioning  the     country&apos;s  right  to hold  such reserves,  and to  suggestion     of  aggressive intentions  coupled with demands for     reduction.    Consequently there  is  every possibility     that the publicity suggested might  diminish  instead ef     increase  international goodwill.-(d) Political.    The consequences detailed above a re  inevitable even if   &quot;all  the contracting  States acted in  good faith.  unfortunate-    nately,&quot; good faith is by ns means certain..   Even   between the Allies in  the last war it was found frequently    impossible to secure frank interchange of information
U (j       indeed, at times, false information was actually       imparted on matters of vital interest.  How much more       difficult will the exchange of such information become       when some of the recipients are accounted as possible       opponents?  Inevitably the published facts as to arms       and munitions would be regarded with suspicion -       suspicion which would lead sooner or later to accusations       of bad faith,  Such accusations could only bo settled -       if settled at all - by an international tribunal with       powers of inspection and supervision, and it is not       easy to imagine any State at present submitting to such       inspection from without.3c        We fool that,  so long as armed forces exist,a certain amount of secrecy will be essential andinevitable.    Socrecy is only the expression of a                                        Isdetermination that,  if roccurso to arms i-/ necessary, theforces of the State shall be launched in the most favourable conditions for success that human ingenuitycan provide.  The origins of war do not lie either insecrecy or in Intelligence Staffs, the abolition of whichwill not bring the era of universal peace any nearer, thoughit might render future wars more bloody and indecisive.In democratic countries the secrets of national defenceare not numerous,  and in this country at any rate parliament is well/supplied with full information as to the scale ofour armaments.  The few and. important secrets which couldnot be concealed under the provisions of the NetherlandsDraft must be safeguarded in the vital interests ofnational security.                            -4-
9 Q ntJ U a0 OIIC LU SI PITS.4.          V/e have come therefore to the conclusion that theacceptance of publicity, as proposed in the Draft disarmament convention, is definitely undesirable for the following reaso   (a) That it would disclose the present grave deficiencies           in reserves of war material held by the three           Fighting Services, which disclosure can only be           regarded as inimicable with the interests of           National security, which Article 8 of the           Convention is intended to safeguard,,   Before any           such disclosures could be made it would bo           necessary that these deficiencies be made good,           which would impose a sudden and heavy burden on           the Exchequer;  the Treasury are in full agreement           with this aspect of the question, and therefore           associate themselves in opposing the scheme en           these grounds.                          . .  -   (b) That,  in view of the difficulties of defining- oertain           types of war material and the ease with which           other types of war material can either be           camouflaged or can be maintained in such a form           as will exclude them from the Returns, the door           is opened ts the compilation of deliberately           misleading returns.   (c) That the fact that the Returns required can be easily           evaded will undoubtedly create added suspicion,           and may in fact produce politically the exactly           opposite effect to that which is intendedo   (d) That the information required, If disclosed in full,           would undoubtedly give information of considerable           tactical if not strategical value to a potential           aggressor,  and by exposing the weakness of   a           Country, might act as a direct incentive to overt           action,   (e) That the substance of Lord Cecil&apos;s telegram No.152           is not in fact applicable to  the problem, because           the original recommendation on the German           publicity proposals was that  we could accept           publicity as regards effectives but not as  regards           material or the potential war industries of a           Country.(Signed)   FRED C,  DREYER.

This  question as  you know has been raised in another form inccrxaittce on manufacture  of  arms, but work of latter committee v/as suspended peliding outcome of deliberations of preparatory committee.      In the past  His Majesty&apos;s Government have  seen difficulty in agreeing to  furnish information as full as that demanded bythe Netherlands draft  and natter has not been lately reconsidered. It did not cone before Committee of Imperial Defence at its recentsessions of disarmament  convention.
