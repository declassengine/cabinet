SECEET.Copy No.    28CP. 47 (29).CABINET.THE REPOET OF THE HILTON YOUNG COMMISSION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN July 1927 the Cabinet decided that the time had come to take a preliminary step towards closer co-operation between the different Governments in Central and Eastern Africa. The White Paper (Cmd. 2904) on &quot; Future Policy in regard to Eastern Africa,&quot; after stating in general terms the case for closer union, ended with the following announcement of Government policy : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government consider, as a result of discussions between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Representatives of the territories in British Central and East Africa who attended the recent Colonial Conference, that some form of closer union between the territories of Central and Eastern Africa appears desirable, more particularly in regard to the development of transport and communications, customs tariffs and customs administration, scientific research and defence. They have therefore authorised the Secretary of State to send to Africa a special commission with the following terms of reference: 1. To make recommendations as to whether, either by federation, or some other form of closer union, more effective co-operation between the different Governments in Central and Eastern Africa may be secured, more particularly in regard to the development of transport and communications, customs tariffs and customs administration, scientific research and defence.2. To consider which territories could either now or at some future time be brought within any such closer union, and, in particular, how best to give effect to Article 10 of the Mandate for Tanganyika Territory, which provides that the mandatory may constitute the Territory into a customs, fiscal and administrative union or federation with the adjacent territories under its own sovereignty or control, provided always that the measures adopted to that end do not infringe the provisions of the Mandate.3. To make recommendations in regard to possible changes in the powers and composition of the various Legislative Councils of the several territories (a) as the result of the establishment of any Federal Council or other common authority; (b) so as to associate more closely in the responsibilities and trusteeship of Government the immigrant communities domiciled in the country; and (c) so as ultimately to secure more direct representation of native interests in accordance with (4) below.4. To suggest how the Dual Policy recommended by the Conference of East African Governors (i.e., the complementary development of native and non-native communities) can best be progressively applied in the political as well as the economic sphere.5. To make recommendations as to what improvements may be required in internal communications between the various territories so as to facilitate the working of federation or closer union..6. To report more particularly on the financial aspects of any proposals which they may make under any of the above headings.In making the declaration of policy involved in setting up a Commission with these terms of reference, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clear that they adhere to the underlying principles of the White Paper of 1923 entitled &quot;Indians in Kenya&quot; (Cmd. 1922), both in regard to the political[18886]
status and other rights of British Indians resident in East Africa, and also as regards the Imperial duty of safeguarding the interests and progress of the native population as trustees for their welfare until such time as they can take part more fully in their own Government and in the commdn affairs of all races inhabiting the territories. At the same time they wish to place on record their view that, while these responsibilities of trusteeship must for some considerable time rest mainly on the agents of the Imperial Government, they desire to associate more closely in this high and honourable task those who, as colonists or residents,&apos; have identified their interests with the prosperity of the country.&quot;The Commission, under the Chairmanship of Sir E. Hilton Young, proceeded to Africa in December 1927, returning in May 1928 to take further evidence and complete their labours on this side. Their Report (Cmd. 3234) was published simultaneously here and in East Africa on the 18th January. A great part of it is taken up by the enunciation of the general principles which ought to govern our policy towards the different elements which compose the population of Eastern Africa and for whose welfare the Imperial Government is responsible. Though not, in fact, involving more than the amplification and closer definition of what has already been implied in the White Papers previously issued by the Duke of Devonshire and myself, this part of the Report has been generally welcomed by public opinion in this country, especially by that section of it in all parties who attach importance to the fulfilment of our responsibility for the progress of the native inhabitants, as a masterly exposition of the guiding lines of policy on this all-important issue. Nor do I gather apart from one or two expressions of opinion, e.g., as regards the ideal of a common as against a communal franchise, and the ultimate impossibility of full responsible Government for the white population until the native population can take an equivalent share in the responsibility, in both cases in the nature of obiter dicta dealing with matters beyond the horizon of their actual recommendations (and, incidentally, dissented from by their Chairman) that the general principles of the Report have met with opposition in East Africa itself. If any changes in the machinery of Government in East Africa are to prove acceptable to Parliament, and, as I hope may be the case, largely non-controversial, it is, I think, essential that an early opportunity should be taken for an announcement that these principles are accepted and will guide the general policy of our administration in East Africa.In pursuance of their terms of reference, the Commissioners have also put forward a series of definite proposals, more particularly with reference to the closer union of the three northern territories, Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, with regard to which it will be necessary to come to certain provisional decisions. Their recommendations envisage three successive stages. As a first or preparatory stage they urge the immediate appointment of a High Commissioner to proceed to East Africa to inaugurate enquiries on questions of native policy, to promote unified control of services of common interest, and to discuss locally and work out arrange-ments for introducing the modifications proposed in the constitution of Kenya for the next stage. This High Commissioner is to have no administrative or legislative powers, but is to have &quot; wide executive&quot; powers, i.e., the powers exercised by the Secretary of State, to make the Governors do what he wishes. In the next or &quot; first stage of the definite plan&apos;&apos; a Governor-General is to be created to exercise, so far as they can be delegated to him, the functions of supervision and control now exercised by&apos; the Secretary of State, and to be endowed for this purpose with executive powers and with control over legislation to be exercised for certain defined purposes, more particularly the direction and supervision of native policy and the co-ordination of services of common interest. He is to work with advisory councils, one for general purposes, one for transport questions and one for customs, but to have no legislative or administrative powers. It is only in the next, or second definite stage, that the Governor-General is to become directly responsible, with the assistance of a small legislative council drawn from the councils of the three territories, for the legislative and administrative control of common services. In the meantime the first definite stage is to be accompanied by the substitution, for certain of the official members of the Kenya Legislative Council, of unofficial members nominated to represent native interests, thus creating an unofficial, but not an elected majority in the Council. As a safeguard against any possible risk of the misuse of the unofficial vote, the Governor-General is to be given special powers, in addition to the right of veto already exercised by the Governor, of enacting, over the head of the Council, any legislation which he regards as essential for the fulfilment of his responsibilities.
I have had the advantage during the last few weeks of discussing these proposals very fully not only with my advisers at the Colonial Office, but also with Sir Edward Grigg and Sir Donald Cameron, the Governors of Kenya and Tanganyika, and with Sir Claude Hollis, the Resident of Zanzibar and former Secretary for native affairs in Kenya and Chief Secretary of Tanganyika. As a result of these discussions I am convinced that, while the general object which the Commission have in mind is both desirable and possible, the actual methods they suggest are, whether from the constitutional or from the practical point of view, open to serious objections.The kind of &apos;&apos; executive &apos;&apos; power with which the proposed High Commissioner -and Governor-General are to be invested is a complete innovation in our constitu-tional system. In theory all executive power is vested in the Crown, which in a Colony is represented by the Governor. The Secretary of State&apos;s &quot;executive &quot; or rather controlling power, apart from certain statutory functions with regard to legislation, depends really upon his power to advise the King to recall a Governor who refuses to comply with instructions. The delegation of that power to an officer on the spot, who is not the King&apos;s representative, and has none of the definite responsibilities which rest upon the latter nor the expert advisers upon which the Governor or the Secretary of State can call for assistance, presents many difficulties. More particularly does it seem unnecessary to create such novel powers for the preliminary stage of local inquiry and consultation. On the other hand, I fully appreciate the view of the Commission that something more definite and authoritative-tive is required than the mere despatch of an envoy to investigate and negotiate. The solution of the difficulty, in the preliminary stage, which commends itself to all of us is that I should send out my Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Sir Samuel Wilson. As head of the Colonial Office, he would, without requiring to be invested with any special functions, be able to speak with an authority, with a knowledge of my views and with an influence over the subsequent carrying out of any conclusions arrived at and eventually approved, which no one could question. The convening of a Governors&apos; Conference, in order to go in detail into the administrative aspects of a scheme of closer union, and of less formal conferences with representatives of unofficial interests, in order to ascertain how far such a scheme could be made politically acceptable to East African public opinion, need not take very many weeks. If Sir S. Wilson goes out, as I propose, next month, he should be back, immediately after the General Election, in a position to submit to the Cabinet the result of his discussions.As regards the definite scheme itself the proposals of the Commissioners for the first stage appear to me to go, in some respects, too far and, in others, not far enough. The Commissioners, in their laudable anxiety to promote a greater unity in native administration, have, I think, somewhat overlooked both the inherent differences which make anything like uniformity in. administration impossible even in the same territory, let alone in territories at such different stages of development as those in question, and the extent to which native affairs touch every detail of the daily work of administration. The Governors whom I have consulted are clearly of the opinion that the carrying out of the principles of native policy laid down by the Commission is primarily the duty of the Governors themselves, subject to the general control of the Secretary of State, and that the unifying power of a High Commissioner or Governor-General in this sphere can be exercised sufficiently through his chairmanship -of the Governors&apos; Conference, and through the right to be furnished with copies of all despatches on important issues of policy, with the consequent opportunity of advising the Secretary of State, without investing him with arbitrary powers of executive or legislative interference. This, of course, does not apply to the case of Kenya, where any extension of political power, as recommended by the Commission, would naturally be accompanied by placing in the hand of the High Commissioner both negative and positive powers to safeguard the Imperial responsibility towards the native and Indian communities. Sir Edward Grigg has also suggested that in Kenya the High Commissioner might be made chairman of the Native Lands Trust Board, a proposal which would, I think, very effectively and completely meet such criticisms as have been directed in Parliament and in an appendix to the Commission^ Report against the present Kenya Land Trust Ordinance.On the other hand, as regards services of common interest, neither I nor the Governors whom I have consulted and on this point I have also had the advantage of the views of Sir R. Gowers, the Governor of Uganda are convinced that a more definite scheme of union, corresponding to the second stage of the Commission^ proposals, and involving the legislative and administrative unification of these -services under the High Commissioner, would not be as acceptable politically in East
[Africa from the outset as the vaguer executive control proposed by the Commission for their first stage. It certainly would be more efficient, and give the High Commissioner a much more definite field of responsibility and of continuous work.The general scheme then which commends itself to us as preferable to the first stage of the - Commission&apos;s scheme is one in which a High Commissioner or Governor-General should exercise complete and undivided control over certain common services defence, customs, transport, posts and telegraphs, wireless, aviation, central research, .&amp;c- these services being taken entirely out of the purview of the local governments and legislatures. In exercising these functions the High Commissioner would be assisted by a Federal Council on which, in addition to his own officials, there would be representatives from each of the Colonial legislatures, a method which would insure the retention of a substantial official majority, as well as by special advisory councils on railways and customs. His services, in so far as they were not already self-supporting, would be financed by an agreed percentage of the customs revenue, the balance being handed over to the local governments. Native affairs would remain essentially the domain of the local governments, but the High Commissioner, as chairman of the Governors&apos; Conference, could exercise a valuable co-ordinating influence over them, and, in the particular case of Kenya, would also be entrusted with special powers to balance any extension of unofficial representation on the legislature.It is on these genera! lines that I propose that Sir S. Wilson should approach the problem in his discussions in East Africa. But obviously he must have a free hand to consider modifications, whether in the direction of the Commission^ scheme or otherwise, subject always to the general consideration that they must not conflict with the broad principles of policy laid down by the Commission. In any case, any measure of agreement which he can arrive at locally must be provisional and subject to examination by the Cabinet. In this connexion I have already undertaken that no final action will be taken till we have had an opportunity of considering any points which the Government of India may put forward in connexion with the proposed change in the Kenya Constitution, and have already arranged that a repre-sentative of the Government of India should be attached to Sir E. Grigg&apos;s Executive Council for the purpose of the discussions with Sir S. Wilson. We are also pledged to discussion in Parliament, but if the programme I recommend is adopted, no need for that, will arise until after the election, when the Cabinet will have had time to consider Sir S. Wilson&apos;s report.Lord Lugard and Lord Olivier have both given notice that they wish to raise the question of the Governments policy on the Hilton Young Eeport on Wednesday, the 13th March, and Mr. Thomas, with whom I have informally discussed the situation, would like to ask me a question at an early date. I should, therefore, like to have the authority of the Cabinet for an announcement, in both Houses, that we accept the main principles of the Report, that I am sending out Sir S. Wilson to confer with the Governors and with representatives of unofficial opinion in East Africa to see on what lines consistently with those principles a scheme for the closer union of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika could best be carried out, but that no action which would finally commit the Government will be taken until he has returned and until there has been opportunity for full discussion in the next Parliament. An answer on these lines would, I think, be acceptable to Mr. Thomas, and the whole question would thus, as far at any rate as discussion in Parliament or in the political arena is concerned, stand over until after the election.L. S. A.Colonial Office, February 23, 1929.
