[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for tlie Cabinet.       January 1929.SECRET.CP. 1(29). -The Indian Contribution to Home Effective Charges of theBritish Army.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.At their meeting of the 21st November 1928 the Cabinet had before them the Report of a Cabinet Committee [Paper OP. 338 (28)] which, had been appointed on 6th June 1928, with the following Terms of Reference : &quot; To consider and advise &quot;(1) On the question of principle whether there should he a contribution by India, and if the decision is in the affirmative on the question of principle, how the claim of the Government of India that there should be no contribution by India should be dealt with.&quot;(2) Whether the existing contribution was equitable.&quot;(3) What powers could be exercised in the matter vis-a-vis the Government of India and the Secretary of State for India in Council.&quot;After discussion of the Report the Cabinet agreed : &quot; That the Secretary of State for India should send a private telegram to the Viceroy representing the strong opinion of the Cabinet that the Government of India ought to continue to pay a contribution, and should invite Lord Irwin&apos;s views as to the political repercussions of a decision to put pressure on the Government of: India in this direction. Lord PeePs telegram shordd suggest that the increased payments might be included in the five-year&apos;^ Contract Grant by which Army services in India are to be paid.&quot; The Secretary of State for India was asked to show the draft of his telegram to the Secretary of State for War before despatch.&quot;* Should be four.in accordance with this conclusion I telegraphed oa the 23rd November to the Viceroy, who was then touring in Burma and did not return to India till recently, and I now circulate copies of my telegram and of his reply.Lord Ir\vin&apos;s telegram speaks for itself, and I will only add the following remarks :-In his Memorandum to the Cabinet of 24th April 1928 the Secretary of State for War stated that the total charge of the War Office in respect of the training of British troops for India is now estimated at approximately  2,000,000 a year, as against the sum of  1,400,000 a year at present paid by India. Since the basis on which both figures are calculated is the same, and the increase is due solely to natural causes, it is sometimes suggested that the larger figure is a ;&apos; just debt &quot; which the Government of India are morally bound to pay because they are in fact already paying the lower figure, and that their refusal to pay it pending a decision on the question of principle is unconscionable. I should like to remove any such misapprehensions. The whole point is that the Government of India have never admitted the basis on which the smaller figure is calculated. The War Office have succeeded in establishing to the satisfaction of the Government of India the cost per annum of the recruiting, pay, clothing, food, instruction and other expenses of a recruit, and the number of recruits required annually for each arm of the service. But the calculation assumes that every soldier who goes to India receives training in England for 12 mouths, whereas the Government of India would prefer to receive recruits after 0 months&apos; training and complete their training in India. The calculation also assumes that the cost of training is * to be spread over the soldier&apos;s service with the Colours and that no credit is to be allowed to India in respect of service in the Reserve after return from India, whereas the Government of India have consistently held that, in accordance with the -practice in force up to the time of the Motley-IIaldane compromise in 1908, and with the recommendation of the Romer Committee of that date, as the Government of India and the India Office have always interpreted it, India is entitled to credit in respect 3372      75   1.29
of Reserve service as if it were service with the Colours. The Government of India accordingly maintain that the sum of  1,400,000 now paid is already too large by a considerable sum to cover the costs which can be justified on the basis of the decisions arrived at by the various Committees that have considered the Capitation Rate question in the past, and that until a decision has been given against India on these two important,points, quite apart from the political objections to which the Viceroy refers in his telegram, there are no grounds for making any provisional increase of the present payments pending a decision on their main claim. It is obvious, of course, that any increase of these payments must prejudice their general claim.PEEL.10th January 1929.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy,. 23rd Novemher 192S.&apos; 3345. Private and personal. My private and personal telegram dated loth November, No. 320 S. Capitation Rate question was discussed in Cabinet on Wednesday. I argued the Government of India&apos;s case at length. I laid stress on the political inadvisability, apart from legal difficulty, of any attempt by His Majesty&apos;s Government to force a decision ; I emphasised the heavy proportion which military charges bear to the total expenditure in India and the fact that Army estimates are constant target for political attack in India, and that it is contended with some force that the Army in India is there partly for Imperial as distinct from Indian purposes. I also urged that the offer made by Government of India and my predecessor to refer the question of the Capitation charges to Statutory Commission is not illusory as Worthingtou-Evans and Hoare maintain, for two reasons: first, because an undertaking has been given that if it ultimately be decided that additional payments are due from India liability will be accepted as from 1st April 192G ; secondly, because the Commission is bound in any case to go into the whole question of the financial relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government, including those concerned with military expenditure, and therefore it is very desirable from His Majesty&apos;s Governments point of view that their case, as well as India&apos;s, should be laid before the Commission.2. These arguments did not produce much effect. I find in the Cabinet a strong feeling that the Government of India are adopting a wrong attitude, which some of my colleagues do not hesitate to stigmatise as dishonest, in insisting,that their claim for the total abolition of the capitation payments should be investigated before they consent to pay any increase of contribution even though such increase is result of admitted rise of cost on existing basis of calculation of the rate. I find too that the necessity under which the Secretary of State in Council has found himself ou more than one occasion in recent years of resisting-financial demands made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in connection with military expenditure has created in the mind of the Cabinet the unfortunate impression, which neither I nor my predecessor have been able to remove, that the Government of India and the Secretary of State have the habit of exploiting alleged political difficulties in the Assembly in order to evade payment of just debts, and that they constantly try to shield themselves behind legal technicalities for the same purpose.3. The Cabinet agreed that I should send you a private telegram representing the strong opinion of the Cabinet that India ought to continue to pay a Capitation Rate. The Secretary of State for War proposed that, failing agreement between the War Office and the India Office as to the increased amount, the question of amount should be referred back to the Lord Chancellors Committee. The Prime Minister agreed that I should communicate with you again before any Cabinet decision was taken as to the method of arriving at the amount of the new Capitation Pate.4. I have endeavoured in the preceding paragraphs to give you some idea of the atmospliere in which financial questions affecting India are dealt with in the Cabinet and the hostility with which claims by the Government of India for relief from expenditure jit the expense of Imperial revenues are received. It is because of this atmosphere of suspicion and hostility that I feel bound and have indeed undertaken to put to you, at the risk of covering oft-traversed ground, the following questions, some of which have been discussed before. As the new Secretary of State for India I Avish to be able to place before the Cabinet the opinions of the Viceroy on these questions-
5. Iu the first place, I wish to know whether your Government can now be induced to acquiesce iu a continuance of the capitation charge at an increased rate as from April 1926,. pending examination of the general question of the financial relations between the two Governments which will, no doubt, be made by the Statutory Commission or some body set up by or as a result of it. If so, it should not be difficult for the three Departments here, in consultation with the Government of India, to determine the increased amount to be paid.6. In my private and personal telegram of 15th November I have dealt with the Air Ministry&apos;s claim, and the War Office, I am sure, would not be unreasonable in agreeing to compromise figure. At, the beginning of the year Worthington-Evans offered you, I understand,, a deal on a basis of an increase of between  200,000 and  300,000, and in view of reductions since then would now be prepared, perhaps, to take a middle figure.&apos; 7. If your Government is prepared on further consideration to accept an arrangement of this hind, I should be glad to know how lump sum of arrears and future payments could with least inconvenience be found, i.e. whether by taking them from the savings under Army Contract Grant and if necessary adjusting hy way of compensation the period for which the Army Contract Grant scheme is to be applicable, or by a direct increase of the Army estimates.S. Whichever of these courses is adopted, would new taxation be required ?9. My object is to ascertain from you (1) whether the Government of India are prepared to consent to arrangement outlined above, (2) the reasons for your refusal if you really cannot induce your Government to acquiesce in His Majesty&apos;s Governments view of what is proper course, (3) what would be the political repercussions in India if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to make a determined effort to put pressure on Government of India to consent to arrangement proposed. I shall be grateful if in your reply, which I shall circulate to Cabinet confidentially, you will deal in fullest and frankest manner with each of these three questions.10. 1 should, in conclusion, make it clear that as this matter has not jret been before my Council I cannot predict what view it would take, although if your Government agreed to a compromise on the lines indicated above, I should hope that it would be prepared to sanction the expenditure.Telegram from Viceroy, ISih December 192S.390 C. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 23rdNovember, No. 3345.   Capitation Hate.1. I fully appreciate and sympathise with you in difficult position in which you are placed vis-d-vis the united opposition of the rest of the Cabinet, and I must ask you to believe attitude of myself and of my Government has not been taken without most earnest deliberation and a full realisation of all that may be involved. It is not only that issue of principle itself is, in our opinion, of vital importance ; the occasion of.its presentation is of equal importance, and we were convinced that it must be raised and maintained now.2. It appears desirable, in view of charges which have been made, that I should first recapitulate the general position of Government of India before replying to particular questions asked in your telegram of 23rd November.3. It is not disputed that if, on basis of a strictly commercial relationship, the -Government of India is to be regarded as hiring at cost price the British garrisons in India from British Government, such cost price could fairly be taken to include a proportion of expenses incurred in preliminary training, equipment, &amp;c. But we contend firstly&apos;that, on grounds of general policy and equity, the relationship ought not to be regarded as strictly commercial; secondly, that even i,f it is so regarded, proper proportion of expenses to be borne by India is a matter for argument, and that the principle on which it should be settled has never been clearly established by an independent tribunal.-1. We further contend that India could reasonably make a counter-claim for some financial assistance from Imperial revenues for various reasons which have validity,
hot only in the sphere of general policy, but also within the limits of a strictly commercial relationship.   Important reasons might be stated as follows :--     Because the defence of India is a matter not merely of local, but of Imperial interest.   It might be argued, for example, from the Indian point of view, that ...  the risk of attack by Russia depends largely on the fact that, by attacking India, Russia can strike a blow at England.Secondly. Because the army in India, both British and Indian, constitutes for ; the British Empire a valuable reserve of troops maintained at a high state of efficiency and immediately available in case of need for use in other theatres.Thirdly. Because, in order to provide for co-operation with the British Army possibly in other theatres, it is necessary for the Army in India to adopt the organisation and equipment &quot;of the British Army. It is at least arguable that this involves a higher and more costly standard than would be required if Indian needs alone had to be considered, and the fact that the Government of India has no discretion in this last matter makes Indian opinion particularly sensitive about it.We recognise that it is difficult to assess which country gets, on balance, the greater advantage out of the Imperial connection, and that it is arguable that the British taxpayer at present carries an excessive share of the joint burden of Imperial defence. But if this argument is to be used, it should be brought up in counectioa with a general survey of the distribution of liability between the Home Government and the various parts of the British Empire. On such a broad basis a fair contribution by the Government of India could be justified to the public.5. If there had been no demand made by the British Government to alter the existing standard of contributions we should have been, content to allow the status quo to continue at least until the Simon Commission had reported, because we should have thought it unwise to raise again a controversial issue pending revision, of the consti-tutional position which could hardly be made without giving some consideration to the financial relations between the Indian and the British Governments. When, however, the British Government seeks to introduce some increase in the charge which, if it appears in our Budget, will concentrate public attention on this contro-versial subject and arouse hostile criticism amongst all parties, including the friendly Indian groups and the British commercial circles, we feel bound to demand that no change should be introduced without an impartial enquiry into all the issues, the result of which might be expected to establish principles which we could honestly defend, and which, hy affording an.accepted guide for future practice, would remove this whole question from the present atmosphere of sordid bargaining.6. We do not see how such an enquiry could be inaugurated independently of the Statutory Commission, and we therefore agreed with Lord Birkenhead that the matter should be referred to them, with the idea that they might make some general recommendations regarding the financial relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India, and that, if these were accepted by Parliament, the solution of the particular problem might be simplified, or if not, could be referred to some specially constituted tribunal (vide Lord Birkenhead&apos;s private and personal telegrams of 2nd March 1928 and 13th June 1928).7. Our desire to get principle laid down and our objection to compromising on this matter are not based on any unreasonable refusal to admit any spirit of &quot;give and take&quot; in settling this very difficult question. Our feeling rather is that a compromise at present stage would inevitably and not unreasonably be regarded by Indian public as a private bargain made, between one British Government and another to advantage of British taxpayer. The effect on public opinion in India of such a bargain, made at a time when ail-important issues are supposed to be in suspense pending Report of Simon Commission, would dangerously aggravate an already difficult position, and if in addition the bargain is one which we ourselves feel to be unfair to the Indian taxpayer, we should be put into an intolerable position if we were forced to defend it.8. You must, I think, appreciate from the foregoing statement how unjust it is to accuse us of &quot;taking advantage of the legal position in refusing to compromise on the amount of the claim or to submit the question of amount to arbitration&quot; (vide your telegram of IGth November), or of dishonesty &quot;in insisting that our claim for the
total abolition of capitation payments should be investigated before we consent to pay -any increase of the contribution&quot; (your telegram of 23rd November).9. We must emphasise that we are not defaulting on admitted debts, and we are in fact ready, and have never refused, to submit the question of capitation payments to independent enquiry. We think that this is at some stage inevitable, but naturally if this is done we shall put forward what we consider our just counter-claims ; and, if the award is to be retrospective to 1st April 1926, we shall balance the hope of .getting a refund ou past payments against the chance of having to make good arrears. We also think that the setting up of a tribunal for India should be allowed to arise -out of the constitutional enquiry by the Statutory Commission, and that, pending the results of their enquiry, it would be a grave political blunder to arouse a public -controversy in India on a question of military expenditure. In advancing this view we are not attempting to ;&apos; exploit the alleged political difficulties in the Assembly for the sake&apos;of avoiding payment of our just debts,&quot; but are expressing our appreciation of public feeling throughout the country at a most critical period in the history of British Government in India, when the only hope for the future must depend on maintaining Indian confidence in British justice.10. We regard the installation of an independent tribunal arising out of, or linked Avith, the Statutory Commission as the only method which affords a chance of a satisfactory solution or which -we could honestly defend, and we are quite unable to understand the Lord Chancellor&apos;s accusation that such a suggestion is illusory. The proposal seems to us a natural sequel to result of enquiries by the cabinet Committee, which have followed exactly the course anticipated by Lord Birkenhead in his telegram of 13th June 1928.11. Further, we hold that, if such an independent tribunal is to be set up, it is vital that its composition should be such as to command the confidence both of the Indian and British public, and, from the Indian point of view, the wider the scope that could be given to such an enquiry, on general grounds, of the Imperial defence, the better it Avould be. You will appreciate that Indian opinion will inevitably make comparisons with the manner in which a share in the cost of Imperial defence is borne by the Dominions and other parts of the British Empire.12. I Avill jiow deal with the particular points raised in your telegram of 23rd November.13. Para. 3. For reasons explained above I cannot regard the Lord Chancellors Committee as a satisfactory tribunal to settle this matter. You will readily appreciate how Indian public opinion might doubt the impartiality of a Cabinet Committee, which might be supposed to be influenced by the natural desire of the Government to produce a budget favourable to the British taxpayer on the eve of a General Election.14-. Paras. 5 and 6. We cannot acquiesce in the increase of the capitation charge pending examination of the general question. Indian opinion would undoubtedly interpret this as in some way prejudicing the final issue. An acute controversy Avould arise in the debate on the next budget, the presentation of which will already be difficult owing to.the necessity for explaining the arrangements for maintaining &quot;military expenditure withoui reduction for the next three years.- 15. Paras. 7 and 8. I will deal with these questions although they Avill not arise if the negative view stated above is adopted. I must first emphasise how difficult it would be to justify to the public any postponement of the re-equipment of the Army, the extreme urgency for which has already been stated, and must continue to be stated, as our justification for maintaining the Army Budget at Rs. 55 crores till 1932.The following are the actual financial facts. If we assume the extra amount required annually to be  250,000 for the Army and  60,000 for the Royal Air Force, it would be necessary to provide in. the next budget three years&apos; arrears and current year&apos;s contribution to make a total of  1,240,000. .The Army authorities have definitely stated that for 1929-30, in order to carry out the programme to which they are already committed, they require at least Rs. 55 crores and would like latitude to spend more. If they were pressed to do so, it might perhaps be possible for them to slow down, to some extent in the following years, say half a crore per annum, provided the period of the contract was correspondingly extended. It is difficult to make certain forecasts so far in advance, but the result seems to be that the maximum that could be done without increasing the Army vote
G-would be to find the increased annual contribution of  310,000 as from 1930-1, plus-an annuity of  65,000, towards making up the arrears, and that in order to make this-possible it would be necessary to continue the contract period into a fifth year.If, therefore, more is required, we should be forced to increase the Army vote at the present juncture. This is open to very grave objections, firstly because the mere-,act would arouse universal opposition, secondly because it would quite probably involve increased taxation.It is, of course, difficult to forecast exactly at what point of the increased expenditure additional taxation would become necessary. The following is all we-can say at present. We anticipate a deticit of 60 lakhs on out-turn of the current year. This will reduce Revenue Reserve Fund on present estimates to about 28 lakhs. Probable out-turn of next year is still uncertain ; but, having regard to the failure of the monsoon in many places and to the very bad position of the cotton industry and the labour troubles in various parts of the country, we feel that even on the basis of a continuance of present expenditure a deticit is quite probable. The-balance in the Revenue Reserve Fund of about 28 lakhs is definitely required against this probability. In any case, it will be necessary to refuse grants for many civil projects which are extremely desirable. In particular, we anticipate great difficulty in finding the money even for a small grant to make a start in meeting the recommendations of the Agricultural Commission, and we shall probably be unable-to make any start in building up a reserve against the accruing liabilities on cash certificates. It must be remembered that the remission was made at a time when the-normal revenue was admittedly not large enough to stand it, but it was hoped that in the course of two years the normal increase in revenue would fill in the deficit, and1 that pending this the Revenue: Reserve Fund would bridge the gap.It is already clear that the expectations of normal increase have been delayed, and with a sequence of bad years there may be such further delay as to necessitate an increase in the taxation even without the additional unexpected items of expenditure. Taking a general view, the financial situation over the next few years is likely to be-difficult. As already reported in other correspondence, the result of a programme of heavy capital expenditure, principally on railways, combined with an absence of the-issue of corresponding loans, has created great stringency in Government financial resources. The capital expenditure programme on railways cannot be stopped or seriously curtailed without great loss, and result is that we must contemplate substantial sterling and rupee borrowing over the next few years.It is, therefore, specially important to keep the credit of the Government of India unimpaired, and a series of even small budget deficits might have the most detrimental effect.. This condition must affect the decision as to the point at which hew taxation might become necessary. I need hardly emphasise, after past experience, the-difficulty which there would be in introducing new taxation. Certification would almost certainly be necessary, and obviously the difficulties would be increased if it appeared that the immediate cause for the new taxation was the increased demands of the British Government.16. Para. 9. Questions 1 and 2 have already been dealt with, and question 3 touched upon. I must repeat that the political repercussions of the course suggested might, at present juncture, quite possibly be disastrous. We must be prepared, in any case, for continued agitation against military expenditure, and item which will attract the chief attention is the capitation payment, quite apart from any increase. It will be important that the principles governing this payment should be settled on. a basis which we can openly and honestly defend. The Statutory Commission must, it is almost certain, touch upon these principles. Nothing would be more unfortunate than that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be suspected of forcing up the basis of payment on the eve of the Statutory Commission^ Report. The immediate effect would be to arouse hostile criticism here from all quarters, including those now friendly tons; while in every case where we have to refuse money for desirable objects of expenditure for national benefit, the blanie would be put on this particular action. Apart from this, it is inevitable that any public dissatisfaction on this matter would re-act on the atmosphere for the reception of the Report of the Statutory Commission.17. I have also carefully considered your suggestion that we should at least meet the Air Force claim, but I feel that there could be no justification for treating this separately.   It must inevitably commit us in some degree to accept principles which
would equally apply to the Army, aud effect on public opinion here would be -equally bad.18. On all grounds-stated above our considered conclusion is that the whole basis -of capitation payments ought to be revised by an independent tribunal as a sequel to, or in connection with, the Statutory Commission^ Report. If such a tribunal decides that India must pay more, the situation must be squareby faced, but, pending-such a review, it would be a grave political bhmder to increase the present payments. Whatever is done, would have to he done publicly, without attempt at concealment, ^and it is to us inconceivable that advantage to the British Government of earlier receipt of an additional two or three hundred thousand pounds a year could be regarded as commensurate with the serious objections which I have called attention to.19. I fully appreciate that the Cabinet, in its present attitude, may regard the proposal for reference to the tribunal arising out of the Simon Commission as a device, for temporising on our part, which in fact it is not, and as involving undue -delay ; and if the Cabinet, after due consideration of the arguments advanced above, -consider that an independent tribunal should be set up immediately to consider this particular question, I think that my Government would be prepared to fall in with this course, for we do not wish to be obstructive.&apos; I must, however, state the view that the tribunal ought definitely to be associated with the Commission^ enquiries, -and that the position ought to be fully explained to Simon and his views obtained. My Government would, I feel sure, regard this stipulation as indispensable. On this point please see concluding sentence of last paragraph of my Despatch of 16th February 1928, concluding sentence of my private and personal telegram dated 3rd April, and latter part of para. 1 of my private and personal telegram dated 14th September 1928.
