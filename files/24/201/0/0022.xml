Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     28CP. 22 (29).CABINET.FUNCTIONS OF DOMINION MINISTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.MY colleagues will have seen amongst the Dominion Office telegrams circulated to the Cabinet the correspondence which has taken place with the Dominion Govern-ments, following on the Cabinet decision of the 5th December, as to the form of notification to be made to foreign Governments as regards the appointment of Dominion Ministers at their capitals.The form of draft note which was proposed to the Dominion Governments is reproduced in Appendix (A). The attitude of the various Dominion Governments may be summarised as follows : 1. The Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand are prepared to accept this draft note in its entirety. The Commonwealth Government expressed the opinion that the principles which have been accepted as governing relations between Plis Majesty&apos;s different Govern-ments in matters of foreign policy can very appropriately be applied to the Diplomatic Agents of the various parts of the Empire in the same countries, and that unreserved co-operation between the latter appears to be indispensable if the common interests of the Empire are to be furthered and its diplomatic unity vis-a-vis foreign States fully preserved.2. The Canadian Government agree generally with the terms of the draft note, including the reference to the &quot;diplomatic unity of the Empire&quot; (to which the Cabinet attached importance), &quot;if it is considered necessary to continue making specific references in communications with foreign Governments to the bearing of such appointments on the diplomatic unity of the Empire,&quot; but they suggest the omission of the words defining the meaning of the phrase &quot;diplomatic unity of the Empire&quot; as being likely to involve misunderstanding by the foreign Governments concerned.They also suggest the alteration of the phrase &quot; The....:......................(name of Dominion) Minister would be at all times in the closest touch with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,&quot; to &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in (name of foreign country) would be at all times in the closest touch,&quot; and the omission of the reference at the end of the draft note to questions of precedence.3. The Irish Free State Government now wish to omit from the draft note all reference to diplomatic unity and to the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the Dominion Minister, on the ground that the mention of such matters in a note to a foreign Government would introduce an element of obscurity, and that the definition of the position contained in the draft note is likely to lead to misunderstanding as to the relations between the different parts of the Empire. The despatch from the Irish Free State is reproduced in Appendix (B).4. The Government of the Union of South Africa adopt a similar attitude to that of the Irish Free State Government, i.e., they desire the omission from the draft note of all reference to diplomatic unity (see telegram reproduced in Appendix (C)).[18827] r
In the circumstances I suggest that we should accept the Canadian amended form of the note (as set out in Appendix (D)), which deviates but little from that suggested as a result of the Cabinet decision of the 5th December. I do not imagine that there will be any difficulty in persuading Australia and New Zealand to accept the amended formula, which preserves the point of principle to which they attach importance, though, of course, it would be necessary to consult,them.I think we ought to make a firm,effort to resist any further concessions; and I would recommend that we should use the desire of the Canadian, Union and Free State Governments to appoint Ministers at once as a lever in getting the two last named Governments to agree to a formula which all the rest of us accept.I would accordingly propose that, after obtaining the concurrence of the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments in the Canadian amended text, we should inform the Union and Free State Governments that the text with the Canadian amendments is agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and, we understand, also to the Commonwealth and New Zealand Govern-ments, and that we should point out that foreign Governments, on being notified of any appointment of this nature, will not unnaturally expect some enlightenment as to the relations of the Dominion Minister and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, and that it does not seem to us possible to omit from the formal notification all reference to this matter. We should further say to the Union and Free State Governments that the important point in this connection appears to us to be to make it clear to the foreign Government that the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at a foreign capital will be based on the principle of consultative co-operation, and that any questions as to the best method of dealing with any matter concerning more than one of His Majesty&apos;s Governments will be settled by consultation between them. We should add, as regards the suggestion of the Irish Free State referred to in the para-graph marked (3) above, that an element of obscurity would be introduced by the wording proposed; that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom feel that, as a result of their long experience in diplomatic practice, they can not unreasonably claim to be in a position to judge the effect on a foreign Government of the wording of a diplomatic note of this character; that they are convinced that foreign Govern-ments will expect some explanation of the meaning of the change contemplated, and that the wording now proposed would not leave them in any ambiguity as to the position.We should conclude by saying that we have made a sincere effort to meet the views of all the Dominions, and that it is a matter of grave disappointment to us that those efforts have not been successful; that, having regard to the divergence of opinion, it would not appear possible to agree to any further modification without reference to an Imperial Conference; and that, in the circumstances, as the note in its present form is agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and in three of the five Dominions concerned, and as the communication to the Japanese Government with regard to the Canadian Minister is held up pending a decision as to the form of communication to be made, and a similar position will arise with regard to the prospective Irish Free State Ministers to Paris and Berlin, whose names have been submitted for the King&apos;s approval, we trust that the Irish Free State and Union Governments will see their way to accept the formula as now revised.It would be desirable to inform Sir William Clark of the terms of the telegram to the Union and Free State Governments.L. S. A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, February 1, 1929.
9 Q appendix (A).Form of Notification to be made to Foreign Governments as regards the appointment of Dominion Ministers at their Capitals (as proposed to Dominion Governments &apos;   &apos;-4n Telegram Circular B, No. 137, of 21st December). &apos;Your Excellency,      .;. .-. . ., -   :  ?... -    .:.   ...... .UNDER instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government in (name of Dominion) have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that the handling of matters at (name of foreign capital) relating to (name of Dominion) should be confided to an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to the (name of foreign country) Government. .      ,2. Such a Minister would be accredited by His Majesty the King to the (name of Head of foreign State), and he would be furnished with credentials which would enable him to take charge of all affairs relating to (name of Dominion)&apos;. He would be the ordinary channel of communication with the (name of foreign country) Government on these matters. The arrangements proposed would not denote any departure from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the Empire, that is to say, the principle that all His Majesty&apos;s Governments act in unison in matters which are of common.concern. The (name of Dominion) Minister would be at all times in the closest touch with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, and the best method of dealing with any question which may arise concerning more than one of His Majesty&apos;s Governments or all parts of the British Empire would, be settled by consultation between His Majesty&apos;s representatives.3. In proposing the establishment of a (name of Dominion) Legation, which His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and (name of Dominion) trust will promote the maintenance and development of cordial relations between the British Empire and (name of foreign country), I have been instructed to express the hope that the (name of foreign country) Govern-ment will concur in the appointment of a (name of Dominion) Minister at (name of foreign capital) on the footing I have indicated above. As regards questions such as the precedence to be attributed to the (name of Dominion) Minister or any other points which the (name of foreign country) Government may desire to raise in connection with the appointment, His Majesty&apos;s Governments will await the views of the (name of foreign country) Government. .      ..,APPENDIX (B).Confidential Despatch from the Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 31st December, 1928.Sir,WITH reference to your despatch, Confidential (2), of the 22nd December, 1928, transmitting circular telegrams B, Nos. 135, 136 and 137, concerning the note to be addressed to foreign Governments on the appointment of representatives of Members of the British Commonwealth other than Great Britain, I have the honour to make the following observations : (1.) Free co-operation being the chief operative factor and the fundamental principle determining the existence and maintenance of the British Commonwealth of Nations, it.is of.the,utmost importance to avoid the use of forms or expressions in the proposed note which might lessen the clarity with which that principle was formulated at the Imperial Conference of 1926. It is not at all certain, for instance, that the mere fact of informing foreign Governments of our inter se arrangements for maintaining community of action does not introduce an element of[18827] B 2
y obscurity. The third and fourth sentences, of paragraph 2 of the draft , : note cannot but convey to foreign Governments an impression that there .is some weakness in the capacity of the Members of the Commonwealth to co-operate amongst themselves which calls for the employment of some unusual remedy. Consultative co-operation in all matters of common concern is so obviously based on the common and individual interests of all that there is no need to make provision for it. Least of all should such provision be made in a document the character of which lends a certain element of external compulsion to the acceptance of a principle which requires the most&apos; complete freedom for its successful application in practice.(2.) Diplomatic unity means, in practice, consultative co-operation. Common concern can never be shared in such equal proportions that the opinions of all the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as to the form of action to be taken will be exactly alike, but the solution of common problems is not likely to be less speedy because different methods may be used to solve them. &quot; To act in unison &quot; is not a practical ideal while co-operation leading to common action in matters of vital interest to the common weal is sufficiently obvious to foreign nations as the working principle of the policy of the Commonwealth to dispense with any mention of it in the note. The expression is, moreover, somewhat unhappy. &quot; To act in unison &quot; almost necessarily requires a conductor, and critics of the British Commonwealth of Nations would be only too ready to see in it a new proof that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great - Britain holds the baton. The representatives of the several Governments of His Majesty^ would of necessity keep in close touch with each other for all common purposes, but the statement that the other representatives &quot;would be at all times in the closest touch with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador&apos;&apos; could have no other effect than to weaken the status of those representatives vis-a-vis foreign Governments and to lessen their strength when united action becomes necessary. It is better for the general interests of the Commonwealth that foreign Governments should realise the necessity of attaching considerable importance to the views of each one of the several Governments. If the Ambassador is declared to have a preponderating and pivotal position, the other representatives will be regarded as so many, automata, and they will become powerless as operative factors in the general interest.(3.) With regard to the concluding sentences of the draft note concerning the precedence of the new Ministers Plenipotentiary, there is a danger that any special reference to precedence may be regarded as a form of acquiescence beforehand in some modification of the general custom.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State are in complete agree-ment with the view expressed in Circular Telegram B, No. 136, that there should be the fullest interchange of information on all matters of common concern both between His Majesty&apos;s Governments and between His Majesty&apos;s representatives at foreign capitals. It seems more practical, however, to wait until actual experience of the new situation enables us to discover the best methods of consultation rather than to impose on ourselves, at this stage, a laborious system of exchanging masses of documents, which for the most part would remain unread.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State consider that the note should be addressed to the foreign Government by the Minister for External Affairs of the Government concerned, through the diplomatic channel. The note would read as follows: &quot;I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government in (the Irish Free State) have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that the handling of matters at (Paris) relating to the (Irish Free State) should be confided to an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to (the French Government).(2.) Such a Minister would be accredited by His Majesty the King to (the President.of the French Republic), and he would be furnished with credentials which would enable him to take charge of all affairs relating to the (Irish Free State). He would be the ordinary channel of communication with (the Government of the Republic) in these matters.
APPENDIX (C).Telegram from the Minister of External Affairs, Union of South Africa, to the Secretary of Slate for Dominion Affairs.Dated 21st January, 1929.CONFIDENTIAL, No. 4.Your telegrams of 21st December, Circular B, Nos. 135, 136 and 137. Following for Prime Minister from Prime Minister. Begins: In connection with question as to terms which should in future be contained in the letters formally notifying to a foreign Government the desire of a. Dominion Government to appoint a Minister to such (? foreign Government), I have carefully considered the proposed alterations in the old form of note. I am glad to learn that the British Government appreciate the necessity for a revision of the terms in which such notification is in future to be conveyed, but wish to submit that proposed alterations are inappropriate to the new situation since 1926, and if adopted will not do away with objectionable features of the old form.While I am prepared in general to accepting that &quot; the general principle under-lying the relations between Has Majesty&apos;s Governments Diplomatic Representatives at a foreign capital, where there is more than one such representative &quot; should &apos;&apos; generally speaking be the same as applies in relations between the respective Governments in regard to foreign policy &apos;&apos;; and while I am prepared to give adhesion to the words of the Prime Minister of Canada in Circular telegram B, No. 137, of the 21st December, I submit that not only is there no necessity for communicating formally to a foreign Power those principles underlying the Commonwealth co-operation, but that any such communications, especially if made by the British Government and upon an occasion as here contemplated, must inevitably have the effect of bringing such Foreign Governments under the impression that whatever may have been declared as to the status of the Dominions there still does exist an element of subordination and patronage.This is all the more objectionable when that communication is couched in terms of an ambiguous character such as contained in the phrase &quot; the principle of diplomatic unity.&quot;This phrase is not only ambiguous in spite of the explanatory words now proposed; but it dates from a time anterior to 1926, and, therefore, because of its old association with the doctrine of an Empire super-authority, is bound to mislead and give rise to a false conception of Dominion status.I am, therefore, of the opinion that it is highly inadvisable that any such communication should be made in the Note, and that all that such a Note should contain is a simple and plain intimation to the Foreign Government concerned of the desire of the Dominion to be represented through a Minister, and a general indication as to what his functions with such Government would be.For this reason I am of the opinion that the form of the Note to be addressed to a Foreign State should, if originating with, and upon instructions by the BritishV  &apos;&quot; (3.) In-proposing the establishment1 of an (Irish Legation) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the (Irish Free State) trust that it will promote the maintenance and development of cordial relatipns not only between (France) and the (Irish) Free State), but also between (France) and the whole British Commonwealth of ; Nations.&quot;&apos;   &apos; &apos;I have the honour to be,i iiM Sir, - \ -i+m f &apos;      &apos;t!    %m.: -Your most obedient, humble Servant, P. McGILLIGAN,Minister for External A ffairs.
rGovernment on behalf of the Dominion concerned, read as follows (assuming the Union and Franceias the parties involved) , .  &apos;      . r&quot; Monsieur le President, &apos;&apos; r&apos; -     , * *1&quot;Under instructions from (.. . . ) I have the honour&apos;to inform ; your v Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain has been requested by His majesty&apos;s government in the Union of South Africa to communicate to . your Excellency the desire on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union that the handling of matters at Paris relating to the Union should be confided to an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to the Government of the Republic. Such a Minister would be accredited by His Majesty the King to the President of the French Republic, and would be furnished with credentials which would enable him to take charge of all affairs relating to the Union. He would be the ordinary channel of communication with the Government of the Republic on these matters.&quot;2. In communicating to you these proposals, which His&quot;Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the Union trust will promote the maintenance and development of cordial relations, not only between France and the Union, but also between France and the whole British Commonwealth of Nations, I have been instructed to express to your Excellency the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union that the Government of the Republic will concur in the appointment of a Union Minister as set forth above.&quot;In the case, however, of the Note being issued upon instructions direct from the-Dominion concerned, the form would undergo a corresponding change.From the form given, it will be seen amongst others that, according to our view paragraph 2 of Circular Wire B, No. 137, should end with the word matter(s) at the end of the second sentence, and that the last sentence in paragraph 3 should be omitted.As to interchange of information referred to in Circular B, No. 136, I fully agree as to the desirability of a full and frank interchange; and also that there should be as free an interchange as possible of copies of communications on matters of common concern. The risk of publication, however, of such documents, and the serious consequences which such publication might involve, must be sufficient reason for leaving it at all times to the free discretion of the representative concerned, and of his Government as to whether such interchange should take place or not.I wish to impress the necessity of adopting a form of Note such as the above which will avoid all appearance of derogating from equality of status and will prevent any wrong interference.   Ends.APPENDIX (D).Form of Notification to be made to Foreign Governments, amended in accordance with the Suggestions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada.Your Excellency,UNDER instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government in (name of Dominion) have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that the handling of matters at (name of Foreign capital) relating to (name of Dominion) should be confided to an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to the (name of foreign country) Government.2. Such a Minister would be accredited by His Majesty the King to the (name of Head of foreign State), and he would be furnished with credentials which would enable him to take charge of all affairs relating to (name of Dominion). He would be the ordinary channel of communication with the (name of foreign country) Government on these matters. The arrangements proposed would not denote any departure from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the Empire. His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in (name of foreign country) would be at all times in the closest
touch; and the best method of dealing with any question which may arise concerning more than one of His Majesty&apos;s Governments or all parts of the British Empire -would be settled by consultation between His Majesty&apos;s representatives.J- In proposing the establishment of a (name of Dominion) Legation, which His Majesty s: Governments m the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and (name of Dominion) trust will.promote the maintenance and&apos;develop-ment of cordial relations between the British Empire and (name of foreign country) I have been instructed to express the hope that the (name of foreign country) Govern-ment will concur in the appointment of a (name of Dominion) Minister at (name of foreign capital) on the footing I have indicated above.
