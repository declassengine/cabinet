Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1929.SECRET. Copy hu-,CP. 6 (29).CABINET.NEW TRANSFER SCHEME AND ROAD WORKS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.I AM not at all satisfied with the way in which proposals are coming forward from Local Authorities under the scheme announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last November for the encouragement of relief works on which transferred-labour is employed. Under this scheme specially favourable financial terms are given on condition that 50 per cent, of the labour consists of men transferred from the depressed areas.We shall, of course, be asked to state in the House of Commons what results we have secured from this scheme and the other schemes announced before the recess. The Cabinet decided against a number of proposals including one embracing a road programme that were thought to provide opportunities for transfer,&quot; and this makes it all the more important to consider carefully what is the best that can be done with those that were approved. The alternative is to reconsider the extended programme.In the meantime public attention is again being directed to road schemes as affecting unemployment, and we shall be asked what our policy is. It will be remembered that a programme of trunk road reconstruction in England and Wales and Scotland costing  8,000,000* was not approved by the Cabinet, t It was, however, decided that the revised Unemployment Grants Committee scheme should include road works on non-classified roads, towards which grants are not being made by the Ministry of Transport. J. The works which Local Authorities in general are keen to do are, however, road improvements on their more important roads, and this is just the kind of employment which is suitable for transferred labour.When Local Authorities are canvassed the answer given, in case after case, is that the Authority are anxious to put important road work in hand, and are not disposed to spend their money on anything else. Moreover, there is usually reluctance to employ transferred labour, and to overcome this reluctance it is necessary to give the Authority the sort of scheme on which they are really keen.Obviously this is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. The biggest field for transfer, and the best in many ways, is road work, and we ought surely to devise some way of linking up the two things instead of keeping them apart. Some additional grant (beyond the present 50 per cent, from the Road Fund) would of course be necessary in order to enable transferred labour to be employed. Possibly the Road Fund may have money available which could be used for this purpose. These are details which will need careful consideration, and I suggest that a Committee should be set up to recommend without delay the best form of financial arrangements and other details of a plan for meeting the situation. I think the Committee might also review the position as disclosed by reports upon the progress made with all schemes since the beginning of November.I should add that, if anything useful is to be achieved within a reasonable time, a very early decision is essential.(Initialled) A.
