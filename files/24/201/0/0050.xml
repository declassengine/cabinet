DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. CABINET.p.50 (29). Memorandum by the Minister of Transport on&quot;- Clauses in certain Local and Private Bills now before Parliament which have the effect of protecting particular Road transport undertakings from competition.A question of importance arises in connection with certain -Local and Private Bills promoted during the present Session of Parliament.In the course of last Session proposals were made in two Bills, the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Traction Bill and-the Greenock and-Port Glasgow.Tramways Company*s Bill, to confer on the -promoting companies a large measure of protection against competition in respect of their passenger road transport services. The essence of these provisions was that,-so.long as the Companies maintain adequate and-satisfactory services (including workmen&apos;s services)., no licences to ply for hire along certain specified routes with omnibuses should be granted by the licensing authorities concerned except by way of renewal of existing licences.    The attention .of the Select Committees was drawn to the unusual nature of the provisions in my Department .&apos;s Reports on - the Bills , but they decided to allow the Clauses.With the possible.exception of a local Aet which was passed in&apos;1914.under different conditions the provisions in these Clauses introduced.an entirely new. principle in local legislation.Fourteen of the Local and. Private Bills promoted during the present1 Session:..(and eight Scottish Provisional Orders) contain provisions.on similar lines.    The  clauses vary in different cases, some providing for a more extreme form of protection than others.,There are both advantages and disadvantages attaching to this method of dealing with the problems to which competition between, road transport undertakings give rise In different parts of the country, and when the relevant clause in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Traction Bill was debated in the House of Commons on
Second. Reading, I expressed myself in favour of allowing it to go forward to be considered in Committee.    It had already been&apos; allowed in the House of Lords.    Since that time, however, the situation has been completely altered by the setting up of the -Royal Commission-on Transport.The Royal Commission are clearly concerned with any local variations in the general lav/ governing the running of road vehicles and are particularly concerned with questions relating to the co-ordination of traffic.I have received the following letter from its Chairman:-&quot;1st February, 1929&quot;.&apos; &quot;My dear Minister,&apos;  &apos;*&apos;   :   : &apos;.. In a Memorandum of Evidence which has been submitted by the Municipal Tramways and Transport Association (Incorporated), the attention of. the Royal Commission on Transport is called to some eighteen-Private Bills, now before Parliament, in which there are provisions relating to. the protection from competition&apos; of the road passenger transport services of the . promoters;    six of these Bills are promoted by municipalities and twelve by companies. . In substance, these provisions    if not actually conferring a monopoly, at least give the respective undertakers an opportunity of obtaining what isfor all practical purposes, a complete monopoly of the provision of passenger transport services&apos; on ;particular .routes.Although it is hardly necessary for me to do, so, ---*- &apos;   I attach a copy of the Terras of Reference to the Commission-.Having regard to these Terms, the Commission yesterday considered that which they, understand to be the principle involved in the Bills.  &quot;It may be that \\     . the solution to some of the problems of transport in this country will be found in the limitation of unrestricted competition, but &quot;my colleagues and I feel strongly that &apos; while the Commission is pursuing its inquiries into the . r subject, it would be most undesirable that an entirely&apos;new class -of statutory transport undertaker   should be created with special-rights and liabilities which my &apos; easily, and probably will, add considerably to the complexity of the problems with which the Commission is dealing.- &apos;   . ;   -There is the further consideration that if these clauses were  allowed, an. even larger number of Bills containing similar provisions might be introduced next Session, before any general legislation on the subject&quot; could be promoted.    When once quasi-monopolies of this nature are established they cannot easily be extinguished and the existence of such rights might very well render the problem of the co-ordination of&quot;passenger transport-   incapable, of any satisfactory solution.   ...
4 I&quot; Cii u uThe terms of reference referred to in this letter are as follows:-&quot;To take into consideration the problems arising out of the growth of road traffic, and, with a view to securing the employment of the available means of transport in Great Britain (including transport by sea coastwise and by ferries) to the greatest public advantage, to consider and report what measures, if any, should be adopted for their better regulation and control, and, so far as is desirable in the public interest, to promote their co-ordinated working and deve development &quot;.I agree with the Commission that It would be most undesirable that at this stage statutory transport undertakings should obtain special rights and liabilities which may easily, and probably will, add considerably to the complexity of the problems with which the Commission are dealing and may not be in harmony with recommendations which they may wish to make.I seek authority therefore to move an instruction to the Committees of Parliament which will examine these Bills that clauses of this nature which fetter the free exercise of the discretion of individual licensing authorities and limit the jurisdiction reposed in me by Section 14 (3) of the Roads Act, 1920, be disallowed,.    I understand that one resolution can be framed to cover all the cases.(ltd. ) W.A.21st February, 1929.Coramissioners realise, of course, that these particular Bills are not before them, but they wish to take the earliest opportunity of acquainting you with their views , and of suggesting that the Government should take such steps as may be considered necessary to prevent, or at any rate postpone, the grant of powers of the nature sought in these measures until after the Commission has presented its Report.Yours sincerely,(Sgd. ) Arthur G. Boscawen&quot;.
