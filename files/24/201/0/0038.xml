THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.

CABINET.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT (SCOTLAND ) BILL.

Clause 17 - Payment of allowances by County Councils.

MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND.

I desire to refer my colleagues to the memorandum which I circulated on 2nd November last (C.P.332 (28)) on the subject of the allowances and expenses of members of the reconstituted local authorities to be set up by the Local Government (Scotland) Bill, which was considered by the Cabinet on 5th November last. (C.49 (28)11).

In accordance with the decision then reached the clause was redrafted so as to limit the power to incur expenditure to payment of necessary travelling expenses and allowances of members of County Authorities (omitting Town Council) and omitting payment for loss of remunerative time.

During the progress of the Committee Stage of the Bill on Friday last (Hansard, cols.  2104-2119) Scottish members of all parties combined in urging upon the Government to accept an amendment the effect of which would have been to confer power on county councils to pay such allowances. In view of the strong feeling of the House and the fears expressed that, under the Clause as it stands, working men would be excluded from membership of the county councils and therefore from taking their duo share in local government, I gave an undertaking that before the Report Stage of the Bill was reached I would reconsider the whole question.

Events have closely followed the course which I anticipated in my previous Memorandum on this subject, and it is certain that our political opponents will make the most of a refusal of the Government to permit the local authorities to grant these allowances, the cost of which will fall entirely upon local rates.

It does not seem to me to be worth while to antagonise Scottish working class opinion by withholding this concession, and I feel strongly that the working classes other than the Trade Union official may to some extent be debarred from participation in local government work as members of local authorities if it is not granted.
I would not propose to extend, the power beyond the County Authorities which in Scotland cover wade areas - where - transport is Blow and difficult.&apos; JOHN GILMOCJRt .Scottish Offioe. 13th February, 1929 .\
