SECRET.CP. 19 (29)CABINET.EVACUATION OPERATIONS AT KABUL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I THINK my colleagues may be interested to read the annexed extracts from two private letters which have been received from Sir Geoffrey Salmond, the Air Officer Commanding in India, describing the course of the recent evacuation operations at Kabul, since some time must elapse before the official despatches, which will, of course, be sent forward through the Government of India to the India Office, can be prepared and transmitted to this country.S. II,Air Ministry, January 30, 1929.Extracts from Private Letters from Sir Geoffrey Salmond, Air Officer Commanding-in India, on the Subject of the Kabul Evacuation Operations.&quot;3v* &quot;IP &quot;V\ IfIt was on the 3rd December, whilst I was on manoeuvres, that Sir Francis Humphrys first mentioned the question of evacuation, and suggested that, if he could obtain the King&apos;s consent, the R.A.F. should run a weekly or bi-weekly mail service to Kabul in order to replace the weekly lorry service which had been suspended for some 3 weeks. As the Commander-in-Chief was also at the manoeuvres, I obtained his agreement immediately to the weekly or bi-weekly air mail service, We also proceeded with plans for evacuation of the women and children.-Jc* $fc - . &apos;     &apos; 1 &apos; *3v- ^ 4PBefore communication was definitely cut off, numerous communications had passed between Sir Francis Humphrys and us in regard to the numbers of women and children that we might be asked to evacuate, details of the landing ground. at Sherpur, whether there were any other suitable sites near the Legation, and so on.On the 17th December, Kabul civil wireless began, at 8-55 in the morning, to send a message from Humphrys, which asked that the women and children should be evacuated and that aeroplanes should be sent immediately for reconnaissance. This message was broken off in the middle, but a confirmation of it was received via. Quetta at 5-15 in the evening.Now it was clearly impossible to evacuate the women and children unless the time and place for the evacuation had been settled beforehand. We therefore despatched a machine piloted by Flying Officer Trusk at 8 o&apos;clock on the morning of the 18th with a set of Popham panel signals made out specially to meet the occasion, and informed Humphrys that a second machine would arrive later in the day to read the Popham signals. Owing to the distance involved and the fact that contrary winds might be expected, we did not think that a machine could remain over the Legation for more than 15 minutes before it had to return. Accordingly Flying Officer Trusk went off on the morning of the 18th, but was shot down after dropping a Popham panel. His wireless operator, L. A. C. Donaldson, wired the fact that they had been shot down before they landed, and another machine was sent up at 1 p.m., Flight Lieut. Prendergast being the pilot, with instructions to drop Popham panel oh the Legation, as we could not be certain that the original[18802]Copy No.    t-if/d-i       Printed for the, Cabinet.   Januaryr 1929.
Popham panel had been dropped by Trusk. When he af rivgid over the Legation, the signals were laid out in white letters with the instructions &quot; Don&apos;t land; all is well.&quot; He was heavily fired at. Clearly, therefore, the idea of evacuation had been abandoned for the time.,On the 19th, Flight Lieut. Pelly was despatched to Kabul. Generally, the sainejsignals were observed, also two Popham panel signals : &quot; Sherpur aerodrome unfit; we are confined to Legation.&quot;   The machine was&apos;heavily fired upon.On&apos; the 20th, Flying Officer Fullergood left at 8 a.m. and dropped his message successfully from 1,200 feet. Various signals were displayed, including one &quot;Situation improving.&quot; A second machine, piloted by FyLieut. Smetham, left at 1 p.m. in order to get Humphrys&apos; answer, also carrying an Aldis lamp, which was to be dropped by parachute in the Legation in order to assist communications. He found the usual signals laid out, also a ground signal &quot; Don&apos;t land at all,&quot; but could see nothing in the way of a &quot;yes &quot; or &quot;no.&quot; In order to make certain of the Aldis lamp getting into the Legation grounds, he came down to 600 feet under heavy fire from houses adjacent to and within 1,000 yards of the Legation. Fie had one]flying wire shot away and another shot through the fuselage. Although only 600 feet over the Legation, he could see no one. I gathered from this, firstly, that no one could move outside the Legation at all during daylight, and, secondly, that for this reason no reply to Sir Denys Bray&apos;s message about landing at Sherpur could be put out. It seemed clear that the Legation was under fire, and that the signals to our aeroplanes were only put out at night. This new consideration was, of course, reported and discussed with the Foreign Secretary, with whom, all the time, I was in close touch.On the 21st, Flying Officer McKee left at 8 a.m., but was compelled to return owing to ignition failure over Jalalabad. He landed at Peshawar safely. A second machine therefore left Peshawar at 9 a.m. piloted by Flying Officer Wisher, and the panel signal he saw said &quot; Come again to-morrow, don&apos;t land at all,&quot; and a large clear signal &apos;&apos; No &apos;&apos; alongside. The Aldis lamp was seen transmitting from an upper window, but signals could not be received owing to screening from other Legations&apos; buildings. Flying Officer Wisher came to the conclusion that, although a great deal of firing was going on, the aeroplane was not being fired at. The firing itself seemed to come from the northern end of a ridge of hills south-west of the Legation. He remained over the Legation and Kabul for 45 minutes, and the firing was continuous all the time.The main result of this reconnaissance of the 21st was that Humphrys did not desire us to land as Sherpur. . . . This made it clear that Humphrys was in an extremely difficult position.1 On the 22nd, Flight Lieut. Prendergast, with an air gunner, left at 8 -10 a.m. and returned at 12-25 p.m. The usual signals were displayed, with the additional information that he was receiving Peshawar W/T signals, also &quot;Come again to-morrow; don&apos;t land, all&apos;s well.&quot; &quot; Aldis lamp transmission failed owing to dull light,&quot; &amp;c. The Aldis lamp this time was operated from underneath a wall, confirm-ing our opinion that it was dangerous for anyone to move out in the Legation grounds. The machine was heavily fired upon.The above summary brings us to the evening of the 22nd. It appeared imperative that we should make an effort to drop a transmitting set on the Legation, since, in the event of a forced evacuation being required at any time, it would facilitate its success. Also, the situation was obviously extremely delicate for Humphrys, and I felt it imperative to do something which would enable us to co-operate more closely. This wireless set was a hand generator set, which had been put together by the Group under instructions from this headquarters. In view of the fact that it was most necessary to make certain that a transmitting set would drop in the Legation grounds, it was necessary that the pilot selected should come down low, in wdiich case he would be shot up. I decided, therefore, that a decoy machine should appear first over the Legation and attract attention by dropping a, parachute just before the officer selected to drop the wireless set appeared flying low over the Legation. These orders had been issued for the 23rd, when suddenly a &quot; clear the line &quot; message came through from Humphrys saying that he wanted the evacua-tion to take place the following day. I first heard of this telegram from the Group, as it had not been received at Delhi. You can imagine my feelings when, in the absence of the telegram itself, I thought that the evacuation now asked for by Humphrys had to be a forced evacuation.   All I had was information saying that at 11 a.m.
that day Rrendergast,had been heavily fired at and that the situation was clearly extremely difficult for. Humphrys.    However,&apos; in a very short time I-received Humphrys&apos; telegram which was to the effect that, that afternoon two Afghan officials had been to see him and informed him that he could evacuate the women&apos;and&apos; children,  as soon as arrangements could be made,  from , Sherpur aerodr.omelB Actually, the Afghans had forced the rebels away from the Legation about noon on the 22nd.   The Group&apos;s proposal, to which I agreed, was as follows:   Squadron^ Leader Nicholas and Plying Officer Lacy, operating the wireless on the Wapiti, were to leave so as to be over Kabul half an hour before the evacuating machines arrived. The latter consisted of three 9a&apos;s and a Victoria.   It will interest you to know that the wireless sent out by Nicholas during his flight was intercepted by us at Delhi, At 8-10 a.m. Nicholas signalled &quot;Landing Kabul, weather perfect.&quot;  At 10*18; a.m. the Wapiti signalled the Victoria &quot;Families evacuated 10 o&apos;clock; 9a&apos;s, with, luggage, leaving shortly.   Everything in order.&quot;   At 10-20 we had a bad time because we suddenly intercepted a forced landing message, part of which, was jammed.   It turned out, however, that Nicholas had trouble with his petrol just after leaving and had to land again at Sherpur.   At 12-25 I received a message stating that all had landed safely.  All the passengers were conveyed in the Victoria, the 9a&apos;s bringing luggage only  The evacuation itself took ten minutes only.   The women and children evacuated were all British subjects.Humphrys now asked for further evacuation for the women and children of the other Legations. In order to make certain that everything was in order on the following day, the Wapiti was sent over Kabul at 9 a.m., and, after receiving certain pre-arranged signals from the Legation, he wirelessed through to say he was landing. The evacuating machines consisted of the Victoria and two formations of 6 D.H.9a&apos;s each. The Victoria left Risalpur at 10 o&apos;clock, and the two 9a formations at 10-15. They were all back by 3-30 p.m., except .two 9a&apos;s, which followed shortly. The delay in the 9a&apos;s&apos; return was due to a German woman,; who ran into the. propeller of one of them and was seriously injured. The propeller of Trusk&apos;s machine was changed for the damaged one.After a discussion with Humphrys, it was arranged that the next evacuation should take place on the 26th, since the situation was not quite so urgent, as the rebels had been driven off a good distance to the north of the Legation. In order, however, that nothing should go wrong on the 25th, we asked Humphrys to get a message through to us by land line or by Afghan civil wireless, which was working again, by 10 a.m. on Christmas Day. As no message came, we sent a machine over to Kabul to see whether everything was in order. This machine landed at Sherpur a,nd fOund that everything was in order, and returned with detailed arrangements for the evacuation that was to take place on the 26th. On the morning of the 26th the Victoria and four 9a&apos;s left at 10 o&apos;clock according to programme, carried out the evacuation successfully, and landed safely at Peshawar. The numbers evacuated so far are as follows :  .On the 23rd : 20 British women and children.On the 24th: 28 German and French women and children.On the 26th: 23 nationalities unknown.Arrangements were made for a further evacuation on the 27th. This has now been cancelled owing to a heavy fall of snow having taken place at Kabul during the night and rendering the aerodrome unserviceable.* * * * * * ..,&quot;.-!,:One of the conditions of the situation was that, by Humphrys&apos; special desire, none of our fellows went over the lines armed. All machine guns were removed and the crew carried no revolvers at all. This was because Humphrys did not wish, in the event of a forced landing occurring, the impression to get about that we were doing anything except looking after the Legation. It was a trying situation for those fellows to go over day after day and be heavily fired upon and not be allowed to hit back. Of course, they all understood it, and their determination and gallantry is something of which we can always be proud.^ -K* ^ w *X* .*. 1 z.1 &apos;-iSince I wrrote previously, we have completed all the evacuations that Humphrys feels are immediately required.....The further evacuations were as follows :-December 29          ... ... ...          ...        31December 30         ... ... ...         ... .      23f,y..,;  ,     . .

As I stated in my letter,&apos; there was a heavy fall of show on the night of the j 26th/27th at Kabul, and the evacuation for the 27th was cancelled by a wireless signal from Humphrys. However, on the 28th he signalled through that Trusk had made a reconnaissance of Sherpur aerodrome, and, provided a further fall of snow did not take place, we ought to be able to land on the 29th. There were then five inches of snow on Sherpur aerodrome, and we calculated that anything up to six inches could be negotiated. Therefore on the 29th the Hinaidi and Victoria went up and evacuated 31 women and children. On the 30th, by arrangement with Humphrys, we sent up two fitters with a new engine and radiator for Trusks machine and left them on Sherpur aerodrome to install the engine. The return of the Victoria brought back 23 people. On the 1st January we sent up a pilot and a rigger by Victoria to Sherpur, the pilot to fly back the machine and the rigger to patch the tailplane and fuselage of Trusk&apos;s machine which had been shot through. The Victoria returned accompanied by the D.H.9a, leaving the engine, which is beyond repair, as a present to the Afghan Air Force.Thus ends the second phase of these Kabul operations and, as soon as I saw them&quot; coming to an end, I asked Denys Bray to wire to Humphrys asking him to arrange with the Afghan Government that a weekly mail service should be put into force, as I thought it was important that we should not lose touch by air with the Legation and that the more we conrmunicated with Kabul, the more used the Afghans would get to seeing our machines flying over, which might be of value in future. When it was first mooted by Humphrys, before things became critical at Kabul, that we should start a weekly service, you will remember that we had agreed provided the King gave his authority. At that time he had stipulated that the carriage of mails should be reciprocal and that Junkers machines, piloted by Germans or Afghans, should be allowed to land at Peshawar. Humphrys had objected to this, and before anything could happen the balloon went up. I discussed this question of reciprocity with Bray and we both agreed that, under the circumstances, if at this later stage the King still stipulated for reciprocity, we would agree to it, as the all-important thing was to maintain contact by air. .... I felt that all the King&apos;s Junkers machines would be required for other purposes, and it was very unlikely that he would ask for reciprocity. This proved to be the case, as all that he has asked for is that we should carry back Afghan air mails and that these should be accompanied by an Afghan courier. I am very pleased that we have got this arranged, as I think it is an important arrangement which may bear fruit in the future. vTrusk is being retained by the Legation at Humphrys&apos; request because he has been of great use to him in arranging all these landings at Sherpur with the Afghan Air Commander. By the way, I asked Humphrys if he agreed to convey our thanks to the Afghan Air Commander for the facilities he had rendered, and Humphrys has now wired to say that he has done this. As far as I can make out, the Russians have done nothing but help in this business. You will remember that a D.H.9a, piloted by a Russian, came down in the Kurram some time ago. We looked after the two Russians in every way at Kohat, so much so that the Russian Minister at Kabul sent us his thanks for the treatment afforded them. Probably this all helped in this crisis. I also want Trusk to remain in the Legation, because he might be extremely useful in the event of a forced (or otherwise) evacuation of the Legations&apos; staffs. I have asked Humphrys to let me know the exact numbers that, under certain, circumstances, might be involved in an evacuation of all the Legations.We have heard from Humphrys that the Russians themselves have evacuated a certain number of women and children. It is interesting that all the nations, except the Russians, have preferred to evacuate their women and children to India by the Royal Air Force rather than to utilise Russian machines. In due course, I Will let you have a complete list of all the nationals that we have evacuated, but probably you already have them.* * * * * *o
