Printed for the Cabinet. February 1929.Gopy No.    28CP. 24 (29).CABINET.DOMINION INSTRUMENTS OF RATIFICATION AND THE USE OFTHE GREAT SEAL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN connection with the negotiations for the ratification of the Kellogg Pact by all parts of the Empire, it appeared, from a letter which I received from Mr. McGilligan, Minister for External Affairs in the Irish Free State, and also from semi-official communications from the High Commissioner^ Office, that the Free State Government were feeling doubts as to the propriety of the present procedure with regard to the preparation of instruments of ratification of treaties, such as the Kellogg Pact, in respect of the Dominions, and especially as to the use of the Great Seal.In view of the great importance of getting the Kellogg Pact ratified without delay, and in order to avoid, if possible, a most undesirable controversy over a matter of real importance to the unity of the Empire, I deemed it expedient to convey immediately to the Free State Government a statement of the views of the Government here on the points in question.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of the state-ment, the terms of which were agreed in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.L. S. A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, February 2, 1929.APPENDIX.THE resolution of the 1923 Imperial Conference relating to international agreements provided that &quot; the existing practice in connection with the ratification of treaties should be maintained,&quot; and defined this practice as being, inter alia, that &quot; the ratification of treaties imposing obligations on one part of the Empire is effected at the instance of the Government of that part.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom have always regarded this as meaning that the advice on which His Majesty acts in ratifying a treaty on behalf of a self-Governing Dominion is that of the Government of that Dominion. In their opinion, the observations of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of 1926 in regard to Dominion legislation are equally applicable to the ratification of such a treaty. &quot; It would not be in accordance with constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in any matter apper-taining to the affairs of a Dominion, against the views of the Government of that Dominion. The appropriate procedure with regard to projected legislation in one of the self-governing parts of the Empire which may affect the interests of other self-governing parts is previous consultation between His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the several parts concerned.&quot; [18828]  .SECRET.
When the advice of a Dominion Government to His Majesty to ratify a treaty on behalf of that Dominion is received, the formal procedure which ensues is as follows : The instrument of ratification and the warrant for the imposition of the Great Seal are prepared in the Foreign Office and presented to His Majesty by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who, after His Majesty has signed these documents, countersigns the warrant, but not the instrument of ratification. The documents are then transmitted to the Lord Chancellor, who, being so instructed by the warrant, causes the Great Seal to be affixed to the instrument of ratification.The fact that these formal steps are taken under the instructions of His Majesty by two of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the United Kingdom is in no way inconsistent with the governing principle that the advice on which His Majesty acts in giving these instructions is that of the Dominion Government concerned alone. As the King is geographically situated in the United Kingdom, the actual presentation of instruments of this nature to&apos;him must be made by a Minister in the United Kingdom, but the effective action in Dominion matters is that of the Ministers of the Dominion concerned, and the function of the United Kingdom Ministers consists only in operating, under His Majesty&apos;s instructions, certain constitutional machinery which has been set in motion on the advice of the Dominion Government. The Great Seal is the seal of His Majesty, without which his signature on such documents as an instrument of ratification is invalid. It is not a United Kingdom seal but &quot; The Great Seal of the Realm,&quot; that is to say, the Seal of the King as Sovereign of all His Majesty&apos;s dominions. The Seal is necessarily situated geographically in the United Kingdom and is in the keeping of the Lord Chancellor, but, when the King is advised by the Ministers of a Dominion to sign an instrument of ratification on behalf of that Dominion, then the warrant to the Lord Chancellor to affix the Seal and the Lord Chancellors action both follow automatically from the Dominion Ministers&apos; advice.It follows from the above that, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, the fact that certain action by United Kingdom Ministers is called for in connection with the ratification of a treaty on behalf of a Dominion does not give them any measure of control over the Government of that Dominion in connection with the treaty concerned, nor involve any subordination of the Dominion Government to the Government in the United Kingdom in this respect. Once a Dominion Government has advised His Majesty to ratify a treaty on behalf of that Dominion, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom do not regard them-selves as at liberty to advise His Majesty to the contrary effect; any Inter-Imperial questions which may arise in connection with the treaty should have been previously disposed of by consultation under the arrangements as to the negotiation of treaties contained in the 1926 Report.
