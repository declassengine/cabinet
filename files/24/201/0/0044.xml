Copy No.^CAB I N E T.TRADE     OUTLOOK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, reports which I have received from members of my Advisory Council, regarding the trade position and prospects.The improvement In trade reported last month appears to be maintained.     The January export figures, to which I have already drawn attention, are satisfactory.     The outlook, generally, as given in this report Is reasonably good for the next few months, and the evidence from the retail   trade shows that there Is better buying now than a year ago, and that this improvement applies to the North as well as to the South,At present, orders for coal are coming in fast.     This is no doubt largely due to weather conditions at home and abroad, and in a less degree to the threat of a Polish strike;    but the opinion of coal owners is that prospects for the next few months are distinctly better.     I have repeatedly warned the Cabinet that increased sales of coal would not be accompanied by a proportionate improvement in employment.     It will be seen from Mr. v&quot;arham&apos;s report that while output is now up to the average Of March 1925, employment is only 80% of the corresponding figure at that time.The output in steel has also increased, and Imports have been reduoed.     Prices here and abroad are tending to harden, and I think that the steel trade have found that they have a market In Canada for general as well as special steel.     There are constant complaints of the shortage of-1-
1 q 0fj O \Jscrap;    and I have again suggested to the steel industry, that they should see whether they cannot arrive at a combined buying arrangement with the principal scrap merchants.The consumption of non-ferrous metals is steady, and fairly satisfactory.The steady flow of orders for ships, which have been placed in the last few months, will keep shipyards busy for a considerable time.     Marine engineering works are already profiting thereby, and will do so still more as the year goes on.     Shipbuilding orders have a welcome tendency to return to steam.      This is important and hopeful;   but it would be a mistake to exaggerate the results as the choice between steam and motors will continue to be decided mainly by the character of the service and the ports from which the ships operate.     There appears, also, to be some improvement in general engineering.In cotton, the American section is slightly better, but the Egyptian section is depressed.     The Lancashire. Cotton Corporation has been launched and has on the whole had a good reception.     One of the obvious economies in the &quot;cotton trade is to be found in the buying of cotton and It is satisfactory to note that the Liverpool Cotton Exchange has Intimated Its willingness to work in with the new Corporation on reasonable terms.In the woollen and worsted trades, the position can best be described as &quot;patchy and uncertain&apos;5, and I am afraid the outlook is poor.In the chemical Industry, there has been a very satisfactory expansion.     The general volume of trade has improved and new developments have been made.In other Industries, there does not appear to be any-thing very marked to report.     The boot trade is quiet; pottery rather better;   hosiery quiet at home but export
business fair.     In lace, the outlook is good.     The rubber manufacturing trade is fairly satisfactory.The considered report given by Mr. Johnston on the effect on the rubber industry of the removal of rubber restrictions Is interesting and important.     He says: &quot;The decision of the Government entirely to remove the restrictions from the 1st November last was violently criticised, almost equally by the rubber growers and by the manufacturers.     He had no doubt the growers were still suffering under a sense of injury, although the situation created ^ould probably be to their eventual good.     As regards the manufacturers, however, It was only right to say that the prophecies of disaster had not been borne out by the event.     There was no doubt that, when the heavy fall In prices came, following on the Prime minister&apos;s announce-ment, all the manufacturers found themselves with considerable stocks on hand, bought at higher prices and contracted for at higher prices also;   but, owing to the very fact that all were more or less in the same situation, there was no really serious fall in the selling price of manufactured goods, and the eventual result was that most concerns had, after a period of considerable anxiety, got through most of their commitments without any serious loss. This was due, he thought, very largely to the fact that not the slightest inkling of the Governments intention had been allowed to get out in advance.     Though there was a good deal of &apos;Inspired&apos; information at the time, this turned out to be entirely wrong.&quot;P. C-L.Board of Trade,21st February, 1929.

VLARHAM wrote;-&quot;The weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for the three weeks ended January 19th 1929 w&amp;s:-Week ended January   5th     -       4,100,000 tons. &quot; &quot; &quot;       12th     -       5,215,000   &quot;&quot; &quot; &quot;       19th     -       5,248,000   &quot;&quot;The output In the week ended January 19th was 100.2$ of tb.3  March 1925 weekly average basis.     The number of persons employed in the industry for the week ended January 19th was 80.4/S calculated on the same basis.     Unemployment for the month of December was 19.1% as compared with 25.3% in November and 9.4% In March 192 6.     The quantity of coal exported from Great Britain in December was 4,184,327 tons as compared with 4,231,234 tons in November, the average value per ton f.o.b. being the same as November, viz., 15/6.&quot;The collieries have now become really busy, and, as far as I can see,, they will be fully employed for the next two or three months.     Whether there will be enough trade, when the winter demand ceases, to keep going at the present outputs it is too early to say, but the outlook generally seems much more hopeful.&quot;The exports from Poland show a falling off, as Is shown by the following table:Total.       From Danzig. From Gdynia.

The same heavy winter demand throughout Europe Is causing very strong enquiry for coal In all the exporting districts in Great Britain.     To assist in realising the serious effect of Polish competition, I give below particulars of exports from GreatBritain to Scandinavia for the years 1913, 1927 and 1928:TotalNorway.      Sweden.

COAL (CONTD.)&quot;I enclose an account of the British coal trade in 1928, which may be of interest to the Council.&quot;The year 1928 proved to be one of extreme difficulty for the British coal industry, and the returns of output and export Indicate that the depression which descended upon the industry In 1925., although checked in Its progress, has not yet been overcome.    As will appear from the sequel, the unremitting efforts of colliery owners to bring down cost of production , have not been without effect.    The fact, however, remains that Great Britain has not been able in the aggregate to increase its foreign trade in coal, which is the field -^here expansion is important.    Other European countries on the other hand have been able to increase their output, for though world production of coal, including the coal equivalent of lignite, in 1928, estimated to be approximately 1,315 million tons, showed a decrease of some 29 million tons as compared with 1927, this reduction took place almost entirely on the American continent, European production remaining practically at the same level in 1927 and 1928.&quot;The share of Great Britain in the European total of 669 million tons decreased, however, by approximately 13 million tons, whereas the output in Germany, including the coal equivalent of lignite, Increased by 2/3 million tons, that of Poland by 2i million tons, that of Holland by 1-jr- million tons and that of Russia by 5 million tons.   Production in Belgium, France and Spain remained at approximately the same level In the two years.   A comparison with the year 19.13 shows in a striking manner the extent to which Great Britain has lost ground to other producing countries in Europe,   British output was no less than 49-jr million tons below the 1913 level, while Belgium shows an increase of 5 million tons, France an increase of 8 million tons, Germany an Increase of 27 million tons, the Netherlands $ne of 9 million tons and Russia an increase of 7 million tons.&quot;The export trade of Great Britain felt even more strongly the effects of Polish competition, and was hampered by the various restrictions Imposed upon the imports of coal by other countries.    German reparation deliveries and the action taken by Germany in excluding imports of coal from Poland, which may itself be considered as one of the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles,   have also been responsible to a very large extent for the depression in the British expert markets.    It is a significant fact that of the total reduction of 25 million tons which has been suffered by this country in export markets, no less than 16 million tons have been lost in countries affected directly or indirectly by the reparations and treaty arrange-ments,   Russia has been responsible for the withdrawal of demand for 6 million tons, and In all the remaining markets Great Britain has lost only 4 million tons.   Apart from Belgium, the countries receiving reparation deliveries of coal, via.. France and Italy, imported 6 million tons less from Great Britain in 1928 than in 1913, whereas total exports from Germany and the Saar to these two countries increased by 7 million tons in the case of coal, though the reduction In the exports of coke are equivalent to 1% million tons of coal.    The Scandinavian countries received 5-J- million tons of coal less from Great Britain in 1928 than in 1913, while Poland, whose exports to those destinations were negligible in 1913, sent 6 million tons to Baltic countries in 1928,

The 1928 figure Is 12% above the 1913 level and 22.5  above that of 1909-13.&quot;it is of interest in this connection to compare the trend of export trade in Great Britain with that in Germany and certain other continental countries.    In 1928 Germany exported 24 million tons of coal, whereas In 1927 her shipments abroad aggregated 27 million tons, and in 1913 from the present territory of Germany 23.7 million tons.    Polish exports, which amounted approximately to 8 million tons in 1913, and were distributed chiefly in Austria and Hungary and only to a very insignificant degree to Danzig and Northern markets, totalled 13 million tons.   Holland, whose production did not amount to 2 million tons in 1913, exported in 1928, 3.9 million tons, destined chiefly for France and Belgium. Holland also imported 8.8 million tons, 6.5 million tons from Germany, 1.8 million tons from Great Britain.&quot;Exports from the United Kingdom to Germany increased during the year to 5.4 million tons as against 4.25 million tons in 1927. In 1913 Germany imported 8.8 million tons of coal from Great Britain.    Imports into Italy totalled 12.6 million tons, a slight reduction on the previous year&apos;s figure of 14,1 million tons, but imports from Great Britain increased slightly, rising from 6.4 million tons in 1927 to 6.5 million tons in 1928.    Imports into France in 1928, which totalled 17.3 million tons, were rather less than in 1927 when they aggregated 19 million tons.    Imports from Great Britain decreased to some extent, while exports from Germany showed a decrease of 1.7 million tons.    The Scandinavian markets as a whole imported less coal in 1928 than In 1927 and 0.9 million tons less than in 1913.
u J UOPAL. (cointd.)&quot;The inland market, in Great Britain in 1928 was also depressed, the inland consumption being estimated at 166^ million tons as compared with 180 million tons in 1927 and 184 million tons in 1913.

In the two principle competing countries there were increases of wages during the year, but the level of wages and costs of production remained considerably below those in Great Britain.     In Germany wages were increased in May 1928 by Q% and wages cost of production Increased from 8/4 per ton commercially disposable in December 1927 to 8/8 per ton commercially disposable In October 1928.    In Poland an increase of wages was given in September, 1928, as a result of which the earnings of the miners were increased by 6%*   Costs of production in Poland were, however, maintained at the same level in consequence of the increased output, amounting to 6/5 per ton.SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES.Imports into Italy.	1913.-st	1927.	19J28.

There are indications that the improved demand will be maintained in the Immediate future, and this, coupled with the improved exportation has led to the reduction of stocks and the disposal of the output.The home trade in coal is&quot; somewhat better, but so far there is little improvement in price.    The demand for export for certain classes of coal, especially unscreened coking and screened steam coal, has been very good, at higher prices. Business forward has been done at a substantial premium on prices ruling last year.    Rouse coal has- been in good request.
COAL (CONTD. )MR. MITCHELL reported a considerable improvement in the position of the coal trade in Scotland.    There was an increased output, higher prices vrere being obtained and It was probable that some of the collieries that had been stopped would resume operations.    Of course it was impossible to say whether this improvement was permanent or temporary, but it was no doubt largely due to the cold weather, which had prevailed all over the Continent as well as here and had led to an improvement in the shipping demand as well as the local demand.    The bad weather had hampered traffic on the Polish railways and this, and the fear of a threatened strike in Poland, was causing a demand for our coal.IRON AND STEEL.MR, BOND said that from   many points of view the December figures for iron and steel were the most satisfactory of the year, for although, owing to the Christmas holidays, steel production had. been some 80,000 tens less than in November, It was nearly 80,000 tons in excess of the previous December, Imports of iron and steel at 183,600 tons were lower by nearly 100,000 tons than in the previous December, and were in fact lower than in any month since May 1926, the previous lowest having been in September, 1928, when they were 184,500 tsms.    Exports of iron and steel amounted to 359,000 tons, which was slightly higher than the average monthly rate throughout the year.     Prices were firm with a slight tendency to harden.    Prices of Continental steel had hardened a good deal, and in many products we were able to compete with the Continental prices,Reports from the various centres showed that on the North-East Coast the   rate of production during January had noticeably Increased over December, and but for the fact that some of the larger concerns were idle during the first few days of the New Year, the total production for the month would have been higher than for December, but the works in this district were idle for more days during January than during December,    The tonnage on the order books at the end of January showed an increase over the previous month, although rails were still a disappointing feature;    and the prospects for February suggested that the present    improvement, would be maintained.    The shipbuilding Industry remained active, but the constructional trade was not very satisfactory, especially in the London area.    Competition from abroad was not very noticeable In the home market as far as plates and sections were concerned, but It was still strong for joists and semi-finished material.    Competition In foreign markets was still very severe.   Prices of raw materials were showing an upward tendency, and in the case of scrap had been influenced by heavy exports which had resulted in a shortage of this material.
CONFIDENTIAL.IKON AND STEEL  (CONTD. )The increased production of steel had led to a temporary scarcity of pig-iron, which was being   met from Lincolnshire and the Midlands.    Steps were, however, being taken to increase the local production of pig-iron, and Messrs. Dorman Long,were re-lighting blast furnaces at Redcar and Newport.Reports from Scotland stated that a good start had been made after the New Year holidays and production was gradually approaching what It had been immediately prior to the stoppage. There was, however, a dearth of scrap in Scotland which was somewhat hampering progress.    Order books were generally better filled, and prospects, due to additional work placed on the Clyde, were looked upon as being good for some time into the year.   Foreign competition was not so intense, and exports might be said, on account of concentrated efforts to produce an improvement, to be steadier, with some better prospects in the near future.    Generally there were grounds for hoping that, at least for a few months ahead, the Industry in Scotland would be more active and production on a somewhat higher level than had been the case for some time.    The wrought-iron trade in Scotland was idle, except in two works, owing to a wages dispute, and it was understood that this industry could only be carried on If the terms offered by the employers were not rejected by the men.In South Y/ales the steel works were busy, but here again they were hampered by shortage of scrap.    Imports of scrap into this country had been curtailed by statutes in other countries, and exports from this country during the past twelve months had been large;    consequently the supply of scrap here was very much depleted.   Competition, which formerly kept down the price owing to offers from abroad, had been largely stopped because of the curtailment by France and other countries of the export of scrap.THE PRESIDENT stated that as the result of negotiations with the French, we had succeeded in getting them to take off their export prohibition, but there was still some arrangement by which they limited the amount going to different countries. They had given us an undertaking to allot us a certain amount. Apparently, however, we had never taken that amount.MR, BOND said that was so. It was a question of price. On the other hand, he believed that the export of scrap last year had been in the neighbourhood of as much as 350,000 tonsvTHE PRESIDENT suggested that this was a matter which affected the whole of the steel industry, and that the Manufacturers&apos; Federation might do well to look into it,MR. BOND agreed.   Continuing, he stated that the tinplate industry was not in a satisfactory condition.    The industry, by agreement among manufacturers, was stopping three weeks in every thirteen, but the demand was Insufficient to absorb even that reduced output.    A serious statement had appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; recently.    The Chairman of the Tariff Commission in Canada had recently stated that the v:elsh Tinplate Manufacturers had made
CONFIDENTIAL.IRON AND STEEL  (CONTD.)an agreement with the American Tinplate Manufacturers handing over the Canadian market to the Americans.    That statement was not correct.   V/e had made an agreement with the American manufacturers with regard to combined exports.   We had taken 70 per cent, and they had taken 30 per cent, but part of the arrangement was that we should be entitled to ship to Canada a larger quantity of tinplate than we had done during the past year.TIG PRESIDENT remarked that the Department of Overseas Trade had obtained from the ^elsh Tinplate Manufacturers an authoritative statement on the situation, to be passed through Sir William Clark to the Canadian Government,MR. PUGH stated that his reports bore out to some extent what had been said by Mr. Bond and Sir Arthur Balfour.      The position was certainly more hopeful than it had been for some time, and the volume of employment seemed to be increasing.The Pig-iron trade was   making progress.     There had been two extra furnaces put in on the North-east coast, one of which, however, was working on ferro-silicon and the other on hematite.    Incidentally&quot;they had found that Germany had re-entered the Birmingham market for billets, at a price approximating to that&quot;of Belgian and French manufacturers.With regard to the trouble in the wrought-iron trade In Scotland, to which Mr. Bond had referred, Mr. Pugh explained that there were four     firms who were making certain demands with regard to wages and hours.    The issue at the moment was not whether those firms could carry on, but whether they were applying the constitutional procedure recognised by the iron and steel industry.      The matter was important, and if the firms in question could be induced to conform to the traditional procedure\ire in making their demands, serious reactions over the industry as a whole might be avoided.MR. MITCHELL referred to the position of scrap, which was serious.     Supplies were scarce,  the price had risen, and a sufficient quantity could not be got to keep the steel works properly employed.    This had led to an increased demand for pig-iron.    The position of pig-iron in the country generally was, however, better.     A certain amount of the scrap exported was not ordinary melting scrap, but consisted of test pieces etc. which sold at a higher value than the ordinary scrap used In melting furnaces.    It was not distinguished in the terms of scrap exported, but it could be detected by Its greater value, which was as high as  4 per ton.    A good quantity was sent to China and other places for special purposes.
A (1 9yfc U K,IRON AND STEEL  (CONTD).LORD GAINFORD reported to the following effect:-In consequence of one of the Cleveland makers transferring in January the balance of their make of foundry iron to basic an immediate    shortage showed itself, and further large purchases of Lincolnshire basic were made to supplement the already too short production of local basic hot metal.     This naturally had a reflex influence on iron for foundry purposes and local make is now barely sufficient to meet existing demands.     From a cost standpoint it is doubtful whether further furnaces will be put into operation on foundry iron. One furnace has been transferred from the manufacture of hematite pig iron to basic, and an additional furnace was blown in during January to make hematite.     Stocks throughout the country which, in some districts are understood to have been of large dimensions, are now reported to have been disposed of so that it Is thus expected the price of hematite will quickly and materially improve.The number of shipbuilding orders placed during December has hardly been maintained throughout January though, no doubt, the steel required for the frames of ships has materially assisted steel makers to keep their mills in operation.     Orders for structural steel seem to be more restricted than they were towards the end of last year. There has been a good demand for billets.In Germany, a lull in buying for the home market was reported during the second half of January.     More Interest has, therefore, been taken in the export trade, In spite of increas-ing costs.      In France, it is said that the output Is only limited by the amount of labour available and that additional workmen are being recruited from Czecho-Slovakia.     Of the total French output of steel,    60% is exported.STEEL,SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR observed that the home trade had slowed-down slightly since the last meeting of the Council.     It had been rather disappointing that the shipbuilding and heavy engineering trades had not been able to order from Sheffield quite so much as was anticipated.     More business was, however, being done with Germany In better-class steels. The French situation was quite hopeless:    no business was being done with France.     Spanish business, In spite of all the troubles with their tariff, was fair.     As to the Spanish tariff.-,   considerable amendments had been effected with the help of the Board of Trade and of H.M. Ambassador there, and with the co-operation of traders in this country, and there was no doubt that we had got most of what we desired in most of the items which we had questioned.     There appeared to be just a slight hitch at the last moment, but It was probably not of serious importance.
STEEL    (CONTD).The trade in steels with Canada was the best which Sir Arthur had known.     The results of their harvest were showing themselves in general trade now, and there was really a very hopeful situation in Canada.     New Zealand was equally good.     Australia was decidedly good; though there had been a bad slump in the Commonwealth, a steady Improve-ment was taking place.     As to South America we could not complain, although prices were very bad, and there was tremendous German competition there,  as well as American competition.      In the United States there, was very little to be done, but it was curious that we were beginning to sell alloys there in fairly large quantities, entirely on quality; but they were going to increase their duties on alloys and tool steel.     Sir A. Balfour was going to Washington to see what the position was.     He was afraid that Mr. Hoover was not   favourable to us in regard to these matters and that we would have a very difficult situation to face.     Japan was a steadily Improving market, and in the better-class trade we were holding our own again there.In the United Kingdom there was a bigger consumption of alloys than at any time since the war.     That was a very good sign.NON-FERROUS METALS,CAPTAIN LYTTELTON mentioned that figures had been prepared last year, showing the consumption of non-ferrous metals and the trades in which they were used.     In leadper cent went into sheets, pipes and chemical lead, 23 per cent was taken by cables, 17-1 per cent went to white lead red lead and litharge,  and 8 per cent to accumulators.   With regard to spelter, the galvanisera&apos; consumption was 68 per cent, the brass founders&apos; 27 per cent and the rollers and miscellaneous 5 per cent.     In regard to tin, 48 per cent went into the tin and terne plate trade, about 20 per cent went into the solder trade, about 12 ner cent Into Babbit metal, and 20 per cent was used for miscellaneous purposes.Last year the consumption of all non-ferrous metals, except tin, was very steady.     In tin the consumption was 28,000 tons as compared with 23,700 tons in 1927.     The consumption of copper was 164,000 tons - 1,000 tons more than in 1927, while lead consumption was 240,000 tons and spelter 180,000 tons.For the last month the principal demand for copper had been from the cable works and wire drawers,  and that trade was very satisfactory.     In lead the principal demand was also from the cable works.     Spelter had been freely bought by the galvanisers and orders were good.     In tin the buying had been very strong, though not from the tin plate trade.     On the whole, business was fairly steady.
NQN-FERROUS METALS (OONTD.).Captain Lyttleton referred, as a matter of general interest, to two interesting events that had happened in copper.    The amount of copper controlled by the British Empire was very small, and there had been two very serious efforts made by America, which at preserit controlled about Q0% of the world&apos;s production, to get control of the copper which was likely to be produced in the Empire.    In Eastern Canada there was some very high grade ore in the loranda Field, and great attempts had been made by the Americans to get hold of that copper.   We had, however, stopped them there, and had got the copper coming from there under British control..   The other field was in Rhodesia.    In the course of the previous week the American refiners had endeavoured to obtain control of that field, but there again we had succeeded in stopping them.    He thought there was a reasonable prospect of both those fields remaining under British control.ENGINEERING.MR. RICHMOND wrote:-11 In Marine Engineering I am glad to report that, generally, there is increased activity since the opening of the year, and anticipations of improvement are confirmed from the various marine engineering centres.   Many of the vessels ordered in recent months have not yet reached the stage when the engineering equipment calls for the full complement of workers, so that a few months should show a favourable decrease in the unemployment figures of the industry.    There were on hand at the beginning of the year 95 merchant vessels as compared with 80 vessels at the end of September last, and it is significant to note that of these 33 were motor ships and 55 were steam ships.   Recent improvement in steam equipment, such as the Oeardmore Caprotti valve gear, and the various arrangements of supplementary exhaust turbines added to the reciprocating engine, have improved the efficiency of the steam engine considerably, and made it more attractive to shipowners, and the number of steam vessels lately placed indicates a tendency to return to steam propulsion; but the conditions of the special trade routes on which ships will be employed will still largely determine the choice.&quot;On the North East Coast a better outlook is also reported, and the six destroyers placed in the district, two with Hawthorn Leslie, two with Palmers, and two to be engined by Wallsend Company, although not to be begun till April, will absorb a good proportion of men, and the completion of the Light cruiser &quot;SUSSEX&quot; in this district makes those additions all the more welcome.    This district has been hardest hit by the depression and still has the largest proportion of unemployed, but an improvement has already begun and this should become more pronounoed as
ENGINEERING (CONTD.).the year advances.    The bulk of the work recently placed consists of cargo carriers - either oil or coal burning -and of increasing size and speed, with some special vessels for whaling purposes, and Messrs. Armstrong Thitworth^s Chilean tankers.    Messrs. Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson have secured a contract for a 6,000 ton vessel for a Marseilles Company.&quot;On the Mersey a good amount of new construction work is under way and the engineering and repair works of the district show a fair amount of activity.    On the Clyde, the Canadian Pacific contracts, two passage vessels for the Southern Railway, two new destroyers, and a fair amount of cargo tonnage, form a good nucleus with which to start the year and a better feeling in marine engineering circles is apparent.    There is considerable activity in regard to new proposals.    The turbo-electric drive is receiving increased attention as well as marine pulverised fuel installations.    The wages question is still in abeyance and nothing definite can be reported at this stage.&quot;General engineering in Scotland has slightly improved. Machine tool makers are fairly active and negotiations for Russian orders are likely to oome to a decisive stage shortly.    An order for 44 locomotives for the Indian State Railways has been taken by Messrs. 3eardmore, Dalmuir. Business prospects in general engineering In Scotland can be said to be more encouraging&quot;.SIR ERNEST PETTER wrote:-&quot;With the ascertainment of the relevant data for December, the statistical record for the prat year is no?/ complete, and we are enabled to make a survey of the industrial and trade conditions which obtained in 1028, with particular reference to the engineering and allied industries.    The year which has now expired marked the completion of the first decade since the Armistice, a considerable interval of time; but it has not seen the recovery in our national basic industries which has always been greatly desired, and at various times has been confidently expected.    This consideration perhaps emphasizes the superficially disappointing character of the past year. During the early months of 1028 engineering industry enjoyed a continuation of the relatively favourable post-strike conditions of 1937, but thereafter experienced a slight, but steady, retrogression which was mainly due to a decline of demand in the home market.    There is, however, good reason to anticipate a moderate improvement In the condition of the industry in the early months of the new year.    There have recently been signs, particularly in electrical engineering and in shipbuilding, of an appreoiable expansion in the   volume of new business.    It is hoped al30 that rationalisation and other internal
CONFIDENTIAL.ENGINEERING (COETD. )economies, which in their operation have contributed to the apparently adverse movement in 1928, will begin to show beneficial results in the current year,&quot;Now that the December figures are available, the actual totals for the year 1928 of the leading statistics of production and foreign trade in relation to engineering industry can be examined.   From these statistics it will   be seen that on balance the quantities of coal and of iron and steel consumed in this country in 1928 were appreciably less than in the preceding year;    these data, it should   be noted, are generally accepted as approximate indications of the relative state of industrial activity in the country.    The reduced productivity of Industry during 1928 as compared with 1927, which they Imply, Is certainly confirmed both by the comparative unemployment statistics and by the Indices of national production which are now compiled by the Board of Trade, and have been published from time to time.    The most pleasing features to note are the increases in the exports of machinery, and in the tonnage of vessels launched from shipbuilding yards;    fuller reference in each instance will be made later in these notes.&quot;Comparing the average extent of unemployment amongst Insured workpeople in engineering and cognate industries, i-t. will be found that whereas general unemployment was appreciably greater in 1928 than 1927, engineering unemployment on the whole was less, although naturally the position varied as between the several branches of the industry.   As providing another aspect, and also a confirmation of the above, it is interesting to state that an estimate worked out on the basis of the numbers, employed by deducting those unemployed from the total numbers insured, shows that whereas the volume of employment in all trades and industries declined in 1928 by 0.4$ approximately compared with 1927,^ employment in the engineering Industry increased by 1.5$.&quot;With regard to foreign trade, as already observed last month, 1928 has been a very satisfactory year, compared with those preceding, in the exports of engineering products. Compared with preceding years, the declared value of the combined export of metal, engineering and allied products (iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, cutlery, etc., electrical goods and apparatus, machinery and vehicles) exceeded that of 1927 by 5$ and that of 1925 by fully 7$, and when correction is made to eliminate the changes in price levels the volume of exports is found to be 16,6$ greater than in 1925.    It should also be noted that the corresponding Imports, although less in declared value than in 1927 or. 1925, have increased in volume
ENGINEERING    (CONTD.) .by 5.5?o since tbe latter year.    The exports of machinery in 1928 aggregated 566,153 tons (a record for a post-war year), as compared with 512,156 tons in 1927, and 689,389 tons in 1913.    The tonnage of imported machinery in 1923 was 98,545 tons as against 101,945 tons in 1927.    The average value per ton of exports in 1928 was  94,9 and of imports  169.8, almost Q0% higher than that of exports.&quot;The latest shipbuilding statistics published show that a larger volume of tonnage was launched in this country in 1938 than 1927, while the amount of tonnage commenced in the last quarter of the year appreciably exceeded the tonnage completed;&quot;   this augurs well for the state of shipbuilding itself and of its correlated industrial activities.11MOTOR VEHICLES AND RAIL7AY MATERIAL.SIR JOHN THORNYOROFT remarked that there was no marked change in the motor-car business at the present time.    The makers of heavier vehicles had had a good many orders from railway companies and also from the Indian Grovernment,    Their output was probably increasing, but there was no change in the output of car manufacturers as a whole.    As regards exports, there had been a considerable increase to South Africa, which consisted almost entirely of the Austin &quot;seven&quot;, but he did not think the exports to other parts of the world had changed very much.    There v\ras undoubtedly a desire on the part of the South African Government to buy British, but in the country generally it would be found that the Americans had not only got the private car market, but were pushing very hard for the heavier vehicles as well.    General Motors had established at Port Elizabeth an assembly plant where they employed over 600 white workers.    The bodies were built there in order to save the duty, and they were assembling vehicles which they rather sought to suggest were of South African manufacture.    Obviously they were not a South African product, but a little had been gained by being able to say that they were the product of General Motors,  South Africa.    Some of the English manufacturers had recently had representatives out there, and Sir J. Thornycroft    did *not think they had done much good to this country by suggesting that it was impossible to produce a car which would compete with the American imported car, and that the only thing the British makers could do would be to get a oar, called an Empire car, which would come from Canada, its primary place of origin being somewhat doubtful.    It was surprising to see the extent to which America had dominated the vehicle market in South Africa, not only for motor vehicles but also for agricultural machinery, of which there was very little going from this country. The International Harvester Company had depots all over the country, and they not only allowed long-term
CONFIDENTIAL. MOTOR VEHICLES AND RAILWAY MATERIAL  (CONTD).payments, but they would secure payment on a man&apos;s crops many years hence.    It was very difficult to compete with that sort of thing.With regard to the South African railways, he had been there recently and had found a very genuine desire on the part of managers of railways to place their orders in this country. That was borne out by an order for  250,000 worth of bogies which had been placed a month or six weeks ago.   There would be a good deal more work coming shortly from the railways in South Africa. They had had very bad samples of rails from the Continent and America, and they had also had trouble over locomotives made in Germany.   These locomotives had not turned out so successful as those made in this country, and that fact ought to give British locomotive manufacturers quite a good chance in the future.THE PRESIDENT mentioned that information of that kind had, he knew, been widely, but discreetly, used by the representatives of the Department of Overseas Trade.   When a defect had been discovered in foreign material,  careful use had been made of the fact, and the Department^ representatives had also been able to take very useful action in one or two cases where British goods were not quite up to the mark.   He had one instance in mind when the action of our Overseas representative had been quite in-valuable in arriving at a very satisfactory settlement.SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT had gathered from representatives of English firms that they considered the propaganda methods of the official trade representatives of America to be more effective than ours.   Our Trade Commissioners seemed to think that their primary object was to collect statistics and send them home for the Department of Overseas Trade to circulate and let the trade know what was happening.    But the firms interested had already got those statistics for themselves and did not want them sent round to other people, who might be competitors.   The Americans worked on different lines.    He understood the American Trade Commissioners simply said; &quot;American goods are the best.    We do not want to tell you what you ought to do for your country.   We can only tell you what other countries are doing in the way of buying American goods&quot;.    In the motor industry, as well as in other industries, the American repre-sentatives did their utmost, by propaganda, to show that other countries bought American goods and that therefore the people in South Africa would be wise to follow their example.COTTON.SIR KENNETH STEWART said that the market in January for cotton goods opened pretty well, but showed signs of a drop in demand towards the end. of the month.    In India the demand was fairly good,  but in China the New Year&apos;s holidays of three weeks&apos; duration which were still in progress had caused an almost total slacking off in business.    In another ten days we might expect to find out how the settlement had gone off.   The Chinese settled their bills about once a year, and they had to see how they&apos; stood before they could decide what they would do in the next year.    Generally speaking, just after the holidays, if they had had a fairly good settlement, one saw the
COTTON  (CONTD.)effect&apos;.    This year we had considerable hopes that prospects would be better, at any rate for the next few months.   Before the holidays orders had been very much better than for quite a long time past.   South America had remained normal, though business was more spasmodic than usual.    The position was not a very encouraging one from the point of view of new orders.One interesting matter for the cotton trade had been the registration of the new Lancashire Cotton Corporation which had as its object the amalgamation of several of the most important mills with a view to attempting some sort of reform on both the financial and productive sides of the business. It had had a very good press and the directors were now busy absorbing a large number of mills, and in a month or two they ought to be putting some of their schemes into operation. The first stage in the negotiations was concluded at the beginning of February when the very big creditors of the mills had agreed to accept the new Corporations securities, and the Bank of England had guaranteed sufficient new money to enable the Corporation to work on a thoroughly well financed basis. Now that that part of the negotiation was over, for the next six months they would have to be collecting all the mills that were ready to come in, and there might be anything from 100 to 150 of these.   After that it was proposed to go to the public, or something of the kind - the underwriting was already arranged, Sir Kenneth believed - to enable the Corporation to get the necessary new money to carry out a great number of reforms both from the mechanical and other sides of the business, so that they could start in and try to get back some of the 2,000 million yards of-trade that had been lost in the last 15 years.    Of course, that trade had partly been lost through many countries In the world supplying much of their own requirements in piece goods by mills erected in their own territory, but quite a large proportion had been lost through the great advance of one or two countries, more especially Japan and Italy, In the science of producing these goods for export in competition with ourselves.   We had considerable hopes that by introducing rather more scientific productive methods into our trade we should be able to get back quite a fair proportion of our lost business.    It remained to be seen whether those hopes would be realized, but we were going to have a very good try.&apos; MR,LEE wrote&quot;We In the textile trade are naturally   very pleased that the new spinning combination is now about to take form, and we are hoping that this may have a very good influence, not only on the particular section it affects, but on the general trade in the &apos;bread and cheese&apos; Lancashire business.    It will naturally depend on how the new combination   is run, and it will   be  necessary to how a considerable amount of patience before it Is possible to tell whether our hopes will be realised or not.    Quite apart from this, I should think that the coarse trade may be looked upon,  if anything, as slightly better than it was a month ago, and the outlook to be distinctly more hopeful.    On the other hand, the fine trade, that using Egyptian cotton, is distinctly ivorse.
COTTON  (CONTD.).The little spurt that was evident in August, September, and October, has entirely died out, and it seems quite impossible today to get sufficient orders to keep the machinery running full time.    Should there be no alteration in the demand at an early moment it is perfectly certain that this trade will have to curtail production in the spinning to meet the curtailment that has taken place in the weaving section of the trade, and also in the export of fine yarns to the continent. In addition, the trade has hanging over it at the moment a dispute on cleaning time, and, altogether, the feeling and the conditions are not as comfortable as they were some time ago.&quot;I hope at the next meeting that I may have a better report to put before the Council.&quot;MR. AYKROYD reported that the position in the wool textile trade at the present moment was full of complexity.    Wi had just completed another series of wool sales in London; and these sales, notwithstanding that the quantities offered were comparatively small, had revealed a very uncertain position with regard to the basis of values.    In the overseas market competition still kept keen.    A very notable feature was the case of Japan.    Before the War she had imported from Australia about 3,000 bales of wool.    The corresponding figure last year was 136,466 bales, showing how the Japanese were doing their own work now instead of taking the same quantity of partly manufactured material from us.In ^consequence of the Safeguarding inquiry, markets were quiet.    Everyone was waiting to see what the result would be.In woolcombing, the commission combers were running badly, but an improvement had occurred with top-making firms, who were all fairly busy.   That is, so far as fine wools were concerned.    For medium crossbreds and low quality wools the machinery was running very badly, mainly three days a week, and some of it not running at all.    In the worsted spinning there was no change to report.    At least 30 per cent of the spindles were standing and prospects appeared to be very bad. The strike in Saxony was affecting the two-fold spinners, and until this was over new business from that quarter must remain in suspense.In the Yeadon and G-uiseley districts matters had improved a little; most of the machinery was running full time, and a few firms were running night shifts.    In the low-class goods, where we had been Importing from other countries, the prospects of Safeguarding were making all the firms busy; and,  from being in a state of stagnation, they were now running night and day in that district.    The firms employed in making fine worsted goods from merino wool were getting quieter, because large quantities were being bought in anticipation of wool.
WOOL (CONTD.).Safeguarding, so as to get as much as possible into this country beforehand.    In the Huddersfield district the manu-facturers of fine goods were getting orders, mainly from South America, and there was a promise of a better Spring season than last year.    The Fancy trade in Huddersfield was better, and the Dress trade more promising.    In the Cleckheaton area, machinery was only fairly well employed.With regard to eosport, Russia had been buying considerable quantities of tops and raw material during the last month, and were likely ,to be in the market again next month.    Slowly and gradually they were establishing themselves and getting credit fairly freely   notwithstanding that the. insurance market for Russian bills was limited.    It was believed that .they were getting credit even without the insurance of their bills.It was reported that in Canada most of the firms in the textile trade were working night and day.    They had bought pretty heavily from this country in November, and we were expecting further orders later on.    Trade with Japan was still fairly good.MR. ARTHUR SHAW wrote&quot;The position in the wool textile trade is very unsatisfactory, due, probably, to the unsettled state of affairs in connection with the wages position.    To some extent the application for the Safeguarding of the Industry has also had the tendency to create an atmosphere of unrest, and this applies to all sections of the industry.    A quick decision on this subject will undoubtedly help to restore confidence.&quot;The feeling of optimism which prevailed towards the end of last year has been followed by a general state of depression.    It was fully expected that in the Bradford trade the Improvement which commenced during November would be maintained, but unfortunately, from our own unemployment figures, the position has shewn no signs of improvement during January.    In the heavy woollen district there has been a slight improvement, but here again there is considerable unrest in view of the fact that a number of employers have reduced wages by 10% without any arrangement through the Industrial Council or the representatives of the Trade Unions. In the Huddersfield district the position has been maintained, particularly in the suiting trade.    In view of the failure of the Industrial Council representatives to agree to a meeting to discuss the question of reducing wages in certain sections of the industry, a considerable period is certain to elapse before stability can possibly be restored.&quot;Having regard to the present  controversy in trade circles as to the quality of imports and exports,  I have
-  ii2 jextracted from the Trade Returns the values per square yard of the imports and exports, and some of the figures are very illuminating.    In particular, they clearly indicate that Germany imports the cheapest qualities into this country and takes from us the most expensive class of goods.&quot;TABLES SENT BY MR.

CHEMICALS.MR. HILL stated, that, iii spite of persistent reports that there had been depression during 1928, the demand for heavy chemicals was definitely greater than in 1927.   This had particular reference to home trade, where the expansion was appreciably due to the demand from the artificial silk industry.   The new plant set up by Imperial Chemical Industries for the synthetic production of methyl alcohol was now working extremely satisfactorily, and this product was now a British one.    It was the basis of a whole series of products, and it was satisfactory, to report that the labours of Imperial Chemical Industries had been entirely successful. Imperial Chemical Industries were also producing synthetic nitric acid in increasing quantities, and probably in the near future the entire home requirements of this acid would be covered by the synthetic product.The Distillers Company at Hull were producing, from alcohol, acetone,acetic acid and butyl alcohol.   These substances were at present entering the country in large quantities, but soon we might expect that the quantity imported would drop to an insignificant level.    It was expected that acetic acid, which was used In the artificial silk industry, would shortly be produced synthetically by Imperial Chemical industries.This Combine had, during January, made an appreciable reduction In the price of many of their most, important products, including dyestuffs.   This indicated a new sales policy aiming at the stimulation of consumption by low prices for dyes.At the last meeting &amp;r. Hill had reported on the statistics for the eleven months of 1928, aad he had now the figures for the whole 12 months, which showed that, taking chemical products generally and including not only the &quot;chemical&quot; group in the Trade Returns, but also such other products as raw artificial silk, pitch, fertilisers, soap, etc., the balance of exports over retained imports for the years 1926, 1927 and 1928 had been approximately  9,000,000  12,000,000 and  13,000,000 respectively.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON said that the general condition of the rubber manufacturing industry for the past month had not been quite so satisfactory as during the later months of last year.    In the tyre section there had been rather more than the usual seasonal slackness, and the supply seemed to be in excess of the demand. The rubber footwear branch, which had shown great activity towards the end of last year, had been unsatisfactory in January,    General rubber goods had been more or less normal, except that business to the Continent and the East had been under the average.    Employment had been at about the same level as in previous months.
RUBBER  (CONTD. ) .The prospects were quite fair.    A peculiar situation had arisen in the tyre trade by reason of the tremendously increased productive capacity in this country.    The manu-&apos; facturer did not expect to gain very much in the immediate future, but the British workmen would certainly gain enormously, because not only would the tyres which were previously imported into this country be made here, but a great many which were previously exported from America to Continental countries and the Dominions would be made here as well.    One had always been told that by restricting imports one would reduce exports, but in this case the duty which had been put on would increase exports.Llr. Johnston thought it might be of interest to review the effect of the removal of export restrictions on crude rubber on the rubber manufacturing industry in this country and abroad.    The decision of the Government entirely to remove the restrictions from the 1st November last was violently criticised, almost equally by the rubber growers and by the manufacturers.    He had no doubt the growers were still suffering under a sense of injury, although the situa-tion created would probably be to their eventual good.   As regards the manufacturers, however, it was only right to say that the prophecies of disaster had not been borne out by the event.    There was no doubt that, when the heavy fall in prices came, following on the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement, all the manufacturers found themselves with considerable stocks on hand, bought at higher prices and contracted for at higher prices also, but, owing to the very fact that all were more or less in the same situation, there was no really serious fall in the selling price of manufactured goods, and the eventual result was that most concerns had, after a period of considerable anxiety, got through most of their commitments without any serious loss.    This was due, he thought, very largely to the fact that not the slightest inkling of the Government&apos;s intention had been allowed to get out in advance. Though there was a good deal of &quot;inspired&quot; information at the time, thi3 turned out to be entirely wrong.It was also interesting to record that the British Government&apos;s action in ending restriction had been hailed in the United States as a very wise and statesmanlike step, though it was nevertheless the fact that it involved the American manufacturers in the loss of many millions of dollars.    He knew one concern had had to write down their stocks for the half-year by something like half-a-million dollars.    Another result would be an improvement in the cordiality of Anglo-American relations.    A very large percentage of the unfortunate anti-British feeling that now existed in the States, was due to the rubber restriction. Every motorist in America, and there were something like 25 millions of them, was informed that he had to pay a higher price for his tyres owing to the greed and monopolistic tendency of the British Government.    This feeling was against us as a nation and not as individuals, and the termination of the restrictions on rubber production might have some
RUBBER (CONTD. ).effect in removing it.   There would also be a gradual falling off in the use of reclaimed rubber, as rubber got cheaper.    In America they had very large reclaiming plants, which automatically went into or out of operation as the price of rubber went up or down.    In the finest grade of tyre reclaimed rubber could not be used, but there was a large proportion of second-grade tyres made in America in which reclaimed rubber was used when the price of new rubber went up.    For certain purposes, also, reclaimed rubber had to be used, owing to special physical qualities which It possessed.THE PRESIDENT observed that what Mr.Johnston had said was extremely Interesting as shewing the result of the Government&apos;s policy after there had been time for it to be appreciated.   The Government had been severely criticised for their action, and above all they had been criticised for its suddenness, which they were told was most disastrous, but which Mr,Johnston   now showed was the fairest and least disadvantageous course for the manu-facturer.GENERAL TRADE.LORD EBBISHAM, observed that on the Continent, Germany, France and Belgium were looking forward to a year of good trade, and the same applied to some South American countries and to the Far East,    In this country the general outlook was, on the whole, encouraging.   There might be nothing really to warrant any idea of sustained expansion at the moment, but we were hopeful.   The advantage of the business which came in towards the end of 1928 was being experienced now; and, whilst a very optimistic outlook would not be justified, an improvement seemed to be not unlikely.As to engineering and shipbuilding, although there had been a flow of orders, no substantial decrease in the volume of unemployment would probably follow at the moment. As regards textiles, there was some further hope for this country inasmuch as the trade unions in Japan were said to have made a very definite attack on female night-shift labour, and that now no more double shifts were being worked,   Thi3 ought to help our trade in that country owing to an Increase in the cost of production in Japan.As regards cotton, the uncertainty of the raw cotton market continued to have an unsettling effect upon the industry during January.   As a consequence trade had been generally disappointing.    Reports indicated that the month witnessed a slight increase in the volume of coarse yarn business for home and foreign markets, whilst yarns for use with artificial silk had been In steady demand.    In the
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).cloth section&apos;prices on the whole had been generally unremunerative.    Enquiries ircm the Far East, India, and South America had been rather better.Trade in the boot and shoe industry had been quieter last month as was usual at that time of the year.   Until the retail shops had disposed of outstanding stocks the manufacturers were not anticipating any substantial expansion in business so far as the home trade was con-concerned.    Export business continued to be steady with an expanding tendency.January had witnessed a steady improvement in trade in the chemical industry, both home and foreign trade being generally brighter.    Prices had been steady in most departments.    Business in the heavy section appeared to be particularly good, whilst trade in perfumery and essential oils, on the other hand, had been slow.   The New Year had also begun with rather more promise in the pottery trade, as demand on home account had been steadily expanding. Whilst the volume of trade which had been passing was considerably below the average for this season of the year, the outlook was more promising owing to the steady inflow of orders, and the fact that there was every indication that the recent inflow was likely to continue.MR. MITCHELL gave reports which he had received from the Chambers of Commerce.      In Hj.11 the seed crushing trade had been distinctly bad during December, with high prices for raw materials and poor demand and low prices for oil and cake,    In the paint trade, the home trade had been very, quiet and employment in the mills moderate with short time generally; the export trade had been a little better.    The timber trade had been quiet with a fair demand and the prioes steady.The Leicester report showed that business in the boot and shoe trade was quiet, though there was every prospect of an early Improvement.    Business was not so good as it was twelve months ago when stocks were being purchased against a rising market.    The trade was suffering mainly from depression in other industrial centres, but the indications of more activity in the heavy industries had produced a distinctly good feeling in the Leicester district.    The amount of unemployment and short time was greater than usual at this time of the year, but the figures were steadily declining.    In hosiery and knitted goods the general demand was slow and this was reflected in the hosiery dyeing and finishing trades.    The export trade in hosiery was good.   As regards lace, the conditions in Nottingham were at present quiet, but an improvement appeared probable in the coming season.    Generally speaking, the outlook was promising, and buyers and manu-facturers were looking forward to the future with optimism,
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)From Liverpool it was reported that the leather trade had not started the year well, and there continued to be shown a lack of confidence on the part of leather buyers and consumers at the present prices of the manufactured article. This was partly due to the fact that hides had fallen sharply in price here, on the Continent and In the United States.    The timber trade had been steady and there was some slow Improvement; prices remained firm and stocks were adequate.   The volume of work carried out by the ship-repairIng: establishments in Liverpool during the month of January showed some Improvement over December.Mr. Mitohell added that he wished to congratulate the Board of Trade on the new statistical tables illustrating the economic position, which had been published in the Board of Trade Journal, and a copy of which had been circulated to the Council.   He understood that they were to be printed monthly and he thought they would be of very great use to business men.THE -PRESIDENT said that they were, of course, the tables which had been prepared for the Council for some time, but which he thought were useful enough to deserve a wider circulation.   There had been appreciative references in the Press to their publication.LORD GAINFORO wrote:-&quot;The close of the year 1928 witnessed improvement in the principal staple industries, notably shipbuilding, Iron and steel, ooal mining and textiles.   The monetary situation is causing a good deal of anxiety, as it is becoming evident that the recent losses of gold have put a very heavy strain on the resources of the Bank of England.    Conditions abroad are, on the whole, favourable.    On the Continent, France and Belgium are looking forward to a year of good trade, and there are grounds for hoping that the recent reduotion in the Reichsbank&apos;s rate may bring to an end, at a relatively early date, the recession in trade from which Germany has recently been suffering.&quot;The reports from the Empire and the United States are uniforrnally good.    The same applies to certain South American countries, notably Argentine and Chile; in the Far East the re-establishment of Treaty relations with China has had a very beneficial effect, though it may be some time before this improvement is fully reflected in orders to British manufacturers.&quot;SIR GILBERT VYLE had recently had an opportunity of going round the country, and he found a much more cheerful tone everywhere.   Whether that was due mainly to the fact of the New Year or not, - looking forward to new times and getting rid
GENERAL TRADE  (CONTD. )of bad ones behind us - he did not know;   but there was undoubtedly still some confidence In the future.    The export trades generally seemed better, as did also the home trade, especially on the engineering side.Ratal 1 Trade.SIR WOOEMAN BUR BILGE wrote:-&quot;Business at the beginning of January in the retail distribution trades appears to have been generally disappointing, and the sales did not, to begin with, show the results anticipated.    As the month progressed, however, the situation improved, and there seems to be general unanimity that, for the departmental stores at any rate, the month turned out eventually to be a satisfactory one.    Reports so far received from the London stores show, without exception, an increase in the turnover compared with the corresponding month of last year, in some cases substantial, in others of an extent sufficient to deserve recording.    Similar reports from the North of England indicate a corresponding increase, with only one case of a shrinkage in trade, and it is probably safe to say in that area also the large retail stores have had a satisfactory turnover. In the South of England, increases in turnover definitely out-weigh cases of decrease, and the latter are not such as to affect unfavourably the general opinion that, apart from those areas specially hard hit by the distress in the coalfields, and its -consequent influence on the purchasing power of the population, retail trade was found ultimately to be more satisfactory than appeared to be likely at the beginning of the month.    There is no doubt that the unfavourahle Influences prevailing in the manu-facturing and merchandising branches of the textile trades have provided the larger retail distributors with good buying opportunities, and it is anticipated that on this ground satisfactory turnover has been obtained.    It is also understood that in some towns the fashion trade has been difficult, and low prices have been realised,    It is possible,  therefore, that the generally satisfactory turnover which is reported may have been secured at the sacrifice of net profits,&quot;T/ith regard, to employment,  the figures appear to show that there has been some increase in the numbers employed in January compared with the corresponding month last year, and although these increases may not he very substantial in extent, at any rate there is no falling off anywhere to report.    It is difficult to Indicate any decided, tendency in particular departments.    On the whole, there appears to have been a slight falling off in the sale of furniture and. carpets, though some increases in this direction are reported in London.    Sunderland also- reports disappointing sales  In the house furnishing departments.    In some cases dress materials are down-on the month, and similarly there has been a fairly general decline in the sale of Manchester and woollen dress goods,&quot;Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR, HAYHURST observed that he had been asked about the extent of the Empire trade which his Society were doing.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)Co-operative Wholesale Society.( Contd).During a period of six months their direct purchases from Empire countries had been in the neighbourhood of  7,000,000, whilst their actual sales of Empire produce during the same period reached the high figure of almost  16,000,000.    They were enhancing this trade as much as possible; and,  so far as New Zealand butter, cheese and meat were conoerned, they got last year  1,500,000 worth, of which they used  900,000 worth themselves.y       The Society had a fair report to give.    Their success was still continuing, except in one quarter, namely South Wales where success could hardly be hoped for at the present time.    The Society had had   to put up about  70,000 to rescue some of the Retail Societies there.MR. HAYHURST handed in a report to the following effect:-The month of January has provided us with trade of a very satisfactory character, and whilst there have been slight decreases in some sections, as compared with January, 1928, our aggregate sales compare very favourably v/ith twelve months ago.    Our total sales for the past half-year have also been satisfactory, an increase being recorded over the sales recorded for the corresponding half-year of 1927.    The production of goods in our various factories also shows an increase for the same period.   To me, this is particularly gratifying, in view of the unfortunate conditions which are at present prevailing in some parts of the country, and indicates the strength of, and confidence which the working class of the country have in, the Co-operative movement.    Our Bank Section also reports that business with them has been on the increase in every Department.Grocery and provisions.    During the past week or bo, moderate buying by England and the Continent of Danish butter caused dairies to lower their quotation, but towards the close of the month, a somewhat brisker market caused the quotation to remain unchanged.    Supplies of Australian and New Zealand are clearing practically on arrival, and values are being easily maintained.    Quantities afloat at the Immediate moment are much less than at this time last year. There has been a good enquiry for New Zealand cheese at present rates, whilst Canadian has been on the quiet side, with a market somewhat firm.    The sugar market has been on the quiet side for the past week or so, and London refined and home-grown granulated dropped in prices at the end of the month.    The wheat market closed quiot, but during the month showed advances up to l/- per quarter in various directions.    In the United States public speculation caused an advance.    Wheat stocks there, however, have been described as burdensome, tfith practically no export trade.    Canadian supplies to- the United States have been on the small side, prices ruling the position.    Australian offered has been good quality, but prices on the high side.    It is reported that Germany has been anxious to sell her wheat, but South Amerioan being better quality has hindered trade.    At the close of the month, stocks of corn in Liverpool were close
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.) .Co-operative Wholesale Society (Contd.).upon 20,000 quarters in excess of the previous week.    Average weekly consumption for the month, 4 2,400 charters.    Shipments from the Argentine last week in the month wore 248,500&quot; quarters, an increase of 64,000 quarters over the previous week.    There is an improvement of tone in the market for Continental bacon, especially in Danish, caused probably through delay in arrivals consequent upon severe conditions in Denmark.    A steady demand at the close of the month helped to keep the market firm.During January the tea market has been very irregular, owing to a falling off in quality, and larger offerings of common grades.    The revised figures from the Board of Trade, showing the position at the end of December, indicate a remarkable change during the past three months, and the position had undoubtedly moved in favour of sellers for some time past.    Both the home consumption and exports continued very good.    The auctions of coffee during the month have been heavy, and in particular the good grades of East A.african coffees commanded higher prices, the Costa coffees also showed a hardening up to 4/- per cwt., but taking the twelve months, these latter coffees have not realised the same prices as in 1927, and the Costa coffees, although a siT.aH part of the world1s supply, are the most popular for consumption in Britain.    The West African cocoa market, which is the basis of all cocoa prices, has continued to be very disturbed. Reports from the farmers on the West African Coast state that, because of low prices,   storage is taking place rather than sale of the raw beans.SHIPPING.MR.

WALKER suggested that there should be an extension of the scope of the Empire Marketing Board and that the Government should spend, for the next ten years, a million a year on advertising British goods in the Dominions,    He realised that, if times were normal, It would be for industry to find the money itself; it was certainly a trade matter, but at the present time it would be difficult for the trade of the country to find any such sum.    If the Government, however, could carry on such a scheme for ten years, then at the end of that time it should be made quite clear
EMPIRE MARKETING BOARD.   (CONTD. )to industry that it would have to find the money thereafter. He had suggested that the money should be spent in the Empire and not in the foreign countries, because of the increasing proportion of our export trade which was finding its market within the Empire.   A year or two ago a proposal had been made for lowering trade barriers throughout the world.    There were obvious difficulties to giving effect to this, and the only alternative was to endeavour to get the tariff barriers down within the Empire.THE PRESIDENT remarked that Mr. Walker had raised a very large Issue, and he would merely make two observations on it. The first was that the Government was endeavouring to reduce expenditure, and could not easily propose an extra expenditure of  1,000,000 a year for ten years.    Secondly, assuming the money could be found and that it was the business of the Government to carry out the scheme, it would be Impossible to do what had been suggested without agreement with the Dominions,   The Dominions had their own industries which they were trying to foster, and it would not be feasible to persuade them to abandon that course. It might be considered at an Imperial Conference whether the scope of the Empire Marketing Board could be enlarged with a view to making its activities more universal.   That would be a question which had an Imperial aspect, and might be worth discussing.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG reported to the following effect:-2,372,812 bales of wool were received into store between 1st July and 31st December, 1,209,084 were sold and 12,885 were shipped for sale overseas; the quantity available for sale in Australia during the six months ending 30th June next is 1,360,454 bales.    New South Wales has had plentiful rains in the north, but the south coast and the inland districts are still dry, and dairy production in these parts is decreasing, although production throughout the State is increasing.    In Victoria and Western Australia dairy production is declining, in Queensland it is increasing, and In Tasmania it is up to average. Shipment of wheat and flour since 1st December has been proceeding actively and in&quot; larger quantities than last year, and a heavy sugar crop is anticipated this season.The bank clearances for the year ended 31st December last were for Australia  2,297,846,000, being a decrease of  80,136,000 compared with 1927, due partly to heavy loan conversions in 1927:    from 1st to 28th January, 1929, for Sydney -  73,792,000 compared with  81,807,000 last year, for Melbourne -  58,607,000 compared with  54,259,000 last year.   During 1928 there was a strong demand for securities with marked preference for sound stocks and
AU ST italian TRADE (CONTD. ).resultant increase In prices.    Buying was strong, clue largely to funds derived from loan interest, of which  15,819,000 was distributed throughout Australia on Commonwealth Loans.    The Stock Jixehange market is still buoyant with a trend towards lower interest rates.COLONIAL TRADE.MR. VERNON stated that the value of the exports from Malaya showed a reduction in 19 28 over the previous year, which was entirely due to the lower price of. rubber.    There was al so a reduction in imports.    It was rather less, which he thought simply indicated a certain lag between the import and expert figures.    The import figures for this year would probably be a little lower still.    The general position with regard to rubber&apos; appeared -to have improved,  and the impression was that the hoarded stocks were less than had been anticipated.    The figures of exports were rather remarkable.    The total exports of rubber for 1928 were 404,000 tons, and the last two months of the year, which represented the period during which there was no restric-tion, accounted for 133.000 tons out of that quantity. The exports of rubber for January of this year were 52,000 tons.    On the whole the feeling in Malaya appeared to be optimistic as to the consequences of the removal of the restri actions.There had been a steady increase   in the output of tin and tin ore, which reached a total of over 60,000 tons in 1928.    There had been anticipations that the low price of tin would result in a lot of the smaller Chinese enter-prises in Malaya going out of business, but those anticipa-tions had not been realised.The total trade of the Gold Coast in 1927 reached a figure of  28,000,000 and of that cocoa accounted for  11,700,000,    There ?/as an increase In the quantity of cocoa exported in 1928, but the figures of value were not yet available.    The imports from the United Kingdom in 1927 were  8,000,000, and from the rest of the British Empire  1,500,000,    The imports from the Empire as a whole would be between 50 and 60 per cent, of the total imports of the Gold Coast.East Africa showed an increase In most of the principal items of export last year fibre, tea and coffee all showed increases, and the figure for cotton from Uganda - 136,000 bales was high in 1928.In Ceylon there was a rather substantial decrease in both exports and imports..    The reduction in the export figure was entirely due to the fall in the price of rubber and tea.    The total trade of Ceylon in 1927 reached  66,000,000.    In 1928 only the figures for eleven months were available, but on the basis of the eleven months the full year would show a decrease of something like  13,000,000.
MiCONFIDENTIAL.COLONIAL TRADE (GONTD.).THE PRESIDENT asked if Mr. Vernon could say anything about rubber production in the Dutch East Indies, where he understood there was a large sporadic production.MR. VERNON replied that the only information he had related to the period prior to the removal of the restriction.    Certainly up to that time there had been a steady inorease in production.    The export figures he had given for Malaya included a certain amount of rubber imported and re-exported, but that was comparatively small and hardly affected the total.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE referred to the woll-known policy of penetration-tion followed by the United States in South America, which was exemplified by the present visit of Mr. Hoover.   Whilst ostensibly making a diplomatic tour, he was actually making a very commercial tour, and this was characteristic&apos;of their general plan to blend commercial knowledge and diplomatic knowledge in their representatives.    In one or two places they had indeed made very special appointments with a view to pushing commerce even more than before.   The unpopularity of the United states in South America was, however, increasing from day to day.Argentine.    At the presont moment the crop situation was t he rad s t imp ore ant question.   The total of the crops, assessed at a much lower value this year than last, would be about equal to the total crops last year.    It was reasonably certain that there would be no lack of funds this year to finance the movement of grain crops.    Indeed the Argentine was in the embarrassing position of having a great deal too much capital..Chile.      In Chile money was now being raised internally Instead of abroad.   A further internal issue of 50,000,000 pesos in 7 per cent. Public Works Bonds was recently over-subscribed.   This Issue was made in connection with a Bpeoial programme of public works construction.    In addition, the Government had taken urgent steps to provide for the reconstruction of the areas damaged during the earthquake in December.Brazil.   There was a favourable balance of trade in the first eleven months of 1928, of  7.000,000, which must be regarded as low compared with  25,000,000 in 1924.    The commercial outlook in general continued uncertain and interest centred in the price of coffee.Peru.     Business activity in Peru was very slow.
TRADE,WITH RUSSIA.MR. HAYHURST, referring to the proposed delegation of British traders to Faissia, said that he had always been reluctant that his Society should do business with Russia, but it might be of interest to mention a few particulars of their trade with that country.    In connexion vith the &quot;tea department, the Co-operative Wholesale had put them up a credit of  400,000, and they had met their obligations every time, and in various lines they had dealt -vith Russia to an amount of  6,500,000 in trade and advances, and  5,900,000 had been repaid.    They had done an aggregate of trade with Russia in the last four years, both in advances and in reciprocity trade,  of  28,900,000; and  35,300,000 had been repaid.    He had no fault to find with them at all, on the point of repayments, and if these British firms  ?ho were sending the delegation across there could come to some equitable arrangement with the Russians, could     they get assistance under the Export Credits scheme, or could the Government help them in any way?    Russia had not the necessary money, credit would have to be given,  and other countries would strive to get the business for themselves.MR. HACKING explained that it had always been the policy of the successive Governments since the Export Credits scheme had first been started, not to extend the facilities to Russia,  in view of the attitude which had been, and -ras still being, adopted by the Government of that country.    Even in the event of Export Credit facilities being extended to Russia, each case would still have to be reviewed by the Department&apos;s Advisory Committee; and though perhaps some additions.l business might occasionally be done, the increase arising from Export Credits would probably not be anything considerable.    We were in favour of trade being done -.?ith Russia now, whenever our traders could satisfy themselves on the propositions presented to them, and we had said so frequently; but it was not to be expected that 3uch an extension of facilities would make very much difference.TRADE IN CHINA.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR remarked that the situation in China was very interesting.    There had been a meeting in Paris during the previous week of the International Chamber of Coiomerce with three Chinamen who had been sent over by the Association of Chambers of Commerce in China and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce,  to discuss the whole situation.      There had been a straightforward talk on all questions.    They had harped all the time on concessions and unequal treaty rights.    We had fought each point with then.    We also -.vent over&apos; the crhole question of loans. There was no doubt that the Chinese were going to face their loans.    They also seemed sanguine that they oould do away with &quot;likin&quot;.Thirty or forty prominent Chinamen were coming over in June for a preliminary conference, and they would then attend the big conference at Amsterdam in July.    They vj-would  all be very influential people, and we certainly
TuADE IN CHINA (CONTD.).ought to entertain then in this country before they /rent to Amsterdam.Sir A. balfour had had an opportunity of seeing one of hi3 agents from the interior of China.    Grave difficulties were occurring there which did not come up in discussions between us and the Chinese.    The Minister of Tar, who was very powerful, was to have charge of all the arsenals.    They were changing these arsenals over and calling them establishments for assisting the disbandment &quot;of soldiers. Ve had not at all done .vith armaments in the interior of China and the production of high explosives in the new plants which had been put up; and matters //ere not settled in the interior as the Nanking Government would like us to think.    On the other hand, there was no other Government to deal with, and no doubt we did well to meet them and recognise them, and ratify our Treaty.With regard to trade marks, our people would be -veil advised to re-register their trade marks at Nanking.    All the German firms, and most of the French firms had re-registered.
Reprinted from The board of Trade Journal, dated January 24th, 1929.UNITED KINGDOM.STATISTICAL TABLES ILLUSTRATING THE ECONOMIC POSITION.The Tables which appear on pages 121 and 122 are designed to show the trend of the economic position in the United Kingdom by setting out in a readily com-parable form, i.e., by means of monthly averages, a series of statistical data. It is intended to publish similar tables monthly in future.Table I. General, contains particulars relating to New Capital Issues, Bank Clearings, Transport (Kail-ways and Shipping), External Trade, Postal Receipts, Employment, the Board of Trade Index Number of Wholesale Prices and the Chamber of Shipping Index of Freights.Table II. Particular Trades, contains figures relat-ing to activity and employment in certain important industries for which information is available. Activity in the Coal Mining Industry is indicated by the quanti-ties of Saleable Coal raised and quantities exported, in Iron and Steel by the output of pig iron and of crude steel, and in Copper and Rubber by the quantities of those commodities available for consumption. In the Textile Trades figures are shown for the quantities of cotton delivered to mills, the production of artificial silk yarn and waste, the deliveries of natural silk for home consumption, and for the wool textile industry the index of wages paid as calculated by the Ministry of Labour. The Beama Index of Production has been shown for Electrical Engineering. The tonnage of merchant vessels under construction is shown for each quarter and the relative estimated cost of the dwelling houses and other buildings, the plans for which have been approved by Local Authorities.The percentages, printed in italics in the Tables, are based on the figures for 1924 taken as 100. It should be noted that, in the cases where an index has been originally calculated and published on a base year or period other than 1924 (as Table I., item 7, Chamber of Shipping Index; and Table II., item 4, Beama Index of Production) the monthly averages of the published index numbers for 1924 have, for the present purpose, been taken as 100, and the index numbers for 1927 and later periods have been calculated as percentages of the 1924 average.The particulars of Railway Freight Traffic (Table I., item 4), and of employment and unemployment relate to Great Britain only. The figures of insured workers in employment represent the numbers of workers insured against unemployment after deducting those registered as unemployed, and an estimate of the number absent from work owing to sickness, etc., and to trade disputes; the results are not necessarily of a high degree of accuracy.*   (302)479(4.10)   Wt 22400-3505   250   2/29   M &amp; S
