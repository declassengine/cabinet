MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.All the Members of the Committee save one are satisfied that it is to our interest to preserve what are known as high belligerent rights. A difference of opinion has arisen as to how these rights could best be preserved, whether by including them in our Arbitration Treaty with the United States or by excluding them. Those who favour inclusion argue that such a course would gratify American opinion and produce a good feeling in that country. They would add that the question of belligerent rights lay at the root of any difficulties or disputes that we had with the United States. It is common ground that it would be as well to avoid a Conference,, if possible, with the United States on the subject of belligerent rights.The inclusionists&apos; view is that quite possibly, in view of the good feeling produced by inclusion, and of the difficulties of such a Conference, Mr. Hoover might be anxious to avoid one altogether.   Further it is said that, if a Conference is called,, it would be easier for us to confine the reference of such a Conference to codification as opposed to amendment of the law.   Further it is suggested that if in a Conference so limited disagreement arose on any particular points such as convoy law, lists of contraband or other questions, it would be possible to break off the Conference without causing any profound injury to our relations with the United States because the latter would know that, though we could not agree on certain points, we had yet bound ourselves  to   submit   them   to   arbitration,   if  such  cases   should   arise in Avar and neutrals had cause to complain.   Now it is no doubt probable that inclusion would   gratify the Americans,   but whether  it  would  produce  any permanent alteration (which alone is valuable) in our relations is at least doubtful.   They would know perfectly well that we attached the greatest importance  to these belligerent rights, and   that, if  we agreed  to  arbitrate  on  them, it was  not so much from a  sense of  national   advantage as  in   deference  to their  great power and  wealth.    They   would  surely,   having  won  the   first  round of  the contest without difficulty, proceed to the second stage of defining in Conference what those justiciable rights were about which we were ready to arbitrate.   They/ would argue convincingly that it would be illogicalto agree to submit to arbitration certain questions as being justiciable, and yet to leave in a vague and unsettled condition the very rules of law which were to be applied in these cases.   Mr. Hoover would be hardly likely to put himself in opposition to a public opinion which would demand in the eager American fashion that the problem should be settled once for all and not left unfinished.   Again, with regard to our power of resisting amendment as opposed to codification, I submit that, having already agreed to arbitration, it would be more difficult for us to oppose the insistent American demand that we should not only declare what the law was, but should definitely alter it by agreement in order to ease the position of neutrals.   If our attitude stiffened we might again be told that this fresh sacrifice was necessary to placate American opinion, and that the retention of these rights in their present form was not worth the risk of incurring the ill-feeling or the hostility of the United States. .   Let it be remembered that other Powers besides ourselves might be invited to the Conference, and we might find ourselves in the position of having to stand against many other Powers whose interest would be to maintain the rights of warfare oh; land, but carefully to curtail them on the sea.   I fear then that we might be easily swept from our moorings in such a Conference.But let us suppose that we were able to limit the Conference to codification and that differences arose. 1 doubt whether American opinion would be pacified by the suggestion that no harm was done, even in case of difference, because we had agreed to go to arbitration if dispute arose iu a subsequent war. We should again be told, &quot;Why leave this matter open to another war? Let us settle it at once and retain the friendship of America.&quot;Any course in this matter is beset with: difficulty, but let us examine the case for exclusion. Let us not forget first of all that, according to the terms of the Treaty, these subjects of dispute should only be submitted to arbitration when diplomatic3455      75   2.29Printed for the Cabinet.

action lias failed -and when no agreement has been reached on the reference to conciliation under the Bryan Treaty. There is no sharp antithesis, therefore, between open war and arbitration. The Americans are, of course, very well aware of our difficulty about belligerent rights, and if, under general words, we do exclude them, Ave shall no doubt be challenged as to their meaning. We then can take two courses. We can say : &quot;In our particular situation as an island Power in a scattered Empire, we regard these rights as an essential form of self-defence. Moreover, the late war has shown that, if we had not exercised these rights, our fate might have been sealed.&quot; The United States have said themselves that they would not arbitrate on questions connected with the Monroe Doctrine because they regarded it as a matter of self-defence. If it is thought that it would be unwise to take our stand on such an uncompromising negative, we should point out the plain fact that these rights were not justiciable because there was no rule of law recognised by both parties which would apply. In that case, no doubt, it might be difficult to resist the suggestion that a conference should be called in order to define what those rights were. But, as I have said, in the case of exclusion the possibility of avoiding the conference seems very remote; therefore the practical difference in this respect between the two courses is really negligible.But when the question of a conference arose could we not urge that in this most vital matter we must thoroughly discuss the whole problem with our Dominions in council before we could assent to such an invitation? Surely it would be very unreasonable for the United States to dissent from our view, especially when it could not be pleaded that the imminence of war made delay dangerous. It is suggested that we might not get much support from our Dominions, even if we did summon them to a conference. But if the whole subject were very fully discussed with ihe representatives of the Dominions present, surely the results Avould be very different from what they would be if they were merely consulted by telegram without full opportunity of hearing the whole case. Nor would this conference be in any way mixed up with such questions as the interference of the Mother Country with the Dominions on questions of status or the full exercise of diplomatic rights ; it would affect the rights of the British Navy in a war which presumably would only be undertaken with the assent -of the Dominions, Avhile the penalties for the misuse of helligerent rights would be far more likely to fall upon Great Britain than upon themselves. The interest of the Dominions would not be likely to obscure the light of argument. It may be said that Canada, from her proximity to the United States, might be unAvilling to support our views against hers. On the other hand, Canada claims to know the United States far better than we do. She does not believe that the best Avay to obtain good results is by giving way too easiby to the United States requirements; indeed, the view is very generally expressed in Canada that one reason for her insistence upon diplomatic representation at Washington is that we had let her doAvn so often in diplomatic arrangements with the United States by our unnecessary complacence.However this may be, if we have ultimately to sacrifice our rights, would it not be better to do so after a full conference with the Dominions, Avhen it might be contended that we had yielded, not .so much to the insistence of America, as to the persuasions of our Dominions and.the friendly countries of the Empire?. Perhaps I may say a word as to the effect which Avould be produced on our own Party by the announcement that we had agreed to an all-in arbitration with the United States Avithout -accepting belligerent rights. Is there not anyhow a grave chance that many of our best supporters might be deeply disturbed by our action ? They Avould not be familiar with the nicely balanced arguments to which we have listened, nor would it be possible to state our case in public. We could not, of course, say that we had agreed to the inclusion of belligerent rights because we thought, on the one hand, that it might avoid a conference, and again that we might more easily confine that conference to codificatiou as opposed to amendment. I fear that consternation Avould be caused in the ranks of many Avho have not forgotten the controversy OA^er the Declaration of London. ii It has been suggested in the last few days that it would be wise to indicate to Mr. Hoover or his representatives that Ave might be prepared to review the whole question of our relations with the United States and to discuss arbitration, belligerent rights and naval construction on a comprehensive basis. It was feared that Mr. Hoover might- come to a decision about a conference without full appreciation of the difficulties, and that in view of his character, at.once impulsive and obstinate, it might be difficult to shake his resolution by subsequent argument.   If this course is
followed, it would be obviously unwise to concede the inclusion of belligerent rights in an Arbitration Treaty before the other questions at issue had been weighed and considered together. If Ave find, in the course of conversations, that we are not sharply divided from the United States on problems of maritime right, the question of inclusion or exclusion will lose much of its importance and much of its danger. If, on the other hand, we find that the differences between xis and the United States are deep and vital, we shall be in a much better position to judge whether or not it is-safe to allow all these questions to be included in an Arbitration Treaty. From a political point of view, if subsequently we agree to the all-in arbitration we should be able to explain to our supporters that we have done so because we were assured of a large measure of agreement with the United States. At any rate we should have avoided the public statement before the Election that we had committed ourselves to an all-inclusive treaty.I am not quite certain what it is that we fear if in case of difference we have resolutely to hold our ground against the United States. To take the extreme case, they can hardly go to war with us because we cannot agree with them on the action to be taken in a contingency that may never arise. If again, as would become clear in any conference, we are at one with them over a substantial number of points, it will surely be difficult for them to persxiade their countrymen that, nevertheless, they must add largely to the strength of their Navy. If the United States desire to have a superior Navy to us they can and they will build that Navy, quite irrespective of some particular agreement on belligerent rights, Could the Americans injure us in any other way, or would they desire to do so? Let me quote an observation made to me by the late Mr. Harvey, United States Ambassador in this country. He said to me, &quot; Well now we take a fresh interest in your country,&quot; and when I enquired his meaning he said, &quot; You are paying us 33 millions a year. In a few years you will be paying more. We are good business men and we are not goiug to quarrel with so nseful an asset.&quot;India Office, PEEL.11th February 1929.
