SECRET. - Copy No.     28CP. 18 (29).CABINET.CANADA AND THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN connection with the statement made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Cabinet on the 19th December last Avith regard to the possibility of the withdrawal of certain South American States from the League of Nations, I circulate to my colleagues a copy of a despatch from the High Commissioner for Great Britain in Canada on the subject of a speech by the Canadian Minister of Railways regarding the position of Canada in relation to the League.Dominions Office, S. W. 1, January 28, 1929.(No. 25.) High Commission for Great Britain,Sir, Ottawa, December 21, 1928.I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith press reports* on a speech made by the Hon. Charles Dunning, Canadian Minister of Railways, on the 19th instant, to the Canadian Club at Ottawa.2. The burden of Mr. Dunning&apos;s speech was that the League of Nations was pulling its weight; was slowly and by infinite courtesy building up a spirit of co-operation and goodwill among nations; and was of importance to Canada as well as to Great Britain, because, even if its political activities might seem to be largely concerned with Europe, no member of the British Commonwealth of Nations can remain unaffected by difficulties which affect another member of the group.3. Whereas the Prime-Minister in his speeches since his return from Geneva has tended to stress Canada&apos;s part and the role which she can play in conjunction with the United States in purging Europe of her &quot;war-mindedness,&apos;&apos; Mr. Dunning struck a more sympathetic note in thus reminding his audience of the common cause between Canada and the rest of the Empire.4. Although nothing very startling or very new was said during the course of Mr. Dunning&apos;s recital of his experiences at Geneva, there was a sincerity and conviction about his remarks which had an excellent effect upon the audience. It must be remembered that the average business man in Canada is apt to think that the League of Nations may be good for Europe but is not necessary for Canada, or to doubt whether the League of Nations is making any progress, or having any real influence upon the &quot; war-mindedness &quot; of Europe, of which they have remained firmly convinced. Mr. Dunning&apos;s remarks will, therefore,&apos;have served a very useful purpose; and, as the speech was also broadcast, it is to be hoped that its effect will not be lost upon Canadian public opinion, which has a high regard for him.I have, &amp;c.W. H. CLARK.The Right Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P.,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.[18796]* Not printed.Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1929.
