Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1929.SECRET.CP. 10 (29).CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education.LORD SALISBURY rightly asked members of the Cabinet, at a recent meeting, to refrain from forming any final conclusions on this subject pending the reports of the Committees which are considering Disarmament, and Belligerent Rights.* I have, however, so strong a feeling that the solution of our present difficulties is to be sought in one direction and in one direction only, that I venture to put my provisional views on paper.I begin with the draft Arbitration Treaty. The American draft is the natural outcome of the internal conflict which has been going on in American politics ever since American statesmen first concerned themselves with the question of international arbitration. Americans, brought up in the worship of the American federal constitution as the greatest effort of human political invention, have instinctively assumed that international peace could best be assured by a process of judicial &quot; construction &quot; on the analogy of the Supreme Court of the United States. On the other hand, whenever they have been confronted with a proposal of this kind, from the days of the Olney-Pauncefote Treaty onwards, their strong practical sense has shied away from it as involving too dangerous a sacrifice of American rights. The compromise embodied in the present draft Arbitration Treaty, i.e., the reservation of the Monroe doctrine, is perhaps not quite so opportunist as it appears at first sight. Americans can point out that the Constitution of the United States has specifically reserved from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court certain &quot;justiciable &quot; disputes to which a State is a party, and they can argue that similar reservations are not unreasonable in the sphere of international arbitration. Indeed, this particular reservation is made in the Covenant of the League itself. Our trouble is, not that, we object to reservations in principle, but that we find peculiar difficulty in formulating our own.It has been said that this difficulty would disappear, and, indeed, that any reservation by us would become unnecessary, if we could reach an agreement with the United States and with other Nations for the codification of belligerent rights at sea. But is this so ? In these days of rapid scientific development the conditions under which war is carried on may alter from decade to decade, and it is notoriously difficult to foresee, only a. few years in advance, the measures which a belligerent may have to take. To take our own experience, if belligerent rights had been codified entirely to our own satisfaction at the time of the Declaration of London, would that code have sanctioned the method of rationing neutral nations by the standard of normal imports without which our naval action against Germany would have been wholly ineffective ? And if the code had been silent on that point, could we for one moment have contemplated submitting the legality of our rationing system to an international tribunal ?If there be any force in this contention, it would appear that we must in some form protect ourselves against the risk of being forced to submit the exercise of our belligerent rights to arbitration. ; But need this precaution be taken in respect of the exercise of our belligerent rights in all ivars ?. The full exercise of such rights is only of the first importance to us in those wars, which have hitherto occurred only once a century, when we are fighting for our life. In other wars our only vital interest is to avoid a judgment against us by an.international prize court which, as a* Reference : Cabinet 56 (28), Conclusion 2.[18753]Copy No.28
precedent, might tie our hands in some future world war. If it were possible to distinguish certain wars as a separate legal category, to which the ordinary doctrines of international law would not apply, or would apply only in a modified degree, we might without serious danger accept something in the nature of an international prize court in other wars.   Is such a distinction possible ?From the point of view of principle, such a distinction is surely not only possible, but absolutely necessary. I have referred to the constitutional tradition which underlies the American attitude towards international arbitration, because that tradition offers us an opportunity to meet Americans on their own ground with an argument which is not unlikely to appeal to them. There is, in fact, a subtle fallacy in the American attempt to substitute &quot; justiciability &quot; for &quot; vital interests &quot; as the sole criterion (subject to specific reservations) whether an international dispute should or should not be submitted to judicial arbitration. While appearing to proceed on the analogy of domestic law, it ignores the existence of a serious gap in international law as compared with domestic law the fact that international law-does not admit a plea of self-defence in mitigation of an otherwise unlawful act. This statement may be a little too sweeping, but it is, at any rate, true that the origin of a war is not relevant to the consideration of the lawfulness of a belligerent act. Grotius and his immediate successors did attempt to evolve a doctrine of &quot;just&quot; and &apos;&apos; unjust&apos;&apos; wars, but later publicists have relegated these attempts to the domain of morals and theology, and in doing so they have really made it impossible for an &quot;innocent&quot; belligerent willingly to submit to the judgment of an international tribunal the measures which it may be forced to take in self-defence against unprovoked aggression.It is admittedly difficult to define self-defence, and it is probably undesirable to attempt to do so; but in the absence of a definition, the necessity for reserving &quot; vital interests &quot; can only be got rid of in one of two ways. The first is to give the State so absolute a guarantee of protection against aggression that it will be unnecessary to consider what it might have a right to do if it were acting alone in self-defence. This is, in effect, the position of Massachusetts or Oklahoma vis-a-vis the Federal Government and the Supreme Court; and the Covenant of the League of Nations contains an attempt to give members of the League some sort of guarantee of pro-tec tion on these lines. But the United States has rejected this solution, and, in any case, the guarantee cannot, under present conditions, be made nearly absolute enough to provide a satisfactory solution. The only other alternative is to recognise the distinction between wars of self-defence and aggression, without attempting to define it, and, in lieu of any guarantee of protection, to admit the right of an attacked State to adopt measures necessary to its defence which in other circum-stances might be unlawful, even if such measures affect the rights of third parties.I believe a proposal to deal with the &apos;&apos; freedom of the seas&apos;&apos; on these lines was made by President Wilson to Mr. Lloyd George at Paris in 1919. Whether the United States would now consider such a proposal may be doubtful; but, at any rate, the &quot; Kellogg Pact &quot; has taken the first step by putting &quot; war as an instrument of national policy &quot; in a category by itself. Now that international law has created this category, international lawyers cannot escape the duty of considering how the category is to be treated. At present it may be assumed that American opinion is prepared to go as far as to &quot; outlaw&quot; a belligerent who breaks the Pact, in the restricted sense that any law-abiding person may cut the outlaw&apos;s throat, but is not prepared to undertake any obligation either to join in a hue and cry against him, or even to refrain from giving him aid and comfort. This position w7e must accept for the time being. The question remains whether the law-abiding person is to be regarded as so far performing a public service that he may be allowed a free hand in picketing the outlaw&apos;s house and intercepting his supplies if he has the power to do so.  Is there any chance of inducing the United States to accept such a doctrine 1Clearly it will not be easy, for if there ever was a war against an outlaw it was the late war, and it is precisely our belligerent action in that war which has aroused American apprehensions. On the other hand, a proposal on these lines would at least be more attractive to Americans than a proposal that they should accept our practice in the late war as the standard of belligerent rights in all future wars. This brings us to the question what attitude we should adopt towards the proposal for a codification of the laws of war at sea.The alternatives hitherto suggested have been that we should either pursue our traditional policy of putting belligerent rights at the highest and attempt to win over the United States to that point of view, or that we should abandon our
traditional policy and aim mainly at securing ourselves against the risk of an interruption of our food supplies.   I have already indicated what appear to me to . be the two main objections to the first alternative.    The American Senate could . hardly be expected to ratify an agreement solemnly sanctioning for all future wars.., the very practices under which they smarted during the late war, and even if they could, their recognition of our past practices would not imply a recognition of the practices to which we may have to resort in future wars.   I have never been able to see how we could entertain the slightest hope of the success of a conference on belligerent rights conducted on these lines.The other alternative is open to an even graver objection. The country which stands to gain least from any restriction of belligerent rights on the lines of what are usually known as the &quot;Continental&quot; doctrine is the country which is geographically most exposed to a blockade in the strict and restricted sense of that word, and which carries the greatest proportion of its trade in its own bottoms. No restriction of belligerent rights on the basis of any existing doctrine of inter-national law is likely to give immunity from capture to the merchant marine of a belligerent or to withdraw from a belligerent the right to declare a naval blockade of enemy ports. We are the only country in the world which cannot depend for its supplies on neutral bottoms, and the British Empire contains the only countries in the world, except Japan, a blockade of whose ports means a blockade of their whole frontier. Even if this summary statement is a little too sweeping, it is surely true that all we could hope for from the adoption of the Continental doctrines as to belligerent rights would be to gather a few crumbs from the feast of immunities which would be spread before Continental nations.The fact is that the whole idea of a codification of the existing laws of war at sea is too conservative. A conference on this basis could only involve us in the vicious circle of old controversies charged with bitter memories. If we are to deal with belligerent rights by international agreement, our only possible course is to lift the whole question on to a new plane altogether, and to propose, not a codification of past practice or past doctrines, but a piece of new international legislation.My tentative suggestion is that we should propose an agreement embodying nothing less than the &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; in its most extreme form, the complete immunity of all ships and cargoes on the high seas, the abolition of the doctrines of contraband and blockade, and the restriction of the right of capture to enemy Government property seized in belligerent territorial waters. The agreement would, however, provide that, in the event of a war arising out of a violation of the Kellogg Pact by one of its signatories, the other belligerents involved in such a war should have the exceptional right of declaring a blockade of the territory of the violating State, this right of blockade to be defined in new terms and to include the full doctrine of continuous voyage.The most obvious objection to this proposal is that our apparent renunciation of belligerent rights would be regarded by Americans as a mere fiction, because in all wars there must be an aggressor, who, by his aggression, will have violated the Kellogg Pact. But is this so? It is, indeed, difficult for us to conceive ourselves &quot;being involved in hostilities which did not arise out of the use by some other nation of war as an instrument of national policy but it is not at all difficult for Americans to do so. As we can see from the recent debates in the Senate, Americans have a vague idea of a British Empire ringed by debatable lands where war may at any moment flicker up without it being possible to say that either party is the wilful aggressor. They suppose that our &quot; reservations &quot; to the Kellogg Pact were intended to cover such wars; they perhaps think of the South African war and the Egyptian expeditions, and ask whether similar conflicts are not likely to arise out of our new responsibilities in Palestine and Iraq. They might find it difficult to imagine a concrete case in the future where such a conflict could interfere materially with American trade, but their fears are none the less real for being vague.The readiness of the United States to regard proposals on these lines as a substantial advance on the present position will probably depend very largely on how far we are prepared to accept arbitration as the method of determining the legality of a declaration of blockade, and of any acts done in pursuance of such a declaration. Here we encounter a serious difficulty. Even supposing that an agree-ment on belligerent rights were to give us so absolute a right to cut off all supplies, direct or indirect, from a State Avhich violated the Kellogg Pact, that we should not need to fear the results of an arbitration on any particular measure we might take to enforce a blockade, there would still remain the question whether the war was a
traditional policy and aim mainly at securing ourselves against the risk of an interruption of our food supplies. I have already indicated what appear to me to be the two main objections to the first alternative. The American Senate could hardly be expected to ratify an agreement solemnly sanctioning for all future wars the very practices under which they smarted during the late war, and.even if they: could, their recognition of our past practices would not imply a recognition of the practices to which we may have to resort in future wars.

Here we encounter a serious difficulty. Even supposing that an agree-ment on belligerent rights were to give us so absolute a right to cut off all supplies, direct or indirect, from a State which violated the Kellogg Pact, that we should not need to.fear the results of an arbitration on any particular measure we might take to enforce a blockade, there would still remain the question whether the war was a
war in which a blockade could be declared&quot; at all. This would turn on the issue whether a particular State had or had not violated the Kellogg Pact, and this issue could not be determined without a consideration of the merits of the dispute out of which the war had arisen., , The; only ,way to deal with this difficulty seems to be to adopt the principle that a belligerent need not submit his belligerent acts to arbitration if he is prepared to submit to arbitration the causes of the war itself; but he is bound to do one or the other. If Great Britain declares a blockade of Ruritania, and the United States demands arbitration on the legality of that blockade, Great Britain can either accept that demand or can submit to the United States for transmission to Ruritania a demand for arbitration of the dispute out of which the war has arisen. It would then become the duty, of the United States to exercise her good offices to induce Ruritania to accept this demand, and if Ruritania were to refuse it she should if so facto be regarded as a State which had violated the Kellogg Pact.At first sight this may seem a startling proposal, but if - we consider what steps under the Covenant must have preceded the outbreak of any first-class war in which we could be engaged, we shall probably conclude that we could run no serious risk in accepting an obligation of this kind. It would, of course, be far preferable that the United States should accept a unanimous decision by the Council of the League cif Nations prior to the outbreak of the war as settling the merits of the issues in dispute and rendering further arbitration unnecessary, but they will probably not be prepared to go so far as this at present, and we need hardly fear that a decision by the League would be materially varied by any subsequent arbitration.It would clearly be convenient that any agreement on these lines should be embodied in the treaty on belligerent rights itself, and we could then accept the draft arbitration treaty as it stands, without reservation.On the whole I believe there is a good chance that proposals on these lines would be received by the Government of the United States as at least a useful basis for discussion, and I. do not see how we can devise a more acceptable basis without a dangerous sacrifice of our security. If this be so, it is clearly desirable that we should sound the United States GovernEtient as soon as the new Administration comes into office, in order to forestall airy proposal for a mere codification of the existing laws of war at sea.I may add a word on the third matter in dispute between us and the United States the question of the limitation of naval armaments. If a permanent solution of this question must await an agreement on the question of belligerent rights, as I think it must, our object at the present moment should be to reach a practical modus vivendi for the time being.. The best modus vivendi would be that suggested by Mr. Lippman recently to Sir Esme Howard, i.e., a mutual agreement between ourselves and the United States not to exceed our existing programmes of naval con-struction. If, however, this proposal is to be put forward, it must be put forward by the United States. It would be fatal for us to take the initiative of making any proposal for limitation by programmes, partly because the Big Navy Party in the United States would immediately accuse us of trying to burke the question of parity, and partly because American opinion is traditionally suspicious of proposals by foreign Powers directly limiting the right of Congress to legislate. Our best course, therefore, would be to approach the new Administration privately before the next meeting of the Preparatory Commission with a view to arranging, if possible, that a proposal on these lines should come from the United States Government.E.
