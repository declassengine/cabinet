Paper No. 129-A.)Summary of Previous Proceedings.(Prepared by the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.)1. AS the question of the Channel Tunnel has been under frequent and close examination for over fifty years, it is thought that a summary of the results of previous enquiries may be of value to the Committee of Imperial Defence at the present time.Early History of the Channel Tunnel Scheme.2. As regards the historical aspects of the project, it appears that the proposal for a Channel Tunnel is over one hundred and twenty years old. In 1802 a French mining engineer, M. Mathieu, presented to Napoleon a scheme for a submarine tunnel, which was supported by Charles James Fox. A similar proposal by M. Thome de Gamond in 1859 for a tunnel from Eastware Bay to Cap Grisnez was approved by Brunei, Locke and Robert Stephenson. Tunnels were also suggested by J. F. Smith, in 1861, and later by Thomas Payne and others. The idea was again prominently brought forward in 1867, when a definite scheme was laid before the Emperor of the French by an Anglo-French Committee. In 1870 the French Government enquired whether the British Government would support the scheme, and in 1872 the Foreign Office, on the advice of the Board of Trade, informed our Ambassador in Paris that, while opposed to the establishment of any monopoly, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be well satisfied to hear that the British and French railway systems were likely to be connected by means of a tunnel. In 1874 a French Committee having reported in favour of the granting of a contingent concession, Her majesty&apos;s Government stated that they had no objection to the scheme, and acquiesced generally in the French Committee&apos;s report. In 1875 Bills facilitating preliminary operation were passed by the British and French Legislatures. On the 2nd August, 1880, as no arrangement had been come to with an authorized British company, the concession granted to the French promoters lapsed, and an extension of three years was applied for. In the same year the South-Eastern Railway Company brought out a rival scheme to that of the original Channel Tunnel Company, and proceeded to make experiments by sinking shafts between Folkestone and Dover.3. At.this stage military objections were raised, and an Inter-Departmental committee, representing the Admiralty, War Office, and Board of Trade, was appointed to consider the military aspects of the question. The War Office repre-sentatives, Sir Garnet Wolseley and Sir John Adye, differed in their views, and the committee reported that it was desirable to take further military and naval evidence Accordingly, on the 23rd February, 1882, the Secretary of State for War appointed [18755] 7
-a Special Committee, consisting of six military officers and three civilians, to con-sider the practicability of closing the submarine tunnel in the event of war. On the 17th May of the same year this Committee made various proposals for closing the tunnel, but concluded their report with the statement: &apos;&quot; That even the most comprehensive and complete arrangements which can be devised could not be relied upon in every contingency.&quot;4. On the 17th April, 1883, the general question as to whether sanction should be given to the Tunnel project was referred to a Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament, presided over by Lord Lansdowne. The Committee could not agree upon a form of report, but the majority considered Parliamentary sanction should not be given. The Select Committee had before them a memorandum by Sir Garnet Wolseley, dated the 16th June, 1882, which had originally been communicated to the Departmental Committee referred to above and appointed on the 22nd August, 1881, and which had also been submitted to the Scientific Committee assembled on the 27th February, 1882, to decide upon the best means that could be provided to ensure the destruction of a tunnel under the English Channel; supposing permission were granted for such an undertaking. This memorandum presented an exhaustive review of the whole question, and in it Sir Garnet Wolseley stated that the report of the Scientific Committee had greatly strengthened his conviction that the hour when the Tunnel is sanctioned will be for England a most disastrous one. (Sir Garnet Wolseley&apos;s report was reprinted as C.I.D. Paper 61-^4.) In consequence of this opinion, Government opposition to the Tunnel was consistently offered, and successive Bills or motions introduced in 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892, 1893 and 1894 were either defeated or withdrawn. The last division was taken on the 5th June, 1890, when the Bill was rejected by 234 votes to 153. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George and Lord Morley, who supported the Bill on that occasion, were all subsequently associated with the rejection of the project by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1907 and (with the exception of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who had died in 1908) again in July 1914.Lord Wolseley&apos;s Objections.5. Lord Wolseley&apos;s objections to the Channel Tunnel project exercised so far-reaching an influence that they are worth referring to. His Memorandum, which deals with every aspect of the question in great detail, takes up 23 pages of foolscap print (C.I.D. Paper 61-A), but he precedes it with his own summary, which is as follows : &quot;Summary of Objections to the Channel Project.&apos;&apos; That by the construction of a tunnel between England and France you destroy the great defence of the country, upon which we have hitherto entirely depended; that is, you destroy the value of the Channel. You completely put out of action the use of the fleet, which has always been hitherto our first line of defence. You join us on to the continent, and we must, in my opinion, when so joined on to the continent, sooner or la,ter, if we wish to remain an independent people, become like the continental nations a military Power. Although a soldier, I should be very sorry indeed to see this country bowed down beneath the weight of the burdens which all continental nations at present suffer from owing to universal military service, and also from the , enormous expense attendant upon those great standing armies which they keep up. As regards the direct danger which I dread, it is this, that, were the Tunnel once constructed, you would have between England and France a line of communication which, speaking in a military sense, is the most indestructible in the world, for, whatever line of communication you establish between your base of operations and your army in the front, in any campaign or in any possible country, that line of communication, when above ground, is liable to be attacked. It has to be protected by large forces on its flanks, often by great armies; but this Tunnel bored down beneath the sea can neither be touched by an army nor by a navy unless you destroy it before war actually comes upon you, which I think would be a very unlikely event. Looking to the nature of our laws, and our customs, and our entire unpreparedness for war, and the&apos; instinct which underlies all our feelings in England against war,
which prompts us to believe that war is almost an impossibility, I do not believe that we should ever be so prepared beforehand for an emergency as to have the Tunnel destroyed in time to ward off the danger which I foresee. That danger is briefly this, that the French, or whoever for the time being held the Calais end of the Tunnel, could by a coup d&apos;e main seize our end of it, and the very moment they had done so, Dover would become a tete du pont for their army, from which they could issue forth with any large army they chose to bring through the Tunnel. In other words, from that moment we should cease to be an independent Power, as we havetno army in England, nor could we raise an army that would have the slightest possible chance, under any circumstances whatever, short of the direct interposition of God Almighty, of enabling us to withstand a French army of the character that would tie poured into &quot;the country. As regards the seizing of the Tunnel by a coup de main, it is, in my opinion, a very simple operation, provided it be done without any previous warning or intimation whatever by those who wish to invade the country.&quot; (C.I.D. Paper 61-A.)The Enquiry in 1906-7.6. The next attempt to induce His Majesty&apos;s Government to give its consent to the Channel Tunnel Company to resume work was made in 1906, when a new Channel Tunnel Bill was introduced, and, early in the following year, was referred by the Prime Minister to the Committee of Imperial Defence. The question was accordingly reviewed for the first time by that Committee at their 96th Meeting, held on the 28th February, 1907, when the strategic aspects of the project were discussed. The Board of Trade furnished to the Committee a memorandum (C.I.D. Paper 40-A) dealing with the economic aspects. The Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence (Sir George Clarke, now Lord Sydenham) circulated a Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper 37-A) in support of the proposal. The views of the Admiralty are contained in a Memorandum dated January 1907 (C.I.D Paper 68-A), the last six paragraphs of which are here reproduced : &apos;c 14. From the point of view of the defence of the shores of Great Britain, both naval and military, it would appear that the construction of the Tunnel would add to our responsibilities and would swell the estimates for the defensive forces of this country, while it would introduce, without a doubt, a possible source of danger from raid, invasion, or treachery.15. As a set-off to this, we have only increased facilities for inter-communication with the continent, and for the transit of goods and passengers.16. The possible gain under these headings is not an equivalent compensa-tion for the risk we should run by giving up the advantages of the sea frontier we now possess and creating a means of approach by land to our shores, thereby bringing upon ourselves to some extent the obligations inseparable from a land frontier obligations from which we are at present free.17. The defence of the Channel and the securing of the United Kingdom from invasion is, and has been for centuries, the task of the navy. If the Channel Tunnel should be made, the navy can no longer be held responsible for this task; the responsibility will be divided, but the navy could not on that account be reduced in the smallest degree.18. The construction of the Tunnel would, therefore, involve divided responsibility, increased danger, and diminished security.19. &quot;When the above are weighed in the balance against possible commercial gain, in the opinion of the Admiralty the balance is altogether in favour of non-interference with the natural sea frontier, which has been one of the main factors in the creation and maintenance of the British Empire.&quot;The detailed views of. the General Staff were not placed on record on this occasion, but it is clear from the conclusion quoted below that they were of an adverse nature.7. The subject was discussed at the 96th Meeting, of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 28th February, 1907, the Minutes of which were as follows: &apos;&apos; The Prime Minister (Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) considered that our general policy with reference to the Tunnel should be based on the decisions as to its naval and military aspects.   He understood that both the Admiralty and the General Staff were opposed to the construction of the Tunnel.   The . economic side of the question was not a matter for discussion by the Committee.&quot; [18755] b 2
Conclusion.&apos;&apos; The Committee note that the Admiralty and the General Staff are opposed to the construction of the Tunnel.&quot;8. The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government was communicated to both Houses of Parliament on the 21st.March, 1907, when the following statement was made in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister (Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) : &apos;&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government fully recognise the deep concern felt in this matter, and have no other desire than to take the House fully into their confidence, even in anticipation of the early stages of the Bill. Briefly, I may say that our view of the public interest leads us to be opposed to this project of a tunnel. Even supposing the military dangers involved were to be amply guarded against, there would exist throughout the country a feeling of insecurity which might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and military, and a continual risk of unrest and possibly alarm, which, however unfounded, would be most injurious in its effect, whether political or commercial. On the other hand, there has not been disclosed any such prospect of advantage to the trade and industries of the country as would compensate for those evils. As to the personal convenience of passengers and the transit of light articles, it seems well&apos;that further consideration should be given to other means of conveyance, such as are used in the ferries across great channels of the sea in other parts of the world. These considerations lead us, while rejoicing in anything that facilitates the communication with our neighbours, to view this project with disfavour.&quot;Mr. Balfour, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, expressed &quot;great satisfac-tion at the declaration of policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government have just made.&quot;The Enquiry in 1914.9. On the 5th August, 1913, a deputation, representing a committee of members of the House of Commons in favour of the construction of the Channel Tunnel, submitted to the Prime Minister a memorial on the subject, and in October of the same year the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith) directed the Committee of Imperial Defence to reconsider the strategical aspects of the Tunnel.10. The question was discussed by the Committee at three meetings the 125th (the 3rd March, 1914), the 126th (the 14th May, 1914) and the 128th (the 14th July, 1914). The proceedings of the Committee on these occasions reveal considerable differences of opinion.11. Thus, the Admiralty began by circulating the following note, dated the 27th February, 1914, signed by Sir Henry Jackson, the Chief of the Staff: &quot;The Admiralty consider it indispensable that a Channel Tunnel should be capable of being flooded or otherwise effectually cut at any time by the Navy through the gunfire or other action of warships without military assistance, even though both ends of the Tunnel are in the hands of the enemy. It is for the promoters of the scheme and their engineers to satisfy this vital condition. If they are able to do so, the project offers various important strategic advantages, including a greater assurance for our food supply. If they cannot do so, the Admiralty would be compelled to oppose the scheme.&quot;12. A few weeks later the Admiralty recirculated their Memorandum of January 1907 (see above, paragraph 6), but with a covering note to the effect that they still adhered to the note quoted above in paragraph 11. Later on, the First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill) circulated a note elaborating the idea that the Tunnel should be capable of destruction from the sea, suggesting that it should be brought to the surface of the ocean not less than a quarter of a mile from the shore, and that the railway should run from the Tunnel-mouth to the shore on a bridge. There were further precautions, such as running the line along the coast for some distance, fitting it with drawbridges, flooding arrangements, &amp;c. (As will appear later  (paragraph 23), these proposals, which conditioned the
Admiralty support to the project for the Tunnel in 1914, were objected to by the Home Ports Defence Committee after the war-in 1920.)13.   The General  Staff  were opposed to  the  scheme  for  the  following reasons: &quot; The construction of a Tunnel between England and France will add something to the cost and will add much to the anxiety of the military and naval authorities who are responsible for the defence of this country.The disadvantages, serious as they are, may be outweighed by the fact of the increased facilities gained by the transport of our troops and stores to the continent of Europe, if His Majesty&apos;s Government had such an operation in view.In short, from a purely military point of view, if our troops are to become engaged in a European war fighting alongside the French, the more tunnels we possess between this country and France the better; if, on the other hand, no such operations are in contemplation, then we shall be far better off without any Tunnel at all.As Colonel Seely said at the 125th meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 3rd March, 1914, &apos; only if it could be assumed that the two countries (England and France) were on such intimate terms that in the event of war they could be regarded as one nation would there be a sound reason for making the Tunnel.&apos;On the other hand, even if we assume that these conditions now prevail, there is, of course, no certainty as to how long they may continue to prevail. The question is, therefore, ought we to saddle ourselves permanently with the increased military responsibilities and anxieties involved by the construction of a Tunnel merely for the sake of the advantage to be derived from one set of conditions alone, which, in the nature of things, is liable to undergo a complete change at any moment?In the opinion of the General Staff the answer is in the negative.&quot; (C.I.D. Paper 69-A.)14. Sir John French,* however, did not agree with the General Staff. His view is stated briefly in the following extract from a Memorandum which he circulated at the time: &quot;6. To put the matter briefly: I hold that the Straits of Dover, regarded as a military obstacle to the invasion of this country, will in the not far-distant future altogether lose their maritime character, and the problem of their successful passage by an invading force will present features somewhat resembling those involving the attack and defence of great river lines or operations on the great lakes in a war between Canada and the United States.The main object to be attained in trying to secure the passage of a great river line is to gain possession of the opposite bank and establish a strong bridge-head.In accordance with the views enunciated in this paper, I apply the same principle to the Straits of Dover, and hold that the only reliable defence against a powerful attack by hostile aircraft and submarines in vastly superior numbers is to possess a strong bridge-head on the French coast with an effective means of passing and repassing across the Straits, which would only be secured by the projected Channel Tunnel.&quot;   (C.I.D. 77-A.)15. Lord Kitchener was opposed to the scheme. He strongly objected to any tunnel unless it could be shown that its construction was vital to the country. He thought that if it could be proved that in time of war the Tunnel offered a safe avenue for the supplies of food and raw material, and that these supplies could be brought through French, ports and over French railways to the Tunnel, then the project might be one to consider; but he regarded it as unthinkable that any private company, for its own ends, should be allowed to embark on an enterprise which in any way endangered the position of this country. In his view, it would put us in the position of a continental nation with a land frontier, and we should he faced with all the disadvantages which land frontiers entailed.   He felt that* It has been stated recently in a letter to the &quot; Times &quot; that Lord French revised his view as a result of his experience in the war (see Appendix III).
the Tunnel would have to be totally destroyed if destroyed at all, because any partial destruction could be repaired. He envisaged conditions obtaining forty years hence, when many developments might have taken place in naval warfare, and the command of the sea might depend upon other means than battleships.16. The Board of Trade examined the question at great length, and arrived at conclusions rather adverse to the Tunnel (C.I.D. Paper No: 64-A). They thought that the construction of a Channel Tunnel &quot; would probably have but little effect on the foreign trade of this country. Indeed the question of passenger traffic is alone important, and by it the Tunnelscheme as a commercial enterprise must stand or fall.....    Whilst thepossibility of reaching this country without incurring the discomforts of the Channel crossing would no doubt attract a number of foreign visitors who do not now cross the Channel, it is to be remembered that the route thus provided would afford only an expensive mode of travel, and it would still leave this country and Prance separated by 30 miles of tunnel. For passengers the saving of time involved Avould be small, though business men would find it convenient to accomplish the journey between London and Paris by night without interruption.&quot;The main increase in trade was considered likely to take place in perishable produce and fragile articles (pottery and glass) , which might compete more severely on the British market with British manufactures. The Board of Trade considered that the amount of shipping likely to be displaced by the Tunnel was insignificant, and that &quot; financially there is serious reason to doubt whether the scheme could be successful. It is improbable that the Tunnel could be utilised effectively for the purpose of bringing into the country any large supplies of food and raw materials in time of war.&quot;17. The Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith) in summing up the discussion quoted what Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had said in 1907, namely: &quot; Even supposing the military dangers involved were to be amply provided against, there would exist through the country a feeling of insecurity which might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and military, and a continual risk of unrest and possible alarm, which, however unfounded, would be most injurious in its effects, whether political or commercial.&quot;No one, said Mr. Asquith, had been able to refute that dictum. He pointed out that the advocates of the project wanted the Tunnel to be indestructible, whereas the First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;s condition was that it should be destructible.18.   The Conclusion of the Committee was as follows :-&apos;&apos; The Committee are of opinion that the strategical conditions have not sq altered as to justify a reversal of the Conclusion reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1907.&quot;The First Lord (Mr.. Churchill) and the First Sea Lord (Prince Louis of Battenberg) expressed their dissent, giving as their reason the statement quoted above in paragraphs 11 and 12, namely, that complete security could be obtained by exposing the exits of the Tunnel to sea-power, conditions which, after the war, were rejected. Sir John French also dissented*; but the Second Sea Lord (Sir John Jellicoe), the Chief of the Staff Designate (Admiral Sir Frederick Sturdee), the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (General Douglas) and the Director of Military Operations (General Henry Wilson), as well as Lord Fisher and Lord Nicholson, were among the parties to the Conclusion.Within a few days of the above Conclusion being reached by the Committee of Imperial Defence the war clouds had gathered. The public mind was occupied with other events, and no announcement was made in Parliament. It was not until the 26th October, 1916, that Mr. Asquith made that Conclusion public when replying to a deputation from a House of Commons Committee on the Channel Tunnel.* It has been stated recently in a letter to the &quot; Times&quot; that Lord French revised his view as a result of his experience in the war (see Appendix III).
;     . The Channel Tunnel during the War. &apos; &apos;19! The question of the Channel Tunnel was raised once again by Mr. Fell, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, during the War. Consultation with the Departments produced no change of view, and naturally the general desire was that the question should be postponed until after the War. Mr.&apos; Asquith received a Deputation in October 1916, and seems to have been friendly but non-committal.The Enquiry of 1919-20.1 20. The subject of the Channel Tunnel was again brought forward by the Channel Tunnel Committee in 1919. The subject was considered in a preliminary way by the Cabinet on the 11th November, 1919. The Conclusion recorded is as follows : &quot; Subject to there being no danger as to the security of the country, a point on which the view was expressed that further technical enquiry was necessary, the general trend of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of not opposing the construction of a Channel Tunnel.&quot;   (Cabinet 5 (19), Conclusion 4.)That was the general line taken by Mr. Lloyd George, who received a deputation on the subject on the following day, an account of which is given in the Memorandum sent to the Prime Minister by the Channel Tunnel Committee. (C.I.D. Paper 121-A, p. 9.)21.   The technical enquiry which the Cabinet had considered necessary was begun by the Home Ports Defence Committee (since re-named &quot; The Home Defence j Committee &quot;), which was asked to advise not on the general question as to whether i the construction of a Tunnel was desirable or not, but as to what conditions were necessary from a naval, military and air point of view to ensure the security of the j exit of the Tunnel if it were built.22. The Memorandum by the Home Ports Defence Committee deals exhaustively with the question referred to it (C.I.D. Paper 92-A). The Conclusions of the Committee are as follows :- &quot;21. To summarise, the Home Ports Defence Committee are of opinion that the following conditions should be complied with : (a) The scale and forms of Defence (Naval, Military and Air) must be such as to deal effectively with a raiding attack by such force as may from time to time be considered possible, and also other forms of&apos; attack to which the British end of a Tunnel, the Tunnel works and the Tunnel itself may be exposed, i.e.: (1.) Bombardment from the sea or from the French or Belgian coasts,or bombing by aircraft; (2.) Surprise attacks carried out by small raiding parties, landed from the sea or from aircraft; i! (3.) Sabotage;(4.) Attempts to destroy the Tunnel by means of explosive charges placed on the bed of the Channel or by boring; I (5.) Attempts by secret agents to place explosive charges withclockwork mechanism in trains passing through the Tunnel.(b.) Means to be provided for putting the Tunnel out of service temporarily, or permanently, or both, as desired : (i.) Permanent Flooding. Sluices to admit the sea and arrangements for quickly placing explosive charges in a chamber midway between the sea and the top of the Tunnel have been suggested, but until the actual plans of the Tunnel are available, and the question can be considered as an engineering proposition, no final decision as to the precise method of permanently flooding the Tunnel can be arrived at. Some effective means must, however, be provided for flooding the whole of the Tunnel in the last emergency, and in any case chambers for explosive charges must be provided.
r; (ii.) Temporary Flooding.-A -dip &apos; in the Tunnel to be constructedwithin three miles of the British coast, and arrangements to be made for flooding this &apos; dip &apos; either from the sea or from a reservoir.(c.) All the arrangements for putting the Tunnel out of service, either . temporarily or permanently, and all the machinery installations vital to its use to be duplicated and put so far as practicable underground;each installation being separate, guarded at all times, and surroundedby obstacles; and electric lights to be provided to illuminate theground in the vicinity by night. id.) The Tunnel to be constructed at such depth below the bed of the seaas will ensure its immunity from damage by explosives placed on the bottom of the sea. (e.) The entrance of the Tunnel on the British side to be : (i.) Duplicated.(ii.) So situated and constructed as to render its destruction from the sea or from the land on the opposite side of the Straits extremely improbable, (iii.) So far as practicable away from the coast and hidden from observation.(iv.) Protected by obstacles as well as by armed troops.(/.) Some guns to be so mounted as to be capable of firing on the Tunnel entrances.(g.) Important yards and junctions to be sited well inland; and one or more yards to be constructed in preference to one large one, viz., one for up traffic, one for down traffic, and one for locomotives.(h.) An obstacle and a blockhouse in rear of it to be provided at the English end of the Tunnel; and other simple methods (such as engineering science may devise) for temporarily preventing, if necessary, the progress of trains in the Tunnel to be provided, e.g., taking up or short-circuiting rails, impassable ditch or drawbridge near the British exit and under gun fire.(i.) The power station to be sited on the English side.(j.) Arrangements to be made for the scrutiny, in times of strained relations, of all packages and luggage before loading on trains about to pass through the Tunnel; and also for an examining post within the British end of the Tunnel, where trains could be stopped.22. As regards the responsibility for putting into action any means for putting the Tunnel out of service, the Committee are of opinion that it is of vital importance that this responsibility should be clearly defined. This would be simplified if the Tunnel were Government-owned.23. The Committee are unable at this juncture to make any recommenda-tions further to those enumerated above for securing the safety of the United Kingdom against the use of the Tunnel for invasion purposes, and for safe-guarding the Tunnel itself against being put out of service. They are of opinion that the resources of engineering science may devise other methods, and, if so, that these should be carefully considered and adopted if found effective.24. Whilst they are of opinion that the mechanical devices outlined above would ensure the security of the Tunnel in theory, they recognise that in practice the personal factor will always introduce a certain element of danger.They accordingly desire to lay stress on the fact that the ultimate security against an enemy in occupation of the continental end of the Tunnel being able to use it for invasion purposes rests on the fundamental condition of its being possible to ensure that the British end should not be seized by a raiding force. Only armed force can absolutely secure this, and it is consequently essential to provide for the garrisoning at all times in the vicinity of the Tunnel entrance of a mobile force sufficient to deal successfully with a raiding attack, the strength of which will have to be kept constantly under review.&quot;23.   There are two points in the Report of the Committee to which reference should perhaps be made : 
First, the Committee rejected the proposals on which the Admiralty had insisted in 1914 for enabling the Tunnel to be put out of action by our fleet by the construction of a lighthouse some way out in the Channel, the destruction of which would flood the Tunnel, and by bringing the line at the point of emergence within range of the guns of our fleet.The reason for the rejection of these proposals was that, owing to the experience of the war, it was thought these safeguards might be destroyed by an enemy, whether by submarine or aircraft attack, and that the Tunnel might be flooded at a time when we wished to use it ourselves. Thus the measures which had been regarded by the Admiralty as indispensable in 1914 Avere already out of date in 1920.24. The second point to which attention is directed is that, although the expenditure involved in most of the recommendations of the Committee would presumably be borne by the Company which constructed the Tunnel, the additional garrison and defences of Dover involved in recommendations (a) and (/) would presumably haA^e to be borne by the State unless paid for by a special tax on the Tunnel traffic. If the State itself built the Tunnel, presumably the cost of the garrison and defences would be a first charge on any profits earned from its operation.25. In addition to the report by the Home Ports Defence Committee, a number of departmental Memoranda were prepared in 1919-20, and these will now be summarised.26. The Admiralty in 1920 advised that, &quot;subject to the conditions for security enumerated in H.P.D.C. Memorandum No. 40-M (C.I.D. Paper 92-A) being adopted, the Admiralty see no objection to the scheme.&quot;27. The Air Council expressed the opinion : &apos;&apos; That the aerial interests of this countrv would not be affected either favourably or otherwise by the construction of a Channel Tunnel.&quot;  (C.I.D. Paper 95-A.)28. The Secretary of State for War (Mr. Churchill) forwarded two Memoranda by the General Staff signed by Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson. The first dealt with the probable effect which the existence of a Channel Tunnel would have had in the recent war. Sir Henry Wilson found it difficult to say what would have been the general effect had the Channel Tunnel been in existence in 1914. He had no doubt, however, that as regards mobilisation there would have been a gain of at least forty-eight hours in the Expeditionary Force reaching the French coast if the Channel Tunnel had existed. From the enemy&apos;s point of view he considered that the Channel Tunnel would have formed a strategic objective of the first importance. The Germans might have concentrated their initial effort on the capture and occupation of Calais and the Tunnel mouth, and probably Boulogne, prior to an advance on Paris. Thus the Tunnel would have acted as a magnet drawing the enemy in a direction which would have proved most fatal to the Allies. The British, in the Field-MarshaFs view, would hardly have consented to any operation which left the Tunnel mouth uncovered. Unless the French had been Avilling to modify their plans so as to ensure that the left of their forces always kept in touch with our troops instead of our right keeping in touch with their&apos; left (a fundamentally different conception), the result would have been that the Expeditionary Force would have been separated from the French army. If the opening weeks of the campaign had turned out as unfortunately as they actually did in&apos; 1914 we should have run a grave risk of losing the greater part of the Expeditionary Force and the exit of the Channel Tunnel as well. &quot;With a force of only six Divisions under the conditions given and under the opening moves of the campaign in 1914 as they actually took place, it is not too much to say that the existence of the Tunnel in that year would have lost us the campaign. It is probable, however, that the French would have realised in advance the enormous importance of the Channel Tunnel, and would have remodelled their plan of campaign accordingly.&quot; The late Field-MarshaFs views appear to be fairly summed up in the following paragraph : &quot;In general, therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the existence of the Channel Tunnel would have eliminated the delay in mobilisation caused by the uncertainty in.the minds of the Government, the subsequent speed of[18755] c
concentration would have been increased &quot;by two or three days, and the first . battles of the campaign would have been fought when the Allied forces had been fully concentrated in Belgium, and consequently in circumstances less unfavourable than actually occurred in 1914. Had the battle ended decidedly in our favour the whole strategy, and possibly the duration, of the campaign would have been altered, whilst if it had been indecisive there is some reason for supposing that the end of 1914 would have found the Allies holding a line considerably in advance of the one actually occupied, and the resources of the areas which include coal and iron products from Bruay to Charleroi would have accrued to the Allies instead of to the Germans. If, however, the Allies had suffered a decisive defeat, there is every reason to suppose that the British Army would either have been driven past the exits of the Tunnel and left the enemy established at Calais and Boulogne, or that the British and French Armies would have retreated in different directions. In either case it is difficult to see how we could have escaped disaster.&quot;29. In a second Memorandum, containing notes on the military advantages and disadvantages of the Channel Tunnel, 1 Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson reached the following conclusions :  &quot; (i.) Assuming France to be friendly, the Tunnel is highly desirable on economic grounds as affecting the development and maintenance of military forces in war.(ii.) If our policy is irrevocably bound to the defence of France and Belgium, it is essential on military grounds.(iii.) Such a policy entails the maintenance of military forces on a scale commensurate with that of our potential enemies, both as regards numbers and degree of readiness. It further requires a firm determination on the part of the Government to mobilise at the same time as our Allies and enemies.(iv.) The Tunnel contains an element of danger, however perfect the security arrangements, owing to the personal factor. These dangers increase by so much as our standard of military preparedness falls, whilst the military advantages of the Tunnel correspondingly decrease.(v.) Unless we are prepared to intervene on the continent on a continental scale, the military advantages of the Tunnel do not outweigh the military disadvantages; that is to say, for an offensive war on the continent we want the Tunnel, but for a defensive war in England we do not.(vi.) The maintenance of the Tunnel cannot be absolutely guaranteed, and therefore it is essential to have a second (and purely sea) base at the same time.(vii.) Government ownership of the Tunnel, if constructed, is strongly advocated, as tending to facilitate the taking of measures either &quot;for its security or destruction.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper 98-A.)30. Mr. Churchill in his covering note, commented as follows on the General Staff Memoranda: &apos;&apos; In these circumstances it would appear that, if the commercial advantages are sufficient in themselves, the War Office would not be justified in vetoing the project on military grounds.&quot;31. The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Austen Chamberlain), however, after a careful analysis of the Chief of the Imperial General Staffs Memoranda, drew special attention, to the following hypotheses adopted by Sir Henry Wilson : &quot; (i.) That had the Tunnel existed, our obligation to France would have been of a more definite nature, and one which would have exerted astabilising effect on the attitude of Belgium, (ii.) That &apos; our forces are proportionate to our responsibilities,&apos; which heinterpreted to involve conscription and an army on the pre-warcontinental model, (iii.) That the Tunnel is constructed and owned by Government.
(iv.) That alternative sea bases and means of transport must be maintainedto take the place of the Tunnel if destroyed, (v.) That , French strategical plans are so re-cast  as to  secure  French co-operation in the defence of the Tunnel.&quot;To these five conditions Mr. Chamberlain added the recommendation of the Home Ports Defence Committee in favour of &quot;an extended naval defence and land defences, the garrisoning at all times of a. mobile force in the vicinity, and the provision of an efficient air defence and anti-aircraft defence,&quot; as well as &quot; that the Tunnel must be placed so far below the bottom of the Channel as to guard it against destruction by explosive charges placed on the bed of the sea.&quot;&quot;These requirements,&quot; wrote Mr. Chamberlain, &quot;when thus placed together, make the Tunnel so completely master of both our military and political future that they seem to me conclusive against its construction. It is scarcely too much to say that, if we accept them all, England would exist for the defence of the Tunnel rather than the Tunnel for the defence of England.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper 99-A.)32. The considered view of the Foreign Office was forwarded to the Committee of Imperial Defence by Lord Curzon, the general tenor of which is shown by the following extracts : &quot; The pith of the question appears to be whether it is desirable to construct a tunnel under the Channel, costing anything between thirty and fifty millions sterling, which may conceivably within a few years have to be destroyed at a moment&apos;s notice when war is thought to be impending or has been declared. The whole question is dependent upon the stability of friendly relations between France and this country. If we could be convinced that we and the French would maintain a perpetual friendship and never quarrel, then it is obvious that there would be a distinct advantage in having a tunnel, although the economic advantages to be obtained from it are not so real as might be imagined. Consequently, the question resolves itself into that of the relations in the near and distant future between England and France.It must be remembered that until a century ago France was England&apos;s historic and natural enemy, and that real friendship between the inhabitants of the two countries has always been very difficult owing to differences of language, mentality and national character. These differences are not likely to decrease. The slightest incident may arouse the resentment or jealousy of the French and fan the latent embers of suspicion into a flame. Nor can Great Britain place any reliance upon public opinion in France being well balanced and reasonable. It is within the memory of many of us that in 1893, when there was trouble with France over the boundaries of Siam, war was wuthin an ace of being provoked by the aggressive entry of Admiral Humann with his gunboats into the Menam River, and by his passing with his ships cleared for action a British warship stationed in those waters. It was only the coolness and self-restraint of the British officer in command that prevented a conflict. Then again, in 1898, relations between England and France were at breaking point over the Fashoda incident. Lastly, it must not be forgotten that the attitude of France towards this country during the Boer war could hardly have been more hostile without a positive rupture.*,*****Nothing can alter the fundamental fact that we are not liked in France, and never will be, except for the advantages which the French people may be able to extract from us.These considerations point conclusively to the imprudence, and even danger, of increasing at enormous cost the facilities of communication with France by means of a tunnel under the Channel which may have to be destroyed at any moment as a military measure to secure the safety of this country in the event of France assuming a hostile and aggressive attitude. The destruction of the tunnel at such a moment, however necessary, might do more permanently to embitter relations between the two countries than its construction could ever do to cement them. The Foreign Office conclusion is that our relations with France never have been, are not, and probably never will be, sufficiently stable and friendly to justify the construction of a Channel tunnel, and the loss of the &quot; security which our insular position, even in spite of the wonderful scientific and mechanical developments of recent years, still continues to bestow.&quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 101-A.)[18755] c 2
33. The President of the Board of Trade (Sir Auckland Geddes) considered it unnecessary to review the economic considerations bearing on the proposals for a Channel Tunnel which had been considered by the Government on previous occasions, since, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, &quot; the encouragement of such an undertaking during the financial stringency which must continue for some years to come would be entirely unjustifiable.&quot; The President of the Board of Trade considered that it would be madness to recommend the locking up of a very large sum, which he considered might amount to as much as  60,000,000, in an enterprise of this character.   (C.I.D. Paper 94-A.)   &apos;34. The Minister of Transport (Sir Eric Geddes) (C.I.D. Paper No. 97-A) advised that a double tube tunnel as proposed would cost  60,000,000, but that a single tube with crossing places could be built for  38,000,000, to which  3,500,000 would have to be added for approach lines, marshalling yards, alterations to South Eastern and Chatham Railway, rolling-stock, &amp;c. Without committing himself definitely, he thought it possible that a tunnel might pay with an all-round 5\ per cent, interest on the capital invested, unless the naval and military requirements added materially to the cost or rendered the tunnel unpopular owing to the arrangements for its drastic and immediate destruction. After commenting on the difference between the British and Continental gauge, he continued : 1&apos; As regards passengers this could easily be arranged, at a cost of some  2,500,000 which is included in the estimated figures given above by an alteration of the South Eastern line to London, where passengers would naturally tranship.As regards goods vehicles, transhipment would be necessary, and in the case of our rolling-stock going to the Continent the differences in the buffering and coupling would prevent free exchange. Moreover, there is no likelihood of alterations in rolling-stock which would eliminate this factor.&quot;Sir Eric Geddes&apos; conclusion was as follows : &quot;Apart from these unknown factors, however, and assuming that naval and military opinion does not condemn the scheme, I should advise its very favourable consideration and further investigation as to cost of construction, cost of working, depreciation and maintenance, and investigation as to the revenue obtainable.&quot;35. In addition to the Departmental Memoranda summarised above, Mr. Balfour, the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, in a brief but very searching examination of the problem, reached the following conclusion : &quot; On the whole, after considerable hesitations and some vacillation ofopinion, I am inclined to think that the old decision should be upheld.&quot;Mr. Balfour&apos;s Memorandum hardly lends itself to summary, but a few extracts may be of interest:  &quot;I do not dwell upon the risks which are inseparable from the most cunningly devised schemes for denying, at the right moment, the use of the Tunnel to an enemy.   All such schemes may be defeated by some accident happening to a complicated machine, or a nervous official losing his head. * * * * * *The dangers I have adverted to are known, and in a certain sense are calculable, but I am even more afraid of the dangers which are not known and which are not calculable. All that has happened in the last five years - in the way of military and naval development submarines, aircraft and long-range guns have tended without exception to render the Channel Tunnel a more dangerous experiment. These have all made it more difficult for us to be sure that it will be open when we want it open, and closed when we want it closed.And have we the least ground for thinking that the process is going to be reversed ? And if it is not, if after the economic and sound habits of the world have adjusted themselves to this new mode of access to the Continent we find that it is fatal to our safety, what are we going to do? Destroy the Tunnel in times of profound peace? Impossible! Wait till its dangers have been proved by a disastrous war ? Still more impossible! The riddle will be insoluble.
It may of course be said that the unknown dangers which. I fear may possibly be of a kind which will put an end to our position as an island Power, and make the command of the sea useless as a means of defence. It may be so; but let us wait till it is so, and so long as the ocean remains our friend do not let us deliberately destroy its power to help us.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper 96-A.)36. It is perhaps worth mentioning that the Minister of Health (Dr. Addison) circulated a Memorandum to the Committee of Imperial Defence in which he stated that he had begun with a prejudice in favour of the Channel Tunnel, but that, after reading the various Memoranda on the subject, he had come to the conclusion that the matter was attended with real risk, &quot; and that we might in consequence find ourselves hereafter involved in the adoption of compulsory military service or in running serious risks in the absence of its adoption.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper 100-A.)37. The numerous Memoranda of 1919-20 referred to above were never discussed by the Committee of Imperial Defence or the Cabinet. The pressure from the promoters of the scheme relaxed, possibly owing to the financial stringency then existing. The scheme on examination had been found much less attractive than it had appeared at first sight. It had been criticised on grounds of foreign policy, cost and financial expediency. Military opinion, if less pronouncedly opposed to the scheme than in the past, was not very encouraging. In these circumstances no one wished to raise the question, which was allowed quietly to drop without a formal decision being reached, and no announcement was made in Parliament.Discussion in 1922.38. In February 1922 the Foreign Office forwarded to the Committee of Imperial Defence a note from the French Ambassador stating that the French Government had been informed by the International Chamber of Commerce that the proposed construction of the Channel Tunnel was approved at their Congress held in London in July last, and enquiring whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would now agree to a suggestion already made by the French Government that a joint Anglo-French Commission should examine the question (C.I.D. Paper 104-A). The question was brought before the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 14th May, 1922, when the following Conclusion was reached : &quot; The Committee concurred in Lord Curzon&apos;s proposal to reply to the French Ambassador to the effect that, in view of the present financial situation in this country, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not at present prepared to consider the question of a joint Commission of Enquiry&quot; (Minutes of the 156th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence).The Enquiry of 1924.39. The question of a Channel Tunnel was next raised in 1924, when the Labour-Ministry was in office. All the Departments were once more invited to express their views, which will now be summarised.40. As regards the Foreign Office, Sir Eyre Crowe informed the Committee that their Paper of May 1920, summarised above in paragraph 32, still represented the views of the Office.  He added, however, the following :  &quot; The Secretary of State, however, regards this question primarily as military, and, secondly, as one involving considerations of transport and commerce. The Foreign Office as such ought, therefore, he considers, to have no over-riding views.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper 123-A.)41. The Minister of Transport (Mr. Gosling) did not feel it necessary to add much to the letter of Sir Eric Geddes, quoted above in paragraph 34, but he added the following : &quot; I desire, however, to call attention to the.fact that the direct advantages to be-derived from the scheme, if carried out, would accrue almost entirely to passengers, though some advantage would be gained by the easier importation of merchandise by passenger train, such as fruit and flowers from the Soutv of
France. From my point of view, as Minister of Transport, I should much welcome the undoubted increase in facilities which would be afforded by the Tunnel, even though those facilities might be rather for pleasure than for commercial purposes.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper No. 124-A.)As regards the cost, Mr. Gosling was &quot;not prepared to say that the promoters3 estimate (now  29,000,000) would necessarily be very much exceeded. As, however, Sir Eric Geddes pointed out, additional expenditure would be necessary in any case on the Southern Railway, and further considerable expenditure on that railway would be necessary if the full advantages of through running were to be obtained.&quot;Mr. Gosling thought that the promoters should be pressed to explain in detail their proposals for enabling Continental rolling-stock to be conveyed on their lines or alternative arrangements for constructing special rolling-stock which could be used on Continental lines.42. The President of the Board of Trade (Mr. Sidney Webb) adhered generally to the Board of Trade Memorandum of 1914, and stated that &quot; There do not appear to be any new developments calculated to reduce materially the force of the statements .... as to the relatively small extent to which the Tunnel is likely to be utilised for the transport of merchandise. The aggregate value of the imports of Dover and Folkestone were smaller in 1922 than in 1913, in spite of the general rise in prices in the interval, and the same is true of British exports shipped outwards at these ports.As regards the obstacle to trade in certain classes of articles which is imposed by the risks of loading into and unloading from ships, or by the cost of the packing necessary to obviate these risks, the experience gained during the War in the operation of train-ferries appears to indicate that the breaking of bulk could be avoided by the development of that mode of transport. Further experience with the Harwich-Zeebrugge ferry will furnish additional evidence on this subject&apos;.I do not think that there are any new reasons which I should urge, in the interests of the country&apos;s trade, why obstacles to the construction of the Tunnel should be over-ridden.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper No. 126-A.)43. The Chiefs of Staff Committee circulated a Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 125-A), the general tenor of which is shown by the following extracts : &quot;2. The principal military advantage to be derived from the construction of a Channel Tunnel would be a gain of not much exceeding 48 hours as corn-pared with uninterrupted sea transport in the concentration and deployment, as in 1914, of an Expeditionary Force of, say, six Infantry and one Cavalry Divisions on the continent of Europe.3. From a naval point of view there would be the disadvantage that if the Channel Tunnel were constructed, in all probability a large proportion of the cross-Channel steamer services would disappear. These services include a number of fast, small craft and a personnel which, as was shown in the late War, are of great value both to the Fleet and for combined operations. The disappearance of the cross-Channel services, therefore, would deprive us of an important element in our sea-power.4. It also appears probable that the construction of a Channel Tunnel would have an adverse effect on the development of the cross-Channel air services, and, by injuring civil aviation, would weaken one of the supports of our air-power.5. From the point of view of security we do not wish to over-state the risk. In the past the principal danger alleged has been that an enemy who held the Continental end of the Tunnel might, by a coivp de m,ain, seize the British entrance before it had been put out of action. He would then be in possession of a bridgehead with a secure military line of communication behind him for the invasion of this country. This presupposes a seaborne raid on Dover, possibly accompanied by the passage, by stratagem, of an armed force through the Tunnel and supported by concerted operations in the air, with the object of dislocating the defence and interrupting the arrival of reinforcements.&quot;
After discussing the possibility of a raid as a &quot; bolt from the blue &quot; in time of profound peace, which the Committee of Imperial Defence had repeatedly declared to be &quot;not sufficiently remote to be ignored,&quot; the Chiefs of Staff continued :  &quot;8. In the event of strained relations the risk would be considerably less, particularly if the Precautionary Stage of our War Book and Defence Schemes had been put in operation. The principal danger would be that the enemy might precipitate hostilities and deliver a raid simultaneously with the outbreak of war, as in the case of the surprise attack on Liege on the night of the 3/4th August, 1914.9. Wide differences of opinion have existed in the past between the highest naval and military authorities as to the degree of importance to be attached to these risks and as to the extent to which the problem is affected by the possible failure at the critical moment either of the human element or of the mechanical devices for putting the Tunnel out of action. On this subject we do not wish to dogmatise, but we concur with the view expressed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in his announcement in Parliament on the 21st March, 1907, that &apos; Even supposing the military dangers involved were to be amply guarded against, there would exist throughout the country a feeling of insecurity which might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and military, and a continued risk of unrest and possibly alarm which, however unfounded, would be most injurious in its effect, whether political or commercial,&apos;It is by no means unlikely, for example, that the existence of a Tunnel (particularly in the event of an international crisis) might lead to a public demand for measures, whether of naval, military or air defence, which would tend to concentrate an undue proportion of our limited defensive resources in the region of the Tunnel to the detriment of the general defence of the country.&quot;After expressing their agreement with Lord Balfour&apos;s Memorandum, summarised above in paragraph 35, the Chiefs of Staff also expressed their concurrence in the view of the Home Ports Defence Committee and of Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, that, if the Tunnel were constructed, Government ownership would tend to facilitate the taking of measures whether for its security or destruction.44. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald decided to deal with the question outside of the sphere of party politics, and, accordingly, at his invitation, the following ex-Prime Ministers attended the 186th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 1st July, 1924 : Lord Balfour, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George. A copy of the Minutes, which are of considerable interest, is attached to this summary ^Appendix I. It will be seen that the Committee of Imperial Defence recommended unanimously that at the present time the Channel Tunnel should not be proceeded with.45. This recommendation was adopted, and on the 7th July, 1924, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald made, in the House of Commons, the announcement con-tained in Appendix II.M. P. A. HANKEY.January 18, 1929.

Minutes 156th Meeting, Minute 4.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the proposal for the construction of a Channel Tunnel (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 92-A, 93-A, 94-A, 95--A, 96-A, 98-A, 99-A. 100-A, 104-A, 121-A, 122-A, 123-A. 124-A, 125-A. 126-A, 127-A and 128-A).THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the 26th June he had received a deputation of members of the House of Commons Channel Tunnel Committee, who claimed that virtually some 400 Members of the House of Commons had declared their intention to support the scheme for a Channel Tunnel. The deputation considered that conditions affecting the tunnel had so materially changed since 1914 that they had requested the Government to reconsider the problem. He had felt that a decision on this question should be kept clear of party politics, and consequently he had invited the ex-Prime Ministers who had been Chairmen of
the Committee of Imperial Defence, and most of whom had considered this question in the past, to attend this meeting and to be good enough to assist the Committee with their advice.LORD BEATTY stated that the Chiefs.of Staff Sub-Committee, under the Chairmanship of Lord Haldane, had lately gone thoroughly into this question, and their Report had been circulated as C.I.D. Paper No. 125-A. The. Military danger of a tunnel was not serious, but a slight danger must necessarily exist; that fact alone made them feel that the great advantage possessed by this country of being surrounded by water should not be foregone unless there were great advantages to be gained. The&apos; Sub-Committee had taken into consideration the views expressed by the Foreign Office and other Departments, and there did not appear to be any sufficient compensation which would enable them to advise in favour of construction of a tunnel; in fact, the views of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee were well expressed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&apos;s statement in 19Q7, that &quot; Even supposing the Military dangers involved were to be amply guarded against, there would exist throughout the country a feeling of insecurity which.might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, Naval and Military, and a continued risk of unrest and possibly alarm, which, however unfounded, would be most injurious in its effect, whether political or commercial.&quot; In times of strained relations the existence of a tunnel might lead to a public demand for defence measures which would tend to concentrate an undue proportion of our limited defence resources in the region of the tunnel to the detriment of the general defence of the country. From a Naval point of view there would be the additional disadvantage that if the Channel Tunnel were, constructed the cross Channel steamer services would disappear. These services form a magnificent auxiliary, both m material and personnel, to the Naval Forces of the Empire. They had been proved to be of great value during the late war and formed an important part of the Naval Reserve. The construction of a tunnel would probably have an adverse, effect on the development of civil aviation and would weaken one of the supports of our Air power. He considered that Lord Balfour had summed up the whole situation in his Memorandum (OLD. Paper No. 96-A), in which he stated that &quot; So long as the ocean remains our friend, do not let us deliberately destroy its power to help us.&quot;LORD CAVAN stated that from the purely Military point of view he would prefer that a tunnel should not be constructed. The existence of a tunnel was bound to add to the anxieties of those in control, was bound to add to our commitments, and consequently was bound to add to our expenditure on defence forces.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD concurred that the existence of the Channel Tunnel would be an added danger and an added commitment from the defence point of view. He pointed out that the best laid schemes for putting the tunnel out of action might be dislocated by a determined enemy. He considered that the large Air Forces in being on the Continent made the possibility of a &quot; bolt from the blue &quot; more probable, in which case a small and determined force of the enemy might conceivably gain possession of our end of the tunnel, and, supported by a strong concentration of their Air Force, might successfully hold the Tunnel exit for two or three days, during which time the passage of considerable forces could have taken place.LORD BALFOUR stated that in 1920 he had written a Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 96a) which expressed his opinion on the subject. He still adhered to those views. They had been arrived at with some hesitation, since, during the war, he had sometimes been inclined to consider that the existence of a tunnel would have been of the greatest assistance to our Army in France, but, on further reflection, after the war, he had&quot;reverted with undiminished strength to the opinions which he had previously held on the subject.Mr. ASQUITH said that he was in complete agreement with the opinions expressed, by Lord Balfour in the Memorandum to which the latter had referred. He himself had taken part in two inquiries on the subject; firstly, under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman in 1907, and secondly, in 1914, when he was himself Prime Minister. Both these inquiries had arrived at the same conclusion, and all naval and military authorities, with the two exceptions of Sir John French and Prince Louis of Battenburg, had been opposed to the project-He had, however, been of the opinion that changes in the strategical situation might
M some future date militate against the naval and military objections. He considered, however, that at the present time the changes in the strategical situation had strengthened rather than lessened such objections.Mr. LLOYD GEORGE stated that he was entirely in agreement with the -opinions expressed by Lord Balfour and Mr. Asquith.   In 1919 the Government of the day had been rather disposed to regard the problem with favour, but this fact was largely due to the atmosphere resulting from war.   The matter had then been referred to a special inquiry, which had undoubtedly started with a prejudice in favour of the construction of a tunnel, but, as the inquiry had proceeded, it had been found that the objections from the point of view of the defence of the country outweighed any advantages which might be expected to accrue.   He expressed the opinion that many of the 400 Members of Parliament, who were stated by the Chairman of the Deputation which had been received by the Prime Minister to give their support to the project, would, after due reflection and after hearing the objections to the proposal, hesitate to pledge themselves to a scheme which might rove detrimental to the safety of this country.   So far these Members of Parliament ad only heard one side of the story.  He considered that not only were there military reasons against the scheme, but also psychological reasons which would tend to alter the conduct of our foreign policy and our diplomatic negotiations.   The Committee had listened to the views expressed by the naval, military and air experts, who had all agreed that no guarantee could be given with regard to the defensibility of the tunnel.   He pointed out that the French experts would in all probability reach the same conclusion, and would advise their Government to that effect, so that the French would always have it in mind that they could strike a sudden blow at this country. If the tunnel was constructed, therefore, it might tend to weaken our diplomacy. He considered that the possibility of an attempt to seize the British end of the tunnel being backed up by strong aerial attacks, to which the Chief of the Air Staff had called attention, added additional arguments against the construction of the tunnel. In short, he looked upon the tunnel as a very dangerous experiment, which should be postponed until  all  possibilities of conflict with a European nation had disappeared.Mr. BALDWIN stated that he had never been directly concerned in any previous inquiry in connection with this subject. The opinion expressed in Lord Balfour&apos;s memorandum, however, entirely represented his own views on the subject. He was in agreement with Mr. Asquith, that the reasons against the construction of a tunnel were stronger now than they had been when the question was previously considered. He also agreed with Mr. Lloyd George that there were psychological reasons against the construction of the tunnel, and he considered the House of Commons would -oppose the. construction when they were in possession of all the arguments against such a course.LORD BALFOUR enquired as to whether the statement put forward by the Board of Trade with regard to the economic aspects of the Channel Tunnel scheme was not in reality a new argument against the tunnel.Mr. LLOYD GEORGE stated that the same argument was used in 1920, and Mr. ASQUITH pointed out that it was also employed in 1907 and 1914.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that his own predisposition in viewing this problem was the same as that which had been held by Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George, namely, favourable to the scheme. On that basis he.started with the assumption that, if no overriding reasons could be adduced against the tunnel, he would be inclined to favour its construction. He considered that the ordinary man in the street would be inclined to favour that view. He himself had been much impressed by Lord Balfour&apos;s Memorandum.. He pointed out that the Committee might take one of three positions: firstly, favourable to the construction; secondly, to oppose the scheme most decisively; or, thirdly, to adopt a middle course that, in spite of the military reasons against its construction, the arguments adduced by the business world in favour of the scheme should be permitted to outweigh military considerations. The whole opinion, however, of the meeting appeared to be opposed to the project.Mr. WEBB stated that he had approached the subject with a similar pre-disposition in favour of the Tunnel, but as he went into the question it seemed to him that all the arguments were against the proposal.   From a Trade point of view the
existence of a tunnel would, dry .up the present cross-Channel services and would provide no counter-balancing advantages to trade of an appreciable character. He pointed out that the tendency during the last few years had been for a falling-off in the use by trade of the fast cross-Channel services. The value of the imports and exports by cross-Channel steamers had lessened considerably of late. Consequently, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, the Tunnel would receive a very small revenue from goods services but considerable revenue from a luxury passenger service, whichi if it took place, would kill the cross-Channel services. There would, howrever, be no&apos; trade advantages. One of the arguments for&apos; a tunnel commonly put forward was the desirability of not breaking bulk during the transit of goods. He pointed out that the use of train ferries, similar to those running between Harwich and Holland, met this argument. He considered that the estimate of revenue by the promoters was extremely sanguine, but he was doubtful whether the scheme could be made a success financially. The present cost of the construction of the Tunnel was largely in excess of the original estimates, and he expected that the promoters would require both the British and French Governments to provide them with a financial Grant in Aid.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in their Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 125-A) had expressed the view that if the tunnel were constructed Government ownership would tend to facilitate the taking of measures, whether for its security or destruction. To sum up, it appeared that the unanimous opinion of the Committee Avas against the construction of the tunnel at the present time.Conclusion.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE recommend that at the present time the Channel Tunnel should not be proceeded with.(Lord Balfour, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Baldwin then withdrew.)-(2.) The Procedure to be Adopted with regard to Publication of the Conclusion as regards the Channel Tunnel.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that he wished to ask the advice of the Committee with regard to the procedure to be adopted in making public the decision which had been arrived at. He suggested that a communique should be issued to the press stating that a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence had been held to consider this question, and that Lord Balfour, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Baldwin had been present. He considered that the arguments employed by the various speakers should not be allowed to appear in the communique, but that the question should be considered by the Cabinet.After some discussion, it was agreed that Lord Balfour&apos;s memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 96-A) should be circulated to the Cabinet, and that the question should be considered by the Cabinet at their meeting, to be held the following day, Wednesday,, the 2nd July, 1924.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 1, 1924.APPENDIX II.Statement by the Prime Minister (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald) in the House of Commons-on Monday, July 7, 1924, on the Subject of the Channel Tunnel.THE PRIME MINISTER : The Government have had under consideration the question of the Channel Tunnel, which was brought to their notice by the Members of the House of Commons Channel Tunnel Committee. In a Memorandum with which the Committee were good enough to furnish me, it is stated that virtually 400 Members of this House have now declared their intention to support the scheme. Some Members attached the condition, to which the House of Commons Channel [18755] e
Tunnel Committee assented, that the approval of the naval and military authorities and of the Committee of Imperial Defence should first be given, and the Committee gave me to understand that the promoters would, in the absence of such approval, be unwilling to launch the project.I accordingly decided to refer the matter to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and, partly in order to reinforce the Government by the opinion of those who had had the responsibility of deciding this question in the past, and partly with a view to removing it altogether from the sphere of party politics, I invited the four former Prime Ministers, who had been chairmen of the Committee of Imperial Defence [Lord Balfour, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Baldwin], to attend a meeting on the subject.The members of the Committee of Imperial Defence, including the former Prime Ministers, were given all possible information bearing on the subject. Apart from several communications from the House of Commons Channel Tunnel Committee, including some notes on French official opinion, and the verbatim notes of their deputation to myself, the Committee of Imperial Defence were furnished with an exhaustive summary of the earlier history of the question. In addition, they had before them a series of Papers on the subject prepared in several of the Government Departments in the year 1920. These included Memoranda by the General Staffs of the three Services, as well as a very complete Report prepared in 1920 by the Home Ports Defence Committee on the safeguards to be imposed from a -defensive point of view, if the tunnel should be built, and the considered opinions of a number of Ministers. Memoranda on the commercial and transport aspects of the scheme were furnished on the present occasion by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Transport respectively. Finally, the Committee of Chiefs of Staff met a few days before the main Committee, and furnished a Joint Report on the military aspects of the problem. They supplemented this Report by verbal state-ments at the meeting.Thus the Committee had before them, not only the views of their predecessors, but a series of Memoranda on the latest aspects of the project, prepared in the light of war experience and post-war conditions. There was, therefore, no side of the question on which the fullest possible information was not available.I think that most of those present, like myself, had approached the subject with a certain pre-disposition in favour of the Channel Tunnel. When the evidence came to be discussed, however, it was found that everyone had been forced to an opposite conclusion. The advice of the staffs of the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry was against the project. While the scheme offered very slight attractions from a military point of view, it was found to involve considerable military disadvantages.From the point of view of security, the Committee of Imperial Defence do not wish to overstate the risk. But they are advised, as their predecessors were advised, that there is unquestionably an element of danger involved. While naval and military opinion in the past has differed considerably as to the extent of this danger, there appears no room for doubt that the existence of a tunnel would be bound to add something to the anxieties of those responsible for national defence, to our commit-ments, and to our expenditure.And, as pointed out by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. in a statement on the subject in this House in 1907 : &quot; Even supposing the military dangers involved were to be amply guarded against, there would exist throughout the country a feeling of insecurity which might lead to a constant demand for increased expenditure, naval and military, and a continued risk of unrest and possibly alarm, which, however unfounded, would be most injurious in its effect, whether political or commercial.&quot;The Committee were also advised that, if ever the tunnel was built, Government ownership would tend to facilitate the taking of measures whether for its security or destruction.Having examined the defence aspects of the question, the Committee turned to its civil aspects, in order to ascertain Whether there were overriding advantages which would justify them in advising that the military risks involved should be run.The Committee were informed that the construction of the Channel Tunnel would have but little effect on the foreign trade of this country. The question of passenger traffic is alone important, and by it the Channel Tunnel Scheme as a commercial -enterprise must stand or fall.   If, however, the tunnel, when completed, succeeded
APPENDIX III.Extract from the &quot; Times,&quot; dated January 3, 1929. To the Editor of the &quot; Times.&quot;Sir,IN view of the resuscitation of the Channel Tunnel question, it may be of interest to relate the purport of a conversation with the late Lord French shortly after his return from France on relinquishing the command of the British Expeditionary Force in the Great War. I asked him whether he maintained his -opinion concerning a Channel Tunnel in view of his recent experiences. His reply was in the negative, as he said that formerly he had not sufficiently appreciated either the effective transportation or the extreme mobility of sea-power. It will be recollected that our base had to be changed, both suddenly and rapidly, soon after contact with the Germans had been established. He further informed me that if a Channel Tunnel had been in existence at the beginning of the war it would have affected the strategy of the operations consequent on the retreat from Mons. In his opinion, the tunnel would have had to be destroyed when the Allied armies were driven back by the Germans, or would have anchored his army to the west and permitted of the wedge being driven in between the French and English armies, which was an objective of the Germans. He remarked also that with a Channel Tunnel in existence it would constitute one of the terms to be demanded by an enemy in any unfavourable negotiations.History relates how British troops have repeatedly fought on the Continent and shows how certain areas, for strategic and topographical reasons, inevitably constitute the battlefields.I am, Sir, &amp;e,CECIL B. LEVITA.6, Brunswick Square, Horn, January 1.in attracting passenger traffic to the extent which its promoters hope for, one result would be the gradual disappearance of the cross-Channel steamship services.As regards relief to unemployment, the Parliamentary Committee estimate that on the tunnel itself about 2,500 men would find employment on the English side, and an equal number on the French side of the Channel. There would, in addition, be consequential employment elsewhere, and one of the estimates in the memorandum of the Channel Tunnel Committee was for an over-all figure of 12,000 workers in Great Britain and 12,000 in France.The Committee of Imperial Defence were unanimous that the advantages of the Channel Tunnel were not commensurate with the disadvantages from a defence point of view. Further, they took the view that all that has happened in the last five years in the way of naval, military and air development has tended, without exception, to render the Channel Tunnel a more dangerous experiment.That was the unanimous opinion of the Committee of Imperial Defence, who accordingly recommended that at the present time the Channel Tunnel ought not to be proceeded with.In view of this, the Government had no alternative but to accept the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence.
