DOOflHENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIO MAJEST.Y1 S GOVERNMENT.T 00 PY NO 2 &apos; _039) *CABINET.MINERS&apos; WELFARE FUND AND DISTRESS. Note- by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate a Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secreta: of the Mines Department on the question of using the Miners1 Welfare Fund for the relief of distress.    I agree, v/ith his conclusions.P.0-L.Board of Trade,15th January, 1939.
The Government will probably have to state their attitude in the near future to the question of using money from the Liners&apos; Welfare Fund for the relief of distress.    The question has been raised in several newspapers and in other quarters.    Copies of three letters on the subject, one from the Duke of Northumberland, are attached.Generally the view advanced is  (l) that it is much more important, in present conditions, to provide food and clothing than to provide &quot;luxuries&quot; like welfare institutes, pithead baths, etc., and (2) that there is moreover an unexpended balance of about  2,000,000 in the Fund which is not being used even for the &quot;luxuries&quot;.The Duke of Northumberland even suggests that the existence of the Welfare Fund is shutting the pockets of private charity.I have been impressed for some time by the point that it is rather absurd for me to have to collect a levy for welfare purposes from collieries which are having the greatest difficulty in finding money to keep their men employed and pay the wages, and I had been considering the question of inviting Parliament to suspend the levy for a year, on the ground that it would save the industry about  1 million at a time of great difficulty, without interfering with the progress of the welfare work, which could be financed out of the accumulated balance in hand or by anticipating the levy of subsequent years.That however is a different question, and one which I think&apos; is now overshadowed by the later question, viz: of using Welfare money for the relief of distress.The position as ,regards this question is as follows :-There is in fact an unexpended balance in hand on accountcf the V/elfare Fund of about  2 million.    Nearly  600,000 of this represents the Pithead Baths Fund, made up of the Royalties &quot;F&apos;e2 y?e-   -1- : - -&apos;
Levy under the Mining Industry Act, of 1926, with certain additioffi-^^ which have been made by the Miners1 Welfare Committee from the ordinary Welfare Fund.It will be convenient to consider this Baths Fund separately from the ordinary Welfare Fund.The unexpended balance in the latter amounts to about  l^million. Of this nearly  f- million is already earmarked for approved schemes, viz:   375,000 for local schemes and the balance for Education, Research, etc.     The unallocated balance is about  800,000. Even this sum, however, is not &quot;free&quot; in the sense which the public appear to assume.     About  700,000 of it is on account of the District Funds and represents the ^ths portion of the levy-payments which under the Act; are bound to be spent in the district from which the payment was made; and the proportions in which this balance belongs to the several dis-tricts vary very greatly.      Some districts have spent their welfare money up to the hilt, - and even overspent it - and have no balance to their credit.   South Wales is one.    Others have gone more slowly with their plans and have accumulated balances for future expenditure as their schemes develop.    Durham is one of these, their intention being in due course to provide a district convalescent home on similar lines to those already provided in South Wales and other districts.Any grant therefore from this  700,000 to relieve distress in South Wales would be out of the Welfare-pockets of other districts, such as Durham, and would result in penalising those districts whose Welfare Schemes lie in the future in favour of those who have spent their welfare money already.This is true not only as between districts, but also as between different parts of the same district.     As a matter of &quot;domestic&quot; arrangement the District Committees in some Districts (including South Wales) have in fact sub-divided their districts into smaller units and earmarked a proportionate part of their district funds for each sub-district..   Some sub-districts have spent their money very fully;others have waited.    3ven the unallocated sum standing to the credit of any given district in practice belongs only to certain parta of it.There remains a sum of about  125,000 (part of the  800,000) which I   stands to the orcdit of the General Fund which is used mainly for-2-
Research and non-district Education Schemes.This Fund and the Jiaths Fund are free from any condition as to the district or districts in which it must be spent, and no district therefore has any prescriptive right to any portion of either of them.The use of the Baths Fund, however, is subject to other difficulties.   As compared with the original fund it is still in its infancy.    The original fund has been in operation for 7 years or so, and it is possible to say (subject to the points already made) what is the lag be Ween collection and expenditure With the Baths Fund it is different.    The Committee have purposely spent the first two years in experimenting and laying their plans.    It is only recently that their main programme has begun.    This programme covers the next four years and is designed to absorb the whole of their receipts on Baths Fund account during that time.    They have now got some way with the beginning of it; the lag of the first two years is expected soon to be overtaken and expenditure more or less to keep pace with receipts,    Actual contractual obligations already accepted absorb over  200,000, and moral commitments to collieries absorb not only the remainder of the present balance in hand but anticipate future receipts as well.    In other words any grant from their present balance will curtail the programme of the next four years on which they have definitely embarked.The only sum which is free from any of the difficulties mentioned above is the sum of about  125,000 which is to the credit of the General Fund.    The General Fund, as already stated, is used mainly for Research and Education schemes. Judging by past years, the future revenues of this fund could
ordinarily be made sufficient to meet future calls upon it,  and their existing unspent balance could,  if necessary, &quot;be appropriated for relief of distress without doing any violence either to the prescriptive rights of the different districts, or to commitments already entered into, or to the normo,l progress of the Welfare programe.This is not true of any other part of the  2,000,000. The position may he summarised as follows:-(1) On Baths Fund account there is no balance in handwhich is superfluous to the programme already laid down and begun. Any grant from this Fund must be at the expense of Baths already projected. (2) On Welfare ITund account nearly  7 5 0 , 000 of the unspent balance of  If million is already earmarked and could not he used for relief except at the expense of Schemes already projected. (3) There is however in this account a &quot;lag&quot; between collection and allocation now amounting to about  800*000 which could be used for relief of distress without interfering with any schemes at present approved.(4) Apart from the differing proportions in which this 800,000 (or  700,000 of it) &quot;belongs&quot; to different districts,  one could go further and se-y that its use for relief of distress would not interfere with the normal progress of future welfare schemes, at any rate for 3 or 4 years when the levy ceases. Vihen that time comes there is likely, as matters now stand, to b a balance of say  800,000 to  1,000,000 still availabl for welfare schemes.    If that balance is taken now,  it will not,  oeteris paribus,  be available then.
(5) The fact however that the  700,000 in fact &quot;belongs&quot; in much larger proportion to some districts than to others (and indeed to the exclusion of some)    makes it very difficult to use it for all or any districts impartially, unless all districts agree, which is very unlikely,(6) There is only about  125,000 (on General Fundaccount) which neither is already earmarked nor belongs to any one district more than another. For 1,000,000 persons this would provide 2/6d,per head.(?) To use any part either of the Baths Fund or of the Welfare Fund would require an Act of parliament.(8) All the indications are that the miners would oppose it.    Not only do they attach great importance to the present purposes of the funds, but they also have designs upon it, or some part of it, for pensions.Those are the &quot;tacts&quot; .My own comments are these:-In addition to the necessity of legislating, there are many more difficulties in releasing any part - and particularly any, substantial part - of the Welfare moneys than the. public realise,The Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund has a large sum of money in hand -certainly over half a million when the grant due from the Government is included - and more than it contemplates spending this winter, Money is still coming in so that it is clear that if money were granted now from the Welfare Fund it would not be spent now but would remain in the P,iind till next Autumn or later.I suggest    therefore that this Government need take no steps to divert money from the Welfare Fund and that the
answer to any criticism of its attitude is that nearly all the 7elfare money is already earmarked in one way or another for schemes which are of great and &quot;permanent&quot; value to the industry, and that having regard to the amount of money which is already being provided for relief, it is unnecessary now to contemplate any interference with the important work which the Welfare Fund is doing for the industry.H.

COPY/DKAlnwick Castle.December 15th, 1928.My dear Prime.Minister,I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of December 13th, 1928, enclosing a letter- which has been written to all Lords Lieutenant in England and Wales with regard to the relief of distress in the coalfields.I am very grateful to you for letting me know what action you are taking, and I will do my best to co-operate In the national effort.    I am connunicating with the Lord Mayor of Newcastle In regard to the matter,    I do not think that any object will be served by setting up a separate Committee for Northumberland, as the Newcastle Committee will cover the ground.    I will, however, take whatever- action seems desirable in order to raise funds in the County.May I be allowed to point out that the fact that there is a very large balance in the Miners   Velfare Fund acts as a serious deterrent to the liberality of the public.    In a County such as this, where industrial depression has existed for so long,  it is difficult to raise money even for the most deserving object;   but that difficulty is increased ten-fold when the public know that very large sums of money are being expended in providing pit-head baths, recreation grounds, etc., etc., for collieries which in many cases are working short time, on borrowed money, and can only continue to exist owing to the forbearance of creditors and of the Royalty Owners, who are foregoing their royalties either In whole or in part.    In such circumstances the public cannot but feel that the money which has been abstracted in one form or another from the Industry, and has therefore aggravated its condition, should be expended in relieving the present distress rather than on objects which are of less vital Importance.yours sincerely,3d.

COPY/DHCELTIC COLLIERIES, LIMITED.A. A. Doorly,36, Plymouth Road, Penarth.21 Merchants Exchange Buildings, Bute Docks,CARDIFF.14th December, 1928..Capt. Arthur Evans, &amp;.P., House of Commons, LONDON.Dear Capt. Evans,MINERS&quot; WELFARE FUND.I enclose extract from the &quot;Western Mail&quot; of yesterday for your perusal, and have spoken to many of my friends on the matter, but the opinion seems to be that as the Fund was enacted by Act of Parliament, it is tied up to certain objects, into which the starvation and want of clothes of the miners themselves do not enter.This consideration however, does not appear to have entered Into the mind of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when it was considered necessary to commandeer the Roads Fund,* I believe that the initiation of the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund was due to the great agitation made to provide the miners with baths at the pithead, but I do not think much of the Fund has been devoted to this object, and their welfare could certainly be bettered in the most useful way by devoting a proportion of the Fund to relieving their present distress, and I commend this view to your attention.I am,Yours faithfully,Sd.   A.A. Doorly.
9 A 9 warncofy/dhWestern Mail   13/12/23.MINERS1  W&amp;LFARS FUND.Sir, - Vfi.ll it be out of place now to aalc what the MinersT Welfare Fund is doing to help the miners and their families who are suffering so much in these hard times?     I understand that this fund has  2,000,000 in hand, and surely some of this would be better spent in feeding and finding boots for the miners&apos; children than making pleasure grounds for football, tennis, bowls, &amp;c, costing thousands of pounds, in little oountry villages.     And, so far, I have not been able to ascertain how much help has been received from the Miners1 Federation. - I am, &amp;c,A SUFFERER.
