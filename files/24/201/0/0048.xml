Efts SeooraUu:? ^r iTor-igu fcQMrr&quot;[This Document is the Pr-o^riy-oWijg Britannic Majesty^ Government.]NORTH AMERICA.Ay^,    r- ,n^%A February 19, 1929.CONFIDENTIAL:    ^O^^--f,^^&apos;   &quot;    &apos;Section 1.[A 1228/12/45]    ... No. 1.Sir Austen Chamberlain to Sir E. Howard (Washington). &quot; (No. 314.) &apos; &apos;Sir, Foreign Office, February 19: 1929.: THE American Ambassador called upon me to-day upon the pretext, or with the object, of ascertaining whether anything more could now be said as to the date at which the British Empire would ratify the Kellogg Pact.Having disposed of this question, he went on to refer to the speech delivered by the Prime Minister last night at the banquet to celebrate the opening of the British Industries Fair. Mr. Houghton said he was speaking purely personally, but he had been impressed by a sentence in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in which he had spoken of his hope that the day would come in the world when, if two nations wanted to fight, there would be some nation which would tell them to &quot;move on.&quot; The Ambassador said that this phrase had struck him the more because it seemed to correspond with the turn which his own thoughts had been taking. At present we had in the world a machinery by which, if war broke out, the nations would be convoked in council and would endeavour to reach a decision as to which of the belligerents was the aggressor, but in the meantime the war would go on. The position seemed to him very much as if when a house was burning the authorities should sit down to consider whether the fire was due to a gas explosion or an over-heated flue instead of immediately taking measures to put out the conflagration. The Prime Minister&apos;s speech had appeared to point to some more immediate and practicable step, such, for instance, as an embargo on all trade with both the belligerent nations until it had been discovered which was the innocent party, when the embargo might be lifted in his favour.I told Mr. Houghton that I had had no conversation with the Prime Minister about his speech either before or since it was delivered. I thought it must be taken, however, rather as an indication of the trend of his thoughts than as intended to point to any particular proposal. I record the conversation only because Mr. Houghton gave me to understand that he hopes to find an opportunity of suggesting some such policy as this to President Hoover.In the course of further conversation I repeated to the Ambassador what I told him must already be within his knowledge, namely, that we were engaged in a serious and careful study of the problems that affected our relations with the United States. Neither the Draft Arbitration Treaty which they had submitted to us, nor the problem of naval limitation could be discussed without reference to the further problem of belligerent rights, and Mr. Houghton would, of course, recognise how deeply the roots of that question penetrated into our history and affected a body of doctrine which had been held in common by all parties in the State. Naturally, we needed time for the consideration of such grave issues, and even when we ourselves had reached conclusions we could not proceed without consultation with the other Governments of the Commonwealth. It must, therefore, be some time before we could make any proposals to the United States, but I, at any rate, was encouraged by the result of our enquiries to believe that the differences between us were not very great, though in some respects important, and were certainly not of a kind on which agreement, even if in part it were agreement to differ, could not be reached.Mr. Houghton said he entirely shared this view, and added that in his own country he did not think that there was any feeling of tension about our relations. He went on to speak of Mr. Borah&apos;s resolution for the codification of maritime law, which he anticipated would be carried, though probably neither in the present session nor in the special session which would have to be summoned for other business as soon as the new Administration entered upon office.I told him that for my part I dreaded a proposal to call an international cqn-ference for this purpose, even if the codification were limited strictly to recording the existing state of the law. I thought it would be very difficult to secure agree-ment, for the difference between what I might call the continental. view and the American view was much greater than the difference between the American view and our own.   It seemed to me, therefore, extremely unlikely that the conference
could be successful, and there was even less probability of success if its scope were enlarged to embrace the consideration not of what the law is but of what the law ought to be. In any case, I should most earnestly deprecate the summoning of a conference unless it had been ascertained by previous conversations that there was a sufficient basis of agreement to give it the probability of success.Mr. Houghton again expressed his agreement. He observed that America was not likely to set much value by the opinions on this subject of countries like Roumania, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland. The only possible basis would be an agreement between the United States, ourselves and Japan, with the possible addition of the Mediterranean Powers. I replied that I should like the first step to be a confidential discussion between the United States and ourselves as being the two greatest naval Powers and as having founded their existing practice upon the same principles of law and largely upon the same decisions, whether given in our own Admiralty Courts or in the Supreme Court of the United States.Mr. Houghton observed that he thought the new American Administration would require time for consideration and would proceed slowly and cautiously, and he fully recognised that the forthcoming elections in this country might make it necessary to delay the opening of the conversations just as the change of Government imposed some delay upon the United States.. I am, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
