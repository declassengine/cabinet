Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1929.SECRET. Copy No.       28CP 17 (29).CABINET.WASHINGTON HOURS CONVENTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.THE Cabinet will remember that in February 1928 (in accordance with Cabinet Authority Cabinet 4 (28), Conclusion 3) the British Govern-ment representative on the Governing Body of the International Labour Office made a formal proposal for the revision of the Washington Hours Convention. Various questions of procedure had to be settled before anything in the nature of a decisive vote could be taken on this proposal, but at its next ensuing Session (to be held in Geneva on the 11th and 12th March) the Governing Body will be called upon to decide whether or not there is a prima facie case for the revision of the Convention. A positive decision will lead to further consultation of the States Members of the Organisation, and will in practice amount to an endorsement of the proposal. A negative result will finally dispose of our proposal and will revive the question of ratifying the Convention in its unrevised form.It is my considered opinion that we should continue to press for revision in accordance with our declared policy. My colleagues will realise the position in which we shall find ourselves if we do not do so, or if in any case the decision goes against us. The Washington Convention will once again hold the field. France has already registered her ratification of this Convention to come into operation on ratification by Germany and ourselves. Germany has introduced legislation designed to carry out the terms of the Convention, and I understand that the new German Government is about to declare its readiness to ratify the Convention unconditionally as soon as that legislation has been passed. Belgium has already ratified without conditions. In these circumstances we shall be more than ever accused of preventing, by our refusal to ratify the Washington Convention, any chance of real progress towards an inter-national settlement of the hours question, while at home the subject will remain a source of trouble for future Governments, as it has been for their predecessors.It is clear, therefore, that defeat on this occasion will involve us in serious embarrassment both at home and abroad.During the discussions that have already taken place at Geneva on this question of revision, the objection has been raised, both by the workers&apos; group and by certain of the Government representatives, that we have given insufficient indication of the points on which we should like to see the Convention amended, and those who have taken this line have stated that they will not agree to any general proposal for revision without having a reasonably clear idea of the nature and extent of the alterations at which it is aimed. While, of course, we cannot be expected to enumerate in detail the amendments that we should wish in due course to propose, I am convinced that we shall not succeed in carrying our point without formulating our objections to the Washington Convention in a more precise form than we have so far done. &quot;I have already discussed provisionally with the Foreign Secretary the possibility of taking diplomatic action between now and March, to secure, if possible, support . [18794]
for our point of view from the French and German Governments, and perhaps from others of the Governments represented on the Governing Body. Support thus obtained will be of great value. ..To sum up, my suggestions are: first, that we are bound to maintain our present policy of pressing for the revision of the Washington Convention, and, secondly, that we ought to do all that we properly can, both by preparing the ground beforehand and by our tactics at the meeting itself, to secure a decision in our favour.Ministry of Labour, January 28, 1929.(Initialled) A. S.-M.
