ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.Extract from a Private and Confidential Letter from Sir E. Howard toSir Austen Chamberlain.Circulated by direction of the Secretary op State for Foreign Affairs.Washington, January 25, 1929.*Jfr A!&apos; 4f- *if* -I/-w -ft- w TP .5. What I would therefore like particularly now to emphasise is this. From all conversations I have had recently with leading men here, I have no hesitation in saying that there is really an earnest desire among all those who count for a settlement of the question, for the elimination of all fear of naval competition, and for the establishment on a sound basis of Anglo-American friendship. I do not mean in a hands-across-the-seas spirit which is now a good deal out of date, but in a spirit of &quot; enlightened self-interest &quot; on both sides.6. The one essential condition for the success of an agreement en regie or for a &quot; Gentleman&apos;s agreement &quot; to limit naval construction for some years to come to the status quo, allowing only for replacements, is, according to each one of the men who have spoken to me within the last two months on the subject, that the negotiations should be confided to statesmen and not any more to naval experts. The men who have spoken to me include besides minor lights such leaders of public opinion here as President Coolidge, Secretary Kellogg, Senators Borah and Swanson, Mr. Dwight Morrow, Mr. Reuben Clark, Assistant Secretary of the State Department, Mr. Walter Lippmann, editor of the New York &quot; World,&quot; Mr. Ogden Reid, owner of the &quot; Herald-Tribune,&quot; &amp;c, &amp;c.7. The fact is that there is now here a real atmosphere of willingness to come to reasonable terms and a desire to be friends. It seems to me it is up to us to make up our minds whether we will strike while the iron is hot, or allow this moment of opportunity to pass.8. I cannot help feeling that, if in the course of next autumn, after the General Elections, His Majesty&apos;s Government would send over here some really important statesmen, who would command respect and confidence both in England and America, to establish personal contacts and to talk the matter over with Mr. Hoover and his Secretary of State, whoever he may be, an arrangement re naval construction might be come to without great difficulty and in a comparatively short time.9. As regards belligerent rights at sea, however, no doubt careful previous preparation would be required.   I hope that this may be possible, but we shall see.10. As regards previous preparation for conferences, I was interested to hear from Massey that Senator Swanson, talking to him about the naval question, said that, of course, any further conference must be preceded by private conversations to prepare the ground or it was bound to be a failure.Foreign Office, S.W. .1,February 7, 1929.4754.
