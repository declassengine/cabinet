[This Docoment is the Property of,His Britannic Majesty&apos;g Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1920.9 A *SECRET. Copy No.   28CP. 30 (29).CABINET.THE POSITION OP THE  COUNSELLORS OP  STATE  IN RELATIONTO DOMINION MATTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State fob Dominion Affairs.I THINK it desirable that I should circulate to my colleagues a copy of a despatch which I received on the 2nd February from the Irish Free State Government, and a copy of my reply forwarding a memorandum on the position of the Counsellors of State in relation to Dominion matters.It will be seen that the Irish Free State despatch raises further difficulties in regard to the ratification in respect of the Free State of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War. We had hoped that the difficulties which that Government had felt to the preparation of an instrument of ratification in the normal&apos; manner in respect of the Free State had been removed by the memorandum which I circulated with CP. 24 (29). It appears, however, that they still wish to press their objections to the competence of the Counsellors to act on behalf of His Majesty in Dominion matters, and in view of the importance of securing the ratification of the treaty in respect of all parts of the Empire before the 4th March, I deemed it necessary to reply to the Free State Government&apos;s arguments at once. I accordingly had a memorandum prepared in which the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Home Secretary concurred, and this statement was communicated to the Free State Government on the 6th February.I should add that I made use of many of the ai*guments which appear in the statement in the course of a conversation which 1 had with Mr. Smiddy, the new High Commissioner for the Irish Free State, on the 5th February, the day of his arrival in London to take up his appointment. 1L. S. A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, February 8, 1929.D. 5648 G.Despatch No. 35.   (Confidential.) Department of External Affairs,Sir, Irish Free State, February 1, 1929.WITH reference to your despatch No, 35, Confidential, of the 23rd January, regarding the Ratification of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War, I have the honour to inform you that the approval of the Dail and Senate has to be obtained before His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State advise His Majesty to sign the instrument of ratification. The two houses of the Oireachtas meet on the 20th February. The instrument will be forwarded within the next ten days so that it may be at hand for signature when the approval of the Oireachtas has been obtained and notification given by wire.2.   In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State have had under consideration your telegram Circular A. No. 59 of the 4th December and your despatch Dominions No. 580 of the 11th December, 1928, concerning the [18852]
oppointment of Counsellors of State:&apos; They believed&apos; at the time of the appointment that His Majesty&apos;s illness&apos;would not prevent the exercise of his ordinary duties for more than five or six weeks, and they deferred advising His Majesty to sign any instruments until the stage of convalescence had been reached. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State now regret to learn that that stage may not be reached for another month or two. The Counsellors of State were hot presumably intended to function in matters concerning the Governments of the British Commonwealth other than that of Great Britain. They were appointed by His Majesty, on the advice of the Privy Council in Great Britain, through an Executive Act of the British Government. If it had been intended to appoint Counsellors who should act on His. Majesty&apos;s. behalf in respect of His Majesty&apos;s other Governments, the latter would have been consulted and His Majesty would no doubt have been advised to appoint as Counsellors Members of the Royal Family exclusively. Such an appointment on the common advice of all his Governments would have been in strict accordance with the spirit of the Imperial Conference report of 1926.     , - ,  -3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State fully understand how difficult it was for His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain to estimate the probable duration of His Majesty&apos;s illness at the time of the appointment of the Counsellors, and they do not, therefore, wish to urge the reconstitution of the Regency body in order to meet the needs of the other Governments of His Majesty.&apos; On the other hand they cannot accept the signature of the Counsellors in lieu of His Majesty&apos;s signature in matters concerning the Trish Free State, and they accordingly intend to advise&quot;His; Majesty, if it is reasonably possible, to sign or initial documents presented to hiim by them, or, in case the signature or initialling cannot be effected withoirt causing fatigue to His Majesty, to&apos;&quot;appoint Her Majesty the Queen, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and His Royal Highness the Duke&apos;:^ 9&quot;f\;&quot;ybrki/;^s&apos;,&apos;His, Majesty&apos;s representatives, to sign such documents on his behalf.       .;.  &apos;  ;v &apos;   *. , &apos;     &apos; \    &quot;&apos; * I have, &amp;o. &quot;&apos; &quot;-&apos;   &apos; &apos; -\ nl&quot;J*&apos; &apos;  &apos; &apos;   &apos;(Signed) P. McGILLIGAN,   &apos; 1 &apos;      &apos;Minister for External&apos;Affairs.The Right Honourable the Secretary of State , for Dominion Affairs, Downing Street, London, S.W. I.Irish Free&apos;State.(No. 63.   Confidential.)Sir, . Downing Street, February 6, 1929.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 35, Confidential, of the 1st February, regarding the ratification of the Treaty for the renunciation of war, and to enclose a memorandum dealing with the points as to the position of the Counsellors of State raised in your despatch. A copy of this memorandum has been sent to Mr. Smiddy, with whom I had an opportunity of discussing the matter in all its aspects on the 5th February.2. It is hoped that, in view of the considerations advanced in the rnemo-randum, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State will see their way to approve of the instrument being prepared in the normal way for signature by the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York as Counsellors of State on behalf Of His Majesty.3. It is understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State are considering the suggestion which has been put forward with a view to enabling the simultaneous deposit of ratifications in respect of all parts of the British Commonwealth to take place before the 4th March, viz., that they should at once advise signature on behalf of His Majesty of the instrument of ratification on the distinct understanding that the instrument will not be deposited at the State Department at Washington until instructions to that effect have been sent by the. Free State Government to the Free State Charge d&apos;Affaires at Washington with al notification that the Resolution has passed the Oireachtas.
,,,,4 , Mr. Smicldy will no doubt be able to advise . the,Free State Government as to the degree of importance which1 the United States Government attach to the Treaty coining into foroe before the 4th of March. .,,........ . .. &apos;        I have, &amp;c.   ,&apos;  . /; ,!/(&quot;&apos; .  ,  (Signed) L. S. AMBRY.The Minister for External Affairs, &quot;Irish Free State.&apos; , .. .Memorandum.The appointment by the King of the Royal and other personages to perform certain functions on His Majesty&apos;s behalf was made in accordance with the only constitutional forms which in the circumstances were available for the purpose, and in accordance with tradition. Whether any alteration of the procedure is desirable in order to bring it into accord with modern constitutional developments would seem to be a matter which could properly be discussed at the next Imperial Conference if any Dominion desired to raise it, and any alteration could only be made with general agreement after such discussion.Under the terms of their appointment, the Counsellors are to approve and sign, on His Majesty&apos;s behalf, any document requiring His Majesty&apos;s signature and to do, on His behalf, any matter or thing which appears to them necessary or expedient to do on His behalf in the interests of the safety and good government, of the Realm, with certain reservations which are not material to the consideration, of the present question, and with the further reservation that they are not to act, in any matter or thing on which it is signified by His Majesty or appears to them! that His Majesty&apos;s special approval should be previously obtained.The power thus delegated to the Counsellors is, subject to these reservations, power to do anything which His Majesty can do, but it must of course be exercised in the constitutional manner in which the King himself would exercise it. The acts which the Counsellors of State may do and the documents which they may sign are such acts and documents as His Majesty would have done or signed if he had not been stricken with illness, that is to say, such acts and documents as His Majesty would have been advised to sign by his responsible Ministers. The Counsellors of State, therefore,, following the constitutional doctrine, can only act, when dealing with matters which concern either the Irish Free State or any other Dominion, upon the advice given to them by the Ministers of the Dominion concerned.If His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State should see fit to advise that any document should be reserved until the King is able to deal with it personally, it would follow that the particular document in question would not receive the signature of the Counsellors of State and it would be reserved until such time as His Majesty&apos;s personal approval could be obtained. ,It has been suggested that misapprehension might arise if documents concerning any Dominion received the signature of persons holding office in His: Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom or other offices of State in England inasmuch as it might be suggested that in affixing their signature these Ministers or officers were acting in an executive capacity in the affairs of that Dominion. It appears unnecessary to discuss this question because, as the Free State Govern-ment are aware, it has been arranged that, in order to avoid even the appearance of such an infringement of the constitutional doctrine, documents relating to any Dominion shall, during His Majesty&apos;s illness, be signed by Her Majesty the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York and not by any one of the other three Counsellors of State.A further most important consideration is that any alteration of the present arrangements would require submission to the King persoually. The action which His Majesty took in circumstances of great urgency and difficulty was intended by him to provide adequate machinery to enable all his constitutional functions to be performed during his illness.His Majesty&apos;s health is now so far improved that it has been possible for him to sign two documents which the authority delegated to the Counsellors of State did not enable them to sign, but if the King were to be asked to sign documents which it is within the authority of the Counsellors of State to sign it would be necessary to lay the whole position before him; and the King is still so seriously
ill that it would be imphsdble&apos;td!explaiB-(the veryodiffioult constitutional questions-raised in-the Free State despatch and to take His Majesty&quot;speasure thereonThe Counsellors of State have acted on His Maiesty&apos;s behalf in matters relating to all the other Dominions, on the advice in each case of the Dominion Government concerned (including the signature of the instruments of ratnfication of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War in respect of other Dominions) and no other Dominion has raised any question as to the authority for, or propriety of,, such action.
