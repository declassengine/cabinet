(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AM NIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT). SECRETCABIN EJJ.CqP.9. (29). -; C&apos; VISCOUNT CECIL OF CHELWOODrS ROAD VEHICLESREGULATION BILL 1928,Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.The motion for the Committee stage of this Bill in the House of Lords io down for the 22nd January.In the discussion on the 2nd reading of the Bill there was a strong feeling in every quarter of the House that a measure dealing with the further regulation of motor traffic Is urgently necessary.      Press comments on the discussion were generally In the same direction. The Government position was that while legislation is required it is necessary to await the report of the Royal Commission on Transport, and Lord Salisbury advised the House not to oppose the 2nd reading4on the understanding that &quot;either this matter will be referred to the Royal Commission with a view to an early report, or if that fails, it will go to a Select Committee&quot;.I subsequently referred the question of an interim report on the subjects dealt with in Viscount Cecilrs Bill to the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Transport (Sir Arthur Griffith-Bosoawen) who has replied &quot;The Commission proposes to call for certain additional evidence bearing directly upon the subject of Lord Ceoill3 Bill and hopes to be in a position to present, before Parliament adjourns in the following summer, an interim report dealing more particularly with the matters covered by the Regulation of Road Vehicles Bill and by part (1) of the draft Road Traffic Bill&quot;.Lord Londondery has acquainted Viscount Cecil with the terms of the Chairman&apos;s reply and Lord Cecil has replied &quot;I am suitably grateful for BoscawenJs promise of an Interim report *before Parliament adjourns&apos;, but as that is not to be

Meanwhile, the tale of death and injury goes on.1   Surely something might be done before thon and I hope the Government will be able to make some reassuring statement&quot;.It must be agreed that the necessity for taking steps to reduce the loss of life upon the roads is urgent.     Lord Londondery has consulted me and we are agreed that It is most desirable that he should be in a position to make a statement in the House of Lords when the motion for the Committee stage of the Bill is brought forward to the effect that if the Government is returned to power after the General Election there will be no avoidable delay in the promotion of legislation dealing with Road Traffic once we have received the Royal Commission^ report.Cabinet sanction is asked.(Intld. )   Wc Ao
