tig DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT.IP RET COPY NO,,   28__P,  36 (29) - CABINET.GAS    legislation memorandum by the President of the Board of TradejThe gas industry, through the National Gas Council (which represents about 90% of the total sales of gas in the United. Kingdom), has for some time been pressing for legislation to give it greater freedom than it now has under existing legislation,, This legislation, apart from the Gas Regulation Act 1920, dates from the middle of the last century and restricts the amount of capital which&apos;may he raised or borrowed, the rates of dividend which may be paid and the price of gas which may be charged3 and imposes other similar restrictions which were deemed necessary because of the position which a gas undertaking then held as a virtually unchallenged monopoly.In view of the importance of the industry to the national welfare, and of the changed circumstances with regard to competition the proposals put forward by the Gas Council were referred to the National Fuel and Power Committee for consideration.The Committee reported (Cmd.3252) favourably on most of the proposals in November last, but it was evident that legislation to give effect to the more complicated and controversial of the proposals could not be obtained during the present session.   The Cabinet therefore authorised me (Cabinet 55 (23) Conclusion 5) to prepare in consultation with the Gas Council a non-controversial Bill,    After discussion with representatives of the Gas Council certain proposals have been selected which appear to be non-controversial and which, while not going so far as the industry desires, will to some extent ease its burdens.The draft Bill which I now circulate embodies these proposals. It deals with -
(a) The provision of increased financial facilitiessuch as the power to raise capital and borrow money with the consent of the Board of Trade instead of being required to promote a Bill or special Order (Clause 1, 2 and 5);(b) The removal of a restriction imposed in recentyears at the request of chemical manufacturers as to the amount and source of residual products of gas manufacture which may be purchased for further working up.      This r^elief is agreed to by the chemical manufacturers (Clause 4)j(c) The remedying of certain defects in the Gas RegulationAct 1920  (Clause 8)j(d) An enlargement of the Board of Trade&apos; s powers to dealwith the statutory areas of supply of gas under-takings (clauses 5 and 7);(e) An enlargement of Board of Trade powers to modifyand amend by Special Order the private Acts of a gas undertaking in such manner as parliament may from time to time have a one in special Acts relating to gas undertakings (clause 7). One matter (Clause 6)  is included in the Bill which I consider may now be more suitably and economically effected by general Act than by the compulsory Departmental Orders contemplated under Section 1 (5) of the G-as Regulation Act 1920 This is a provision that all those statutory gas undertakings (except some small ones) which have neglected to apply for power to charge on the basis of number of therms supplied shall be required to charge    on that basis as from an appointed day. This is acceptable to the National Gas Council.The gas industry has pressed with great vigour for legisla tion giving relief from some of its restrictions in the Press, by    circularising members of Parliament, and by speeches of
chairman to their shareholders at annual meetings in the provinces.    The introduction of this Bill, just before the season for the annual meetings of gas companies commences, will go far to relieve the Government from a campaign which may become embarrassing: and it will be of material help to the industry.iIn view of the importance of introducing the Bill as soon as possible, if it is to have a chance at all of passing, this Session.    I have, with the prime Minister&apos;s authority, submitted it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Biinister of Health,  the Attorney-General and the Minister of Transport for their observations, and now submit it to the Cabinet without previous consideration by the Home Affairs Committee for approval of its immediate introduction.?sCi-L.Board of Trade,11th February, 1929.
