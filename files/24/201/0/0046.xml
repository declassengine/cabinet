THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.SECRET.CP.46 (29). IRISH    IMMIGRATIONMemorandum by the/Segretary^of State for Scotland.1. The Home Secretary kindly let me see a draft of theMemorandum on Irish Immigration Which he has submitted to the Cabinet.     I agree with the figures it contains and with the Tables annexed to it.2. As regards Scotland the main facts, as shown from the enquiries which have been made, would appear to be as follows:-In 1928,  to judge by previous years,  it may be estimated that there was an inflow of something like 2,090 persons from the Irish Free State into Scotland.In each of the years 1925-6 and 1926-7 over 800 poor parsons born in the irish Free State befeame chargeable in 43 Scottish Parishes, mainly in the We3t of Scotland.In each of the years 1925, 1926 and 1927 the Irish-bom (covering Northern Ireland as well as the Irish Free State) convicted prisoners, Borstal inmates and Criminal Lunatics amounted to between 22% and 25% of the total for Scotland.In each of the years 1925 and 1926 the number of oon-convictions of persons of irish birth and extraction (including both the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland) .at Glasgow Sheriff Court was about half the number of persons of Scottish birth and extraction similarly convicted.3. In view of theae f&amp;sta I should not be prepared,without further discuosicn,  to agree with the conclusions drawn in the first paragraph of the Home Secretary&apos;a Memorandum, and I should recerve the right to Btate my own views as to policy at the meeting at whioh the matter is cons considered.&apos; JOHN GILMOUR&apos; .Scottish Offioe, Whitehall,S.W.I.21st.
