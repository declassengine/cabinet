MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a telegram from the Government of India containing an appreciation of the political situation in the light cf the meetings which the various Indian political organisations have, according to custom, held during the Christmas period. I circulate also an extract from a private letter from the Viceroy received this week. It covers much the same ground, up to a point, as the official telegram, but I add it as it discloses Lord Irwin&apos;s personal views.I should perhaps explain that.the Moslem Conference referred to in para. 10 of the telegram was a special ad hoc convention summoned under the presidency of the Aga Khan in the hope of closing the breach which the attitude of Mr. Jinnah and his associates towards the Statutory Commission had created in the solidarity of Indian Moslems hitherto presented in the Moslem League.In regard to para. 3 of the telegram, while I have no doubt that a successful prosecution under the existing law for conspiracy against the Government of a considerable number of Communist leaders would be the most effective action against them, an unsuccessful case would be very damaging to Government, and I am impressing on the Government of India the necessity of examining the prospects of success very closely before launching the prosecution, and am also urging on them the importance of taking further powers to deal with the leaders of such movements.My colleagues will observe that the Government of India&apos;s general conclusion is that the political situation has swung considerably to the left in the last year.PEEL.23rd January 192^ .Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,19th January 1929.255 S. Developments in the political situation in India during the last month have been very marked. The most important event was the meeting of the Congress in Calcutta attended by popular demonstrations on very large scale. The principal subject of discussion was the issue between Dominion status as recom-mended in the Nehru Report and independence. Motilal Nehru, the President of the Congress, was committed to the Dominion status ideal by the report which bears his name. The independence movement Avas supported by Sriniyasa Jyengar, Avho wishes to use it for his own personal ends as a weapon against his rival, Motilal Nehru, but mainly by the younger men led by Jawahar Lai Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, who have converted independence from a phrase into a definite movement. Motilal Nehru, finding himself in danger of defeat on an issue which would involve his resignation from Presidentship of Congress, iiwoked the aid of Gandhi, Avho drafted compromising resolution. This resolution proposed to adopt constitution drawn up in Nehru Report, provided it were accepted by end of 1930, but if it were not accepted by that date Congress would promote non-violent non-co-operation by advising country to refuse taxation and every other aid to Government, It was added that nothing in resolution should interfere with propaganda for familiarising people with goal of independence, in so far as it does not conflict with prosecution of campaign for adoption of Nehru Report. This resolution, when discussed in Subjects Committee, was not accepted by supporters of independence, and Gandhi had to propose a modified resolution which substituted end of 1929 for end of .1930 as date after which non-co-operation would be started if Nehru Report had not been accepted by British Parliament, and strengthened reference to propaganda in favour of independence by substituting for words in original resolution following : &quot; Nothing in this resolution shall interfere with carrying on in name of Congress propagada for complete independence.&quot;3400      75   1.29 printed for the Cabinet.      January 1929.SECRET.CP. 12 (29).The Political Situation in India.
2. The resolution &apos; as &apos; thus &quot;amended was accepted in Subjects Committee by Srinivasa Iyengar on behalf of the Independence party; but Jawahar Lai Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose had never attempted to conceal their view that even this was inadequate, and finally in open Congress Subhas Bose opposed the resolution and moved an amendment repudiating Dominion status and laying down independence as India&apos;s goal.   This was lost by 973 against 1,350 votes. ;3. Though the supporters of independence profess not to have been satisfied by the result of the Congress meeting, there is no doubt that the Congress was a great triumph for extremism. An ultimatum which everybody knows cannot be complied with has been given to the British Government, and the Congress have decided unanimously that if it is not complied with after the end of December next they will revive non co operation. This is a definite declaration from which the Congress will find it difficult to go back. It may be that Giandhi and Motilal Nehru and their followers are not anxious to see these developments ; but in view of the commitment they have made, they wilPfind it very difficult to avoid participating in them without a complete break with the extremists, which they are reluctant to face. In any event, the more extreme leaders are unlikely to modify their policy. Gandhi has since tried to tone down his ultimatum and explains that he would be satisfied if the British Government made some definite, serious and sincere move to meet them within the year; but this does not really get him and those who think with him out of the difficulty into which the desire for compromise&apos;with the extremists has got them. He knows that no practical step could be taken which would give him a plausible excuse, having regard to the actual terms of the resolution, for calling off the non-co-operation movement, and that he could not recede without bieaking the Congress and stultifying himself.4. When the idea of independence first emerged last year, it was generally considered visionary and it did not seem likely to develop into a practical issue. In the last few months, however, independence has ceased to be an academic ideal. We are faced now with a party, at present small in number, but active, who, it would seenrij mean to attempt to translate independence into a definite policy, and to organise themselves with a view to attaining their object by force, or at least, to create such widespread unrest in the country that the Government will be intimidated into making sweeping concessions. Youth movements and volunteer organisations are being discussed and supported, and it appears that Jawahar Lai Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose do not mean to stop at Words, but are prepared for action.5. It does not at present appear that they are anxious to launch any large-scale anti-Government movement in the nature of direct action until next year. Their present policy, so far as it can be judged, is to spend the coming year in preparation for rousing anti-Government feeling in every way possible, foster, in their own words, a revolutionary mentality, organise volunteers, exploit, on lines of Bardoli, any specific grievances that may occur in any pa7&apos;t of the country, and generally create an atmosphere favourable to launch of a big mass movement against Government next year. The idea probably is to launch this movement about the time the Simon Commission Report is published, so that all reasonable consideration of the Report inay be rendered impossible, and to reproduce at the beginning of the next Constitutional stage same conditions, in a possibly aggravated form, which rendered the introduction of present reforms a matter of such difficulty. We are at present considering, in consultation with Local Government concerned, whether it is possible and, if possible, expedient to prosecute Jawahar Lai Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and perhaps one or two other leaders in respect of recent speeches.6. The result of Congress meeting would seem to leave Congress divided into three sections : (a) Those who desire independence and are prepared to take active measures towards goal ; (b) a considerable number who have no real objection to independence as an ultimate goal, or are afraid to dissociate themselves from demand, but are not at present prepared or anxious to take steps likely ,to lead to violence; (c) a comparatively small number of persons, such as Malaviya and Mrs. Besant, whose opposition to independence is open and genuine. You will iippi-eciate that any such classification is rough and affected throughout by infinite gradations of meaning which attach to large phrases.7. To conq^lete picture of extreme anti-Government movement it is necessary to say something of Communist activity.   The Indian Communists are perhaps not
very clear about their ultimate object. What they have concentrated on with considerable success-is rousing a spirit uf discontent and lawlessness in the industrial labour population. ;,In Bombay they have succeeded in creating a situation which requires very careful consideration, and it is believed that they contemplate trying to organise a general strike, that is, locally, about May next. In Calcutta, though they have not succeeded in creating the same general unrest among labour, they have been -able to prolong for some months a strike at important Fort Gloster mill, which has no clear reasoned basis. . The large demonstration of labourers under Communist auspices which invaded Congress premises during the Congress sitting in Calcutta is also significant. With important exceptiou of industrial centres Communism has probably made little progress on its own specific lines, and where there are Communists elsewhere whose activities are of any importance, as in the Punjab, there is little to distinguish them from a wing of political extremist party. There is -a tendency for political and Communist revolutionists to join together in so far as both aim at overthrow of constitution, and Jawahar Lai Nehru stands about at meeting points, but there is at the same time profound divez-gence of interests between them.8. We have been considering carefully our general policy in regard to Communism. Apart from the introduction of Public Safety Bill, on which we have aheady -addressed you, we believe that the most effective blow that could be struck against Communist moveznent would be a conspiracy case against sozne 20 of the leaders. No new legislative measures would be likely to be so effective as a successful prosecution of this character. We are telegz-aphing separately azi explanation of the stage at presezrt z-reached. We ai-e about to take the best legal opinion available on the material already collected, azrd if that opinion is favourable it is anticipated that case might be lauziched about the beginnizig of April.9. As a result of developments in Calcutta, the Nehru Repoz-t has lost-much of its iznportance. A meetizig of all-parties convention for the purpose of- ezidorsing the report had been arranged in Calcutta immediately before the Congress. The meeting, however, was a great disappointment to its promoters. While developments in the Congress already described aznonnted to a pz-actical shelving of the report by Hindu extremists, the proceedings of all-parties convention, showed that minority communities were not prepared lo support it, so that it became practically only the programme of less extreme Hindus. Efforts were znade by Mahmudabad and Jinnalz through their unrepresentative All-India Muslim League to obtain concessions in regard to representation of Muslims which znight have enabled them to accept report. The Hindu Mabasabha element, however, refused to agree to concessiozis, and it became plain that no Muslim with any claim to represent community could really subscribe to the report. The Sikhs also broke away. On the other hand the Liberals at their annual meeting at Allahabad upheld the Nehru Report and Dominion status ideal without any mental reservation, but, following their traditional policy of -demanding far more than they really expect, claimed immediate Dominiozi status. There is no doubt that Liberals are seriously perturbed by developments of extremist movement, but there is no indicatiozi that they will be able in any way to influence or control it.10. The attitude of the Muslims, apart from Mahmudabad and Jinnah, who at the momezit stand for little izi the community, has been clarified and unified by the zneeting of All-Parties Muslim Conference in Delhi at the ezid of December, presided over by the Aga Khan. This Conference was representative of nearly all shades of Muslim opinion and iizcluded even the Ali brothers. Feeling has quite definitely haz-dened against Hindu politicians, and Muslim demand has crystallised. This is of great political significance.11. The Siznon Comznission enquiry is having a znarked political effect. It is true that boycotters continue to boycott, but result has been that case of Muslim and other minority communities, depressed classes, and of special intez-ests such as landlords and comznerce, is receiving great prozninence, and moderate Hindu bo3&apos;cotters are probably in their hearts much disturbed, particularly those whose interests are mainly coznmunal like Mahasabha leaders, who may fear that solution will be unduly favourable to Muslims. The logic of evezits tends to drive people either into z-evolutionaz-y activity or into some form of rational discussion of pi-oblem, and it is possible that this tendezicyis working oir some of the more moderate Hindu boycotters. It is important, therefore, to bear in mind possibility that at next stage, when Simozi Comznission Report coznes under discussion, sozne leading Hindus, who have hitherto
held aloof, will be anxious to take part and thus hot lose an opportunity of influencing-result.   It is also not impossible that some of them will visit England this siiramer with the object of placing themselves in touch with British politicians and perhaps with Simon. .. .     -12. The general conclusions on political side seem to be : -(I), That situation has&apos;swung a good deal to the left and contains considerable-potentialities of future trouble. .(2) That a great many people in boycott and opposition camp are not at all happy about position for various reasons indicated above.(3) That Hindu-Muslim tension is unrelieved and perhaps stronger than it was. r\    (4) That no opportunity of detaching moderate opinion, which has been drawn up-by boycott into unnatural association with extremists, should be overlooked.13. The Princes are gravely concerned at trend of-extremist political thought, and1 their attitude may be expected to exert a certain favourable influence in opening. people&apos;s eyes to implications.on Indian development of gospel of independence.Extract from private letter from Lord Irioin to Lord Peel, dated 2nd January 1929.The Christinas oratory of Calcutta has come to an end and leaves a very rmpleasant taste in,.my mouth. lean at present only give you. some rather floating impressions in my mind. There is undoubtedly a noticeable swing to the left. Dominion Status-now almost seems a moderate policy, and 1 have little doubt that it has been one of the objects of the Independence advocates to produce this result. In both camps of Independence and Dominion Status there are, I should fanc3r, a great number of gradations of thought, alb of them again blurred by the invincible preference of Indians for big words over logic and facts. The attitude of nearly everyone too is affected by the idea of bazaar bargaining and putting pressure upon British opinion. But when all this is said and done, we are still left, I think, with the plain fact that things have moved greatly to the left. The Congress resolution approving the principle of hypothetical non-co-operation at the end of this year has greatly disturbed all the Liberal camp, and their feeling I should guess was reflected by Sir Chimanlal Setalvad in his presidential address delivered to the Liberal Federation a few days ago. There is great anxiety too, not only in the Liberal camp, but in a great deal of the Congress camp, over the Socialistic or Communistic appeal which is being made to the younger and hotter Congress heads. Even the All-Parties Convention has failed to give any satisfaction to the Moslems. Thus, although there are several elements of great disunity in the Nationalist ranks, there are considerable possibilities-of trouble from our point of view. It will, I have no doubt, be the purpose of the extremer political and Communist agitators so to guide their respective policies as to facilitate the greatest degree of union between their two forces, and they will no doubt have it in mind to try and bring their joint efforts to a head about the time Simon reports. What, therefore, can we do on the other side ? I do not think there is a great deal at present that we can do on the political side, as that for the moment is out of our hands, except that if and when I get the opportunity I shall consider taking it, of meeting any of the Liberal leaders or possibly Motilal. Conversation with the first would present no great difficulty, and unless 1 am much mistaken they will wish to-assist tis in preventing things getting worse. If I am able in Delhi to meet Motilal,. I should certainly endeavour to persuade him that, from his own point of view, the policy of the Congress resolution is the last word in folly. Whether I should succeed or not is, I suppose, doubtful, for although he will sooner or later have to choose his course between sanity and insanity, he is, like all leaders who are attacked from below, anxious to postpone the date of decision as long as he can. On the economic side my present mind, in advance of my Council discussions that I hope to have next week, is roughly as follows. We should reintroduce the Public Safety Bill, and in doing so make it plain that whether or not we found it necessary to use the powers at once, we thought they would be a valuable deterrent, and we attached importance to them. And I should so lay my plans in the Assembly as to be able to certify it if we were defeated. I should propose to proceed with the Conspiracy case if it turns-out on investigation to be a pretty certain winner. I want further to re-examine all the legal powers that we may possess, either generally or under local Police Acts, for warning, off dangerous persons from the places where they are doing most damage; and, in addition, the general proposal&apos; that you made a little time ago,.
which you are also examining, of proceeding against Indian Communism as such by a frontal attack. &apos; We should also, I think, resort to prosecution of particular speeches or newspaper writing whenever we get such an opportunity. I have, as you know from my earlier correspondence with F.E., been revolving a great deal in my mind whether we can legally or usefully make any direct attack upon the creed of Independence as such, and on those who preach it. I am very doubtful about the wisdom of doing this unless it is so preached as to advocate violent methods, when, of course, it would clearly expose itself to our attack. On the one side, of course, there is the evil flowing from unchecked speech-making in favour of Independence, which is doing great harm ; on the other there is the complete certainty, as it seems to me, that you cannot fill your jails with everybody who proclaims his belief in Independence, and that the only effect of trying to do so at this juncture would be rapidly to enhance the popularity of the cause and thus render the problem more intractable.A great deal will of course depend on the tenour of Simon&apos;s Report, and while it is of course bound to disappoint the extreme left, I do not despair of the possibility of the report and the actions taken in regard to it during the next stages dissipating a good deal of the anti-Government unity that holds the field at present.I had a good deal of talk with Simon when he was here, and I thought he was very sane and balanced. He is feeling the difficulty of the whole thing very much, and I should tremble to think what would happen to the Commission if he went down with illness or was in any other way removed from his directing position. I shall see him again when he conies back to Delhi, when his ideas will no doubt have shaped themselves rather further. He is at present greatly concerned to endeavour to find some means of sparing India a recurrence of these periodic or arbitrary pulling up by the roots of her political life. In this I am certain he is at the root of the matter.I must stop.   I am afraid we cannot look forward to 1929 being a year of peace.
