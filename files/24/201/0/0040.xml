REPORT.Introductory,1. THIS Interim Report does not deal specifically with our main reference on the question of Belligerent Rights at Sea, but only with a cognate subject which was referred to us by the Cabinet at its meeting on the 17th October, 1928 (Cabinet 47 (28), Conclusion 5), namely, the question of the renewal of our Arbitration Treaties which have expired or are about to expire.2. The Root-Bryce General Arbitration Treaty of 1908 expired on the 4th June, 1928, and in March 1928 the draft of a new Treaty Was received from Washington for the consideration of the British Government. While the draft was under consideration by the Cabinet, the Kellogg Pact for the Renunciation of War was proposed. As it cut across the question of the renewal of the Root-Bryce Treaty further examination of the latter was postponed for a while.3. Meanwhile, the Arbitration Treaty with France expired on the 14th October,, though steps have been taken to renew it indefinitely until such time as a new Treaty is negotiated. The Arbitration Treaties with Italy and Spain will expire this, month, and we have at present no Arbitration Treaty with Germany.4. So far as we ourselves are concerned, we should feel no difficulty in renewing these Treaties approximately in their original form. The present difficulty arises owing to the desire of other parties to the Treaties to exclude from the new version the existing reservation of questions involving the &quot; vital interests, the independence, or the honour &quot; of the contracting parties. The draft Treaty forwarded by Mr. Kellogg in March 1928 excludes certain other matters from the scope of the Treaty, such as those within the domestic jurisdiction of either of the high contracting parties, those involving the interests of third parties, the Monroe doctrine, and our commitments under the Covenant of the League of Nations, but does not exclude matters of &quot;vital interest,&quot; The similar exception of &quot;vital interests &quot; has been dropped from the Franco-American Treaty, and. from Treaties concluded between the United States and Albania, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy and Poland, and is likely to be excluded from a number of treaties with other States which are now in course of negotiation. The Foreign Office have also received a private intimation that the French Government ,would be disappointed if His Majesty&apos;s Government asked for a renewal of the Arbitration Treaty on the old terms, and we are satisfied that the United States of America would refuse to renew the Root-Bryce Treaty on those terms.5. It is clear, therefore, that, whether wisely or unwisely, whether as a temporary phase or as a definite stage in the advance of arbitration, the opinion of &quot;the world, under American inspiration, has set against the reservation of &quot; vital interests.&quot; For the British Government, therefore, to refuse to enter on new Arbitration Treaties unless &quot; vital interests &quot; were reserved would be a very serious matter. In view of the attitude of the United States of America, it would, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, amount to a refusal to negotiate any arbitration Treaty with America. Both at home and abroad, it would be represented as a reactionary step running counter to the current of a great world movement. Before taking such a step we felt bound to examine every alternative course, in order to discover which will produce the best results and involve the least risk. In this respect we have received valuable assistance from the Governments of the Dominions.&apos; ;&apos; Q. Before setting forth the various courses open to us, it will be convenient to consider what our own&quot; vital interests &quot; are. In Sir Cecil Hursts memorandum, which was referred to us by the Cabinet (Paper No. B.R. 40), they are described ;as the maintenance of our belligerent , rights at sea, which it has always been &quot;considered unsafe to submit to an international tribunal, and our &quot;special interests&apos;;&apos; in certain.countries due to the necessity of maintaining the safety of our imperial ^ommunicationslf&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;This definition may (or may not), be correct to-day. It.is, however, impossible to foresee where -&quot; vita!interests &quot; may arise in the future.   In[isspif . .. &apos; - ,\:Vv.:r..;-   \-v:.v-&apos; *-&apos;*- - -:: B 2.-&apos;-- . -
the days of sailing-ships, who could have foreseen the vital importance of coal and then oil. Even ten or twelve years ago who could have foreseen the importance of the countries of the Middle East to our imperial air communications ? Who, to-day, would venture to forecast what &quot;vital interests&quot; may arise out of developments in such directions, for example, as aviation, wireless telegraphy, Antarctic discovery, or some new source of power ? We return to this aspect of the question in examining the detailed proposals submitted to us.Existing Arbitration and Conciliation Treaties.7. In view of the fact that the Arbitration Treaty with the United States is the first to expire, and in addition presents greater difficulties than any other, we have concentrated our attention first on the attitude we should adopt in regard to its renewal, leaving for later examination the renewal of the other Treaties.8. As a preliminary to the study of this question, it is necessary to have in mind the extent of our commitments to America in the matter of Arbitration and Conciliation.9. It is convenient to mention first (though it is the latest Treaty in point of time) the Kellogg Pact, a general Treaty, to which all the nations of the world have already expressed their intention to adhere, except Argentina and Brazil. The Kellogg Pact condemns recourse to war for the solution of international contro-versies, renounces it as an instrument of national policy in the relations of nations with one another, and provides that the solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise between them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.10. Second comes the Root-Bryce Arbitration Treaty, ratified on the 4th June, 1908, which has now expired and the renewal of which is under consideration.11. Third comes the Bryan (Conciliation) Treaty, ratified on the 10th December, 1914. The main provisions of this Treaty are that all disputes of every nature whatsoever, settlement of which is not provided for, and, in fact, achieved under existing agreements, shall, when diplomatic methods have failed, be referred for investigation and report to a Permanent International Commission, and the Contracting Parties agree not to declare war or begin hostilities during the investigation or before the report is submitted. The International Commission has to be composed of five members, one chosen from each country by the Government thereof, one by each Government from a third country, the fifth by agreement between the two Governments from some other country. Special provision is made for, representation of the Dominions in cases affecting them, and there is a stipula-tion that the Report of the Commission shall be completed within a year of beginning work, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement. The Contracting Parties reserve the right to act independently on the subject-matter of the dispute after the report of. the Commission has been submitted.12. In addition to the above provisions, there are, of course,. available the Permanent Court of International Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, established af The Hague by the Convention of the 18th October, 1907.Proposal to Avoid an Arbitration Treaty,13. One proposal, which was submitted by the First Lord of the Admiralty and supported by the high authority of Lord Balfour (who, unfortunately, was prevented by ihdispdsitidh from taking any active5 share iirthis part of our,enquiry), was that the Kellogg Pact (assuming that it will be ratified) renders unnecessary the. renewal of the Root-Bryce Arbitration-Treaty. ;-Ih support of, this thesis.it is pointed out that&apos;the Kellogg/lPaet rules out war and provides, for the settlement qf conflicts by ;jiadific&apos;meahs&apos;* that ample pacific means are available, whether for conciliation or arbitration, in the Bryan Treaty and The Hague Courts; that the(elastic plan of leaving)to)the occasion.!the precise^niachinerytq be adopted is the better one; that the attempt to bring these disputes beforehand within hard and fast provisions of
legal procedure,,is a mistake; and, above all, that by avoiding renewal all these delicate matters of. &quot; belligerent rights &quot; and.&quot; special, interests &quot;&apos;. to which we have alluded would be avoided; ; &apos; /. : 14. Attractive as this proposal is at first sight, we do not feel able to recommend it, for adoption.,; Under existing conditions resort to arbitration is still in form, ;as well as in substance, discretionary, and Mr. Kellogg has intimated in conversation that he regards the Pact as stating a principle and the separate Treaties as a means of implementing it. The fact that war has been renounced as an instrument of national policy makes it all the more important to find some peaceful means of settling an international dispute. The majority of the Sub-Committee think it would be difficult to resist the pressure at home and abroad which would result from a refusal to conclude a separate Treaty. We have therefore examined the American draft with the utmost care with a view to ascertaining how far it will meet our require-ments and what amendments are needed to render it acceptable.15. We are informed that, judging by the experience of other countries, the United States Government would be unwilling to accept anv considerable amendment of their own draft. We have, therefore, aimed at making these amendments as few as possible, and we consider that each amendment we propose must be one that would carry the support of public opinion here, and, if possible, in America,The United States Draft Treaty.16. The first American draft of a Treaty of Arbitration to replace the Root-Bryce Treaty was forwarded by Mr. Kellogg on the 29th December; 1927 (CP. 22 (28)), but was superseded by a later draft forwarded on the 20th March, 1928.* The main provisions of the latter draft are contained in Articles 1 and 2, which a,re as follows : &quot;Article 1.&apos;&apos; All differences relating to international matters in which the high contracting parties are concerned by virtue of a claim of right made by one against the other under treaty or otherwise, which it has not been possible to adjust by diplomacy, which have not been adjusted as a result of reference to the Permanent International Commission constituted pursuant to the treaty signed at Washington on the 15th September, 1914, and which are justiciable in their nature by reason of being susceptible of decision by the application of the principles of law or equity, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court . of Arbitration established at The Hague by the convention of the 18th October, - 1907, or to some other competent tribunal, as shall be decided in each case by special agreement, which special agreement shall provide.for the organisation of such tribunal, if necessary, define its powers, state the question or questions at issue, and settle the terms of reference.The special agreement in each case shall be made on the part of the United States of America by the President of the United. States of America, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and on the part of the British Empire in accordance with the constitutional laws of the British Empire.

Depends upon or involves observance of the obligations of the British-Empire in.accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot;Article 3 provides that the Treaty shall remain in force unless and until terminated by one year&apos;s written notice given by one contracting party to the other.17. Before coming to the larger question of policy involved in the acceptance of this draft, there is an important alteration in a matter of detail which we recom-mend should be made, namely, the omission of the words &quot;or equity&quot; in line 8 of Article 1. The Lord Chancellor considers that these words are too ambiguous for inclusion in an international Treaty.18. As already mentioned (paragraph 4), the main difficulty in our acceptance of this draft arises from the omission of any reference to &quot;vital interests.&quot; In this respect the draft Treaty does not bear equally upon both parties. Most, if not all, of the American &apos;&apos; vital interests &apos;&apos; are included in the Monroe doctrine, and are therefore reserved from the Treaty by Article 2 (c), but there is no corresponding reservation in the case of the British Empire. We have carefully considered various means by which this deficiency can be made good.Proposals by Sir Cecil Hurst.19. One proposal, for which we are indebted to Sir Cecil Hurst, is that we should proceed to reserve our &quot;vital interests&quot; by specific definition. Worked out by Sir Cecil in Treaty shape this proposal takes the form of an additional article inserted between Articles 1 and 2 of the American draft, and an amendment of Article 2 (c) of that draft, as follows : Proposed new Article 2.The High Contracting Parties agree that as by the Treaty signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928, they have renounced war as an instrument of national policy and cannot, therefore, become involved in war in future except in self-defence or in pursuance of obligations undertaken for the purpose of repelling aggression and ensuring international co-operation, disputes which may arise between them out of belligerent measures which either of them may have been obliged to take shall, whatever the nature of the dispute, only be submitted to the above-mentioned Permanent International Commission.Proposed amendment of Article 2 (c).The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject-matter of which.....(c) depends upon or involves the maintenance of the policy proclaimed in the past by either of the High Contracting Parties in relation to particular areas wherein such party possesses special interests which it is bound to uphold in the interests of the peace of the world.-it. 4tr -Jfe ^fe m* Jfc&quot;ft- &quot;TV W &quot;A&quot;- (7V- A20. We have already indicated, in paragraph 6, some of the general objections to any attempt to define our &quot;vital interests.&quot; In addition, we consider that the reservation of the question of belligerent rights, as drafted in the proposed new Article 2, though covered by an ingenious justification,, would not be acceptable to the United States of America, and would not provide an easily defensible ground for a failure to conclude a Treaty. Further, some of us think it probable that the specific exclusion of belligerent rights would make it more difficult for us to refuse or avert an International Conference on Belligerent Rights at Sea. We have therefore rejected that part of Sir Cecil Hursfa proposal which deals with the specific exception of belligerent rights.21. Subject to the insertion at the end of the proposed Amendment to Article 2 (c) of the words &quot; its security &quot; in place of the words &quot;the peace of the world,&quot; we consider that this amendment embodying what we know as the British Monroe Doctrine, should be included in the Arbitration Treaty, and is justified by the notes we addressed to the American Government in signing the Kellogg Pact. We are, however, aware that this doctrine, owing to its necessary vagueness in our case, requires very delicate handling.-..
Proposal to Except from Arbitration Subjects for which no Accepted Rule ofLaw Exists.22-: A second suggestion which has been made for our consideration is that we ;should in Article. 1 agree to apply arbitration only in the case of those differences which are justiciable in their nature by reason of being susceptible of decision by the application of a recognised rule of law: This is designed to enable us to withhold from compulsory arbitration the question of belligerent rights amongst other questions where there is no recognised rule of law. Apart from the question whether it is desirable at all to withdraw belligerent rights from arbitration, which will be discussed in a moment, this proposal has in its favour that it is consistent with the line we have taken in the past in refusing to accept the principle of compulsory arbitration. Historically it is justified by what occurred in the case of the Venezuelan boundary dispute .of 1897,* a case in which Great Britain might well have been deprived of a considerable portion of the colony of British Guiana if we had been bound to arbitrate under provisions similar to those of the Kellogg draft Arbitration Treaty. We note also that this proposal is consistent with one of the general considerations which the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa /suggests as a basis of our policy, viz. : , &quot;V. That a State cannot be accused of unreasonableness if it refuses to submit to arbitration a case not covered by existing rules of international law or when these rules are vague or highly controversial . . . .&quot;23. On the other hand, in weighing the merits of this proposal, we must -obviously, in the first place, bear in mind that the Americans might refuse it and the negotiations on the Arbitration Treaty come to an end. In the second place, it is right to mention that Sir Cecil Hurst criticises it on the ground that under it we could not reserve belligerent rights from arbitration without detriment to the very basis on which we justify their reservation. He points out that our contention has always been that our Prize Courts, which are entirely independent of the executive, do, in fact, administer what we believe to be a rule of international law, and that, on this, ground, we claim finality for their proceedings. He argues, therefore, that if we were to reserve such questions from arbitration on the ground that there is no rule of law, we should ipso facto destroy the basis of our claim to the finality of our Prize Courts and materially weaken our position.24.   There is, no doubt, force in this argument, but we are not disposed to . attach conclusive weight to it.  For our Prize. Courts administer what we claim to be international law.   If we decline an arbitration on the ground that some other countries do not recognise the same rule as ourselves it does not appear to us to forfeit our claim that the rules on which our Prize Courts work are correct.25. There is, however, a further and even more important observation to be made on this proposed amendment. As has&apos; been indicated, its principal object is, under cover of the exemption of differences not subject to&apos;a recognised rule of law, to withdraw belligerent rights from arbitration. The members of the Committee having carefully considered whether this object is in the true interests of our country, -are divided in their opinion. We will revert to this question directly.Proposal to Require Parliamentary Consent.26. A third proposal for safeguarding our &quot;vital interests&quot; in the new Arbitration Treaty is that we should amend Article 1 of the American draft so as to provide that the special agreement in regard to the organisation, powers and terms of reference of each case referred to arbitration shall be subject to the approval of the Parliament of Great Britain or of any Dominion whose interests are affected, upon the analogy of the corresponding provision on the American side providing for the advice and consent of the Senate., 27. As the American draft stands, the &quot;contrast in the treatment of the two countries in this respect is. startling, and, in fact, experience has taught us that the consent of the Senate can never certainly be presumed.   Without anticipating that* See Appendix i.
the requirement of the consent of Parliament will be equally effective, this plan would ensure that, before we were committed to any particular arbitration, both Houses of Parliament here, and, where they are to be parties, the Parliaments of any of the Dominions, would have to be consulted. The hands of our negotiators would be strengthened by the knowledge that the agreement would have to be acceptable not only to the House of Commons, where the agreement might or might not be carried by using the Parliamentary majority, but also to the House of Lords, which, as shown by the rejection of the Declaration of London, is liable to adopt a more independent attitude in these national questions.28. If it &quot;was made clear in the course of the negotiations leading up to the signature of the Treaty that this Parliamentary consent was really intended to be used as a reserve power in extreme cases where the circumstances, in the opinion of responsible British Authorities, obviously rendered a resort to arbitration inequitable, the safeguard would be of the greatest value.29. It is difficult to forecast what the attitude of the American Government would be towards the amendment now under consideration. They might ask why, in the case of this particular Treaty, we insisted on departing from the normal constitutional procedure of approval by Crown prerogative alone. Our reply would be that the Treaty in the form of Mr. Kellogg&apos;s draft presented a one-sided effect which was not acceptable here; that we were merely asserting in the Treaty a power which the Crown was always able to exercise, and which, in fact, is frequently exercised in the case of important Treaties in Great Britain, and, in the case of all Treaties in some of the Dominions; and that we intended to include a corresponding provision in other arbitration treaties to be concluded.30. Further, if we approach the Government of the United States with such a proposal, a great deal will depend upon how our case is put. In submitting it to them we should, of course, highly commend the American draft.as it affects the United States, we should dwell with approval upon the elastic intervention of the&quot; Senate, which we should assume would only be used in extreme cases and on very rare occasions, and in this spirit we should suggest that the only satisfactory arrangement would be to make the provisions of the Article exactly parallel on both sides.Belligerent Rights and the Treaty.31. The Arbitration Treaty which the majority of the Committee are prepared to recommend for the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet does not exclude Belligerent Rights from amongst the subjects to which, in the last resort, arbitration could be claimed by either party. A substantial minority of the Committee, however, do not accept this solution and make an alternative proposal that the Treaty should be signed subject only to a formal intimation that Belligerent Rights are reserved from arbitration until agreement has been reached as to what those rights are. The First Sea Lord, speaking on behalf of the Naval Staff, demurs to the submission of belligerent rights to compulsory arbitration under any condition. His reasons are stated in full in Appendix II. Sir Maurice Hankey asks that his agreement with Sir Charles Madden may be recorded.32. Before setting forth the alternative theses in detail it is necessary to state that on certain fundamental questions of principle the two sections of the Committee are agreed. All are agreed in regretting that we cannot renew the Arbitration Treaty in the old form, excluding vital interests. With the exception of Lord Cushendun, who is in favour of wide concessions by this Country on Belligerent Rights, all are agreed that it is important to maintain these in the highest form that is possible  a matter that will be dealt with in detail in our main Report. The difference then arises not on the principle of maintaining Belligerent Rights high, but on the best method of achieving that end. Those who support the method of concluding an Arbitration Treaty applicable to Belligerent Rights do so with reluctance and only to avoid what they regard as greater risks. Those who oppose this do so because they consider that the risks of injuring1 our belligerent rights in the long run are greater than those involved in the alternative course that they propose. At best it is a choice of evils that the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet have to make. We proceed to state in detail the different views which have been laid before us.
; Proposals, of the Majority.33. The majority.of the Sub-Committee includes the Chairman (Lord Salisbury), the; Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Lord Chancellor, the President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who though differing widely from his colleagues as to the desirable standard of belligerent rights supports the majority on this question. The arguments which have convinced the majority are as follows.34. In the first, place they are satisfied that if Belligerent Rights are withdrawn from arbitration an International Conference will be called together by the United States on the subject of these rights, the invitation to which we must surely accept, and that there will inevitably be a demand from nearly all the Powers participating in the Conference that these rights should be placed at a lower level than we could to-day obtain from a Court of Arbitration, and that American public opinion will support this demand; and for this reason, that public opinion is looking towards Freedom of the Seas, whilst the finding of a Court could not be at a. lower level than is prescribed by the American Naval Instructions, and would probably be upon an even higher standard. As will be observed from the Report we are about to submit on the general question of Belligerent Rights, the Committee have carefully examined these Instructions with the result that they turn out to differ.less from our own than we have had reason to expect. We have therefore not so much to fear from arbitration upon the uncertain law as it stands as from being faced with the amended law which American public opinion would demand at the Conference.35. We could, of course, resist the demand, but, if we were to take such a course whilst at the same time leaving the United States no ultimate appeal upon any belligerent rights issue except to force, we should not be supported by oar own people.36. It is no doubt true that we might, after signing an arbitration Treaty not excluding belligerent rights from arbitration, still be invited to a Conference on the subject of these rights, and certainly in that event, as in the former case, we could not afford to reject the invitation. But in this case we need only accept on the under-standing that the subject-matter should be limited to the codifying or bringing into harmony existing practice, and we could refuse to attend any Conference which had as its object an alteration or amendment of the law. For having shown ourselves so amenable as to allow Belligerent Rights to be arbitrable, we could confidently anticipate support from public opinion, at any rate in England, in refusing to attend a Conference which had as its object amendment outside the practice not only of England but of America herself. In other words, if belligerent rights are not to be controlled by arbitration, the case for their careful scrutiny and amendment upon the plea, of placing them upon an equitable basis is immensely strengthened. If, on the other hand, arbitration is admitted, all that can be required isi that the law and practice should be made clear as they stand, and we have a strong case to refuse to move from that position. In fact, our situation would be so strong that not only could we resist anything below the level of the American Instructions, but even in the solution at the Conference of the ambiguous points that lie between ourselves and the United States we ought to do very well. In the interests, indeed, of high belligerent rights, it may not unreasonably be contended that the only way to secure them in these negotiations and conferences is to avoid coalescing all neutral Powers against us by refusing to allow issues, which are so clearly justiciable as Belligerent Rights, to be subject to some form of arbitration. -  &apos;37. It must not be forgotten that Prize Courts, in deciding a question,of Belligerent Rights, purport to be administering International Law. To refuse to allow questions depending entirely upon. International Law to be settled by impartial decision will be represented as equivalent to an announcement to. the world that,we do not intend to be bound by International Law, but only by the standard, of our own necessities.. This- has: often been alleged against us in ,the past,, to give substance to the-charge by a refusal of arbitration will go very far to provide the.incentive needed&apos;tO&apos;make the citizens of the United States resolve to do their utmost to prevent us from&apos;ever again exercising the rights we. claim, The,truth; must- be faced that we shall be less able in the future than we were in the late war to enforce [18863] c
Belligerent Rights against United States commerce beyond the limits permitted by the United States. If an Arbitration Treaty exists we can at least rely on the exercise of those rights which are recognised by their Own Prize Court decisions and Naval Instructions : if there is no Arbitration Treaty, the United States may dispute even this measure of liberty for our Navy, and might conceivably even claim for their commerce that freedom of the seas which a large section of their public opinion already demand. In the absence of an Arbitration Treaty, we should have no redress against such a claim.. In this view, the existence of an Arbitration Treaty, including Belligerent Rights, is a protection to- rights which we have no other means of enforcing against the will of the United States.38. But beyond these points broadly the majority are convinced that, if Belligerent Rights are excluded, the Arbitration Treaty will not be, accepted by the American. Government at all and with the. Treaty, the. whole structure of a new departure in cordial relations with that Country in the near future would fall to the ground. On the other hand the signature of the Treaty would produce great advantages not only in the sphere of general policy, but even in respect of Belligerent Rights themselves. As regards general policy the conclusion of the Treaty would tend to ease the situation in the cruiser controversy by removing the argument,, which has been used with so much effect during the debates in Congress, that a great American Navy is required in order to prevent Great Britain, when engaged in war, from interfering with neutral trade. The existence of the Treaty would clearly cut away this contention. The Secretary of State fpr Foreign Affairs indeed Believes that this would so far improve the situation that the President might even refrain altogether from summoning \ a Conference notwithstanding the general attitude of the Senate. However, that may be, even if a Conference were summond, we would repeat what has already been indicated in paragraph 36, namely, that we should be in a strong position to insist that the subject-matter should be limited to codification and that even that codification should fairly take account of the British side of the case.39. There is this further point. If we were engaged in war and there were to be an outcry against our exercise of Belligerent Rights, an American Government, being anxious not to break with us, would be in a better position to stand up to popular pressure in favour of drastic action if it could remind the public that arbitration lay behind its diplomatic endeavour. There would be no risk of precipitate executive action. Indeed, far from this, there can be nothing remotely resembling precipitation in the operation of the American Arbitration Treaty. First diplomacy must be tried. After its failure the nature of the dispute may be such that resort can be had to the Bryan Conciliation Commission, which is allowed a year for its efforts. Then the &quot;agreement&quot; as to what is to be arbitrated has to be settled between the two Governments and approved by the Senate, and, if the Committee&apos;s proposals are adopted, by the Parliaments of all parts of the Empire eoncerned. Then only is it referred to arbitration whether by the Permanent Court of Arbitration established at the Hague or some other competent tribunal, and, when that point has been reached, there is no reason why the result should be adverse to our claim.40. At this point it must be said that, whatever the Cabinet decide upon the question which has divided the Committee, we cannot escape having regard to the Court of International Arbitration. If we are parties to an arbitration there is always a British Judge upon the tribunal, and his influence, indeed his mere presence, is no inconsiderable guarantee of an equitable decision. But it should be remembered that if we are not parties, even if we have no arbitration treaty at all and are not technically amenable to the decisions of the Court, these decisions cannot fail to weigh with us. The point of view of the world opinion which would accept them and the attitude of neutrals generally must react upon any inclination of ours to exercise Belligerent Rights in defiance of those decisions even though we may not have recognised their validity.41. Finally, the amendment to which we have referred, under which the last word as to the reference of a particular issue to arbitration would lie with the Parliaments of Great Britain or her Dominions, as the case may be, is of the essence of the proposed Treaty which the majority submit to the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet. If it were true that, once the Arbitration Treaty is signed without the exclusion of Belligerent Rights, every issue in respect of those rights, whatever the circumstances of it, however vital it may be, however great our want
Proposals of the Minority:     r &quot;   - &quot;42. The minority of the Committee is composed of - the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for India. They, too, are in favour of omitting from the Arbitration Treaty itself -any qualification which, overtly or covertly, would exclude belligerent rights from its purview: But they would accompany the Treaty by a separate reservation declaring that we cannot regard the Treaty as applying to cases arising out of the exercise of belligerent-rights at sea pending agreement as to what those rights are, but intimating our readiness to enter upon the discussion of this whole question at an early date. Lord Balfour, who, to the great regret of all his colleagues, has, for reasons of health, as already mentioned, not been able to take any active part in the discussions on arbitration-has also expressed doubts in regard to the proposals of the majority. After perusing the Minutes of the Meeting at which the majority scheme was discussed, Lord Balfour expressed views which have been summarised by Sir Harry Batterbee, of the Dominions Office, in the following terms : &quot; Although he had always been opposed to. a conference if it could be&apos; avoided, it might be preferable to obtain a definite codification of belligerent rights at a conference, provided that it did not fall appreciably below the United States Naval Instructions of 1917, rather than to, rely upon arbitration. If &apos; arbitration were accepted, it might result in our losing the rights we needed by the reference of disputes to The Hague in wars in which we took no part. He fully realised the extreme difficulty of the situation, but he hoped that before any decision were reached to allow belligerent rights to. go to arbitration, every other avenue would be very fully explored.&quot; ,43. The views, of Mr. Bridgeman, Mr. Amery and Lord Peel are based on similar doubts. They believe that to include Belligerent Rights among the questions liable to compulsory arbitration is the beginning of concessions, which will afterwards make it difficult for any Government, to stand, firm. In time these rights will be whittled away, not only in arbitrations to which we are a party, but in arbitrations arising out of wars in which we are not engaged, the decisions of which will become established precedents. The Permanent Court of International Justice, the Court that would normally be appealed to by all Powers other than the United States of America, consists of Judges elected from Spain, Italy, Brazil, Cuba, Great Britain, Switzerland, Holland, United States of America, Denmark, Japan, France. What prospect is there, the minority of the Committee ask, that a Court so constituted would endorse a high level of maritime rights?  As Mr. Malkin wrote in 1924 :- &quot;It is very difficult for a Court composed of international lawyers, when dealing with cases of this nature, to realise that what they have go to do is not to apply the rules which they will find in text-books, based as they are entirely on the experience of the past, but to endeavour to discover what should be regarded as the applicable rules of international law in the circumstances of the present. If, for instance, a really serious attempt had been made to test before an arbitral tribunal the validity of the decisions of the American Prize Courts in the Civil War in relation to contraband and blockade, I think there can be little doubt that these decisions would at that time have been condemned; but even before the last war there was almost general agreement that the development of the old rules embodied in those decisions was sound.&quot;44. The Minority hold that to entrust the future employment of Belligerent Rights to the decisions of some such tribunal as that described above would be to run ttoo great a risk. They point out that any nation, however small, will be able to bring us to arbitration.   The American Arbitration Treaty will not stand alone.   It will-of confidence in the tribunal that will adjudicate, must upon the demand of the American Government be compulsorily referred to-arbitration, the Cabinet might well shrink from such a conclusion. But in these democratic days such an abdication cannot be defended. The American Government do not&apos; attempt to defend it. We have only to follow their example, and if the circumstances are strong enough and the issue important enough&apos;we may, under the shield of this amendment, confidently rely upon our Parliaments to protect us.       &apos;  1&apos; V-
provide a model which will have, to be followed in similar Treaties with other countries. There is no. doubt that the existence of Compulsory Arbitration Treaties with Holland and Denmark, for example, would have proved an immeasurable handicap, during the War to the. exercise of Belligerent &quot;Rights, &quot;which, though contrary to precedent, were justified by the circumstances of the situation. The decisions of arbitrations under the new Treaties will handicap us in future wars, since they will be binding for all time and in all wars.45. If the Minority feel the gravest anxiety in regard to the risks involved in &quot;the Majority proposals, they are profoundly sceptical as to the realisation of the advantages claimed for them. They do not believe that the great sacrifice we ar? making in submitting Belligerent Rights to arbitration is going to produce any permanent difference to our relations with the United States of America. Since the war the British Empire has made considerable concessions to American opinion  the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the funding and regular service of the debt, the extension of the operations of liquor prohibition vessels beyond the three-mile limit. During the same period France has adopted a very different attitude. She has always held firmly to her principles on matters of national defence in refusing to discuss land armaments at Washington, in declining to agree to the abolition of submarines, or to ratify the Washington Convention applying to submarines the rules for the capture of merchant ships at sea. In addition, she has nof yet funded her debt. Yet, which nation is the more suspected, which the more respected, in America ? Which is the more frequent object of attack in Congress ? There is no ground, in the opinion of the Minority, to believe that one more great concession is going to change American&apos;&quot; opinion or to lead to any permanent reduction in the American naval programme.46. The Minority do not take the view that the Americans will refrain from summoning a Conference on the subject of Belligerent Rights because we agree to-include that subject within the scope of the Arbitration Treaty. The Americans, will be just as aware as we are ourselves that the concession is made to force majeure, and: it will not render them less anxious to compel further concessions. Moreover, the fact that we have accepted arbitration will make them the more anxious to clear-up the whole question of what is to be the law and practice of the future. For similar reasons the Minority scout the idea that we shall in fact be able to limit the discussions to a so-called &quot; codification.&quot; There is so much uncertainty that, at the best, there is bound to be a certain amount of rewriting. Much as the Minority, like the Majority, regret a Conference, they believe it is necessary to face the fact that we are very likely to receive an invitation, and that we cannot refuse it. Their plan, therefore, is frankly based on a recognition of the fact that a Conference is unavoidable. If the Conference results in a code of international law acceptable both to the Americans and ourselves, then they would consent to the inclusion of Maritime Belligerent Rights within the scope of the Arbitration Treaty. If the results of the Conference are not acceptable to us, or are rejected by the American Senate, then we remain free. They do not see that the Americans have any reasonable ground for objecting to our desire to have the inclusion of belligerent rights postponed for a year or two until this question is cleared up. By offering to conclude an &quot; all-in &quot; Arbitration Treaty, subject to the amendments proposed in this Report and subject to this one temporary exception, we shall have put ourselves right with our own public opinion. The delay will also give us time for a proper consultation with our Dominions and India, which, in any event, we ought to have before we enter a Conference on Belligerent Rights.47. It is also contended, on behalf of the Minority, that their method of procedure would retain for us a larger measure of initiative in dealing with the whole question. The reservation accompanying the Treaty of Arbitration would afford some opportunity for a dignified and reasoned statement of the case for our historic policy. If the Senate refused to accept the Treaty because of the temporary &apos; reservation, the onus of having caused a breakdown would clearly rest with them. The declaration&quot; of a willingness to enter a conference, which would necessarily have to accompany the reservation, would enable us both to declare that we could only do so after we had discussed the matter among ourselves at the next Imperial Conference, and to intimate that we regarded it as a Conference for the purpose of codifying and clearing up and not of modifying or revolutionising the existing; maritime law.
48. The Minority attach importance to the delay, which their proposals involve, in reaching a final decision from another point of view. They believe that the last few months of - a Governments term of office is an extraordinarily bad time for announcing a great concession to a foreign State. The acute differences between members of the Committee are bound to be reflected outside, and at the present time they will be discussed in an atmosphere that is wholly unfavourable to the formation of a steady and balanced public opinion.Statement of the Issue.49. In conclusion, the alternative proposals between which the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet are asked to. decide may be summed up as follows : Alternative &quot; A.&quot;The proposal of the majority of the Sub-Committee (Lord Salisbury, Sir Austen Chamberlain, Lord Hailsham, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister and Lord Cushendun) that the American draft, as amended in the form given below, should be accepted, and that Maritime Belligerent Rights should not be excluded from the Arbitration Treaty.Alternative &quot; B.&quot;The proposal of the minority of the Sub-Commif/Eee (Mr. Bridgeman, Mr. Am&apos;eryr Lord Peel, who base themselves on a point of view similar to Lord Balfour&apos;s) that the American draft, as amended below, should be accepted, but subject to an intimation that Maritime Belligerent Rights must be reserved from its operation until such time as agreement has been reached as to what those rights are.

Extract from, an Historical Review by the Historical Adviser to theForeign Office (B.R. 46).* -Jt- %r 4fc * ^20. Among the frontier arbitrations, one of the most celebrated and most instructive is the well-known conflict between Great Britain and Venezuela over the frontiers of British Guiana, and it is worth while putting the facts on record. The claim advanced by the Venezuelan Government, based, as it was, on.early documents fixing the frontiers between the Dutch and the Spanish Colonies, was of such a nature that it was quite conceivable that an arbitral award based purely on these documents would have deprived Great Britain of a considerable portion of the Colony over which she had, in fact, exercised sovereignty for many years, and which was in the occupation of British settlers. This, then, was in effect not merely a frontier, but a territorial problem of a large scope. Just for this reason the British Government, notwithstanding the insistence of the United States, always refused to allow the case to go to arbitration in such a form that the award might conceivably have deprived them of this territory. They proposed to get over the difficulty &quot;by making out the instructions to the arbitrator that fifty years&apos; actual occupation should be considered as giving full title. At first, Mr. Olney, the Secretary of State at Washington, strongly opposed this suggestion; eventually, however, after much correspondence, he withdrew his objection, and, in consequence, in the treaty of February 1897, by which the reference to the arbitrators was formulated, a clause was included providing that; Adverse holding or prescription during a period of fifty years shall make a good title. The arbitrators may deem exclusive political control of a district, as well as actual settlement thereof, sufficient to constitute adverse holding or to make title by prescription.In this way, Lord Salisbury was successful in that which he had throughout consistently maintained, that he could not consent to the risk of alienating, in consequence of an arbitral award, districts which had long been regarded as British possessions.  The reasons he gives for his action are instructive : The claim of Venezuela is so far-reaching that it brings into question interests and rights which cannot possibly be disposed of by an unrestricted arbitration. ... It covers two-thirds of the Colony of British Guiana; it impeaches titles which have not been in question for many generations. ... The view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is that where the matter in issue is of great importance and involvea rights which belong to a considerable population and are deeply cherished by them, special precautions against any miscarriage of justice are required.21. For our purpose the essential thing is to note that it was not by arbitra-tion but by diplomacy that the difference between the British and the American Governments (which was much more serious than that with Venezuela itself) was settled, for the difference had been not as to whether or not there should be arbitra-tion, but as to the limits and the scope of the arbitration. Of course, it would be possible to criticise Lord Salisbury&apos;s attitude and to maintain that if, as is the case, international law recognises no time limitations to claims and no right of prescription-tion to occupy territory, this is a grave omission which should be rectified. But surely at the present time it would be impossible to agree on and impose a general rule with regard to this question, and every legal decision by a court must nave in it some element of a general rule.   We may eventually come to a state of things
i7V.where such a general rule may be agreed on; at present all that can be hoped is that in an individual case a definite period can be arrived at, but this period must be one which quite clearly in no way constitutes a binding precedent, and for this reason it is better that it should be reached by agreement between the parties concerned and not be included in the questions referred to the arbitrator. (12)22. In regard to boundary questions as well as to private claims, we seem, then, to get to. a positive conclusion. Arbitration has established itself as having a very definite and positive value, but its application is strictly limited. It has not been applied in the past to the great territorial problems by which States have been divided and which in some cases have led to war; these are settled either by war or by diplomacy; in both cases the decision is incorporated in a treaty. Arbitration is used only in minor matters when difficulties arise in the application or interpreta-tion of the treaty in fixing the boundaries.w rw TC&quot; &quot;fr . &quot;TT(12) The point may be not without importance with regard to such matters as the Argentine the Falkland Islands and the Persian claim to Bahrein.
.   Remarks by the First Sea Lord on the Proposal to allow Belligerent Rights to go to Arbitration if International Maritime Law becomes Codified.THE Minority Report in paragraph 46 contains suggestions of a willingness to arbitrate on Belligerent Rights if an International Maritime Conference produces a code of law.I strongly recommend that such ideas be deleted.2.   No code can really be produced which can foresee the contingencies of war twenty, thirty or fifty years hence.The Declaration of London in 1909 and the war in 1914 made manifest the impossibility of such foresight even for so short a period as five years ahead. Had our Belligerent Rights been admitted as subject to arbitration in 1909 following on the Declaration of London, we should have been taken to arbitration by neutrals in 1914, and been deprived of our principal weapons for exercising economic pressure, thereby materially prolonging the war.3. A code of law lays down technical legal rules to give effect to the principles, which are the essence of these rights. Just as development in municipal law must come with time, so also must this be so with other law. Unfortunately, development of belligerent rights only materialises with war, when it is too late to revise rules for the guidance of arbitrators, who must presumably, therefore, abide by what is then probably obsolete, and insufficient to safeguard the vital principles at stake, and any modern applications of these principles.4. If we must attend a Conference to discuss with many other Powers codification of maritime rights, is it not better to go there unfettered by the know-ledge that the compromise arrived at, which is the most that can be expected, will perhaps subsequently be the subject of arbitration? If this is not so, will not contentious details be fought out to the detriment of good relations ?5. Further, if the principle that belligerent rights can be arbitrated on is conceded by the great maritime Powers, may not pressure be brought to eliminate belligerent rights from reservation under the optional clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court ?6. I view with the gravest misgivings from the point of view of the Naval Officer the idea of arbitration, particularly as I feel convinced that a body constituted like the Permanent Court of International Justice would give an adverse decision on the following issues that arose in the Great War, and may be important in another war Retaliation.Continuous voyage in relation to conditional contraband. Diversion.Inclusion of many articles in the list of absolute contraband. Examination of mails. Convey. Mining. .  Angary.7. Such decision may be given by such a body largely constituted of biassed neutrals in the early stages of a long&apos; war, and even pending the arbitral decision, the Court or the Neutral will ask us to stop the practice complained of, and the Navy Will almost certainly be instructed accordingly.8.   As I see it, our sea power will be stultified.Admiralty, S.W. 1, February 9, 1929.
ioNote by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I WAS asked by the Committee to make reference, by way of addendum to this Report, to certain points arising out of the correspondence with the Dominions which lie somewhat outside the general principles with which this Report is mainly concerned.1. Our proposals have, of course, been based on the assvunption that the application of any new Treaty will be Empire-wide, i.e., that all the Dominions and India will be co-signatories with the United Kingdom. While, however, the other Dominions have indicated their willingness to participate in the Treaty, some doubt has arisen as to the intentions of the Irish Free State. No reply has been received from the Free State Government to requests for an expression of their views on the United States draft, but in a recent despatch they have declined to associate them-selves with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in the proposed temporary renewal of arbitration treaties with France, Italy and Spain, and have announced their intention of negotiating separate arbitration treaties with those countries. It is to be hoped that on further consideration they will recede from this attitude, or at least refrain from adopting a similar policy in the case of the United States of America, but if they should insist in the latter case also on the negotiation of a separate treaty, the draft Treaty proposed in this Report will require re-examination.2. The Prime Minister of Canada, while intimating that Canada is prepared, should occasion arise, to make use of the means of conciliation provided by the Bryan Treaty of 1914 has suggested as an alternative that consideration should be given to the desirability of adapting to the purposes of the Bryan Treaty the organisation and methods of the International Joint Commission created by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between Canada and the United States. This suggestion is outside the scope of the present Report and would, I think, best merit investigation in connection with any general proposals for the revision of the Bryan Treaty.3. General Hertzog has proposed inter alia the addition of a separate subsection to Article 2 of the draft Treaty to the effect that the question whether any dispute falls within any of the categories set forth in the article as it now stands shall, at the request of either of the High Contracting Parties, be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided for in the Treaty. I am of opinion, and I think the Committee were also of this view, that the acceptance of this proposal would give rise to very great difficulties; in particular, it would render liable to arbitration the question whether the subject-matter of any particular dispute is or is not a matter of domestic jurisdiction.4. Mr. Bruce, in his comments on the United States draft, raised the question whether it would not be well to insert a reservation excluding matters which &apos;&apos; depend upon or involve any questions affecting the relations of the various parts of the British Empire inter se or of any parts of the British Empire, with regions in which the British Empire, according to its traditional attitude, has special interests.&quot; The latter part of this suggested reservation is now covered by Article 2 (c) of the draft Treaty attached to this report. The first part has been carefully examined, both in the Dominions Office and the Foreign Office, and though there might be certain advantages in reserving from arbitration all questions affecting the relations of the various parts of the British Empire&quot; inter se, I have reached the conclusion, in which I understand the Lord Chancellor concurs, that (subject to developments in connection with the point referred to at (1) in this note) the arguments in favour of such a reservation are outweighed by those against it.5. It may be noted that the phraseology of the Bryan Treaty of1914 is not in conformity with modern constitutional requirements. This has already been pointed out by Canada. Various other points, to a considerable extent of a drafting nature, have also been raised in connection with the draft Arbitration Treaty, but I do not elaborate them here since I feel that they could best be examined by an Interdepartmental Committee consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, Dominions Office and India Office. ..
