(This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government). EGRET0 A B I H E T.CP. 45  (29)IRISH    IMMIGRATION. 1oMeaorandum by the Homo Secretary.Pursuant to the Cabinet decision in August last (Cabinet 42 (28) Conclusion 10),  I have been making inquiries both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish Office, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Health,  and Board of Trade, in an endeavour to ascertain more precisely the extent of the immigration of Irishmen both from Northern Ireland and the Free State into England and Scotland.    The results of these inquiries are summarised in Appendices A. B. C. and D.    Taken in conjunction with a report, to which I will refer later, on inquiries specially conducted by a senior member of my Immigration Staff, the figures given strongly suggest that the mischief of which the representatives of the Scottish Churches who came to see me in July last  complained, has already been done and that the immigration of natives of the Irish Free State to Scotland is not now such as to affect materially the position created by the presence in Scotland of a large body of persons of Irish extraction.Certain of the Tables need some explanation,  in particular that contained in Appendix A which was compiled from reports furnished in confidence by the three Shipping Companies engaged in Irish Channel traffic.    It is,  in the first place, reasonable to  infer from the smallness of the figures relating to the third-class traffic between Irish Free State ports and Scotland that much of the Free State traffic passes through Northern Ireland ports:    but the general conclusion to which the Table as it stands points would be only slightly disturbed even if all the passengers carried between Scotland and Northern
Ireland were natives of the Free State.    The nett loss of Free State Irishmen would show an increase from 414 to 799, the loss of women would he translated with a gain of 505 and the children would show an increased gain of 517.    A totally different com-plexion would,  of course, be put on the figures if the Irishmen who entered Scotland during the period in question via northern Ireland ports were all natives of the Free State,  and if no members of the Free State were numbered in the outgoing figures. It is, however, extremely improbable that such is the case.In the second place, the Table shows for England a nett loss of 1708 males from the Free State and a gain of 4316 females and 1366 children under 16.    These figures do not, however, take any account of loss by migration.    The Board of Trade returns show that during the three months under review 480 males, 439 females and 102 children under 12 whose permanent place of residence was the Free State embarked at British ports for countries outside Europe.    It is not possible to make for this factor an accurate correction in the Table of the Shipping Companies&apos; returns, as children between 12 and 16 have been included in the Board of Trade figures with the &quot;males&quot; and &quot;females&quot;.The surplus of females remaining in this country may no doubt in part be explained by the entry of women seeking employ-ment as domestic servants - an influx which certainly takes plaoe but which cannot be even approximately measured as domestic service is not an insurable employment.In the third place, It is probable that the three months of September, October and November which had perforce to be selected, are not typical,  and that the traffic over a period of years will show a gain of South Irishmen in Scotland and not a loss. Table IV (b)  in Appendix B lends colour to this view, but it confirms the impression that such gain as there may be is likely to be inconsiderable.Appendix B contains information furnished by the Scottish Office in regard to destitution,  crime,  lunacy, migration and
A f3 9 i1 O Oo ***Roman Catholic marriages.    It seems to be quite evident that at any rate during the years 1921-192? the percentage of Irish pauperism to total pauperism has not on the whole been adversely affected by the immigration of Irish and that during the years 1925-1927 there has been a progressive decline in the proportion which Irish born prisoners bear to the total.    The percentage Is admittedly high, but certainly no higher than it was in 1921. The Table of marriage tells the same story:    the percentage of Roman Catholic marriages to total marriages has varied in the years 1921 to 1926 between ICS and 11.5.Appendix C summarises information collected by the Ministry of Labour through the Employment Exchanges in Glasgow, Greenock and Lanarkshire, and in Liverpool, Manchester and Salford over a period of two months - October and November.   These figures do not, of course, purport to cover all those who came for employment from the Free State to the districts in question during October and November.    They take no account of persons who did not apply personally at the Labour Exchanges and they exclude therefore, inter alios, all those who came to employment open to them.    TheBe figures must also be accepted with certain other reservations:    the persons covered by the Table are identified as Irish if their last place of employment was In ireland    English shipyard workers, for instance, returning from work in the Belfast shipyards to their homes would be counted as Irish.   Again, the return does not include those who attended at the Exchanges before the beginning of October though they may have obtained employment in the period under review, nor those who came from Ireland and obtained employment however short before applying at the local office.    But after making allowances one way or the other for these reservations the broad conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that they furnish no evidence of any considerable immigration of labour from the Irish Free State to Great Britain.    So far as Scotland only is concerned, the Table shows that in the two months under review 84 natives of the Free State applied at the Exchanges in Glasgow, Greenock and
Lanarkshire for employment.    If it be assumed that this is a normal figure for any two months of the year,- and there is, of course, no evidence either for this or a contrary assumption -it would, appear to represent something like 500 applications during the year.    Allowing for those Immigrants who did not trouble the Labour Exchanges and for wives and children, the Table would suggest on the above basis an inflow into Scotland last year of something in the nature of 2,000 souls.    This very tentative estimate also is not inconsistent with Table IV (b) in App appendix B.The conclusion that there is no considerable influx of labour from the Irish Free State receives some support from other sources.    The deputation from the Scottish Churches thought that employers in Scotland were being brought to realise the undesirability of importing Irish labour and the Industrial Transference Board (page 29 of their Report) reported that: &quot;We already have experience that one or two employers who have been accustomed to engage Irish immigrant labour on a considerable scale for seasonal work have recognised the convenience of having similar labour available much closer at hand and have engaged unemployed miners for the work through the Emp1oyment Exchange s.&quot;The figures are,  of course, negligible in comparison with the total insured population of Scotland or with the normal inflow into industry from all sources,    The total insured population is about       millions,  and the new entrants bo insurance in a year number about 80,000.A further check was suggested by the transfer provisions of the National Health Insurance Actsp and the Ministry of Health have furnished me with the Table in Appendix D*    It should be explained that ordinarily an insured person is transferred from a Free State to a British Society      including, that is, Scottish and Welsh Societies * when his cards for two half years bear British stamps without any intervening Irish stamps.    He may also be transferred sooner at his own request.    The transfer
indicates a fairly definite change of residence and the return would not, therefore, cover any who come to England or Scotland for a few months only for seasonal employment.    The Ministry of Health have also ascertained for me the amount paid during 1923 and 1924 in National Health Insurance contributions in respect of the employment in Great Britain of insured persons who ordinarily reside in the Free State.    The total of such contributions paid in 1923 was  2,191, and in 1924,  3,478, representing approximately 58,400 and 92,720 weeks of employment respectively.    It oannot he stated how many individuals are represented by these figures because the length of employment in this country is not, of course, known. But if it be assumed that the persons concerned were,  on the average, employed here for six months, the number of individuals concerned would be 2,246 and 3,566 respectively. Neither these figures nor the figures relating to transfer are impressive.I mentioned earlier an inquiry of a somewhat general nature conducted by one of the Immigration Officers, Mr. Cooper, into the question of Irish immigration into Lancashire and the West of Scotland.    The Chief Constables or their deputies of the Borough Forces in lancashire and of the County Force, were interviewed and in Scotland of Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Hamilton, Dumbarton (County and Borough), Renfrewshire, Paisley, greenock, Ayrshire and Ayr.    The general impression conveyed as a result of the tour was that the damage has already been done and that the natural increase of the Irish population already in Scotland, which is high in pro-portion to their numbers, will not greatly be affected by the very limited annual immigration that is now taking place.If my colleagues agree with me in the view I have formed after considering the information now available, it is obvious that there is no need,  for the present at any rate, to pursue the proposals set out in CP. 262  (28) which were formulated on the assumption that there was a considerable annual Increase
by migration of Irishmen into Scotland and that the gravity of the situation would justify a departure from present law and practice regarding the rights of British subjects to enter this country.    The situation is clearly not such as to warrant inter-ference with these rights and I have not, therefore, thought it necessary to consult the Government of Northern Ireland as to the effect these proposals would have upon Northern Ireland.Though the annual inflow of Irishmen from the Free State into Scotland does not constitute a serious threat to the continuity of Scottish life and traditions, the numbers of the Irish already in Scotland and their tendency to multiply at a rate disproportionate to the increase of the native population is a matter for serious concern, and this tendency is the more alarming when taken into conjunction with the figures relating to emigration from Scotland given in Appendix B, Table IV (a). It may be true that the number of persons of Irish extraction throughout the whole of Scotland is small as compared with the total population but if (as appears to be the case,    from Appendix B Table V) they segregate themselves in a few localities, they can, locally, exercise a considerable and admittedly undesirable influence.    It is, in fact, the Irish and their descendants already in Scotland who present the real problem and, failing whosesale repatriation, which I take to be out of the question, the only measure of alleviation which commends itself as being both just and practicable is the repatriation of those who within a fixed period of their arrival in Scotland become a charge on the rates.    It will be observed from Table I (b) in Appendix B that the number of Irish born who became chargeable to the parishes concerned within six month of arrival, exceeds the number of those who after longer residence applied for relief.    The Secretary of State for the Dominions has for some time past been in communication with the Irish Free State Government with a view to making reciprocal arrangements for the repatriation of deotitute persons but Mr. Oosgrave has, not unnaturally,  shown as yet little
inclination to assistn I would suggest that further endeavours should be made to press forward with these arrangements.I think also that the help of the Scottish employers should be enlisted.    Unless there were a demand for Irish labour there would be little encouragement either for Irishmen to enter Scotland or for those who have recently arrived to remain^    Moreover,  if Scottish employers showed a decided preference for Scottish labour, the Irish elements now in employment would eventually be forced on to poor relief and might,  subject to whatever arrangements are made, become eligible for repatriation.    The suggestion that the Secretary of State for Scotland should address a circular, based, of course,  on the gravity of the unemployment situation to the employers organisations in Scotland is, perhaps, worth considering.W.
