AIR ESTIMATES AND THE COURSE OF AIR EXPENDITURE IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD.Preliminary. I CIRCULATE this memorandum on air expenditure in GreatBritain, the. United States, France, and Italy, together with a few remarks on certain other aspects of the difficult problem of air expenditure, in compliance with the request made by the Cabinet at their last meeting before Christmas (Cabinet 58 (28), Item 2).^educeT^nTucce6&quot; 2&apos; My coll?agues wul remember that on that occasion I quoted figures sire yeareasCmceUi925 which established that, whilst British Air Estimate, had been notably e*TarL6ion^Hom^n reduCf?d in recent years, the Air Estimates of the other Great Powers show accordanoea witT^he large increases. Several members of the Cabinet were evidently impressed mITj)Teases In ^ ^e %ures&apos; anc* tne Foreign Secretary asked me to amplify them in athe   Sudan   and   atmemorandum.   The result is this paper.   In it I have attempted to give a thtatreinth^hR0haiaAir general sketch of the air expenditure of the Great Powers.   I have alsoForce has taken overattempted to point out the peculiar difficulties with which we are faced IT new umte0rfma,ion &quot;J en(ieavouring to avoid a sharp rise in our own Air Estimates.   On the oPerationUwith0Navy one hand, there is the national demand for reduced expenditure.   On the (Tui me^Wit? new 0^er hand, there is the no less insistent need for stronger air defence and t^pe?o&apos;fenmaTh1ne.new fQr a fuller development of air power to meet Imperial requirements.   I Thtifanreionow no &apos;ess ^0 no^ now as^ ^or an7 Cabinet decision upon the best way to reconcile bewtheiG^flgure!&quot; these divergent demands.   I do not even ask that my colleagues should express an opinion upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ plea for a reduction in air expenditure.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have always in the past arrived at a1 friendly agreement upon Estimates, and I have no reason to suppose that our experience will differ this year from that of former years.   I do, however, press my colleagues to give careful attention to&quot; the state of affairs which I proceed to describe and to keep constantly in mfed the startling progress and expanding expenditure that are such conspicuous and disquieting features in the programmes of the other Great Powers.I then explained further that the Royal Air Force is little more than half way through the Home Def ence* expansion scheme recommended in 1923, after a prolonged investigation, by the Sub-Committee on National and Imperial Defence, and subsequently approved by three successive Governments. That scheme, which was of a modest character and was not intended to give us anything like full air &quot; parity,&quot; was originally estimated to entail an additional expenditure of  5^ million annually, as Parliament was informed at the time, and gross Air Estimates were then already within  ^ million of their present figure. The Birkenhead Committee, of course, recommended that the completion of this scheme should be postponed until 1935 instead of 1930, t and this enabled me to effect reductions in its annual cost by spreading the necessary capital expenditure over a longer period. Even, however, on, a basis of the provisional figures laid before that Committee, Air Estimates should next year be no less than  2 million above their current figure, which is some indication of the very large economies we have achieved. The Air Ministry is, therefore, I think, entitled to claim that it has performed a remarkable feat in continuing this expansion scheme at all it involves multiplying our first-line strength threefold and is probably the largest proportionate expansion^ which, a fighting service has ever attempted to achieve in so short a period under - peace conditions whilst simultaneously showing a reduction in gross Air* The Home Defence squadrons also constitute an Imperial Air Reserve. A number of them are accordingly kept on a more mobile basis than the remainder in order that they may be available for de- patch overseas on emergency. i.e., they have dual functions and also fulfil a r6le comparable to 1 hat of the ArmyV Expeditionary Force For example, the emplo;\ ment overseas of a largv proportion of the squadrons primarily provided for Home Defence would be essential if the.Russian menace to Afghanistan matured.-f The or it-finally date for rompletion was 1928. This was put back to 1930 prior to the appointment of the Birkenhead Committee.
Increased expenditure in 1929/30 is inevitable. Even a complete re-veraal of approved policy would production a negligible effect on next year&apos;s Estimates and such, a step would be thoroughly unecon-omical. It would, moreover, be bound to lead to a seare in a few years&apos; time and a demand for rapid expansion.Comparison of air ex-penditure (including civil aviation) in Great Britain, the u.s.A., France and Italy since 1925. The steady de-crease in British air expenditure has been accompanied by re-markable increases abroad in all three cases. A smaller pro-portion (a) of our total defence expendi-ture and (j) of our . national expenditure as a whole is spent on &quot; air &quot; in this country than in the u.s.A., France or Italy.[18729]b 2estimates* each successive year since 1^25,/until the figure for lq28t is no less than 10 per cent, below that for tide former year, despite the peculiar difficulties of the royal air force, e.g., the lack of permanent buildings, trie short life of its equipment, and the consequent need for the continuous provision of new types of aircraft and engine. for it must not be forgotten (a) that we are still in process of building up a new service from its first beginnings;(&amp;) that since 1925, over and, above the steady expansion which has proceeded at home, the royal air force (i) has taken over yet a further sphere of responsibility in themiddle east (in addition to iraq, palestine and trans-jordan), viz., the defence of aden, where a remarkable degree of success has already been achieved, though 1 do not wish to claim that our troubles with the imam are by any means finally ended; and .     .(ii) has also begun to take a larger part in the military controlof the sudan (see also paragraph 9 below);(c) that concurrently it has been necessary to provide new units for co-operation with the navy and army, in accordance with approved policy.3. but obviously, with the force thus steadily expanding in a number of directions and simultaneously taking over these new responsibilities, these progressive reductions cannot continue indefinitely, and the time has come when, search as i may, i can no longer contrive economies to meet at once maturing capital liabilities, the growing maintenance costs of the new squad-rons and the need for a steady process of re-equipment to which i return below. i cannot make bricks without straw, and some modest rise in air estimates next year is inevitable. even if the cabinet were prepared yet again to throw the whole air force programme into the melting-pot, the effect on next year&apos;s expenditure would be negligible. such a step can, however, i hope, be dismissed as outside practical politics, since it could only result in the mutilation of a scheme which, to be efficient, must be a balanced whole, whilst it would be bound to bring in its train a great deal of consequential waste. moreover, in a few years&apos; time (since we are to-day fifth amongst the world&apos;s air. powers)&apos;j there would inevitably follow a scare-and one founded on solid facts accompanied by an unanswerable public demand for fresh expansion at short notice. such a sequence of events, as the experience of the past decade has clearly proved, would not be economy, but the reverse. $4. to illustrate my argument i read out to the cabinet a series of figures comparing the trend of british and foreign air expenditure since 1925. i was asked.to incorporate these in a memorandum, after agreeing them with the departments concerned, and this i have now done vide the tables in appendix i. i should add that in tables a, b and c i have included expenditure on civil aviation throughout, as i was asked to do. i have also included in a separate table d a comparative statement of expenditure on subsidies to civil aviation here and abroad. the figures for foreign naval and military expenditure on which these calculations are based are all taken from the published budgets of the countries concerned and have been agreed semi-officially between the air staff and the naval and general staffs.   the figures used for national expenditure in the* Owing to the introduction of an Appropriation in Aid of the cost of the. Fleet Air Arm in Navy Estimates in 1925 and the transfer of Middle East expenditure from Colonial Office to Air Votes in 1928, gross estimates are, in the absence of elaborate compensatory calculations, the only p.Ta ficable standard of comparison over the period as a whole.I may add, however, that, a comparison based either on net estimates (adjusted to take account of the above-mentioned m difications of form) or on actual expenditure in the. several years would give an even more favourable percentage, i.e.\ show a yet larger reduction.t . 19.1,35,000-gross&apos;&apos;,   I 0.250,000 net.% See paragraph 0 below and the table in Appendix IT. .....5 For example, even, for the present expansion the Royal Air Force has had to repurchase, at greatly enhanced prices, sites;which were surrendered only a few years ago as a result of the then Cabinet&apos;s short-sighted, policy of scrapping air units wholesale. We have had in consequence to incur great - odium with the Public Accounts Committee and other bodies, an odium which should by rights belong to the Coalition Government, and not to the Air Ministry -
Other considerations affecting Air Esti-tnates.No reduction iu Air Esti-mates is possible as a result of the Kellogg Pact. Our air strength vis-a-vis that of the principal Foreign Air Powers. We are to-day fifth in terms of first-line machines.several countries have similarly been obtained from the Treasury. My calculations do not, of course, pretend to be scientifically correct to the last penny. It would, owing to differences in systems of national accounts, take a horde of experts several months to achieve anything like completely accurate results if, indeed, it is possible at all. In this connection I would draw particular attention to the foot-note to Table C in Appendix I. All such adjustments have been made, however, as are necessary to show a picture which is broadly in perspective.I have not reproduced the actual figures in pounds, dollars, francs, and lire, on which the percentages are based, since this would mean printing an intricate and voluminous series of statistics which, not being comparable, would by themselves have very little meaning. They are, however, available for reference if required. I will only add that, to avoid overstating the case, I have deliberately, at a number of doubtful points/loaded the scales against the British figures.My colleagues will see that, as I told them in December  (1.) Gross Air Estimates have shewn a decline each successive year since 1925 (I have taken this as the basic year since it is the first year in which the present Government were responsible for the presentation of Estimates), and are now 10 per cent, below the figure for that year. During this period air expenditure in Italy, France, and the U.S.A. has gone up by leaps and bounds and the latest figures are 28 per cent., 92 per cent., and 126 per cent, respectively above those for 1925. (2.) We are in this country spending a markedly smaller proportion of our total defence expenditure on &quot;air&quot; than either the U.S.A., France or Italy. This is the more noteworthy when we consider that (a.) The British Empire as a whole (as opposed to these islands which, with its coming, have lost once and for all their time-honoured insular security) stands to gain much more than any other country from the development of air power.We were the first nation to institute a separate Air Ministry, ii-jthough both France and Italy have now followed our example.The Royal Air Force has successfully undertaken novel defence responsibilities (Iraq, Palestine, Transjordan and Aden) of a character and on a scale which no foreign air service has attempted, with very large resultant economies to the Exchequer.(3.) We are also spending a smaller proportion of our national expendi-ture as a whole on &quot;air&quot; than either the U.S.A., France, or Italy.I do not want to press this last point unduly, but my colleagues will, I am sure, agree that the calculation is not without significance, even if it would be dangerous to dogmatise unduly in the light of it. I submit that these figures are very striking.5. My colleagues may like me to set down on paper some of the other considerations which I placed before them at the same time as affecting the difficult problem of Air Estimates.6. I should be only too glad to mark the acceptance of the Kellogg Pact by a reduction in Air Estimates, as the Chancellor would have me do, if this were practicable. Unfortunately^ however, the Pact is not of much assistance to me in my immediate difficulties.In the first place, though the Royal Air Force is undoubtedly the most efficient air service in the world, we are to-day, in terms of first-line strength, not first, second, or third, but fifth of the Great Powers, Vis-a-ms kr&amp;nce the leading air power of the world, the ratio is roughly 8 (British) to id (French)-a somewhat disturbing disparity. Moreover, a greater propor-tion of our squadrons are overseas. The ratio at .home, is less than 1 (British) to 2 (French). I yield to none of my colleagues in the desuejQ disarm, both for disarmaments sake, and to secure 11(6.)(c.)the reductions in our
Our Tery modest ezpan-sion scheme must pro-oeed, but we should endeavour to obtain an agreement for air parity between Great Britain, Francs and Italy.ational expenditure which are so urgently required, but in such a position I suggest we simply cannot afford to let reasonable security go altogether by the board.   We have, in fact, as it seems to me, no option but-.(a) to proceed slowly and steadily with our present very modest programme, which does not, of course, aim at giving us anything like a one-power standard (though there is a strong body of opinion in this country which, looking at the vital importance of the air to the British Empire, thinks we should have no less) and--(5) simultaneously to endeavour to bring about some agreement for air parity between ourselves, France, and Italy as the principal European air powers a course which I have, in the interests of disarmament, urged for a long time past (see CP. 170 (28) of May 1928), but which does not to date seem to have made much progress.It occurs to me that the Italian intimation, in their reply to our note about Naval Disarmament, that they would be glad to disarm on a basis of parity, gives us a peg on which we might perhaps open discussions with them and renew discussions with the French. I was, moreover, greatly interested to note in a recent memorandum of the Foreign Secretary s that Signor Grandi informed him at Lugano in December that &quot; Italy recognised that France must be allowed to make special provision for her vast and scattered Colonial Empire.&quot; This argument will obviously apply a fortiori to us. The Foreign Secretary alone, however, can say when the moment is opportune for us to move.We are in a position of such great inferiority to-day, that if agreement is achieved we should, none the less, have to complete our existing programme, but at least we might then hope to avoid the need for any further expansion which, without agreement, looks inevitable.7. In this connection I should be failing in my duty if I did not warn Large Italian and French the Cabinet that France and Italy-signatories of the Kellogg Pact like ^m&quot;&apos;,i,Bptt&quot; ourselves have both large programmes of expansion tabled. For the Italians have never renounced their scheme, approved by Royal Decree in 1925, for the ultimate development of a force with a first-line strength of 1,600 machines, though it is to be hoped financial difficulties at least will continue to prove a delaying factor in its execution; and M. Laurent Eynac, the new French Air Minister, only a few weeks ago, when the French Air Estimates for 1929 (which are already 92 per cent, above the 1925 figure) were under discussion in the Chamber, stated that it was his Governments firm intention to expand the French Air Service from its present strength of 154 squadrons to 201 squadrons, or from 1,300 to approximately 1,960 first-line machines against a present British figure of 780 odd. Indeed, the seriousness with which the French have this autumn put in hand the reorganisation of their air services is a factor to be reckoned with.8.   I think, too, my colleagues would wish me to bring to their notice striking  ah-^ the really astonishing boom which is taking place in aviation in every form       &apos; *in the U.S.A., where air expenditure for the coming year will be, as above stated, no less than 126 per cent, above the 1925 figure, having reached the staggering total of nearly  30,000,000. This is the Federal Budget figure and is exclusive of expenditure by the States and Municipalities. The President, in his official Message transmitting the Budget for the coming year, actually devotes more space to air, which is one of his five main headings, than to any other subject; I have had a few extracts from his remarks reproduced in Appendix III, as I think my colleagues will be interested to read them. This vast Federal expenditure is paralleled by fin amazing degree of activity in the local development of air lines and air ports, both commercially and municipally. Three months ago there were in the U.S.A. 386 municipally-owned and 340 commercially-owned air ports, and a further 890 were projected (official figures). I have just been informed by cable that the Department of Commerce estimate that these air ports will, when completed, represent a capital outlay of no less a sum than  41,000,000 (200,000,000 dollars), and it is a reasonable deduction that more than half this amount will represent municipal expenditure.I am not suggesting we should emulate these figures.  Indeed, as I haveenfcs in the tj.s.A. Air expenditure will reach a figure of nearly  30 million in 1929-30.
often pointed out, it is in the Empire at large, and not in these islands which are ill-suited to it, that British air transport has almost illimitable scope; and even so I make no doubt that the Americans are trying to develop civil aviation too fast. At the same&quot;time, our provision for civil air develop-ment to date looks very niggardly in comparison, and I cannot feel surprised at the criticism which has been levelled at me on this score from all quarters of the House.* I hope, however, that the scheme. I am now considering for the inauguration, within the next twelve months or so (pace the Chancellor of the Exchequer), of the second of the great trunk Imperial air lines, viz that from Egypt to South Africa, will do something to allay this criticism at the cost of a very modest expenditure from Imperial Funds.T^wtal ^ntSuouBiy J- Jut it is not mainly because other countries are, despite the in aotion in theatres Kellogg Pact, largely increasing their air expenditure that that instrument Keuogg Parlfs no? has        bearing on the situation..run. it was engaged The fact is that the Royal Air Force is very far from being a mere w0dLetincnheOantrls insurance against major European wars. It is almost continuously on in Z928. active service in theatres such as Iraq, Palestine, Trans Jordan, Aden, india the Sudan and Somaliland, where a large proportion of its existing squadrons are stationed, and where the writ of the Kellogg Pact does not unfortunately run. I am sure my colleagues will not think I am not fully sensible of the magnificent work done by the Navy and Army in maintaining order and ensuring the continuance of peace throughout the world-for example, Shanghai is typical of the kind of situation where the Royal Air Force has been, and must, always be, quite definitely the junior partner if I remind them that our air squadrons overseas are, and are likely to continue to be, in action from year to year to a far larger extent^ than any other branch of the Imperial Forces. We had, for example, active operations in no less than four distinct theatres in the calendar year just ended, viz. :  (1) in Iraq;(2) in the Aden Protectorate; . (3) on the North-West Frontier of India; and (4) in the Sudan.I have not previously brought some of these operations specifically to the notice of the Cabinet and a few particulars about them may not be out of place, for some of them have been on a considerable scale.(i.) Iraq. (i) Operations in Iraq.These operations commenced on the 11th January, 1928, and terminated at the end of April. They were on an extensive front and the air units in Iraq were repeatedly in action against the raiders from advanced bases in the desert. At times the situation was very threatening, and a general invasion of Iraq, accompanied by a Jehad, appeared imminent. The operations were strikingly successful, in that, both by con-consolidating the wavering Iraqi tribes, which looked like going over to Nejd, and deterring, by means of the severe punishment inflicted, other Akhwan tribes from throwing in their lot with, the raiders, they prevented what might have been a widespread desert conflagration on a really dangerous scale. Ibn Saud entered frequent protests with all the vehemence of one who knows he is in the wrong, alleging, inter alia, that air action was &quot;inhuman.&quot;! It is an interesting commentary on the insincerity of this-allegation and the effectiveness of the action taken that he has since been actively negotiating for two British pilots to enter his employ, but makes-it a sine qua non that, &quot;in the event of internal disturbance, they shall be obliged to perform such effective service as the Government requests as m normal course &quot; (Article 9 of terms of employment). Our diplomatic repre-sentative at Jeddah reports that,, if this condition as regards the employ--   . ment of British personnel for the suppression of disorders within the hejaz and Nejd is not acceptable, Ibn Saud will abandon the whole project, and the Foreign Office have accordingly agreed that it should be accepted.* Table p in Appendix I gives some striking comparative figures of expenditure on. subsidies to civil aviation in this country and abroad. &apos; i - i  vt I need, not,-I am. sure, remind. my colleagues of the numerous, occasions on. winch it-has, been established that air control is more humane arid likely to be productive of, smaller-casualties alike to the enemy and our own forces than any other form of action.
The desert terrain over which these operations were carried out is arreh, inhospitable and difficult to the last degree, and the climatic&apos; con-itioris were exceedingly trying-cold and wet, with snow at times, in the arly stages, giving way later on to great heat and heavy dust storms!From January to April the three squadrons principally engaged flew over 6,000 hours in the course of the operations. One of them was engaged almost wholly in transport work and conveyed, forward to the desert bases approximately 450 tons of miscellaneous stores during the period. At the height of the operations the nine machines of this single squadron carried as much as 5 tons daily. It may be of interest to record that the mileage above-mentioned represents about 80 per cent, of the mileage flown, and the tonnage carried by the transport squadron is about 75 per cent, of the total freight* carried, by British commercial air services in Europe in the whole of 1927.This is not the first time that the Royal Air Force, in addition to maintaining Internal order, which is the role for which it was originally cast, has undertaken the defence of Iraq against external aggression. It was equally successful in the autumn of 1924 in repelling the incursion of Turkish regulars on. the extreme northern frontier. Despite these and similar difficulties, reinforcements have never been asked for throughout and the garrison has been continuously reduced. Its cost has been brought Economy effected by tie down from nearly  21 million in 1921 to  If millions in 1928. The last nseof theai*arm-of the Imperial infantry battalions (there were 33 in 1921 and, as the only alternative to air control,, a minimum ground garrison of 12 battalions was envisaged in addition to 6 Royal Air Force squadrons) left the country in November 1928, and the number of air squadrons has been progressively brought down from 8 to 5, and, if there is no serious recrudescence of the Akhwan trouble this winter, will be further reduced to 4 in 1929.The Royal Air Force was in action on two other occasions in 1928 in May against a brigand Sheikh in the Hammar Lake District near Basrah, and at the end of December when there was a further small Akhwan raid and severe punishment was inflicted on the raiders.(2.) Operations at Aden. (2.) Aden.The Royal Air Force took over the defence of Aden in the spring of 1928. In February of that year the Imam of the Yemen, who by a process of steady encroachment since 1919 had occupied large areas of Protectorate territory (the nearest Zeidi post having been pushed forward to within 50 miles of Aden), perpetrated the culminating outrage of kidnapping two Sheikhs under British protection.Air operations were accordingly undertaken against his frontier garrisons over the period 21st February to 25th March, when the Imam asked for a truce, and surrendered his two captives as an earnest of his good intentions.A truce was accorded him, one of its conditions being that he should evacuate Dala, an important town in the occupied Protectorate territory, by the 20th June. The Imam, however, had not withdrawn the Zeidi garrison from Dala by this date, and accordingly, after a demonstration flight by a formation of eight aircraft over the principal towns of the Yemen had given a clear warning that, if Dala was not evacuated by the 24th June, air action would be renewed, intensive operations were commenced on the 25th June against the Zeidi garrisons in the vicinity of the border and military barracks in certain towns in the interior of the Yemen.The success of these operations produced a marked effect from the outset. When they were about to begin, the talk throughout the Yemen was of an immediate advariceby *the Imam&apos;s forces on Lahej (which lies on the direct road to Aden), and the inhabitants of the former town were in a state &quot;of, panic, being unable to believe that twelve,aircraft could possibly resist a powerful enemy, who was concentrating, along TOO miles of frontier  much less exert effective pressure.on the Imam, seated seven days&apos;.march to the north. Within a few days hopefulness succeeded panic, and the tribes, who had for years past appeared to lack alike; the will and the power . to eject the invaders, began sporadically to rise against the Zeidi garrisons. This movement, once,begun, steadily gathered momentum, arid on the 13th July the Amir,of Dala, who had. spent 8 years as, an exile in Lahej,* I.e., goods as opposed to passenger traffic.
reoccupied that town under cover of an intensive air attack at the head of his tribesmen. Almost all the Zeidi garrisons were, as a consequence, withdrawn into Yemen territory. Three weeks&apos; bombing had thus compelled the Imam to comply with the conditions laid down, and air action was accordingly suspended to enable him to open negotiations should he desire to do so. At the end of July, however, one of the Zeidi commanders again took the offensive against the Protectorate tribes in his neighbourhood, and local air action was resumed with the result that further posts were evacuated by the enemy. By the end of August it became clear that the Imam was in a more pacific mood, and it was learned that he had actually issued orders that the Zeidi garrison commanders in the south of the Yemen were to refrain altogether from raids into Protectorate territory. Opera-tions were, therefore, terminated.Thus, in two months, by air action undertaken by a single squadron (which flew 900 hours under arduous and exacting conditions in the course of the operations), the Imam had been forced to evacuate territory of which he had been for years in wrongful, but virtually uncontested, occupation.E0uTeOofyth*6atrtrmshe cost Q^ these operations (over and above the normal maintenanceuseo e air arm. Gosis 0f fchg uriit concerned) may be put at about  8,500. Previous to the Royal Air Force taking over the defence of Aden, it had been estimated that to occupy Dala (which was regarded as the only practical military objective) with ground forces would take a Division, less If Brigades of Field Artillery, and pack-transport to the extent of 7,000 camels. The total cost of such a campaign was put at from  6 to  10 million (see CP. 377 (26) ).(s.) indi*. (3.) Operations in India.In November 1928, as a result of general defiance of the authority of the Government of India, culminating in the kidnapping of two British Hindu subjects, two sections of the North-West Frontier tribe of the Mahsuds (the Giga Khel and the Nekzan Khel) were warned that, if they did not return the captives and mend their ways, air action would be taken against them.They remained recalcitrant, and, accordingly, intensive air action was taken against the villages of the Giga Khel section over a period of two days.As a result the peccant tribal sections submitted unconditionally, and this complete and immediate success prevented any further spread of unrest.Similar minor operations were carried out with equal success in Mohmand territory in 1927, when there was a threat of serious unrest as a result of a leader appearing who preached a Jehad against us and endeavoured to detach certain clans from their British allegiance. A large hostile lashkar was attacked by the Royal Air Force and dispersed, and an ugly situation was thus restored. Economy effected by the The cost of these operations (over and above the normal maintenance use of the air arm.     costg of tlie unitg engaged) was about  1,700, and the whole operation maybe contrasted with the elaborate measures which had to be taken to restore a somewhat similar situation in 1908, which deteriorated until it was ultimately necessary for the Government of India to organise a Mohmand Field Force, consisting of three Infantry Brigades, Divisional Troops, &amp;c, at a corresponding cost of over  139,000.(4.) Sudan. (4.) Operations in the Sudan.As a result of serious unrest in certain areas in the Sudan, and particularly the murder of the District Commissioner of the Eastern District, Bahr-el-Ghazal, Captain V. H. Fergusson, together with a Greek merchant and sixteen native carriers on the 15th December, 1927, two distinct ground expeditions, in both of which the Royal Air Force actively participated, were undertaken against the recalcitrant sections of the continuer tribe. These expeditions lasted from December 1927 to February 1928; they were under the command of military officers, and both successfully achieved their object.As there is some divergence of opinion as to whether the Royal Air Force was employed to the best advantage in the course of these operations
&apos; and also as to the extent to which aircraft contributed to their success, I will confine myself to quoting from an annexure to a recent despatch from-the Governor-General of the Sudan. In this annexure Sir John Maffey cites the following extract from the report of the Officer Commanding the expedition, in which the most efficacious use was made of the air arm :-&quot;The aircraft were without a doubt the deciding factor of the patrol. Without them the operations might have dragged on for weeks, if not for months. There is no doubt that they struck terror into the Nuers and completely unnerved them. The Nuers thought that they were safe from the Government, and being bombed and machine-gunned was a great shock. The utility of aircraft for communication purposes cannot,be exaggerated.&quot;10. The recent operations for the evacuation of civilians from Kabul Evacuation operations are yet another illustration of the way in which, with the passing years, new at Kabul-uses, pacific and protective as well as warlike and repressive, continue to be found for the Air Arm. It is a melancholy but interesting reflection to consider what a difference the existence of aircraft might have made at other epochs in the chequered history of our relations with Afghanistan-and also in the tragic course of events in India at the time of the Mutiny, with its appalling sacrifice of the lives of non-combatants, women and children. The machines which in the first instance established and maintained contact with the Legation when all other means of communication had broken down were repeatedly under fire, and the conditions under which the successive evacuations (totalling in all 140 persons of ten different nationalities) were so successfully carried out were arduous in the extreme. I am sure my colleagues will agree with me that the units concerned deserve great credit for their fine achievement in the cause of imperilled humanity, and it is an interesting reminder of the mobility of air power, given a properly organised chain of aerodromes and landing grounds, that the troop-carrying machines which did the bulk of the work flew over 2,500 miles from Iraq to the N.W. frontier of India for this specific purpose. There could be no better illustration of the fundamental need for securing for the Royal Air Force that liberty of movement which is essential to its: efficient and economical employment. I may add that the Royal Air Force has also inaugurated an air service between Peshawar and Kabul, and 1,600 lbs. of mail were carried on the first occasion. *11. In the preceding paragraphs I have explained how little the Kellogg Pact bears on our problems, but my colleagues in general and the Chancellor in particular may well ask me whether we have sufficiently taken into account the ruling that we have an &quot;accumulative &quot; 10-year period of peace before us.It is only by stretching this ruling almost beyond the limit of what is permissible that we have succeeded in getting Air Estimates down to their present level. The Royal Air Force is no &quot;luxury &quot; service, maintained on a war footing, armed cap*-a-pie against all emergencies. We have taken, and are continuing to take, risk after risk in the cause of economy. We are not visualising a major war in 10, 20 or 30 years. We have no war reserves. We maintain only those &quot;wastage &quot; reserves which are necessary for day to day replacement, and even here we have experimentally been running on so fine a margin that at the present moment there are actual shortages in various units and more, I regret to say, are in prospect. I have made large successive cuts in Estimates to meet my colleagues&apos; desire for economy, and yet further cuts in actual expenditure, even on these reduced estimates (particularly in the last two years nearly  ^ million in 1927 and  -I million this year), to assist the Chancellor in his special difficulties. As a result 5 squadrons will shortly be temporarily unable to maintain their full strength of first-line machines-an inefficient and uneconomical situation, for it means a waste of man power with personnel standing by idle. Other squadrons are still using obsolete (and in one or two cases actual war-time) types of machine, a state of affairs which I should be hard put to it to defend, if the sotto voce criticism which is already muttering in various quarters were to be taken up publicly in the Press or in Parliament.* This service has now been temporarily suspended owing- to the latest developments in Kabul.[18729] cIn framing -Air Esti-mates full account lias for years past been taken of the &quot;No war for 10 years&quot; decision of the Cabinet No attempt is being made to organisa the Royal Air Force on a basis of immediate readiness for a major. war.

The vital importance to the Royal Air Foroe of its technical equip-ment. Not only its lighting efficiency, but the lives and limbs of its Hying personnel from day to day in time of peace, are dependent on the pro-vision of up-to-date types of machine and engine.Conclusion,I may add that at the time of the operations in Southern Iraq in the early months of 1928 there resulted even in this theatre a shortage of machines which caused us a good deal of uneasiness and might have had most serious consequences. As it happened, however, it was possible to make this good by the delivery by air of machines from Egypt, where the situation was fortunately sufficiently quiet to enable the Air Officer Commanding to face with equanimity a temporary reduction in his first-line strength. Nor at the present moment, when there seems a risk of further trouble from the Akhwan one small raid has already had to be dealt with by air action is the machine situation in Iraq altogether free from anxiety.12. This brings me to my last point. I cannot too strongly emphasise that it is essential that the Royal Air Force shall be adequately equipped with efficient up-to-date types of aircraft. I fully appreciate the vital importance to the Navy of a steady replacement programme, and to the Army of such a measure of mechanisation as the march of military progress dictates. But I do venture to point out that the Royal Air Force is even more dependent on its technical equipment being efficient and up-to-date  and the life of an aeroplane is short than either of the older services. The ding-dong race for superiority in different types of machine on the Western front during the war taught us this lesson at the cost of a deplorably heavy sacrifice of human life. As one type of fighter succeeded another, the advantage was first with us, then with the Germans, and this alternating process was several times repeated, until the German designers had shot their final bolt in 1917, and at long last we established a decisive technical mastery. This was one of the outstanding lessons of the late war, and should not be forgotten in peace. I have already pointed out that a large proportion of the Royal Air Force squadrons are always under more or less active service conditions- that we had, for example, active operations in four distinct theatres in 1928. In all four theatres the main danger to which our pilots were exposed was some defect in aircraft and engine  a forced landing being apt to entail disaster. But even in the case of units stationed in this country, in the Royal Air Force alone of the fighting services, the lives and limbs of its personnel in the performance of their daily duties under normal peace conditions are entirely dependent on the adequacy of their technical equipment. I am sure my colleagues will agree that the vote from which this equipment is provided it is by far the heaviest item of Air Force expenditure and accounts for the bulk of the small increase for which I am asking next year cannot safely be stinted. I need hardly remind them of the legitimate agitation which took place in 1922 over the defective equipment of the Royal Air Force in India; the situation that actually did come about at that time in India must never again be allowed to reproduce itself, either in this country or overseas. It is unfortunate no doubt that war stocks are exhausted. Other countries, however, have the same problem, as the President of the United States emphasises in his current &quot;Message transmitting the Budget,&quot;* but the necessity for an increasing expenditure on new aircraft and engines must be resolutely faced here as abroad.13.   But for the sympathetic interest which my colleagues shewed when outlined my difficulties to them orally at the last meeting of the Cabinet,and their specific request that&apos; I should circulate a memorandum on thesubject, I should not have ventured to set down on paper so full a statementof our problems.   I can, however, at least claim that, during the past fouryears, despite the many difficulties that have throughout this periodconfronted the Royal Air Force, and the mass of papers which the cabinet has had to digest on almost every aspect of expenditure, civil, naval andmilitary, I have hitherto not troubled my colleagues with a single memo-randum on Air Estimates. .    . ttS. H.Air Ministry, January 14, 1929.* &quot; This increase (in defence expenditure), however, is more apparent than real, for in these prior years the defence establishments have had the use of surplus supplies left over trom tne war. As these reserves have become depleted, it has become necessary to increase the casn provision to take their place.&quot;

The demands of this service, while large, have been adequately met. The 5-year programme for the Army and Navy is approaching completion. Provision is made in these estimates for the third year increment of the Army and the fourth year increment of the Navy, and it is a fair assumption that at the end of 1931 the Navy will have a well-balanced fleet of 1,000* airplanes, while at the end of 1932 the Army will be in possession of 1,800* planes in proper proportion as to types. The necessary housing and other construction for&apos; the Army and Navy air forces are also provided for. The expansion of air activities, however, is by no means confined to the Army and Navy. The Department of Commerce, the Coast Guard, and the Department of Agriculture are playing their parts in the developing air programme, as is the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. . . . These estimates carry 6,427,260 dollars for the Department of Commerce to carry on its important task in connection with commercial aviation. This estimate contemplates, among other items, the construction of 4,000 additional miles of lighted airways. . . .The rapid and legitimate expansion of our air service, military and commercial, is an achievement in which we can all take pride. Without artificial stimulation this extraordinary new factor in national defence and commerce has grown from modest and discouraging beginnings into a strong, healthy, promising national activity. To-day we have more airplane manufactories than we have automobile factories. To-day air mail lines cross the heavens in a rapidly increasing network of speedy communication. Freight and passenger-carrying airplanes are increasing, and a growing demand is seen for airplanes for private use. The generous contribu-tion made by the United States Government to this great and growing activity has been justified by the progress made and the results achieved.&quot;t This figure is given with reserve, since our information as to the actual strength of the Russian air service is not very reliable. ,   .* These are not figures of first-line strength, but of total numbers of aircraft on charge, i&apos;.c, they are not comparable to the figures in Appendix ii. They foreshadow, however, a large increase in first-line strength by 1932.APPENDIX II.
