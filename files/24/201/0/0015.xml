S DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS^BRTTANNIC majesty&apos;s S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO        V?CABINET.EQUAL PAY PGR MEN AND &quot;OMEN IN THE TEACHING &apos;   &quot; PROFESSION. 7Memorandum b?7- the President,  Board of Education.With reference to the Chancellor of the ExchequerTs Memorandum (CP.  8 (29)),  it may be useful to explain how the demand for Equal Pay for men and women affects the teaching profession.The cost of Equal Pay in the teaching service would probably amount to about  5-g- millions, of which between  3 and  4 millions would fall on taxes and the rest on rates.Teachers&apos;  salaries are governed by an agreement concluded between the local authorities and the teachers In pursuance of an award by Lord Burrham. in 1925.      That agreement cannot be terminated until March 1931, and thereafter it will continue from year to year tinless denounced by one of the parties to It.      If the Government or House of Commons were to undertake to conduct an inquiry into the best way of giving effect to the principle of Equal Pay they would,  in effect, be announcing&apos;their intention of bringing pressure to bear upon the lecal authorities ana the teachers te denounce the agreement at the earliest possible date.      Such action would be strongly rosented both by the local authorities and by the teaching profession.      Moreover, if the local authorities were thus to be forced to denounce the old agreement, they wouldC R S T. ^ 15  (29).
certainly refuse to conclude a new one on a much more expensive basis.      The principle of Equal Pay could, therefore, only be embodied in a new agreement at the cost of a compensating reduction of salaries all round.There is no force behind the demand  for Equal Pay in the teaching profession.      It is  confined to the National Union of YJomen Teachers, which has a membership of probably not more than 10,000.      It is obvious from what has been said above that any attempt to apply the principle at the present moment would be intensely distasteful to the National Union of Teachers,E.P.Board of Education, S.W.I. 25th January,  1929.
