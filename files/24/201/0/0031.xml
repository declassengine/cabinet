SECRET.Copt No.CP. 31 (29)THE CABINET.THE INDIAN CONTRIBUTION TO HOME EFFECTIVE CHARGES OF THE BRITISH ARMY.MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR. (Former papers CP. 25 (29), 1 (29), 361 (28), 347 (28), &amp;c.)1. I hope the Cabinet will maintain the view which the majority held when this_15question was discussed in November last at their meeting (52 (28)), that India should pay an    India increased contribution towards the cost of the British troops in India, for there is nothing     6330 new in the telegram from the Viceroy (CP. 1 (29) ) ; every argument used has been repeated during every previous enquiry.2. From paragraph 15 of the telegram it is clear that if the contribution to the Army is increased by  250,000 and to the Air Force by  60,000, it would be possible for India from 1930-31 onwards to find the money out of the present Indian Army estimates of R. 55 crores, provided that the British services do not insist upon the arrears from 1926 being paid immediately, but are content to take the arrears by an annuity of  65,000. The opposition in India will be disarmed, or at least reduced, by the total of the Indian estimates not being increased.3. As a compromise, and in order to meet as far as possible Indian views, I am willing (a) To accept an addition of  200,000 a year and the War Office share of  65,000on account of arrears from 1st April, 1926, for each of the 3 years ending 1st April, 1930, 1931 and 1932.(b) After the Simon Commission has reported, but not as part of its proceedings, torefer the questions whether any, and if so, what contribution for 1933 and subsequent years shall be paid by India, to an independent Tribunal to be set up by the two Governments.(c) That the contribution towards the cost of sea transport should cease.I am not willing that the Tribunal shall be the Simon Commission for the reasons already given to the Lord Chancellors Committee, but I am willing that the two Governments should be guided by the Simon Report in finally settling the personnel of the Committee, so that the decision may be a &quot; sequel to&quot; the Simon enquiry (see paragraph 1, Viceroy&apos;s telegram, 19th January, 1929, in CP. 25 (29)).I do not now discuss the terms of reference but it is clear that, in substitution for or in addition to some of those suggested by the Viceroy, the enquiry should include the questions of the cost to Great Britain of the long service army necessitated by the garrison in India and the replacement cost of other troops raised by India if British troops were not available.L. W.-E.The War Office,9*A February, 1929.(B29/17)   100  2/29  W.O.P.   4083Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1929.
