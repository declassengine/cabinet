Printed for the Cabinet.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   28CP. 43 (29).(Also Paper No. B.R. 83.)CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS. (Circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)Sir E. Howard to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Private and Very Confidential.)My dear Chamberlain, Washington, January 31, 1929.I CANNOT thank you enough for your long letter of the 6th January and for letting me know, as you say, what is in your mind, about the vexed question of a possible agreement with this country re Maritime Law in war time and the naval limitation question, which so largely depends on a settlement of the former.As regards any distinction between public and private wars, it certainly seems to me that the Lord Chancellors objection to any distinction of this kind being incorporated in a treaty is final, It seems clear that, as the Lord Chancellor says, wars in future will be, if the Covenant and the Kellogg Pact have any meaning at all, either &quot; public &quot; wars or wars waged in defiance of treaty pledges, and for any country to incorporate such a distinction in any agreement would certainly appear like contemplating the possibility of a breach of faith.In my opinion, the second objection, viz., that such a distinction in a treaty or agreement would appear to be a recognition by the United States of the Covenant of the League, is also so strong that any agreement containing such a clause would inevitably fail to pass the Senate, and it is no good thinking of it as matters stand here at present. I am surprised at Philip Kerr making any such suggestion. I have the greatest respect and admiration for his intelligence, but this makes me think that he is at times rather more academic than practical.Now I come to paragraph 5 of your letter with its direct question: &quot; Has anyone in the State Department or Administration thought out American interests and American policy ? &quot; I agree with you that the answer to both questions is, up to date, probably &quot;No.&quot; I also agree that in this country people move both under the influence of a generous but uninformed sentiment for peace and goodwill and under the influence of some powerful and wholly selfish national interest. But what makes this still more disconcerting is that they do not always do so, as you say, at one moment under.the one, at the next moment under the other. They continually act from both motives at the same time. In one and the same breath they will all declare for a reign of peace on earth, and also for maintaining American national interests by force; above all, for not taking any steps that will tie their hands as to their right to use force when they feel so &quot; dispoged,&quot; as Mrs. Gamp says. I also agree with your interpretation of the genesis of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War. As regards your question in paragraph 8, viz., who is to call us to order, if we violate the Kellogg Pact and the United States stands neutral and insists on its right to-furnish us with everything we require? I again agree, &quot;no one.&quot; Had there been any obligation to refrain from furnishing supplies to a violator of the pact, that instrument would not have stood the ghost of a chance of passing the Senate. The ratification of the pact by the Senate almost unanimously is but another instance of what I said above-the desire of this country to appear as the champion of peace and goodwill, while at the same time retaining freedom to act as it thinks fit for its own interests in any moment of crisis.Perhaps public opinion may change in regard to this. But that time is still a long way Off, and we have to take people as we find them and make the best of it.I can therefore only guess at what is likely to be the American attitude if we have to discuss with the United States Government the question of belligerent fights at sea.4760   [18860]
.\. [ Iiviiiy telegram No. 67 and in my despatch No. 206 I have&apos;tried to explain that there &quot;will probably be a divergence of opinion between the Government and; the Senate, which still respects the popular theory regarding American policy, namely, that it has always supported neutral rights to the extreme limit, &apos;This may be con&apos; cisejy expressed in the article Benjamin Franklin tried to get Great Britain to put into&apos; the treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain &apos;after&apos; the revolutionary war  &apos;     \&apos;&apos; &apos;       ;&apos; &quot;&apos;,&apos;  &quot; ;   *      - i&apos;&apos;&apos; All merchants or traders with their unarmed vessels employed &apos; in&quot; ,:     -commerce, exchanging the products of different nations, and thereby rendering - :,   the necessary convenience and comforts of human life more easily to obtain and more general, shall be allowed to pass freely unmolested.&quot;The Government, on the other hand, will be more likely to be influenced to a certain degree by the Navy Department and to favour a more liberal interpretation of belligerent rights.,i,., vAt- a guess, I should say that we may reach an agreement with the-United States Government about 1.-- Visit and search in port provided we agree to a time limit within whichvessels may be held up in port. 2. Limits of effective blockade being considerably  extended beyond those hitherto recognised. ,.. 3.- Right of belligerents to take off contraband consigned to their enemies, and possibly also consigned to neutrals, provided there is good evidence of intention to re-ship to an enemy country, i.e., recognition of doctrine of continuous voyage.4. Absolute prohibition of sinking enemy or neutral vessels without first saving :-   all on board, and probably prohibition of sinking merchant ships at all. This would, I take it, really be a great advantage to us.If my guess is right, the question found which all our debates will turn is: &quot;What is in future to be regarded as contraband? &quot;   Here all Americans will undoubtedly want a very large free list, the basis of which will be all goods but munitions of war, in accordance with FranklnVs and Jefferson&apos;s thesis.   Now, it seems to me that if Great Britain could have her food supply in time of war -guaranteed by agreement with the United States, and, better still, by international agreement, it ought to take an immense load of responsibility off our own navy, which would be freer to conduct,operations of war if it did not have to convoy food ships.  Should we, therefore, have any insurmountable&apos; objection to putting all food-stuffs on the free list?  A food blockade such as we conducted against Germany is a long and weary process and may well cut both ways.   If we ever for a short time , lost command of the sea, it would be effective much more rapidly against us than against any continental Power.   Therefore (I have to write all this very shortly and without going into detailed arguments), I feel we might admit all food-stuffs, either ,r.aw or.prepared, as free.,, : But you will say what we want to get is a definition of contraband that will &quot;suit us. Speaking very generally, I should say that we ought to aim for all arms and munitions of war and raw materials, especially minerals and fuel substances, that go to make modern arms and munitions of war, and chemicals for explosives, poison gases, &amp;c. I doubt, however, if we could include a substance like cotton, which the United States would never agree to put on the contraband list.If we were to propose a contraband list on the above lines I think it not impossible that we might reach an agreement with the United States Government. It is further, not impossible that even the Senate, if they had the situation explained by the naval and military authorities, might agree to this. We must never lose sight of the fact that the Senate always has an eye on a possible conflict with Mexico or Japan.Although Hankey&apos;s most interesting memorandum on the subject of Philip Kerr&apos;s suggestion re&quot; public and private wars &quot; is, &quot;I think, put out of the picture by the Lord Chancellors criticism of that suggestion and the fact that, at present, the American Senate would surely have none of it, that memorandum contains one very important point, which is that, in a League war against a violator of the Covenant, there should-be no -European neutralsrexcept-Russia, to whom American goods could be consigned. This makes things much simpler. Of course, if the League breaks up, this safeguard would disappear. But then there would be general chaos and it is hardly worth while attempting to make international law for a state of chaos.
,0^ things hqweye j I ;think I ^^a^-jM^;^^,^)^, apdj-thl^i^th^t^just as in rny last letter L^ Americans of both parties are sincerelyanxio;as toveomertp,an.undopinion,here would welcome some measure, that would&apos; put an end to the&apos; present /chaotic condition if maritime law on account of which&quot; Americans really fear that they may, once again, be drawn, much against their will, into another Fmropeaiiwar..1 1I do not therefore believe it impossible that, provided^W6^r^^e^^&apos;1^4md ^^ jis sufficiently Jeffersonian, the picture itself may be painted in colours not, altogether unpleasing to us.This is more likely to happen when we have to deal with the next Administration than with the present one. Mr. Hoover is nothing if not a &quot; realpolitiker.&quot; He cares more for efficiency than academic idealism. Broderick, to whom I have shown this letter and who knows Mr. Hoover fairly well, considers that he is the man who not only probably will, but also can, persuade leading Senators to agree to a fairly stiff, contraband picture provided they are allowed to supply the Jeffersonian frame.This is, as I have said at the beginning of this letter, all more or less guesswork, but I see no reason to despair of agreement provided always we are willing to accept some compromises and, above all, to give up the food blockade as a part of our policy.Yours very truly,ESME HOWARD.ANNEX.Sir E. Howard to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received January 30.) (No. 67.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, January 29, 1929.&apos;.;   YOUR telegram No. 86. .,        ,By freedom of the seas is meant inviolability of neutral trade on the seas. This has been taught to every American child to be the cardinal part of American policy, and one which America has always been ready to defend. How exactly this should be defined there are few who would be able to.tell us, but I think we may say that the public have a fear of a repetition of what occurred between 1914 and 1917 which then drew America into the war against Germany and might very well have drawn her into war against Great Britain. This is what there is a universal desire in this country to avoid in the future.Reason why, in my despatch No. 61, I excepted professed pacifists was because these desire United  States to enter League of Nations,  in which President Wilson put it, there would be no need to define belligerent or neutral rights because in practice there would be no neutrals.Although there is no definite plan in the mind of the public, it is more than probable that Senator Borah and leading international lawyers, academicians and statesmen have unquestionably in mind a return to the original American thesis as propounded by Jefferson.For Senator Borah&apos;s definition of freedom of the seas (which he summed up asa minimum of belligerent rights and a maximum of neutral rights) see my telegram No. 63 and bottom left column, p. 2250, of &quot; Congressional Record&quot; of the 24th January forwarded in my despatch No. 178.As regards question 2 in your telegram, I think it improbable that incoming Administration, which is pretty likely to be influenced to some extent by its naval advisers, would take so radical a view as that of Senator Borah and those who agree with him. Should this matter, however, come up for serious discussion in the Senate it is more than probable that that body will be so influenced by public opinion that it will insist upon a settlement in accordance with Senator Borah&apos;s views.
