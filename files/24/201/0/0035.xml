(Egg&apos; TOCTOEJTT . IS......THE PROPERTY 02&quot; HIS, BRITATOC MAJESTY^ S. GOBRMJ)5.JJLJLS&quot;CAB I IE T.ARBITRATION    TREASY   WITH   U.S.A.The import of the Belligerent Rights Committee very fairly represents my position on the subject.    But I feel it necessary to develop the views expressed in that report rather more fully*lly reason for being unable to agree with the reecmmenda-tions of the majority of the BeR* Committee is that the advantages to be gained are so small and so problematic and the risks so serious that no Government ought to accept them except in circumstances of great danger which certainly are not at present visible^.By accepting arbitration without reservation of belligerent rights,  it is contended that we may gratify American statesmen to such an extent that they will recall the threatened invitation to a Conference on international maritime law,  or if such conference is held they are likely to agree to conditions which closely resemble our conception of belligerent right soI venture to think that such hopes are illusory. Imring the course of our discussions it has been assumed that UoSoAo would adhere to the policy of their ITaval Prize Manual of 1917, and that the differences between that Manual and our own practice are so small that they could be easily adjusted0 There are several important points which we require and which are not in their Manual.     The most vital are  s-1*    Sight of diversion and detention.2o    Right of search of neutral ships under convoy03.   Examination of mails.4*    Extraneous evidence.So,  /
So, even if we could get their Manual as the authoritative guide, we should lose these valuable methods of warfare. There is also the important question of retaliation,    Moreover, it is not at all clear that IT.S.A. Kaval Policy is now based on that Manual or that they would accept it as the toiniuium and discuss additions to it .    2he last resolution passed by the Senate shows that any discussion is expected to go so far as to consider the inviolability of private propertyoIn addition to these objections, it maat be remembered that any Conference called is not likely to be confined to IToSoAo and Great Britain,,     We shall have to sign Arbitration -treaties with other Uaval Powers,and probably also with countries who have little or no Naval fforce, and it is quite certain that they will clamour for much more drastic restric-tion of belligerent rights, and may be supported to some extent hy U.S.A. in ox*der to reach general agreement, and weaken us.Furthermore,  if we have to take any particular ease to arbitration by a foreign Power, there can be no doubt that their inclination will naturally he hostile to cur view. It has heen contended that at any tribunal the presence of a British and an American judge will ensure that the decision will at least conform to the standard of the UoSoA- Manual. this is a very optimistic view*    In the case of the &quot;Lotus&quot; in 19S6 between the French and the Turks, there were 12 members of the Court.    3?he British, American and Stench judges voted with three others on one side.    On the other side six members voted,  including Brazil,  Cuba and Switzerland, and the casting vote was given against our view by the Swiss President.    Ihis may not have been a very strong case, but at any rate it shows the impotence of ITaval countries before a tribunal so largely composed of land Powers.5?he most that oan be said for the proposal of the Committee is that it may involve us in lesser ovils than would be encountered if some form of reservation is inserted.But /
Bat why should we accept the position of he ing involved in these evils at all?The American practice at present is to throw down some half-considered suggestion for an agreement in a 71 take-it-or-leave-it&quot; manner,  and some    of our advisers here appear to think we must not make any conditions which are not, likely to he accepted in America.,    This is not the attitude of France towards proposals which are distasteful to her,  and I see no reason why it should he ours*    It only leads as a mile to further squeezingaWhat are the dangers foreseen?    One suggested danger is that if we ask for time to consider the effect of unreserved arbitration on belligerent rights, when there is no recognised international code,, the World will raise their hands in holy horror if after the signing of the Kellogg Pact we begin to consider &quot;what might happen if any nations ever were at war in the future .     Such an outcry could hardly be raised by America, who within a few days of ratifying the Kellogg Pact proceeds to pass a bill for .1.5 new cruisers in 3 years   Nor would any such action of ours hp any surprise to other nations * Our spokesmen have consistently taken the view that such reservations are necessaryoIn Septembers 1924, on the Draft Protocol, Mroir^hur fende^soUs referring to &quot;the reservations which the British Government will feel themselves obliged to make&quot; said &quot;95iese reservations relate to disputes arising out of warlike, operations in which the British Empire may in future be invo lve d-! * .lord Grey, in the &quot;Times&quot;, 27th November, 19273  said -&quot;There were two reservations to be made as regarded both the Optional Clause and the All-in Arbitration Treatiesa    One was that they must not refer to  internal affairs - and acts committed when a Nation was at war, especially measures taken on /
on the sea were not suitable for arbitration.     Before the United States came into the war, they took a very narrow view of what might be dons in the way of blockade.   After they came into the war, they joined with the Allies in carrying the rights of blockade and interference with neutral commerce to a point that had never been reached before.    2hus in one war one country had taken very opposite views of what was right and wrong with regard to blockadeo    That meant that on such a matter there was no-agreed lav/ and precedents were valueless, because they could be invoked on every side^ There was therefore no standard by which any tribunal could decide such cases.    Nor could they expect any country that was fighting for its life to hold up for arbitration the act which is considered essential to bring pressure to bear on an enemynoThe Foreign Secretary, on 24th November, 1927,  said, with reference to the Optional &quot;Clause, &quot;At present there is no great body of law on the subject of naval belligerent rightso   We should not know what law would be administered and 1 believe it to. be common ground of all jparties that we should have to reserve that subjectsThus the leading spokesmen of all three parties have expressed views of which the league of Nations is well aware, and so far from there being any astonishment if those views were repeated, the surprise would be if we abandoned themoNor could any just complaint be made if we asked for more time to consult the Dominions when we remember the opinion of New Zealand on the Protocol, published in OcU 2458 and repeated in a Confidential telegram from the Prime minister which was considered at a meeting of the Empire Delegates on September 17th, 1924, in these words: &quot;This Government will not be^ a party^ to,  or authorise you to concur in any form of surrender    of interpretation of British rights in maritime warfare to a Court constituted of a majority of judges from foreign countries&quot;a The
She danger that U.S.A. will build a big Navy may be present in some minds.    Possibly they will build one as large as ours, which would not bs very alarming.    Possibly they might go still further and have a larger Navy than ours, but such a course would fall in time of its own weight, as do most megalomaniac policies^.Their only object is said to be to prevent our interfering with neutrals in time of war, but obviously if we were at war, which is most improbable, we should not be likely to provoke them even with the Fleet they have got now a Therefore all this additional expense would be superfluous. So I am driven to this conclusion^ that of the two risks that of a big American Navy is much less than that of the loss of valuable belligerent rights.If I am asked what alternative I would propose, I would say first of all that as we have got the Eellogg Pact and the Bryan conciliation machinery, there is no need for a new Arbitration Treaty^Or, alternatively, that we must have time   before we answer, owing to the change of Government in U-S^io, and our General Election, and the need of an Imperial Conference *But if it is decided to be necessary to have a   new Arbitration Treaty, I would agree, but reserve  (l) our Monroe Doctrine a3 suggested by the Committee, and (3) belligerent rights either completely or until a code of international law could be agreed and recognised between us, and add that we should be willing to discuss codification.    The BJU Committee have agreed that it is most unlikely that we shall be able to avoid such a conference if an invitation is issuedo    If that is so, it would create a good impression if we forestalled the invitation.,But there is a further aspect of this question, which the Cabinet cannot ignore,  especially on the eve of a GeneralElection  i
Election.    If it were known that we had cast our belligerent rights upon the waters in the hope of recovering them after many days, but without any security that we should, and with very long odds against it, there would be a split in the Conservative Party from top to bottonu    Many important spokesmen in UoSoA. have made the declaration, endorsed now hy Senator Borah himself, that because we would not agree with the reduction they endeavoured to force upon us at the Coolidge conference they would build an enormous Navy and that would compel us to agree to their view of belligerent rightsoIf we now a^ree to all-in arbitration immediately after the UcSoAo Cruiser Bill, we shall make it plain to the World that their threats have not been in vain, and they will proceed to enforce the hardest possible conditions upon us.The very day after the discussions of the B*E* Committee of February 1st, as I was thinking over them I got the following letter from a man I never heard of&quot;Ardshalloch&quot;,59,j Hamilton Drive, pollokshields.3lst -January,  19 9*The J?irst Lord of the Admiralty., WHllSHALLoMy Lord5With reference to the question of freedom of the seas now again brought forward&quot;prominently by the United States, may 1 suggest that in any negotiations the Americans should&apos;be asked to abandon their TIto.ro Doctrine11 if we are to abandon our right to blockade .     he one applies to the land;, the other to the sea0Unfortunately for some reason&apos; Britain seldom bargains about anything.    It is ygive, give, giveT.I am,My   Lord,Your obedient Servant,(Sgdo ) Ds 3?ltzpatrick&quot;o
I believe be represents a very large and most loyal section of our Party, and I am quite certain that if the people who think as he does,  heard of such a proposal, we should have a disastrous agitation like that which took place over the Declaration of London, dividing our Party at the very moment when unity is most needed in our ranksoIf the decision of the majority of the B. R. Committee can be. justified by arguments across the table in secret conclave, it will not be possible to defend it on the platform or in opon debate, because many of the reasons adduced by its supporters would defeat their own ends if they were published, because they depend upon the supposed effect they would Lave upon TJcS*Ao in leading them into the course which we desire and they do not,\7.
