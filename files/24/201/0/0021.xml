Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    ^CP. 21 (29).CABINET.THE PROPOSED IRON AND STEEL ENQUIRY.Memorandum by the Ministry of Labour. (Circulated in accordance with Cabinet 3 (29), Conclusion 9.)1. I AGREE with what I understand to be the view of the Central Office, namely, that to reject the request for an enquiry made by the Iron and Steel Confederation would be politically inexpedient. I say this notwithstanding that it may be objected that the Steel Industry has already been enquired into (a) by the Committee of Civil Research, and(b) by the Balfour Committee,but the C.C.R. enquiry was one which we initiated, and the Balfour Committee have dealt with Steel only as one industry among a number. The suggestion of the Iron and Steel Confederation removes the initiative from us, and if (in accordance with the proposal I think we should make to them) that suggestion is made jointly by both sides of the Industry, we should be fully justified in granting an enquiry. Indeed, I cannot conceive that any Government faced with such a joint request could possibly refuse it.2. While, however, I agree with much of the proposed reply to Mr. Pugh, I venture to suggest that it might with advantage be amended in certain respects. * On the face of it, the proposed reply accepts the suggestion of an enquiry; but terms are used which, in my view, the Confederation will regard as an attempt they would say an unfair attempt to treat their letter as a document which had committed them in favour of safeguarding. I am pretty sure that the reply will be so construed in other quarters, also, and the Confederation would probably be forced to say  &apos; We asked you for an open enquiry without attempting to decide in advance for or against safeguarding; you have offered us an enquiry directed to safeguarding, and we cannot be a party to it.&quot;3. Do we want this result? In other words provided that our line of reply is accepted by the employers do we want a refusal from the Trade Unions, a refusal which means the postponement of any enquiry till after the Election? I suggest that we do not; and I am unable to see in what respect we should lose (but rather do I think we stand to gain) by facilitating a joint request for an open enquiry of the kind indicated in Mr. Pugh&apos;s letter. The enquiry would be subject to the limitation (to which I have reason to know they would assent) that in investigating forms of assistance to the industry the enquiry should be limited to those which might be of immediate help, i.e., nationalization and kindred subjects would be ruled out.4. There is the possible objection that this enquiry, if it is asked for, may delay the operation of Safeguarding. Is this really so? We are pledged not to begin action under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure till after the election. Ultimately, therefore, whether we get &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; to our offer of an enquiry, we do not lose; if the enquiry is accepted, necessary preliminary work will have been started several months before it could otherwise be begun.   If it is not accepted, we* The amendments suggested are shown in the Appendix where ihe proposed reply is reproduced.[18819]
(Draft.)   (Secret.)^ APPENDIX.A. A. Pugh, Esq;,The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, 70, Swinton Street, W.C.1.Dear Sir,I HAVE received your letter of the 31st December with regard to the present position of the Iron and Steel Industry. I need hardly say that I find myself in full sympathy with many of the opinions to which you have given expression. The continued serious unemployment in [condition o/] the Iron and Steel Industry is amatter of concern to the nation as a whole, and it is on that account that I welcome all the more your statement that its affairs ought to be examined rather from the economic standpoint than as a matter of political controversy.In your letter you ask that the Government should consider the setting up of a Royal Commission or other competent committee to make a full and impartial inquiry into the industry. Before I deal with that request I think that I ought to invite your attention to certain relevant facts. Firstly, the Committee on Industry and Trade, now sitting under the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Balfour, has already presented a detailed report on the iron and steel industry, and this report deals at length with some of the matters referred to in your letter; and that Committee will shortly be presenting its final report.Secondly, the Government, by the exemption from stamp duty granted by Section 55 of the Finance Act of 1927, as amended by Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1928, has given a practical encouragement to amalgamations in this and other industries.Thirdly, in framing the Rating Reform Scheme, the Government has paid particular attention to the needs of Iron and Steel, and the reliefs under that Scheme both from the point of view of rates and railway freights are designed and calculated to be of especial benefit to this particular industry.  Lastly, it is the* Letter to &quot; Times&quot; 1st January, 1929.are no worse off and we have lost nothing by offering it. In any eventTit thought that we could &quot; rush &quot;: so important a case&apos; as this? We are not dealing with Buttons or Ribbons but with a basic industry, one whose products enter into almost every other trade, including,agriculture. Will it not be inevitable that the country will demand a full enquiry, and that-whatever Government is in power it will be found necessary to consider at length the implications of any recommendation? Lord Weir,* arguing in favour of the encouragement of new enterprises by the State, made the granting by the Government of a&apos;&quot; complete and sensible&quot; degree of safeguarding for iron and steel &quot; dependent on the comprehensiveness of the reorganisation programme.&quot; &apos; 15. There is the fear that, whereas a Safeguarding Committee could be limited in personnel in the way that other safeguarding enquiries have been limited, an ad hoc enquiry of the kind now proposed might have to take the form of the mixed Committee with which we have been familiar in other connections.I do not think it follows that an ad hoc committee need consist of more than three influential reputable persons whose names are likely to carry weight with the country, with the industry, and with the City. And if the Trade Unions, either on their own initiative or under the influence of the Labour Party, feeling that it has embarrassed them, wish to get out of our offer, they can easily do so by pressing for a big mixed representative Committee, for they will know that if they do there would then be no likelihood of the employers&apos; organizations joining in, and the offer falls to the ground.6. I attach the proposed draft reply, interlined to show the amendments I suggest.A. S.-M- -Ministry of Labour, S.W.1, February 1, 1929.
policy of the Conservative Government, if returned to power, to allow the Iron and Steel Industry to make,, an application under . the Safeguarding of Industries procedure, and thus to have an opportunity then of stating its case before an independent tribunal- In this connection I observe that, in your letter of the 31st December you express the desire that any inquiry should have special reference to the,nature of the competition in the home market. It is in the light of these facts that I must examine the request which you have made to me.An enquiry into the industry such as you suggest, which, if it. were decided upon, would perhaps be conducted more appropriately by a Committee than by a royal Commission, would necessarily [As regards your suggestion of a RoyalCommission, this woidd not in my view be the most effective method of precedure, because inquiry by means of a Royal Commission must inevitably involve delays which might be obviated if a more simple and more expeditious method were adopted, and it is obviously unnecessary that any inqtiiry should traverse again all the ground so recently covered by the Balfour Committee.Regarding the suggestion that other aspects of the problem should be referred to a Committee of Inquiry, it is plain that a Committee of the character suggested by you would necessarily] cover, to a very large extent, the same ground as would be covered by any Committee of Inquiry under the Safeguarding procedure, which might be claimed by the Industry after the General Election in accordance with the declared policy of the Government; and it would clearly be impossible to have two Committees sitting at the same time with overlapping functions.On the other hand, I cannot fail to be impressed by the representations which you, speaking on behalf of all the Trade Unions engaged in this industry, have made to me concerning the avoidance of any unnecessary delay. [As you- know I am precluded from bringing the Iron and Steel Industry within the scope of the Safeguarding Scheme during the lifetime of the present Parliament.&apos;]   If, therefore,[however] both sides engaged in the industry, both the Employers&apos; Organisations and your Confederation, unite in requesting an investigation on behalf of the industry as a whole, I feel that I should be justified in taking exceptional action and I should be prepared to consider&quot; favourably the appointment of an ad hoc Committee, whose function it would be to hold an inquiry into the condition of the industry withspecial reference to the [with special reference to the following points: The&quot;\ state of unemployment in the industry, the efficiency of the industry and its capacity to increase its present output and employ more workers, the nature and volume of the foreign competition with which it is faced, the extent to which that competition comes from countries where wages or other conditions are inferior to our own, and the relation of the industry to other industries in this country [whether the imposition of a duty an foreign imports would be beneficial to the industry, and if so the rate and range of duty suggested and whether the imposition of stich a duty would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment or cost of production in any other industry including agriculture&apos;].[Any industry seeking to oppose a duty on these grounds would of course be entitled, to appear before the Committee (as under the Safeguarding Procedure)..]The appointment of such a Committee would enable an investigation to be made into [be tantamount to an acceleration of the Safeguarding Inquiry to which I have already referred, but a body with such terms of reference would, nevertheless, in my view, be able to direct its attention to] the principal points which have been enumerated by you as deserving of special consideration, and would at the same time be the most expeditious method of achieving the result which you desire.
