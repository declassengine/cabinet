Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1929.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   28G.P. 39 (29).CABINET.I CIRCULATE a Summary of General Groener&apos;s Memorandum in support of the Construction of the new large Cruiser, together with Despatches on this subject from Sir H. Rumbold and Sir W. Erskine.Poland is often represented as a restlessly aggressive Power. It is therefore worth noting how restrained have been Polish comments on this document. This moderation will be estimated at its proper value if it is considered what the reaction of Germany would have been had the situation of the two Powers been reversed.A, C.February 8, 1929.[C 948/517/18] No. 1.Summary of a Translation,published in the &quot; Review of Reviews &quot; for January 1929, of a Confidential German Memorandum, dated November 1928, advocating the Grant of the proposed Credit for the Construction of Armoured Cruiser &quot;A,&quot; and believed to have been written by General Groener, the German Minister of Defence, for Circulation to the Leaders of the Political Parties in the Reichstag.THE writer of the memorandum deals with his subject in the form of four sections, embodying replies to the following questions : I. What are the possibilities that the German defensive forces may be engaged ?II. What will be the tasks of the German navy in each case ? III. Can these tasks be better fulfilled after the replacement of the old ships of the line by new armoured vessels ? IV. Are there other grounds for building these new vessels ?;&apos;; &apos;I. :  , . \ %First, one must rule out all possibility of (a) a &quot; Great War,&quot; in view of the disarmament of Germany under the Treaty of Versailles; and (b) an isolated war against a smaller State, in view of the network of international agreements which would inevitably involve intervention by one or more of the Great Powers. Germany&apos;s forces are not, as some state, sufficient to be a danger even to Great Powers; but, on the other hand, they are not so weak as to be considered a useless expense, better abolished. Their absence would merely be a temptation to foreign Powers which covet German territory, for example Poland, who has her eye upon East Prussia.The possible cases in which the German forces may be required are two : (1) An attempt to seize part of German territory; (2) a conflict between third parties, in which they must protect German neutrality and interests.Case (1).They must protect the frontier against a raid until such time as the League of Nations or a Great Power intervenes in Germany&apos;s favour.   The seizure of Fiume4752   [18831] b
by Italy, of Vilna by Poland, of Memel by&apos;Lithuania, shows that such raids are possible. There is in Poland a hunger for German territory in East Prussia or Upper Silesia; there are indications (military training of civilians, manoeuvres in Pomerelia, &amp;c.) that both &quot; economically and by working on the inhabitants the ,Ppjes are creating a jumping-off place for a raid-.&quot;Case (2).There is no peace in Europe. The recent treaties have left open wounds. There are conflicts of economic interests between Italy and Czechoslovakia, between Yugoslavia and Italy/between Lithuania and Poland with Russia in the background. The antagonism between England and Russia is notorious, and recent disclosures (the reference is, of course, to the alleged Anglo-French Naval Agreement) reveal a grouping of the Powers around England and France on the one hand and the United States of America on the other. In the event of the outbreak of a war Germany would run a risk of being drawn in and must be prepared to defend her neutrality in arms. &quot;And further,&quot; the memorandum proceeds, &quot; if we do not intend that the belligerents should ruthlessly ignore our many-sided economic and cultural interests, which extend beyond our frontiers, we must put ourselves in a position weightily to uphold bur interests.&quot; But Germany must only take part if there are prospects of success. If there are none, no one would think of plunging her into a new chaos; if the prospects are good, the stronger she is the better.II.At the outset of his examination of the tasks of the navy, the writer at once dismisses the possibility of pursuing a &quot;sea-power policy.&quot; But the navy is an indispensable auxiliary to the defensive power of the army; for example, only by sea can military and economic assistance be rendered to East Prussia.Under case(l) of those mentioned above, the greatest danger is that of a Polish incursion into East Prussia. The Polish forces would be superior on land and could prevent direct communication through the Corridor. The navy, therefore, must: (i): Convoy men and munitions (of which East Prussia&apos;s stock is limited by the. Treaty of Versailles); (ii) take part in fighting near the coast; and (iii) protect the land forces from interference by sea.Under case (2) the navy must protect the neutrality of Germany&apos;s territorial waters and ports; or if Germany is forced to join in the war, its tasks will be the same as those in case (1), but on an extended scale. The writer proceeds to envisage the possibility of a war between Poland and Russia or Russia and the Baltic States and quotes from a British publication in support of the view that German sea-power is a necessary counterpoise to Russian sea-power in the Baltic.III.In case (1), the fleet must command the Baltic against Poland. It does so to-day; but Poland (a) has commissioned new destroyers and submarines to be built in foreign yards, and (b) can, under a treaty with France, call upon the latter to support her with a strong cruiser squadron, which can pass under the Polish flag before the outbreak of hostilities without involving France in the war; such a squadron would at the present time give Poland the superiority.i i Since the present German cruisers are inferior to the 10,000-ton cruisers built after the. Washington Naval Agreement, they must be supported by powerful new vessels, possessing the following characteristics:-(a.) A sufficient speed to co-operate with cruisers and avoid engagements with battleships.(&amp;.) Fighting powers superior to that of the 10,000-ton foreign cruisers and sufficient to do fatal damage to battleships at close quarters. (e.) The maximum protection against attack by submarine and aircraft.The proposed new type of armoured cruiser will fulfil these requirements. Nor is it likely that Poland could overcome the superiority of these vessels; the effectiveness of submarines is limited by the shallowness of the Baltic and she is unlikely to be able to build or afford big fighting units. Frances assistance under her treaty with Poland is at present limited to cruisers and small craft because the Mediterranean is her-weak flank;  and, the guarantee of French Mediterranean
communications which, under the Anglo-French Naval Agreement, England appears to have given, is unlikely to endure in view of the strong opposition aroused in England.As regards case (2), the far superior training of the German navy would bo decisive against other Baltic adversaries and, with the better basis for training which the new vessels would afford, would neutralise any advantage Russia might have in ships.IV.The writer finds additional reasons for the construction of the new vessels in :-(a.) The necessity for the training and maintenance of the fighting spirit in the German navy.(b.) The impossibility of modernising and the increasing expense of maintaining the old ships.(c.) The employment already given and to be given by the building of the first vessel and the dislocation which would be caused by the cancellation of the contracts made.No. 2.Sir H. Rumbold to Sir Awsten Chamberlain.(No. 67.)Sir, Berlin, January 25, 1929.THE publication in the &quot;Review of Reviews&quot; for the 15th January of a memorandum alleged to have been circulated to German party leaders by the Minister of Defence for the purpose of convincing them of the desirability of con-structing armoured cruiser &quot; A &quot; has, as was to be expected, been widely reported in the German press. I enclose herein some comments which have been furnished me by Commander Nash, naval attache&quot; to this Embassy, upon the more technical aspects of this disclosure. I have the honour to add my own observations upon the political factors cited by General Groener, and to draw your attention to the con-firmation given by his arguments to the contention so often advanced by this Embassy that German politicians are incurably suspicious, and incurably liable to imagine combinations where no such combinations exist.2. It may be assumed, in the first place, that the memorandum, if not textually accurate, does at least represent the full substance of what General Groener wrote. Its authenticity, in fact, is denied by no one, and was admitted to me by Herr Helferding, Minister of Finance. Moreover, I am not myself inclined to agree with those who suggest that the memorandum was actually designed for publication abroad,, and, in fact, constitutes a subtle act of propaganda against the Polish Corridor. Obviously, the memorandum has been carefully and moderately written, but its moderation is, in my opinion, due not to any desire to impress an eventual foreign audience, but to the need of conciliating the very diverse German audience for whom it was designed.3. Assuming, therefore, that the memorandum is authentic, and was written solely for German consumption, it is necessary to emphasise the extent to which it reveals present German mentality. You have, in the first place, the admission that any great war is at present impossible for Germany, and that the Reich &quot;cannot now nor in the future pursue a sea-power policy.&quot; You have an elaborate central argument on the difference between a Power whose state of defence constitutes either a &quot; risk &quot; or a &quot;temptation&quot; to possible aggressors. You have the secondary argument that a defenceless East Prussia would constitute a &apos;&apos; temptation &apos;&apos; to Poland, fortified by the contention that East Prussia, in view of the Polish Corridor, can only be rescued if Germany possesses naval superiority. And you have the con-clusion that, if Germany is to defend herself against &quot; territorial robbery,&quot; she must be in a position &quot; to guard the frontier until either the League of Nations or a Great Power intervenes&quot; in her favour. This central argument is perfectly avowable, nor could it be questioned by the most convinced German pacifist. It is in his supplementary arguments that General Groener displays political ineptitude. His answer, for instance, to possible objections oh the score of the Franco-Polish alliance is ingenuous, and, if taken together with his other argument regarding the [18831] ^ b 2
regrouping of European Powers, extremely illogical. Under the first heading he contends that France could scarcely reinforce Poland in the Baltic, since British public opinion will not support the naval agreement by which, according to General Groener, we promised to guarantee France in the Mediterranean. Under the second heading he evolves the fantastic theory of a &quot;future grouping of the Powers round England and France on the one hand, and America on the other.&quot; This future grouping, according to General Groener, has been shown up &quot;by the revelations of the last few weeks [he was writing in November] as by a searchlight.&quot; Here, again, we may presume, General Groener means the Anglo-French Naval Compromise, but at this point in his argument the compromise is no longer a pact of such weakness as to prevent France from sending a few cruisers to the Baltic, but an agreement of such strength as to encourage England to adopt a policy of conflict both with America and Russia. The &quot;fighting out&quot; of these antagonisms is, according to General Groener, &quot; only a question of time.&quot; When that time comes Germany must be in the position not merely to safeguard her neutrality, but if she sees &quot; real prospects of success&quot; to join the winning side with profit to herself. The confusion and cynicism of thought implicit in this argument would be obvious to any but the German social-democratic mind.4. General Groener&apos;s memorandum, although foolish, is not necessarily insincere. At the back of his mind the general may have a feeling that these cruisers would be useful in an aggressive war against Poland. I doubt, however, whether he would himself allow such an idea to emerge into the foreground of his conscious-ness. It is far more probable that he, in common with most Germans, apprehends a Polish seizure of East Prussia. It is possible also that he shares the general view of his countrymen that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in their acute anxiety regarding Russia and the United States, have come to some sort of agreement with France. It is conceivable even that General Groener believes that war will one day break out between England and France on the one hand and Russia aided by America on the other, and that in such a war Germany would (and indeed she would) stand in a position of great strategical advantage. Such misbeliefs form part of the mental furniture of many a German brain. What is more difficult to credit is that General Groener, believing such things, should have put them on paper and should have circulated them to a large number of politicians, some of whom at least might be counted on to resent his fallacies and to see that they were exposed. I understand from the Minister of Finance that some thirty-two numbered - copies of the memorandum were actually circulated among members of the Reichstag, and that the Government are instituting strict enquiries as to how the leakage occurred.5. Meanwhile, the German press are on the whole more interested in discussing how the paper came into the hands of Mr. Wickham Steed than in examining the merits of the document itself. The &quot;Tag&quot; attributes the leakage to German Socialists, and remarks that the whole thing is a familiar manoeuvre to prejudice American opinion against Germany on the eve of the reparations discussion. The &quot; Kreuz-Zeitung&quot; sees in the incident the hidden hand of foreign espionage, and clamours for the exposure of the delinquents. This note is echoed in other journals of the Right and Right Centre, and the general agreement is expressed that the memorandum is so moderate and avowable that no harm can be done abroad by its publication. &quot; There is nothing,&quot; says the &quot;Vossische Zeitung,&quot; &quot;in the document which reflects discredit on General Groener, and hardly anything which he did not say in the Reichstag speech when originally defending the construction of this cruiser.&quot; This comment is repeated in the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt,&quot; the &quot;Bbrsen Courier&quot; and the &quot; Lokal-Anzeiger.&quot; The &quot; Germania&quot; apprehends that capital will be made out of the disclosure in English political circles, and the &quot;Berliner Volkszeitung &quot; exclaims that this is what comes of the excessive amiability displayed to: foreigners by the Berlin officials.6. It is possible that this concentration of attention upon the means by which the memorandum reached London is deliberately intended to divert notice from certain awkward implications in the memorandum itself. There is, for instance, curiously little mention of the reaction which General Groener&apos;s statements may produce&apos;in Poland. Interpellations in the Sejm have been reported without comment, and there has been no extended discussion or reproduction of articles in the Polish press. It is evident, however, that a certain uneasiness exists on this score, and the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; voices the general view, when it remarks that &quot;in spite of Polish provocation the vast majority of the German people is perfectly peaceful in its attitude towards Poland.&quot; The &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; goes further. It describes the &quot;agitation&quot; which have arisen in Poland against the Groener
7$ 4!memorandum as &quot;extremely remarkable and uncalled for.&quot;   &quot;We should like,&quot; so . writes the &quot; Vossische Zeitung,&quot; &quot; to see whether the question of a possible attack upon the Danzig Corridor by Germany is contemplated in the memorandum of the Polish General Staff.&quot;  &quot; Not,&quot; adds the paper cautiously, &quot;that we take too seriously ; German fears of a Polish attack upon Eastern Prussia.&quot;7. It is curious that the German papers of the Right and Centre should in this way have begged the question whether the Groener memorandum does or does not make sense. The &quot;Vorwarts&quot; alone tackles this question with any courage. &quot; Groener,&quot; it writes, &quot; employs all the usual illogical arguments and conjures up dangers which do not exist. That is part of his job. But Mr. Steed publishes nothing out of mere sensationalism [many papers incidentally have confused Mr. Wickham Steed with Mr. Stead who perished on the &quot; Titanic &quot; ], and his action must, therefore, be taken as a first move in a campaign against us.....&quot;   The&quot;Vorwarts&quot; proceeds to argue that although the memorandum displays a perfectly peaceful spirit yet General Groener is far too optimistic as to the actual fighting value of his cruisers. &quot;Such a fleet,&quot; concludes this paper, &quot;could never hold the Baltic, and the generals memorandum will gain no new adherents for the cause he advocates.&quot;8.   A copy of this despatch has been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Warsaw.&apos; I have, &amp;c.HORACE RUMBOLD.Enclosure in No. 2. Memorandum by the Naval,Attache, Berlin.(Confidential.)THE naval attache presents his compliments to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin, and has the honour to submit the following observations on the naval arguments advanced in the &quot; Groener Memorandum,&quot; which was published in the &quot; Review of Reviews,&quot; dated the 15th January, 1929.2. It is considered that the exposition under heading II of the tasks the German navy would be called upon to perform in the event of hostilities is based on sound reasoning, provided one is to assume that any hostile forces would have at their disposal the latest type of 10,000-ton cruisers or heavier ships.3. Although at the present time the only naval Power in the Baltic possessing such vessels is the U.S.S.R. (which vessels have no great fighting value), it is only natural that the Minister of Defence should provide for the eventuality that a hostile Power in the future might have such vessels, or might have the assistance of such vessels from another Power.4. With reference to the first of the three tasks of the German navy, which are quoted in the article, viz., &quot; to direct and to convoy essential transport,&quot; it cannot be denied that a German naval force, consisting only of 6,000-ton cruisers and destroyers, would have little chance of safeguarding a convoy in the face of an enemy force having 10,000-ton cruisers at its disposal, whereas if such a German force had the assistance of 10,000-ton armoured ships (superior to the enemy 10,000-ton cruisers), the convoy could be adequately safeguarded.5. As regards the other two tasks mentioned, viz., the protection of land forces against interference by sea, and naval actions near the coast, here again the existence of 10,000-ton armoured ships can only be regarded as essential on the assumption that enemy forces Avould dispose over 10,000-ton cruisers or larger vessels.6. The statement that the present German battleships are incapable of fulfilling the requirements of modern armoured ships cannot well be refuted, as they are all obsolete vessels and highly vulnerable to all forms of attack.7. It is asserted that the new armoured vessels will fulfil the requirements as set forth in the memorandum, but this statement cannot be criticised before full details of the design are known. Such details as have appeared in certain publications indicate that a very high class of vessel is being aimed at, but it remains to be seen whether all the features will be possible of realisation. Great ingenuity Avill certainly be called for from the German naval constructors if all the features claimed by General Groener are successfully to be incorporated in a vessel of&apos; 10,000-tons displacement.
No. 3.Sir W. Erskine to Sir A usten Chamberlain.(No. 43.)Sir, Warsaw, January 24, 1929.THE publication of a confidential memorandum by General Groener by an English newspaper has provided a theme for the press here, but has caused neither surprise nor excitement. It has come at a moment when there are at last some slight signs of progress in the negotiations for a commercial treaty with Germany. M. Zaleski&apos;s recent speech in the Commission for Eoreign Affairs of the Diet (see my despatch No. 29 of the 17th January) was couched in fairly friendly terms so far as Germany was concerned, and, so far as I can judge, from the German press as quoted here, it had a good reception in moderate circles in Germany. A few days later the timber agreement was renewed (see my telegram No. 6 of the 21st January), and the Government press here has begun to adopt a more optimistic attitude about the conclusion of a commercial treaty.2. Given these conditions, I feel myself that the Poles would make a grave mistake in making capital out of General Groener&apos;s memorandum. To do them justice, I do not think that they have. The general tone of the press has been that there is nothing new in what General Groener has put on paper. The German press, it points out, has for a long time past adopted a provocative attitude towards Poland, and has dwelt on her alleged aggressiveness. It could hardly come as a surprise, therefore, that General Groener should exploit this press campaign for his own ends in order to push through his military plans. What Polish opinion could not believe was that the general himself took what he wrote about Poland seriously.3. I took an opportunity of a visit I paid to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State this morning on another matter to refer to the Groener memorandum and to sound him as to the views of the Polish Government on the subject. I said that if he would allow me to express a personal opinion I thought they would make a great mistake if they took it seriously, and that the less said about it the better. I had noticed certain indications pointing to the possibility of the growth of a rather better atmosphere as regards the relations between Poland and Germany, and I thought it would be a great pity if anything were said to cause a setback. Military experts in every country were apt to emphasise all sorts of imaginary dangers in order to obtain sanction for their armaments, and no importance should, in my opinion, be attached to a confidential document which had only been addressed to a very few of the leading politicians with this object.4. I did not know how Mr. Steed had obtained it, but it seemed to me not improbable that it had been communicated to him by someone with pacifist leanings in order to embarrass the Nationalist. If this were so, it seemed a pity, by starting a controversy on the subject, to impede the good effect it might have in this direction.5. M. Wysocki replied that the Polish Government took the view that the memorandum contained nothing new, but merely confirmed what they already knew. Their archives were filled with similar provocative statements by high officials in East Prussia and elsewhere. They had taken no notice of them, and had done their best to keep press criticisms within bounds. They had no intention of making any complaint to M. Rauscher in regard to this fresh instance of Germany&apos;s aggressive intentions or of making much of the matter. They were sincerely anxious to come to terms with Germany in regard to the commercial treaty, and were ready to make very heavy sacrifices to attain this end in the hope that it would lead to a general detente between the two countries. Personally, however, he was not optimistic, believing that concessions from Poland merely led to further demands from Germany. I took the opportunity to call his attention to the advantage of such &amp; detente, which had perhaps not struck him. The Polish Government Were very anxious to interest British financial circles in the development of Polish industries. I believed that one of the main causes of the mistrust towards this country which existed in the City was- 8. In conclusion, unless the German navy is to, renounce heavier, ships than 6,000 tons, it is considered that the arguments put forth in the memorandum for the replacement of the obsolete battleships are logical and reasonable.January 25, 1929.
othe state of tension between Poland and Germany. I thought that nothing would; help so much to remove this mistrust and&quot; to improve Polish credit in London as a real improvement in Polish-German relations.6. In the course of the conversation, which I hope he will repeat to M. Zaleski, he mentioned that the latter had received a telegram from Mr. Steed asking him to contribute a statement on the subject of the Groener memorandum to his paper, and that he thought M. Zaleski would consent.7. Should a suitable opportunity occur I propose to urge the latter to word his statement as moderately as possible.8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin.I have, &amp;c.WILLIAM ERSKINE.
