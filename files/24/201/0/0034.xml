Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1929.secret. .Copy No; 2 8CP. 34 (29).THE CABINET.MILITARY   CONTRIBUTIONS   OF   COLONIAL  AND   OTHERGOVERNMENTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. 1 (Former papers CP. 197 (27), 298 (27), 207 (28).)In 1927 I circulated a memorandum (CP. 197 (27)) containing my proposals for increased military contributions by Colonial and other Governments. That memorandum was considered by the Cabinet at their meeting on 20th July, 1927 (11 (27)), and a committee was set up under Lord Peel to examine and report on my proposals.The recommendations of Lord Peel&apos;s Committee (CP. 298 (27)) were approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 7th December, 1927 (60 (27)) as a basis of negotiation by the Colonial Office, and it was agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should do his utmost to induce the Colonies concerned to adopt the approved proposals.Over a year has since elapsed and I think my colleagues should be aware of the stage which the negotiations have reached. As will be seen from the summary below, the replies so far received from Colonies have been generally unfavourable. The case of the Straits Settlements is special and is under separate discussion between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and myself.(1) Ceylon.The proposal that Ceylon should pay the full cost of her garrison, an increase of roughly  25,000 a year, was conveyed to the colony in January, 1928, but no reply has yet been received.(2) Malta.The proposal that Malta should contribute  37,500 a year of the cost to Army Funds of her local units was communicated to the colony in January, 1928. The Governor replied in February, 1928, that, in view of the present financial position of the island, and of the difficulty that local ministers would encounter in inducing their supporters to vote the suggested contribution, he was of opinion that it was not desirable to raise the question at the present time.   No further action has so far been taken.(3) Bermuda and Jamaica.The proposals provided that these colonies should contribute  12,500 and  25,000 a year respectively. Independently of the Cabinet proposals, Bermuda offered an annual payment of  3,500 from 1st January, 1930, at which date their war contribution of the same amount now paid to the Treasury will cease.This offer has not yet been accepted, and the progress of negotiations with these two Colonies was reported to the Cabinet in a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 207 (28) ).The Cabinet at their meeting on 25th July, 1928 (41 (28)) deferred further consideration of the question of military contributions until the Committee of Imperial Defence had indicated whether it was necessary to retain Imperial garrisons in Jamaica and Bermula.(B29/17)   100   2/29   W.O.P.   4107
The Committee of Imperial Defence have since recommended that the Imperial garrisons at Jamaica and Bermuda should be retained (CP. 352 (28)), and their recommendation was approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 21st November, 1928 (52 (28) )v   No further action has yet been taken as regards the military contributions.(4) Sierra Leone.The West African Regiment has been disbanded, as no arrangement could be arrived at for its maintenance in future from Colonial Votes. The garrison of Sierra Leone will now consist of a small care and maintenance party only for the coast defences, and the proposal that the cost of this party should be borne by Colonial Funds has been accepted.(5) The Channel Islands.The Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. 159-A) recommended that Army Funds should no longer bear any of the cost of the Channel Islands Militia. This recom-mendation was approved by the Cabinet, and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs has informed the Lieutenant-Grovernors that the Home Government has decided that in future no payments in respect of the Militia will be made from Army Votes.(6) Sudan.Although a contribution in respect of the Sudan garrisorj was not dealt with by Lord Peel&apos;s Committee, in view of the previous Cabinet decision of 13th July, 1927 (40 (27) ), 1 think I should mention here that the Sudan Government has hot yet accepted that decision, which was that the extra cost of the Sudan garrison ( 70,000) should be defrayed by a rion-interest bearing loan to the Sudan Government from the Home Government, such loan to be repaid when the Sudan Government was in the position to do so.L. W.-E.The War Ofeice,11*A February, 1929.
