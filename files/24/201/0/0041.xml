909 ci 0 printed for the Cabinet.   February 1929.CABINET.REDUCTION IN BRITISH FORCES IN CHINA.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. IN his Memorandum of the 19th November, 1928 (CP. 353 (28)), the Secretary of State for War expressed the view that the recent situation in China showed so much improvement that it was now possible safely to effect a further reduction of our forces in that country by the withdrawal of two further battalions at the end of the current trooping season, bringing the total number of battalions in China down from 8 to 6. He proposed that one Battalion, which had just left England to relieve another at Shanghai, should be stopped at Malta, and that the second, which was in India under orders to proceed to China at an early date, should be brought direct from India to Gibraltar and stationed there.2. The Cabinet thereupon agreed on the 21st November (Cabinet 52 (28), Conclusion 8) (a.) That the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the British Minister at Peking that one Battalion destined for China had been stopped at Malta and would not be sent on to China, and that, subject to his agreement, the second Battalion would not be replaced; so that our forces in that country would be reduced to 6 Battalions.(5.) Subject to Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s concurrence, to approve a reduction of our forces in China to 6 Battalions.(c.) To approve the action of the Secretary of State for War in stopping one Battalion at Malta owing to the considerable economy thereby effected.3. On the 26th November Sir Miles Lampson telegraphed to the Foreign Office stating that both the Commander-in-Chief and the General Officer Commanding advised that strength should remain for the present at 8 battalions, which might be reduced to a minimum of 7 at the end of the trooping season, provided that the situation remained quiet throughout the winter, but no further; and that he (the Minister) was clear that this was the right course. The despatch of the 14th November, of which this telegram was a summary, has now been received and circulated (No. 1391 of the 31st December, 1928).* -----1-4. It is understood that, notwithstanding the views of the authorities on the spot, one battalion did actually leave China on the 23rd December, so that the number there has now been reduced to 7.5. Before acquiescing in the opinion of Sir Miles Lampson that no further reduction should be made, 1 think that the Cabinet should have the considered views of the Army Council and of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the present situation. I observe that the Secretary of State for War was aware, when he put forward his memorandum of the 21st November, that the General Officer Commanding, North China Command, was opposed to a reduction of our forces below 7 battalions, but that he did not accept that opinion, emphasising the[18866]
importance of making the Shanghai Settlement realise that they must make adequate arrangements for their own protection.      ... 7-6r^Hrrumrnofc aware that there has been anyworsening of the situatiomsince that time, and, in view of the burden which Shanghai is still imposing on the British ExchequM, ^^hink that we should know whether there is sufficient reason-ifj)B. altering the proposals originally made by the Secretary of State for War.      --1W.
