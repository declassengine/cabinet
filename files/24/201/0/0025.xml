MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.In continuation of my Memorandum of the 10th January, OP. 1 (29), I circulate certain further telegraphic correspondence with the Viceroy which elucidates certain points in his long telegram of the 18th December, which appeared to me not entirely clear, in regard to the composition and scope of the suggested Tribunal.I hope shortly to put before my colleagues proposals which I hope will lead to a solution of the present impasse.PEEL4th February 1929.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 10th January 1929,120. Private and personal. Thank you for your private and personal telegram dated 18th December, Capitation Rate, which I am about to circulate to Cabinet. I am not quite clear what you mean by statement in last paragraph that Tribunal ought to be associated with Commission^ enquiries. Is it intended that Tribunal should not make award, but record opinion which would be considered by Commission, who would include a recommendation in their Report ? Will you please elucidate further? What would be your ideas as to composition of Tribunal and terms of reference ?From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 19th January 1929.230.. Private and personal. My private.te and personal telegram, 10th January, 120. Capitation Rate. I should be grateful for early reply in order to be able to pursue question in early meeting of Cabinet.In your reply would you kindly confirm or correct my assumption that words &quot;this particular question&quot; in para. 19 of your private and personal telegram of 18th December are intended to refer to whole area of capitation discussions, including claim by India for contribution from Imperial revenues to general military charges in India. It was in this form that I recently told Cabinet that I should desire that -any reference of the Government of India&apos;s claim to an independent tribunal should be stated.From Viceroy, 19th January 1929.31 S. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 10th January, No. 120. Capitation Rate. In using the words &quot;associated with &quot; I had in mind that Simon would have to deal with principles affecting relations between the British and Indian Governments, and that award of the independent tribunal which I proposed for the Capitation Rate could hardly be made in vacuo and without reference to such principles. For example, it was an essential part of my argument that the relationship between the two Governments ought not to be regarded as strictly commercial (see para. 3 of my telegram of 18th December). If the capitation rate tribunal had to consider what other elements should be imported into the relationship, they would be forced to express views on matters which must almost inevitably be covered by Simon&apos;s Report. If conflicting views were expressed, it would obviously create a most embarrassing situation. For these reasons, my own opinion is that the capitation rate enquiry could best be undertaken as part of a general enquiry into the financial relations between the two Governments, as a sequel to, or as a subsidiary part of, Simon&apos;s own enquiry.2. It was only because I thought Cabinet might regard this as involving excessive delay that I expressed willingness to try and get ray Council to consider, as an alternative, the immediate institution of a special tribunal. I do not like this alternative, and it is only defensible if steps are taken to ensure that the tribunal does not express views on matters of principle, which might conflict with those stated in Simon&apos;s Report. It is for this reason that I said it must be associated with Simon&apos;s enquiry. I should like, with your approval, to discuss the whole question with Simon, after which I might be able to make more precise proposals. 3412      75   2.29Printed for the Cabinet,   February 1929,SECRET.CP. 25 (29).The Indian Contribution to Home Effective Charges of theBritish Army.
3. As regards the constitution of tribunal, it is essential that this should be such as to command public confidence in its complete independence and impartiality. As an illustration of my own idea, I suggest some such constitution as thatfef a judge from one of the Dominions as President, and two members, say, some public man in England like Ullswater and a non-ofhcial Indian such as Sastri.As regards the terms of reference, probably the published terms would best be kept very wide, as was done with the Wei by Commission. But the points to be considered are those indicated in paras. 3 and 4 of my telegram of 18th December, and might be raised by the following questions. (Please note that the wording used in the next paragraph is not put forward as suitable for inclusion in the published terms of reference. I set out these questions only in order to indicate the points which the Government of India would wish to raise. As stated above, I think that the published terms should be kept wide and general, but from our point of view they must be framed widely enough to cover the points which I now set out.)(i) On the assumption that India is responsible for her own defence and liable to refund to the British Government the whole cost of providing British troops for service in India, how can that cost be properly calculated, i.e., over and above the actual cost of maintaining the troops during their service in India, what share of the cost of the preliminary training and pension charges is fair, proportionately to India&apos;s share in the total value of the so!dier&apos;s service?(ii) Having regard first to the political relations between India and the UnitedKingdom ; secondly, to the vital responsibility of the United Kingdom for the defence of the Empire as a whole ; and, thirdly, to the importance of the defence of India in any general plan of Imperial defence, what, if any, contribution is it equitable that the British Government should make to the general cost of maintenance of the fighting forces in India, both British and Indian?(iii) In  answering the preceding question, the following subsidiary questionsmust be considered : (a) the extent to which the fact that the defence of India is an essential part of the task of Imperial defence makes the former a more serious obligation ;(6) the value of the Army in India in general scheme of Imperial defence as a quickly mobiliseable reserve which may be available for service in other theatres ;(c) the extent to which need for maintaining Army in India on a basis of organisation and equipment which would fit it to co-operate with other Imperial units, puts the Government of India under au obligation to adopt a more costly standard in these matters than would be necessary if the only problem to be considered were local defence of India ;(d) the value to British Army of opportunity for service in India as an element in increasing its general efficiency ;(e) the extent of the services rendered by India to the United Kingdom, e.g. in educating the children of British soldiers who return to the United Kingdom, and in giving specialised training in various military institutions in India to officers and men who serve in India for only a short time.- - Consideration of above questions clearly elucidates the connection between this enquiry and general enquiry being conducted by the Statutory Commission. You will observe that in my view narrower question of capitation rate ought to be merged into the larger question of Indian military expenditure generally as suggested by Lord Birkenhead in his private telegram of 13th June 1928.From Viceroy, 21st January 1929. 35 S. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 19th January. Capitation Pate. My private and personal telegram No. 31 S. of the 19th January has crossed your telegram and gives you the information you require. You will see from the proposed terms of reference in para. 3 of my telegram that the words &quot;this particular question,&quot; to which you refer, comprised, as you have assumed, the whole area of capitation discussions, including claim by India for contribution from Imperial revenues to general military charges in India.
