CONFIDENTIAL. ,    &apos;COPY NO.      &apos;CP. 42  (29).CABINET.THE  IRON AND STEEL  INDUSTRY, PROPOSED ENQUIRY 3Y A ROYAL COMMISSION OR OTHER BODY.Copy of reply by the Prime Minister to the letter from the General Secretary to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation,&quot;&quot;- (See CP&quot;. 20*7291).(Circulated for purposes of record by directi6n of the Prime Minister, with reference to Cabinet 5  (29) ?  Conclusion if) .10, Downing Street, S.&apos;7.1 .8th February,  1 929 .Dear Sir,I have received your letter of the 31st December with regard to the present position of the Iron and Steel Industry. I need hardly say that I find myself m full sympathy with many of the opinions to which you have given expression.      The con-dition of the Iron and Steel Industry is a matter of concern to the nation as a whole,  and it is on that account that I welcome all the more your statement that its affairs ought to be examined rather from the economic standpoint,  than as a matter of political controversy.In your letter you ask that the Government should consider the setting up of a Royal Commission or other competent committee to make a full and impartial enquiry into the industry. The wisdom of setting up a Royal Commission,  a slow process at best, must depend on whether such a lengthy enquiry is needed to supply information not otherwise available or is a necessary preliminary to effective action.      In my view a course inevit-
OOPably involving ouch, delay is unnecessary orL-ex.trier ground; and I would invite your attention to the following facts.Firstly,  the Committee on Industry and Trade, now sitting under  the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Balfour, has already presented a detailed report on the iron and steel industry and this report deals at length with some of the matters referred to in your letterJ    and that Committee has no&quot;&apos; completed its final report, which I hope to receive shortly.      It is obviously unnecessary that any enquiry should, traverse again the ground so recently covered by the Balfour Committee.Secondly,  the Government &quot;by the exemption from stamp duty granted by the Finance Acts of 1927 and 1 928 has given a practical encouragement to amalgamations in this and other industries.Thirdly,  in framing the Rating Reform Scheme,  the Government has paid particular attention to the needs of Irin and Steel, and the reliefs under that Scheme - both from the point of view cf rates and railway freights - are designed and calculated to be of especial benefit to this particular indus try.Lastly,  it is the policy of the Conservative Government,  if returned to power,  to &quot;allow the Iron and Steel Industry to make an application under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure, and it will then have an opportunity of stating its case before an independent tribunal.      In this connection I observe that in your letter ?f the Jlst December you express  the desire that any enquiry should have special reference to the nature of the competition in the home market.It is plain that a Safeguarding enquiry must necessarily deal with this particular question and with certain other aspects or the problem to which you refer; and it would clearly he impossible to have two committees sitting at the same time with overlapping functions.
i o arj 0 0In these circumstances, in view of the ground covered by the Balfour Committee,  the far-reaching action which the Government has taken, and the opportunity which the industry will have of presenting its case under the Safeguarding procedure,  if I am again returned to office, I am bound to say that I think a long roving enquiry is unnecessary;    and would not be helpful to the industry.Yours truly,(Signed)    STANLEY BALDWIN.A0 Pugh Esq., The Iron  -. Steel Trades Confederation.
