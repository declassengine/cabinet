SECRET.APPRECIATION  OP THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No.  72.PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Peace Discussions (page 15).Special attention is drawn to the German undertaking not to use the Russian ships handed over to them until a general peace is concluded. According to all precedents this affords a direct indication of their intention to use them. The doctrines of Clausewitx (I) that words, &quot;which are very inexpressive, are chiefly- the means with which the wily one takes in those he practises upon,&quot; and (2) that &quot;strategy knows no other activity than the regulating of the combat with the measures which relate to it; it has no concern, like ordinary life, with transactions which consist merely of words,&quot; have both been followed consistently by the Germans in this war. The Board of Admiralty (G.T. 4788) have recently presented their view of the situation.Geneual (see page 2).Socialist movements are prominent in Enemy, Neutral, and Allied countries. (See under France, Hah/, Austria-Hungary, and Denmark.) Reports are of interest in connection with the proposed Conference in England on June 26th.Details are given of the progress of negotiations at The Hague about British and German war prisoners.The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs have denied the German allegations about the misuse of hospital ships by ourselves and our Allies.The question of Czecho-Slovaks in Bussia is dealt with.Allied Countiu ks.Belgium (see page 3). An explanation is given of the German failure to destroy Belgian national sentiment by driving a wedge between the Flemish and the Walloons.-  China (see page 4). The Germans hope to turn the Sino-Japanese agreement to their advantage.France (see page 4). There are indications of a rift between Socialist parties. Italy (see page 5). There are similar indications.Enemy Countries.Austria-Hungary (see. page 6). Socialists oppose German absorption and all that it, stands for. [p.t.o.
Germany (see page 7). German propagandists are active in Belgium, Franc, Mexico, Sweden. The Germans protest against the publication by wireless of com-nltmications between the Bolshevists and M. Joffe. Such publication iu their opinion amounts to propaganda.Special attention is called to the great importance of the German hid for neutral shipping after the war.NEUTKAL Co TIN X UIE S.Finland (see page 9). Appears now to be pro-German, and the army under German control.   The attitude of the &quot;Swedish party &quot; gives us some encouragement.Netherlands (see page 11). The important question of the right of search of neutral ships by belligerents has been raised with Great Britain. The German corresponding policy is to &quot; sink without trace &quot; when to their advantage to do so.Spain (see page 12). The Government appears to be in difficulties.Switzerland (see page 13), Great Britain is giving additional help with coal supplies. The question has been raised of using for Swiss supplies the German merchant ships interned in Spain.Vatican (see page 14), The British abstention from bombardment of Cologne on Corpus Christ! Bay appears to have added moral strength to our cause. The German defence of their bombardment of Paris ou that clay is that the French ought to have commemorated Corpus Christ! on some other day ! They go back to the year 1802 for their authority. It is needless to add that the Archbishop of Cologne made no mention of this idea when he issued his appeal for iminuuitv.G. G. A.June 13th, 1918.

PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.general.Sinkings. According to the War &quot;Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing-ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period May 3&apos;lst-June 6th inclusive, was 73,309 tons gross, of which 31,461 were British, as compared with 52,610 tons gross, of which 42,931 were British, reported last week.Merchant Vessel Construction. The number and gross tonnage of merchant steamships of 100 tons and upwards reported completed in: the&quot; United Kingdom during 1918 are as follows :  . .Month. No. of Vessels.      Gross Tonnage.21 58,56833 100,03845 . 161,67437 111,53349 197,274Total - -     185 629,087The gross tonnage of merchant steamships completed during these five months represents an increase of 63 per cent, on the output during the corresponding months of 1917, when the gross tonnage completed was 385,723 tons.Work of the Admiralty Controller. A Memorandum (G.T. 4790) dated June Sth records the work done by the Admiralty Controller^ Department under Sir Alan Anderson, K.B.E.British Delegation ta The Hague for Negotiations regarding Prisoners : Sinking of &quot; Koningin Regentes.&quot; It was announced that the British Delegates to The Hague (see Report No. 71) would sail in the Dutch Hospital Ship Kdningin Regentes. In fact, they sailed in the Sindoro. Mr.- Maxse reports that the former ship was sunk at 1.15 p.m, on June 6th, 20 miles east of Leman Bank Lightship. It is stated that seven lives were lost. German Wireless of June 8th, 9th, and 10th iterates that the disaster was caused by a mine, and intimates that it must have been an English mine. The Dutch Press reports that the German Minister has conveyed to the Netherlands Government and the Zeeland Company the condolence oi the German Government. The Nieuiue Rotterdamsche Courant says that the evidence of various passengers agrees in showing that the ship was torpedoed : &quot; There seems to be no possible doubt on the subject.&quot; The Nieuwe Courant says, &quot; Statements of various witnesses on board the Koningin Regentes compel us to.accept unreservedly what yesterday we considered unbelievable.&quot; German Wireless of June 9th. and 10th denies the accusation, and the Deutscher Nachrlchten Dienst in a communique to the Dutch Press also denies it, declaring that submarine commanders have received orders not to interfere with hospital ships for exchange of prisoners. Handelsblad states that a detailed enquiry will be held at Middle-burg by a special technical Commission. The first meeting of the Delegates was held on June Sth. After speeches by the Netherlands Foreign Minister, Sir G. Cave and General Friedrich, the programme proposed by the British Delegates was accepted. At the second meeting, held on June 10th, the British Delegates brought-forward their complaints, regarding the continued employment of British prisoners within 30 kilometres of the firing line, and the harsh treatment of such prisoners in occupied territory.Hospital Ships. A Madrid message of June 1st states :-&quot; German newspapers having asserted that British and French hospital ships were being used for the january February March April May -
transport of munitions of war, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued an official Note, declaring that an inquiry made by the Spanish Government enables it to affirm that the British, French and Italian vessels sailing as hospital ships, and on board which are Spanish delegates, are being employed in a perfectly correct manner, and -exclusively for the transport of wounded and sick.&quot;Serbian Prisoners in Bulgaria. The Serbian Government will shortly invite the assistance of the Allied Governments in requesting certain concessions from the Bulgarian Government in favour of Serbian prisoners of war and civilians. His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to extend its strongest support.Italo-Gcrman Prisoners Agreement. The Foreign Office is informed that the main points of the Italo-German Prisoners Agreement (see Reports Nos. 70 and 71) deal with : (1) Repatriation of prisoners unfit for any military duty either permanently or for at least a year ; specifications of injuries qualifying for repatriation and methods of selection ; (2) repatriation, of sanitary staff in deference to the Geneva Convention ; (3) treatment of prisoners, especially in regard to exchange of lists, correspondence, employment in canteens, exercise, intellectual occupation, punishments, visits from neutral missions, institution of relief committees selected by prisoners, distribution of parcels, appointment of neutral delegates to look after welfare of prisoners and distribution of gifts ; (4) repatriation of fit prisoners over 45 years, or over 40 and having three children. The total number agreed upon for exchange is four officers and 1.20 men. Tf this number cannot immediately be completed from the above categories it is to be made good by adding (a) prisoners of more than 18 months&apos; standing ; (?) men over 40 having less than three children; (c) other prisoners over 40 and (cl) prisoners under 40 having families.Far East. The Foreign Office learns that serious conflicts have broken out all along the Siberian Railway between the Bolshevists and the Czecho-Slovak troops. The Bolshevist Government declares the latter to be mutineers in league with &quot;Russian counter-revolutionaries, and the agents of foreign imperialism&quot; (see Russian Wireless of June 11th). According to a Russian Wireless message of June 9th, they have assisted to re-establish a bourgeois Municipal Duma at Tcheliabin.sk : &quot; Czecho-Slovaks with. the Cossacks and the black bands are parading the streets. It is reported from Ekaterinburg that wherever the Czecho-Slovaks are in power they replace the Soviets by groups of local usurers and White Guards.&quot; Count Mirbach has demanded that the Czecho-Slovaks shall not be allowed to leave the country for the Western Front. Joffe has stated his belief &quot; that even without the request of the German Government the Czecho-Slovak troops can get out of Russia only alter having beaten Russian detachments.&quot; There is a disposition, however, on the part of the leaders of both sides, supported by French or American mediation, to come to an understanding. The hostility of the Czecho-Slovaks is primarily directed, against the enemy prisoners, who are fighting them in the guise of Bolshevists, and also conducting a newspaper campaign against them, and fanning Bolshevist hostility. It is reported that there are about 275,000 enemy prisoners in Siberia, of whom a considerable number are armed. Of the 6,000 troops opposing Semenoff (who has been compelled to fall back), more than half are enemy prisoners. Political parties in Vladivostock have united in the face of the expected Bolshevist advance. Sir C. Greene reports that the Japanese Government, while agreeing as to the necessity of keeping war material at Vladivostock under Allied control, maintains its view that the employment of force for this purpose cannot properly be considered, apart from the question of intervention (see Report No. 65).ALLIED GROUP.BELGIUM.Flemish Movement-In the New Europe of June 6th, at page 1.78, M. Emile Cammaerts discusses the German efforts to stimulate Flemish activism, and observes that German intrigue has &quot; utterly failed to stir up any separatist movement in Belgium, or to enlist the support of any prominent personality or association belonging to the Flemish movement before the war, and that an impassable gulf exists between
tlie whole of the Belgian people and the , small hand of &quot;Activists,&apos; who are con-sidered as the paid agents of the enemy. In fact, instead of growing more influential, the Activist leaders become more and more discredited, despised and hated for having received the enemy&apos;s help in their vain attempts to divide the nation. The recognition by the Germans, far from giving more importance to .the&quot; Council of Flanders,&quot; definitely wrecked the small shadow of influence which it might have had among the real extremist Flamingants. Its members are now outside the pale of society, and have identified themselves with the Germans. (See also Reports Nos. 62, 54, 59, 65, and 70.)CHINA.Enemy Aliens. In view of a general appeal from the International Red Cross, discussion between the Allies regarding German threats of retaliation, and more immediate claims upon the tonnage allocated, arrangements for the deportation of enemy aliens from China to Australia have been temporarily suspended (-see Reports Nos. 57, 58, 61, 63-65, 69-71).Reported Japanese Loan Negotiations. Sir J. Jordan reports persistent rumours that negotiations for a Japanese loan to China (see Reports Nos. 70 and 71) are being carried on privately. - He points out that British and American interests would be affected by the conclusion of any such agreement based on a tobacco monopoly. It would seem that any money advanced is. likely to be dissipated in aimless hostilities between North and South (and see the Times of June 7th).German Propaganda and the Sino-Japanese Agreement. The leading German papers of May 29th attach great importance to the Japanese-Chinese agreement. The Kblnische V olkszeitung writes  &quot;We expect joint Japanese-Chinese action in the Far East to the detriment of the Entente.&quot; Germania thinks the agreement the beginning of the exclusion of the United States from the Chinese market and the undermining of American political influence in the Far East. The Kreuzzeitnng says : &quot; Japan is following a purely Japanese policy. England is already eliminated as an economic factor in the Far East.&quot; The Kblnische Zeitung writes : &quot;The private reports from Copenhagen indicate that European trade in the Far East has entirely ceased, and that only Japanese and American goods are being sold. Japan intends stationing her troops all over China to preserve quiet.&quot; (See also Reports Nos. 69 and 71.)CUBA.War Legislation. Mr. Leech reports that the President of the Cuban Republic is anxious to expedite the adoption of measures against enemy trading and espionage. It is to be hoped that the Liberal party, which is showing some diffidence, may be persuaded to siipport these measures before the adjournment of Congress at the end of June.(See also under &quot; Mexico.&quot;) iFRANCE.French. Socialist Wings. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4753) dated May 30th, the Political Intelligence Department traces the divergence of the French Socialist Right and Left Wings under MM. Varenne and Longuet respectively, and their influence upon the Centre under Thomas and Renaudel. As the result of a vigorous letter from Mr. Bran ting, denouncing the German Socialists, and of the strong attitude taken up by the American Labour Delegates, 40 of the 100 Socialist Deputies came out into the open as favouring the exclusion of the German Socialists from the International (see Report No. 68). The Americans and Varenne believe that &quot; peace is worthless unless it be the peace of security and of justice, and that talk about it is dangerous unless it is clearly understood that it is that peace and. that only which can be discussed. Longuet wants to begin talking about peace at once, and he does not wish to make any difficulty about conditions.&quot; The truth is, that all over the world the same parting of the ways is going on in the Socialist and Labour Parties.....   &quot;Don&apos;t talk so much about the war,&quot; called out Longuet to one of
the Americans; &quot;tell ns about the Social movement in the United States.&quot; d&apos;o which the speaker, Mr. Berry, replied : &quot; In the face of the enemy there is no social movement in my country ; there is only a national movement.&quot; That is the vital distinction. One set of men think in terms of the International .... the other set are primarily Frenchmen or Englishmen defending their own countries ; and when they get outside the national issue, their feelings are not so much those of workmen or Socialists as those of men defending the cause of humanity against a conspiracy of crime. &quot; Varenne will best serve his cause by remaining in. the party, if he leaves it the Centre will drift in the direction of the indefatigable and almost fanatical minority . . . .&quot; &quot; ddie gravity of the military situation will no doubt prevent for the moment any acute development of the Socialist divisions. But it is difficult not to think that, however regrettable in the national interest, it will come before very long .... Meanwhile, the principal, visible and immediate result of Varenne&apos;s action is a further strengthening of the parliamentary position of ClemenceauGerman Propaganda. German Wireless of June 5th and 7th cpiotes &quot; the Rumanian Government newspaper Steagxd, the organ of the Minister President Marghilomans &quot; as declaring that &quot;the Americanisation of Europe is the real object of American policy ; and this Americanisation has already commenced in France. In France, a beginning has already been, made, and the Americans, in the most shameless way, have already established themselves in the management of French industry and French means of communication. French workmen are being sent to the front and replaced by Americans. . . . The declaration of the Cri de Paris to the effect that France herself, even if she had the opportunity, can conclude no separate peace, is a proof of how seriously people in France feel her bondage.&quot; German . Wireless of June 9th attempts to make propaganda out of the emplojunent in France of American doctors.   (See also Report No. 69.)ITALY.Signor Orlando and the Allies. Italian AYireless of June 6th quotes the following declaration made by Signor Orlando to the Temps :  &quot; We will not give way in, the dark days nor commit injustice in prosperity. Not only can nothing separate us from the Allies, but we shall continue wdth a firm spirit to work for victory.&quot;Financial Situation. Italian Wireless of June 6th reports: &quot; Italy&apos;s financial situation is excellent, even though the Italian ddeasury has not received provisions from the provinces of Belluno, ddeviso, Udine. Venice and Vicenza. The total receipts from Income Tax for .1917-18 amount to lire 339,000,000, that is 20,000,000 more than estimated. The super-profit tax on war industries wdll yield 442,000,000, or 92,000,000 more than estimated. The Real Land J^ax, owing to non-returns from the invaded pr-cvhices, will be decreased by only lire 300,000. The Land Tax will give an increase of 4,000,000. Signor Meda; the Minister for Finance, says that the total entries wdll be about 4,000,000,000, with an increase of 2,000,000,000 on pre-war entries, ddie Governments policy is to prevent the cost of the war from weighing upon the poorer classes.&quot;Labour Union. Italian Wireless of June 11th announces that the first National Labour Congress, organised by the Italian Syndicalist Union at Milan, has approved the formation of an Italian Labour Union, ddiis is a new organisation which does not deny the claims of patriotism, and wishes to unite labour in a purely Syndicalist association, independently of political parties. Its fundamental idea is the collabo-ration of all classes for increased production and the maintenance of a firm national, defence policy. The Italian Labour Union is being created in opposition to the General Labour Confederation, which is under the domination of the neutralist Official Socialists, ddie workmen of Lombardy, Liguria, Emilia, Romagna, the province of Rome and Naples have adhered to the new organisation, which thus numbers 120,000 members.Bolshevist Campaign. The Foreign Office has received further information of Bolshevist designs to stir up revolution in Italy.   (See Report No. 69.)JAPAN.German Weltpolitik and Anglo-Japanese Go-operation. The Times of June 13th at page 8 reports speeches made by Mr. Balfour and the Japanese Ambassador
emphasising Anglo-Japanese solidarity in the face of German &quot;political-economic penetration.&quot; 1PANAMA.Death of tlie President. The President of the Republic, Dr. Valclez, has died. Dr. Urriola, the President-Designate, has assumed&apos;office.   The late President was strongly pro-Entente in his sympathies, and when the United States declared war he. at once issued a proclamation pledging the Government unreservedly to assist the&apos; United States in the defence of the Canal,   lie was formerly Minister in London.PORTUGAL.Goods ex Enemy Vessels. Sir L Carnegie reports arrangements by the Portuguese Government, according to which, of goods ex enemy vessels, some will be requisitioned by the Government, others released conditionally upon sale in Portugal, and the rest re-exported. Provision is made for compensation of real owners of goods requisitioned.UNITED STATES.Address by Mr. Lansing. Mr. Lansing, Secretary of State, has delivered a notable address at Schenectady on Prussianism and American peace aims (see the Times of June 13th at page 5).ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Vica-Chancellor con Payer and the Austro-German Pact. German Wireless of June 10th reports a long interview given by Vice-Chancellor von Pay^er to the Berlin correspondent of the Neue Freie Presse on the subject of Austro-German negotiations. In the course of his remarks he said : &quot; The limits between countries must gradually disappear, and hand in hand we must proceed with the unification of their economic laws, while maintaining the political independence of both Empires.&quot; .... &quot; If the Northern border States would afford military adherence to Germany, if Poland were in alliance with the Central Powers .... and the Balkan States liberated from the pressure of Russia, the peace of Europe would then lie in the hands of Germany and Austria-Hungary united. . . . The more numerous are the peoples in arms at the disposal of the Allied Powers, the less will be the armament burden for those individual peoples as for the whole.&quot;Hungarian Government and the Austro-German Pact.- According to a Press rerjort Count Tisza and Dr. Wekerle, speaking on June 5th in the Hungarian Lower House, observed that the deepening of the Alliance must not alter the Dual Monarchy&apos;s interests, and could only be carried out along the customary international lines. The agricultural interests of Hungary must he specially protected.Austro-Tlungarian Socialists and the Austro-German Pact. According to iufor-mation received by the Foreign Office the Parliamentary representatives of the Austrian Socialist Party have announced to Count Burian their intention of opposing by all possible .means the projected Treaties with Germany, unless the Russian, Ukrainian, and Rumanian peace treaties be cancelled. Buriau is reported as replying that Austria-Hungary would not negotiate further with Germany unless the latter would consent to an Austrian solution of the Bolish question ; so far such consent had been - given conditionally by Bavaria and Saxony only. (It is stated that Bavaria&apos;s support is conditional upon Austrian financial assistance in the furtherance of Bavarian canal schemes.) Cancellation of the treaties above mentioned is also demanded by the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Party of Radical Citizens, who intend to co-operate with Count Michel Karolyi on the basis of Hungarian indepen-deuce and complete separation from Austria,General Attitude of Socialists-.  The Vienna correspondent of the Berliner Tageblatt says : &quot; While the Government has the greatest difficulty in restraining the outburst of national passions in north and south, the Imperial Conference of
German Social-Democratic Workers of Austria deliberated for two days on the situation and the feeling among the working classes. Idle result of the deliberation is contained in an appeal to German workers in Austria which has now been issued.The conference,&apos; the appeal says, &apos; confirms the view that the workers are in a state of the greatest excitement, and it warns the Government against the effects which would, inevitably be produced by the excited feeling of the masses unless the workers are convinced that the Central Powers would not prolong the war for any imperialistic aims, unless&apos; everything were done to collect and equally to distribute foodstuffs, unless the Government forthwith summons Parliament and takes all steps in accordance with its solemn promise to settle labour conditions in the war industries on the basis of civil law, and unless the Government meets the social and political -demands of the workers. The conference exhorts the workers not to strike now, but to hold themselves ready for a more favourable hour which will come. It warns the workers against over-estimating their strength and committing imprudent acts which -can only lead to defeats, and finally urges the workers to keep up their determination and fighting spirit.&quot; &apos;   .[The Daily Review points out that in the versions sent out by the Vienna Korrespondenz Bureau on June 4th and German AVireless of June 6th, the appeal is made to take the form of a warning against strikes, and that passage is omitted which refers to the &quot; more favourable time which will come.&quot;]germany.General Conditions. The Foreign Office is informed that German officers of the expeditionary force to Finland have, in conversation, laid greater stress upon the present hardships of the German population than upon the successes of the Army in the AVest. A report received refers to the almost complete lack in Berlin of leather footwear, upper and underwear, shirts, stockings, handkerchiefs, baby-clothes, soap, pipe tobacco, rice, beans, peas, salad oil, brandy, turpentine, wax, sealing-wax and numerous medicinal articles. According to other reports conditions in Berlin are much worse than in the South German towns, and very much worse than in the country. Rations are insufficient, but hoarding is universal and is winked at by the authorities. For want of raw materials all industries, excepting actual munition factories, are terribly hampered, and the railway and tram services are seriously affected. It is still widely believed that France and Italy will soon be crushed, and that Great Britain and America will lie left to carry on a naval war alone. It is doubtful, however, whether this opinion is really shared by the Government ; the present offensive, it is suggested, has been launched to revive the hopes of an early victory excited by the peace of Brest-Litovsk.Unpopularity of Officers. The Kreuzzeitung of May 30th refers to numerous recent instances of public manifestations against officers.War Aims of German Kingdoms : Hertling and the Catholic Centre Party.  According to information received by the Foreign Office, German war aims contemplate a Prussian solution for the Balkan provinces, and a Saxon union with Lithuania. As consideration for her consent to these designs, Bavaria is claiming Alsace-Lorraine. Herr Theodor Wolff, the editor of the Berliner Tageblatt, has an article on Count von Hertling&apos;s position, which throws light on some features of the German political situation. His views reflect intelligent Radical opinion in Berlin. He says that Count von Hertling .... was always a brilliant Centre Party diplomatist. He always understood how to increase the influences which worked for that Catholic view of the world which was his creed. Everything which is now happening, or about to happen, is a triumph for this view of the world. The union, of Catholic Lithuania with Saxoiy is an instance. The annexation of Alsace to Bavaria would make the Bavarian Centre Party invincible for ever. The deepening of the alliance between Clermany and Austria-Hungary is interpreted as a holy alliance. It would be a crowning of the work if, after the complete defeat of Italy, the States of the Church could be restored. These successes of the Catholic Centre Party are helped by the existence of a Reichstag in which the parties of the Right and the National Liberals co-operate in such schemes out of blind desire of conquest. The Centre Party gives its support as a matter of course.   The Left, having been squared by the
appointment of Herr von Payer as Vice-chancellor, submits in silence. The lesson which Herr Wolff draws, in this survey of the political situation, is that the Centre party dominates German politics, and that Count von Hertling, a Bavarian Catholic holding the office of.Imperial Chancellor, provides a solid foundation for Germany&apos;s aggressive aims.Protest against Bolshevist Official Propaganda. The following wireless message was sent on June 9th by the Bolshevist Government to its representative in Berlin : -&quot; In the note of June 6th Count Mirbach declares : &apos; The Russian Government in. their radios to the diplomatic representative Joffe in Berlin conduct a public propaganda against Germany.&apos; Information follows as to the reports.sent to you relating to Press views, especially as to mutinies, repressions and skirmishes. Mirbach reminds the Russian Government of their obligation to stop such propaganda.&quot;Presidency of the Reichstag. German Wireless- of June 8th and 9th reports the election of Herr Pehrenbach (Centre Party) by 270 out of 280 votes as President of the Reichstag in succession to Dr. Kaempf. Scheidemann and Paasche were elected as Vice-Presidents. German Wireless of June 10th gives the history of Fehrenbaoh, and quotes his inaugural speech at length.Post-War Shipping. According to a report received, German ship-brokers are-offering to take up neutral tonnage, on time charter, for periods up to four years after the war, with delivery within six months after peace is declared ; for this they are prepared to pay 22 shillings per ton per month, the charterer to pay all expenses, including insurances and the cost of a German crew.   (See also Reports bios. 69 and 70.)Flax. A report received emphasizes the importance to Germany of her present control, due to the Russian collapse, of what is in peace time five-sixths of the worlchs supply of flax. Her production of aeroplanes cannot now be expected to suffer from any lack of linen material.Raw Materials. An article by Herr Dernburg in the Neue Freie Presse of May 19th on &quot; WilsoAs raw materials boycott against the Central Powers,&quot; is quoted in the Daily Review (E.P.S.) of June 6th at page 9 (and see Reports Nos. 68 and 70).NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.Recognition of German Representative. The Foreign Office is informed that on June 10th the German Charge dAffaires was officially recognised by the Argentine Government (and see Report No. 71).DENMARK.Danish Elections. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4688) dated May 25th, the Political Intelligence Department examines the results of the recent Danish elections. In the present Folketing (Lower House) the Government now has a majority of 2 in a house of 140 compared with a majority of 12 in the old Folketing, consisting of 114 members. The Socialist seats have increased from 32 to 39, and the undesirable influence of the Official Socialist Party over the Government is therefore enhanced. It remains to be seen how far the new Syndicalist group, which criticises the pro-Germanism of the Official Socialist leaders through its organ Dagens Ekko, will operate to counteract their policy. (After a two days&apos;debate on the Address, the Lower House on June 4th passed a vote of confidence in the Zahle Cabinet by 70 votes against 62.) In the Lanclsting (Upper House) the. Government parties (Radicals and Socialists) have secured 28, the Liberals and Conservatives 4-4- seats, as against the previous figures of 12 and 54 respectively. The comparative strength of parties in the Landsting, however, plays no great role in Danish politics, as the position of the Government is not affected by an adverse vote in that House (and see Reports Nos. 65 and 68).Coffee. Sir R. Paget reports complaints in the Danish Press that considerable quantities of coffee consigned to Danish purchasers are being held up in England. Owing to the serious shortage of coffee in Denmark, such statements, unless explained-or contradicted, are likely to cause animosity.
FINLAND.Finland and the Political Situation in the North of Europe. In a Memorandum (G-.T. 4765) dated June 1st, the Political Intelligence Department traces recent Finnish policy and its exploitation by Germany. Ethnological!y, the country is divided between Svecoman (Finns of Swedish descent) and Fennoman (pure Finns of Mongol stock), whose cultural rivalry seems now to have assumed a political character, placing the Fennoman party largely on the side of the Central Powers. Apart from this cultural division of the population there were and are definite political divisions  Alt (old) Finns, inclined to make the best of the Russian connection ; Young Finns, nationalist and violently anti-Russian; Agrarians, whose policy is indicated by their name ; Swedish Party, representing the political interests of the Swedish Finns ; and Socialists of the Marxian type, who from a negligible quantity grew to nearly one-half the population (as judged by proportional representation in the Landtag) in. November 191.7. Political, differences were, however, sunk in the face of Russian autocracy. . . . This was the state of feeling in Finland at the outbreak of war in 1.914 ; a deadly hatred of Russia and all. things Russian, joined to a frank and deep admi-ration for Britain and things British. In 1918 feeling has swung round into the opposite direction as regards Britain, while a third party Germany has become almost an object of adulation among a considerable section of Finns. . . . Hatred of Russia had prepared the soil; German propaganda sowed the seed ; Finnish desire to recover autonomy, which rapidly grew to Finnish desire for independence and expansion, ripened the plant, which was watered by the extraordinary apathy manifested by Britain towards Finland. . . . With her foot in Aland, Germany commands the Baitic ; with an obsequious Finland extended northwards and eastwards, she blocks the trade routes into North and Central Russia; with an ice-free port on the Arctic in the possession of her vassal, she has a free hand in the exploitation of the timber and minerals of Kola, and of the vast mineral wealth of Lapland. . . . One thing may yet disarrange these carefully laid plans. The Fennouian v. Svecoman controversy bids fair to become in the near future a bitter political struggle. Meanwhile, pending the resumption of governmental conditions in. which opinions can be freely expressed, the pro-German leaders are trading on the public gratitude for German deliverance to make the alliance with Germany politically, economically and commercially irrevocable. . To a natural desire for the recovery of autonomy, even independence, they have passed to a brutalfy imperialistic plan quite at variance with the traditions of the country ; and in gambling for that they are assisting, by all the means at their disposal, the well-defined plans of Germany for the control of Northern Europe.ddie Foreign Office learns that there is already violent dissension in the Landtag; the Svecoman party is becoming increasingly annoyed wdth the Fennoman, which is ousting it as much as possible from all Government posts; indignation has also been caused by the application of a Finnish name to the old fortress of Sveaborg. The Swedish papers of June 11th publish a statement made in the Finnish Landtag by Professor Estlander, leader of the Swedish group, that since the recent additions to the Senate, and especially since the admission&apos; to office of a person who did not inspire confidence as a member of Government, he felt that his group -was unrepresented in the Senate, which had moreover ignored the terms on which his party had offered its co-operation with the Government, ddie papers observe that the person alluded to is obviously Sario.Constitution. Mr. Grove reports that the Senate has laid a Bill before the Diet recommending a monarchical form of government. According to German. Wireless of June 7th the Finnish paper Hufvudstadbladet has objected to the French declaration regarding the Finnish proposal for a monarchy (see Report No. 71). &apos;:It is not a question of a monarchical revolution; the constitution was already monarchic and there is no majority for changing it into a Republican one.&quot; (See Reports Nos. 67-69 and the Times of June 13th, at page 6.)Finnish and German Military Forces. According to a Press message from Stockholm, the German Colonel von Reclern has arrived at Helsingfors, has been made Chief of the Staff, and has begun the reorganisation of the Army, which is to be formed on German lines, with German officers as instructors. Its peace strength is to be 9 regiments of 3 battalions (of 1,000 men) each. Swedish officers and instructors are being paid off and are returning to Sweden. Finns over 30 are demobilised until further orders. The Foreign Office is informed.that many Finnish -Generals and Colonels are resigning their commissions.   Jdie Finnish Jager battalion
from Germany is making itself very unpopular by its overbearing manner, and that the German troops are disliked on account of their constant thefts of clothing and foodstuffs.Finnish Navy. According to the Finnish Press, the Finnish Navy will be controlled by a commission consisting of one German Naval officer and one Finn.Finland and ilia North.. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, the Russian Government has agreed to cede to the Finnish Government a large part of the Murman coast, including Kola inlet, in addition to a portion of Eastern Karelia. Joffe, the Russian Plenipotentiary Representative at Berlin, informs Chicherin in a wireless (June 6th) that in reply toYhe question whether Germany considers it possible to relax the blockade of the Murman coast, if the British should leave it, Kiihlmann replied in the affirmative, and it was pointed out that there could be no doubt as to Russian navigation being left free after the embarkmeut of the British forces. German troops continue to move northward, either towards petshenga or Murmansk or possibly both. The Swedish Conservative papers publish a telegram from Helsiugfors stating that Finnish Red Guards are being trained by English officers in Eastern Karelia for a projected offensive against Finland ; and that the Finnish Red leader Manner was recently entertained on the Murman railway by English officers. German Wireless of June 3rd quotes the Stockholm agent of the Vosslsche Zeitung as giving a long account of Entente dictatorship and ambition in the Murman and Archangel regions. Sir E. Howard intimates that British collaboration with the Reds is unlikely to be approved in Sweden. StockhobAs Tidning of June 10th reports from Finland a suggestion by Br. Lailinen, Chief of the Finnish Arctic Ocean Expedition, that the Finnish Government should take diplomatic actiou to induce the British Government to consider the petshenga question apart from the Murman question. He also proposes the construction of a military road from Rovaniemi. to Kyro.   (See Reports Nos. 63, 64, 66-71, and the Times of June 13th, at page 6.)Finnish Red Prisoners. Sir E. Howard learns that the Finnish Red prisoners will probably be sent to Germany for employment in potash works, since Germany requires workmen and Finland potash.   (And see Reports Nos. 67 and 63.)Food Supply. Svenslta Dagblad&apos;s correspondent at Helsingfors telegraphs that an agreement has been reached between Finland and Germany for import from Germany of 1,000 tons of cereals, of which 300 have already arrived, and the remainder will arrive this month. It is hoped that this will enable Finland to carry on till next harvest without reduction of rations. 700 tons of salted vegetables and dried roots are also being sent and more follow. Mr. Grove reports that in exchange for the 1,000 tons of grain, Finland will send Germany 50 tons of butter. The Foreign Office learns that the food situation in fdelsingfors is very bad, and that prices for many articles are enormous. What little bread is to be had is of poor-quality.German-Finnish Commercial Treaty. Air. Grove reports the ratification by the Diet of the German-Finnish Commercial Treaty.    According to Press reports there was considerable opposition.   Speakers openly referred to it as a national calamity,&quot; and the negotiators who signed it were accused of not knowing what they were about (and see Reports Nos. 68 and 71).Economic Treaty iclth Austria-Hungary. -A Vienna telegram (June 1st) states-that the Austro-Hungarian-Finnish supplementary economic treaty (see Reports-Nos. 69 and 70) contains in substance analogous prescriptions to the treaties concluded with the Ukraine, Eussia, and Rumania, and is based on the most-favoured-nation treatment.British Balances. The Finnish Government informs Mr. Grove that it has never forbidden Banks to pay out British deposits, and it has now requested Banks to pay British subjects all monies necessary for living expenses, payment of workmen, &amp;c. Mr. Grove is instructed to press for the fulfilment of this assurance. (See Reports-Nos. 68 and 70.)MEXICO.Financial Straits of Government. The -Foreign Office learns that the financial position of the Mexican Government is critical, and that only one machine at the Mint-is working..
Seizure of Churches. Mr.. Cummins reports that under a decree of. Carranza, dated May 7til, the Mexican Government is closing and taking possession of some 30 churches in the federal district.German Propaganda, regarding Mexican Altitude towards Belligerents. A German wireless message (June 5th) states : &quot; The Swiss newspapers publish semi-official Washington reports according to which Carranza has requested the American journalist, Robert Ii. Murray, to leave Mexico. Murray was there at the head of the organisation which the American Government has created for the purpose of countering the alleged German propaganda in Mexico. It is at the same time reported that one of the correspondents of the Associated. Press in Mexico City, W. B. Wiegand, has also received a request to leave the place. With regard to the internal and external policy of Mexico, the Dutch newspaper Vaderlaud learns : &apos; Mexico has been neutral from the beginning, and the greater part of the population hope to make money out of the war. Although Carranza is pro-German, and anti-American, whilst the majority of the Liberals, out of their interests incline towards the Entente, Carranza has succeeded in maintaining neutrality. No real sympathy of the people for the Entente exists, wdrereas through the influence of the clergy, the lower classes of the population and the Indians are really friendly towards Germany. Only so recently as 19.16 Diaz, Villa and Juarez, and others were in favour of attacking the United States. That things did not go so far may apparently be attributed to the influence of Japan. When Lansing published the telegrams from which it appeared that Germany was inciting Mexico to an attack on the United States a crisis intervened, which, however, was settled. Only when the United States entered the war and commenced to worry Mexico with black lists, did the majority of the Liberals side with the policy of their leader, Carranza, who behaved in a correct manner towards the Entente, but as regards Germany was benevolently neutral. The cause of the crisis and the breaking off of the diplomatic relations with Cuba, or rather the dissension with the United States authorities in Cuba, was due to the fact that the United States pursued her policy- of crushing enemy trade not only against Mexican firms which were on the black list, but against the German vessels which had. formerly fled to Tampico, and which were used by Mexico for the voyage to Cuba. These the United States would not permit to. sail. When this happened. Carranza withdrew his diplomatic Charge cPAffaires. Even on this present occasion no real rupture will take place, as neither for Mexico nor for the United States can an aggressive policy which would lead to greater difficulties bring any advantage.&apos; &quot;Wireless Installations. The Foreign Office learns that an offer has been, made by the German Press Agency in Mexico City to send a regular news service to Japan. It is stated that one wireless station in Mexico is able to receive messages from all parts of the world, and that the Chapoltepec station can transmit to Nauen. (See also Reports Nos. IS and 55.)NETHERLANDS.Proposed Convoy to Dutch Bast Indies. With reference to the official notice in the Dutch Press that the Commander of the proposed convoy (see Reports Nos. 70 and 71) to the Dutch East Indies would not tolerate any examination of the convoyed ships, the Netherlands Foreign Minister and the Netherlands Minister in London were informed (on. April 26th and June 7th respectively) that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not recognise any- claim by such convoy for immunity from, visit and search, the right to which Great Britain, wdtether as neutral or belligerent, has consistently maintained for centuries in accordance with the rules of international law. It has been explained to the Netherlands Minister that, having regard to the opportunities officially offered to the belligerents for satisfying themselves as to the innocence of particular ships, persons and cargoes, it is difficult to understand the necessity for providing ships thus admitted to be innocent with the special protection of convoy. Nevertheless, by way of exceptional concession, not to be treated as a precedent, His Majesty&apos;s&quot;Government, taking into consideration the position in which the Netherlands Government has placed itself by its public announcement, and in order to give practical evidence of its friendly7 disposition, submits certain specified conditions, substantially7 conforming with the suggestions of the Netherlands Government itself, under which the vessels mentioned might be allowed to pass without interference through the British patrols on. the route proposed.
Diitch-German Negotiations. Sir W. Townley reports that among the outstanding matters settled between the Netherlands and German Governments is ihe exportation to Germany of 8,500 foals, being part of 17,000 originally agreed, and of the remaining horses of the 5,000 also stipulated. (Sir W. Townley is instructed to protest against the breach of the Hides Agreement involved in the export to&apos;Germany of horses and cows.) The Germans seem disposed to consent to provide coal, but the price asked is excessive.Bombs from Aeroplanes.-According to a communique, published on June 7th by the Netherlands Foreign Office, the Netherlands Minister in London has been instructed to protest against the dropping of bombs (stated to be of English make) at Sas Van Gent and Koewacht on the night of May 20th-21st, causing material damage at the latter place. It is added that the dropping of bombs by British aeroplanes appears to be more frequent than formerly.Reported Economic Agreement with Austria. According to a Vienna report to the Tyd of May 31st, a Dutch-Austrian economic agreement will shortly be signed, by which Austria obtains a monthly credit of about 7,000,000 guilders.NORWAY.Germany and Norwegian Shipping. Sir M. Findlay reports that the Norwegian-American Line is showing anxiety to obtain German safe conducts for its passenger ships. . The German proposals, however, which include the suggestion of a shipping agreement, have so far proved unacceptable, and the S.S. Bergenford sailed without safe conduct on June 6th. The Norwegian Government does not appear to be opposed, in principle to the acceptance by shipping companies of safe conducts, though it recognises that they would probably be made a lever for concessions ; there is reason, nevertheless, .to believe that it would take a very grave view of any attack upon, a vessel sailing without safe conduct.S.S. &quot; Eikundasund.&quot; With reference to the seizure by the Germans of- the S.S. Eikundasund (see Report No. 7.1), Sir M. Findlay reports that the Norwegian Government will certainly deduct the amount of fish captured from that allowed for exportation to German)- under the Norwegian-American Agreement. It does not appear that the vessel was seized by collusion, but doubtless the Germans had knowledge of her movements, as she belongs to the German Consular Agent at Egersund and was sailing under a pass from the German Legation in Christiania. Sir 1*1. Howard reports that steps are being taken, to obtain release of the steamer-arid cargo, or at any rate the latter.Submarine Attacks on Norwegian Fishing Vessels. Referring to the subn.iar.ine attacks upon Norwegian fishing vessels off the Murmaii coast (see Report No. 70), German Wireless of June 10th is very indignant with the &quot; spiteful declarations &quot; and &quot; odious articles &quot; appearing in the Norwegian Bress. &quot; Based upon reports which have now reached Berlin, it is reliably ascertained that the sinking of the fishing-vessels took place not in the free portion of the barred zone. The Norwegian fishermen must therefore put their misfortunes to their own account.&quot;SPAIN.The Ministry. Sir A. Hardinge reports rumours of a possible break up of the present National Administration. It would appear that the Conservative Ministers do not consider themselves to have been supported with sufficient vigour by certain of their Liberal colleagues in the recent debate on the suppression of the strikes last summer. It is to be hoped that the King will use his influence to hold the Ministry together, as the alternative would probably be a succession of makeshift Cabinets ending in a military dictatorship.Government Proposals for Military Reorganisation. The Government is proceeding with its scheme of military reorganisation. The Bill about to be laid before the Cortes has aroused considerable criticism and protest among the Socialists and, in a lesser degree, among the Liberals. Opposition is chiefly directed, against the increased expenditure which is proposed for the maintenance of the Spanish armed
forces. Criticism is also directed against the disproportionate number of commis-sioned officers. In spite of the fact that a law for decreasing their numbers has been passed, there has actually been an increase,   (See also Reports Nos. 61 and 63.)Spain ami the United Stales. The Daily Review reports : &quot; Owing to the increasing disinclination of Spanish shipowners to cany goods declared contraband by Germany, Spaihs commercial relations with belligerent countries leave much to be desired. Tlie most serious interruption of trade for Spain is the withholding by the United States of raw cotton owing to the refusal of Spanish shipowners to carry-to that country articles which it requires. Should no modus vivendi be found, not a single cotton mill will remain open after the middle of July, and 100,000 workmen will be out of employment. (Liberal, May 24th.) That relations between Spain, and the United States are strained is indicated by the announcement in the Qaceia of the 24th that the latter country has denounced the treaty of friendship and general relations signed between the two countries on July 3rd, .1002, and that, in consequence, it will cease to operate after May 8th, 1919. (Imparcial, May 25th.) So far, this announcement passes without comment, from, the Press.&quot;Internment of  British- Seamen.  Sir A. Hardinge reports that  the   Spanish-authorities have not persisted in their intention to intern the two British Reserve seamen gunners of the torpedoed steamship Heron Bridge (see Report No. 71).   The entire crew of the vessel has been, sent from Teneriffe to Cadiz.Pro-German Economic Propaganda. According to a report received, a very pro-Gorman, attitude, is maintained by the Madrid journal Espana Economica. y Financia,SWEDEN.y\nglo-Sivedish Shipping Agreement : German Intimidation. Particulars of the Agreement (signed on June 5th) between the Swedish, negotiators and the British, French, and Italian Governments are reported in Memorandum G.T. 4778 of June 6th, Sir E. Howard is informed that the Agreement will, be ratified by the Swedish. Government on Julie 14th. According to Dagens Nyheter of June 6th, a circular in the Swedish language, but apparently printed in Germany, is being distributed in Gothenburg among the crews of vessels loading for British ports, stating that, Swedish seamen are murdered in England. The police are investigating the matter (and see the Times of June .13th. at, page 5). In the Deutsche Tageszeitung of June 1st Count Reventlow characterises the Swedish-English shipping agreement as an. unfriendly act, on the part, of Sweden towards Germany, which breathes an. unneutral spirit, and says :--&quot; As regards the great, part of Swedish harbours, it will depend on Germany as to whether or not, Swedish vessels lying there will get, into enemy hands.&quot;Mines in the Kattegat. Sir E. Howard has been, authorised to issue an emphatic denial that any British mines have been laid in territorial, waters (and see Reports Nos. 69 and 71).Transit Goods in Sweden. The Foreign Office approves generally, subject to certain suggestions, the proposals transmitted by Sir E. Howard regarding the disposal of transit, goods in Sweden, (see Reports Nos. 66, 69 and 70--; also No. 68 under &quot;Norway &quot;).SWITZERLAND,Federal Government and the Bolshevists. Sir If. Rumbold learns that the Federal Government is disposed to recognise the Bolshevist Government in Russia, but hesitates to incur the suspicion of unneutral conduct by following a course which, up till now, has only been taken by the Central Powers ; it would, however, supplement the de facto relations already set up, by according formal recognition if the example were set by any of the Entente Powers ; and the belief apparently exists in Swiss Government circles that such recognition is shortly to be given by the United States Government, The official call of the Bolshevist Mission has not, so far, been returned by the British, French or Italian Representatives.Tonnage for Swiss Supplies. Sir IL Ruaibdld reports that the German Govern-ment has consented in principle&apos; to the use by Switzerland during the war of certain5373 2&apos;j P
German ships interned in Spain on condition that they are employed solely for the transport of goods destined for Switzerland and that they.are given back to Germany upon the conclusion of peace.- With regard to Austrian vessels, the Federal Govern-ment is negotiating direct with the owners, who are in communication with their Government. The latter also requires an undertaking that the vessels will, not be requisitioned&apos; by the Allies or employed&apos;directly or indirectly in their service. The owners reserve the right to possession of the ships at the conclusion of peace, but; subject to this, are prepared to admit their continued employment for a certain period by Switzerland. To permit of. the use of the Swiss flag, the acquisition will probably take the form of a safe with right of re-purchase. As the total monthly overseas requirements of Switzerland (about 70,000 tons) would necessitate the purchase of some 48 ships of 5,000 tons each at the cost (impossible to Switzerland) of about 300,000,000 francs, the Federal Government is likely at present to buy only 10 ships, enough to carry approximately 20,000 tons per month from New York to Cette, supplementing tonnage chartered from Spain or other neutral countries.The Federal Government has asked the consent of the German Government to the employment of Dutch tonnage lying up in Dutch ports for the transport of cereals to Gette.   It is probable that the- Germans will stipulate against their requisition by the Allies or their use in. Allied, interests.   So far as His Majesfy&apos;s Government is concerned, there would be no objection to this, provided arrangements were made whereby the vessels should be made responsible for coal required by them for bunkering purposes without calling upon tonnage under Allied.control   The Federal Government has been advised to ascertain the views of the United States Government in the&apos;matter.   Disparaging tlie safe arrival at Bordeaux of grain ships from America (see Report No. G8), German Wireless of dune Gt.li observes: &quot;According to Swiss reports to the Berlin newspapers, the two American grain ships which, after long negotiations with Washington, had been accorded to Switzerland, have arrived in the harbour of Bordeaux, and are being detained by the French Government; which, in its&apos;customary express methods, exploits the situation in order to put forward a demand for a credit in gold.   The  Vossiselie Zeiiuncj remarks in this connection:   1 It. will now presumably be clear, even to the Swiss papers of The West, which, on the occasion of the Paris coal offer, sent up the usual French, incense, that the purest egoism, and not sentimental friendship, leads tlie French Government. &apos; It is also quite clear that the United States have deliberately played a trump card into the. hands of France when they declined to allow the grain ships to travel imder the Swiss flag to Gette, the Mediterranean port, as hitherto, and made the American flag and an escort, of warships a condition.   As always in her effort to bear in mind the difficult-situation of Switzerland, Germany has granted, the wishes expressed at Berne ; both grain ships have arrived safely in a French port, but a fresh tribute must be paid before the urgently needed freight is allowed to arrive at its destination.   Now the people in Sweden will be able to picture to themselves what has been gained by the permission, obtained with so much difficulty, to buy grain from the Argentine !   Til Norway also the&apos; people will attach, less value to the new Treaty which lias just been concluded with Washington.   The violation of neutrals by the Entente has become a system.&apos; &quot;German Economic Penetration. A report received&apos; indicates that the Germans are making strenuous efforts to corner orders for material-required in connection with the electrification of the Federal Railways.Goal for Switzerland. Phis Majesty&apos;s Government has undertaken to furnish to France an additional 6,000 tons of coal per month, in order to permit of the supply of that amount to Switzerland.THE VATICAN.Corpus Ghristi Bay. Cardinal Gasparri, Papal Secretary.of State, has transmitted through Count. deSalis the thanks of the Holy See to His MajestyA Government for. the wdllingness with which it accepted tlie VaticaAs proposal to spare Cologne from bombardment on Corpus Christi Day. Oil June 2nd the Bope gave an audience to a number of cardinals, and expressed&apos; his strong indignation at the bombardment of Bails by the Germans on Corpus Christi Day: He stated that he had telegraphed to Cardinal Hartmann, Archbishop of Cologne, on this matter. . Theofficial Vatican organ,
the Osservatore Romano, on June 3rd published the official correspondence containing Cardinal Hartmann&apos;s request for the Pope&apos;s intervention Avith the Abies to spare Cologne on that clay. The Pope&apos;s appeal to the British Government, communicated through Count de Salis, is included. Cardinal Gasparri, in his reply to Cardinal Hartmann, and in his Notes to Count de Salis and to. the Archbishop of Paris, expresses the Pope&apos;s confidence that all belligerents will respect the solemn festival of Corpus Christi. The documents refer to the praiseworthy and noble deference Avith which the British Government acceded to the Pope&apos;s request, and, with a high sense of humanity and religion, made known that orders had been given to refrain on that day from air-raids on cities distant from the war zone. The Catholic Press puts forward the argument that if the Pope refrains from explicit condemnation of German crimes it is due to the fear that any such pronouncement would have no effect but to rouse the hostility of Germany and prevent the Pope from doing anything in future to relieve the sufferings of prisoners of war. German Wireless of June 7th elaborately explains that, &quot; in accordance with&apos;the Concordat of April 4th, 1802, between Pius VI. and the First Consul, Cardinal Caprara issued the Decree of April 9th, 1802, which is still valid for the Roman Catholic Church in France ; according to which only four Holy Days were to be celebrated in France on weekdays, and all others (including Corpus Christi Day) postponed to the following Sunday.&quot; It is added that, by order of the High Command, Paris was not bombarded on that day (and see Report No. 71).PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. German violations of the Brest Treaty continue, ddie possession of the Russian Black Sea Fleet appears to be one of their main objects. This question -dominates all others, as affecting the Middle East.Russia. -On dune Gth Russian Wireless published a message from M. Joffe reporting that the following questions had been submitted to von Kuhlmann about the German interpretation of the Brest Treaty, the substance of the German reply to each question is given in brackets : (1) Whether the German Government mean that their Note gives a completeguarantee for the ending of the war, the Caucasian and Finnish frontsbeing included ?   (Yes, as far as possible.) (2) Whether they agree that the disarmed -ships must not be shelled by any ofthe Powers, including the Germans?   (Yes.) (3) AVhether they agree that a new boundary line does not mean the surrender of new places to the Germans, and also agree that no new places shall be occupied by German troops ?   (No reply.) (4) Whether they consider it possible to relax their blockade of the Murman coast,if the English should leave it &apos;?   (Yes).In the opinion of the Germans the return of Sebastopol was considered to be a question to be decided by the political mission.Russian Wireless of June 9th published a message from M. Chicherin to Joffe at Berlin, which appears to contain an undertaking on the part of the Germans not to make use of the ships of the Black Sea Fleet, and adding that the Russians will accept the condition. Russian Wireless of June 10th confirms this, ddie German under-taking for what such undertakings are worth is &quot; not to use the ships before a general peace is concluded.&quot;Russian Wireless of June 8th announced that, without awaiting the settlement of the form in which the independence of Lettonia is to be established under the Brest Treaty &quot;on the basis of   self-determination,.the German Military authorities&apos; are^ introducing German programmes into the elementary schools.   Details are given.Russian Wireless of June 7th published the conditions proposed by the Russian Delegation for an armistice with the German-f7forai?ie troops. A temporary arrange-ment appears to have been made for the co-operation of the railways, pending the final determination of the Peace Treaty.   On June 2nd the Ukrainian Delegation put5873-26
forward a proposal for the creation of a Commission to fix the boundary line to indicate-the future frontiers between Russia and the Ukraine. The Russians protested, pointing out that the conclusion of an armistice must come first. On June 9th,. M. Chicherin announced by Russian Wireless that, according to a compromise come-to with the Ukrainian Delegates on the Military Boundary. Commission, there has been a further loss to Russia of 25,000 square versts of territory.According to a report forwarded by Mr. Wardrop on May 28th (received June 6th) the Beace Conference at Batoum about Caucasia was broken up on May 25th by an irresistible advance of the Turks on the whole Ears front and at Erihan. The Georgians protested.Finland. German Wireless of June 6th published a report from Helsingfors that the German-Finnish Peace Treaty and the Commercial and Shipping Agreement had been accepted by the Diet at their third reading.Germany. German Wireless of June 7th quotes an article in the Norddeutsclic Allgemeine Zeitnng protesting against the alleged misuse in connection with peace-discussions of the expression &quot; League of Nations &quot; by the Entente Powers. .The Daily Review (June 4th) publishes the substance of demands being made in the German Press for a statement of German war aims against Great Britain (Kreiizzeitung and Vormarts).Austria-Hungary. Russian Wireless of June 8ch reported a message from the Austrian Government agreeing to the formation of a mixed Commission at Moscow for settlement of the questions embodied in Article 4, Clause 3 of the Russo-Austro-Hungarian Supplementary Treaty. This Commission will settle questions regarding stock exchange values, &amp;c. .Great Britain. Sir E. Howard on June Sth reported the issue of an invitation by Mr. Henderson to Mr. Brantmg (Stockholm) to attend a London Conference on June 26th. On June 10th Sir W. Townlej- forwarded an appreciation of the character and attributes of M. Troelstra (Netherlands), said to1 have received a similar invitation.
