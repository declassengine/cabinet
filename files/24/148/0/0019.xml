Special attention is drawn, to reports of her policy of attaching to all &quot; peace &quot; treaties numerous supplementary agreements, all tending to her economic, financial, naval, or military advantage.. These points are brought out under Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and Finland.General (page 2).Ratification of the Franco-German agreement about exchange of prisoners is reported, and an interpretation is given of the new German Prize regulations.Belgium (page 3).In addition to suppressing Belgian civil jurisdiction (Report 63), allowing officials to advertise, an annexation policy (Report 64), underfeeding the people (Report 65), separating the financial administration, of Flemish and Walloon, districts (Report 66), and enslaving Belgian youths and boys to work behind the German lines (Report 67), latest reports show that the Germans are applying starvation to impose their will upon the population, who are now said to be faced with actual famine.1 It seems possible that, as anticipated in the Appreciation to Report No. 66, this policy has been adopted by the German Government deliberately as a means of exacting concessions to their demands, whether in Belgium or elsewhere. Report No. 64 (page 4) recorded the diversion to Belgium of 10,000 tons of wheat cargoes destined for France and England, and, if the German policy has been interpreted correctly, strong safeguards seem to be necessary to ensure that these cargoes reach the population, for whom they are intended.Brazil (page 4).The British Mission to friendly South American Republics has arrived.France (page 5) and Italy (page 5).

FART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.GSNEEAL.Far Fast. Sir 0. Greene reports that the Japanese landing force at Vladivostock has been reduced to 400 men. The Allied Consuls have established unofficial relations with the local Soviet, which has now dissolved the Zemstvo.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period. May 3rd-9th, inclusive, was 09,294 tons gross, of which 53,832 were British, as compared with 79,968 tons gross, of which 59,161 were British, reported last week.Construction. According to an Admiralty announcement dated May 9th, the gross tonnage of merchant vessels completed in United Kingdom yards and the tonnage launched in Allied and neutral countries during the years 1915, 1916, and 1917, and the quarter ended March 31st, 1918, are as set out below : Period.

The Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding makes the following comments : &quot;The output for
April&apos; 1918,-although not reaching the. high figures for March 1918, is 60 per cent&quot; higher than the month of April .1.9.17. The upward tendency in the rate of annual output is steadily maintained. The la.unch.ings in January and February 191.8 were low, for reasons already explained, and this is reflected, in the tonnage of completions now issued. It should be noted that the April output has been achieved notwith-stnndiug the very large increase in the merchant ships which have been repaired and returned to service. Since January the increase amounts to 40 per cent., and this work has placed a severe strain on the shipbuilding and marine engineering resources of the country.&quot;German Prize Regulations.-Referring to the new paragraph in the German Prize Regulations (see Report &quot;No. 67), the War Trade Intelligence Bureau observes that it may be regarded as an extreme statement of German policy, under cover of which the Germans will probably introduce a system of safe conducts for ships exclusively engaged in neutral trade. The Germans have notified Spanish shippers and Customs agents that they may obtain German safe conducts to cover non-contraband cargo destined for Switzerland via Cette, or for America and the Philippines. Safe conducts will also be issued to vessels sailing for America to load cargoes for consumption in. Spain or Switzerland.. They will not, however, be granted to vessels which refuse to carry cargo for firms on the Allied Black List,Franco-German Agreement regarding Exchange and Internment of Prisoners.  Lord Derby reports that the Franco-German Agreement regarding exchange and internment of prisoners (see Reports Nos. (5(5 and 67) has been already ratified by the French and German Governments. Lord Derby is instructed to press the French Government to place a very strict limitation upon the rate of exchange. A statement by Lord Newton on this subject is reported in the Times of May 16th at page 8,Invalids interned inFIollandi-The Foreign Office informs Sir W. Townley that His Majesty&apos;s Government has now proposed, that the selection of invalids in Holland for repatriation &quot;shall be made by a Commission of Dutch medical officers. (And see Report No. 67.) His Majesty&apos;s Government is also prepared to come to an arrange-ment with, the German Government whereby repatriation of combatants from Holland shall lie effected under the same standard of disabilities as direct repatriation from Great Britain and Germany respectively.Poison Gas. Sir .11. Rumbold reports that a joint reply regarding the use of poisonous gases has been returned to the President of the International Red Cross by the French, Italian, British, Japanese and Portuguese Ministers. (And sec Reports Nos. 55, 65 and 66.)ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.Ihiod Situation. The Belgian. Government has appealed to the British and French. Governments on. behalf of the population of the occupied regions of Belgium, which is stated to be in immediate danger of starvation unless foodstuffs can be provided by the Allies. The French Government has already made representations to the United States Government in the matter.Socialist War Aims. -The Daily Review- reports : &quot;The Belgian Labour leaders, among them the President and the Secretary of the Internationale, Vandervelde and Huysmans, the latter an active participant in the Stockholm Peace Conference,, have met in London and issued a manifesto stating the war aims of their party. The following summary is taken from the Independance (May 6th) which congratulates itself on the fact that 0. Huysmans has signed the manifesto of patriotic Belgian Socialists. While rejoicing in the faithfulness and union which have prevailed among Belgian Socialists since the war, the &quot;manifesto recalls some fundamental principles of their policy. The national and democratic defence against the aggression of the Central Empires is their first duty. No tyranny can be thrown off if the yoke of Hoheuzollerns and Hapsburgs is accepted.   The so-called &apos; peace &apos; of Brest-Litovsk
shows how a nation can end by giving itself over. Whatever happens, Belgian Labour will not submit. The confused doctrine put forward under the name of Zimmerwald or Kienthai leads neither to peace nor to democratic progress, and is repudiated. Belgian Labour will not lend itself to any aggression that might turn the war of defence into a war of conquest, and it is entirely opposed to .annexations1. Its war aims, [already stated by the Interallied Conference in London and by the American democracy are : a League of Nations through universal democratic guarantees, cultural, autonomy to all nationalities, which, must all be freed from foreign rule; no revenge on the conquered, no attempt at economic oppression. Belgium must obtain, damages for losses suffered by her,-and be fully restored in political, economic, and in military matters. On this there can be no compromise, and it is as necessary for the peace of Europe as for the future safety of Belgium. No interference from the invader must be tolerated under colour of favouring the Flemings. The traitors calling themselves Activists are repudiated. Flemish, freedom does not demand the division of Belgium into two powerless parts. The unity of the country is a historical and. moral necessity, and linguistic equality, theoretical and practical, must be secured within its frame. After the peace it will come about as irresistibly as political equality, the granting of a single vote to each man, which has always been a demand of the party. -Finally, an. International Socialist Congress is demanded, to beheld in neutral territory by all organisations that have clearly and publicly declared in favour of peace without , annexations, without punitive indemnities, and founded on the right of self-deter-mination of peoples. These organisations must also promise to do everything in their power to induce their Governments to apply those principles at the official peace conference. The Nation Beige (May 4th), which has lately been advocating &apos; national Socialism,&apos; founded on the mutual respect and confidence of employers and employed, welcomes the manifesto, while regretting that some internationalist illusions should still have found place in it. It prefers the unambiguous protests of the Socialists within the occupied districts, and trusts that the clear-sigh redness and. firmness of American Labour will render harmless the conventional formulas patronised by the Interallied Conference of London. It congratulates the signatories, for adopting a clearly national attitude, and. rejoices to see the name of Camille Huysmans, besides those of Yandervekle and de Brouckere. It wishes that he may in future save himself from being turned aside by his prepossessions as Secretary of the Inter-nationale. Whoever realises the necessity for the future of Belgium, that all parties should meet in a common care for the national welfare will rejoice at the attitude of the Labour leaders at their London meeting.&quot;    (See also under &quot;Italy.&quot;)BRAZIL.Arrival of British. Mission. A. special British Mission under Sir Maurice tie Bunsen arrived in Brazil on May 8th. The objects of the Mission are to get into closer touch with those South American Republics which have shown their sympathy with the Entente Bowers, to discuss economic questions, and. to instruct British Diplomatic Representatives in South America on broad questions of policy. According to the Tribuna (May 9th), the British Special. Envoy, in presenting his credentials to the President of the Republic, dwelt on&apos; the evident tendency towards a political and economic rapprochement, between Great Britain and Brazil, and suggested that this tendency should be strengthened by a demonstration, the form of which should be discussed by the Governments of the two countries. The President assured Sir Maurice de Bunsen that Brazil was firmly resolved to draw still, closer the traditional ties of friendship between the two countries. In subsequent conversation, the British Minister and the President expressed, the hope that the British Diplomatic Representative in Brazil would he raised to the rank of Ambassador. (The Foreign Office informs Sir A. Feel that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to accept a Brazilian Ambassador, and intends to appoint a British Ambassador to Brazil on next change.) The Mission will probably visit Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Santiago, La Baz, Lima, Quito, and Panama.CHINA.Internal Dissensions. Plostilities between North and South continue (see Report No. 54); and the internal situation seems likely to remain unsettled.   The only
FRANCE.United States Labour, Leaders and French, Socialists. ddie nine Labour leaders -of the American Mission on May Gth took part in a Conference at the Headquarters of the Confederation Generale du Travail, ddie Americans adopted a strong line against an International Labour Conference until Germany had been beaten. M. Longuet, 1VL Jouhaux, and M. Renauclel spoke in favour of the International, which, they said was continually gaining ground among the working classes, although no Frenchman wanted such a peace as had been imposed upon the Russians, ddie war, however, must not be continued one moment longer than necessary.A Press report states : &quot; One of the last public functions of the American Mission was to receive 15 French Socialists, representative of the majoritaire fraction of the Socialist Party, headed by M. Alexandre Varenne. In an address, M. Varenne assured the Americans of their hearty support of the American standpoint. As for the German Social Democracy, he continued, it appears to us less than ever worthy to figure in a general Socialist Conference. Not only has it not replied to the pre-liminary questions asked by us, but it has allowed to be committed, if it has not helped to commit, at Brest-Litovsk a new crime of violence. It has approved the violation, of Belgian neutrality. It has allowed Russian democracy to be crushed. With such men and in such conditions, conversation is impossible. ddie same Socialists who presented an address to the American Labour Mission have sent a similar telegram to M. Branting, whom, they hail as the defender of the rights of. peoples, one who was not afraid to renounce neutralism of opinion and arraign the old. German Social Democratic Party. These Socialists, headed by M. ivlexaiidre Varenne, represent half the Unified Socialist Parliamentary Group. It is significant that MM. Albert Thomas, Renaudel, and Sembat are not among the signatories, whom M. Longuet already brands as not real Socialists. What the significance of this step may be it would lie premature to say, but this much at least is clear, it will widen the cleavage already visible, which M. Thomas and M. Renaudel are doing their utmost to minimise.&quot;GUATEMALA.German Propaganda and Guatemala&apos;s Declaration of War.-.1 German Wireless of May 11th quotes statements by the German Press in which the declaration by Guatemala of war upon Germany (see Report No. 65) is ascribed to her economic dependence upon the United States.   (See also under &quot;Nicaragua/&apos;)ITALY.Czeclw-Slovah National Army. Sir R. Rodd reports the signature of a convention between the Italian Government and the Czecho-Slovak. National Council, under &quot;&quot;wdiich recognition is accorded to the Czecho-Slovak National Army.   (See Report No. 67.)   The majority of the Czecho-Slovak prisoners in Italy have volunteered for rservice.3681-136ej) -substantial issue appears to be, whether the original Parliament shall be reconvened or a new one elected under the regulations prepared by the Council nominated by the Military party.Russian Indemnity. Sir. J. Jordan reports . that the Chinese Go verm pent has. intimated, its intention to retain moneys due (as from May 1918) on account of the Russian indemnity pending the recognition of a legitimate Russian Government. Under such an arrangement, funds would no longer be available from this source for -the maintenance of Russian diplomatic and consular establishments in China and -elsewhere.
Anniversary of Itah/s entry into the War. Sir R. iiodcl reports that the French Government will be represented at the anniversary celebration in home of Italy&apos;s entry into the Avar (May 24-th). It is stated that France will be represented by M, Simon, Minister of Colonies, the United States by Mr. Lloyd Griscom, formerly Ambassador at Rome, and Belgium by M. Maeterlinck; Great Britain will also be suitably represented.Italian Socialist Union and the War. According to the Popolo d&apos;Ilalia. (May 13th) the Congress of the Italian Socialist Union opened (May 12th) in the Costanzi Theatre. Among those attending it were the Ministers Bissolati (without portfolio), and Berenini (Public Instruction), the Deputies De Ambris, Basile, and Mazzolaui. Libero Grassi. of Udine, presided. The Deputy Vercelloni, in welcoming the delegates, said the object of the Union was to bring together all Socialists who approved of Italy&apos;s intervention for the defence of the country, national interests, and the social interests of workers. In conclusion, he read, a telegram from the Irredentist Social. Democrats closing with the words &quot; delenda Austria,&quot; which called forth a storm of applause from the meeting. Man idea reviewed . the reasons&apos; for the formation of the Italian Socialist Union. Ensuing speakers included. Grassi, Mazzolani, who spoke in the name of the Republican Party, and. De Ambris, who is an Independent Syndicalist. Bissolati declared that as adherents of the Italian Socialist Union neither he nor Signor Berenini were obliged to depart from the path they had chosen and which they had long trodden. &quot; We left,&quot; he said, &quot;the official Socialist Party because it separated itself more and more from Socialist most-ement, life and realities, and persisted in its prejudice against the war.. However, numerous Socialist reformers, revolutionaries, and trades unionists under-stood their duty better and united their efforts in defence of the cause of humanity, the fate of which depends on the battles in France and Picardy, and will soon depend on those in the Alps and on the Piave. The Socialist world is divided, into three parties, that of the German Socialists, who march with their Empires towards the conquest of the world, that of the Entente Socialists, who resist a monstrous and horrible aggression, and that of the Leninists, a miserable company, who, under the-pretext of working for peace, refuse to fight the Germans, and thus assist them in their designs. To this last party we owe a Russia handed over to the Germans and, as a consequence, our own disaster at Caporetto and the present menace on the Western front. To the German and Leninist Socialists we should oppose all our powers of resistance for the honour of true Socialism. Soldiers and workmen are comprehending more and more that in fighting for Italy they are defending&quot; the possibility for themselves and for their children of right and justice in the full independence of their will and in an inviolable Italy.&quot; The Minister Berenini, who-. spoke next, expressed, his agreement with Bissolati. &quot;Those behind the front,&quot; he said, &quot; should cherish the same faith as that of those who are in the trenches fighting for their country and in a measure preparing the way for a society of. nations,&quot; and he concluded by declaring his confidence in the success of the aims of the Italian Socialist Union. The Congress decided to send telegrams of sympathetic greeting to M. Ahtndervelde, to the Socialist parties of the Allies, and to Ilerve. Great, enthusiasm was excited by the resolve to dispatch a telegram of greeting to the soldiers at the front through the Commander-in-Chief, General Diaz. Italian Wireless of May 14-th reports: The Italian Socialist Union Congress has concluded its sittings. The Order of the Day declared the need of accord between Italy and the Jugo-Slavs, and also the necessity for the dissolution of the Austrian Monarchy in order to create new, free States capable of defending, themselves against Pan-German danger. (See also under &quot;Belgium.&quot;)Charge against Socialist Leaders. Ten leaders of the Official Socialist -Party, who-are now under arrest, are to be tried at Turin by court-martial for treason. They are charged with instigating revolt, with provoking the Turin riots of August 1917, when a general strike was proclaimed, and with having prophesied a bread famine. There-was in fact a bread famine for 24- hours, which was used to incite the people of Turin to revolt. The defendants are also charged with spreading defeatist propaganda in the Army and instigating soldiers to desert, Signor Serrati, editor of the Avanti, the organ of the Official Socialists, is included among the Socialists accused of treason in-conuection with the Turin riots.
ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Visit of the Emperor Charles to the Kaiser. A Berlin official telegram announces that the Emperor Charles, accompanied by Baron Burian, the Chief of the Austrian General Staff, and the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at Berlin, visited the Kaiser on May i2th at Main Headquarters. Germany was represented by the Imperial Chancellor, Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorlf, and the German Ambassador at Vienna. &quot;All fundamental, political, economic and military questions affecting the present and future relations of both Monarchies were thoroughly discussed. There was complete accord on all these questions, and on the extension and deepening of the existing alliance, ddie guiding lines of contemplated contractual agreements already exist in principle.&quot; A. Vienna telegram to the Frankfurter Zeitung says :   &quot;Count BuriaiPs journey to the German Headquarters gains increased importance from the negotiations now pending, which will decide the future relations between the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, ddiese negotiations may he characterised as a pragmatic alliance, a military union, and a Customs union. Constitutional sanction of this alliance requires a two-thirds majority in the Austrian Reichsrath, and it is doubtful whether this can be obtained. The great Austrian question of the day is whether the continued, existence of a separate Austrian State is possible, which the South Slavs, and now also the German provinces, deny. One party desires the State to consist of-a number of small sovereign States, each having its own foreign policy ; the other party demands a return to the German Federation, which would render the centrifugal efforts of the smaller nations harmless, ddie outcome of this condition of chaos is still uncertain.&quot;Redistribution of Provinces. A Berlin telegram to the Tpd (May 8th) states that the Budapest newspaper, Az, Est, understands that the appointment of Di\ Wekerle to the Hungarian Premiership will be followed by a sensational event. &quot; There is the question of the incorporation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and perhaps also of Dalmatia, in Hungary for the purpose of gaining Hungary&apos;s support for Austria&apos;s Polish policy.&quot; The Lokal-Anzeiger publishes a similar report, which adds that Dr. Wekerle will announce this by royal authority, ddie Vossische (May 7th), under the heading &quot; Union of Southern Slavs? &quot; publishes from its Vienna correspondent, Dr. Alexander Redlich, a statement that, although the official announcement may not be expected immediately, there is no doubt that Bosnia and Herzegovina are shortly to be joined to Hungary. &quot; Moreover, it is asserted with reasonable certainty that at last the separation of Dahnatia from Austria and its addition to Hungary, to which it properly belongs, will at least be taken into serious considera-tion.   These alterations can only be regarded as a compensation granted by thePORTUGAL. &apos;President Paes. According to a Press Report, Major Sidonio Paes was publicly-proclaimed President on May J Oth. In the course of a speech at the City Hall, he declared that &quot; the accusation that his companions were anti-Ally were calumnies. The country was more than ever engaged in the work of the Allies against the common enemy.&quot; The report adds that the Government has placed its resignation in the hands of the President, and that a new administration is being formed. The Foreign Office has authorised Sir L. Carnegie to accord formal recognition to the President so soon as the Allied Ministers, receive similar instructions.Anti-Ally Propaganda. There has been an increase in the anti-Ally propaganda carried on by some Monarchist newspapers, notably the Dia. It is reported that large sums are being spent by German agents to undermine the fidelity of the Army to the President.Food Situation. ddie food situation in Portugal is reported as being acute, the cost of living having increased 157 per cent, since July 1914.
King to the Hungarians in order to obtain from them their consent to a policy which hitherto they have for the most part disapproved. This policy can only refer to Poland, and it is now intelligible, as I reported some time ago, that Baron Burian, in contrast.with his former attitude, has accepted the principle of the Austro-Polish solution. I. presume that he Avill shortly have the opportunity to put this policy into practice.&quot; The Vienna papers recently stated that a visit of the Austrian Emperor and Baron Burian to the KaisePs Headquarters would be connected with the settlement of the Polish question. The concessions to Hungary, indicated by Redlich, would, also explain the Austrian Emperor&apos;s apparent volte face on the question of Hungarian Electoral Reform. The Budapest correspondent of the Yossisclte Zeitung observes : &quot; While Bosnia and Herzegovina.are to be attached to the Hungarian.State and are not to be connected with. Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia is to be added with Croatia-Shtvonia to the lands of the Hungarian Crown. The meaning of this differential treatment is obvious. The changes of territory mentioned are intended to prevent the formation of the nucleus of a compact South Slav State within the territory of the Hungarian Crown.&quot; Italian Wireless of May 13th declares : &quot; Austria is opposed to Jugo-Slav unity, is anxious to disunite the Slovenes so as to put them under German influence, and wishes to create a large Croatia so as to counterbalance Serbian tendencies. The newspaper Tagespost says that &apos; Minister ZolgeFs retirement shows the beginning of the new policy which Seidler favours for putting a brake upon the Jugo-Slav mover ment. Seidler has declared that the outlet to the Adriatic must remain German property. Therefore the Jugo-Slav State question must be considered as settled. There remains the problem of a Croatian State, which interests Austria and Hungary, but the Slovene and Serbian problems cease to exist.&apos; Now the Jngo-Slav and Czech groups are busy organising resistance against the Germano-Alagyar activities and demands.&quot; (The Times of May 16th at page 5 discusses the national problems of Austria-Hungary, with special reference to German-Magyar influence.)Personnel and Policy of New Hungarian Cabinet. According to a Budapest telegram to the Dutch papers the Wekerle Cabinet has been constituted as follows : Premier and Minister of the Interior, Dr. Wekerle.1Minister of Commerce, M. Joseph Szterenyi.1Minister of Agriculture, Count Bela Serenyi.-Ministef of Education, Count John Zlchy.Minister of Finance, M. Popo witch..&apos;Minister of Food, Prince Windischgraetz.2Minister of Defence, Baron Szurmay.Minister of Court Affairs, Count Aladar Zichy.3Minister of Justice, M. Gustav Toery.Minister for Croatia, Dr. Unkelhauser.Minister for Social Affairs, Count Paid Teleki.4&quot;Dr. Wekerle has made a statement, in which he says that the Government intends to introduce various small amendments in the suffrage proposals, based on a compromise-mise that will make acceptance of the proposals possible. The amendments provide that every citizen who would not otherwise have a right to a vote shall obtain one if he has given proof of sufficient intellect, has passed through four classes of the national school, and is also master of the Hungarian language, or if he has passed through six classes of the national school. The Premier adds that Avorkmen will have the vote, that the extension of the suffrage will be carried out forthwith, and that the Govem-ment will maintain its social and economic programme and its plan of army reform.&quot;The Political Intelligence Department, in a preliminary estimate, describes the new Cabinet as representing three elements, the high Roman Catholic aristocracy connected with the Vienna Court, the business men connected with, German finance, and the bureaucracy which carries on its work as it is told to. Its salient feature is the absence of strong political individualities, either from Tisza&apos;s own party or from, among his opponents, the groups of Counts Andrassy, Apponyi, and Karolyi. It looks like a slight recovery of the Vienna Court from its surrender to Tisza as-shown by the appointment of Burian..   (And see Report No. 66.)1 Financiers, who closely associate the economic in tores ts of Hungary Avith those of Germany. &quot; Representing, the high feudal aristocracy.3 One of the main leaders of the clerical Roman Catholic People&apos;s Party, very closely connected with the Vienna Court.4 Representing the Magyar interests in Transylvania.
GERMAIN Y.German Opinions on the War. According to a report received by the Foreign Gllice, the commercial and educated classes in Germany were convinced, even after the preliminary success of the offensive of March 21st, that the war was at a deadlock. So far these Ci.e.. banking, shipping, commercial and professor) classes have been unable to make their opinions felt, because the whole country is under military domination, if, however, the prospect of renewed trench warfare&apos; recurs, they intend to start a very strong peace offensive, on the basis of surrendering Belgium and Northern France on condition of retaining their hold upon. Russia, which is to repay i heir losses in the war. It is added that Socialist influence has perceptibly dwindled, and that strikes arc extremely improbable. (And see Report No. 06.) Criticism, however, is symptomatic. Yorwurts of May 11th, referring to the official reception of von Kiihhnanu on his return, from Bucharest, observes: &quot; . . . . The masses feel no enthusiasm for the condition of semi-war which is ail that has been achieved. Had a peace been concluded in the East which really brought war there to a conclusion and gave a good prospect for the speedy attainment of the same in the West, then would all Berlin have been at the station to greet herr von Kiihlmann. As it. was, he had to content himself with, the honour of an official reception.&quot;   (See also Reports Nos. 66 and 67.)The Ukraine. Mi&apos;. Lockhart reports the formation by General Skoropadsky (see Report No. 67) of a new Cabinet, which includes three members of the Cadet Party. The Hetman has issued a declaration re-establishing the right to private property, but authorising the division of large estates amongst the poorer agriculturists. The rights of workers are guaranteed, &quot; special attention, being paid to the improvement of labour conditions for railway workers.&quot; Freedom of commerce is also established financially and economically. According to the Russian Press, the Germans have declared an armistice between the Ukraine and Russia. On May 7th Trotsky issued an order to the Russian troops in the south to resist all German attempts to cross the line of demarcation. Air. Lockhart points out, that while German action in the Ukraine has seriously provoked the Bolshevists, it should at the same time be observed that there will be a temptation to the Russian &quot;Bourgeois&quot; classes to gather round the new German-Ukrainian nucleus of &quot; ordered &quot; government. A reliable informant reports that the Germans are likely to obtain grain and fodder from the Ukraine at the rate of one million poods (about 16,000 tons) per month during the next three or four months, and should also be able to effect transport at that rate. There is little or no wheat, but maize, barley, oats, and a certain quantity of fodder are available. It is also possible that cheese, butter, and sugar will be obtainable from Bessarabia and the vicinity of Odessa. According to another report, &quot;the two routes used for the&apos; transport of the grain are via Lemberg and up the Danube via Braila. Much hard work has been done on the railway, and most of the damage has been restored. The line from Kieff to Kovel. is being converted to German gauge. There is still difficulty over the shortage of fuel and rolling-stock, but matters in. this respect have improved since the Germans penetrated farther east to the junctions of Kharkov and Ekaterinosiav. A considerable quantity of rolling-stock was left at these junctions by the Bolshevists. With regard to river transport, Herr von Braiuds figures show that little is being done in this.direction, probably owing to the removal of ships from Odessa. But the barges from the North Sea ports should- have arrived by this time, and improvements are to be expected. It may be concluded. (1) that of the small quantities that will reach the enemy before the harvest, the lion&apos;s share &quot;will be reserved for Austria-Hungary, where conditions may for the first time lie described5gs1- ?.b CSlav and Croat&apos; Socialists. Italian Wireless of May lltli reports: News lias arrived that even the Slav-Socialist Parties have adhered to the programme of the dugo-Slav National Union. The newspaper Agramer Taghlatt &quot;reports that the Slovene Socialists, at a conference held on May 1st at Lubiana, and also the Croat Socialists at Zagreb, demanded union with the dugo-Slavs. The official orator,. Deputy Kopac, said at Lubiana that for Socialists State union and. independence were a logical part of the popular aims, and as such coincided with the middle-class aims. If it. were needed to fight, for a Jugo-Slav State the democracy would be the first to do its duty.
as desperate ; (2) that the transport service should hy now be in a fairly efficient state ; (3) that the country is by no means pacified and the spring sowings are certain to be much below the ordinary level ; but that (1) enough will be obtained to keep the German bread ration up to its present level (about 4 lb. a week on an average) all next year, and quite probably extra stocks will&quot; be available to supply neutral countries. If this proves to be the case, the Allies will find themselves much handicapped in their commercial negotiations with the neutrals. Hitherto Germany&apos;s inability to supply Holland and Scandinavia with grain has been a decisive factor in favour of the Allies.&quot;Germany and the Jeios. Russian Wireless of May 11th records a protest by the Bolshevist Government against a raid made on May 1st by the Germans upon the Jewish Socialist Union at Minsk. In the course of the deflate on the Prussian Franchise Bill, the Conservative Deputy, I-Ieins, proposed, the disfranchisement of all peoples of &quot;alien race,&quot; and stated plainly that his proposal was directed against the Jews. Addressing the Liberals, he said: &quot;. Make this sacrifice ; sacrifice your Jews. Moltke said, that the Jews are a State within the State, and Maria Theresa expressed herself to the same effect,&quot;German Journalists for Russia. By Russian Wireless of May 10th, the Bolshevist Representative in Berlin is instructed to give German jourilalists permits for Russia subject to the consent of the Bolshevist Government in each individual case.German Financial Activities in Russia.. Mr. Wood house emphasises the importance of counteracting the strenuous financial activities of Germany in Russia. The Germans are at present endeavouring to secure control of all Russian metallurgical concerns. It is suggested that Great Britain should-retaliate by obtaining, through the purchase of Bank shares, control over coal, naphtha, timber, ores, water transport and insurance.Submarine Warfare.- In the course of a speech in the Reichstag, Admiral von Capelle is reported by German Wireless of May 11th as saying: &quot;As far as the requirements of the Army and. Navy, which cannot be refused, permit, our whole war industry will continue to be used for the building of submarines, and precautions will be taken to see that for years to come there shall be no slackening in the regular deliveries of new submarines.&quot; In this connection may be recalled the recent declaration of Count Westarp, that it would be desirable to have as many submarines as possible at the time of peace negotiations, and that the limitation of the German naval programme must not be discussed at such negotiations.Prussian Franchise. The rejection by the Lower House of the Prussian Diet of the clause in the Franchise Bill which confers equal suffrage is the most important event in Prussian internal politics for some time past. At present the Prussian electorate vote upon what is called the three-class system, which is regarded by Liberals as unfair and obsolete. A. political crisis may arise in Prussia if democratic feeling in favour of suffrage reform is as intense as has been alleged. The Liberal newspapers are already indignant at the rejection of the equal suffrage clause. There has been talk of the resignation of the Prussian Government or the dissolution of the Diet, though neither event is at all probable. The Bill as passed contains clauses for a secret ballot, and for making it obligatory on every elector to exercise his vote. The ultimate fate of the Bill, which has the support of Count von Hertling as Prussian Prime Minister, will test the sincerity of the Government in their support of franchise reform, as well as the power of the Prussian people to get their desired reforms. According to a telegram from Berlin to the Frankfurter Zeitung, it is positively assured in political circles that Count Hertling has received, authority from the Raiser to dissolve the Lower House of the Prussian Diet if the necessity should arise. It was left to the Ministry to decide when the dissolution should take place, and it is generally assumed that it will happen in the late summer or autumn, after the definite rejection of the franchise.Economic Reconstruction,-A telegram from Berlin (May 6th) states that in lectures given-by the Imperial Economic Department to representatives of the Press it was explained that organisation under State supervision for the transitional period after the conclusion of peace was considered necessary, especially with reference to
the rate of exchange, and. in view of the limited tonnage which would, be atltfej disposal, of Germany at the conclusion of the war. Such organisation was particularly necessary for the textile industry, and also for certain colonial products such as rubber, fats, oils, hides, and leather. Trade would not be excluded, from such organisations, and no formation of compulsory syndicates was intended. It was declared that the Imperial Economic Department did not share the optimistic opinion -prevailing in shipping circles regarding the position of tonnage at the end. of the Avar, ddie Bureau, which it was proposed to institute for the distribution of tonnage, was only to decide technical questions, and especially those concerning the preferential treatment of certain goods. With regard to textiles, the Imperial. Economic Depart-ment pointed out that there wasa decrease in production owing to the lack of raw materials and a considerable increase in spindles and looms, especially in the United States. Attention was also drawn to the reported purchase by Great Britain of the Egyptian cotton crop and the Australian wool crop for a number of years after the avar, ddie position of German industries was, nevertheless, described as &quot; not so exceedingly difficult, as substitutes which have been discovered in the course of the war are gaining greater importance from year to year.&quot; With reference to Colonial products, the Economic Department counts on an abundance, and the proposed organisation Avas intended to prevent the &apos; German markets from being inundated with such products and. to avoid any waste of tonnage. In a speech delivered in the Reichstag on the organisation, of the German trade offensive after the Avar, Professor SchuLe-G aver nit/, demands &quot;a judicious combina-tion of state socialism and private enterprise.&quot; &quot; Things will not lie able to go on altogether without State monopolies .... bow many small traders will be comiug back from the war Avhp will be quite incapable of resuming their business without some assignment of raw material. We must see to it that not only the big-trader, thanks to his war profits, gets hold of the raw materials, but that the small trader too receives his share, and this by the intervention of the State. . . . Some State authority must exist, but Ave cannot agree Avith the Socialists aviio would perpetuate what must be a transitory. regime. In order to raise the value of our securities a matter that concerns even the smallest among our people in order to replenish, our stock of raw materials, we must, since we can expect no considerable influx of foreign loans, promote our export trade. Immediately after the Avar we shall have to re-establish our export capacity on a higher level even than before the Avar, since we shall more than ever need imports. First and foremost the export of goods of high value must be promoted. The task of promoting exports is confronted with the menace of serious impediments. I do not attach tragic importance to the threatened economic Avar after the avar, ddie hunger for goods will overcome every other consideration ; goods will be bought wherever they are to be found. A. more serious danger, in my opinion, is the spirit of economic nationalism that has got abroad, especially in England. But graver still, in view of the universal demand, is the universal scarcity of raw materials, ddie Australian /due output has been bespoken by England for many years to come. Palm kernel oil, too, has been made more difficult for us to obtain. We have no choice therefore but to secure for ourselves considerable colonies capable of supplying us with raw materials. As an additional, expedient, we should conclude treaties providing for the supply of raw materials, on the model of the peace treaties with Rumania and with the Ukraine.&quot; But, in Professor von Schulze-Gavernitz&apos;s opinion, the surest method of working up a new world-connection is by means of the &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clause, imposed as in the case of the Treaty of Frankfurt with France in 187.1. Annexations may or may not be desirable, but from the point of view of Germany&apos;s future in the world it is absolutely essential that no nation should be given a preference over any other. &quot; That,&quot;&apos; he said, &quot; is the most important war-aim, not only for Germany, but for all nations interested in. world-economy. An equal place in the sun for everybody. But if Germany seeks equality of treatment, she must abandon the practice of &quot;dumpling,&quot; which was so bitterly resented abroad. It would be to our own interest if we took account of these sentiments and declared our readiness to reorganise an international authority that Avould be charged with securing the honest observance of the &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; rule. If to-day we declare for such a system, we thereby encourage, as a glance at the foreign. Labour Press shows, all those abroad who are in the economic bondage and whose hostility to a policy of exclusion makes them in the ultimate resort friends of peace. If we pursue this policy, then the triple tariff system goes by the board, and with it the. possibility  of
conciliating   our   allies hy means of  special preferences.    But  that  is   to  our interest.   We cannot ignore the fact that our enemies embrace nearly the whole world.   We cannot shut ourselves off.   The whole world must he told that Germany does not claim any trade preferences in Turkey, and that all she seeks there is the maintenance of her own position and equal rights for all nations. .... ..&quot;In conclusion, the Professor drew the following political moral, of the times :  &quot;In formulating these wishes we must also inspire ourselves with the spirit from which springs the demand for an equal franchise for all. Behind every exchange of goods lie moral, imponderahilia. No treaty of peace can guard us against the rejection of our wares, and this without any breach of the formal stipulation regarding equal rights. The cultivation, of sentiment is essential for.the reconstruction of a world-economy. We Germans can. best, promote the world-economic sentiment that we need by identifying our political activity more prominently with the progressive demoera-tisation of the classes which are less susceptible to international hatred. This we can most surely achieve by means of the so-called internal readjustment which is or ought now to be proceeding in Prussia. Nothing has so estranged the world from us as our system of government hitherto. Every business man who has lived abroad has learned for himself that in this system of government, lie rooted the want of sympathy and the mistrust which have confronted the German trader everywhere. There can be no doubt but that the readjustment now in progress, which ought to spread from Prussia over the whole of the German Empire, possesses great economic-importance, and that it is bound to make it easier for the German trader and for German goods to get back again, into the world.&quot; (The discussion is reported at length in the Times of May 13th.)German Trade Propaganda in Scandinavia.- The Berlin correspondent of Berlingshe Tidende wires to his paper (Apr. 26.in.) that the Deutsche Werhbnnd, (which last year exhibited in Switzerland), intends at the end of June to arrange exhibitions at Copenhagen and Stockholm, &quot; in order to show what Germany has achieved in the commercial and industrial spheres during the war.&quot;NEUTRAL GROUP.CHILE.Germany and the Chilean Military Mission.. The Foreign Office learns that the German Government has requested the Uruguayan Government to support its request that the Chilian Military Mission now in Spain, should visit the German front. Upon inquiry by the Uruguayan Government, the Chilian Government has stated that it does not desire the Mission to proceed to Germany.   (See also Report No. 56.)DENMARK.Elections. The election to the Upper House or Landsthing resulted, in the return of 2S supporters of the Government, namely, 13 Radicals and 15 Socialists : and of 44 supporters of the Opposition, namely, 26 Liberals and 18 Conservatives. The Government is thus in a minority of 16 in the Upper House. In the Lower House or Folke thing it has a majority of 3 (see Report No. 65). The result will not affect Danish foreign policy.Iceland. Sir R. Paget reports an announcement by the Danish Prime Minister that a conference of party leaders will be summoned to discuss the general question of relations between Denmark and Iceland, and to decide whether to endorse the policy adopted by the King and the State Council, of refusing to grant the Icelanders an independent commercial flag. It is stated that the King is unwilling to accede to the proposition that the union between Denmark and Iceland should be merely personal. A Danish Commission will shortly proceed to Iceland to confer on matters generally, and to offer assistance in the development of the country. There is reason to believe that British capital would be welcomed for the purposes of such development. With regard to the statements of the German propaganda that Great Britain has
been exerting pressure upon Iceland and inciting it to claim independence of Denmark (see Report No. 67), the Foreign Office informs Sir R. Paget that His Majesty&apos;s Government has issued a formal denial of the truth of these allegations.Supply.7*7/ Germany of Shipbuilding Material. Sir II. Paget reports that Germany appears to he deliberately delaying consignments of shipbuilding materials to Danish, shipyards. It seems also that vessels being built of materials to be delivered under recent negotiations will only be permitted to trade with Germany, Finland, or Russia, or in the Danish coasting trade for the duration of tlie war.FINLAND and ALAND.Recognition. Sir L. Howard reports that His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Helsingfors has communicated to the Finnish Foreign Minister the conditions offered by His Majesty&apos;s Government for recognition of Finland, and that the Finnish Press has been referred to the Minister for the particulars ; the Swedish Press of May 13th publish the terms of the offer (and see Reports Nos. Gi-66).German Policy in Finland. According to German Wireless  of May 8th, Vice-Chan eel lor von Payer, in the course of a speech made on May 7th in the Reichstag, declared that German intervention in Finland  was not concerned -with Finnish domestic affairs, but with a fight against Russia, who, with the assistance of Finnish anarchists, was endeavouring to rob  Finland of her liberty.    German  Wireless reports that President Swinhufvud has conferred upon Rear Admiral. Meurer  the Finnish Cross of Freedom of the First Class, &quot; for the participation of the German Fleet in this work of liberation.&quot; ...&quot; flow her future development will, turn out is purely a Finnish affair.   Our only desire was to accpiire political and military security in Finland and peace on the Baltic. . . . We have concluded treaties with Finland which are in accordance with well-understood interests of both sides, and which will contribute to the strengthening of the mutual relations between Germany and Finland, economic and political.   By the liberation of Finland we believe that we have also rendered a considerable service to Sweden by the creation, of a protective wall in the Last.&quot;   On. the same date the Berlin correspondent of the Rheiniseh-Westfdlische Zeitung (May 7th) says : &quot; There can no longer be any doubt that the idea of Finland becoming a Kingdom prevails in Berlin, and that negotiations have been begun with Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg regarding his acceptance of the Finnish Crown (see Report No. 67).   In well-informed circles in Berlin it is said that Ids candidature would meet with no opposition from Sweden or Denmark.   The connection of Germany with Finland is likely to be of a military and economic nature.   The desire in Berlin is for a relationship similar to that existing between Germany, and Turkey and Bulgaria respectively, except that the economic relations with Finland would be closer.&quot;  (According to a Press telegram from Stockholm it has been decided not to have a general election in Finland, but to let the present Diet, which is to meet on May .15th, settle the future form of constitution.   The Swedish portion of the Finnish Press considers a monarchy most probable, while the Finnish newspapers expect a decision in favour of a Republic.   About SO members are absent, being either fugitives or prisoners.)German Exploitation of Finland. According to reports in the Norwegian Press, the Finnish Senate has confiscated all goods for German account, and the Germans intend to regulate prices. The goods seized include large stocks of timber and great stores of ammunition stored in various parts of Finland by the Russians. Sir E. Howard reports that the Finnish Government has undertaken to pay for the German expedition. According to a report from Stockholm the Germans will lie partly compensated by a preferential tariff. The Christiania Morgenblad learns from Stockholm that the Germans have induced the Finnish authorities to discourage the return to Finland of Swedish residents, in order that German business men and commercial travellers may monopolise trade. Mr. Grove reports the cop elusion and partial publication of a Commercial Treaty between Finland and. Germany; to this and to the general pro-German policy of the Government, Finnish business circles are showing violent opposition, as being likely to lead to the ruin of the country.
German-Finnish Sea Trade. German. Wireless of May 9th reports : &quot; In the evening of May 7th the first commercial steamer from Finland (Abo), called the Goele Trader, arrived in the harbour of Luebeck, flying the Finnish Bag, in order to take in a cargo for Finland. Direct communication with Finland has thus been resumed. The warehouses on the.quay and the commercial buildings were decorated with, flags in celebration of the occasion.&quot;Russian Karelia,  Sir E. Howard, is informed that, while the Finnish Government is probably prepared to incorporate Eastern Karelia upon request by the inhabitants, it has abandoned the idea of Conquering it. This may be clue, first, to British warnings, secondly to the magnitude of the project, and thirdly to fact that the population, being of the Orthodox Church, might be difficult to assimilate. There is a further possible reason in the apprehension of Swedish Finns that they may be swamped by an accretion of pure Finns. Such an anticipation is illustrated by their reported movement for the adoption of a cantonal system in Finland. A report from Helsingfors to the Svenska Dagbladet (pro-German) states that &quot; Finland will not at present take -any action for the conquest of Russian Karelia as Germany will not support any such enterprise. Measures are, however, being taken to ascertain the popular wishes in the province, and it is presumed that in the case of a plebiscite demanding union with Finland the Germans will support this claim.&quot; Meanwhile, according to an annouuce-ment in the Swedish Press of May 12-th, the Finnish Whites have taken Boris Gleb, in Russia, near Varanger Fjord, and. have declared it to bo Finnish territory. They have requested the inhabitants to leave. In this connection the projected Germ an-Finnish march on petshenga (see Report No. 07) is of interest, particularly in view of rumours current in Norway that German, submarines are going, to Betschenga fiord. Slock holms Dagblad of May 10th states that the Finnish White Volunteers operating in Eastern Karelia have already had several skirmishes with strong Russian &quot;and. English&quot; forces and Finnish Reds, and that on May 9th they captured Kem &quot; although the Reds were, supported by 1,500 Englishmen just arrived with 10 armoured.cars.&quot;Germany and Finnish Ports. The Foreign Office learns of a report that the Finnish Government is negotiating a treaty for leasing Finnish ports to Germany for three years.Finnish Relations with the Allies. The Finnish Foreign Minister, Senator Ren vail, in an interview reported in. Svenska Dagbladet, after emphasising that German help had been sent unconditionally and simply as a consequence of the Brest Treaty, declared that the relations of Finland with England were purely official. He observed that the continuation of new demands on the part of England had. complicated the settlement of food supply, adding that the English were nervous regarding Finnish relations with Germany, and. also regarding the Murman Railway. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, General Mannerheim has threatened to resign owing to his disapproval of the present pro-German policy of the Finnish Government ; the Government itself is stated to be. alarmed at the situation and to contemplate resignation. It is thought possible that General Mannerheim may be appointed dictator. Meanwhile the Finnish Government has instructed him to endeavour to regain the authority usurped by the Germans, and to afford all possible assistance and protection to allied subjects ; it seems clearly anxious not to be forced into a rupture of relations with the Allied Powers.Arrest of British Subjects in Finland. The Foreign Office is informed that a British officer, arrested by the Germans in Finland, is not receiving recognition and treatment as such. Sir E. Howard is instructed to call the attention of the Finnish Government, to this aggravation of the outrage already committed (see Reports Nos. 60 and 62) and to press for the release of all the British subjects so arrested.Germans and. Finnish Red Prisoners. With reference to the statement (mentioned in Report No. 67) that Red prisoners were to be deported to Germany as a labour contingent, Sir E. Howard learns that, though the question is under consideration, no decision has yet been reached.Bolshevist Statement as to Excesses by White Troops. Russian Wireless of&quot; May 13th contains statements by &quot;the Bolshevist Government of mass executions by the White Guards, &quot;Allies of the German authorities.&quot;
Aland: Negotiations for Demolition of Fortifications. The Swedish Press of May 8th publishes the following official communique: &quot;The Governments of Sweden, Germany, and Finland have decided to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty regarding the demolition of all fortified, works on the Aland Islands which have been, constructed during the war contrary to international conventions.&quot;Finland and the Swedish. Expedition to Aland. In an interview reproduced in the Svehska Daghladet, the Finnish Foreign Minister, Senator Pen vail, has stated that he quite realised that the Swedish expedition to Aland, was despatched with a humanitarian aim. Since it had been withdrawn at the request of the Finnish Government it had. been possible to preserve good relations with Sweden, particularly ., since Vvestman had. become Swedehs representative in Finland.Reported Conscription of Alanders. Swedish newspapers (May 8th) report from the Aland Islands that the Governor, Bonsdorff, has issued, a proclamation summoning all able-bodied men between the ages of 21 and 1.0 to enlist.MEXICO.Puerto Mexico.  Mr. Cummins reports that Puerto Mexico is threatened by rebels, that foreigners are in danger and that the refinery needs protection. The Mexican Government has requested the Eagle Oil Company to provide vessels, if necessary, for the removal of Government personnel and property.Guaymas. Mr. Cummins reports that the Mexican Government has withdrawn the exequaturs of the British Vice-Consul, and the United States Consular Officer at Guaymas.   Their reinstatement lias been demanded.NETHERLANDS.Netherlands and Germany. Sir W. Townley reports that no definite agreement has yet been drawn up between the German and Netherlands Governments on the matters under recent discussion (see Reports Nos. 06 and 67). The Netherlands Foreign Minister, replying to an interpellation in the Second Chamber, has stated that the reasons -which had caused the Government to regard relations with Germany as strained consisted in the emphasis with which the German Government notified what they desired the Netherlands Government to grant, such demands immediatelyappearing to be in part unacceptable.....It was plainly stated that non-compliancewould have highly grave consequences for the Netherlands. The Minister then explained, the stipulations upon which the Netherlands Government had insisted, adding that the Associated. Governments had shown that they fully understood the gravity of the situation in- which that Government was placed, and that through their representatives they had informed him that solely ou that account, but otherwise maintaining intact their standpoint of principle, they would raise no difficulties with regard to the arrangement concluded. Tyd and the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Gouranb of May 6th, and. Ilandelshlad of May 7th, enquire as to the nature of the threats used by Germany, and intimate distrust of: German methods. Sir W. Townley has pointed out to the Netherlands Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government would he obliged to protest against any transit over the Limburg Railway of ore or timber clearly intended for military purposes.NICARAGUA.Reported Declaration of VFdr*oji Germany. A. message from San Juan del Sur (May 7th) states : &quot; Nicaragua has declared war on Germany and. her Allies. Congress adopted the declaration of war at President Chamorro&apos;s suggestion with only four negative votes, as well as a declaration of solidarity with the United States and the other American republics at war with Germany and Austria, and authorised the President to utilise the natioiPs forces to the full measure.&quot; (This report is not yet officially confirmed. Nicaragua broke off diplomatic relations with Germany on May 1.9th, 1.917.) German Wireless of May 11th takes the opportunity to impute this declaration to the economic dependence of Nicaragua upon the United States. (See also under i: Guatemala.&quot;)
NORWAY.Norwegian-American Agreement.  The new Economic Agreement between Norway and the United States (dating from May 10th) provides for (1) supply to Norway, under certain conditions, of fixed annual quantities of specified commodities ; (2) facilities for ships carrying the approved cargoes ; (3) limitations on re-export from Norway; (4) non-interference with imports for use in factories working for Allies ; (5) facilita-tion of certain exports to the Allies ;. (6) control of Norwegian imports by certain Trade Associations under agreements with the Allies (for particulars see Memorandum G.T. 4496). Various questions of interpretation are under consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Meanwhile, Lord Reading reports that licences are being-granted for export of goods urgently required, in cases where such,goods are covered by existing agreements.British, Freights.  Sir M. Find lay reports that the Norwegian. Government is anxious for an immediate reduction of coal, freights to Norway, and of paper and pulp freights to British ports. Sir M. Findlay has pointed out the objections in each case, but enquires whether His Majesty&apos;s Government is able to offer any relief in respect of homeward freights.Transit Goods. The question of the disposal of transit goods now in Norway (see Report No. 66 under &quot;Sweden &quot;) is being dealt with by the Allied Blockade Coni-mittee acting in conjunction with the Interallied Trade Committee at Christiania.SPAIN.Coal Freights la Spain. The question of coal freights to Spain as affecting the supply of. Spanish minerals (see Memorandum G.T. .3501, Report No. 56 under. &quot;Shipping Situation,&quot; and Report No. 57 under &quot;Spain &quot;), is further discussed in a Memorandum G.T. 4526, dated May 10th.The New Cabinet and the Juntas. Sr. Maura, in his speech concluding the debate on the Speech from, the Throne, definitely stated that should there be a. recurrence of the- Junta movement it would be ruthlessly suppressed. This pronouncement is hailed with satisfaction by a section of the Press, including the Republican Pals. The papers of the extreme Right, e.g., Gorrco Dspunol, preach defiance, and the organ of the Juntas, Correspond end a lYlililar, is inclined, to take up the challenge, as, according to reports from Barcelona, are the Juntas themselves, ddie return to Madrid of Sr. La Cierva is held to be significant.   [DM. (F.P.S.) of May 10th.]German Intrigues. The Daily Review reports as follows regarding German intrigues in Spain :  &quot; (a) Making Miscliiej n:\tii the United States.&quot; ddie Mundo (April 27th) reverts to the reports circulated by German propaganda that Spanish ships are being kept in port through fear of being requisitioned by the United States. According to Spanish passengers recently arrived from New York, these assertions are not without effect on Spanish-American relations, and now occupy the attention of the New York Press. The latter blames Spanish shipowners for tying up their ships under German threats, and hints that this conduct may ultimately check the dispatch of cotton, oil, and other commodities from the United States to Spain under the recent treaty. It indignantly repudiates the suggestion that the United States Government harbours any designs on Spanish ships. The irritation produced abroad, by these intrigues, continues the Mundo, constitutes a grave danger for Spaiu, and while Spanish, representatives in the United States are doing their utmost to obtain export licences, facilities, and concessions for Spanish producers, in Spain itself impudent slanders are being,.circulated for the purpose of favouring Germany and injuring the United States. It is an. act of criminal folly to create this atmosphere of hostility towards Spain, which may seriously affect her interests. We do not address this appeal to the pro-Germans, Their intention has long been clear, viz., to embroil Spain with allied countries, so that the hitter may be goaded into adopting measures in self-defence which will immediately be seized upon as signs of ill-will calling for retaliation. This has, fortunately, not so far been the case, but it must be remembered that public opinion is easily inflammable, and Governments of countries like the United States are apt to be guided by it.&quot;
&quot; (b) Manipulation of the Exchange.&quot;The Puhlicldad makes the following further statement regarding the operations of pro-German agents on the Barcelona Stock Exchange : &quot; Whenever, owing to the necessities of the market, the exchange shows an upward tendency in favour of francs and pounds, one of these agents sells at a low price millions of francs, which he does not deliver, settling his account through certain banks in a manner best known to themselves. Unfortunately the Stock Exchange Committee uses these sales, of. the real significance of which it is ignorant, as a basis for quotations. Thus are achieved the depreciation of the franc and a moral effect prejudicial to the Allies. As a complement of this manoeuvre marks are quoted at a fancy price, some 25 pesetas above their real value.&quot; (c) Support of Syndicalists.&quot; Commenting on current rumours of a general strike at Barcelona originating in strikes in several, iron foundries, Correspondencla de Espana (April 26th) notes that for some time past Catalan syndicalism has been suspiciously active. It sees at the bottom of this ostensibly Labour movement a well-defined political purpose, and finds that all the appearances point to the intention of paralysing work in factories with an object which, if not apparent, can be guessed.&quot; The Correspondencla points out that the Allies have no interest in disorganising Spanish industries, as they have shown by the facilities which they have afforded for the import of coal and raw materiaf into the country. This interest must be sought in another direction, and a precedent found in the dislocation of the economic existence of the nation wrought by the submarine blockade to which it is subjected. &apos; This object may be completed by the stoppage of work in factories and workshops.&quot; [The alliance of the Barcelona Syndicalists and German agents was dealt with at length by Espana of March 7th.] The latest news from Barcelona does nothing for allay these suspicions. The SoVs correspondent in that city insists daily on the imminence of fresh strikes. Disorders are feared which may compel a return to martial law. Rumours of threatened strikes also come from the mining districts of Peharroya, Rio TintO, and Thafsis [the last two are owned by British Companies, and all supply the Allies with ore]. A secret propaganda is being carried on in these districts by agents who are not always workmen.   [Sol, May 1st.;&quot;Requisitioning of Spanish Merchant Fleet. The newspapers (May 8th) announce that a decree providing for the requisitioning of the entire merchant fleet of Spain will be promulgated immediately. Meanwhile the Food Bureau has opened an inquiry with the object of affording to shipowners an opportunity to submit their views in regard to this step. Simultaneously with&apos;the requisitioning order a Council of Administration, possessing the functions of a Board of Control, will be established on which shipowners themselves will be dub&apos; represented.Amnesty Bill: Release of Strike Committee. Madrid telegrams of May 9th and 10th announce the release of the members of the Strike Committee from prison at Carthagena under the Amnesty Bill. A large crowd, which included many members of various labour organisations and Socialist and Republican societies, met the released men at the prison gates and gave them an enthusiastic reception. Throughout their journey to Madrid the men were greeted by numerous deputations of workers, and the railway carriage in which they travelled arrived in the capital covered with flowers. On leaving the train the Strike Committee was enthusiastically cheered by a large crowd, consisting chiefly of workmen, Avhich thronged the approaches to the station. The released men drove to the PeophPs Palace amid a continuous ovation. Republican Deputies, presidents of workmeAs societies, -womeAs delegations, and workers&apos; syndicates accompanied, the carriages, which had difficulty in forcing a passage through the immense crowd. The released men appeared on the balcony of the People&apos;s Palace, and amidst enthusiastic cheers made speeches reiterating their determination to work for the liberation of the labouring classes. The crowd then dispersed without further incidents.League of Blacklisted Firms. Dla of April 26th reports : &quot; A League has been formed of the &apos; victims &apos; of the Allies&apos; black lists.   It will issue a. bulletin or report5681-31) &apos; ,E
which will publish a list of the acts of &apos; oppression &apos; perpetrated by the Allies on Spanish trade, the names of the firms which have been victimised, so that they may co-operate for mutual defence, the cases of oppression to which they have been subjected; and the names of traders or firms refusing to co-operate with the victims of the black lists, with an indication against the name of each of the form of reprisal which they deserve,&quot;SWEDEN.Swedish Negotiations with the Allies. In view of the reduction of tonnage charter-able to the Allies to -100,000 tons (of which 100,000 appear so far not to be available), and of the fact that Germany insists upon increased exports of pyrites, ferro-silicon and wood pulp, Sir E. Howard is now doubtful of the advantage of an immediate general agreement, and suggests the advisability of a series of minor agreements applying respectively to tonnage (on the lines of the modus vivendi), and, when possible, to restriction of exports to Germany. Such an arrangement would probably suffice to secure the position of the present Swedish Government, and later military and economic developments may very possibly conduce to its acceptance of a general agreement on terms more satisfactory to the Allies (and see Report No. 65).Carbide. The Minister of Agriculture on May 10th stated in the Riksdag that the annual output of carbide in Sweden was about 51,000 tons, of which 21,000 tons were consumed for manufacture of cyanamide and yielded about 28,000 tons. The consmnption of carbide in Sweden and the export in 1918 and 1919 were estimated at 34,700 tons. In order to meet the shortage, the Industrial Commission would endeavour to increase the present output of carbide by about 10,000 tons.SWITZERLAND././ydro-electrical Energy.- Sir H. Rumbold reports that a decree was issued on May 8th by the Federal Council placing under strict control as from May 15th the exportation of hydro-electrical energy. The issue of licences will in future be limited in accordance with Swiss home requirements, and licences are made subject to with-drawal without compensation if their conditions are not fulfilled. Foreign consumers are to defray part costs of administration. By this measure the hands of the Council will be greatly strengthened for their negotiations with the Germans who have been increasingly offensive of late.   (See Report No. 67.)Purchases of Allied Notes. With reference to the recent large purchases on the Continent of Allied banknotes (see Reports Nos. 60, 62-65 and 67 under &quot; Netherlands,&quot; &quot;Norway&quot; or &quot; Switzerland&quot;) Sir II. Rumbold now reports as follows : The total trans-actions in British notes throughout Switzerland amounted, at the end. of the first week of Ahvy to about I20,000L It is stated that purchases have been officially made on behalf of Bulgaria, and that Jews from Galicia and the East are also buying with Swiss notes obtained by the sale of marks and crowns. It is further reported that some 10,000,000 francs&apos; worth of British, French and American notes recently bought by Bulgarian agents were, in fact, destined ultimately for Constantinople. The majority of French notes are being held in Switzerland in expectation of peace. Italian notes, required by the Turkish Government for payment of Italian workmen and by the Austrians for use in occupied Italian territory, are selling at five to six francs above cheque rate.Supply and Transport of Grain. The Foreign Office learns that, according to the Swiss Minister at Washington, Switzerland still requires 36,000 tons of bread cereals before the end of June. The Swiss Government is stated to be again negotiating for the purchase or charter of enemy vessels in Spanish waters, and has also opened negotiations for charteriug certain Dutch vessels now in Dutch ports : with regard to the former, the enemy owners are stipulating, first, for the right to re-acquire the vessels after the conclusion of peace, and, secondly, that the Allies shall undertake not to seize or requisition them during the war, and that the return voyages shall be
18 &apos;    187made in ballast. Meanwhile the United States Minister lias handed, to the Swiss Political Department the following memorandum (dated May 6th) based upon instruc-tions from the State Department, constituting, in effect, a reply to the German conditions mentioned in Report No. 6,6 : -&quot; The rumour that no cargo of wheat would be sent from, the United. States for the next three.months is.absolutely without foundation. It is true that a seini-official declaration was made by Germany (Dr. Sulzer, the Swiss Minister at Washington, confirmed this declaration verbally to the State Department) saying that the safe conduct granted.by her to American ships laden with corn for Switzerland would only enter into force at the end of three months and that this lapse of time would, be necessary in order to modify the orders given to commanders of submarines by which American ships carrying corn for Switzerland must be torpedoed. This is tantamount to a declaration by Germany that she maintains the armed blockade of Switzerland and that American corn on American ships already promised to Switzer-land cannot be delivered unless these ships are in a position to open the way which is blocked by Germany by fighting. This also renders illusory the supposed free passage to the port of Gette. The United States Government is ready to accept tlie challenge, and two ships flying the American flag are now en route for a French Atlantic port laden with corn for Switzerland and escorted by American warships. In addition to this measure of assistance which the United States Government is aide to grant to the Swiss Government by sending warships to accompany corn ships in order to assure to Switzerland the receipt of her grain supplies by arniecl force, it is always possible that Switzerland may receive grain on neutral vessels, although this possibility is much diminished since a German submarine torpedoed tlie Spanish steamer Sardinero, which was carrying grain for Switzerland, although she was not in the barred zone. The steps taken by the United. States Government ought to be a sufficient guarantee of the intention of this Government to assure to Switzerland the delivery of grain. It may be recalled&apos; that the extraordinary efforts which the American Government is making and will continue to make will result in a further diminution of the corn rations allowed to the American people. The exportation^ already made to neutral, and allied countries have reduced, the rations at home to such a point that the consumption of grain per head In Switzerland is now considerably greater than the average consumption, of grain per head, in the United States.&quot;Interned Conditions : lire Milk Question. The compromise with regard to the milk price, namely, that of the 7 centimes increase per litre, 8 should lie paid by the consumer, 3 by the Confederation, and I by the cantons, which was unanimously agreed to by the States Council, has now also been accepted by the National Council, on the understanding that the limits of the maximum income entitling persons to purchase milk at 27 centimes shall be exteuded (Der Bund, April. 26th). According to a report received, the number of persons benefiting by this arrangement is increased from 300,000 to 1,000,000.   (See Report No. 67.)Government Control of Foods, Fats, and Metals. The Swiss Government intends to take over the purchase and distribution of foodstuffs, industrial fats and metals imported- into Switzerland from abroad, and has already made preliminary arrange-in en ts for centralising the control of fats and foodstuffs. It is understood that the Federal Authorities will act in close co-operation with the S.S.S.URUGUAY.Uruguay and Germany. Mr. Mitchell Innes reports that in reply to the enquiry of the Uruguayan Government (see Reports Nos. 63 and 65), the German Government has stated that it does not consider Germany and Uruguay as being in a state of war. (See also under &quot; Chile.&quot;)PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. Contrary to expectations in last weelds Report, the escape of Russian Black Sea Avar vessels to Novorossisk still keeps this subject within the scope of &quot;peace discussions.&quot;5081-31&apos; V
The- aftermath of the Brest treat)- is of interest, and Russian Wireless is beginning to disclose the terms of some additional provisos affecting economics, probable indemnities disguised under the title of war damages, &amp;o, appended by the Germans to the treaty, Additional provisos, to which great importance is attached by the Allied &quot;Ministers at Jassy, have been appended to the published treaty signed with Rumania at Bucharest on &quot;May 7th. There is uneasiness in. Finland about a similar German policy disclosed in supplementary agreements appended to their peace treaty.Russia. Russian Wireless of May 9th-10th announced the acceptance of the German proposals for peace negotiations with the Ukraine to be held at Kieff, and published a manifesto, signed by Trotsky and members] of the Council, to the.effect that the Russian Government&apos; has commenced peace negotiations with the Ukraine in accordance with the Brest Peace Treaty. A line of defensive guards, who will not permit any armed detachments to enter Russian territory, has been established on all fronts. These defensive guards were directed to disarm all detachments which may cross the Ukrainian frontier, using relentless force if necessary. (Mr. Wardrop on May 8th reported the conclusion, at Koienevo of an armistice on the Kursk front, and steps being taken to extend the armistice to other fronts. On May 9th he reported the signature on May 7th of truces on Bryans, Voronezh, Bielgorod fronts.) (Sec also under Ukraine.)Russian Wireless of May Pith published a message from Chicherin to Joffe at Berlin; directing him to inform the German Government, that part of the Russian Black Sea Fleet had left Sebastopol and is now at Novorossisk. Count Mirbach &quot; declared to us that the danger of being attacked by our warships is of such nature as to impress upon the German military authorities the necessity of capturing Novorossisk.&quot; Chicherin informs Joffe of a reply given to Count Mirbach, completely contravening German, allegations. Russian Wireless of May 12th published a message received from the Commander-in-Chie  of the German troops in the East refusing to cease naval operations against the Russian Black Sea Fleet unless all the ships return to the Port of Sebastopol where they must be retained. If these demands were not complied with, the German Commander on the Eastern front threatened to continue offensive operations along the Black Sea coast against the ships of the Black Sea Fleet if they left Sebastopol. (In this message the Germans for the first time confessed that their operations, in contravention of the Brest Treaty and the Treaties of the Ukraine, were undertaken in order to get hold of the Russian war vessels.) On May 13th Russian Wireless published a manifesto stating that measures had been taken to prevent all hostile action by the Black Sea war vessels, offering as a guarantee their disarmament or internment at Novorossisk, or even their return to Sebastopol, subject to conditions which are worded; so as to test whether tire Germans really intend to be bound in any way by the Brest-Treaty.Ou May 9th Russian Wireless published a message from Chicherin to Joffe in Berlin begging (sic) the German Government immediately to appoint their delegates for the &quot; Mixed. Economic Commission,&quot; and insisting (sic) that Moscow shall be the place of meeting.On May 13th Russian Wireless published an announcement that, in accordance with the Brest Treaty, a commission would soon be formed to examine claims of damage done, under military law, &quot; by citizens of the Russian Republic to citizens and institutions of Powers which have been in a state of war with Russia.&quot;Lithuania. German AVireless of May 13th announced that the Imperial, documents of. recognition of an independent Lithuania, &quot; which is joined to the German Empire by a permanent alliance,&quot; containing also the. conventions with regard to military, monetary, and customs matters, were handed over by the. Chief of the Military Administration in Lithuania to (?) &quot;at the Presidency of the Lithuanian Lanclesrat &quot; at Kovno on May 4th. [This confirms former reports that recognition of &quot; inde-pendence &quot; (?) would only be conditional upon the complete subservience of Lithuania to German domination.]On May 8th Lord Reading reported the action of 700,000 Lithuanians in America demanding the real, independence of their country, ami the sympathy of President Wilson with their aspirations.Poland. -On &quot;May 13th Sir II. Rumbold reported that the actual text of the secret treaty, said to have been arranged between Russia and Germany at Brest (see Reports Nos. Ou and 67), has now been published in the Lausanne Gazette.
plans. A*s matters now stand, there is not the slightest disposition to question the &quot;motives that impel the two Eastern nations to join hands and protect themselves from any danger which they may foresee.&quot;Enemy Aliens: German propaganda and Japan: German protest: Vatican&apos;s anxiety.  German Wireless of May 19th states : &quot; The Frankfurter Zeitung contains a very remarkable article from Bale on the question of &apos; Germany and Japan,&apos; in which the alleged participation of Japan in the projected deportation of Germans from China is strongly assailed. . . . Germany, it is stated, does not absolutely require Japanese help in future, but Japan, nevertheless, needs the sympathy of Germany. As regards Germano-Japanese relations, there should be a talk between the respective peoples. Japan. however, is&quot; completely subjected, to the despotism of the English censorship, and does nothing in order that she may learn what is the feeling in Germany. It is urgently to be hoped that the Statesmen in Tokio will not sacrifice the future to the present.&quot;Count de Salis reports that the Vatican, learning of the prospective deportation from China of enemy subjects including women and children, and of a German threat of reprisals, has desired him to convey to His Majesty&apos;s Government an expression of its anxiety in the matter. (A German threat of retaliation has in fact been received through the Swiss authorities, and the Foreign Office has invited the views of the Allied Governments as to concerted action, pointing out that, since the proposed deportation is not shown to &quot;be contrary to international law, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is contenting itself with a formal acknowledgment of the German note.)CUBA.lied Gross Contributions. Mr. Leech reports the signature by the President of the Cuban Republic, of a Bill authorising an annual expenditure of 000,000 dollars upon Cuban Red Cross work in Europe, and of 2,400,000 dollars for the benefit of: civilians living in the war zone, and relatives of soldiers killed, and those incapacitated.FRANCE.French Public Opinion. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4551) dated May 11th the Political Intelligence Department exainhies the present state of public opinion in France, noticing that recent events have further consolidated the position of M. Clemenceau, whose popularity with the army and the people is admitted by his strongest opponents. &quot; There have been other good signs not connected with M. Clemenceau personally, ddie abandonment by the workmen of. the usual May Day celebrations, the immediate acceptance by all parties, including the Socialists, of the incorporation of Class 19 in the Army ; the admission by even the Extreme Left that &apos; before the over-ruling will of facts&apos; there can be no longer any parties in France ; the confessions of Socialist papers that no further trust can be put in German Socialists ; the widespread protests which from all quarters compelled the withdrawal of the amazing proposal to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Karl Marx; and, finally, the abandonment in the Chamber of the proposal to demand the com muni-cation of the Austrian documents to the whole House, and the frank expressions of confidence in the Government with which M. Forgeot, who had proposed this plan, accompanied its withdrawal; all these things together point to the healthiness of public opinion, and its increased determination in view of the German offensive, to do nothing to embarrass M. Clemenceau. Recognition of the military and economic efforts of Great Britain is also apparent. (Lord Derby reports that there wdll be a great manifestation in Paris on May 24th in honour of Great Britain; and that M. Deschenal, President of the Chamber, wdll deliver a speech recording the services of the British Empire during the war.)&quot; Bonnet Rouge &quot; Case. The trial of Duval and the other prisoners connected with the newspaper &quot; Bonnet Rouge,&quot; ended on May 15th. Duval, one of the managers of the paper, was charged with receiving the sum of 40,0O0Z. from a Mannheim banker for the purpose of conducting a defaitiste press campaign, ddie paper used all its resources to encourage class strife and to belittle the efforts of the Allies of France. Duval was sentenced to death. Among the other prisoners, all of whom received sentences varying from ten to two years&apos; imprisonment, was Leyniarie, formerly Chef de Cabinet to M. Malvy, who was at that time Minister of the Interior. In a memorandum-randum (G.T. 4584, dated May 16th), the Political Department discusses various
Ukraine. (See under Russia.) Mr. Wardrop on April 29th (received May 13t.li) reported, the suspension by the Germans oil lighting in the Kursk region for the meeting of the kusso-Ukrainian peace delegates. On May 10th he reported the -departure of the Ukrainian delegates from Vorozhba for Kieff, and quoted a Press telegram from Vorozhba, dated May 9th, saying that the Ukraine, was &quot;about to declare war (upon) Muscovy.&quot; (If true, an interesting development of the German interpretation of the preamble to the Brest Treaty, now that a pro-German military dictatorship has been substituted for the Ukrainian. Government with, which the Germans made &quot; peace.&quot;) On. May .17th Mr. Wardrop, on the authority of the Moscow Official Gazette, reported an. armistice on the whole Ukrainian front, and German Wireless of May 14th reported the agreement of the Ukrainian Government to enter into peace negotiations with the Russian Government at Kiel!&apos;.Rumania.......The peace treaty with the Central Powers was signed at Bucharest at11 a.m. on May 7th (German Wireless of May 8th). According to German Wireless of May 9th the treaty also includes &quot; the legal-political and trade-political suppler mentary treaties.&quot; Lord Derby on. May 1.1th sent on. a report from the Allied Ministers at Jassy attaching great importance to these subsidiary treaties. (The text, of the main treaty was published in the Times of May 9th see Report No. (57, page 19. s It is now clear that the Germans have appended other conditions, not yet published, as they did at Brest-Litovsk.) On May .1.3th Sir C. des Graz reported that the Rumanian Minister had informed the Serbian Government of the signature of peace, and had added that Rumania will henceforth observe strict neutrality towards all belligerents. German Wireless on May 11th alleged that the Rumanian Press expressed its satisfaction at the peace which has been, reached. The following extract, from the Leipziger V olkszcitung (May 8th) represents the situation with candour : &quot; Altogether this treaty is no peace of understanding, but-a pure mailed-fist peace. It contains open annexations and concealed war indemnities which, it is true, need not be paid in gold, but in economic promises which are no less burdening for Rumania than if a money indemnity had been imposed.&quot;   (D.R.F.P., May .14th.)France. On May 9th, Lord Derby reported the finding of the Foreign Affairs Commission that the peace conversations engaged and followed up by Austria-Hungary in 1917 and 191.8 &quot;did not at any moment give an opportunity for peace acceptable to France and her Allies.&quot;Italy. The Political Intelligence Department on May 7th reported a statement by Baron Sonnino on the Czernin Clemenceau controversy. After explaining the procedure at the Conference of St. Jean de Maurienne of April 19th, 1917, he added, &quot; the Italian Government has never on its own account, whether as invited or inviter, or indirectly by means of intermediaries, taken any part in any similar rapprochement with the enemy.&quot;Germany. German Wireless of May 10th announced the agreements about the -war prisoners and civilians, concluded between German and. French delegates on April 26th on the basis of the Berne Convention, had been approved by the two Governments, and would come into force on May 15th.The Foreign Office has received from a reliable source (May 9th) - information about a telegram, believed to be officially inspired, by Germany for insertion in the Press of neutral countries, containing the following passage: &quot;The lack of co-operation on the part of Austrians is so incomprehensible from a military point of view, that one cannot but be convinced that it is caused by International Catholic Press Agency. Kaiser Karl ought at this moment to stand shoulder to shoulder with his Allies in fight, and should show his friendship in Italy. But it is possible that friendship of Hapsburg (? Monarchy) with prominent, persons in Italy constitutes a friendly alliance, which is a disgrace. It is certain that passive hanging back of Austrians enables Allies to maintain very considerable, reserves.&quot;Further confirmation has Been received (Sir H. Rum bold, May 12th) of a carefully concealed German movement towards peace overtures, or the creation of a peace atmosphere in hostile countries.The Daily Review of the Foreign Press drew attention (May 9th) to an article by Bern hard Pin the Vossische Zeitmig of April 22ud, containing the words &quot;a complete
severance of France and England is the first step, in order to form a&apos; European block against England, who would be compelled to remain quiescent; peaceful intercourse may be generally desired by Germany, but can never be attained by illusory treaties, but only by force.&quot;Sir 11. Rum bold on May 2nd (received May 9th) confirmed on good authority former reports of friction between Turkey and Germany, and that the Turks are convinced that Germany means to establish a German Colony in the Crimea.On May 9th the Political Intelligence Department printed an important; paper on German war aims, showing that the treatment of the question of annexations is a barometer of the opinion in authoritative quarters on the prospects of complete military success. Evidence is given of frank confession that there is now no majority in the Reichstag against annexations and indemnities. Questions of Belgium, Loiigwy, Briey, Livonia, Esthonia, Courland, and Qesel are dealt with in detail.An armistice, the effect of which will lie to prevent the possibility of the war being continued, is represented by the Poliliken, on fairly reliable authority, as the result expected by the Germans if their dual offensive enables them to reach the French Channel ports.   (Sir R. Paget, May .14th.)German Wireless continues to gloat upon the word &quot; booty,&quot; and Press reports have been received from Norway of plunder (old furniture), stolen by the Germans from Belgium and Northern France, being advertised for sale in that country. (D.R.F.P.)According to an important report from Sir II. Rum bold (May Nth), based on reliable authority, Germain7 intends ultimately to go in openly for a policy of annexa-tion of the territories in Eastern Europe which have come under the influence of the Central bowers, Austria-Hungary being given part of the Ukraine in exchange for the free hand to be given to Germany elsewhere. Military forces being [at present insufficient for enforcement of such a policy, it is to be postponed for the time being.Austria-Hungary.- Austrian Wireless of May 15th forwarded a message from the &quot; War Office, Vienna,&quot; agreeing to the proposal to send a mission to Russia to take charge of prisoners of war &quot;in accordance with the russian-Austro-Iiunganan Supplementary Treaty of February 12th, 1918, Article VI.&quot; (the Brest Treaty was not signed until March 3rd), and adding that the Russian &quot; request that an analogous Russian mission should be sent to Austria-Hungary is neither agreed to in the Supplementary Treaty, nor is the request based on any necessity.&quot;Finland. On May 14th, Sir E. Howard reported on good authority that a commercial treaty until the end of 1919 had been concluded with. Germany by the Finnish Government. Full details were not available, lint business men were furious at the contents of the published clauses.
