SECRET.85/&apos;APPREGTATTON OE THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No, 59.PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Ppiace Discuss tons.General. There seem to be no limits to the demands imposed by the Germans by force of arms upon all who enter into peace discussions with them. The principles of the Reichstag Resolution of J uly 1.9th, .1.91.7, have been openly abandoned. There is no apparent desire on the part of the Central Powers for a permanent peace, baaed on goodwill, with any enemy country. A. rich future is now put prominently before the people by the Kaiser&apos; as a principal war aim, and the defence of the Fatherland (against imaginary clangers) is less used as camouflage. [See also under &quot;Germany,&quot; below.]The new Black Sea route for tlie Central Powers deserves attention. Attention is also drawn to the separate supplementary treaty contracted by Germany with Russia, as affecting Spitsbergen and merchant shipping.Allied Affairs. The question of intervention in Siberia has not yet been settled.Belgium.German attempts to split up Belgium are of interest. Also their renewed attempts to accuse the Belgians of mortgaging their neutrality (see under Peace Discussions  Germany&quot;).

FART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Far East.- The question of intervention in Siberia is still under the consideration of the Allied Governments.Faio Materials. His Majesty&apos;s Government has notified the Allied Governments of the desirability of collecting data regarding their present and prospective resources and requirements of raw materials. Such information will be useful both for exerting pressure on the enemy by the threat of economic ruin, and for assuring the supplies and industries of the Allies during post-war reconstruction.FRANCE.France and Russia. Lord Bertie reports that on March 4th the Socialist Deputy Bon objected to the recent publication of a letter from the Emperor Nicholas to President Poincare, it being a diplomatic document. M. Pichon replied that the publication was intended to demonstrate that the French Government, like the British, wished to show its assurance that the Imperial Government had remained faithful to the Alliance ; there was no arriere pensee of wishing to re-establish Tzardom. M. Renauclel then requested the publication of the Franco-Russian Treaty, promised by M. Ribot. M. Pichon declared he had no objection, but must study the question. It would be seen that French policy was always profoundly pacific, and that France and Russia did all they could to maintain peace. France entered the war to defend herself against German provocation.M. Qlemenceau and the Socialists. Lord Bertie reports that on March 8th M. Rei.iau.del attacked M. Clemenceau for not doing anything against the Press campaigns directed against the leaders of French policy during the last four years. The Premier replied that Republicans should not fear the liberty of the Press. His first doctrine was liberty, his second, war, to which all must be sacrificed to ensure the triumph of France. Nobody wished, peace more than he, but by bellowing peace Prussian militarism would not be reduced to silence. He taxed the Socialists for debating at the National Congress whether or not they should vote war credits. Before the war certain super-idealists might have hoped by refusing war credits to be imitated by the Germans, but that hope was cruelly deceived by the facts. He asked those who intended to refuse war credits to vote against him. The Order of the Day expressing confidence was adopted by 374 votes to 41, amongst whom were Cachin, Lafont, Laval, Mayeras and Pressemane, and about 70 abstentions including Accambray, Thomas, Dalbiez, Eouget, Renauclel, Sembat and Varenne.BELGIUM.Flemish Movevient. Sir W. Townley cites a Wolff telegram dated March 8th to the Dutch Press, reporting an audience granted by von Falkenhausen, Governor-General of Belgium, to the &quot; Plenipotentiary Council of Flanders.&quot; In acknow-ledging their announcement regarding the election of the Council, the Governor-General said that now or never Avas the occasion to lay the foundation of an Independent Flanders. Their task for the next few months, no matter to what party they belonged, would consist in preparing the Flemish nation for the great decision which it would have to make at the conclusion of peace. (See also Reports Nos. 52-54.)ITALY.Resignation of Minister of War. Sir R. Rodd learns that the Minister of War is offering his resignation and will be succeeded by General Zubelli.Subversive Propaganda. -Sir R. Rodd learns that the enemy is recruiting agents from the invaded districts of Italy, who, under the guise of refugees, are to spread
ssubversive propaganda behind the Italian lines. Certain Socialist elements have also decided to carry on a propaganda among the troops. (See. also Report No...54.) The presence of the British and French forces, however, continues to inspire deter-urination and confidence.Enemy Trading. Sir R. Rodd reports that serious charges of trading with the enemy have been brought by Signbr Birolini against certain, cotton and. silk firms in North Italy.PORTUGAL,Government Changes. Sir L. Carnegie reports the resignation of the Ministry owing to a disagreement regarding the system of electing the President and Parliament. A new administration has been set up, which includes no Unionist element. President Paes continues to act as Minister for War and for Foreign Affairs. Senhor Alachado Santos, Minister of the Interior, has resigned. The Foreign Office learns that certain officials appointed by him during his tenure of office are dangerously pro-German. The Spanish Press reports that he has now been placed in charge of the Ministry of Food Supplies.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Poles and the Austrian Budget. The Kreuzzeitung of Alarch 9th announces the passing of the Austrian Budget, which gives the Government funds till the end of June. The Czech, group voted solid against the entire Bill and the German Social Democrats against the war credit.&apos; The clerical Italians and South Slavs abstained from voting. The Bill was passed owing to the vote of the Bolish Club, amongst whom, were only two dissentients. At a subsequent meeting of the Club, the Social and National Democratic groups resigned their membership. It is stated that the Bolish vote was given on the following conditions, accepted by the Emperor in the absence of Count Czernin : first, that the Bolish Ukraniau frontier should follow the line of the river Bug; secondly, that no further partition of Poland should be made, and no division of Galicia ; thirdly, that an amnesty should be granted to the Polish legion (see below). The Kreuzzeitung declares that if this correctly represents what happened, the Austrian Government must have given guarantees, which, as far as the first two points are concerned, directly affect Gferman Imperial interests, and which, in the case of the second point, are of the most vital kind for Germany.Riots in Croatia. Sir W. Townley learns that owing to riots, martial law has been declared in three counties of Croatia.Morale of the Arm.]/. A telegram from Vienna to the Frankfurter Zeitung states that in the Lower House of the Reichsrath on Tuesday certain Deputies asked the Alinister of National Defence for information regarding the reported mutiny of the Polish Brigade, comprising about 8,000 men, on February 15th. A. Croatian infantry regiment, it was alleged, was ordered to march against the mutineers in order to prevent them from reaching Riiinano-Bessarabian territory via Marmoritza. A pitched battle ensued between the Croatians and the Poles, in &quot;which artillery and machine guns were used. Both sides suffered very heavy losses, but the Bolish legionaries were finally overpowered and taken prisoners. The Foreign Office learns that the morale of the Austrian troops in. Eastern Galicia is extremely bad. According to a Vienna telegram, General Czapp von Birkenstetten, Minister of National Defence, replying in. the Reichsrath to urgent questions relative to repatriated Austro-Hungarian. prisoners of war, said that, whilst the military authorities had ordered them to be treated in the most benevolent and indulgent manner, precautionary measures had to be taken against the propagation of revolutionary tendencies, as proofs were not wanting that among those now returning were a large number who had been won over to revolutionary ideas and who had. been sent back to the country as emissaries of this propaganda. All those, he added, who had actually shown a radical revolutionary tendency would be treated according to the orders applying to the more serious cases. The assertion, however, that, when fit for field service, returned prisoners of war were immediately incorporated in marching formations he-declared to be incorrect.
GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Tlw. Russian Peace. Sir W. Townley reports tire attitudes of various Gorman sections towards the Russian peace. The Minority Socialists are vehemently hostile, pointing out that friendship with the present or any future Russian administration . will be impossible for a long time. The Majority Socialists are disappointed with the peace, and particularly with the Bolshevists for playing into the hands of the Imperialists, thus destroying any hope which German Socialists had of stemming the tide of German annexationism. The Jewish interests, represented by the Frankfurter Zeitung and Berliner Tageblalt, are baulked of their hopes of a &quot; United States of Russia &quot; friendly to Germany and leavening her political institutions. They fear that the States cut off from Russia will presently sigh for reunion with her. The Western. Industrialists, beyond expressing satisfaction at the securing of trade routes through Russia to Persia and Afghanistan, express no special satisfaction; they are anxious lest Militarist annexations in the East should entail abandonment of claims- to the mineral districts of Belgium and Northern France, and they therefore lay stress on the so-called. &quot; self-determination&quot; granted by Germany in the East. Finally, the semi-official Press presents the public with all-round satisfactory assurances. The Cologne Gazette declares that the treaty bids fair to wreck British prestige throughout Asia, besides supplementing the submarine campaign in the work of undermining Mr. .Lloyd George&apos;s position. The Norddeutsche Allgemeine points to four distinct gains achieved by the peace : first, military, namely, the end of war on two fronts ; secondly, political, to wit, the bursting of the &quot; ring of enemies &quot; ; thirdly, general, the laying of Gerniany&apos;s pet bugbear, Umkreisungs Politik ; fourthly, economic, the establishment of complete economic self-sufficiency. (This belief is strongly controverted by Naumann in an. article in the Vossische Zeitung of March 2nd, on Middle European world economics) ; finally, there is the moral victory, &quot; Colossal strengthening of our confidence! in our own cause, and our final success.&quot; . The Russian Wireless Press of March 8th issues the following renunciation of the German. Majority Socialists : &quot; The CounciPs Press announces that Comrades Lenin and &quot; Trotsky have sent to our plenipotentiary in Sweden, Comrade Yorovsky, a &quot; categorical order not to have any, even the most remote connections with the &quot; German Socialist-Imperialists. The group of Scheidernann, David, the adventurer &quot; and speculator Parvus (see Reports Nos. 50 and 54, under Denmark), and others, &quot; have probably been forced so the instruction runs to enter into an agreement &quot; with the direct enemy of our class, the German Imperialists, in the same way as: &quot; strikers come to an agreement with employers. We cannot enter into negotiations &quot; with strike breakers such as the partisans of Scheidemaun, traitors to the working &quot; classes.&quot;Germany and the Poles. During a Polish debate in the Prussian Landtag on March (.5th, Dr. Seyds (Pole) declared that the German policy of annexation would make the peaceable and friendly co-existence of the German and Polish peoples henceforth impossible. &quot; We representatives of the - Polish people in this House &quot; share their indignation to the full, and solemnly protest against this act of violence &quot;against the Polish nation.&quot; Dr. Friedberg (Yice-President) said: &quot;Dr. Seyds &quot; proclaimed himself as representative of the Polish nation in Prussia. I don&apos;t &quot; recognise that firm. I. know here only Prussian Deputies. We cherish no illusions. &quot; We know quite well that only smail groups of Poles desire an understanding with us. What Seyds and his friends may think of the peace we have concluded with &quot; Ukrainia leaves us cold. The existence and life conditions of our Fatherland shall &quot; not be ordained to suit Polish wishes, but exclusively to suit our own requirements.&quot; Fuhrmaim (National Liberal) said that after what Germans had endured from the Poles both at home and abroad, they must reflect before establishing an independent Poland on their flank.Supplies from Ukrainia. A Lokalauzeiger telegram from Berlin gives a glowing account of the food supplies of all kinds found by the German troops in Ukrainia: The Norddeutsche, however, states that in consequence of the great difficulties of transport no adequate assistance for the German food supply can be expected from Ukrainia until the next harvest has been gathered. Sir W. Townley reports a state-men t of the Austrian Press that the Ukraine must supply the Central Powers with- 30,000 wagons of grain, 2,000 wagons of frozen meat, 1,200 wagons of sugar and 1,000 wagons of dried fruit by April 15th. It is added that, in consequence of shortness of rolling stock, a service of motor lorries will be organised to effect transport.
War Supplies and Corruption. In the Main Committee of the Reichstag oh March Sth a debate took- place oil corruption in connection with war works, and the Daimler motor works were made a test case. It was stated that their profits had. been systematically falsified, for years, and that their -profits during the war as compared to pre-war days represented J 73 per cent, over cost price. It was also observed that the War Department had endeavoured to keep clown prices, but that the biggest undertakings still opposed official control.German Federal States and Imperial Taxation. The Intelligence Bureau reports: &quot;A subject which is receiving the attention of experts is the War &quot;Finances of the German. Empire and of the German Federal States, especially in &quot; their inter-connection. Great difficulties are impending in this sphere and strong &quot; protests have been&quot; uttered in the Parliament of different German States, e.r/., in &quot; Baden, Bavaria and Hesse, against further encroachments by the Empire upon the &quot; domain of direct taxation, which the States consider to be their own preserve. &quot; Count Rddern, the Imperial Secretary of State for Finance, appears to have avoided. &quot; this subject in his speech, introducing the Budget last week, and, indeed, he &quot; refrained for the present from giving any indication of the nature of the new &quot; taxation which, he described.&apos; as inevitable&apos;.&quot;Leipzig Fair. The German Wireless Press quotes the Rotterdamsche Gourant as being much impressed with German Industrial activitv as exhibited at Leipzig Fair.Niederbarnim By-election. Sir W. Townley reports that the &quot;Minority Socialist Dr. Breitseheid is opposing He it Wisselt, the Majority Socialist candidate, in the by-election at Niederbarnim on March 14th. This is one of the Potsdam Divisions, a large industrial district, and a stronghold of Majority Socialism. The contest is being accepted by both parties as a test of the popular decision between them, and is therefore highly significant.Unrest in the Army. Sir H. Rumbold, in a despatch dated February 28th, reports that, though the German Government can still depend absolutely on the Army, there is a widespread spirit of unrest among the soldiers, especially in the infantry regiments, owing to the. iron discipline, the prolonged strain, of war, and. a sense of political injustice based on hatred of the ,1 linkers and industrial war-profiteers.NETHERLANDS.German Operations in Dutch Territorial Waters.--hi connection with the recent attack by German hydroplanes on a British convoy in Dutch territorial waters (see Report No. 58), the German Government has expressed its regret to the Netherlands Government and explained that a mistake was made by the airman who dropped the bomb.Socialism, -In a despatch dated. February 22nd, Sir W. Townley traces the recent developments of Socialism in Holland. At a recent conference at Arnheim, the Social Democratic Labour Party adopted, a resolution admitting, as a matter of principle, the participation of the party (subject to guarantees for the materialisation of party claims) in the government of the country. At present the party, led by Troelstra, is represented by 2 members in the Upper House and 15 in the Lower. The number of organised labourers has increased from 189,030 in 1913 to 303,760 in 1.917. A revisal of the franchise has given the vote to all male Hollanders of or over 25 years of age. The &quot;Economic Union &quot; started by M. Treub (see Report No. 51) has been designed to include not only the capitalist classes, but also the lower strata represented by the Trades Unions, and it is quite possible that he may be returned to power at the siunmer elections. It is thus that, seeing its position menaced, the Social Democratic Labour Party has relinquished a dogma for the sake of practical politics, and is now willing to co-operate with, one or more bourgeois groups, with a reason-able prospect of being called upon to assume the responsibility of office. A: younger party, now led by Wijnkoop, seceded in 1909 from the parent group under the name of the Social Democratic Party. It follows the path of orthodox Marxism as opposed to what it calls &quot; Troelstra&apos;s opportunism.&quot; During the war this party has made great progress, 30th absolutely and relatively to the Troelstra Party : this is probably due almost entirely to war conditions--to the growing spirit of anti-militarism, and5257-ib B
to the inadequacy of the Governmental -measures for food distribution. A. further cause of deep dissatisfaction&apos; has been created by the contrast between the wealth and the poverty caused by the Avar. The blame for the sufferings of the poor is attributed by this party to the export policy of the Minister for Agriculture, and. this policy has aroused in it a strong anti-German feeling, in contradistinction, to the rather pro-German sympathies of lYoelstiVs following. There is a third party, the Revolutionary Socialists, which is new and relatively small : it is anti-parlia-mentarian, and urges the workmen to form &quot; Soviets &quot; ; it has already succeeded in forming soldiers&apos; councils. Wijnkoop, while leaving the formation of Soviets to the Revolutionary Socialists, is nevertheless working, with his coadjutor, Madame Roland Hoorst, for the Bolshevists, as their agent and reporter on affairs in Holland and Germany. At present the Troelstra party has an overwhelming majority over the other Socialist groups ; but it, may prove to have compromised itself by the decision to accept Governmental responsibility, and it will have to work hard to keep its popularity. Under normal circumstances the Anarchist group would not have much chance in Holland, but anything may happen when the bacillus of revolutionary anarchy is in the air.Scandinavian-Dutch Traffic. The Foreign Office instructs Sir W. Townley to insist that imports by Dutch, vessels from Scandinavia to Holland should be consigned to the Netherlands Overseas Trust.Daylight Saving.- Sir W. Townley reports the introduction of a Bill to advancelegal time in Holland by one hour from 2 a.m. on April 1st until 3 a.m. on September 30th.And see under &quot;Shipping Situation.&quot;SWITZERLAND.Wheat Supply. -Lord Reading reports that the United States Government, while unable at present to guarantee any definite amount of tonnage for supply of wheat to Switzerland under the American-Swiss Agreement, will shortly reach a decision in the matter. Sir II. Rumbold. reports that the Entente and particularly England  is being blamed by the Swiss for their economic difficulties. It is stated that the German Government has already approached the Swiss Government with a counter-offer, which appears to have been refused. There is, however, a danger that the pro-German political element may take over the question of grain supply from the Military Department, and agree to accept wheat from the Ukraine. (See also Reports Nos. 49-5J, 53, 55 and 58.)Meat Exports. In view of the continuance of meat exports from Switzerland to Germany, His Majesty&apos;s Government is concerting with the French Government in the reduction of the Swiss ration of fresh and preserved meat.   (See Report No. 56.)Cotton Exports. With regard to the question of cotton exports from Switzerland to Germany (see Reports Nos. 51, 52, 53 and 55), the Allied Delegates are still pressing for the entire cessation of export of cotton, tissues, but have offered as compensation to increase the ration for embroidery exports. The Swiss Delegates object that such an arrangement would tend to dislocate Swiss industrial organisa-tions, but it would seem that they are principally actuated by fear of German reprisals.   They are, however, still considering the question.NORWAY.Germany and the Norwegian-American Agreement. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports: &quot;The German Government is protesting strongly against the &quot; ratification by Norway of the Norwegian-American Agreement. It complains that &quot; the Agreement virtually prohibits the export of Norwegian products to Germany. &quot; Idie attitude of the German Government is menacing. It threatens to sink &quot;Norwegian ships bringing supplies to Norway from the United States, and points &quot; out that certain Norwegian towns are within easy reach of German aircraft.&quot; ddie Foreign Office learns that the German Government is openly suggesting that the Allies aim at securing a naval base in Norway, and is spreading rumours that Germany herself may do so. Sir R. Paget believes that both methods are designed merely to intimidate the Norwegian Government, and that, while the latter operation
Ayould appear to be contrary to the interests of Germany, sire has a real fear of the former, in order, probably, to allay&apos; German importunity in this regard, the Norwegian Government has issued to the belligerent Powers a declaration confirming its neutrality. Sir R. Paget considers it possible that Germany is seeking, to estop Norway from, assisting the Allies to help Sweden if she should prove recalcitrant. The German newspapers continue to threaten Norway. The Hamburger FremUciMatt of March 7th asks if she is still neutral, and (according to German Wireless Press) the Norddeulsclie Allgemeine Zeitung &quot;in a critical consideration of Norwegian neutrality, especially of the anti-German excesses of the Norwegian Press,&quot; declares that Germany&apos;s position in the East and North has been, so strengthened by the latest events that.she can regard such an attitude with, regret indeed, but with, complete calmness. The Norwegian newspaper, Verdens Gang, commenting on various indications of increased German activity against neutral States, particularly Norway, mentions that as a result of the U-boat war 31,000 tons of Norwegian shipping has been sunk this year, 11,000 tons having been lost in the last few weeks. The same journal draws attention to an important change of German economic policy towards neutrals. Germany formerly aimed at large exports to neutral countries in return for goods of importance to her and tending to raise the exchange rates of the mark, but now she is evidently more indifferent to foreign goods. Verdens Gang regards as a decisive proof of this change the fact that the German Central Purchase Agency in Norway has resolved to restrict its activity with a view, it is thought likely, to winding up its business.Disturbances in Cliristiania. The Foreign Office learns that on March Oth a disorderly crowd looted various bakers&apos; and. tobacconists&apos; shops in Christian!a. A repetition of such incidents is considered possible.Pyrites. With regard to the suggestion of a British contract for Norwegian pyrites, to be delivered over a term of years (see Report No. 57), the Foreign Office learns that negotiations of a similar character are already contemplated by a German concern.SWEDEN.Germany and Swedish. Negotiations with Allies. With reference to the conclusion by the Swedish Government of the modus vivendi with the Allies (see Report No. 58), the -Frankfurter Zeitung professes to regard this as unneutral conduct, and remarks : &quot; Are the services rendered in exchange really worth the price which Sweden is &quot; prepared to pay ? Has Sweden considered that by her action she is jeopardising &quot; her most precious, and for the future most profitable, possession, her commercial &quot;fleet?&quot; Similar attacks have appeared in the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. Sir E. Howard reports that the Swedish Government is still anxious to conciliate Germany over the question of iron ore, and convinced that the German expedition to Aland was undertaken with the object of exercising pressure&apos; trpon Sweden in regard, to her commercial negotiations. Nevertheless it is desirous of coming to an arrangement with the Allies, especially if such agreement guarantees to Sweden a supply of: cereals and fodder.Wine Embargo. The Foreign Office informs Sir E. Howard that His Majesty&apos;s Government has removed, the specific embargo on strong wines, absinthes and liqueurs for Sweden.And see under &quot; Finland.&quot;DENMARK.Stranded German Prize. Sir R. Paget reports that the Danish Government has received and replied to an official German protest regarding the internment of the prize crew of the S.S. Igotz Mendi (see Reports Nos. 57 and 58). -   .Danish-American Negotiations. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading to recommend to the United States War Trade Board the continuance of its negotiations with the Danish Government (see Reports Nos. 57 and 58) having regard to the political and economic importance of the proposed agreement.Butter. Sir R. Paget reports that the Danish Government is. prepared to sell to Great Britain half the reserve of Danish butter. The Danish Government represents that the price at which it wall be sold entails, a loss to itself of nearly 1,000,000-
crowns, and asks for a quantity of sewing-cotton as compensation, stating that British consent to this would very favourably impress the country. The Danish Government proposes, as consideration for the German share of the reserve, to demand (inter alia) free navigation for Danish shipping to the United States.FINLAND (and ALAND).German Treaty with Finland. According to a Press report, an official telegram from. Berlin states that on March. 7th a peace treaty was signed between Germany and Finland. A. trade and shipping agreement and a supplementary protocol to both treaties were also signed. In Article 1 of the treaty it is declared that no state of war exists between. Germany and Finland, and that the contracting parties are resolved henceforth to live with each, other in peace and friendship. Germany will, exert herself to secure recognition by all the Powers of FinlancVs autonomy and. independence. On the other- hand, Finland will cede no portion of her territory to a foreign Power, nor grant such Power any easement on territory over which she is sovereign without previously having come to agreement with Germany. The articles which, follow relate to the resumption of diplomatic and. consular relations immediately after the ratification of the peace treaty, the renunciation by each party of compensation for war costs and war damages, and the restoration of State treaties, except those between Germany and Russia which have lapsed. these are to be replaced by new treaties corresponding to altered views and conditions. In particular negotiations are to start immediately for a trade and shipping treaty. Meanwhile, trade relations will be regulated between both countries by a trade and shipping agreement. The payment of obligations, particularly the Public Debt service, is to be resumed. For the settlement of the Aland. Islands, it is laid down that the fortifications shall be removed as speedily as possible, and the permanent no 11-fortification of the islands is to be regulated by special agreement. The iiistru-mems of, ratification are to be exchanged in Berlin as soon as possible. Four months after the ratification representatives of the contracting parties will meet in Berlin for the purpose of drawing up a supplementary&apos; treaty.According to- a Berlin telegram published in the Swedish papers on March 10th, the Commercial and Shipping Treaty provides that subjects of either of the contracting parties shall enjoy the same rights in trade and other occupations as natives. With regard to&apos; stipulations making Finnish citizenship a condition of holding shares in certain Finnish companies, German citizens will as soon as possible be placed on an equality with Finns in this respect. Farm, products, &amp;c, shall be treated according to the most-favoured-nation principle. As long as this agreement remains valid, the Finnish, tariff of January 1st, 1914, will, be applied towards Germany. Sir E. Howard-reports that the announcement of this treaty has caused much annoyance and apprehension in Sweden. The Liberal, papers observe that it prejudices the question of the settlement of Aland in a manner hardly consistent with promises recently made; and that it weakens the position of Sweden, in relation to both groups of belligerent Powers. They also point out that the treaty has obviously been- planned, for a long time, and could not possibly have been averted by any Swedish help to Finland. Daghens Nyheter declares that though it now seems as if Germany had secured -Finland more easily than Poland, the Baltic provinces or the Ukraine, those who know the Finnish racial character will realise that Germany will find Finland a difficult morsel to digest. Aftontidning, in an article entitled &quot; Finland sold to Germany,&quot; remarks that Sweden will maintain complete liberty of action as regards the Allies, and a general agreement with them, no matter how long German troops remain upon Aland. The Conservative papers show a great revulsion of feeling towards- Finland, but have hardly made up their minds what attitude to adopt.. Nya Dagligt Allehanda,-however,- points out the very serious consequences, to Sweden of Germany&apos;s success in barring Russia from the West.Finland and TSUtlel Furopa. The antecedents of the Finnish Foreign Minister,. M\ Sario (see Report No. 57) and an interview with him reported, in- Daghens Nyhcler of March 7th, make it clear that the new Treaty constitutes a definite alliance between Germany and Finland, completing the Mittel Europa scheme so as to exclude Russia- from) the Western Powers. This fact, is recognised- by the Liberal Party in. Sweden, and the Danish paper Volntikerv publishes documents suggesting.
that tlie Finnish Minister in Stockholm and the Swedish Activists have co-operated in the scheme.Rumoured German Monarchy. -The Swedish Press mentions a rumour that the Finns have requested the permission of. Germany to appoint Prince Oscar, son of the Kaiser, or some other German Prince, as King of Finland.Whites and Reds. Fighting continues between the White and Red Forces. The latter now appear to he more formidable than was first reported. General IVianner-heini, though accepting German co-operation with reluctance, considers it preferable to any sort of accommodation with the Reds. Swedish newspapers of March 1.0th announced that M. Swiuhufvud. the Premier of the White Government, has escaped to Reval, and is probably on his way to Berlin.Ships and, War Material&apos; at Helsingfors. -The Foreign Office learns that all. transports and stores (including a great quantity of machinery, metals and oils) at Helsingfors are about to be sold by a Russo-Finnish Committee for Liquidation. Three groups are competing for purchase ; a Swedish-Finnish, an International, and a pro-German Jewish. It is probable that the Germans will presently send a force to Helsingfors. The new German Ambassador, Baron von Brueck, is already on his way. Meanwhile (according to a Wolff telegram to the Dutch Press) four Russian cruisers have arrived there from Reval, and the Russian sailors have formed a &quot; Red Fleet &quot; in spite of the Peace Treaty.The Allied Missions, The Foreign Office learns that the British Diplomatic and Military representatives from Petrograd, who left Helsingfors on March 4th, arrived in Stockholm on March 10th after traversing the Red and AYhite lines. The French, Belgian and Serbian Missions are still, held up at Taiumerfors.Food Supply. The stock of grain available for distribution will be exhausted before the spring, and the Government will then have to provide 20,000 tons monthly until, the harvest. The supply of meat and potatoes will, also presently fail, and owing to the wanner weather the transport of fish will become difficult. According to the Swedish Press, the Finnish Government has made an agreement with Germany to import 15,000 tons of cereals per month for three months.Finnish Protests regarding Swedish Occupation, of Aland. According to the Swedish Press, protests are being made to the Swedish Government by both the White and Red Governments of Finland. A (Swedish Blue Book published on March 7th establishes that a general, agreement bad, as the result of the Swedish expedition, already been reached between the various parties in the Islands with the knowledge of the Finnish Minister in Stockholm before the receipt by him of General Manner-heim&apos;s contrary instructions for the White Guard.German Occupation of Aland Islands. On March 5th two German, warships anchored at Eckero, in the Aland Islands, alongside of tire Swedish warships. On the 6th the German flag was hoisted from the Custom House. On the 7th the German squadron was reported as consisting of the Dreadnoughts Rheinland and Westphalen, five transports and two icebreakers. .1,500 to 2,000 men of the 14th and 15th Jager Battalions, and 300 horses have been landed ; and a hangar lias been erected. The Germans have taken prisoners the Russian garrison. The Swedish Government on completing the evacuation of the remaining Russians, Poles, Esthonians and Letts, will probably withdraw its forces, in consideration of the German assurances against the fortification or permanent occupation of the islands.Appeal of Alanders, -A Press report dated March 10th states that by telegrams addressed simultaneously to the Senate of Finland, the King of Sweden, and the German Emperor, the inhabitants of Aland Islands renew their request that the islands should be reunited to Sweden, from which they were separated by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn of 1809. They declare that by vote taken throughout the islands between December 25th-29th, 95 per cent, of the inhabitants had in virtue of the right of self-determination declared in favour of union with Sweden, and they now unanimously demanded that this desire, as in the case of Finland, be recognised immediately or else be submitted for consideration at the conclusion of peace. They declare further that if any of the Powers they now appeal to deem it necessary, a new vote should be taken in the presence of the Swedish and German troops, which vote shall be conclusive.

[ivr.o.
Russian Protest to Germany. The Bolshevist Government has (hy Wireless of March 10th) protested to the German Government against the German occupation of the Aland Islands, as being in contradiction of the peace treaty.French View. The French Minister has informed the Swedish Foreign Office that in the view of the French Government, the Aland question, whenever it comes up for discussion, can only be settled in accordance with France in so far as she is concerned as a signatory of the dTeaty of 1856.Swedish Views on German Action. Daghens Nyheter and. Social Demohraten support the action of the- Swedish Government in regard to the Aland affair, and bitterly attack the conduct of Finland. The Conservative Press attacks the Govorn-mentfor not having intervened in Finland and attributes the German action to this cause. One paper even considers that the conclusion of the modus vivendi with the Allies would justify further designs by Germany upon the islands. The Nya Dagligt Allehanda, however, notes the significance of the Russo-German Treaty as giving Germany a final voice in the settlement of the Aland question. The Gothenburg Handels Tidning reports the subservience of the Conservatives to German influence and asks that the situation should be regarded from a patriotic national point of view.German Motives. Regarding the Aland, expedition, the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (quoted by German Wireless) writes : &quot; The German undertaking has taken &apos;; place exclusively on the ground of the urgent Call for help of the Finnish &quot; Government, which begged Germany to support Finland in the re-establishment of &quot; order and in her fight against the anarchist bands which come especially from &quot; Russia. The right of Germany to help the Finnish Government at the instance of &quot; the latter has not been denied from any side in a serious manner, not even on the &quot; part of Sweden. In spite of her absolute right, Germany treated with Sweden and &quot; came to an understanding with her.&quot; The Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung of March 6th observes that the real purpose of the German expedition to Finland is suppression of the Democratic Bacillus. The Kblnische Zeitung of March 8th declares that the Swedes have no right to complain of what is happening in the Baltic, since they have brought it all upon themselves by their toleration of Branting&apos;s pro-Fntente policy. The Weser Zeitung of March 5th after accusing the Swedish Government of refusing help, to Finland on democratic grounds goes on to point out that Sweden has now transferred her distrust from Russia to Germany. Cnder the projected agreement with the Entente a considerable portion of her fleet is to pass into English and American service; and although she is no longer a line of transit for munitions to Russia she hopes to become the highway and centre of a new^and active West-Eastern Commercial Intercourse. 11 In a word, hopes now arise on the &quot; far side of the Baltic of being able gradually to exclude Hamburg and Bremen &quot; shipping lines from sea traffic in the Baltic.&quot; The Swedish attitude towards Finland is then contrasted with that of Germany, &quot; who without arriere pensee of &quot; either a political or economic nature hurried to the rescue. It is hoped that our &quot; unselfish action in this matter will not be misunderstood in Finland itself, but wdll &quot; earn for us the grateful friendship of that country.&quot;SPAIN.Cortes and Cabinet. The Intelligence Bureau reports the constitution of the Cortes to have resulted under the elections as follows : Liberal groups : Followers of the Prime Minister (Marquis of Alhucemas) 95; of Count Romanones, 40; of Senor Alba, 30. Conservative groups: Followers of Senor Dato, 94; of Sehor Maura, 27 ; of Senor La Gierva, 25. The &quot; Bloc &quot; of the Left holds 65 seats, including 35 Regionalists, 15 Republicans, 9 Reformists (Moderate Republicans), and 6 Socialists. Nine Cariists have been elected, one Agrarian, and about a dozen representatives of other very small sections. Lerroux, the Republican leader, was defeated in two constituencies. Melcbiades Alvarez, the leader of the Reformists, was defeated in one place, but elected in another. The imprisoned Strike Committee won seats at Madrid, Barcelona, and. Valencia. On the whole, the anti-Monarchical groups have lost ground instead of gaining it. The new Parliament is, however, a divided, body and provides no sure support for any statesman. Idle King has requested the Marquis of Alhucemas to retain office : and he has clone so with the same colleagues except that Vehtosa and
Roues (both good friends of the Allies) have resigned, and been replaced, by Si 1 vela (formerly editor of the Prime Ministers paper, Mariana), and. Yentosa (who has been negotiating the agreements with Prance and America). Sir A. Hardinge reports that trouble has already arisen in the Cabinet owing to the insistence of La Gierva, Minister for War, on the carrying out of certain military reforms (involving increased expenditure) by Royal Decree without submitting them to the approval of the Cortes. As a result, Senor Gimeno (Rbmanonist), Minister of Marine, resigned. Subsequently La Cierva, without consulting his colleagues, attacked in the Press a Conservative ex-president of the Senate for having disparaged the Army. On this the resignation of all the Ministers was accepted by the King, but subsequently withdrawn with his approval. Senor Gimeno lias again joined the Cabinet against the wishes of Count Romanones. The Intelligence Bureau notes the possibility and danger of a militant and therefore pro-German administration under Cierva emerging from the present situation. Such an experiment would probably be shortlived in view of the coin-mercial disadvantages which would result, the growing indignation against German intrigue and submarine warfare, and the awakening of the democratic spirit in Spai n.Senate. According to Madrid papers of Alarch 30th, the result of the elections to the Senate are as follows: 40 Democrats, 40 Conservatives, 14 Albisfs, 13 Romanonists, 8 Regionalists, 6 Ciervists, 5 Independent Liberals, 5 Maurists, 5 Jaimists, 8 Gassetists, 2 Independents, 2 Integrists, 3 Nationalists, 2 Independent Conservatives, 2 Republicans, and 1 Catholic.German Intrigues. Sir A. Hardinge reports the publication by the pro-Ally newspaper Sol of a facsimile of a letter from the First Secretary of the German Embassy to a well-known anarchist named Pascual. According to Press reports the latter shows that the Embassy was supplying money to Pascual for the printing of a fly-leaf, which was an Anarchist sheet directed against shipowners. Pascual has admitted that he paid several Ausits to the Embassy where he Avas given instructions to create disturbances and organise revolutionary strikes, especially such as would interfere with exports to the Allies, in particular he was desired to foment attacks against Count Romanones ; and some of the proposals in this connection were of such a nature that he shrank from them, though promised protection against the police. At the request of the German Legation the Spanish Government has seized the edition of the Sol in which these revelations appear, as well as other papers, reproducing them ; but the news has already produced a great sensation.Spanish-American Agreement. Sir A. llardinge reports the signature of the Spanish-American Agreement, and its ratification on March 7th. Under Article 9 each country is to furnish tonnage for its own requirements. Article 13 provides for a further shipping agreement.Franco-Spanish Agreement. The Financial Agreement between France and Spain was ratified on the same date. Under it the French obtain a credit for the current year of 350,000,000 pesetas guaranteed by the deposit of 5 per cent. French Treasury Bonds at an interest (not to exceed 7-1- per cent, including brokerage and commission) to be fixed between the lending and borrowing banks, dire Foreign Office has instructed Lord Bertie to call the attention of the French Government to a statement in the Spanish Press of the terms of the agreement, according to which it Avould appear that the transit through France to Spain of enemy goods from switzerland is contemplated.Spanish Wheat Supply. With regard to the suggestion that the Spanish Govern-ment should purchase a certain quantity of Argentine grain through Allied Agents (see Report No. 57), Sir A. Hardinge now reports that it is unwilling to give such agents exclusive right of purchase, but agrees that the Spanish Ambassador at Buenos Aires should maintain close contact with the Wheat Commissioner.CHINA.Government. Sir J. Jordan reports that the Military Governor of Mukden has seized a consignment of arms sent by Japan to the Chinese Government tinder the recent agreement (see Report No. 57 under &quot;Allied. Affairs &quot;), and is advancing with a force towards Peking and Tientsin, apparently Avith the intention of compelling the President to take strong action against the South, and to restore Tuan Gllijui as
Premier. Rumours continue of the possible restoration of a Manchu dynasty under a Chinese Regency, or of the institution of a military oligarchy. The former alternative is deprecated, by Tuan Chijui, who is, however, strongly hostile to the President, and anxious to undertake operations in Manchuria in co-operation with the Japanese. Meamvhile the officials who participated in the movement for restoration in July last have been set free, and it is probable that Changhsun himself may be pardoned.Enemy Aliens. Sir J. Jordan reports that the Chinese Government lias notified the representatives of Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands that owing to changed conditions affecting enemy prisoners in Siberia, the Tientsin Hilfsaktion must now cease its operations.CHILE.Crew of German Raider. Sir P. Stronge reports the arrival in Chile of the captain and part of the crew of the German raider Seeadler. These men, after the wreck of the Seeadler near Tahiti, succeeded in reaching Easter Island in another vessel which they had seized, and were brought thence to Chile, where they have been deprived of their arms by the naval authorities, and placed aboard an interned Ger.ir.an steamer.Nitrate Production. Sir E. Stronge learns that nitrate producers in Chile are being pressed by the Chilian Government to combine. It is stated that those who refuse to join will be made liable to increased duties. Sir F. Stronge points out that the necessity of paying a continually increasing percentage of the export duty in gold will tend to discourage production, and suggests that the Allied Governments may consider it desirable themselves to pay the proposed duties and to offer certain guarantees.COLOMBIA.Colombian ^Government and. Germany. Mr. Wynclham reports an increasing bias of the Colombian Government towards Germany. The -President has recently appointed to the Foreign Affairs Committee Senhor Goretarz, a violent propagandist against the United States. It is probable that the Government is anxious to stand well with. Germany, in the belief that she will be in a position to assist towards a settlement of the Panama question favourable to Colombia.MEXICO.The Oilfields. The Foreign Office learns that conditions in the oil district have now become worse. The forces of Carranza and Pelaez have been in conflict, to the disadvantage of the former. The Government troops are hungry, unpaid, and demoralised. Both sides are committing depredations and abuses, and interfering, with the operations of the oil companies. Caballero has gone to Mexico City in connection with his election. Air. Cummins still deprecates recognition of Carranza,. and his view coincides with information received by Lord Reading, who learns that Carranza is in contact with, the German Minister and has recently received a loan from German sources.Insurrections. Mr. Cummins learns that military risings have taken place at Chihuahua, Puebla, Mexico City, and in Michoacan.CUBA.Censorship. Mr. Leech reports the establishment in Cuba of a censorship organisation, acting in co-operation with the United States authorities.SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. According to the. War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing-ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period March 1st to 7th inclusive, was 63,102 tons gross, of which 39,187 were British, as-compared with 90,9.13 tons gross, of which 59,748 were British, reported last week.
Dutch, Shipping. Owing to the continued, non-fulfilment by the Dutch, of the Provisional Shipping Agreement the British and United States Governments have now proposed, to the Netherlands Government that the Allies should make immediate and unrestricted use of the Dutch tonnage in &quot;British and United States ports, guaranteeing to replace after the war any ships sunk in the war zone by enemy action. Failing acceptance of this proposal by March 18th, it may be necessary to requisition the Dutch shipping. The United States has offered in any event to supply the Netherlands Government immediately with 50,U00 tons of foodstuffs at an American port, and a similar amount later on. The Dutch Press announces that Dutch Rhine vessels are to be recalled from Germany. The reason suggested is the necessity for ascertaining whether a large number have been sold to Germany contrary to the Ships Export I jaw. Sir W. Townley reports a rumour that, the recall is really due to fear that Germany may seize these vessels in the event of Dutch ocean-going tonnage being-placed at the disposal of the Allies.Japanese Shipping for United States. The Foreign Office learns that the Japanese Government has arranged to charter .1.50,000 tons dead weight of shipping to the United States Shipping Board for Allied, purposes. This transfer is independent of the proposals mentioned, in Report No. 5-1.America and British Shipping. In a Memorandum (G.T. 3825), dated March 6th, the Shipping Controller makes certain recommendations for alleviating the strain placed upon British tonnage in the transportation of United States troops and material.rGreek Shipping. At the request of M. Venizelos, His Majesty&apos;s Government is taking special measures to make good the tonnage requirements of Greece.Exports to Russia.-^-Lord Reading reports that although the United States Government has objected to any formal cessation of exports to Russia, the War Trade Board has agreed to instruct United States Consids in Japan to watch the disposal of goods imported from the United States.Insurance Rates. In reply to representations by Sir M. Findlay (see Report No. 58), His Majesty&apos;s Government has assented to the reduction in the rates of war insurance.Insurance Documents. In reply to the suggestion of His Majesty&apos;s Government that insurance documents should be held back until the relative vessels reach their destinations (see Report No. 5S), Lord Reading reports that similar precautions are already taken in regard to ships destined for countries other than Great Britain, Frauce and Italy, and that exports direct to the latter two countries are negligible. Moreover, a general application of the measure pnoposed would tend to dislocate the insurance business and to prejudice British insurance companies.And. see under &quot;Switzerland,&quot; &quot; Norway,&quot; &quot;Denmark,&quot; and &quot;Spain.&quot;PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. (Brest-Litovsk Treaty.) Russian AVireless of March 9th announced that the peace concluded at Brest-Litovsk was not a peace based upon the free agreement of the peoples of Russia, Germany, Austro-Hungary and Turkey, but a peace dictated under force of arms. The Russian delegates at Brest announced, &quot; We are going to &quot; sign immediately the Treaty presented to us as an ultimatum, but at the same time &quot; we refuse to enter into any discussion of these terms.&quot;The Intelligence Bureau on March. 7th issued a report on the Brest negotiations from December 22nd to March 3rd. This report quotes a statement by Lenin that Russia must have some months&apos; respite to recover both morally and materially, and that a new army, filled with revolutionary fervour, will be ready to fight at the end of that period. The opinion, is expressed that indications seemed to show that the&apos; majority at the Congress at Moscow on March 12th would be in&apos; favour of war. In any case it was not thought possible that a real peace could be made between two Governments of such fundamentally different views.Mr. Wardrop on March 8th. expressed his confidence that the war with Germany would continue, irrespective of the Government which might be in power in Russia. On the same date he forwarded extracts from the Bolshevist Press, including one&apos; from a paper called The Moscow Gazette Red Army, saying that peace would probably be ratified, but that there must be some guarantee that the peace offered by Germany
should not be servitude for Russia. The article gives the provisos which would satisfy this condition. On March 12th Mr. Wardrop again reported that peace would be temporary.Mr. Lockhart, on March 10th, expressed Jus opinion that the Moscow Congress would be certain to agree to a ratification of a peace with Germany, and emphasised the importance of our realising in this country that this must not be interpreted to mean that the Bolshevist idea Avas to surrender completely to the Germans. On March 12th he gave 14 days for the probable endurance of the peace respite.Russian Wireless of March 10th issued a protest, signed by Chicherin, as Assistant of People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, against the German Wireless announcement of March 8th, about the occupation of the Aland islands. Chicherin claims that &quot; A &quot; one-sided occupation of the Aland Islands is in contradiction of Article 6 of the &quot; Peace Treaty concluded with Germany, which provides for an international &quot; settlement of this question.&quot;   [Sec also under F/nhind.]In connection Avith the Brest-Litovsk peace discussions, Sir C. Marling reports on reliable information (March 12th) negotiations between Germany and Turkey on the one hand, and Persian representatives on the other, which would secure advantages for Germany.Russia.. Russian Wireless of March 9th publishes a message, received from Odessa, stating that peace had been concluded with Rumania on the terms proposed by the Council&apos;s authority, and accepted by Rumania, ddie message is signed by the &quot; Vice-President of the Regional Staff,&quot; and the terms refer chiefly to Bessarabia, which Rumania promises to evacuate within two months. According to the message, the terms appear to be based on the assumption that negotiations between Rumania and Germany had been broken off, and that Rumania was in danger of being obliged to capitulate in face of the advance of the German army.Ukraine. The British Government have informed the Ukrainian representatives with whom they are in touch that Great Britain will not recognise any peace involving Ukrainia without previous consultation with that country, and the French Government have acted similarly. Information to this effect was communicated to Sir G. Barclay by the Foreign Office on March 8th.Poland. Sir W. Townley, on March 9th, reported a heated, debate on Poland (peace conditions) in the Prussian Landtag on March 6th.The Intelligence Bureau, on March 6th, gave details on good authority (M. Kameneff, one of the Bolshevist members of the Delegation at&apos; Brest) of the frontier planned between Poland and Lithuania during the Brest negotiations.ddie British Government have informed the Polish representatives with whom, they are in touch that Great Britain will not recognise any peace involving Poland without previous consultation, with that country, and the French Government have acted similarly. Information to this effect was communicated to Sir G. Barclay by the Foreign Office on March 8th.Rumania,. [Sec, also under Russia.&apos;] Sir G. Barclay on March 4th reported the further German ultimatum adding harsh demands made upon Rumania by the Austro-Germans. Lord Bertie on March 7th reported, on the authority of the four Allied Ministers at Jassy (March 5th), that von Kuhhnann and Count Ox em in had threatened definitely to break off negotiations for peace unless a meeting took place on March 4th before noon, and giving details of the new demands referred to by Sir G. Barclay.German Wireless of March 7th published the terms of the Treaty signed between the Quadruple Alliance and Rumania at 7 p.m. on March 5th at the Buftea Castle, near Bucharest (see footnote on page 11, Western Report No. 58). Rumania in this Treaty relinquishes the Dobrudja as far as the Danube to the Allied Powers. Article 3, about the frontier demanded by Austria-Hungary, is omitted from the account as given in German Wireless. It was ^published in the Times of March 7 th.German Wireless of March 8th explains that the return of the Dobrudja as far as the Danube into the hands of the Quadruple Alliance took place in order to render the position easier for Rumania.   [See also under Bulgaria.][By direction of the War Cabinet the General Staff are considering and reporting on aspects of the new Black Sea routes, opened up for the Central Powers by the terms of the peace treaties with the Ukraine and Rumania.]   &apos;
On March. 8th Sir W. Townley drew attention, to a leading article in Germania of &quot;March 7th, in which the point is made that Rumania, thanks to the breaking up of Russia, would be compelled to sign peace within a given time of 14 days.On. March lOth-llth Sir W. Townley quoted an article in the Lokalanzeiler of March 7th, expressing the opinion that Germany would impose an indemnity of one milliard marks (which does not figure in the conditions so far made public), and information from the Dusseldovfer Nac.hricliien of March 9th that the indemnity -would take the form of deliveries of corn and petroleum.Lord Bertie on March 10th reported a telegram from the four Allied Ministers at -Jassy, expressing the fear that the enemy might demand all war material to be handed over, whereby the Allied interests would suffer.Finland. [German Wireless of March 5th reported that the German Ambassador at Stockholm had informed the Swedish Government that Germany intended, at the request of the Finnish Government, to send troops to -Finland, and gave the assurance that Germany is not territorially interested in the Aland Islands, of which use would be made in the course of the operations.]German Wireless of March 8th gave a short resume of the Peace Treaty signed between Germany and Finland on March 7th.. A shipping agreement and a supple-nientary protocol were signed on the same day.German Wireless of March 9th and 10th gave a complete account of the Peace &quot;Treaty between Germany and Finland. Germany undertakes to do what she can to bring about the recognition of the independence of Finland by all Powers, but -stipulates that Finland, shall, not cede any part of her possessions to any Foreign Power without an understanding having first been come to with Germany on the. matter.   [See also under FINLAND on page 8.]German Wireless of March 10th. stated, that the German Press, discussing the peace with Finland, emphasied the resulting re-adjustment of the j)political relations of the whole of the Baltic Sea district.Russian Wireless of March 1.0th issued the terms of a Treaty between the Russian -and Finnish Socialist Republics. The Treaty is signed by Lenin and Trotsky, on the part of the Soviet and. the Peoples Commissaries, and by Eduard Gulling and Oscap Tokoi on the other side. The chief point in the agreement appears to be that each contracting party hands over all real estates to the other if situated in the otheFs territory.Germany. Sir W. Townley on. March 8th forwarded extracts from the German Press about the future effect which the Russian Peace Treaty is expected to have on -Germany. The Norddentsche Allgemeine Zeitung emphasises the fact that neither the ambition of Czarism to beat the Germans in the field, nor that of the Bolshevists to beat them by political means, had succeeded, and expresses the hope that differences of opinion may disappear, and that friendship may again blossom between the Germans and the Russians.Referring to the conclusion of peace with Russia, the Kaiser sent a message to the &quot;Vice-President of the Reichstag which contains the words : &quot; I do not doubt that &quot; a rich, strong and happy future will arise out of the storms and sacrifices of this &apos;&quot; time.&quot;The Intelligence Bureau on March 7th published an analysis of the Peace Treaty with Russia, and of Count Hertling&apos;s announcement about this Treaty and. that with the Ukraine. Attention is drawn to the KaiseFs telegram to Count Hertling, saying that the treaty with the Russian Republic had been gained &quot;by the German sword.&quot; It does not, therefore, fulfil the demands of the Reichstag Resolution of July 3 9th, 1917, which contemplated^a peace by understanding and declared that forcible extensions of territory and political economic or financial acts of aggression were incompatible with such a peace.The Intelligence Bureau also draws attention, to the vigorous revival of German, attacks on Belgium for her alleged violation of neutrality before the war, but mentions that those charges were finally disposed of long ago by Baron Boy ens, who was Belgian Ambassador in Berlin when war broke out. [Sir Theodore Cook&apos;s refutation was drawn attention to in last week&apos;s Western Report. A further refutation was published by a member of the Belgian General Staff in a supplement to the 1&apos;cvne Militaire Snisse of October 1917.]Sir W. Townley on March 10th quoted from an article in the.Kdlnische Zeiiung of &quot;March 8th, in which a statement is made that Count Reventlow&apos;s opinions about the freedom of the seas could only be considered as an expression of Pan-German views.5257-26 E
German Wireless of March 8th reports an article by &quot;Deputy Gispert in the-Norddeubsche, commenting on the attempt made by the Allied Socialist Conference in London to ensure that it should be followed by a Conference of: Socialists of all countries, Berne being fixed as the place where it should sit on May 21st. The article-gives a precis of the conditions agreed to at the London Conference, and states that German Socialists at the possible Berne Conference would, not be able to agree to the-London Resolutions. Deputy Gisbert supports the idea of having a Conference at Berne to occupy itself with the demands of the working man.German Wireless of March 10th gives the 10 headings of the &quot; German-Russian Supplementary Treaty,&quot; which included, &quot;the disposal of mercantile vessels and their, cargoes which have come into the hands of the enemy,&quot; and- the &quot; organisation of the Spitz bergen Arch, i pelago.&apos;&apos;Austria Hungary. German Wireless of March 7th published a reply to KrylenkoV protest of March 5th.   The reply states that Austro-Hungarian troops, in lending; their aid to the  Ukraine, have only engaged, in fighting at places where enemy resistance had to be broken.Bulgaria. German Wireless of Alarch 6th reported a speech by the Bulgarian Finance Minister in the Sobranje about peace negotiations with Rumania. He explained that the Breliminary Peace Treaty would have the same text for all the-Allies, but that in the final Peace Treaty it would be expressly laid down that Rumania would cede the Dobrudja to Bulgaria.Sir W. Townley on March 6th drew attention to an article in the Norcldeubsclie Allgcmeine Zeitung of the 4-th, quoting from, an official Bulgarian paper which advocates the acknowledgment of Bulgarian claims based on what she has done for the cause of the Quadruple Alliance. The article contains the words &quot;The Turks. &quot; and we must draw a lesson from the past, inasmuch, as, relying mutually upon each &quot; other, we endeavour to hold that which ice (sic) have acquired by our own victory, &quot; developing those advantages which peace has brought us.&quot; [The article does not state what Turkey has acquired, compared with what she has lost, and may be found, useful for propaganda as affecting Turkey.]France--Lord Bertie on. March 7th reported that there were fewer comments in the French Press on. the second. Lansdowne letter than there were on the first, and gave extracts. The general attitude of French criticism appears from these extracts to be polite.Lord Bertie on March 6th reported a statement in Hunianite that the Coalition of&quot; the General Confederation of Workers and of the Socialist Party met on March 6th to discuss the means of giving effect to the Resolution of the London Socialist Conference,, and they decided to commence propaganda on the subject, to bring the Resolutions to the knowledge of the working masses. The Commission decided to appoint delegates to join the Inter-Allied Socialist Delegation. &quot; Under mandate to proceed to the United States to the American Labour and Socialist Organisations.&quot; [See also under United States.]Italy. The Intelligence Bureau on March 7th gave the full text of the President of the Council&apos;s speech expressing sympathy with the oppressed nationalities of Austria-Hungary. Both in his speech, and that of Baron Sonnino charges of Imperialism in her war aims against Italy are refuted.Vatican. The Foreign Office on Alarch 7th conveyed to Mr. Gaisford privately the information that the British Government hoped the Vatican would not assume an attitude of approval, directly&apos; or indirectly, towards the peace conditions which Germany has lately imposed upon the victims of her aggression.On Alarch 10th Air. Gaisford replied that the Pope had communicated with his representatives in Austria, Bavaria, and Turkey on the subject of the conditions affecting Armenia, and that be had sent a letter to the Sultan to intercede on behalf of the Armenians.United States. Lord Reading has asked (March 11th) for information about the-proposed visit of M. Huysmans and others to the United States, following on the resolutions of the Allied Labour and Socialist Conference held in London in February. [See also under France above.]Great Britain. The Ministry of Labour, in a report for the week ending-March 6th, stated that Labour Press  comments on the Conference of Interallied.
Socialists in London are, on the whole, very favourable, and that dissent is expressed only from the extreme wings.GENERAL.Dropping of Pamphlets by Airmen.
