PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.GENERAL.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period June 14th-20th inclusive, was 39,079 tons gross, of which 19,116 were British, as compared with 102,961 tons gross, of which 68,421 were British, reported last week.The Koningin Regentes. The Admiralty reports that the area within a 5-mile radius from the position in which the Kbningin Regentes was sunk (see Reports Nos. 72 and 73) has been searched for mines, hut none have been found. On the other hand, new German moored mines have been located in the direct line of passage agreed, upon for repatriation vessels, and nine such mines were swept up between the 2nd and 7th of June.Anglo-German Conference regarding Prisoners.- Progress is being made at The Hague towards an agreement regarding British and German prisoners of Avar. An -adjournment is taking place, during which the delegates are consulting their respective Governments on outstanding questions, while sub-committees are sitting to settle matters of minor importance.Reported Preaches by German Authorities of Prisoners&apos; Agreements. The Foreign Office is informed of various cases in which the German military authorities are ignoring agreements made regarding prisoners of war, e.g., by (1) mutilation of acknowledgment cards; (2) interception of foodstuffs and medical supplies, and (3) withholding names and news of prisoners. His majesty&apos;s Government has demanded an immediate explanation and an assurance that these abuses have been rectified.British Prisoners in Bulgaria. His Majesty&apos;s Government is examining the question of an arrangement with the Bulgarian Government for a wider exchange or neutral internment of British and Bulgarian prisoners.Consumptive Indian Prisoners in Rumania.  His Majesty&apos;s Government is pressing for the transfer by the German. Government of consumptive Indian prisoners from Rumania to Switzerland, the Swiss Government having already signified its consent to their admission.Far East. It was reported to the Foreign Office on June 18th that Colonel Semenov&apos;s forces had been obliged to retire towards the Chinese frontier.   Later reports explain this retirement by the fact that the enemy troops contained a German and Austrian element, estimated at 4,000 to 8,000 men.   Aeroplanes were also being employed by the enemy.   It would appear that Semenov&apos;s position has been somewhat eased by the activities of the Czechs in Siberia.   It is stated that Count Aiirbach is much alarmed by these activities, which are attributed by him, and apparently by the generality of Russians in Moscow, to the astuteness of Anglo-French, diplomacy.  Russian Wireless of June 21 st communicates an article in the Izvestia headed &quot; A. last warning;&quot; pointing out to the Allies the futility of intervention.   &quot; By such methods they will only stray away from their real goal, and will give to Germany new pretexts for pushing her territorial conquests towards the East.   They will not create difficulties for the enemy, but will only contribute to fresh successes for Germany and will frustrate all efforts to establish friendly relations with revolutionary Russia.&quot;   This article, is quoted by German Wireless of June 24th, which, however, omits all reference to German ambition.   It is nevertheless reported that the German Govern-ment has offered assistance to the Bolshevists against the Czecho-Slovaks and that German, forces are concentrating at Smolensk, apparently  with that object.    A meeting was held on June 18th at Harbin of representatives of the industrial, commercial, and capitalist classes in Siberia, at which it was resolved to appeal for
Allied military intervention for the purpose of opposing the Germans and restoring order in Siberia and Russia. On June 20th a further meeting was held by representatives of democratic institutions and peasant co-operative societies in various parts of Siberia, -at which it was resolved to request Allied military intervention to assist the Russian people in forcibly opposing enemy prisoners of war (who, in the opinion, of the meeting, constituted the sole remaining support of the Bolshevists), to prevent the further-&quot;encouragement of German Imperialism in Russia and Siberia, and to assist in the restoration of the Eastern front and the annulment by Russia of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Allied Consular representatives at Harbin have submitted a unanimous.opinion in a similar sense. The Bolshevists at Vladivostock have received, reinforcements from Irkutsk and Chita. A mission from Moscow, with plenary powers, has also arrived there in order to deaf with the evacuation of cargo, and has prohibited all exports. His Majesty&apos;s Consul, has-taken the matter up with the local Soviet. The Chinese Government has intimated its intention of raising the embargo and. permitting the importation into Russia of grain and. other goods imported through the Customs stations of Manchuria. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at vladivostock points out that such a course would have a serious effect upon the situation.ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.Conditions in Belgium. Accounts of political and economic conditions in Belgium are published in The Times of June 24th and 25th.Germany and, Flanders. German Wireless of June 24th contains a &quot; declaration by the Council, of Flanders &quot; which, (as summarising the German propaganda on the subject) is reproduced in full as follows : &quot;According to a report issued by the Central Flemish Press Bureau, the Council of Flanders adopted at a full sitting the following declaration, which is to be handed to the Governor-General of Belgium. :-  &apos; Since March 3rd, 1917, the day on which the German Chancellor made a formal declaration to our representative stating that the sister nation of Flanders should have the strong and continuous protection of Germany after the declaration of peace, more than a year has passed.  The world is still under arms, and the armies are still lighting with furious bitterness, but the successes of German arms which have been achieved in the meantime make the final victory of Germany appear nearer.    From the very first we have had faith in tlie Germanic race, and we turn to our sister nation in the conviction that in its success  in  the East and upon  the battlefields  of France,   Germany  wiil   not  forget  her   racial   relatives   the   Flemish   people. Supported   by the   strong   development   which  the   conception   of   a   free   and independent Flanders has assumed here since the German ChancelloPs declaration, the Council of Flanders, on Lecember 22nd, 1917, decided upon the independence of Flanders,  aud announced in a formal  manner   the old  aim. of the Flemish movement.    Our Flemish  qoeople is a people disinherited and oppressed.    For hundreds of years the domination of an administration of foreign nationality and culture has almost stopped the beating of the hearts of   our ancestors who once, enriched Europe by their sentiments and power.   Whoever has eyes to see the character of our people aud to know their voices will recognise the existence of a people struggling again to the front and a manifestation of the newly realised strength of the people.   In the meetings for the re-election of the Council of Flanders thousands have urged the rights of their race and of their liberty, while many thousands more have had silently to conceal their hopes because the future before them lies insecure.   In self defence the German army traversed our country as an enemy, but during the course of the war the Flemish people, in spite of the hard times to which the inhabitants have been exposed, have recognised that it was not the German Empire which was its real enemy, but the Belgian. Government.   In spite of the difficult conditions in which  the occupying Power   is   placed,   the  German Administration has allowed the Flemish j)people to develop &apos;&amp; large number of their desires in the field of language, in the schools and in their administration.   On the other hand, the Belgian Government (always yhad a disdainful &apos; No ! &apos; in reply to all -the wishes of the Flemish people.   As we hear from the lips of Flemish prisoners of
war, our brothers are still being persecuted, who desire nothing more than to lie-placed under  a  command  and   led  into  battle  by   one   speaking   their   own language.   We know therefore what the regaining of a position of power by the  Belgian Government  on  the  old  lines means;   even  though at the  peace-table   they  build   a -golden  bridge  of   beautiful   promises, we  Flemish people-cling   to   the   Germans   for   the   protection   of   Flanders.  .. For   us   Flemish people it  would only  bring   Belgian   hatred,  French   disdain  for our -culture,. English guardianship  for our State life,  and  for our economic life  American, capital wdth American control.   At   the mercy of France,  of   England   and of America,  our people would be destroyed.,  its characteristics would be  despoiled,, and its history extinguished.   In this very earnest  hour, we, a  people desiring independence, trust, with Goths help, in our unwavering determination, and upon Germany&apos;s strong will and appreciation of  the  future.   Economically, politically and strategically situated at the door of Germany, Flanders knows that her incie-pendence .... Germany, but that it can only be realised with Germ any&apos;s help. This independence is only secure and unassailable, however, in. the future if die-foundation of our national life  is  political independence,  and possesses its own legislative body, its own Government, and its own legal authorities, thus enabling us to possess our own political, economic and cultural institutions, suitable to our needs, and consequently to the self-determination of our country and people.   Fully conscious of the responsibility to our people, we believe, therefore, that the liberation of Flanders from every Latinised Power means the liberation of Germany from every threat in the west,   ddie community of race, of history, and of self-preservation direct  both Germany and Flanders to the same aim, a free   and independent Flanders.&apos; &quot;   (And see Reports Nos. 52, 54, 59, 65, 70, 72, and 73.)Antwerp and the Campine. A report received emphasises the value to Germany,, from the economic point of view, of retaining the Port of Antwerp and the coalfield of the Campine.FRANCE.French Press and the Kaiser&apos;s Speech-. Referring to recent utterances by the-Kaiser, the Temps declares that the Imperial Conference in London is doubtless considering the question of the distribution of raw materials after the war, and should quickly decide on a definite plan as the French Government has clone. The United States must then take similar measures. Paps and Evmanite urge the immediate-foundation of a League of Nations. Sembat, in Humanite, declares that the Kaiser is clearly heading the Pan-German movement in confidence of victory ; he intimates that there is a lack of coherence in the Allied strategy, and demands that unity of command should, be a reality.Franco-American Co-operation : M: TardiexCs Appointment. Lord. Derby reports-the publication of a decree appointing Monsieur Tardieu &quot; Commissaire General aux affaires de Guerre Franco-Americaines &quot; in France under the President of the Council.. His duties will be to increase in every way co-operation between the United States and France, and with this end in view to take the initiative with various Ministries and Services in proposing measures designed (1) to co-ordinate in concert with the United States Government the work of military preparation accomplished in the United States and its execution in France ; (2) to supply the wants of the United States Expeditionary Forces in France as well as the needs of France in America ; (3) to further in concert with the United States Government, especially in regard to neutral countries, the policy of interallied agreements ; (5) to propagate in allied, neutral and enemy countries information relative to Franco-American co-operation.The Commissioner-General will have under him (1) High Commissioners&apos; offices-at Washington and  New York ;   (2) Central office of Franco-American relations ; (3) American services under the office of missions ; (4) French missions attached to-American authorities in the interior.ddie Aide Major-General under the &apos;Conimander-in-Chief of allied armies charged with. American questions will act as Chief of Military Services of the Commissioner--. General.German Propaganda. German Wireless of dune 20th states : &quot; The British are-considering with equanimity the possibility of a further withdrawal in France, which..
would hot affect the end of the war, since the capture of Calais by the Germans would set free numerous British forces for English shipbuilding and there lore would lie an advantage to England on the sea..&quot; Further insinuations are made that the Americans are not being used to release French troops from the Front, but rather to take the place of French workmen behind the Front and in factories (sea. also Reports Nos. 69 and 72): &quot;The fear is constantly growing in France that A.meriea&apos;s real aim is not to render assistance, but to acquire economic supremacy.&quot; (And sec under &quot;Belgium&quot; and &quot; Denmark.&quot;)And sec under &quot;Switzerland.&quot;ITALY.General Conditions. In a despatch, dated June 9th, Sir lb Bodd reported that the general spirit in Italy then, seemed better than at almost any period since the beginning of the war. The situation on the French and Flanders front had produced no perceptible weakening in public confidence. The prolongation of the struggle was accepted with resignation, and even in regions such as Calabria, where the economic difficulties of the war had been most severely felt, the morale of the people was high. &quot; There is no lack of employment, high wages are being earned, every-where, and subscriptions to the last war loan have been, distributed over a much larger- numerical proportioned the population than in previous loans. Not a little is also due, it is only fair to recognise, to a more active propaganda iu the country and a progressive understanding of the real issues of the war. The prospects of the harvest are rexDorted to be very good, though there may be a diflicuhw in providing sufficient labour to dispose of it. . . . For the present, the perils of a shortage of food should no longer weigh upon the population, though the difficulties of distribution, owing to the deficiency of fuel and trucks, remain as great as ever-.&quot;The Austrian Offensive. Italian Wireless of June 22nd makes the following-observations regarding the Austrian offensive: &quot;From the enemy press arriving via Switzerland it appears that the Austrian plan was long and carefully prepared and was undertaken voluntarily by the Austrian command, who were certain that they would be able to repeat the operations of October last. Militarily and strategically, according to statements of the chief Austrian papers, success was regarded as certain. It is needful to receive with the greatest reserve all reports tending to make believe that Germany forced Austria to engage in the offensive though the latter was not in a condition to do so. It must be entirely excluded that at this moment Austria feels in any way whatever inclined to make a separate peace. From what the Austrian Press writes we may be sure that Austria is more determined than ever to carry on the war against Italy.&quot;   (See cdso Report No. 73. and under &quot; Austria-Hungary.&quot;)And see under &quot; Switzerland.&quot;JAPAN.Arrival of Prince Arthur of Connaur/ht: Presentation of Field Marshal&apos;s Baton to the Emperor. Sir C. Greene reports that on June 18th Prince Arthur of Connaught arrived at Tokyo, where he was met by the Emperor, There were manifestations of public rejoicing, and a very cordial and affectionate welcome was extended by the Press at this, his third, visit, as emphasising the friendship between the two Imperial Houses. Insistence is also laid on the stability of the Alliance and its invigoration by the Mission. One newspaper suggests that friendship with England is the way to friendship with the United States ; another proposes that the Alliance should be expand eel so as to include the United States. The Foreign Minister has declared in an interview that Great Britaihs abandonment of splendid isolation in favour of the Far Eastern &quot;Alliance was a world event, creating a sense of mystic relationship between the two countries : it is a brilliant alliance of peace and justice, ready to join in drawing the sword on the disturber of those principles . . . Japan must not he backward in making yet further efforts in conjunction with her Ally. On June 19th. Prince Arthur delivered a Field Marshals baton to the Emperor at the Imperial Palace, where a State dinner was subsequently given. Prince Arthur has since fulfilled a very large number of ceremonial and social engagements, and has every-where made the best xjossible impression.5873-lb 13
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Socialist Delegation for Europe. According to the Evening Dost (June 20th), a delegation of American Socialists, including Mr. John Sparge, tlie well-known Socialist author, is going to London to attend, the British Labour Party&apos;s Conference on August. 28th. The party will afterwards proceed to France, Italy, and Switzerland, in order to confer with the Socialists in those countries. A statement issued by the American Alliance of Labour and Democracy on behalf of the delegation emphasises America&apos;s opposition to &quot;the whole Stockholm Conference scheme, root and branch,&quot; asserting that nothing can be gained by such conversations about peace at the present time. Any International Congress of Socialists, the statement adds, would first require the unconditional acceptance- by every delegate of the peace terms of democracy, as formulated by President Wilson on January 8th, as also those laid down by the Entente Socialists in. London on February 22nd, and. secondly, any delegations from the autocratic countries must consist exclusively of those actively engaged in the effort to bring about the immediate revolutionary overthrow of their Governments.Minnesota Election. Mr. Bayley reports the results of the Minnesota elections. Governor Burnquist is renominated with a majority of -50,000 over the Non-Partisan League candidate, Lindbergh. In all but one of the congressional districts the Non-Partisan League (see Report No. 7.1) has met with disaster, presumably attribu-table to an increased understanding in the Middle West of &quot;war conditions.British and United States Exchange in South America : German Propaganda,  German Wireless of June 22nd. quotes the Economist as stating that the rate of exchange on the dollar is taking firm root in South America ; and declares that the United States is thus trying, in spite of the Alliance, to supplant the recognition of the rate of exchange on the pound sterling.See also under &quot;France.&quot;ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Tendered Designation of Austrian Gcdii.net. According to Press reports, Dr. von Seidler has tendered the resignation .of the Austrian. Cabinet (for probable reasons see following paragraphs); Kaiser Karl has reserved, his decision, instructing him to carry on his duties for the present.Austria and Cue Poles. The Foreign Office is informed, that the Polish Club at Vienna has decided to oppose the present Austrian Government. This decision is of special significance as having been reached by the parties other than, the National Democrats (who have left the Club. See Reports Nos. 59 and 70). It would appear that the Central Powers are hesitating to put forward proposals in regard to the Polish question, from a fear that they might contrast unfavourably with the Allied attitude as expressed in the recent Versailles declaration (see Report No. 71); at auy rate Austrian official circles are stated to attribute to that declaration the fact that the German Government has not definitely rejected the Austrian proposals. Mean while j both the German and Austrian Governments profess to regard the Allied declaration as mere bluff, and, like the offer of French coal to Switzerland, impossible to carry into execution. It is at the same time reported that there is general satisfaction among Poles at the recent support by the Hungarian Parliament of Polish autonomy, though they recognise the selfishness of the motives which inspired it.Economic Conditions.- According to information received by the Foreign Office, the Austrian people are very weary of the war, for which some of &quot;them regard -the Germans as responsible much more than their own Government ; at the same time the Emperor Karl is generally considered to have ruined his career. Everybody appears listless and haggard. The theatres are full, but the restaurants are empty. A good meal costs 60 crowns. Tn the case of one informant, 12 crowns was paid for a small slice of meat and three crowns for two potatoes. Clothes are. almost unobtainable. There is a considerable amount of shoplifting. Tramways and trains are invaded without payment.   Meetings are frequent at which mob orators
call  upon workers to strike immediately or at any rate so soon as the Western offensive is checked.   Similar conditions apply in   Tyrol, where the peasants are in terrible want and utterly war-weary -anxious, indeed, to give up the Tfentino or anything else for the sake of peace.   Their cattle is ravaged by the foot-and-mouth disease.   At Cracow the bread ration is 50 grammes per day, and this can only be obtained   with great difficulty.     The poor assemble before the   bakers&apos;  shops at 3 a.m.   Meat, fat, and milk are unobtainable except by those who can afford to pay 200 crowns a day.   There are continual tumults   in -which women  take the principal part ; on several occasions, owing to the  inadequacy of the police, the troops have  been called   out  ami  have fired  upon   women  and  children. A Vienna report to the Berliner Tageblatt of June 17th announces-the. redaction of the Vienna bread ration from 1,200 to G30 grammes per week per head, that is to say, to 00 grammes per head per day.   A Vienna telegram of June .19th records a protest made on the 18th by the City Council against this measure.   The Vienna Labour Council passed a resolution   insisting   that   no substantial   and   lasting improvement in food conditions was   possible   so   long as   the Avar&apos; continued ; it renewed  its  demand   for a  speedy general  peace.    A  Vienna  telegram  of June 20th states that the Austrian Premier received various representatives  of the Vienna Press on the 19th and. made the following . statement : &quot;The Pood Minister,   Dr.   Ludwig   Paul,   has   during   the   last   few days been  conducting negotiations Avith the German Government about Austria&apos;s food difficulties, which are due to the fact that the imports from the Ukraine and Bessarabia have not been forthcoming.   The German. Government has declared, itself ready to advance Austria a certain quantity of grain, and some hundreds of wagous are ready en route from Germany.   Germany has thus again, proved its fraternal attitude in the Alliance-Through the assistance rendered by Germany., the supply of food to Austria, though scanty, is rendered possible, but, for the present, the restriction of the bread allowance for Vienna cannot be removed.    The Hungarian Government has also declared&apos; itself ready to alleviate the situation of Austria by sending foodstuffs, especially considerable quantities of new potatoes.   The readiness of Germany and Hungary to assist will alleviate the short period of hardship and endurance before .the new harvest.   The population Avhich has displayed wonderful patriotism during the entire Avar, Avill certainly also put up with this last transitory restriction in the spirit of sacrifice, and thus contribute to the successful termination of the conflict that has been forced upon us.&quot;Unrest in the Provinces. According to&apos; a report received by the Foreign Office, much unrest prevails at Lemberg and in several parts of the province risings have taken place. Organised demonstrations are being made in all parts of the Empire where the Czecho-Slovaks, &amp;c, are in a majority, with the object of compelling the retention of Austrian troops in the interior. Recently, such troops  although Austrian-Germans have on several occasions refused to use force against the croAvd. A. revolution by the Czechs and Slovaks could probably at the present time be suppressed by the Hungarians with Prussian help, but, if the German military power shows signs of weakening, there is a likelihood of a great revolutionary movement in Austria.The Austrian Offensive. According to a report received by the Foreign Office the Austrian failure on the Piave is being attributed by Austrians to the refusal of Hungarian troops to continue fighting except in defence of Hungarian territory. The Hungarians Avere further irritated by the fact that the only battalions contributed by Germany Avere Requisition Battalions detailed to claim on behalf of the German Army booty captured by the Austro-ilungarian forces. According to another report the attack has been principally entrusted to Hungarian and Tyrolese, owing to the refusal of the Slavs to fight.   (See also under &quot; Italy.1&apos;)GERMANY.Criticism of the Kaisers War Aims. Criticising the KaiseFs speech on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of his accession to the throne (see Report No. 73), the Frankfurter Zeitung of June 1.7th observes : &quot; The German people Avas not told on August 4th, 19.14, that it Avas going out to fight against a certain view of life until, this Avas unconditionally conquered. If that had been said, even in the most veiled form, the unity of will of the German nation, would lnure been torn to pieces the very first day.  Further, it must be said that there is something very revolting in attributing
to two whole nations certain views of life. We dispute that people should be expected to interpret the limitless misery of this war in such a manner. It is too astounding that the Emperor should pick out the English from all his enemies as specially despicable in their views of life. lie has been often enough to England, and has not seldom given free expression to his sympathies for English life.&quot;Germany and the Ukraine. The Eoreign Office learns that the Germans are adopting drastic measures for clearing the Ukraine of foreigners, and that they have already arrested the Greek and Spanish Consuls at Kieff, together with their staffs. It is stated that the Germans were welcomed by the local nobility and the Jews. The latter are for this reason veiy unpopular with the peasantry, whose hatred for the Germans is indescribable. Owing to the seizure by the Germans, without payment, of the wheat stocks, the peasants are now determined to produce as little corn as possible. The towns are suffering greatly from want of food, rolling-stock is in a shocking condition, and the permanent ways are not properly maintained. The Austro-Germaus are running three expresses daily with German plant one to Warsaw, one to Odessa, and one to Austria. Imperial roubles have disappeared, and neither Kerensky&apos;s nor Ukrainian money has any value.(airman Economic Expansion in Russia. -A statement is published by Brpnsky on behalf of the Bolshevist Government declaring that the Soviet has been obliged to make a loan to settle the Brest obligations. In order to raise money in Germany, concessions of Russian natural wealth have been necessary, namely, petroleum, railways, agriculture, artificial manures and gold mines.Economic Policy. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4887), dated June 14th, the Political Intelligence Department discusses various recent German pronouncements on economic policy.British Air Raids. A further report has been received by the Foreign Office as to the terror inspired amongst the population of Western Germany by British air raids. It is stated that many well-to-do people wished to withdraw into Central Germany, but were not allowed by the Government to do so on the grounds that it would spread panic and also interfere with the arrangements for food distribution.Hardest IJrospects. From reports received it appears that the German potato crop is likely to be both earlier and better than that of last, year, and the same can be expected of cereals. It would seem, &quot;however, that in Schleswig-Holstein the lack of fertilisers is diminishing the yield of the soil. In Alsace-Lorraine agriculture has been practically ruined by the general requisition of 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of cattle at very low prices, and by the seizure of crops and insufficient supply of seed potatoes.NEUTRAL GROUP.BOLIVIA.Enemy Exports. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading to draw the attention of the United States Government to reports that a &quot; cloak &quot; syndicate in Bolivia is receiving licences to export to the United States tin and wolfram of enemy origin, to the great disadvantage of British exporters and apparently in rjrejuclice of the scheme contemplated (sec Reports No. 55 and 58) for British-American acquisition of enemy-owned mines in Bolivia. - .  -CHILE. (See under &quot; Bern.&quot;)DENMARK. .Danish-German Commercial Negotiations.  The Foreign Office learns that German delegates are expected to arrive in Copenhagen on July 7th for negotiation of a four months&apos; agreement with Denmark to date from August 1st.Supplies to Motor Cars.  SirlLBaget reports that the German Legation in Copen-hagen, learning that the British Legation had prohibited the supply of tyres to motor
cars of German origin, lias expressed the intention of forbidding the use of German or Austrian benzin, in any motor car of allied origin. As this would involve the cessation of.practically all. motor traffic, and as the Germans are under agreement to supply benzin up to the end of July, it seems unlikely that the German threat can be enforced at present, if at all.Danish Shipbuilding. The German Government is stiffening tlie conditions under which it will supply shipbuilding materials to -Denmark. It now demands that (1) vessels constructed with German materials must lie up for the period of the war, and (2) the Danes shall give Germany the right for live years after the war to charter such, vessels at current rates, with, the option of purchase at any time within that period. So far the Danish shipbuilding firms have unanimously refused to accept these conditions, thereby following the example of the Norwegians. (And see Report No. 08 ; also Reports Nos. 69 and 73 under &quot; Norway.&quot;)Tro-German Propaganda. German Wireless of June 19th and 24th quote strongly anti-Entente articles from die Copenhagen Finans Tidende. The first is a comparison between British and German, exports to Denmark:-&quot; Germany supplies large quantities of coal, iron, petrol, salt, potash, &amp;c, so that Danish industrial life has not quite come to a standstill, thanks to German imports. The English are forced to an exchange-trade in all sorts of wares, because their valuta has dropped to an alarmingly low level.&quot; The second aims at inciting French opinion against Great Britain, the United States, and the Clemenceau Government : &quot;Amidst the battle which the British and American telegram bureaus are waging against German expansion, France is bleeding to death. And in France itself there is always the same little clique of politicians with despots at its head; it is unshakable and rules the whole of the foreign and home policy, as well as the opinions of the telegram bureaus and the Press. In any country a single man, supported by military force, can arbitrarily impose his will on everybody.....&quot;Transit Goods. Regarding transit goods in Denmark, Sir II. Paget makes a submission similar to that put forward by Sir M. Findlay in respect of such goods in Norway (see under &quot;Norway &quot;).Iceland. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4938), dated June 22nd, the Political Intelligence Department reports a speech by Jon Magnussou, Prime Minister of Iceland, on Icelandic Independence. Speeches on the same subject by the Danish Premier and the Danish Liberal Leader are also summarised (and see Reports Nos. 50, 54, 67-71 and 78).FINLAND and ALAND.Finland and the North. : Anti-Ally Feeling. The Foreign Office learns that a party of White Guards has arrived near Boris Gleb. It is reported that a German Force has gone to Eajani, and that a light railway is being constructed from there to Kern. It is also stated that a road is being made from Rovariiemi to Kaudalakasha, and that telephonic communication is being arranged between these points. Enemy forces amounting to several thousands, fully equipped, are being moved in the direction of Ladoga, possibly against Petrograd, but most probably with the object of cutting the Murman Railway. Mr. Wardrop reports a rumour in Moscow of a secret treaty between Germany and Finland by which Finland is to form an army of 100,000 men to lie used by Germany against Russia in the event of Russia resuming hostilities. The Germans are making surveys apparently with a view to a (campaign in the autumn against Murmansk, and have ordered 10,000 sledges for delivery at the end of the summer. Such a campaign is openly discussed in Helsingfors. The Finnish Press is stirring up the people against the British by allegations of British co-operation with the Red Troops at Murmansk. President Swinhufvud has declared to an interviewer that the two main points in his programme requiring immediate settlement are the establishment of a monarchical regime and the creation of a Great Finland. &quot; The second problem was urgent, for actual conditions were most favour-able for a prompt solution. Finland would become a kingdom and naturally gravitate towards Germany. Moreover, Republicans would agree that this orientation arose not only from gratitude for German help, but to preserve Finland from an eventual revanche on the part of a regenerated Russia. The President indicated the new frontiers of Finland as follows : From Lake Ladoga to the mouth of the River Onega58? a-u C
in the Gull, of Onega on the White Sea. Naturally the Kola Peninsula-must belong to Finland. Russia has ceded it; so that England was encroaching not on Russian but on Finnish territory. Finland desired peace with all the world, but had decided if necessary to enforce her right by every means.&quot; Mr. Grove and&apos;the French Consul, at Helsingfors contemplate the possibility of a rupture of relations between Finland and the Allies in the near future.Finnish Army. ddie Kreuz Zeiiuny of June 3rd records the appointment of General-Major Wilknian in succession to General Mannerheini.Arrest of Russian Subjects by Germans. Russian Wireless of June 22nd records a protest by the Bolshevist Government against the arrest by the Germans of Monsieur Kameneff in Finland. The Germans agreed to his release provided that six Finns arrested at Petrograd should be permitted to return to Finland, ddie Bolshevist Government objected to fids condition, but was prepared to consent provided that the Germans would release not only Kameneff but also Wool if Savitzky, who was arrested at the same time.Aland--Social Demohraten of June .1.8th states that negotiations regarding the demolition of the Aland fortifications (see Report No. 68), are to be Carried on in Stockholm between representatives of the Swedish, Finnish and German Governments.NETHERLANDS.TAniburg Railway Traffic.-^-A semi-official communication issued to the Dutch Press (June 1.8th), with reference to the fear which has been expressed that control over the transit by train through Limbing via Venlo, Vdodrop, Rperi.ho.ncl, Weert, and Bud el to Belgium and back is inadequate, states that this fear is absolutely unfounded, and continues: &quot;ddie trains in question are thoroughly examined by Customs officials atDahlheim and Mamont before being admitted into Dutch territory. Afterwards they are examined by the military authorities at Vlodrop and Buclel before permission is given them to pass through.   At Venlo every incoming train is first examined by the military at the frontier, after which it is allowed to proceed to the railway station at Venlo.   There again the traiids contents are closely examined by a control, officer and Customs officials before authorisation is given to proceed. The number of trains coining from. Belgium to Germany has also been exaggerated, seeing that in no case are more trains allowed through than is compatible with the undisturbed working of the Dutch, railway service,  which at present is  pretty extensive on the line Roermond-Weert. for the transport of Limburg coal.   At present about 22 Dutch trains go in both directions, as against 10 German,   ddie service arrangements reckon with a possible increase of German trains to 2-1 trains per day, but this is in any case to be the maximum,   if the trains go via Venlo their number is deducted from the maximum which can be allowed to go via vlodrop.   Prior to the war the number of trains destined for transit on this latter section was about 2d eacdi way. while the nnmber of Dutch trains amounted only to eight or nine.   The arrangement t now made with Germany is such that the transit of trains may not exceed the peace level. Sir W. Townley reports that the amount of the traffic has been exaggerated in the Press.    Up tiil June 15th, live trains per day was the maximum traffic from Germany to Belgium, and of this, one Only was passing via Venlo.   ddie Netherlands Foreign Minister has declared that the traffic will be limited to a maximum of 2d- trains per -clay in each direction (corresponding to normal peace time traffic),   ddie goods carried have hitherto included sawn planks and beams, cement, barbed, wire, hay, straw, pulp and heather.   So far no sand or gravel has   been  transported,   but any amounts transported later on will be counted in the agreed annual total of 1,600,0JO tons. This total is to be calculated as from the end of last April, and apparently is not to include   the 370,000 tons arranged  for carriage   between  September  loth   and November 15th last.   Although, however, arms, munitions, military equipment and aeroplanes are not to be allowed in transit, and the German Government is stated to have given an assurance that foodstuffs passing will not be used for the Army, the Netherlands Foreign Minister declares himself unable to guarantee that goods passing-over the Roermond railway will in no case be used for military purposes, or that the Netherlands  Government  can  make  transit of  goods not  specifically  excluded conditional upon their being destined for exclusively civilian purposes.   This attitude is in contradiction to the representations put forward by Sir W. Townley on April
29th and the Allied Ministers are protesting to the Netherlands Foreign Minister accordingly.   (And see Reports Nos. 07 and 73.)&apos;Projected Convoy to Dutch East Indies. -Various reasons for the despatch of the prospective convoy to the Dutch East Indies (see Reports Nos. 70-73) are suggested by Sir W. Townley. According to the Netherlands Foreign Minister, the object is avoidance of delays and possible detention in some British port of call. The Minister has admitted the expensiveriess of this expedient. Another suggestion is that the Dutch are adopting this method to get over the German-refusal to permit an)7 ship to leave Holland unless another arrives to take its place. Sir &quot;W. Town-ley considers that the scheme has been adopted merely to satisfy Dutch pride. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir \V. Townley to insist upon the exclusion of alt German dye-stuffs from the cargo of the Noovdam, and to request from the Netherlands Foreign Minister an explicit assurance that the remaining cargo contains no item of enemy origin or owing more than 25 per cent, of its value to enemy labour or materials. Sir W. Townley reports that the deferment of the expedition is causing much discussion, and that the Netherlands Government is generally criticised as having occasioned a humiliating situation.Commercial Negotiations with Belligerents. Sir YV. Town-ley learns that the Netherlands Government is unlikely to conclude any arrangement with the Allies before the result of the elections is known, he, early in July. There is reason to believe that difficulties have arisen in the negotiations with Germany. At the same time it is doubtful whether in the present complication of domestic politics the result of the elections would be affected by negotiations with either of the belligerent camps. German Wireless of June 19th and. 20th refers to the German-Dutch negotiations regarding sea traffic between Holland and Scandinavia, and intimates that arrangements will shortly be made under which shippers of goods from Holland, to Scandinavia will obtain free-conducts by submitting a written sworn declaration, and that consignees are to sign a sealed declaration of responsibility which must be certified by the Chamber of Commerce. Sir \V. Townley, however, reports that satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Netherlands Overseas Trust, regarding goods to be imported from. Scandinavia on Dutch vessels, and that discussions are proceeding with the Trust regarding exports from Holland to Scandinavia.NORWAY.German Negotiations for a, Loan. The Foreign Office learns that the Germans are negotiating in Norway for a loan of 30,000,000 crowns.Limitation on. Contracts for Export. The Norwegian Press reports that a law has been passed in secret session, making the permission of the Ministry of Commerce necessary before legally binding contracts can be made in respect of export of goods which are to be delivered wholly or in part later than six months after date of contract. The sale of ships, and contracts or options for building ships, are included, A fay peiisons&apos; who have concluded such contracts already are to be reported to theMinistry.Proposed Reinsurance of Norwegian Vessels trading in American Waters. Sir M. Findlay transmits the suggestion of the Norwegian War Insurance that, in cases not already provided for, Norwegian vessels trading between North and South American, ports and on the east coast of North America should be re-insured against submarine peril.Transit Goods. With regard to the proposed arrangement between the Swedish and Allied Governments as to the disposal of transit goods in Sweden (see Reports Nos. G6, 09, and 70 under &quot; Sweden&quot;), Sir M. Findlay submits that consideration should be given to the prior interest which the Norwegian Government may express in respect of such transit goods as are still in Norway. (And see Report fNo. 68 and under &quot; Denmark.&quot;)Specific Embargoes raised. In. consequence of the conclusion of the Norwegian-American Agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government has raised embargoes specifically imposed upon various commodities imported from overseas; these include hides, leather, tanning materials, nickel manufactures and nickel compounds, eggs and albumen, jam and soap.
Anxiety regarding British Provision of Aircraft to Chile. The Foreign Office, learning that the prospective provision by His Majesty&apos;s Govern merit of aircraft to ( File (by way of compensation and part payment see Report No.- 73 under &quot; Chile &quot;) is still contemplated with apprehension in Peru, has informed Mr. Rennie that His Majesty&apos;s Government relies upon South American opinion to strengthen the efforts, which the Allies are now making, towards an enduring peace, and. that it would jegard with horror and as a world-calamity the settlement of future controversies between the friendly Republics of South America otherwise than hy peaceful arrangement.SPAIN.German Propaganda on &quot; Self Determination and Freedom of the Setts.&quot; German Wireless of June 22nd observes : Whilst discussing the speech of the Spanish Prime Minister- regarding the military and State policy of Spain, the Norddeiitsche Allgemeine Zeitung recalls that Sehor &quot;Maura once before during the world-war dared to raise the question of Spanish policy and of national honour and to speak openly of an English Gibraltar on Spanish soil. Maura then said (he was not then Prime Minister) that Gibraltar was a painful spear in Spanish flesh. This feeling, says the Norddeutsehe AfXgemeine Zeitung, which every good. Spaniard shares, he has&quot; again given expression to now that he is Prime Minister, by stating that the object of Spanish policy is that Spain must regain control over her own&apos;territory. This object would only be attainable if Gibraltar were once again under Spanish sovereignty. When Maura declared that Spain at a suitable moment must make valid her rights, he was putting forth the demand that, the ideal, of the political programme of Spain must be realised in view of the international situation as it has become by reason of the world-war. The newspaper concludes : &quot; The war has brought to the fore two great essential principles, and these are the moral world-demands, namely, the right of the self-determination of peoples and the freedom of the seas. Both of these forbid that a foreign Power, just because it is sole master, shall hold and militarily occupy&apos; and exploit an important place in another country. In his last Reichstag speech, the German Imperial Chancellor, Count Hertling, referred to this logical deduction of principle from the enemies of Germany making use of Gibraltar, Malta and other places by reason, of their domination of the sea, and he declared that Germany would at all times be prepared to support the carrying out of this principle throughout the world. At that time there came from England, as the echo of his statement, a cry of indignation that anyone should, dare even to point out the doubtful right of England to her- world possessions. The speech of the Spanish Prime Minister is a pleasing sign, that the ideas of justice in the world-war are beginning to be properly understood also in neutral countries.&quot;   (See also Reports Nos. 62 and 6-1.)SWEDEN.Swedish-Allied Agreement. The following official communique regarding the Swedish-Allied Agreement (see Report No. 73) has been published in the Swedish Press :-&quot; Since December 1917, negotiations have been taking place concerning a commercial agreement between Sweden of the one part and Great Britain, France, Italy, and the United States of the other part. These negotiations have now led to the result that the Allies have bound themselves to facilitate the successive import into Sweden, in quantities satisfactory in existing circumstances, of the following-necessary goods, such as breadstuffs, feeding stuffs, coal, oils of different kinds, raw rubber, manufactured rubber, cotton, cotton goods, wool, woollen goods and other textile goods, hides, leather, tanning materials, coffee, tobacco, copper, ferro-alloys, tin, tinplates, saltpetre, phosphates, and sulphur, besides a number of other goods required by Sweden. In compensation for this concession, the Allies have principally stipulated that under the period of agreement they will have the right to
hire Swedish tonnage to the extent of 400,000 tons deadweight, of which 200,000 for voyages in the danger zone ; further, that the Allies are assured of a certain proportion of iron ore from Sweden ; further, that, so long as relation between British pound and Swedish crown is as abnormal as at present and this agreement is in force, suitable credit in Sweden, will be granted for the purchase of Swedish goods ; further, that, in conjunction -with the above-named imports into Sweden, certain arrange-ments should be made to prevent the export from this country of the said goods as well as such, as can replace them. in the said 400,000 tons is included 100,000 of those chartered under the so-called -modus vivendi agreement. By the agreement now made, an opportunity is afforded for Sweden without abandoning her neutral position to procure for her population goods indispensable in order that the health of the people should not suffer- from lack of food-stuffs, and required in order that branches of industries of importance to the country should not entirely be stopped owing to shortage of raw material. (In the basis of this agreement purchases have already been concluded regarding consider-able quantities of breadstulfs and feeding stuffs. Bart of these bread stuffs are already on the way to Sweden. Various other goods previously purchased will on the basis of the agreement be immediately released for import.&quot;Sir E. Howard reports that with the exception of Social Demokraten and the Gothenburg Handelstidning, the Liberal papers are somewhat lukewarm in their reception of the terms disclosed, ddie Conservative Press attacks the agreement, and, through it, the Government. (German Wireless of June 21 st quotes adverse criticisms.) Sir E. Howard observes that the persistent Anglophobia of the Conservative Press appears to lie based, upon a confident anticipation of German victory.German Control of Traffic between Sweden and. Russia. According to a report received, traffic between Sweden and Russia is entirely subject to German control. Swedish merchants are not allowed to communicate with branch businesses in any part of Russia unless there is a German interest in the firm. Permits may be cancelled at any point on the journey, even though the bearer may have received a * passport from the Finnish Government to pass through Finland. Officers and couriers are searched, including those carrying diplomatic bags. ddie German Legation at Stockholm requires full particulars of the family and relations of every person applying for a passport. The Finnish Legation admits that it cannot act in this respect independently of the Germans.Transit Goods. Sir R. Paget makes certain recommendations as to procedure in regard, to the disposal of transit goods in Sweden. (And see Reports Nos. 66, 69 and 70 ; also under &quot; Norway &quot; and &quot;Denmark.&quot;)Importation of Supplies from Denmark and Holland. The Swedish Press of June 22nd reports that 25 Swedish railway waggons have been sent to Denmark to fetch a large consignment of meat for import into Sweden. .71.,488 bushels of potatoes are also reported to have arrived in Sweden from Denmark, and 244 tons of salted beans from. Holland.SWITZERLAND.Negotiations for Dutch Tonnage. Lord Reading reports that the United States War Trade Board, while seeing no objection to the conclusion of a mutually satisfactory arrangement between the Swiss and Netherlands Governments regarding the employment of Dutch tonnage (see Report No. 68), deprecates any constructive admission by the Allies of a German right of control.Bolshevist Propaganda. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, Bolshevist Agencies are about to be established at Geneva and. Lausanne for the purpose of organising revolutionary and defeatist propaganda in Italy and France. It is stated that these Agencies are financed with German money. (See also Reports Nos. 69 and 72 under &quot; Italy &quot; ; also No. 71 under &quot; Germany.&quot;)
PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. Tlie outstanding event of the week under this heading is von Jviihl-mantbs speech on. German Avar aims and peace terms, referred 1o under Germany. Reports are coming in about the prospects of Germany&apos;s allies becoming; tired of fighting on her behalf.   (See under Anstria-/Inngary, Turkey, and Bulgaria.)Russia. In a wireless message dated June 22nd, M. Chicherin announced that some of the Russian Black Sea War Vessels had returned to Sebastopol from Novo-rOssisk, &quot; others have been blown up by the crews.&quot;According to a report forwarded by Air. Wardrop on. June Sth (received 20th), the special commission of the Ukraine conference at Kieff approved the principles for the exchange of goods, Russia getting com, coal, metals, and supplies, the Ukraine (Germans?) getting rolling stock. On,lime 23rd, Russian Wireless reported that the frontier question was still being discussed by the Political Commission on June 18th. On June 19th and 20th the exchange of goods was discussed. The discussion followed the lines indicated above (June Sth).Rumania,  On June 23rd German Wireless quoted, various reports, based on questionable authority, about statements attributed to authorities in Rumania about Bessarabia, and alleged inclination, of Rumanian sympathies towards the Central Powers.France,-On Juno 22nd Sir 11. White reported, apparently on reliable authority, that in Morocco the French would let Spain have Tangier if the frontier were adjusted to run to the westward of Cape del Agua, so that the French should gain facilities for establishing a commercial harbour capable of competing against Melilla.Germany. The German object, based upon the Brest-Litovsk &quot; Peace &quot; Treaty, in conducting operations of war to obtain control over the Caucasian oilfields, has been further disclosed to the War Cabinet (W.O. 435). This indicates the German desire to obtain, if possible, a weapon for use in the coming economic struggle.On June 15th (received 18th) Sir II. Rumbold forwarded on good authority reports of the Pan-German objects in forcing the Government, in their peace offensive, to declare an annexationist policy which would cause the Entente Powers to go on fighting. (See under Germany in last weelPs Report.) The Political Intelligence Department, in a memorandum dated June 15th (G.T. 4895), has recently dealt exhaustively with the German peace offensive. &quot; As far as German public opinion.is concerned (at least so far as public expression of such opiniou is permitted, by the Government) it is on one side wedded to the annexationist views of the Kreuzzeilutig ;1 on the other side we have the ideas represented by the Frankfurter Zeitung which looks forward to a compromise.&quot; This compromise assigns to England a position similar to that of Austria in..1866 and 1.871, &quot;England, in fact, accepting the position that she has been defeated by Germany.&quot;According to German Wireless of June 2.1st the Bucharest Treaty discussion would begin in the Reichstag on. that day. German Wireless of -June 22nd gave&apos;a resume of the discussion, not very optimistic about the future.On June 21st German Wireless devotes some space to a discussion in the German Press of Viscount Grey&apos;s recent proposals for a League of Nations. The usual endeavours are made to accuse him of insincerity.These activities in discussion, culminated in von Kuhlmann s speech in the Reichstag, of which reports were given in German Wireless of June 25th. The following summary of his speech is taken, from The Times of June 26th : -In the Reichstag Herr von Kiihlmann, in a long review of the situation, said there was no fore-telling when the war would end, and quoted von Moltke&apos;s prophecy that the next European conflict might last seven or thirty years. A purely military decision could hardly be expected, but as a victory for the Entente was an illusion he hoped their opponents would approach them with peace offers &quot; corresponding&apos; to the situation and German vital needs.The following are the chief points of the speecli :  (1.) Negotiations tor strengthening the Alliance with Austria-Hungary continue. (2) Territorial questions at issue between Bulgaria and Turkey demand a solution, but Germany&apos;s ties with both countries remain unchanged....................     ... .....       ..-------.......... ^.............. ^..................^....................................^------... .1 On June 19th (received 26th) Sir H. Rumbold forwarded information that the Krensxeibmq campaign is a deliberate attempt to force the Government to declare publicly that fchey wish to annex Belgium and Northern Prance. The pan-Germairs, nervous of Ei&apos;zberger&apos;s anti-annexationist campaign, urge the Government to play for all or nothing in the spirit of the gambler.
(55) Independence of Finland achieved with aid of German troops; Aland Island fortifications to be demolished.(4) Partition of Baltic provinces by Brest-Litovsk Treaty unsatisfactory. A conference will be held at Berlin with Bolshevist representatives to attempt to reach a friendly understanding-concerning- pending questions including the status of Pstlionia and Livonia.(5) No solution of Polish question with Austria has yofc been possible.       &apos; &apos;(6) Turkish advance in Caucasia has been stopped. Germany is keenly interested in indepen-dence of Georgia.. Future of Caucasia will, be settled, at a conference to he held at Constantinople!(7) Initiative in the West rests with Germany, but no limit can be fixed tor the duration of the war.(8) In spite of brilliant German successes, no clear desire for peace recognisable among Germany&apos;s enemies.(9) Mr. BalfouVs [declaration [that Germany sought  world domination a legend, which does not become true by repetition. (10) Russia planned the war; Prance instigated it: Britain :l unchained &quot; Russia. (11) Germany&quot;s  war   aims are (a) &quot;the  boundaries drawn for  us   by history&apos;&quot;; (6) &quot;overseapossessions corresponding to our greatness &quot; ; (c) &quot;freedom for carrying our trade on thefree sea. to all continents/ (12) Germany declines to make any statement.about Belgium which will, bind ,ber without  inthe least tying her enemies. (13) A purely  military decision,   of   the   war can hardly be expected, but against  Germany&apos;resources the Entente should realise that their hope of victory is an illusion. (14) The Imperial &quot;Government has not shut the door to an honourable peace, aud will  listen to plain unambiguous proposals;    lie hoped that. in. due course their opponents wouldapproach them with offers in correspondence with the situation and satisfactory to Germanvital needs.The comments in the German newspapers show that Herr von tCiihlmaim&apos;s speech has met with a very divided reception.1-.Aiisbria-llungary. Sir II. Rum bold reported oo June 13th (received 18th) on good authority that the Austro-Hungarian offensive in Italy was postponed in the hope that a peace offensive, combined with. German successes on the Western Front, would induce Italy to make peace.On June 22nd Sir \V. Townley forwarded information, pointing to. an inclination on the part of Austria-Hungary to get out.of the war. Baron. Burian is reported to be ready to agree with the Socialists in Austria on the terms of peace. These conditions are specified, and. involve the revision of the Treaties of Brest and. of Bucharest on the lines of no indemnities and no annexations. The expansion of Bulgaria, is opposed, and a league of nations, combined with disarmament, is favoured.Austrian Wireless of June 23rd publishes a &quot; very urgent &quot; message from the Foreign Ministry to the corresponding department in. Moscow to report the postpone-ment of the departure from Berlin of the Austro-H ungarian special mission (see last week A report), but they would arrive at Orska on Tuesday or Wednesday next.Turkey. Sir II. Rumbold, on June 20th, forwarded reliable reports pointing to friction between Turkey and German)- arising out of the proposed, discussions by German)7 and Austria-Hungary at Berlin with the Russians on the revision of the Brest Treaty.   The question of the Caucasus seems to cause friction.Bulgaria. Sir 11. Rumbold, in. the same message, forwards a report of similar friction between Bulgaria anil Germany over the Dobrudja question. Lord Reading, on June 21st, sent a strong confirmation, adding a report that the failure to give Bulgaria the whole of the Dobrudja may cause her to go out of the war.Great Britain. In the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending on June 19th, it is stated that the agenda for the Labour Party Conference was exciting some conflict of opinion. The Times of June 26th gives the agenda for the Conference on that day.1 Subsequent press reports show that one effectof the speech was to force the aggressive annexationists in the Reichstag into the open.
