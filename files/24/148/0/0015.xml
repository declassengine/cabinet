PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.General Foch. The British and French Governments have agreed to confer upon General Foch the title of Comniaiidor-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in France.Vladivostock. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Vladivostock reports that the Japanese landing party (see Report No. 63), consisting of 200 men, is guarding the French and Japanese Consulates and patrolling the town in small parties. A small party from H.M.S. Huff oik is protecting the British Consulate. There has been no outbreak of any importance, and the population generally is undemonstrative, ddie Zemstvo and the Municipality (who were accused by the Bolshevists of inviting foreign intervention) have formally protested to the British and Japanese Consuls, ddie Soviet, in a vigorous protest to the Japanese Consnl-General declares that there is no belief in the disinterestedness of Japan, and that the landing is a first move towards occupation, ddie Japanese Consul-General under instructions from Jokio has (in the presence of the Allied Consuls) assured the President of the Zemstvo that the landing-was effected for the protection of Japanese life and property, and without any hostility towards Russia ; the parties would be withdrawn as soon as an efficient police force was created. A. similar assurance^has^been given to the Mayor by His Majesty&apos;s Consul. Mr. Lockhart reports that the Allied, explanations are for the present accepted by the Bolshevist Government, which continues, however, to criticise the activities of Captain Semenov (see Report No. 56) as counter-revolutionary. Petrograd papers of April 10th (epioted by the Daily Review of April 12th) state that Chicherin, the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, has informed the Chinese and. Mongolian Govern-ments that the Russian Soviet Governments will regard their relations with the former Russian diplomatists in China and Mongolia as interference in Russian internal affairs, and assistance to the enemies of the Council of People&apos;s Conunis-sioners. The Vlast Naroda, organ of the right wing of the Revolutionary Socialists, which had been suppressed and reappeared on April 7th under the name of llodind (Native Land), states that it looks as if there would be a settlement of the Japanese question, and. expresses its conviction that it is necessary to renew the alliance with all the countries whose interests harmonise-with those of Russia, ddie article blames -Trotsky aucLLenin for using the Vladivostock incident for party ends. Meanwhile the Foreign Office J earns that ben n has been ordering the immediate despatch of munitions, metals, and machinery from Vladivostock to Moscow, and that Bolshevist forces are being assembled near the former town. (See also Memorandum (G.T. 4251), dated April 10th, by the Political Intelligence Department.Proposed Allied Labour Mission to United States. ddie Foreign Office informs Lord Bertie that the United States Ambassador at Paris has been instructed to refuse visas to the Allied Labour Delegates (see Reports Nos. 60 and 63) in the event of their reaching France en route for America. The United States Government does not intend to allow visas to be granted to members of political parties if they are to Lie used for political objects.How Materials. Sir R. Rodd reports the intention of the Italian Ministry of: Industry to appoint a Committee for the purpose of ascertaining the post-war resources and requirements of Italy in respect of raw materials. (And see Reports Nos. 59 and 61.)BELGIUM.Germany and Belgium. The Kreuz-zeitung of April 1.1th, quoted by the Daily Review, states that General Keim, who for 34- years has been.Military Governor of the Belgian Province of Limburg, has made a speech, in Berlin, in the course of which he characterised as a &quot;monstrous idea&quot; the restoration and indemnification of Belgium,

which, he added, &quot;lias only been treated according to the laws of war.&quot; Then, after declaring that hie it von Betlunaun-Hollweg&apos;s admission of the injustice done to Belgium had presented the Belgian question in a false light, he continued :  &quot;The present Imperial Chancellor says that he will be satisfied with guarantees. Such guarantees, however, are but vain imaginings.    So-called military, economic and political guarantees in Belgium are impossible.   The annexation of the Flanders coast, together with the necessary hinterland:, and the conclusion of a German peace with \var indemnities are indispensable.&apos;;&apos;(And see Reports Nos. (.52 and 03.)Belgian Socialism and She Prosecution of the Thar. The firm attitude of. the Belgian Labour Party in the occupied districts is once more illustrated by a resolution quoted in the 1 ndepeudance Beige of March 29th-30th (quoted by the Daily Review) : -&quot; Forty-four leaders of the Belgian. Labour Party in all parts of the country have passed the following resolution : &apos; The party protests against any attempts for a 1 separate peace, which would serve the interests of the last representatives of the &apos; autocracy in Europe, and prolong and increase the sufferings of: Labour throughout &apos; the world ; it sends renewed greetings to workers and peasants in all Russia, and &apos; hopes they will soon restore such union as is necessary to secure the conquests of the &apos; Revolution ; it is waiting Impatiently for the Russian proletariat, which is now &apos; enlightened, by the attitude of the Central -bowers, to understand, that for the triumph &apos; of democracy it is - absolutely necessary (hat new Russia should recover the place it &apos; ought never to have left among modern democracies.&apos; &quot;ITALY.Italo-Slav Entente. Italian Wireless of April 1.1th reports that on April 10th, at an impressive ceremony, in the presence of a great many leading politicians, the Congress of the oppressed nationalities of Anstria-Hungary brought its sittings to a close. Speeches were made by all the leaders of the delegations, amidst enthusiastic applause. M. Trumbic received an ovation from the assembly when he asserted that the Declaration of Corfu of July 1917 bore an historical, character, and registered the will of the J ugo-Slav people to secure unity and to free themselves from the yoke of the Haps burgs.   He said that the foundation had been, laid for an Entente between the Italians and Jugo-Slavs which   would remain concrete, loyal and  close, oven after the war.   Delegate Zamorski declared that the Polish question must be radically and completely settled, that is to sa3r by independence and unity.    For this reason the destiny of Poland is dependent on the victory of the Atlies.   Delegate Boeme (? Czecho-Slovaks) said that the work done by the Congress was ominous for Austria, as would soon become evident.   Deputy Lupu asserted the indomitable resistance of the Rumanian nation.The Congress passed unanimously a long resolution setting forth the aims of the oppressed nationalities in opposition to the Germano-Magyar hegemony, which, is as follows :  &quot; Idle people met together at this Congress declare &quot; (I) Every race maintains its right to constitute its own nationality and unity as a State, and to complete and achieve entire independence.&quot; (2) livery race recognises in the Austro-Ilungarian Monarchy an instrument of Germanic domination and. a fundamental obstacle to the realisation of its rights.&quot; (3) Idie Assembly recognises the necessity for a combined struggle for complete liberation against the common oppressors.&quot; Between the Italian and Jugo-Slav representatives it is particularly agreed &quot; (1) That the unity and independence of the Jugo-Slav nation is recognised as of vital interest to the Italian nation, and reciprocally. &quot; (2) That the liberation of the Adriatic Sea and its defence against all present andfuture enemies is of vital interest for both nations. &quot; (3) That territorial controversies shall be settled in a friendly manner on the basisof the principle of  nationality, and in such a way, to be defined at theconclusion of peace, as not to injure the vital interests of the two nations.
&quot; The Polish problem being also closely connected with the Germanic problem, t lie-Polish representatives added a declaration asserting that they considered Germany to be the principal enemy of Poland. The Poles see in the movement of the people for freedom against the Austro-Hungariau Monarchy one of the principal conditions of their independence from Germany.&quot;[The Daily Review (April 10th) gives extracts from the extreme Irredentist Press (e.g., the Milan Perseveranza) and the Catholic Press (e.g., the Corriere cVItalia)&apos; Opposing the Entente with the Jugo-Slavs.]Food Control. Italian Wireless of April 17th announces that the Cabinet has approved new legislative dispositions for the better organisation of food supplies and distribution, and also to increase the penalties for transgressors against the existing food regulations. A committee will also be formed, with legal powers, for requisitioning. The provisions prove the Governments energetic action to reduce the food consumption to a minimum, and also to secure its better distribution. The Government will form Provincial units for the. supply and distribution of all foodstuffs by means of a State monopoly. These units will have inspectors for tile discovery of hidden hoards, and. these inspectors will be State functionaries, as a better guarantee.PORTUGAL.Allegations against the Government. Sir L. Carnegie, in a despatch dated March 29th, reports the publication in Lisbon of a Paris telegram announcing the discovery of a document (stated to have been prepared for distribution amongst members of the French Government by Senhor Joao Chagas, a Democrat and late Portuguese &quot;Minister in Paris) alleging that the Portuguese Republic is in the hands of Germany, that Senhor Sidonio Paes is really the leader- of a Germanophil ami Monarchist plot, that he is deceiving the Allies, that the Government offices are full of Germanophils, that Senhor Paes is reducing the strength of the Portuguese Expeditionary Force in France, and that the German Embassy in Madrid has placed 2,000,000 marks at the disposal of the Portuguese Government. Special reference is made to the activities of Joao Guimaraes (late &quot; Chef du Cabinet &quot; of Senhor Machado Santos) and A. Tell.es de Vasconcellos (director of the Germanophil paper Liberal). A. letter published, shortly afterwards in an Oporto newspaper by Dr. Alexandre iiraga (a member of the late Government, now in Paris) contains corroborative allegations against Guimaraes and do Vasconcellos. Portuguese newspapers of March 29th publish a semi-official communique from the President, stating that the Government intends to take action (presumably in Parish for libepagainst its calumniators, &quot; thus compelling them to prove their accusations.&quot; The communique continues that the Government, formed entirely of Republicans, has no need to defend itself either at home or abroad against these calumnies, as all its acts, without any exception, have been in. entire, loyal, and devoted collaboration with the Allies and against the common enemy, and it solemnly affirms before the world its intention to continue this policy. Sir L. Carnegie observes that the above-mentioned document and letter are intended by the Democrats to blacken the Portuguese Government in the eyes of the Allies. As regards Guimaraes and de Vasconcellos, it must be admitted that their reputations have been the subject of unfavourable comment.The Electoral Law. It is further stated in the above communique that by the publication^on^dVIarch. 29th of the electoral law (in elaboration of the law mentioned in Report No. 62), the period of the elections opens, and that the Government desires to give all citizens full liberty to make legal propaganda and the power of voting freely. All persons, therefore, who have been imprisoned for more than eight da3&apos;s without any charge being made against them are now liberated (Dr. Costa and many other political prisoners benefit by this provision). All political clubs may reopen, and the publication of all newspapers is permitted, but, the communique concludes, measures will be taken for energetically suppressing auy movements against the public order. . . The provinces, the working classes, and social interests will be represented in the Senate. The more important agricultural, commercial, and industrial associations, the public jservices, and the liberal professions are to have parliamentary representa-tion. The. workman will be represented through associations and syndicates. The election of the President is to be direct and uninominal, and his mandate will have a
minimum duration-of four years. Tlie exact duration will be fixed by the new Chambers, who will also have the power to amend the Constitution. The President is to be the Chief of the A rmy and Navy and to have the power of appointing and dismissing his Ministers and Secretaries of State. (Former Presidents had not any of these powers.) The Chamber of Deputies will consist of 115 members and the Senate of 77. These Chambers, since the Republican regime was instituted, have hitherto had 166 and 75 mem bers respectively.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Austria and Germany : Resignation of Count Czeruin.- As a result of the insinua-tions of Count Czernin (see Report. 63 under &quot; Peace Discussions &quot;), M. clemenceau in an official note dated April 8th. referred to a letter, written in March 1917, by the Emperor Earl to his brother-in-law, Prince Sixte of Bourbon, admitting the &quot;just French claims regarding Alsace-Lorraine.&quot; The Emperor shortly after-wards telegraphed to the Kaiser disavowing with indignation that he recognised such claims. On April 12th the Berlin correspondent of Stoekliolms Dagblad informed his paper that Count CzerninA position seemed seriously threatened, and that his sudden return from Bucharest was probably connected with this. &quot;Telegrams from Vienna lead - us to infer that. Austrian ppl icy is to a certain &quot; extent influenced by that of Berlin, whence it is difficult to expect that Count &quot;Czernin will, be allowed to - fall so long as his policy agrees with that of &quot; Berlin.&quot; On April 15th Sir II. Rumbold reported that, in the opinion of Austrians at Berne, (lie Austrian Emperor had, since the time when he wrote the letter, fallen into the power of the German military party ; they considered it certain that Count Czernin would resign and be replaced by a devotee of Germany. A Vienna telegram of tin; same date announces the resignation of Count Czernin : according to the Vienna correspondent of the Lokglanzciger, &quot;It is asserted that the &quot; existence of the Emperor Charles&apos; letter was unknown to Count Czernin, and that &quot; he is resigning in consequence.&quot; Sir W. Townley learns that. Count Czernin refused to retain office unless Prince Sixte would confirm the emperor&apos;s denial. The Press reports that as a result of special persuasion, the Count has agreed first to settle the conclusion of peace with Rumania. German Wireless reports :  &quot; Count Czernin, who has been dismissed from, office by the Emperor Charles, &quot; has been entrusted with the carrying on of affairs until the appointment of his &quot; successor. The Emperor Charles has sent the following telegram to the German &quot; Emperor: &apos; ClemenceaAs charges against me are .... so base that I do not &quot; &apos; intend to enter into any further discussions with France on the matter. My &quot; &apos; guns in the West will give our reply.&apos; . . . The Conservative journal. Kreuz-&quot; zeitujig says, &apos; Count Czernin, who was a clever politician, has doubtless drawn &quot; &apos; the correct conclusion from the situation, and his attitude was constitutionally &quot; &apos; correct,&apos; and it, hopes that his successor will follow the same objectives as German &quot; diplomacy which, as a result of the military situation, may assume quite another &quot; form, to that which they had during the period of office of Count Czernin.&quot; It is repoVtod that a strong feeling exists amongst Austrians against the growing economic and other influence of Germany over Austrian affairs. As a means to the attainment of such independence, Austrians have been, heard to advocate an understanding with the moderate Czechs and Poles.&apos; In this connection Count OzerniAs recent attack on the Czechs has been criticised as tending to drive the moderate Czechs into the arms of the revolutionary party. The further complaint is made that Czernin has post-poned A ustrian interests to those of Germany and Hungary. Meanwhile the Hhciwisehe Weslfalische Zeitung complains that Austria is getting the lion&apos;s share out of the Treaty of Bucharest. The Foreign Office learns that Professor Lammasch, wdio has been mentioned as giving pacifist advice to the Emperor (see Report No. 61), has become an object of persecution&apos; at the hands of the German authorities. German Wireless of April 17th reports that the Minister of Finance, Baron Stefan von Buriau. von. Rajecz has been appointed to succeed Count Czernin as Foreign Minister, retaining also the Ministry of Finance. Sir W. Townley reports that this appointment and the rumoured reconstruction of the Hungarian Cabinet would appear to point to a victory for Tisza, who may be expected to direct Austro-Hungarian foreign policy towards a closer union with Germany.5481- m B
Supplies from the. Ukraine. Sir II. Rum &quot;bold learns from an Ukrainian source that there are practically no stocks of foodstuffs in the Ukraine, and that there is also .a great shortage of seeds in that country, ddie Foreign Office also learns from a good source that the supply of cereals found by the Germans and Austria us at Kieff and. Odessa was very disappointing. The peasants are unwilling to part with such amounts as they possess, and the Germans are therefore invoking the assistance of Jewish merchants in obtaining control of these. A special correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, who has been travelling through the Ukraine, sends a most pessimistic report to Iris paper of conditions in tfie country. lie says he found the shops and warehouses almost empty and the peasants&apos; stocks depleted, and the best seed corn, being used to feed cattle or for a secret still which almost every household possesses. The outlook for the next harvest, too, is most unpromising, ddie peasants have plundered estates, destroyed farm buildings and machinery, and have stolen, or slaughtered most of the cattle. No labour is available for spring cultivation, and. there are no facilities for harvesting the next crops, ddie Ukraine sugar industry is confronted with ruin owing to the decrease of beet cultivation. The Bolshevist official journal. (April otli) has an article by Kervdientsey. a writer whose revolutionary name was Lebedev, on the situation in the Ukraine. &quot; ddie brutal oppression and exploitation of the Germans &quot; is driving the masses to open resistance, ddie existence of the ilada is only maintained &quot; by the support of German bayonets. Golubovitch and Grushevsky are wretched &quot; marionettes, who will soon be thrown aside, ddie people of the Ukraine must come &quot;to see that it is necessary to collaborate with the Bolshevists against Germany.&quot; Meanwhile German. Wireless of April 11th reports : &quot; ddie agreement regarding the supply of (50,000,000 poods of bread wheat, corn for cattle, legumes and oil seeds by Ukrainia to the Central Bowers was signed in Kieff on April. 9th hy the Ukrainian, German and Au.stroke-klungar.iaii Delegates. . . . Germany and Austria-Hungary have established at Kieff a Mercantile Economic Bureau, which will, take over grain from the Ukrainian commercial, organisations. Nine million poods are to lie delivered in April, 15,000,01)0 in May, 20,000,000 in Juno, and 19,000,000 in July, ddie deliveries of grain have already commenced. . . . ddie economic relations with Ukraiiiia will first of all lie limited to the carrying out of reciprocal State orders. Whilst the Central Bowers are to receive a large amount of corn from Southern Russia, the Ukrainian Rada has placed with Germany orders for the supply of agricultural machines, small, iron, tools, and chemicals, ddie value of the orders amount to about 750,000,000 marks. For the execution of this first great export business the &apos; Aussenhandelsgesellschaft m.b.H.&apos; (Foreign Trading Company, Limited) has been formed.&quot;   (And see under &quot;Sweden.&apos;&apos;). Hungary. -Mr. Sadler reports symptoms of hostility to Germany in Hungary. The latter country, anxious to become an industrial kingdom, is realising the less palatable elements of &quot;Mittel &quot;Europa &quot; and the true inwardness of the &quot; Drang nach Osten.&quot; ddie Government plans for economic relations with Germany inclined to a -system of preferential tariffs rather than to a complete Customs Union. The Press and speakers in Parliament put forward counter-demands for an independent Customs system, Lest Hungary be lowered to the level, of a Bundesstaat, and lest the encroach-ments of German competition necessitate crushing duties on all goods. Prospects abroad are no more reassuring to Hungarian interests. due German-Turkish Commercial Treaty of 19.17, the German plans for Russia, German attempts to force under her control export trade from neutral countries to Central Europe, have created uneasiness and anger. A typical instance of German method is the action of their Legation at Berne in proposing.to the Swiss authorities that all export of silk goods to Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and dbirkey be dependent on transit licence from the German Legation. Another interesting touch is the official denial issued in Hungary that requisitioning of corn is done in the interests of Germany. Perhaps the German conquest of her Allies may yet prove incomplete. Hungary is reducing the flour ration, less drastically than her unhappy neighbour, but quite drastically enough to raise from the dds/a Press a howl against .&quot;Hungary&apos;s greatest tyrant the Austrian stomach.&quot;Central Powers&apos; Economic Control over Turkey.-- The Foreign Office learns that the interest on the Turkish Government debt now amounts to about 35,000,000 Turkish pounds per annum. Negotiations for handing over forests, mines and certain railway concessions to Germany and Austria are actively iii progress. Apart from the monopoly of food supply held by the Committee of Union and Progress in Constantinople,
a company lias been formed at Vienna with a capital of 1,000,000 kr., which will have a monopoly of the export of goods to-Turkey. Thus the Turks say among themselves that their country is condemned to servitude because she is entirely dependent on one home and one foreign, monopoly.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Western Offensive.--At the sitting of the Prussian. Upper House on April Oth, the President, according to a Berlin telegram, made a loudly applauded speech, in. which he said : &quot; The decisive battle is at this moment proceeding. We are proud to lie &quot; Germans Ay-hen we look with astonishment at the successes achieved by German deeds. &quot; The. spirit of the old Prussian Kings penetrates the army, the spirit of Potsdam, the spirit of the .1 loheuzollerus, the University of Prussia, to which, in the long run we &quot; owe &quot;the giant guns,the U-boats, the Wolf, and the performances of the Gam bra i &quot; days.&quot; -He further spoke of the attainment of a peace which would, assure the freedom of the future by means of Germany&apos;s proudest word &quot; victory.&quot; In a long-leading article the Weser (April 14th) appeals to the German Government to throw over the policy of the Reichstag resolution of duly 19th, and openly demands that a policy of annexation shall be adopted. Avhich shall include the French ore territory, the placing of Flanders under German protection, and also indemnities. The article recalls ilethmanu-Hollweg&apos;s statement that a premium cannot be set on the contin.ua-tion of the war by assuring the enemy the same mild conditions at a later date as are possible, at present, and recalls also the recent speech of Count Hertling, in which he stated clearly that he could not give the enemy a charter for lengthening the Avar unpunished.The Foreign Office has, nevertheless, received further information indicating dissatisfaction in Germany with, the results so far attained on the Western front. The generaL attitude in. Berlin is one of nervous enthusiasm. Further heavy losses are thought to be inevitable, since to desist would involve moral disaster (and see Reports Nos. 61-03). It is reported that at a recent meeting of industrial and financial leaders in Berlin the majority Avere of opinion that German commerce was irreparably ruined even if the Army were victorious in the West. Many are stated to be inclining towards this view, which is being actively combated by the Pan-Germans and the Fatherland party. It is added that Ballin and his party have severed their connection Avith the War party, and are co-operating with the Socialists in a movement for peace.German War Aims.- The views of a German of some distinction, optimistic as to Germany&apos;s prospects in the war, are reported, to the Foreign Office as follows : In the probable event of victory, either Germany would encourage a Bolshevist move-ment in Western and Central Europe and would then come forward as the saviour of monarchical institutions, or she would at once assert her primacy in the East and ths West. Germany&apos;s plan, in the event of success, is to create a chain of vassal Statee on. her northern, eastern and southern borders, including Finland (to whom the Aland Islands will, be assigned), Lithuania, Poland, the Ukraine, Rumania and the different States of the Austrian Empire, whose sway would be nominal only. Italy will inevitably gravitate to Germany, the pro-German sentiment in that country being very strong and including such diverse elements as the Vatican and Socialism. Turkey Avill be entirely Germanised and the provinces she has lost in the course of the Avar will be restored to her normal rule while in reality under (lerman domination. As regards the West, Germany will, if successful in the present battle, push her efforts as far as Paris and Calais. She Avi.ll also endeavour to effect the reconquest of Egypt. Germany is not attracted by dreams of annexations in Siberia, and contemplates coming to terms with Japan, whereby the latter Avill gain possession of that vast area in exchange for a political agreement in respect of Western Asia. The conquest of Egypt Aviil cut off the British commutii-cation with India, but any scheme of conquest in regard to the Indian Empire is left - for future wars to determine. As the Baltic will become a German sea it necessarily follows that the Scandinavian kingdoms will fall under the tutelage of Germany, though in a lesser degree than the vassal States of which, she contemplates the establish-ment as above.    These vast schemes of conquest and absorption will be amply
provided with raw material and will be completely independent of the continents of North and South America with which she will have no further concern. The commercial penetration of neutral and even of enemy European countries is proceeding rapidly, thanks to the corrupt activities of national agents in countries at Avar Avith Germany. Victory on the Western front will render the evacuation of Belgium and Northern France by Germany an impossibility and will greatly jeopardise the independence of the Netherlands. Should the present offensive fail Germany Avill he able to carry on an offensive Avar for many years to come. She is amply provided with foodstuffs, and the hope that, she may be brought to her knees by means of an economic blockade is a chimera ; while to expect salvation from, a democratic reaction of Germany would be to court bitter disappointment.German Policy in Russia. The Foreign Office has received information indicating that Germany is anxious to prolong the present anarchy in Russia, in order that by a policy of continued requisitions she may husband her finances for an economic offensive after the Avar. For this purpose she is stated to be Avorkiug in concert with certain Bolshevist leaders.German and Austrian Socialist: Deserters in Russia. Mr. Wardrop reports that, while German and Austrian officer prisoners are daily returning from Russia, the soldiers are unwilling to do so. Many are joining the Bolshevists, and some of these imitate the Russian soldiery by tearing off their officers&apos; shoulder straps (and sea Report No. 62). Sir J. Jordan learns that Austrian prisoners are being refused permission to return to their country. At a recent meeting of prisoners, enemy officers threatened that any prisoner suspected of Bolshevist proclivities would be shot on arrival in Austria.German Commerce with and through Riissia.-Mr. Wardrop reports (April 7th.) the expected arrival at Moscow of a large German Commission to arrange with the Soviet about future commercial relations. By the terms of the treaty such relations include an obligation to assist German trade with Persia and Central. Asia by allowing transit duty free through Russian territory or from Russian Ports. - -Russian and German Diplomatic Appointments. German AV.ir,eless of April. 14th informs the Bolshevist Government of the imminent departure of Count Mirbach for Moscow as German Ambassador, ft also promises the liberation of M. Sagorsky (see Report No. Go) from the concentration camp.Russian Prisoners and German Man-power. Mr. Muller reports : The man., question in Germany, as in all other belligerent countries, is becoming more and more the principal factor both in industry and agriculture, and it is not surprising to learn that manufacturers and farmers are dismayed at the mere idea of an exchange of Russian and-German prisoners of war. Russian prisoners supply a large.proportion of the available male labour on the land, in -mines, and in factories, and their loss would be severely felt. The agrarian Press goes so far as to say that this yeaPs harvest will be ruined if the Russian prisoners are released before the autumn, and some newspapers even suggest that the whole male population of the occupied, territories ceded by Russia should be transported to Germany in order to supply the farmers with cheap agricultural labour. As a matter of fact, it is highly improbable that any large number of Russian prisoners of war will be allowed to leave Germany until the final conclusion of peace, while the German prisoners in Russia will doubtless be used to good purpose to intimidate the native population.Germany and tlie Poles. German Wireless of April 10th and 11th reports a great political Polish debate in the Prussian House of Lords in connection with the proposal that the Government shall ensure that in the proposed agreement regarding the establishment of the future frontiers of the Polish Kingdom the military safeguarding of Prussia shall be the inflexible foundation for all negotiations. The Prussian Minister for Agriculture, von Eisenhart Pothe, said : &quot;The proposal corresponds Avitli the fundamental&apos; standpoint of the Prussian Government. The historical importance of Ostnfark as a buffer against the invasion of foreign PoAvers must not be forgotten. The solidarity of our Eastern frontier is the foremost of Prussian interests. On the occasion of the negotiations regarding these frontiers Prussia must insist that her military interests be regarded as of prime
importance. The Germans and the Poles are;:forced to live together in a coinnion State. In consequence. there., is often mutual pressure,, and. ,u&apos;n/ortunately- the pressure originating with,; the Poles is usually the stronger. - Therefore the 1 task of the Prussian Government is the positive promotion of Germanism iu Qstmark.&quot; The Minister pointed out that the means employed in settling disputes should never be oppressive. No contest should be waged for the purpose of destroying the opponent, but merely for the purpose of restraining- him within proper limitations. Therefore the formula for a practical Polish policy is the further strengthening of Germanism so far as it is compatible with this principle, combined with a prudent attitude of appreciation towards the wishes of the Poles. . . . After a conciliatory speech by Prince Pad.ziw.ill, the Prussian Minister of the Interior, Drews, declared that the Government pursued no other object than that of increasing the number of Poles living on Prussian soil during the mighty world war. For the bringing about of this object, the Government was once more holding out the hand of reconciliation. If the overwhelming majority of the Polish, people continued, to think in the same way as some Deputies in the Reichstag and the House of Deputies had spoken, all the labour of love would be in vain.Mr. Wardrop learns that the Polish population of Warsaw is exasperated by German domination. There is also a strong anti-German feeling among the soldiers of the Polish Corps. The Leipziger Volkszeitung (April 5th) says that the Polish civilians working in Germany before the war are forcibly kept there and have never been, permitted to leave the country since, or given any opportunity of seeing their families, which is one of the main causes of the present friction between Germany and Poland.   (And see next paragraph.)Germany and the Jens.  In a review of Turko-Geriuan policy in its economic, territorial and Zionist aspects (Kreiizzeilung of March 20th) Otto Hoetzsch points Out that of the 14 million-lews in the world more than six million live in Russia and that Germany is confronted by an Pastern Jewish problem, especially in regard.to Poland (Daily lieoiew, Enemy Press Supplement, of April .1.1th). The Foreign Office learns that the Germans are instilling into the Jews of Eastern Europe the belief that British Zionism, is designed to Christianise the Jews in Palestine.German Food Supplies. Mr. Midler reports : &quot; Judging from the German Press in February it is clear that next to their anxiety regarding the chances of material relief from the Ukraine, the two most important epiestions occupying the minds of the authorities and. the public are, first, what are the prospects that existing supplies will suffice till the autumn, and second, what are the prospects that the next harvest will bring any relief from the present stringency ? As to the existence of that stringency there is no manner of doubt. Stocks are low ; imports are non-existent; there is constant competition for available supplies between the consumer and the producer, and between civilian and military needs. Thus, the oats harvest is admitted to have been disastrous, and the other grain crops, though somewhat better, to have been far below the normal requirements for bread and beer manufacture; nevertheless, military necessity dictated that a large portion of the grain raised should be diverted to fodder use. This in turn has led to an enhanced demand for potatoes the only available substitute for human consumption, and a consequent reduction in the amount left over for fodder, pig food, and distilling. Similarly, the scarcity of animal oils and fats made the employment of a substitute in the people&apos;s dietary imperative, and. has led to the diversion of large quantities of vegetable and other oils from industrial purposes, where they were greatly needed, to the manufacture of margarine for human consumption. Nothing has more conclusively demonstrated the endless chain of close interdependence -between all the articles entering into the food economy of man and beast, and. the intimate connection between food and industrial economy.&quot; German Wireless, of April 17th reports optimistically on the economic situation in Germany, and concludes : &quot; The definite &quot; statement made by the State Secretary of the War Food Supply Department, &quot; von Waldow, on April 12th, in the Committee of the Prussian House of Deputies, &quot; to the effect that Germany, without strain or anxiety, will be able to hold out &quot; until the next harvest, has strengthened, the confidence of the people. The &quot; speculations of the Entente Press as to the economic breakdown of Germany &quot; will once more be shown, to be deceptive.&quot;
Posl-War Economics.-Mr. Muller reports &apos;&quot;     &quot; &apos;;&quot;So far as it lies in her own ppweiv Germany,is straining, every neyye to assure,, for &quot;her commerce the &quot;prompt resumption of overseas trade on a large scale, and on terms of equality with her enemies. Huge trusts are being, formed under Govern-ment control in the various branches of industry, and these will be in a position to buy and sell in the markets of the world on especially advantageous terms, ddie rebuilding of her mercantile marine is being pushed forward with the utmost energy, and. no opportunity is lost to advertise the excellence of her wares, and even to secure an immediate market for them in the countries with which she is still able to communicate. It is evident, too, that the reorganisation and development of the Russian Empire will provide a vast field for German commercial and financial enterprise. We have, however, in our hands an effective veapon against the expansion of German commerce after the Avar, if only trade and financial interests, both at home and in. the Allied countries, will agree, even at the cost of some individual sacrifice, to combine in making the fullest possible use of it, and that is the boycott for a period of years of German trade, finance, and shipbuilding. The Daily Review of the Foreign Press (Reconstruction Supplement] of April 9th, at pages 218-222, sets out the views of various German business authorities upon the effects of economic Avar upon German commerce. Amongst the relative matters discussed are the desirability of an Austro-German Customs Union, the necessity of colonies both for Germany and Austria, and the future of German shipping.Public Insecurity. -Mr. Midler reports :  &quot; ddie Berlin newspapers speak of the growing insecurity of life in the capital, and the daily burglaries, especially of foodstuffs. Men and Avomen have been attacked in the streets and robbed, not of their money, but of their clothes and, shoes, ddie Ber-liner Tageblatt publishes an interview with the manager of an insurance company, who said that his firm, Avas daily notified of some 300 burglaries. Similar con-ditions exist in many large towns in Germany. In Frankfurt the police have been reinforced at night by military patrols, and the Cologne Gazette laments the impossi-bility of providing such patrols in all big towns, especially as an increasing number of crimes are now being committed in broad daylight and in the open streets, ddie robberies of goods in transit by post or on the railways has become so common that the compensation paid by the Prussian State Railways in 1917 for property lost or stolen, in transit amounted to 57,000,000 M., as compared with 4,000,000 M. in 1914, while for similar losses the German. Post Office paid 3,000,000 M. in 1917, as &quot;against 100,000 M. in 1912.&quot;NETHERLANDS.Associated Governments and Dutch. Requirements. -Lord Reading reports that the United States Government has replied to the protest made by the Netherlands Government regarding the requisition of Dutch tonnage (see Report No. 62). After combating the arguments put forward by the Netherlands Government, the Note points out, that the Dutch Avill retain a balance of shipping fully adequate to their domestic and colonial requirements, ddie liberal terms of the Associated Govern-ments are then emphasised, and the offer of 100,000 tons of cereals is again mentioned. It is added that arrangements are being perfected to tender to the Netherlands Government other commodities which it desires for the promotion, of the national welfare and for which it may freely send its ships. Lord Reading reports that the United. States Government has offered, instead of waiting for the Maasdyk and Pdeldyk to arrive from Holland, to ship two cargoes of grain from the Gulf in non-requisitioned Dutch ships lying at Savannah and Curagoa respectively, due Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading that His Majesty&apos;s Government agrees to Hollandia sailing from the United States as soon as a corresponding vessel has left Holland for a United States port. It is being stipulated, however, that Hollandia should load cereals in South America on account of the 50,000 promised. The Foreign. Office instructs Sir W. Townley that Kcnnemerland Avill lie allowed to proceed to the United States or. the Plate, to load grain for Hpllancl provided that prompt clearance Avill be given to a corresponding A-essel now in Holland to be  time-chartered  to  Great Britain for use outside  the  Avar  zone.
Sir &apos;W. Tbwnley reports1 that the lAreigri,,Minister, M^^ stated.,in,,,the,,second chamber&apos; of, the&apos;. States-Genefal,.. on.. April 16th,- that&apos;,the. Dutch . Gj pAAfnmenL was prepared &apos; to accept the&apos; American Governments proposal to send three shiploads of grain to Holland on condition, that Holland sent three ships of about the same tonnage to America. According to the Telegraaf, the Minister said, that Holland must have the certainty that the three ships which leave our harbours will reach America. The Government had reason to assume that, Germany would place no impediment in the way of these ships. It had, however, asked Germany as to her intentions, but had not yet received a reply. The Minister had been informed by the Associated Governments that Dutch ships entering British or American ports alter April 20th would not be seized.Purchases of Gold and of British and French Notes. Sir- W. Townley reports that there has recently been a considerable demand in Holland for British Banknotes and for gold coins including sovereigns. For these high prices are being paid. English and French notes are stated to be sent to the Balkans and the Scuth Russian Provinces -as a circulating medium. It is also said that the British notes are required for the payment of German agents. In any case, notes are undoubtedly being bought for export to or through Germany. The exportation of gold from Holland, is prohibited&apos; (See Reports Eos. 60 and 62 and also under &quot; Norway.&quot;)Food Riots. -Sir W. Towuley reports that riots took place at The Hague and elsewhere in. Holland on April 11th. The Burgomaster of ddie Hague has issued a proclamation forbidding the collection of crowds in the streets. Certain Dutch papers variously allege that British non-commissioned officers took part in the demonstration, and that the demonstration took place before the British. Legation. Both these allegations are untrue.Belgian Relief Commission. Sir W. Townley reports that, the recent trouble regarding exportation of supplies to the Belgian Relief Commission (see Report No. 63) has now been settled. However, should a serious food shortage occur, the Netherlands Government may possibly refuse to permit the unloading of relief ships. There may also be difficulties if the Dutch requisitioned ships are employed for relief work.Food Supply. Sir W. Townley reports an. announcement by the Netherlands Foreign Minister that the French Government has offered to send bread stuffs to feed French children in Holland, and that the offer has been accepted. (And see Report No. 63.)SWITZERLAND.King Constantine. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the Greek Minister at Berne is drawing the attention of the Swiss Government to the continued violation by King Constantino of Swiss neutrality (and see Report No. 56), in regard to which a warning-has already been addressed to the King. The Greek Minister now requests that immediate and effectual action should be taken to preclude any repetition of such -abuses. Meanwhile the King is reported to have ordered the uniforms of a Greek General and a German Field Marshal.Rationed Imports. Sir II. Rumbold reports that the new ration of Swiss imports came into force on April Lst simultaneously with the raising of the Allied embargo. (And see Reports Nos. 51-53, 55, 59 and 63.)Shipment of Supplies. The German Government may possibly accede to a suggestion of the Swiss Government that safe conducts should be granted to American vessels solely employed in carrying Swiss goods, conditionally upon such vessels flying the Swiss flag side by side with the United States flag. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading to invite the views of the United States Giovernment upon this proposal, submitting the contention of the Swiss Government&apos;that the Swiss flag would merely be a distinctive mark, analogous to the Red Cross flag. (And see Report No. 63.) Meanwhile, the Swiss Government is contemplating the purchase of certain enemy ships, a course to which the Allied Governments have in principle assented.

Even so, Swiss exports have con-siderably diminished, and their further decrease would seriously affect Swiss industries. Only manufactured goods, unimportant from the embargo point of Anew, are being so transited, and. Herman markets in the neutral countries&apos; are being-captured.Swiss Negotiations until Germany and the Allies. -The War Trade Intelligence-Bureau reports : It was noted last week that the German representatives appointed to negotiate a renewal of the German-Swiss Economic Agreement were likely to press for a stricter control over the use of German raw material in Swiss factories. The Allies are officially informing the Federal Government that, if the Germans persist in their, demand, a stricter control will, be claimed over Swiss factories. which, require copper, lubricating oil and. other materials from Allied sources, and that the Allies Avill require a total cessation of the exports to Germany at present allowed under S.S.S. Agreement. The Germans are also pressing the Swiss to limit their exports of Swiss produce to the Allies. They threaten to restrict or to discontinue altogether their exports of German coal to Switzerland, unless the Swiss cease to supply the Allies with wood. The Germans point out, that under the recent Allied Swiss Cattle Agreement the Federal Government agreed to limit the exports of Swiss produce to Germany, and. they claim an. agreement on similar lines. The suggestion is therefore made that we should not ask for any new formal agreement in place of the expired Cattle Agreement, but arrange privately with the Swiss that their exports to the Allies of wood and condensed milk, &amp;c, shall be maintained up to the quantities available. The Federal Government invites us to discuss this question at once, preferably at Berne. His Majesty&apos;s Government is recommending this proposal to the French and Italian Governments.   (And see Report No. 62.)NORWAY.Purchases of British and American Notes. Sir M. Findiay reports that since the end of March there has been a. growing demand in Norway for British and American notes, for which high exchange is being offered. Notes purchased are stated to be sent to Germany and Holland, and the opinion is expressed that they are intended to be used for espionage, corruption or propaganda. At any rate some scheme on a large scale appears to be contemplated, as the purchases began simultaneously in all parts of Norway, and also, it is said, in Sweden and Denmark. (See Reports Nos. 60 and 62, and also under &quot;Netherlands.&quot;)Norwegian Air Traffic Company. The prospectus of a company entitled the-&quot;Norsk Ehftfartrederi&quot; i (Norwegian Aerial. Traffic Company) appeared in the Stavanger Afienblad (March 2nd). The idea is to establish a network of aerial routes throughout Norway. It is intended to carry, not only mails and parcels, but passengers.    Proposals are made for an air service between. Stavanger and Aberdeen.SWEDEN.Swedish Negotiations with Allies. The Swedish Press of April .10th reports that at a Cabinet meeting on April 5th, at which the National Economy Commission^, proposal for a reduction of the bread, ration was discussed, the Minister for Agriculture stated that in spite of the grave drawbacks of such a course, he would have felt compelled to urge its immediate adoption, if he did not to some extent, count upon other resources than those considered by the Commission. He referred, first, to the possibility of imports from nearer or more distant countries, and secondly, to the hope that considerable uncleared stocks of cereals might yet be discovered in the country. Sir E. Howard considers this last remark to apply to the recent discovery of about ] ,000 tons of hidden cereals. Sir E. Howard reports that all the Swedish papers of April  10th published&apos; telegrams from Washington enumerating the supplies to be
FINLAND.Capture of Helsingfors by Germans. German Wireless of April 15th reports that German military and naval forces have entered Helsingfors. Russian Wireless of April 12th requests the German Government to facilitate the return of all. Russian warships from Helsingfors to Cronstadt. With regard to the German proposal that ships and batteries at Helsingfors should lie disarmed, the Bolshevist Government declares that it declines all responsibility for any possible disarmament if undertaken by non-Russian armed men. VecJiernie Ogni of April 8th (quoted by the Daily Review) understands that a secret treaty exists between Finland, and Germany which grants to Germany the right to keep her warships in Finnish ports, ddie Swedish Press of April 16th reports the capture of Abo and Mantyluoto.Finnish-German Ambitions. Sir F. Howard learns that a Finnish, artist named Axel Gallen has passed, through. Stockholm in connection with a mission to Berlin for striking a new Finnish coinage. He (or one of his companions) is reported by &quot; Poliliken as having declared in. Stockholm that in dune the White forces would be in Petrograd, which, was their aim. The Finns were at one with Germany in aiming at the creation of. a greater Finland, which would include Russian Karelia, with Petrograd and the Murinan Railway to the Arctic. Finland would thus obtain common frontiers with Germany who would keep Esthonia and Livonia. In this way Germany would get a free harbour in the Arctic. Germany would never give up Aland. New Finland would,be larger than Norway and Sweden together, and next to Germany the leading Baltic Power, ddie futures of Finland and Germany were indissolubly united, and a monarchy under a German Prince would be set up in Finland. Another member of the delegation mentioned a scheme for the militarisation of Finland on German lines. The Swedish Press of April 12th announces the departure of General Mannerheim and his staff for the Karelian front. This fact conflicts with a statement recently made by Mr. Sario, that the operations in Karelia were purely local and not5481-36 nexpected from- Eiigland and America if (he agreement is concluded,- and stating that goods to be received under-the modus&apos; vivendi &apos; were already being loaded. - The&apos; extreme Socialist paper Politiken heads these telegrams, &quot; Entente has saved us from hunger : tonnage agreement would give us all we need.&quot; ddie Conservative Aftovbladet attempts to reduce the effect of the telegrams by reminding its readers of the immense value of Swedish tonnage. Svenshe Handels Tidning reports that negotiations. are proceeding between a Swedish Emissary under the authorities in Kieff and Berlin regarding the import of Ukrainian cereals into Sweden, in,exchange for Swedish agricul-tural machinery for Ukraine. Paper states that Central Powers only claim a portion of the one and a ball: million, tons of Ukrainian cereals officially reported to be available for export, and that the Central. Bowers cannot supply the whole Ukrainian demand for agricultural machinery. (And see under &quot; Enemy Allied. Affairs.&quot;) ft is rumoured, that Baltic A.-lb of Sodertetje and A.-B. Arvika Verken would supply the main part of the agricultural machinery.&apos; ddiese two firms are now amalgamated. Sir E. Howard learns, however, that no hopes are held out by the Central Powers that they will be able to supply cereals to Sweden in the near future; A Wolff communique in the Dutch Press states that Germany&apos;s inability to supply Sweden with foodstuffs does not mean that she would consent to Sweden ceding tonnage to the Entente. Meanwhile the Swedish Government is showing anxiety to conclude an agreement with the Allies, and is endeavouring to induce the German Government to reduce by 500,000 tons its demands for the yearly export of 4,000,000 tons of iron ore (see Report No. 03).Exchange of Lecturers between Germany and Sweden. Sir E. Howard reports that an arrangement has been reached for an exchange of lectures to be given by literary and scientific Germans and Swedes in Sweden and Germany respectively. The originator of the scheme is stated to be Glaus Albrecht, one of the leaders of German &quot;Jugend Bewegung.&quot; A committee has been formed at Stockholm, of which Professor Montclius is chairman.Sweden and the Aland Islands. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4250), dated April 10th, the Political Intelligence Department discusses the Aland question as affecting Swedish foreign and internal, policy.
directed from headquarters. According to Mr. Sario the only settled programme; regardingi the Eastern frontier of Finland concerns the districts south-east of the. &quot;Fasviks river up to the sea. which have long been promised to Finland in return for the Systerbak district ceded hy Russia. Sir E. Howard. learns that the Finnish Government has arranged for a deputation to be sent from Eastern Karelia to request annexation to Finland. Air. Lockhart reports that a Finnish Socialist Delegation has invoked Allied assistance against the Germans in Finland, especially on the Murman front (and see Report No. 63). A Memorandum (G.T. 421.6), dated April. 9th, by the Political. Intelligence Department sets out a defence, from a Finnish point of view, of the German-Finnish Treaty and of the Finnish claims to Eastern Karelia and the Murmansk coast.Anti-Ally Manifestations at fPasa.--Sir E. Howard reports that the Finnish Government has, through its Charge d&apos;Affaires at Stockholm, expressed its most lively regrets at the insult offered to a British officer at Wasa (see Reports Nos. 62 and &apos;63), and has stated that the Finnish officer concerned has been punished. His Majesty&apos;s Government considers, however, that the conduct of Mr. Sario still requires apology.Foreign Subjects In Finland. The Swedish Press of April 1.2th publishes an official announcement by the Finnish. Government, guaranteeing, so long as German troops remain in. Finland, the inviolability of diplomatic representatives, Consuls, and Consular Officers and security as regards life, and property for subjects of foreign States. It is added that such persons as are in the region occupied by Government troops must submit to such measures for safety as the Finnish authorities may consider necessary for operations of war in the districts affected.Recognition. The Foreign Office authorises Sir. E. Howard to issue a declaration promising provisional, recognition of the Finnish Government, conditional upon its obtaining the release of British subjects arrested on Finnish territory by Germans, and giving guarantees for the maintenance of neutrality in.the future. (See Report No. 63.)Food Supply. Lord Beading reports that the United States Government does not propose for the present to proceed, with the facilitation of exports to Finland. (See Reports Nos. 62 and 63.)Scandinavian. Loan to Finland. Stocldiolms Tidning declares that Scandiuaviska Kredit A.-P., Goteborgs Bank and Mallare Provinsernas Bank have granted a loan of 10,000,000 kroner to certain Finnish subjects, and that the Finnish Legation in Stockholm has stated on enquiry that the loan is on behalf of the Finnish. Govern-ment. It is guaranteed by Swedish private persons to the extent of 12J- million kronor.SPAIN.Germany and Freedom, of the Seas for Spain. German Wireless of April 13th reports: &quot; An echo in the Spanish Press with regard to the article reported in the &quot; Koelnlsche Zeitung, concerning the claims of Spain to Gibraltar (sec Report No. 62), &quot; is given in an article in the Correspondencia. Militar, which states as the Spanish &quot;ideals, Gibraltar, Tangier, and the free confederation of Spain, and Portugal for the defence of their common interests, security, and greatness. El Dia states in bitter &quot; tones that to-day Spain must receive permission from a third party not only to go &quot; from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, but also to get into communication &quot;&quot; with the more distant parts of her own house.&quot;MOROCCO.Allies and Spanish influence in Tangier. The Foreign Office informs Sir A. Hardinge that there is no truth whatever in the rumouiAAhat France intends to replace Spain as the controlling Power in Tangier, and that England has signed a treaty with the French Government supporting that intention. It is not known from what quarter these and similar reports originate. Germania of March .17th (quoted in the Dally Review, Enemy Press Supplement, of April .1.1th) makes allegations of Allied designs upon Tangier at the expense of Spain.
. CHINA.Enemy Aliens. The Foreign Office instructs Sir C. Greene to request the Japanese Government to provide the tonnage necessary i&apos;or transport of the enemy aliens ordered by the Chinese Government to be deported.   (See Reports Nos. 57, 5861 and 63.) - ;ARGENTINA.Poisoning of Argentine Livestock. If.eral.do de Madrid, March 26th (quoted by the Daily Revieiv) states : &quot; A cable from Buenos Aires announces that a hitherto &quot; unknown disease among the mules destined for export to the Allies has caused the &quot; authorities to make investigations, resulting in the discovery that livestock has been &quot; inoculated with an unknown malady, the work of German agents, whose object is to &quot; destroy the property of the Allies, and to imperil in the future the Argentine^ &quot; wealth in cattle.&quot;MEN f CO.Trouble at Tainpico. Mr. Cummins reports the assassination oil General Nafarete, &apos; Acting Governor of  Tampico.   Government forces have arrived there from the oilfields, and conditions in the town, though quiet, are somewhat complicated.Maize Supply. Lord Reading reports that Cabrera lias contrived to arrange with the Argentine for the shipment to Mexico of a large quantity of maize under the Argentine naval flag.   (And see Report No. 63.)UNITED STATES.   -Denaturalisation. Lord Reading reports that the United States Government is -about to introduce legislation for denaturalising naturalised citizens.SHIRRING- SITUATION..Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing-ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period April 5th-llth, inclusive, was- LI,088 tons gross, of which 26,223 were British, as compared with 42,288 tons gross, of which 16,121 were British, reported last week.The Admiralty reports a notable increase during March in the daily average of British tonnage damaged, hut not sunk. The use of rescue tugs is having results which are highly beneficial in the direction of salving both damaged vessels and human, life.Enemy Sailings. The Admiralty reports that the number of enemy merchant ships trading between Germany and Norwegian ports has again increased, 24 such ships having arrived at, and 12 having sailed from, those ports. No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam. Right German vessels laden with coal have left Delfzyl for Swedish and Danish ports during tile week ending April 6th.Supply of Tonnage for Coal for Soulk America. The Ministry of Shipping reports that arrangements are being made in conjunction with the United States of America, through the Allied Maritime Transport Council, to meet the minimum coal require-ments of South America in such a way as will ensure that all the &quot;Allied and Neutral tonnage available for this purpose, namely, that ioeing used to lift the South American wheat crop and to take essential cargoes from South America to the United States, will be used in the most economical way. This involves the whole of the coal :require-men ts for Brazil being supplied from the United States, and the whole of the coal requirements of Argentina and Uruguay being supplied from the United Kingdom and South Africa, except about 4-00,000 tons which will be supplied from the United States, this figure being equivalent to the minimum imports which the United States-require from the Argentine.
PE A C F. DISC CSS TONS. -   : y aGeneral.- Further peace discussions are still -in abeyance while the-; main issue is, being fought put in France and Flanders.The Brest-Litovsk Treaty has been ratified by Russia, Ukraine (Kief? &quot; Small &quot; Bada), Germany, and Turkey, but no reports have been received of its ratification by Austria-Hungary, or Bulgaria.The Bucharest treaty has not yet been ratified. Bessarabia is said to have decided in favour of the provision uniting the country with Rumania, but the Ukraine-authorities have demanded that they shall be consulted.The attitude of Bulgaria towards the peace treaties engineered by Germany is somewhat, obscure.Russia. With reference to Mr. Wardrop&apos;s report of April 5th about supervision by Allied Consular representatives of the Peace Treaty between Russia and Rumania (see page 1-1 last vveelPs Report), the Foreign Cilice have informed him that a British Officer who hacPa good deal to do with the negotiations has been sent to Moscow.On April 11th M. chicherin complained by Avireless to Berlin that he had received no reply to his message of April 7th (see page PI last week&apos;s Report; about opening negotiations at Smolensk with the Kief? Government of the Ukraine. [N.B. The negotiations should have been opened on April 8th.] Mr. Wardrop on April 12th reported that the Ukraine delegates arrived at Smolensk on April 9th.On April 11 th M. Chicherin again protested by wireless against the invasion of the province of Kursk by German-Ukrainian troops, in spite of the ratification of the Brest Treaty.On April 13th M. Chicherin informed the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister at Vienna that the Bolshevist Government agree that the Peace Treaty comes into force after ratification.   [No report has been received of ratification by A.ustria-Hungary.]M. Chicherin protested by wireless to Berlin on April 14th against hostile actions by the Turko-Geiinan vessels in the Black Sea against the merchant ships of Russia, a &quot; State with which, peace has only recently been signed.&quot;On the same date he added, that the Bolshevist Government was ready at once to start negotiations upon, questions arising out of the Peace Treaty, and. invited German delegates to Moscow for the purpose. Mr. Gurney, on April 15th, reported on good authority that there would be 115 German delegates, and that, if their conditions about return of prisoners were not complied, with, then the Germans would occupy Petrograd and. would seize.hostages.[See also under Germany.&apos;]Ifiiilamcl. Sir IP.Howard, on April Pith, reported that the Government, having sent &quot; volunteers&quot; to the Eastern Karelia district, were by that means arranging for a deputation from that district to (press for?) annexation. Mr. Wardrop, oil April 1 Ith, quoted from the Official Journal fMoscow) a report that the &quot; Moscow authorities &quot; had protested to Berlin against the Finnish attack on Kem. and asked the Germans to interfere. Failing a satisfactory answer, the Russians with a French-English, detachment would force- the Finns to evacuate Russian territory.Lithuania. Sir W. Townley on April 15th drew attention to a leading article in Weser of April 14th advocating throwing over the Reichstag resolution of July 19th and adding &quot;There is no reason now for opposing the now imminent decision of Livonia and Esthonia to join the German Empire.&quot; &quot;Annexations do not lead to wars of revenge.&quot;In this connection, it seems important to note that on April 16th German Wireless reported an appeal from the &quot; Land Council of the whole population of Livonia, &quot; Esthonia, Riga, and Oesel .... for connection with the powerful German Empire &quot;through a personal, union with the King of Prussia,&quot; and the Kaiser&apos;s reply to Riga that &quot; the request of the Land rats for incorporation with the German Umpire will be favourably considered.&quot; [The Land Councils appeal, mentions &quot; a united, self-&apos;&apos; contained, monarchical, constitutional State . . . . formed out of Livonia, Esthonia; Courland, Riga, and adjacent islands.&quot;]On April .10th Sir H. Rum bold reported, on very reliable authority, the reason why the Lithuanian Government accepted Germany&apos;s terms for recognition of Lithuanian independence. In a formal interview their delegates were informed by the German Chancellor that, if they did not accept Germany&apos;s conditions, the German
Government would immediately annex the country, and leave it no shred of inde-pendence. The terms include community of coinage, and a German control of railways, posts and telegraphs, as well as a military and economic convention.Esthonia.   (See under Lithuania and under Denmark.)Poland. On April ,.15th Sir W.
