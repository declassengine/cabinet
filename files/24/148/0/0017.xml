PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.GENERAL.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in die case of sailing ships reported, lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period April I9th-25th inclusive, was 49,416 tons gross, of which 42,412 were British, as compared with 78,982 tons gross, of which. 62,333 were British, reported last week. The Board of Trade reports : The war losses of the Allies (other than British) in March were 84,000 tons as against 55,000 in February, and of Neutrals 47,000 as against 36,000 in February. Comparing the three months October-December with January-March we find that total world losses have fallen roughly 200,000 tons, from 1,147,000 to 945,000, of which the decrease in British sinkings accounts for almost exactly half. The percentage of British to total loss has risen from 61 per cent, in February-April 1917 to 64 per cent, in January-March 1918.Franco-German Agreement regarding exchange and internment of Military and Civilian Prisoners. The Foreign Office learns that an agreement (subject to ratification by the respective Governments) was signed on April 26th by French and German delegates, regarding the exchange and internment of military and. civilian prisoners. The terms of this Agreement provide for repatriation on a very extensive scale.Dropping of Pamphlets by Airmen. The Foreign Office has received through the Swiss Authorities a proposal, by the German War Office that the dropping of leaflets by airmen should be mutually abandoned, and that when a date for such abandonment has been agreed an end should be put to the punishment of all aviators who have hitherto committed such acts. In transmitting this proposal Sir II. Rumbold observes that the distribution of such pamphlets behind the German lines is much more likely to be effective than corresponding German propaganda behind the British (and see Reports Nos. 54, 58, 59, 61 and 63).Poison Gas. German Wireless of April. 24th reports that the Prussian War Minister, von Stein, during a conference of- the Main Committee of the Reichstag, made a statement regarding the use of gas in warfare. He said : &quot; The use of gas is not a result of the present war. Gas was formerly used in fortress wars, in fighting for the defence of trenches. The now kinds of powder all developed coal oxide gases. The use of these gases was organised by the Germans and was soon copied by the enemy. Then came the time of gas attacks by means of releasing gasses, applied by the Entente, especially in the Soihnie battle, where, thanks to their excellent gas masks, the German losses were almost nil. Later on gas shells made their appearance, which caused some losses oh the German side, because it could not always be recognised whether gas shells were being used. Now an invisible gas has been invented by the Germans. The Entente has remained behind in regard to inventions in these matters. The German losses owing to gas are slight. The reports regarding the terrors of gas warfare are highly exaggerated. The effect of gasses lies in the shattering of the nerves of the enemy, who generally flees towards the rear when he is bombed with gas shells. The sick in hospitals from gas poisoning for the most part recover, and in any case lasting detriment to their health, need not be feared. For years the Entente said nothing against the use of gas, and only when the German offensive was imminent did they begin an agitation against it. Human intelligence ean devise means of protection against it, and German scientists have created masks which guarantee absolute protection. No country will consider the renunciation of the use of gas, and German scientists therefore continue to work unceasingly in order to keep Germany at the head of inventions &quot; (and sec Reports Nos. 55 and 65).
British Prisoners in Turkey. The Foreign Office learns that all British prisoners -of war were transferred from Changri to Yozgad on April 5th. The Dutch Minister at Constantinople has been requested to enquire into the condition of British officer prisoners at Kedos. His Majesty has authorised relief allowances, in essential cases, to British prisoners of war (whether European or Indian) in Turkey, ,up to  T. 18 for -officers and  T. 10 for men per month.ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM,Germany and Flanders. It is announced in the Kolnischc Volkszeitung (April 21st, e.), that the German administration in Belgium decreed on Alarch 26th that with retrospective effect to January 1st 19.1.8, all the finances of. the Flemish and Walloon districts should he administered separately. &quot; This measure,&quot; the paper says, &apos;&quot; brings the independence of Flanders a great stride nearer completion.&quot; (And see Reports Nos. 52-54, 59 and 63).CHINA.Proposed Bolshevist Consids. The Foreign Office learns that the Bolshevists are proposing to send Consids to China. The Chinese Government is at present main-taining a non-committal attitude in the matter.FRANCE.The &quot;Bonnet Rouge&quot; Case. The Times of April 29th at page 7 sets out the -essential features of the &quot;Bonnet Rouge &quot; trial (commencing on that date) in which, seven persons are charged with having relations with the enemy.Denunciation of Commercial Treaties. The French Press of April 24th attributes extreme importance to the Governments decision to denounce the commercial treaties, (see Report No. 65) and considers that this action constitutes an actual economic offensive. The 0&apos;Juvre says there is nothing unfriendly to anybody in this denunciation of the treaties. The Journal says that there are grave reasons for the Governments action, and points out that the country should henceforth have, if it desires, an absolutely free hand in its economic dealings with all nations. It was, the journal proceeds, in complete agreement with the other countries of the Entente that the French Government took its decision to treat Allied, neutral, and enemy countries on different bases. For instance, the nickel exported from French colonies will be duty free if its destination is a country belonging to the Entente, it will have to pay a small duty if its destination is a neutral nation, and a still heavier duty if the exportation is tolerated at all when the destination is Germany or one of her allies. This decision shows the Central Powers that in future France intends to throw her powerful economic weight into the scale. &quot; We solemnly warn German industry that the raw materials which the Entente possess will -no longer be at the enemy&apos;s disposal. The latter will realise France&apos;s resolute determination to prosecute an intensive war on all fronts. The measure arises from the need of shattering the narrow circle which choices all commercial initiative and from the need of overcoming once and for all, the obstacles which have hitherto hindered, the freedom of our transactions.&quot;ITALY.Italy and the Oppressed Nationalities. -In a Memorandum (G.T. 4376), dated April 25th, the Political Intelligence Department reports the proceedings of the recent  Congress of  Oppressed Nationalities,  and discusses the  motives,   aims,
difficulties  and   possible  effects   of  tbe  Tta.lo-SI.av  Entente.   (See  also  Reports. Nos. 57, 61, 63 and 64.)   &quot;The idea of  an   Italo-Slav Entente is, of course, as-old  as  Mazzini, but  the present  movement  originates with the  withdrawal  of Russia, and the  consequent isolation of Italy in the struggle against Austria.   A final incentive to action was provided by the New Year speeches of Air. Lloyd George and President Wilson, and the reports of negotiations being carried on in Switzerland  by the Western Powers in   the hope of detaching Austr.had.lnng.ary. from Germany.   Italians saw in these manifestations (1) an inadequate realisation by the   Western   Governments   of  the    impossibility&apos; of Austria-Hungary and  the insincerity of its promises of amendment; (2) quasi-abandonment of the cause of the victims of Austrian misrule and aggression in the Balkans, and of the principle of national self determination ; (3) neglect of a vital, interest of the whole Entente in establishing a solid barrier against the Germanic Drang nach Osten; (4) readiness to whittle down the aspirations and needs of Italy to the barest minimum of &apos; irredentist&apos;&apos; claims.   The alarm was therefore universal and affected all political groups.&quot;   On the question of territorial adjustments there is still a want of unanimity among the various Italian sections, but the democratic Committee &quot; for an understanding between Italy and the Jugo Slavs &quot; frankly advocates the abandonment of Italy&apos;s claim to part of the mainland of Dalmatia ; such, a policy, if adopted by the Cabinet, would seem likely to involve the elimination of the more Conservative elements of the administration.. Until the Italian Government gives clear expression of its intention, it is doubtful whether disruptive forces within Austria-Hungary will be so stirred as to effect -consequences  of military   importance.    Meanwhile, the Congress has been very successful as a demonstration (1) of the reality and  sincerity of the  movement against Austria-Hungary on the part of the subject peoples, and (2) of the possibility of harmonising their claims on a basis of liberty and justice.   (Italian press comments-are quoted in the Dally Review, Allied Press Supplement, of April 24th.) Italian Wireless-of April 26th reports :- &quot; Press comments from. Austria, state the solidarity between the J ugo-Slavs and the Czechs is continually on the increase.   The Agram paper, llrvatsks PJrzava, says : &apos; Politically and nationally Czech and Jugo-Slav interests are identical,, and even their economic interests agree.   To reach the sea the Czechs need a Jugo-Slav corridor.   The lands of the .f ugo-Slavs need Czech industries and capital,   ddie Czechs will be the teachers of the J ugo-Slavs in Sociology.&apos;   These signs of future relationships are noteworthy,   ddie Central Empires are detailing the objectives of Austria and Germany in systemizing the Balkans.   They wish to assure their own direct lines across the Balkans.    Beyond the Danube, beyond the Ceruavoda-Constanza railroad, beyond even Valona, they demand Salonika.   The newspaper Kansbanser Zeitung, says openly: &apos; ddie Central Empires cannot give Salonika to Bulgaria, because, unless   England   cedes  her  naval   bases  in   the   Mediterranean, Salonika   must become  a  free   port   and   a   German   naval,    base   for   the   German   fleet.&apos; Germany reserves to herself a similar policy in Asia at Turkey&apos;s expense, although to-day she gives assurances of respect for Ottoman suzerainty.&quot;   Italian Wireless of April  28th  reports : &quot; Austrian plans  for denationalising the Trentino   are noteworthy.     They   demonstrate   how   Austria   interprets  popular   liberty   and autonomy.    The   I nnslwucher  Naelirichten  publishes  an  article  suggesting  the denationalisation of the Italian element of the population.    It remarks that it is necessary to Germanise the land near the frontiers.   Because it is impossible to drive away all the Italians, tile Germans should at least attract Germans to the Trentino by giving them lands confiscated from. Italians.   It is suggested that, German schools should be opened, and that there should, be special privileges to encourage the use of the German language in Government offices, and also that German tourists should lie encouraged.   The Bishopric of Tronic and the clergy must also be Germanised and become a bulwark for Germany as in the middle ages.&quot;    According to a report received from Moscow, mutinies have occurred amongst Slav elements of the Austrian Army on the Italian front.Economic Policy. Italian Wireless of April 27th reports : &quot; Yesterday an important meeting was held of the chief representatives of financial institutions,, industrial firms and also commercial companies to examine the progress of national work on behalf of the Entente belligerents . . . Signer Nitti, the Minister of the Treasury, made noteworthy statements regarding the Governments future economic policy. He said, the banks must be Italian in conduct, action and methods, ddie Italian nation, as regards its banks and industries, can manage by itself, even whilst.
employing foreign capital. Italian industries must unite in order to share risks. Owing to the lack of iron and coal, Italy is making enormous industrial efforts, and such efforts will have to be maintained after the war. It is necessary that some enterprise should unite all the credit institutions, and constitute a large bank for exports, formed with the help of all the hanks, and also an Italian bank for utilising hydraulic power. It is necessary to make a study for the creation of a special Institute of Public Works.&quot;Food Supply. The Foreign Office informs Sir R. Rodd that Plis Majesty&apos;s Govefn-ment has arranged for the diversion of an extra supply of wheat to Italian requirements (sec Report No. 65).JAPAN.Resignation of Foreign Minister. Sir C. Greene reports the resignation of Viscount Motono, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Pie is succeeded by Baron Goto, Minister of the Interior, who has already issued a declaration of continued solidarity with the Allies. m.Ri.ee. Sir 0. Greene reports that the Japanese Government intends shortly to take over and distribute all imported rice, thus, ia effect, abolishing tlie import duties. Meanwhile the Department of Agriculture and Commerce has recommended that export licences should state definitely whether the relative consignment is for transhipment or consumption in Japan.. PORTUGAL.Presidential Flection. Sir L. Carnegie reports the election of Senhor Paes as President of the Republic. There was no other candidate, and the number of votes was small.Customs Duties. Sir P. Carnegie reports the publication of a decree fixing, a&apos;s from May 1st, the proportion of Customs duties payable in gold in accordance with the variation from time to time of the exchange on London.UNITED STATES.Reorganisation of Aircraft Arrangements. Lord Reading reports the appointment of Mr. John D. Ryan as Director of Aircraft Production for the United States Army, with Executive Control. The Aircraft Board will remain as an advisory body, Mr. Ryan replacing Air. Coffin as Chairman. A division of Military Aeronautics under Brigadier-General William L. Henly is instituted in place of the existing Air Section of the Signal Corps under General Squier.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA HUNGARY.Austria and Germany. The Foreign Office learns that the Kaiser has sent an autograph letter to Count Czernin, thanking him for his policy and conferring upon him the Iron Cross of the First Class. Tisza has declared in the Hungarian Chamber that Baron Burian will firmly maintain the alliance with Germany and avail himself of the first opportunity to reach an honourable peace. This alliance would, he added, be kept more closely after the war. Tisza having spoken only of Burian, Wekerle said that he must complete Tisza&apos;s speech by adding that King Karl had always been a most loyal supporter of the alliance. He declared that he had seen the letter to Prince Sixte of Bourbon, and that it contained nothing but attempts at peace made in conjunction with Germany, that there was nothing in the letter directed against Germany, and that the text published by Czernin was the genuine one. He added that the new minister would follow the same policy as his predecessor. Bolshevist opinion on Austro-German relations is thus expressed in the Official Journal of April 16th: &quot;A cleft is made visible in the Central Alliance by the Czernin-5681-1 b B
Clemenceau controversy. Austria is indifferent about Alsace Lorraine, where the Germans get iron ore and potash. Austria is merely a bridge for Germany to the East. Austria is eager to terminate the war. She is hungry for Ukrainian bread, which can only be easily got by an exchange of manufactured goods, and the latter cannot be had even from neutral countries. Austria needs capital which Germany cannot supply, and is therefore looking to America for it; hence Ozernihs politeness to Wilson. It is premature to expect a rupture between Germany and Austria, as the latter is too dependent. The Austrian Government fears a revolution and this fear-ties it to Germany.&quot; The Foreign Office learns that, though Baron Buriau has the support of the Tisza party in Hungary, he has no reliable following in Austria, and is therefore considered unlikely to retain office for long.   (See also under &quot; Germany.&quot;)Central Powers and the Jews) The Vienna Morgenzeitung publishes a report of a pogrom against the Jews at-Cracow on April 10th. No protection was given by the police, and a great meeting of protest was therefore held by the Jews, who resolved to .organise measures of self-defence. The affair was falsely represented by the authorities as an ordinary hunger, riot. According to the Arbeiter Zeitung of April 19th the Jews are being brutally ill-treated, at Jedinci in Bessarabia. These reports would appear to conflict with the claim of the Central Powers to have secured good treatment for Jews in Eastern Europe. (See also Reports Nos. 58, 60 and 04, under &quot; Germany.&quot;)Ukrainians and the Administration of Galicia. Press telegrams of April 25th state that the Austrian. Premier, Dr. von Seidler, has promised to the Polish members of the Austrian Parliament that the administration of Galicia should be handed back to the Poles. The Political Intelligence Department observes :--&quot;This may please the Polish gentry and intelligentsia in Galicia, but will have no influence on the revolutionary movement among the Polish peasants and workmen, and will drive the Ukrainians into sheer frenzy. The Ukrainians, who form about 80 per cent, of the population of East Galicia, would prefer any, even a military government, to that of the Polish landowners. Until now they entertained hopes for a division of Galicia into an Ukrainian and a Polish part. Should, dominion over the entire country be once more conceded to the Poles, nothing will be left to the Ukrainians but revolution. Whilst the Polish masses in Galicia hardly share the Jingo interest of the Polish gentry and intelligentsia in East Galicia, to every Ukrainian, peasant the problem of East Galicia is of vital importance.&quot;Food conditions in Austria. Addressing a public meeting recently in Vienna, the Burgomaster, Herr Weisskirchner, said (according to a Press report) : &quot; The available food supplies are very scanty, and it will require the greatest sacrifices ou the part of the population to hold out during the coming weeks. The organisation of the official provisioning bureaus has broken down, and in addition to this the greatest confusion, prevails as a result of the issue of most contradictory and. impossible food orders and regulations. In consequence of: these ordinances the shopkeepers never know from one day to another whether or not they will be sent to prison.&quot; The Burgomaster also declared that he foresaw the day wdren the middle class trader would be reduced to a state of beggary if the present conditions were allowed to continue for any length of time. In conclusion, Herr Weisskirchner expressed his regret at the disappointment of the hopes which had been raised by the mis-statements iii regard to expected imports of foodstuffs from the Ukraine, adding : &quot; Austria&apos;s only hope now lies in obtaining further aid from Germany.&quot;Conditions in Bohemia.  The Political Intelligence Department quotes the Keue Freie Presse of March 26th as showing the misery, disease and mortality in Bohemia due to insufficient and improper feeding.Miners&apos; Strike. According to a Press telegram of April 24th &quot; the Austrian Minister of Railways has announced the complete suspension of passenger traffic on the Northern Railway in consequence of the shortage of coal, due to the miners&apos; strike.&quot;Probable Socialist Strikes. Sir IL Rumbold reported on April 00th that one-day Socialist strikes were expected to take place throughout Austria and Bohemia on May 1st.Changes in the Hungarian Ministry. The Foreign Office learns that general strikes, of limited duration, have taken place in Budapest as a demonstration in favour of universal suffrage.   According to a Budapest telegram (quoted by the Daily Review
of April 26th) Dr. Wekerle has announced the resignation of the Hungarian Govern-J ment on the ground that it had become doubtful whether it would be authorised to dissolve Parliament in order to carry through suffrage reform. Press telegrams refer to an attempt by Joseph Szterenyi (Minister of Commerce in the Wekerle Cabinet) to form&apos; an administration, and emphasise his pro-German leanings. The Political Department points out that this is probably a confusion of names and that the appoint-ment, is more likely to have been given to Count Beta Serenyi, a Magyar aristocrat. According to a Budapest telegram of April 25th, however, Count Sereuyhs attempt to form a Cabinet, which appeared to have practically succeeded, has failed. According to the evening papers, Count Szterenyi could not meet the. demand of the Socialist parties under Count Kafolyi for an absolute guarantee that the House would he dissolved, and new elections ordered if the Electoral Reform Bill could, not be passed through the Lower House in the course of the autumn without amendment. A Budapest telegram appearing in the Lokal-Anzeiger (April 28th) affirms that Dr. Wekerle has been entrusted by the King with, tire formation of a new Cabinet. Dr. Wekerle accepted the task and immediately initiated, negotiations. He had a, two hours&apos; conference with Count Tisza. ft is also stated that Dr. Wekerle is planning the formation of a coalition Cabinet on the basis of a compromise in regard to the Suffrage Bill.Socialist celebrations in Hungary. The Nepszava (April 10th) publishes a manifesto of tlie Hungarian Socialist Party proclaiming a general strike for May 1st, and a public meeting to demand political rights, social reforms, and first of ail. peace, so much desired by all peoples. &quot; On May 5th Marx festivals will be held all over the country to celebrate the .1.00th birthday of the founder of the science of class war, of the man who declared that the working-classes can only be freed by their own strength.&quot;See also under &quot;Spain. &quot; and. &quot;Sweden.&quot;GERMANY.German Opinions on the War. lire views of a moderate German of some distinction are thus reported to the Foreign Office : There are at present three different attitudes in Germany towards the pvar. First, unshaken confidence and. belief that England can be conquered; this feeling is shared by the Military Party, the Conservatives, and the metallurgical industrialists. Secondly, war-weariness and susceptibility to the idea of a reasonable peace ; this is felt by the generality of the people, i.e., the peasants, soldiery and lower middle classes. Thirdly&quot;; fear of the economic ruin of the country, inevitable u nless a commercial boycott can be prevented by diplomatic bargaining with German territorial acquisition ; this is the conviction of the financiers, shipping magnates, and leaders of industry. It is stated that Baron Kuhlmann favours an early peace, and is disposed to negotiate with. England, but that there js a considerable section of opinion which, having abandoned hope of defeating or exhausting the British, aims at influencing them through the conversion of the United States. The importance of the economic blockade is also emphasised in statements made by other prominent Germans. Meanwhile, stress is laid upon the serious conditions of German mines and railways. According to a report received by the Foreign Office the Germans also seem to have come to an end of some of their raw materials. The opinion is expressed that if they can get a decision, in their favour within the next two months, they would have no difficulty in inducing the people to hold out quietly until the next harvest ; but if the decision goes against them, their failure will, coincide with the period at which their stocks are lowest, and the effect upon the masses may be decisive. The Foreign Office learns of a recent influx into Switzerland of prominent Germans, all hinting at Germany&apos;s readiness to discuss &quot; a reasonable peace&quot;; it is suggested that they are either anticipating a. failure in the West or attempting to Aveaken Allied preparations for a long struggle.Submarine Campaign. Sir R. Paget reports that the belief seems to be current in Coi)enhagen that the Germans intend after the first Aveek of May to sink every possible vessel, including those AAdrich up till now they have spared. As the result of this, there has been a considerable fall in shipping shares.Germany and Russia. Mr. Lockhart transmits the following literal summary of a leading article in Pravda, the official organ of the Bolshevist Bress, on Count MirbaclPs -arrival: &quot;The Embassy of the German Government has arrived at Moscoav. It.has been pleased to come to the capital of Soviet Russia on the strength of diplomatic
ex-territoriality ; at the same time the German Generals, who receive their orders, irom the same staff of German Imperialists from which Mirbach springs, are entering Russian towns behind smoking guns in the.name of complete right to everything that they &quot;can snatch from the Soviet Republic. The German. Ambassador has arrived in the revolutionary capital not,as the representative of class of a friendly nation but as plenipotentiary of a military gang who with boundless insolence are killing, violating and robbing everywhere they can penetrate with their bloody Imperialistic bayonet, ddie Ambassador of victorious Imperialism arrives in the capital of the militarily weakest Socialist country, and he would be a fool who takes the switch for the olive branch of peace, ddie representatives of German Imperialism have arrived in Moscow,, but they have been forced to allow in. Berlin the lied Embassy of the Russian revolutionary Republic. Even if our comrades arrive in Berlin as representatives of a defeated &quot;country in a military sense they are nevertheless representatives of a country morally victorious. Not one German workman will meet the Ambassador of Socialistic Russia with such hate as that with which to-day in Moscow the Russian proletariat meets the representative of German Capital.&quot; ddie newspaper Zaryarosii, after declaring that Bolshevism cannot last, observes that matters are reaching a stage-at which crystallisation becomes possible. Since the Allies make no sign from Vologda, Germany is left a freehand. After the Lwow, Kerensky and Lenin periods, Russia, now enters on the Mirbach period. Scythian isolation is succeeded by European ism enforced by bayonets. German-Russian relations cannot henceforth be described as diplomatic. Till a national feeling arises, Russia is doomed, to be a mere pariah object of politics.German and Austrian Prisoners in Russia,. Sir C. Greene learns that converts to Bolshevism amongst German and Austrian prisoners of war are daily increasing and already number about 20,000. According to the Bolshevist Official Journal, the German Government lias made a peremptory demand for the disarmament, of prisoners of war and the suppression of their revolutionary committees. It is complained that prisoners of war at Omsk prevent other war prisoners returning to Germany, ddie separation of Germans from Austrians is also demanded. (And set; Reports Nos. G2 and 64.)Germany and Poland. Mr. Wardrop learns that the Germans are endeavouring to Germanise the first Polish Corps. It is proposed that General Beseler should he-placed, in command and that an oath should be taken of obedience to the German and Austrian Emperors. Polish opinion, both National and Socialist, is entirely opposed to this.    (And see Report No. 04.)Germany and the Ukraine. According to the military bulletin of the Bolshevist Official Journal, the Germans are forming an Ukrainian army for use on the French front, and calling up all. those who were 18 last new &apos;year. The Official Journal states that there is hunger typhus at Kiev, while heavy trainloads of-food are leaving for Germany.Dissensions among Central Allies. Rheinisehe Westfdlisehe Zeitung of April 1.7th,. quoted by the Daily-Review, writes : &quot;Idelfferich is being sent to straighten out the-clifficulties between Bulgaria and dhirkey, but will find no easy task. The Central. Powers wdsh to give the Dobrudja to Bulgaria on condition that the line of communi-cation between Tchernovoda and Constanza remains open for the economic needs of the Central Powers. Bulgaria demands compensation for this, and opposes the frontier rectification demanded, by Turkey. Bulgaria would like to have Salonica, but this wish cannot be granted, because Salonica is to be made a naval base of the Central Powers, and a free port in the event of England refusing to surrender her Mediterranean possessions Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar, and Egypt. (See also tinder &apos;&apos; A ustria-Hungary.&apos;&apos;)Reichstag Criticism of the Military Authorities.- The Daily Review reports:   &quot;According to the Voncdrts&apos; version of the proceedings at the meeting of the Main Committee of the Reichstag on April 25th, the military authorities were severely censured for their policy in the East and in the West. The question put by Ledebour whether it was true that a great number of German soldiers were drowned in the Flanders floods was simply denied by shouts. Scheidemann, criticising the Press censorship, mentioned as a typical case the suppression of a resolution passed by the Alsace-Lorraine Diet. Midler (Meiningen), Progressive, sarcastically remarked that the reports about the Zeebrugge raid did not correspond with the facts, while Gothein.
(Progressive) said that the military authorities&apos; attitude towards the Eastern Border . States was felt as a disgrace by everyone. Noske (Soc. Map) disclosed the fact that public institutions in the Ukraine were openly insulted, by the military command, which, in its instructions to soldiers, ordered them to regard the abolition of demo-cratie institutions as their main task, the result being that the soldiers themselves revolted against the execution of such commands. Speaking on this topic, Ledebour even went so far as to say the German action, in the Ukraine was a violation oO treaties which was driving the Ukrainian farmers into open revolt, lie asked, for information as to why the German military authorities invaded the Crimea, and. finally expressed his fear that conditions in. Finland would soon resemble those in the Ukraine. All these accusations were ignored by the Government benches.&quot;The Pichnowshy Memorandum. According to a Berlin telegram, the Prussian Upper House has decided to grant the request of tlie First State Attorney of District Court (Landesgeiicht)&apos;No. 1 of Berlin for authorisation to undertake criminal proceedings against Prince Lichnowsky. Professor Boning, speaking in Committee as -reporter on the question of authorisation, said that Prince Liclmowsky gave a number of his acquaintances access to his memorandum. The State Attorney regarded this as an. offence against paragraph 353 of the Penal Code, because the Prince illegally -communicated to third persons documents officially entrusted to him or instructions given him by superiors, or their contents, thereby infringing the official secrecy incumbent upon him. A petition by Prince Lichnowsky&apos;s solicitor asked the House to grant the request of the State Attorney, as Prince Lichnowsky had great interest in facts, which were often distorted, being partially cleared up. The Commission unanimously recommended that consent should be given.   (And see Report No. 6.1.)Control of Eastern Trade. A. Christian.;a message of 27th April quoted, by the Daily Review states :- &quot; It is learnt from an. excellent source that a number of great German and Austro-1 Bulgarian concerns, including the German Oriental Co., the North German Lloyd, and LohmaiPs, have formed a huge combine under the name of the Enropaisehe Handel sgesellschaf I, at Bremen. The proposed objects are : (1) To control and centralise the import trade of war products, animals, vegetables, textiles, minerals, and all kinds of raw materials from Russia, Persia, Manchuria, China, Turkestan, Rumania, and Finland ; (2) to organise a Union, of all Exporters in the countries mentioned, who had business relations with Germany before the war ; (3) to cut off the neutrals who deal with the Allies from the products of the above-mentioned countries and from all commerce with the Central Powers ; (4) to organise a boycott and undermine the financial and commercial position of the pro-Entente neutrals ;&apos; (5) to form a Central Power commercial block, including friendly neutrals. Officially, the. company will be liquidated at the end of one year after peace is signed, but it will con tinue un official ally,&quot;Alsace-Lorraine [Protest in the Diet). A significant circumstance attending the reopening of the Alsace-Lorraine Diet is pointed out by the S trass burg correspondent of the Stattgarter Beobaehter (quoted by the Daily Review) : &quot; The President of the Second Chamber, Dr. Rickliu, only received 23 votes, although 47 out of 60 deputies were present. The statement of the Under Secretary, Herr Folder, on the Budget was received in silence, and the Budget was referred to the Commission without a. word being spoken.&quot; The correspondent asks what is the reason of these highly &apos; remarkable proceedings, and continues: Just before the Convocation of the Diet the Statthalter had announced that nothing must be said in the Diet regarding the most important question of the couiitry&apos;s future, namely, its independence or its inclusion in some federal State. The attitude of the deputies at the election of presidents, as also at the introduction of the Budget, was a protest against this order. The election was made under protest, and silence was maintained owing to the deputies being unable to speak their minds, as they wished, and should be able to do.&quot; The Vorwarts&apos; comment on these incidents is that it is probable they will be discussed in the Reichstag.Pood Supply : The Neu-Kolln Scandals. The Daily Review reports : &quot; The action brought by the Public Prosecutor in Berlin against the Council of Neu-Kolin, a suburb of the capital, in connection with the boroughs purchases of foodstuffs last year, through secret channels, at prices exceeding the maximum fixed hy the Govern-in ent, has revealed further facts as to the true state of food conditions in the big cities of Germany.   The prosecutor ordered the seizure of the books of the city pay50S1-n c
office, which led to angry scenes, as the latter suspended payment of relief. Hundreds of soldiers&apos; dependants rushed to the office, and their attitude became so threatening that the Public Prosecutor was obliged to return the books by Saturday. The Berlin Tageblatt (April 21st) says that the borough council last year was forced to make secret purchases, as the clamour for food became &quot;more and more urgent. Women penetrated into the Town Hall and threw themselves on the ground begging for bread and other foodstuffs, while others forced their way into the private rooms of the Upper Burgomaster and even assaulted him. Great demonstrations took place, leading to turbulent scenes before the Town Hall. The Council was obliged to act, as the War Pood Board remained, deaf to all entreaties, and it made its purchases through secret channels, simultaneously publishing the famous memorial which, revealed &quot;the true facts of the situation, and led to the action against the Council.Preparations for . Demobilisation. The Berliner Tageblatt (Apr. .15, ii.) reports from a reliable source : &quot;The main preparations for the transfer of men in the army to economic life when the time comes have been completed. They are they result of close co-operation, between the military authorities, the civil authorities of the Empire and. the States, and of the authoritative organisation of our economic life. &apos; The very important task of finding employment for men has been carefully worked out iu all its details with experts on employment, the public employment organisations, the Labour Exchanges, the workers, and the employers. Further details will be announced later. There is no reason, to fear that one will be too late. On the contrary, everyone may rest assured that the military authorities have made as careful preparations for transferring soldiers back, to economic life as they did for mobilising them.&quot;&apos;Germany and the Jews. According to the Norddeulsch kllgemeine Zeitung (ApriP25th), a society has been formed in Berlin for the promotion of Zionism &quot; within the limits of Germany&apos;s policy in the Orient.&quot; The directors include Professor Hans Delbriick.- Germany and the Baltic.-An account of German, historical interests in the Baltic is to be found in The New Europe of April 18th.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.Railway Strikes.-Sir R. Tower reports an improvement in the outlook with regard to the railway strikes (see Report No. 65).Transfer to Argentina of Enemy Ships in Chile. Tire War Trade Intelligence Department reports : &quot; The United States Government have sanctioned the transfer to the Argentine flag of three enemy ships in Chile on the understanding they will be used to transport nitrates to the United. States and will carry no crews, officers, or passengers of enemy nationality. His MajeEty&apos;s CTOvernment have concurred in this arrangement.CHILE.Internment of &quot; Dresden&quot; Prisoners. The Foreign. Office instructs Sir F. Stronge to make encpiiiies of the Chilian Government as to the control exercised over interned prisoners from the German -warship Dresden.DENMARK.Danish-American Negotiations.  Sir R. Paget reports that the German Govern-ment is insisting that in any agreement made by Denmark 400,000 tons of shipping must be reserved for Danish use. Safe-conducts would be given to Danish ships trading in purely Danish interests outside the war zone, but no guarantee is yet
promised regarding coal ships. All other Danish shipping engaged upon Allied interests will be sunk without compunction. Lord Leading reports that the Danish Government is again hesitating to conclude a general agreement and expressing a-desire to negotiate on. a footing of cargo for cargo (and - see Reports Nos. 67-59 and 65).FINLAND.Recognition. The Foreign Office authorises Sir E. Howard to publish in Scandinavia and Finland the terms of the British proposals for conditional recognised -riitioh of the Finnish Government (see Reports Nos. 64- and 65). Sir E. Howard learns that the offer is regarded &quot;with much satisfaction hy the Finnish Representative at Stockholm, who is now reported to anticipate the early release of those British subjects who have been arrested in Finnish territory hy the Germans (see Reports Nos. 60 and 62). Lord Reading reports that the United States Government does not at present propose to take any action towards recognition of the independence of Finland.Finland and Germany. Sir E. Howard reports the statement of a person in touch with Finnish Government, circles, according to which it would appear that President Swinhufvud and Mr. Renvall are both anxious that Finland should adopt a neutral and. independent policy, and that the Senate does not wish to return to Helsingfors until the Germans have left. In that event it is probable that M. Sario would be replaced by another Foreign Minister. It is added that the Finnish Government believes that independence can best be secured through the assistance of the Western Powers and by the acquisition of an. outlet to the Arctic Ocean, for which latter purpose the internatioualisation of the Murman Railway is suggested.Germany and Russian Rights in Finland. According to a Russian Wireless report, the Bolshevist Government has instructed its representative at Berlin to protest against. (1) the refusal of the German command at Helsingfors to permit the local Russian command to communicate in cipher by wireless ; (2) the refusal of the German and Finnish Governments to entrust to Russian ships the destruction of mines in Finnish waters.General Export Prohibition. The General Swedish Export Association states in the Swedish Press that it has been officially informed that the Finnish Senate has issued an export prohibition on all goods. It is not yet decided whether goods for which an export licence was obtained prior to the revolution may be exported from Finland.Scandinavian Socialists and the Finnish Government. Sir E. Howard reports that on April 28th a representative deputation of Swedish Socialists handed to the. Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires in. Stockholm a protest by Socialists of Norway, Sweden and Denmark against the drastic reprisals of the Whites against, the Reds. The Charge (PAffaires declared his inability to forward the document, as this would amount to unjustifiable intervention. The deputation referred to Finland&apos;s requests for military intervention, and protested that their action could scarcely be called improper at a time when peace by conciliation was universally desired. On the same day the Swedish Socialists held a meeting of protest against the &quot; White Terror.&quot; They, have also expressed disapproval of the action of Burgomaster Lindhagen in -approaching the German Legation in the matter.MEXICO.Aggressive Attitude of Carranza Government. Lord Reading reports that anarchy prevails upon the West Coast of Mexico, and that the Mexican Authorities are making difficulties on the border. Two American citizens have been kidnapped in Tepic. Air. Cummins learns that Carranza is taking steps towards the enlistment of males under 45, and there is reason to believe that the Government is preparing to attack Hie United States, thus effecting, under German inspiration, a diversion of American military effort. Many Germans haAre recently entered Mexico from Guatemala and the United States, and it is reported that others may arrive from Cuba.   It is
estimated that upwards of 5,000 trained Germans might be available for carranza&apos;s army. The proprietor of an influential pro-ally newspaper has been ordered to leave the country, and his paper has been taken over by the Government. The Government has also addressed an offensive communication to the Italian Minister-Lord Reading learns that a revolution of elements sympathetic with the Allies is in preparation, but that Carranza and the Germans are likely to attack the oilfields in anticipation. &quot;Meanwhile Caballero (see Report No. 65), with upwards of 2,00&apos;) adherents, is believed to he aiming at Tampico, which, is, however, occupied by Government troops:Proposed Taxation on Petroleurn.--&apos;Mr. Cummins reports that the Eagle Oil Company is lodging a strong protest against the proposed new taxation on the* export of Mexican oil (see Report No. 58).NETHERLANDS.. Germany and the Netherlands. With reference to the German demands upon the Netherlands Government set out in Report No. 65, Sir W. Townley reports that a request has now been put forward for free passage down the Scheldt of German and Austrian vessels at Antwerp. This the Netherlands Government is determined to resist. It has, however, offered to allow transit to Belgium of 1,600,000 tons of sand and gravel for the current year. Sir W. Tbwnley has pointed out that from this amount must be deducted 370,000 tons transited last autumn on account of 10J8 requirements : and that inspection must be allowed or guarantees given by the Germans, ddie Netherlands Government is also trying to arrange for a reduction of the amounts which the Germans demand shall be exported from Holland. In exchange for these materials the Netherlands Government is asking for steel and coal. The German claim for passage of civilian goods over the Roermond Railway is conceded on condition that Dutch control is established to prevent the transmission, of provisions or military material to the German forces. In reply to an article by Georg; Bernhard in the Vossische Zeitung, Handelsblad of April. 30th declares that the Allied requisition is not comparable with the present German demands, which threaten the honour and safety of Holland and must be forcibly resisted. , ddie Foreign Office learns that the German High Command lias been putting pressure upon Baron Kuhlmann. in connection with these demands, and that the danger to Holland will continue so long as the military party is in the ascendant.Allies and Dutch. Tonnage. Sir W. Townley reports that the Netherlands Foreign Minister, speaking on April 25th in the hirst Chamber, declared that the Government would agree to an exchange of ships as soon as absolute certainty existed that the matter was in order on the other side of the ocean, ddie United. States Minister thought, an undertaking had. already been given in writing that ships would not be detained in America after March 20th. Tlie Netherlands Government expected such an under-taking shortly. Before it was received no ship -would leave, ddie intention, was to continue exchange of ships, and perhaps six ships would thus sail continually. The Minister hoped more would sail later. He was convinced Germany would not place obstruction in the way, but he was asking for an undertaking and thought he could, rely on receiving it. ddie general arrangement on the London basis had indeed lapsed, ddie Minister had reasons for expecting that the Associated Governments would observe the obligations regarding the rationing of Holland.German Propaganda and the Allied, Requisition. German Wireless of April 26th quotes [let Vaterland of April 24th as contrasting the Allied treatment of Dutch and Norwegian shipping. &quot; Dutch ships are to be compelled to bring troops, arms and munitions across to Europe, while Norwegian ships can voyage to South America, which was one of the first conditions desired for Dutch ships. &quot;What does the preference for Norway mean ? &quot;NORWAY.Norwegian-American Negotiations. Sir M. Findlay reports that the Norwegian Government has been endeavouring to obtain in the proposed Norwegian-American Agreement (see Reports Nos. 59, 60 and 65) a substitution of Government control
of imports for control fry the recognised Associations. Sir M. Findlay has pointed out to the Norwegian Foreign Minister the objections to this proposal.Norwegian Fish.- The Foreign Office informs Sir M. Findlay that fish may be exported from the north of Norway to Russia (see Report No. 55) on condition (inter alia) that shipment is not made to Finland or any territory in de facto occupation of the enemy.   Salt should not be shipped, in bulk.Export Prohibition. Sir M. Findlay reports the prohibition for export of bamboo cane and goods manufactured therewith.SPAIN.The Neiv Ministry and the Allies. The Political Intelligence Department points out that the new Spanish Administration has already demonstrated its goodwill towards the Allies by upholding the recently concluded commercial treaties (see Reports Nos. 59 and 65) in spite of German protests, taking precautions against the escape of the latest refugee submarine (see Report No. 65), withdrawing the proposed export duty on potatoes, aud promising - to transfer to Spain German officers in Fernando Po.Food Supply The Political Intelligence Department notes the growing scarcity of bread, meat and other kinds of food in Spain ; this has led to Senor Yentosa, the new Commissioner of Supply, being called into consultation by the Cabinet, and. to hints at the introduction of a system of rationing.Enemy Financial Activity. The Foreign Office learns of the impending formation in Spain of a Spanish Austro-Hungarian Bank for the facilitation of enemy transactions.German Correspondence from Spain to Central and South, America. The Foreign Office learns^that a considerable correspondence relating to commercial and financial transactions is still carried on by Germans aud their cloaks in Spain with persons in Mexico, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela.German Intrigues in Morocco. The Political Intelligence Department points out that the question of Morocco, though not likely to lead, to any definite action from any quarter at the moment, is one that arouses a good deal of feeling both in Spain and elsewhere. It is the most important question in Spanish Foreign politics and has been the centre of most of Spain&apos;s diplomatic activities for a good many years. By a succession of treaties and arrangements following upon the gradual collapse of the authority of the Sultan of Morocco, that country has now been divided into a French zone, much the largest, a Spanish zone, which consists of not much more than a long strip of coast opposite Spain, and a small international territory consisting of the town of Tangier and its immediate neighbourhood. This arrangement is clue to the Franco-tier man Convention of 1911 and the subsequent treaty of .1912 between France and Spain. By the first of these Germany acknow-ledged the protectorate of France over the whole of Morocco; by the second a Spanish zone was created, in which Spain has the same powers as France in the rest of Morocco. The international district of: Tangier remained as created by the Algeciras Conference, but the statute for its government had not been approved, by Spain when the war broke out, and the matter has since stood over. This situation obviously offered material which has not been neglected for German intrigue (see Reports Nos. 63 and 64, and the Times of April 30th and May 1st), which has been effectively criticised in Count Romanone&apos;s paper the Diario. Spanish interest in Morocco is divided : the governing classes cling to a footing there as a matter of national dignity ; the masses are indifferent.SWEDEN.Food Supply. The Foreign Office learns that the German Government has declared its inability to provide any wheat for Sweden before May 1919. In view, however, of the purchase of 50,000 tons from Denmark, it would now appear that theof iS 1  16 D
present Swedish bread ration will be maintained until the beginning of September, and it is expected that the new harvest will be available by the middle of that month.Imports from Austria and Russia. The Swedish Press reports an,Agreement (subject to sanction by the respective Governments) between a Swedish Import Consortium and an Austrian Export Consortium, for the delivery between May and October of 1,660 tons of oil (probably lubricating) and 1,200 tons of petroleum to the Swedish Consortium, who would then sell to the Industrial Commission. Deliveries under a similar agreement, concluded last December&apos;, are still proceeding. The Industrial Commission also expects to import from Russia on. very favourable terms, aluminium, electrolytic copper, tin in ingots, brass in bars and several thousand tons of brass shavings.Control of Metals. Sir E. Howard reports that the Industrial Commission has by Royal Decree been given control, as from April 15th, of all trade in and manufacture of copper, tin, aluminium, antimony, bismuth, platinum, mercury, and their alloys, ferro-tungsten, ferro-chrome, ferro-nickel, ferro-vanadium, unalloyed tungsten and nickel, tinned iron plate, zinc and lead ; also powers to requisition metals.Control of Cotton and Linen Goods. Sir E. Howard reports the issue of l-Ryal Decrees restricting the sale and export of various woollen, cotton and linen goods, and fixing maximum prices for cotton-yarn and tissues.Turkish Propaganda. Sir E. Howard learns that a party of Turkish Socialists is proceeding to Stockholm for the purpose of making propaganda out of alleged, massacres of Turks by Armenians. Meanwhile delegates of the Greek Socialist party in London have requested the Socialists in Stockholm that a Committee of neutral Socialists may be formed to enquire into the treatment by the Turks of the Greek population of Asia Minor.Transit goods in Norway. Sir E. Howard, requests that in order to obviate improper sales in Sweden, steps may be taken at Christiania to prevent the forwarding&apos; from Norway of transit goods (including goods diverted from Archangel.)Socialist Demands. The Swedish Press of April 23rd (quoted by the Daily-Review) reports that the following demands were outlined in tire resolution adopted at a meeting at Stockholm, which was attended by 12,000 Socialists : (.1) A maximum working day of eight hours. (2) Effective support for people out of work. (3) Reduction of the present maximum prices. (4) Reasonable maximum prices for all goods.(5) Rationing of all kinds of foodstuffs, preceded by expropriation of all food supplies, including supplies stored by the wealthy for their own con-sumption.(6) Military provisions to lie seized and. used, for public rationing. (7).Military training be reduced to a minimum.(8) All working power available to be given the opportunity of participating inthe production of foodstuffs and to be organised in a rational, way. (9) Interests derived from the Avar profiteering to  be given, as loans without interest to poor people desiring to participate in the jirocluction of food. ^ - (10) General rationing of accommodations.(11) The requisitioning of all tonnage fit for facilitating the import of goods.The resolution ended : &quot; We are confident that the Government will realise that these demands of the working and starving people are worthy of receiving prompt and absolute approval.&quot;SWITZERLAND.Swiss Negotiations with Allies. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the Swiss-Government will provide the Allies with 180,000 tons of wood during the six months May-October inclusive in addition to about 50,000 tons for delivery under outstanding
private contracts. With, regard to agricultural &quot;produce, the Allies are likely to secure 80 per cent, of Swiss milk products available for exportation. Apart from this agreement, it is understood that a limitation will be placed upon the export oC cattle and preserved meat.   &apos; -/&apos;Sudss-German Negolialiont. Sir If. Hum bold reports that the Germans are insisting that German, coal shall, not be used by Swiss industries for the manufacture of articles exported, to the Allies, or alternatively that Germany shall control the. distribution of coal in Switzerland. It would appear that the Swiss Government may be driven to adopt the former condition. Sir II. Rumbold has pointed out that in such a case it may be necessary to refuse the provision of imported foodstuffs to German, subjects or employees of firms engaged upon German contracts, and also to rescind the right of German firms entered in the 1*914 Register of Commerce to receive goods through the S.S.S. Sir H. Rumbold observes that an offer to double the present Allied supply of coal might have valuable effects in countering German influence.Germany and Grain Boats. An official communication has been issued in Berne (April 25th) announcing that the negotiations between the Swiss and German Governments regarding the question of permits for ships conveying grain for Switzerland have been concluded. An agreement has been signed in Berlin by which all ships laden with grain, other foodsttdfs, and forage consigned to Switzerland will have a safe conduct so long as they proceed to Cette or a neutral port, and avoid the &quot; blockaded &quot; zone. Both neutral ships and the ships of the nations at. war with Germany may be used in this service. To make the latter class of ships in particular easily recognisable, it has been decided that each vessel shall bear on both sides of her hull the word &quot; Suisse &quot; or &quot; Schweiz,&quot; in white letters on a black ground, and also the Swiss Arms as large as possible, and that these signs shall be illuminated at night. In addition, each vessel will carry the Swiss flagon her mizzeu mast. Each vessel so-granted safe conduct must be provided with, a declaration that the vessel, is not carrying any other merchandise than that described in her official papers. Besides the Swiss flag, the vessels will fly the flag of their own country. The German naval forces will be immediately advised of this arrangement, but it will 1)6 impossible to be certain before a lapse of three months that all submarines will have received these instructions. The majority, however, can be advised by wireless, so that the danger for Swiss grain ships will be relatively small.German Intrigue. Sir R. Rodd reports a statement that German, agents are being employed to denounce to the Allies various banks and industrial concerns in Switzerland ; it is hoped that these may thus become black-listed, and consequently hostile to the Allies, and dependent on German, custom and assistance.Sir 1:1. Rumbold reports that several Italian Zimmervaldists have been arrested at Zurich, consequent upon a discovery of bombs, infernal machines and a tube of bacilli. There is reason to believe that these men were in enemy pay. On a previous occasion Italian Revolutionaries similarly implicated took refuge in Germany.VENEZUELA.Neutrality. Mr. Beaumont reports that a Presidential message of April 27th to the Venezuelan Congress re-affirms emphatically the strict neutrality of the Republic.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. The general discussions have been of less importance than usual this week, excepting the indications of an apparent German intention to twist the terms of the peace treaty in order to get hold of the Russian war vessels.There are more signs of German preparations, especially in Switzerland, for launching a peace offensive in the near future ; so far reports about the terms likely to be put forward are contradictory. It is said on good authority that they may include an offer to restore the freedom of Belgium in exchange for the return of some German Colonies.sosi-i&apos;.e
Russia. :Oxi April 21st (received 27th) Mr. Wardrop reported an order issued by Trotsky drawing attention to Article 2 of: the Brest Treaty, which prohibits agitation and propaganda directed against the German Government, and also enlistment of foreigners in the Red Army.On April 19th (received. April 26th) Mr. Wardrop reported on the authority of the Official Journal in Moscow, that von Kuhlmann had telegraphed to M. Ghicherin that, after- April 20th, any warships formerly belonging to the Black Sea Fleet winch violated Article 5 of the Brest Treaty would be treated as outlawed and. hostile&apos;. M. Obicheriu had. replied that some small, vessels at Batum were counter revolutionaries, and. that the Russian opinion was that, under Article 5, war ships had the right to claim (sic) Russian harbours and to navigate, so the Russian Government hoped that Germany would refrain from hostile action. The Black Sea Fleet would be ordered strictly to carry out the provisions of the Brest Treaty.On April 25th German Wireless replied, through Count Mirbach, to. a former Russian message about the submission of Article 5 and others of tlie Brest Treaty to a Conference, that the German Government agreed to the proposal, to form a Corn-mission for the purpose, and asked for Russian representatives with plenipotentiary powers to go to Berlin, and confer at the Admiralty.On April. 25th Baron von dem Busche replied to a Russian Wireless message that the German Government agrees to the frontier line mentioned, in the Peace Treaty being established by a German-Russian Commission, without delay. Pskov is proposed for preparatory work, which must begin on May 1.6th.Mr. Wardrop on April 24th (received.26th.) reported the wireless communications between M. Chicherin and Berlin about the Fleet and the Brest Treaty, in one of which Chicherin asks Germany to guarantee the safety of the Black Sea Fleet against attack, as it is understood, that Sebastopol is blocked by submarines, and threatened on the land side. The Fleet had been ordered to remain in harbour, movements, having been forbidden by von dem Bussche by wireless. -[The War Cabinet learned on reliable authority on May 1st that the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the fortress of Sebastopol had hoisted - the Ukraine flag. The Admiral appointed by the Bolshevist Government was said to have proposed to hold a conference with the General Commanding German troops in the Crimea.]Courland. On April 27th German Wireless reported that the &quot;German Chief of the Administration&quot; had proclaimed to the &quot;Courland Diet&quot; that the Kaiser &quot;is prepared to recognise the Duchy of Courland as a free and independent State, and to conclude in the name of the German Empire such State treaties with Courland as will guarantee the close economic and military connection of the two countries.&quot;Lithuania. Sir II. Rumbold on April 25th reported on. good, authority, that the German military authorities will not allow lierr Erzberger to go to Lithuania.Roland. Air. Woodhouse on April 22nd. (received April 27th) forwarded a report based on good, authority that Germany and Russia had contracted a special, treaty about Poland at Brest-Litovsk. He quotes the chief points embodied in the Treaty, which includes the provision that Russia undertakes at the Peace Conference to give support to a contention on the part of Germany that the question of Poland is a German, and not an international, question.Ukraine. Mr. Wardrop on April 19th (received April 26th) reported, on the authority of the Moscow Press, that there was serious disagreement between the Germans and the Ukraine Rada, and that the Germans were striving to dismiss the Rada. M. Chicherin protested by wireless to Berlin on April 25th that the German-Ukraine offensive was still continuing to Kursk, and- into the Crimea. Count Mirbach declared that the German Government was still observing the Peace Treaty. [German Wireless of April 27th proclaimed that &quot; the German-Ukrainian advance against Kursk continues.   The railway line has been occupied.&quot;]1On April 29th Russian Wireless issued a message signed Boguslavsky, addressed to the &quot; German-Ukrainian High Command of Armies operating in Ukrainia,&quot; on. behalf of the Voronesh Provincial Executive Committee, asking for negotiations for an armistice within their territory.On the same date German Wireless reported that the German delegation in Kieff for negotiations with the Ukrainian Republic about mutual exchange of goods had   Mr. Wardrop reported on good authority on April 24th (received May 1st) that the line front Sostov to Voronesh was in immediate danger of being cut.
closed its labours, and the Treaty consisted of a series of claims which included some affecting grain, vegetables, fodder, seeds, eggs, animals for meat, and iron ores. [See also under Russia.&apos;]Rumania. Lord Bertie on April 26th forwarded a report from the Allied Ministers that, in the new situation brought about by the peace treaty, they would be prevented for the future from sending wireless messages in cypher. Since April 20th their telegrams have also been refused on the score of congestion of the line.It appears from German Wireless of April. 20th-29th that von Kuhlmann and Baron Burian left Berlin for Bucharest on. April. 26th, and arrived there on the 29th. Before leaving Berlin, von Kuhlmann made confidential reports to the leaders of the Reichstag parties about the Bucharest negotiations, and his health, by that time, &quot;had been completely restored.&quot; [This disposes of the rumour pat forward that he had used the plea of ill-health in refusing the Emperor Charles&apos;&quot; hospitality when passing through Vienna.]Germany. Strong corroboration has been received from, several sources of Sir II. Rumbokbs report of last -week thai offers will shortly be made by Germany to discuss peace, whatever may be the result of her great offensive. It is further reported that propaganda on the subject is specially directed to prepare the Allies, especially the United States, for the proposals to be put forward. . Accounts differ as to the terms she would be prepared to accept, but there is nothing to show that, as long as the military party retain the ascendancy, anything but a &quot; strong &quot; German peace, based on the assumption of German victory, is likely to be offered. In this connection several reports have reached the Foreign Office to the effect that the economic blockade&quot; is pressing very hard upon Germany, and as long as we hold the seas she is not likely to be saved even by a military success.On April 27th Sir Id. Rumbold drew attention to a letter in the Geneva Journal from Dr. Muklon, lately of Krupps, demolishing the German attempts to justify their violation of Belgian neutrality in 1914. There are unconfirmed rumours that Prince Lichnowsky was at Zurich on about April 24th.Sir II. Rumbold quotes Press reports that von Kuhlmann, when on his way through Vienna, did not ask for an audience with the Emperor Charles, and excused himself from dining at Court when invited. Reports from several other sources point to strained, relationship between the Kaiser and the Emperor Charles.[See also under Rumania, and under Austria-Hungary.]Austria-Hungary. ddie Emperor Charles&apos; personal idea of peace conditions is reported, on fairly reliable authority, to be as follows:- -France to receive the French-speaking districts of Lorraine. No war indemnity on either side. Belgium to be restored in exchange for German Colonies, due same authority reports that Austria would withdraw from the war if these terms were accepted by the Entente and refused by Germany.Several reports suggest the desirability of keeping Austria strong as a counter-poise to Pan-Germanism. This view is concurred in bv the Vatican (Count de Salis, April 3rd, 19.18).Idte Kaiser is reported, on good authority, to be urging the Emperor Charles to get Prince Sixtus to support the Austrian version of the Emperor Charles&apos; letter, as opposed to the French version, and serious -friction is reported between the two Emperors.German Wireless of April 27th alleged that &quot; cross-currents directed against the alliance of the German Empire (with Austria-Hungary) had been done away with entirely &quot; at an interview between Minister-President von Seidler and a deputation of the Austrian Upper House.On April 29th the Austrian Foreign Office sent a wireless message to Moscow to propose to open negotiations to regulate certain financial matters under Clause 4, Item 3 of the peace treaty with Russia.[See also under Rumania, and Germany.]Turkey.   Several reports, received through Sir II. Rumbold (April 24th-26th) point to Turkish discontent with the Germans and a desire for peace. Also to probable friction with Bulgaria on their respective claims in peace discussions.[See also under Sweden.]
ISBulgaria. See under Turkey. Bulgaria is said to want more than the Dobrudja,. especially the Adrianople-Dedeagateh Railway, aud Bulgaria also is reported to be dissatisfied with Germany.France. In connection with a proposed conference in Switzerland of the &quot; Central organisation for a durable peace,&quot; Lord Bertie on April 26th-28th reported that the French Government had no intention of departing from their policy announced in November 1917 as applied to granting visas to French citizens to attend conferences on peace. [Sir Ff. Rumbold was so informed on May 1st. The British Government adopts the same attitude.] The Seine Union of WorkmeiTs Syndicates publish an appeal in Humanitdfor Syndical organisations to be ready for a generaljand unanimous manifestation of the proletariat in favour of public announcement of war aims, and the suppression of secret diplomacy. Deputy Sambat, in the same paper, recommends the Allies not to refuse to negotiate after the present German offensive.Switzerland.- With reference to the recent statement that the Swiss Minister in London had wired to his Government on August 2nd, 1914, that Great. Britain would declare Avar, fthis statement has now been officially denied by the Swiss President (report by Sir 1:1. Rumbold, April 24th), ancPthe Director of the Political Department, who was in London at the&apos; time, states that the Swiss Minister &quot; throughout the crisis &quot; reported that the British Government made &quot; every endeavour to keep peace.&quot; [This disposes of another attempt by the German propagandists to camouflage the weakness af their case. The Swiss Government has suppressed all further Press telegrams alluding to the subject.]Sweden, Reports have been received (Sir E. HoAvard, April 27th) of an impending visit to Stockholm of Turkish Socialists to publish propaganda on alleged massacres of Turks by Armenians ; also proposals for Greeks to go to Stockholm to conduct counter propaganda on Turkish persecutions. The suggestion has been made by the Foreign Office to Sir E. Howard (April 30th) that the massacres of Armenians AAdiolesale by the Turks are so thoroughly proved that it will be easy to arrange locally to refute the proposed Turkish propaganda.Morocco. The Political Intelligence Department calls attention to the fact -that Germany has begun to use the whole Morocco cpiestion as a move in her diplomatic offensive. The old sentimental soreness in Spain about Gibraltar is again being exploited, (see former Reports).Persia. -The Foreign Office learns on good authority that the presence of certain Persians in Berlin is significant in connection with reports that Germany and Turkey are trying to cause Persia to join in the Avar. Sir C. Marling was so informed on April 30th.
