PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.&apos; GENERAL-Sinkings. According to the War Trade intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons.gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing-ships, reported, lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period May 24th-30th:-:inclusive, was 52,610 tons gross, of which 42,931 were British, as compared with 65,920 tons gross, of which 35,541 were British, reported last week.Convoys. The Ministry of Shipping reports that, of 9,389 ships (66,618,100 deadweight capacity) convoyed, homeward, and outward, up to May 25th, 1918, the losses were 103 ships (742,900 deadweight capacity), being a percentage of 1;09 of ships and 1&apos; 1 of deadweight capacity.German Prize Court Regulations and Dutch Shipping. Sir W. Townley reports that the Netherlands Government has instructed its Minister in Berlin to protest strongly against the interpretation placed by the German Government upon its new Prize Regulation as affecting Dutch shipping (see Report No. 70). It is pointed out (inter- edict) that that the forcible requisition of part of tire Dutch mercantile fleet furnishes no evidence that the remaining part (sailing under a neutral flag) can be presumed to be aiding the enemy, and that it has been sent to sea in the interests of enemy warfare. Sir W. Townley further reports that the. Netherlands Government, in withdrawing its prohibition of sailings to Scandinavia, denies that it sanctions the contents of decfarations made to the German authorities by the firms concerned, and maintains its attitude towards the German system of safe-conducts. According to Ilandelsblad of May 30th, attempts have been made to obtain the issue of safe-conducts for the three ships lying ready to sail to America in exchange for the grain ships, but the German Government refuses to allow their issue by wray of exception to its proposed general regulation.British Prisoners at Groningen. According to a Press message dated 29th May, from Amsterdam, the British prisoners interned at Groningen have recently expressed dissatisfaction with food and other conditions. It is stated that certain, promises of improvement have been made.British-German. Negotiations for Exchange and Internment of Prisoners. The War Cabinet has arranged that the British Delegation to The Hague for negotiating the proposed agreement with Germany, regarding exchange, internment, and general treatment of prisoners, shall be headed by the Right Hon. Sir George Cave, K.C., M.P., Home Secretary. General Friecirich will be Plead of the German Delegation, of which Prince Hermann von Hatzfeld will be a member. Mr. Vredenburch will preside at the Conference. Sir Ah Townley has communicated the programme of the German Delegates, and the War Cabinet has settled the terms on which, from, the British side, the negotiations will be based.German-Italian Agreement for Exchange of Prisoners. With reference to the German-Italian agreement for exchange of prisoners (see Report No. 70), the Foreign Office learns that no negotiations on these lines have as yet taken place between Italy and. Austria-Hungary, nor would any such exchange, so far as affecting fit prisoners, be welcomed by the Italian Government.Unwounded Prisoners. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4715) dated May 3.1st, the Army Council deprecates the indiscriminate sympathy claimed by certain sections of the Press for unwounded equally with wounded prisoners. It is pointed &quot;out that while soldiers who are captured owing to their being incapacitated by wounds are deserving of the most sympathetic treatment on their release, those officers and men wdio surrender while unwounded should be looked upon as having failed to carry out their duty as soldiers to the full and as having fallen short of the example set by their comrades in days gone by and during the present war, who did their duty to the last.Vladivostock.- The Foreign Office learns that on May 22nd a big demonstration took place at Vladivostock, public bodies and workmen numbering 10,000 protesting against the Soviet taking over municipal powers (see Report No. 09) ; speeches were delivered against Bolshevist tyranny and in. favour of universal suffrage.   There
was great enthusiasm and no disorder. It is improbable that the Bolshevists will be able to cany out efficiently the municipal functions which they have usurped,-since all competent employes have resigned. The magistrates, having declined to recognise the Soviet, are to be dismissed. As the result of Bolshevist interference in various branches of administration, chaos and discontent are general; resentment is growing amongst all classes, notably amongst the workmen throughout the maritime province; and there seems to be a sincere, desire both in Eastern and Western Siberia for a stable democratic Government. Russian Wireless of May 31st issues a wild appeal from the Bolshevist Government to the workmen and peasants of -all Russia, declaring that counter-revolutionary forces throughout the country are taking advantage of the critical food situation to restore the regime of the landlords and bourgeoisie. &quot;If we, with weapons in. our hand, secure for ourselves bread until the next harvest, then shall we be unconquerable and the Socialistic Republic will be established for ever. A. final heroic effort is necessary.&quot; The same message and a further one of &quot;dune 3rd angrily malign the Ozecho-SIovak forces now in Russia. A. large number has already arrived at Vladivostock, and. more are on the way; others are understood to be proceeding to Archangel; these troops are anxious to -oppose the Germans on the Western front, rather than in. the East, but, while they are unwilling to interfere in Russian internal affairs, they are nevertheless much incensed against the Bolshevists, who propose to disarm them before they leave the country. Trotsky has issued, an order prohibiting their movement eastward, and com-manding that those who surrender and are afterwards found in possession of arms shall be executed on the spot, while those who have to be disarmed by force must be imprisoned.. It is reported that the Bolshevist forces opposing Semenoff include an Austro-German cavalry brigade (1,000 men) and 3,000 infantry. At the Supreme War Council an agreement has been reached upon the conditions under which Japanese intervention in Siberia would be encouraged by France, Great Britain, and Italy.ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.Resignation of Baron de Broqucville. The Belgian Prime Minister, Baron de Broqueville, having tendered his resignation, King Albert has given the direction of affairs to M. Coorem.au, former President of the Chamber of Deputies. Baron de Broqueville&apos;s resignation was not caused by any divergence of policy in interior or exterior affairs, but it is merely the result of some differences of opinion concerning the methods of government. M, Cooroman takes charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to Avhich are annexed the attributions of the Ministry of National Reconstruction.   .-;Pan-German Designs on Belgium. Admiral von Tirpitz, speaking at dusseldorf on May 26th, said that Germany must keep Belgium in her bauds economically, politically, and militarily.&apos; The decision could only come in tlie West, and at Dusselclorf on the Rhine it could be more easily&apos;&apos; understood than in other parts of the country that German industry could not be maintained unless it were able to assert itself by sea and throughout the world. Neither Central Europe, nor Northern Europe, nor the East could supply Germans with the raw materials requisite for their industry. For this thej&apos;&apos; needed the sea, freed from the political tyranny of Anglo-Saxon power. It was a Utopian idea that Germany could win the friendship of the Anglo-Saxons,&quot; or -obtain recognition of German equality in the economy of the world, otherwise than by power. Germany needed a minimum of power, but that minimum consisted in the political remoulding of the world by the annexation of the old Burgunclian district to the German Empire in some form or other (and see Reports Nos. 62-61).Deportations and Forced .Labour. The Belgian Government has sent a protest to all the Bowers who signed, the Hague Convention, against the continuance of the practice of deportations and of forced labour try the German authorities in the occupied portions of Belgium (and. see Report No. 67).BRAZIL.British Trade with Brazil. Sir A. Peel recommends the continued purchase through British firms, of British food recpiiyements from Brazil ; and emphasises the
importance of maintaining and strengthening commercial sympathy between Brazil, and-Great- Britain. Lord Reading intimates the readiness of the United Slates-Government to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s, Government in measures calculated to eliminate the dominating German interests in Brazil.   (See Report No. 09.)Goal. The Foreign Office informs Sir A. Peel as to the circumstances in which, it was found necessary to defer provision of coal to the S.S. Punts (see Report-No. 70), and. in the light of. which the intervention of the French Authorities appears regrettable. His Majesty&apos;s Government now hopes to be able to supply the coal, itself.CHINA.Deportation of Enemy Aliens. The Foreign Office has received representations from tlie Vatican (see Reports Nos. G9 and 70) and. the Nino- of Spain regarding the proposed deportation of enemy aliens from China and the measures of retaliation threatened by the German Government. In communicating these for the opinion of the relative Allied Governments (except the Chinese, which does not appear to be directly concerned), the Foreign Office reviews the facts justifying the Allied action, and points out the preferability, on. humanitarian grounds, of Australia to China as a place of internment for Europeans. Sir 0. Greene reports- that with regard to--reprisals Japan, is in a very strong position as compared with Germany. Sir J.: Jordan urges that great discouragement would be caused to Germany and great encourage-meut to China if the deportations could be expedited by the immediate provision of adequate tonnage. The Ministry of Shipping states that the Japanese are providing two vessels and. the British Admiralty one, for the conveyance of as many as possible.China and the Bolshevist Government. Russian Wireless of May 30th records a Note from the Bolshevist Foreign Commissary to the Government of China protesting against the enlistment of Chinese detachments under Semenoff, and his use of Chinese territory as a refuge and base : &quot; In case the Peking Government should consider itself impotent in the matter of suppressing, the criminal activities of bands of brigands coming from Manchuria, the People/s Commissariat begs the Peking-Government to permit the Councils armed forces to crush these criminals without the support of Chinese regular; troops.&quot; The Note continues : &quot;At the same time, and in the interests of Chinese citizens, the People&apos;s Commissariat begs the Peking Government to give it an authorisation to enter China, and to facilitate the journey of all the CounciPs consular officials to their posts. The Chinese Mission has been already informed of their appointment, by a Note of April 8th, 191.8, No. 100. Then People&apos;s Commissariat hopes that all. efforts made by it with the view to establishing relations of friendship and good, neighbour-ship with the Chinese people, so soon as authority has been taken over by the peoples of the Federal, and Socialist- Republic of Russia, will be appreciated by the Peking Government, and that the Peking-Government will show in a practical manner its resolve to consolidate normal relations between, two neighbouring peoples.&quot;   (See also Report No. (56.)Reported Japanese Loan Agreement, With reference to the rumour of. negotiations for a Japanese loan, to China secured upon a tobacco monopoly (see Report No. 70), Sir J. Jordan reports that he has now been informed by the Japanese Minister that this is unfounded. The Japanese Legation in Peking has also issued an official denial. It is generally believed in Peking that negotiations of this. character were indeed initiated, but subsequently abandoned owing to the publicity given to the matter.Si,no-Japanese Agreement, Sir J. Jordan reports that the Chinese papers have published a summary of the Sino-Japanese Agreement (see Report No. 69), and also the Notes exchanged by the Chinese and Japanese Governments.COSTA. RICA.Great Britain and Costa. Rica, The Foreign Office instructs Lord Derby to. convey to the Costa Rican Minister in Paris, in reply to his message of solidarity (see Report No. 70), an assurance of the gratification with which Plis Majesty&apos;s Government has received the news of the welcome accession of Costa Pica to the cause of liberty and humanity. .,
FRANCE.Government and the Military Situation. -Lord Derby reports that after a-number of interpellations in the Chamber on June 4th regarding the military situation, it was decided by 377 votes to 110 to accept the demand of the Government that the discussion should be indefinitely adjourned, M. Clemenceau having made it a vote of confidence. His spirited tone and line eulogies of the conduct of the. troops were appreciated by the great majority.False Rumours regarding British Help. The Foreign Office learns that considerable mischief is being caused in France by allegations that British troops who ought to be in France are retained in England for fear of invasion.German Propaganda against M. Clemenceau. German Wireless of May 31st refers to &quot; CleinenceaAs reign of despotism &quot; as &quot; assuming more and more brutal forms,&quot; and quotes attacks made upon dum by Renaudel in Humanite and by Jfouhaux, leader of the Confederation Generale du Travail.   (See also Report No. 60.)GUATEMALA.Guatemala and the War. A Mission is being despatched to Washington, headed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to put forward claims regarding the disputed boundary between Honduras and Guatemala, which, were it not for the United States Government, might have become a cause of war between the two countries. The declaration of war by Guatemala on Germany, Avhich took place on the 23rd April, was expressed in such indefinite terms that it would appear that the intention was to give Germany as little offence as possible. One of the reasons which may have influenced the decision Avas the threatened withdrawal of United States ships from Guatemalan trade. The declaration of Avar was passed hurriedly through the Assembly, probably with a view to obtaining food supplies, money, and other necessaries which the United States can. only spare for the Allies. Guatemala is -also anxious to secure representation at the Beace Conference.ITALY. -Food Situation. Italian Wireless of June 5th reports an improvement in the food situation A&apos;thanks to-the Governments energetic actions and the Allies&apos;cordial help.&quot; The restriction in meat consumption, and the requirements of the army and of agricultural, labourers will, however, necessitate an increased demand for grain. Au appeal is therefore made for the co-operation of all citizens, and the conviction is expressed that it will be possible to tide over the interval between the old and new harvests.Manifesto by Italian Socialist Union. Italian Wireless of June 2nd reports:   &quot; The Committee of the Italian Socialist Party have issued a manifesto to comrades, restating their principle that the Avar between classes cannot transcend patriotic ideals and that to-day Socialists desire the national independence free of all foreign domination. Therefore, the Socialistic Union affirms that an energetic war policy is the best means of hastening peace. The manifesto concludes by stating that the victory of the Allies against their common enemies will be a Socialist victory ; because it will mark the advent of a just and durable peace. In this sense the Socialistic Union means to exert itself in the country &quot; (and see Report No. 68).Italy and the Latin-American States. Italian Wireless of May 30th reports :  Under the patronage of the Under Secretary of State, Signor Gallenga, a meeting of eminent politicians and business men will be held to deliberate upon presenting to the Government some practical proposals for itensifying economic relations and relations in general between Italy and the Latin-American States.JAPAN.German Propaganda and Japan. German Wireless of May 31st quotes a recent article in the Daily Mail as describing the Japanese as &quot;real-politicians,&quot; Avho attach no importance to British utterances about democracy and idealism, but will only estimate the value of.the Anglo-Japanese Alliance by the substantial achievements of the British Empire in the Avar. German Wireless interprets this as an &quot; interesting admission that solid facts speak in favour of Germany.&quot;POB.TUGAL.Policy of the New Administration. In a despatch dated May 17th Sir L. Carnegie reports : &quot; One of the first acts of the President of the Republic after his5873 -Its . B
election and proclamation was to reconstitute Ids Government, &quot;with the object, so it appears, of &quot;eliminating certain pronounced Monarchist elements, and of making it thoroughly Republican in sentiments.&quot; . . . . &quot;As an instance of- the change in the relations between the Church and State I may mention a Requiem Service for Portuguese soldiers killed in the war, held on the 15th instant in the Cathedral with great pomp and ceremony. The Patriarch of Lisbon officiated, and President Sidonio. Paes attended, taking his place in the former Royal box, this being the first occasion, that a President of this Republic has taken part in any religious ceremony. Many members of the Government and a large number of military and naval officers, the Diplomatic Body, and thousands of persons from all classes of society were present.&quot;UNITED STATES.War Taxes. President Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress on May 27th to ask for the immediate passing of new war taxes, ddie speech, which occupied less than .15 minutes, began by calling upon Congress to eliminate politics in connection with this measure. The principal increases in taxation should be on incomes, war profits and luxuries. There need be no hesitation in taxing the country if it were taxed justly, ddie President declared that he could not guarantee, proper administration of the Treasury unless the question was settled at once. It would be unsound policy to raise too large a proportion of revenue by loans, ddie SOO,000,OOOL now provided by taxation was insufficient to sustain the greatly enlarged Budget, ddie President ended with an appeal to the patriotism of Congress, and said that there must be no pause or intermission, ddie great enterprise must, on the contrary, be pushed with greater and greater energy, ddie volume of American might must steadily be augmented until there could be no question of resisting it.Party Politics and the November Elections. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4673) dated May 23rd, the Political Intelligence Department examines the &quot;Republican criticisms of the Administration&apos;and the prospects of the Republican Party. &quot;No safe conclusion is possible about the coming election. But the international aspect of the situation can be more clearly defined. Both parties are wholeheartedly &apos; in the war.&apos; ddie elections will revolve round no broad issue of Foreign Policy nor affect the strength of the Uni.ted* States as a belligerent. Pacifist opinion will have to seek refuge with the Socialists or with the &apos; Non Partisan League,&apos; a new agrarian party in the Middle West.&quot; The Memorandum emphasises the importance of eliminating-suspicions as to the purposes of Great Britain in inviting the co-operation of the United States both in war and post-war economic measures.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Internal Conditions. According to information received by the Foreign Office-there is famine in many parts of Austria and thousands are dying of starvation in Vienna. The population is stated to be in despair, and it is added that any order for a great offensive against Italy would be met by a general revolt, ddie Emperor is regarded as a mere tool of the Germans, who have complete control. An account of conditions in Bohemia, appears in the Times of May 31st at page 5, which also reports an expression by Mr. Lansing of the sympathy of the United States Government with the national aspirations of the Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs for freedom.The Allies and the oppressed Nationalities. At a meeting held at Versailles oii June 3rd the Prime Ministers of the three Allied countries, Great Britain, France -and Italy, agreed to the following declarations : -(1) ddie creation of a united and independent Polish State with free access to thesea constitutes one of the conditions of a solid and just peace and of the rule of right in Europe. (2) The Allied Governments have noted with pleasure the declaration made bythe Secretary of State of the United States Government and desire to associate  themselves  in an expression of  earnest   sympathy  for  the.nationalistic aspirations towards freedom of the Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-SlaA&apos; peoples.His Majesty&apos;s Government has   now recognised the Czecho-Slovak   National -Consul in the same manner as has been done by the French and Italian Governments,,
according it the same political rights concerning the civil affairs of Czecho-SIovaks as have been conceded to the Polish National Committee. Recognition is also accorded to the Ozccho-Slovak Army as an organised unit operating in the Allied cause. [See also Reports Nos. 67 (under &quot;Italy&quot; and. &quot; Austria-Hungary &quot;) and 68 (under   Italy &quot;).]The Austro-German Pact. In a Memorandum (CP. 4727) dated May 30th the Political Intelligence Department discusses tlie projected Ansfro-German Agreement. The four main points, as represented for the benefit of German public opinion, are (1) a twenty- or twenty-five-year term instead of the old six-year term. ; (2) alliance against the threat of a future coalition from, whatever quarter (the original Russian menace being no longer formidable) ; (3) co-ordination, to be continued into peace-time, of transport, food supply, mobilisation, and munitioning, on a basis of complete parity, with the understanding that in the event of another war the two armies shall act like one body ; (4) permanent community of economic interests. The contemplated military unification has been criticised by Hungarians, who are jealous of the special characteristics of their national, army ; and by the German Government Socialists through V orwdrts, which asks whether harmony is to be preserved by military head-quarters, since evidently a common German-Anstro-Hungarian Parliament is not, intended. With regard to the economic aspects of the Treaty, Count Hertling declares that the Central Empires want no more than their &quot; place in the sun.&quot; &quot; We desire to make the most of the possibilities which our union implies-nothing more.&quot; This statement may lie read in the light of a recent, article in the Milnchener Neuesle Nachrichten advocating &quot; indirect war indemnities &quot; in the West on the model of the Rumanian Treaty, and of l)ernbnrg&apos;s advice in the Vienna A7eue Freda Prcsse, that Germany should &quot; strike her suction-roots deep into the heart of Asia.&quot;Referring to the welcome accorded to the Waffenbund by Austrian clericals, a Vienna message quotes from an article in the Tiroler Tagcblait, by &quot; one of the most eminent, Catholic political writers, Professor Michael Haidegger, the Papal Chamberlain.&quot; He says : &quot; Masses of German people, as a result of the Waffenbund, now stand in case of need behind the Germans of Austria, and will not permit Czech and South-Slav cupidity to indulge in unlimited orgies. Privileged, high treason must cease, and these misled peoples must, so far see reason that it shall be possible for the State and its orderly functions lo exist. Should they not voluntarily decide to do so, there are ways and means available, under Giermany&apos;s guarantee, to give proper validity to raisons dlelat against, unbridled nationalism. That is the import of the decisions arrived at at German Main Headquarters.&quot; A manifesto was issued on May 26th an Innsbruck by the Pan-Germans of the Tyrol. Tyrol is described as a German country, which must remain the sentinel of Germanism, against Italy. Those in Austria who do not wish to recognise the Austrian Government should leave the country. Every political amnesty must be henceforth excluded. Only by crushing Italian, irredentisin can the Austrian State remain united.According- to information received by the Foreign Office, Austria is anxious to make her acceptance of the Treaty conditional upon an Austrian solution of the Polish question ; to this Germany objects (1) on. industrial grounds, (2) through fear of its reaction upon the Ukraine, (3) through fear of creating a new irredentism in Prussian Poland, and (4) because it would operate against the complete Gorganisation of Austria. It is further reported that Germany demands that her Allies should so increase their agricultural, production as to render middle Europe self-sufficing ; also that post-war exports rand imports of industrial products and raw materials should be centralised and rationed. To these proposals objection appears to be taken by various interests in Austria Hungary. German Wireless announces that Count Burian. will arrive in. Berlin on June Pith to continue the negotiations ; it also refers to a general economic conference opened on May 30th at Baden, near Vienna, at which German (including Bavarian and Saxon), Austrian and Hungarian represen-tatives attended.-   GERMANY.German,]/ and Russian Trade. Recent information from a reliable source gives an account of German financial activities, undertaken with a view to acquire control of Russian trade after the war. It is said that Copenhagen is being used as a head-quarters for the work, Geheimrat Mendelssohn, a well-known German banker, having succeeded in obtaining control over the Copenhagen branch, of some Christiania bank. The principal objects of attack are the metal industry, and various railways, banks, and steamship companies.   Already large numbers of shares in such concerns have
been bought, their Russian holders often selling at panic prices for fear of Bolshevist confiscations.    Of the railways, special attention has been given to that running southwards towards Turkestan and to the Troitska&apos; Railway (a line from Cheliabinsk to Troitsk, which serves a rich mineral district).   Of the banks, those particularly aimed at are the International Bank in Petrograd and the Russian Asiatic Bank.   The Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company, whose headquarters are in Odessa, and whose fleet is understood to be already in the possession of the Germans, is likewise   eagerly   sought   after   by Germany   with  a   view  to  its   control.     In addition to some 69 modern steamers and 92 sailing vessels, the company owns coal mines, shipyards, and docks.   It is also stated that the Germans are aiming at the   eventual  use of the Russian Baltic vessels to sail   under some neutral flag  in the Pacific in  competition, with  the  Japanese   and Americans.     It  is further reported, that the Germans are attempting to obtain a commanding position . in the timber trade of  Russia and Finland, to the exclusion of Great  Britain. Sir B. Howard learns that IIerr Bockermann, who has been, officiating during the war as financial adviser to the German Legation in Stockholm, is proceeding to Moscow&apos; to take up a similar position under Count Mirbach. . Herr Bockermann was formerly a director of the Junker Bank in Moscow.   Russian Wireless of May 30th refers to two Commissions proposed by Count Mirbach for the immediate approval of the Bolshevist Government.   The first, whose functions are not, specified, is to consist of &quot; His Excellency von Kriege ; the Director of the Imperial Treasury, von Schroecler ; the Vice-President of the Reichsbank, von Glasenap ; and the banker, von Mendelsohn. Tlie Imperial Government is of the opinion that this Commission is indispensable.&quot; The   other  Commission &quot;would   be   charged with the elaboration of  questions concerning the exchange of goods, and the placing of German capital for increasing Russian efficiency.   The Imperial Government accepts the proposal  of  selecting Moscow as the place of meeting for this second Commission.&quot;   By Wireless of the same date, the Bolshevist Government issues to its representatives in Stockholm, London aud Berne and &quot; to all in Foreign Countries &quot; a denial of the report that the Moscow negotiations have been started with the object of giving over to Germany the control of the Trans-Siberian Railway as far as Irkutsk (see Report No. 70), and asserts that the story has been issued, by counter-revolutionaries &quot; to put the&quot; Allies in the way of breaking off relations with Russia.&quot;War Aims. A body, calling itself the Free Committee for a German Workers&apos; Peace, held a conference at Bremen on May 1.9th, at which 70 representatives from all parts of Germany attended. Telegrams were sent to the Emperor and the Imperial Chancellor demanding (1) guarantees for Germany&apos;s frontiers ; (2) territory in which Germans can settle ; (3) freedom of the seas ; (4) a war indemnity. According to the Kblnische Zeitung, Admiral von Tirpitz, speaking at a meeting of the Fatherland Party at Cologne on May 27th, said that Germans were faced by. the fateful question whether they should be a ruling or a helot people. An unfavourable peace would bring a fresh, war upon Germany. It seemed doubtful whether there could be any. neutrals in a new European war. Holland, as well as Norway, would probably have to side against Germany. In regard to naval and military affairs Germany could not hold her Heligoland corner or carry out a U-boat war without Flanders.Germany and Zionism. -The Daily Review (E.P.S.) of May 30th reports : -Georg Gothein, member of the Reichstag, &quot;writes in the Berliner Tageblatt (May 12th) on &quot; Pro Palaestina,&quot; the name of a society recently formed in Berlin (mainly by Christians) to encourage the Jewish colonisation of Palestine with Jews. This society-is not Zionist in the popular sense, and Gothein draws a distinction between Western and Eastern Jews, the former being Jews only as regards religion, whereas, the latter are Jews throughout. Thus, German, French, and English Jews are respectively German, French, and. English ; whereas, farther East the language is Yiddish, and the manners and customs are peculiar to the Jews, and the whole thought is essentially Talmudical here the Ukrainian or Polish. Jew is simply not a Ukrainian or a Pole. , The Zionism of the Western Jews maybe partly a - reaction against anti-Semitism ; it is a &quot; romantic-religions idealism,&quot; which never can be turned to practical colonising aims, as is suggested by the history of William Penn and the Puritans of New England. The situation of the Western Jew is entirely different, from that of the Eastern, whose miserable condition Gothein presents only one side of the question is familiar, wdiose exile is lightened only by the idea of a return to the Promised Land. At first these Eastern Jews, to whom agricultural work had been almost everywhere forbidden, did not make good colonists; but earlier failures have been redeemed, as efforts were made to give them a preliminary training
&quot;Since the capture of Jerusalem, the English with that native adroitness of theirs-have set before the world the picture of a future independent Jewish National&apos; State of: Palestine, in reality, they are only concerned to make the Indian Ocean into an English lake, aud so throw a bridge from Egypt to India over Palestine, Mesopotamia, Persia and Afghanistan. Palestine, as a so-called. Jewish State, would he merely an. English colony. It is to the interest of the Eastern. Jews, as also of the Germans, that the English plan should fail, and that England should not pocket the fruits of the prolonged labours of German-Jewish, culture-pioneers.&quot; The English attempt to win the sympathies of the Jews of all lands must be foiled by the German Jews, and by the Germans. This will require an understanding with the Turkish authorities, who, in the past, have been thoroughly agreeable to German requests. Capital, colonies and brains are necessary in order to increase the exports and improve Turkey&apos;s unfavourable trade and financial balance, and there is every readiness to encourage Jewish settlements and to see in Palestine a national and culturally independent Jewish community. No doubt the work of colonisation will, take time and toil; but while Palestine is for those whose religious zeal moves&apos; them thereto &quot;the great mass of the Jews will as before remain in the lands where their cradle has stood.&quot; &apos; The aim must be to make Jews citizens of the State, with equal, rights, and socially not inferior to people of other origin. Put it is still an open question whether this will succeed in the East, as it has in Germany and the West. In any case, the Jewish colonisation of Palestine is &quot;a culture-work a German political task.&quot; (And. see Reports Nos. 58, 60, 04, 66-680Shortage of Textiles. The Allied Governments are examining the possibility of a more drastic restriction of the supply of textile products from neutral sources to the Central Powers, who are already suffering from an extreme shortage in this respect.   (See also under &quot; Switzerland.&quot;)The Cinema Industry. The Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung of April 23rd states : &quot; Since the formation of the Universum Film Company, the movement .towards concentration in the film, industry has made further progress. According to the Lichthlld-Buhne, a Rhenish cinematograph company has been formed with a capital of Mk. 5J mill., with the support of the Banner Banking Association in Cologne .... It is starting branch businesses in Scandinavia and Austria-Hungary, and preparing to do so in Switzerland and Russia. Besides these, two further companies are. contemplated in Central and South Germany.&quot; According to a report received, Germany is now independent of other countries for all cinematographic materials. The industry will, be extensively applied to the purposes of propaganda in. foreign countries, both during and after the war, particularly in the advertisement of German manufactures.Germany and the Bolshevists. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, the Germans have undertaken to support Bolshevist Missions in neutral countries in consideration of the disarmament of the Black Sea Fleet.A nil-French Propaganda. The Foreign Office is informed that stories of French cruelty to prisoners are being officially circulated in Germany, with the frequent addition that the person threatened was saved by the intervention of an. Englishman. It is commonly stated in. Munich that the offensive against the British has been declared by .1 linden burg to have been a mistake, since Germany would ultimately have to come to an understanding with them.NEUTRAL GROUP.ALBANIA, &apos;Italian Influence. Italian Wireless of May 30th reports: &quot; The English explorer, Savage Landor, has arrived iu Rome from Albania, ,where he said he received excellent impressions of Italian work there. Poads, schools, and sanitary institutions have, in a brief time, transformed the country, which has been oppressed by Ottoman domination for five centuries.&quot; &apos; .ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.     .        * -British Special Mission. The Foreign Office is informed that after a thoroughly satisfactory visit to Uruguay, where official and public sympathy with and enthusiasm for the Allied cause were manifest, the British Special Mission arrived on May 31st0st3-1&apos;z. c
at Buenos Aires, where it received a reception of unprecedented warmth. Salutes of 21 guns were exchanged between H.M.S. Newcastle and the Almiranbe Brown, and the latter further saluted the Ambassadors flag with 19 guns. The Mission was met outside the harbour by crowded tugs, and the port was dressed and. massed with people. The Mission received a remarkable, popular demonstration in the streets. Sir M. de Bunsen was received very cordially by the President on June 1st, and the Argentine Government has expressed its gratification at the auspicious visit..Argentine Tievublic and Germany. A Press telegram dated May 29th states that the Argentine Government has agreed to recognise Count von Donhpff, Secretary to the German Legation, as Charge d&apos;Affaires in accordance with, his request based upon his desire that diplomatic relations might be restored, between Germany and Argentina.DENMARK.Opening of Parliament. The Press reports that the opening of the Rigsdag took place on May 28th in the presence of all the members of the Royal Family, a large number of members of the Kigsdag, and the members of the Diplomatic Body. Each of the belligerent Powers was represented by one member of the respective legations, ddie King, in the course of his speech, said :  &quot;This is the first time that the Pigsdag has been elected in conformity with the new constitution of June 5th, 1915, which gives to every citizen, women as well as men, equal right to share in legislation. In another way, moreover, this day is of great import, because for the first time for nearly 3d- years the Rigsdag has met in this historic spot (the rebuilt castle of. Christiansborg), which is now the residence of your King, the seat of law and justice, and is free to you for year debates, ddie policy of strict and impartial neutrality which the Government has maintained since the opening of hostilities has been entirely approved by the citizens of the Country through the intermediary of all the parties of the Rigsdag, and it has been appreciated by the belligerent Powers. The Government will strictly continue this policy along the lines followed hitherto, and we hope that the efforts under the banner of neutrality to assure the provisioning of the country and industrial activity will not encounter difficulties which cannot be overcome by means of discussion. It is with sincere pleasure, which .1 know is shared by all Danes, that .1 refer to the happy results of the continually increasing cooperation between the three Scandinavian peoples. With regard, to domestic affairs your labours ought to aim, as they have hitherto done, at the relief of the severe and inevitable distress caused in so many quarters by the world Avar, and I am convinced that the consciousness of the necessity of obtaining what is usefub/for the country will unite even very divergent opinions in a common sentiment in order to reach a. common end. This also applies to the settlement of the relations between Denmark and Iceland, in which I admit that if we, on the side of Denmark, act in full agreement, the negotiations will remove the points in dispute which are preventing a satisfactory and complete understanding.&quot;Danish Socialist Campaign against Entente. Sir R. Paget reports that Social Demokraten, the organ of Mr. Stauuing and Barvus, alias Helphand (see Reports Nos. 50, 54- and 67), are conducting a campaign against certain well-known Danes stated to have assisted various Entente officials in obtaining information regarding Germany. False insinuations are also made against certain British officials. It is somewhat remarkable that the paper should omit to refer to the innumerable German agents in Denmark, who direct their activities, not on by against the Entente powers, but also against Danish interests, e.g., hy giving information leading to the torpedoing of Danish ships. Infractions of Danish neutrality by German agents are frequent, but either such agents are. not;prosecuted or the proceedings are kept out of the Press. (It may be observed that the German officer von Kotze, expelled from Copenhagen in 1916 for espionage, is now again installed there as German Vice-Consul.) Social Demokraten has been strongly pro-German and anti-Ally during the war, as also has the attitude of the Danish Socialist Party (see Reports above quoted). A letter from Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, however, appears in the issue of May 30th, expressing cordial sympathy with Mr. Stauning, and stating that English Socialists in no way complain of the attitude of their Danish comrades.
British Agreement with Iceland. An economic Agreement between. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Iceland lias been signed in London, under which export licences will be resumed for goods required by Iceland from the United Kingdom and the United States within, tlie rations provided fur. (See also Report Nos. 54, 57 and 58.)FINLAND.Finland and (Jerincmy. The Swedish extreme Socialist paper Politiken of -June 1st reports &quot;from a well-informed source&quot; that a secret treaty exists between Finland, and Germany which is still unknown to the Finnish Diet, and according to which the Finnish Senate is pledged (I) to introduce monarchy under a German Prince even against the will of the Diet; (2) to place the Finnish Army under /German command; (A) to refuse definitely to hand over Aland to Sweden; (4) to allow the Germans to establish a naval station on Aland or elsewhere on the Finnish -coast; (5) to give the Germans the right to a commercial port on the Arctic Ocean. The treaty-is also stated, to provide measures against the Finnish Reds. Until the above pledges are fulfilled the Germans are to have the right to keep troops in Finland. (This report is characterised by German Wireless of June 4th as a &quot;liberal invention.&quot;) The Swedish Press of tlie same date publishes a communique from, the French Legation stating that, in view of statements by certain, members of the&apos; Finnish Senate that the monarchical principle would apparently not command a majority in the Landtag demanded by the Constitution, the French Minister has been authorised to inform the Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires in Stockholm that the French Government will not recognise any change of government illegally introduced into Finland. The French Government considers that in making this declaration it -discharges the duty to the Finnish people which it undertook in being the first of the Great Powers to recognise Finland&apos;s independence. Mr. Grove reports that the Swedish and Old. Finnish Parties are in favour of a monarchy, while the Agrarians -and Young Finns oppose it.With regard to the Army, Sir E. Howard reports that the German Staff objected to the retention of General Mannerheim, considering him pro-Ally. A. Stockholm Press message of May 27th from Stockholm reports that the German-trained -Rigor -officers have been undermining the position of the old Finnish aud Russo-Finnish -officers, and have conducted a propaganda for t.he.general introduction into the Finnish Army of the German military system and control. At the same time immense efforts have been made to lessen Swedish control in the Finnish Army. (The Finnish, papers predict the probable resignation with General Mannerheim of the Swedish-speaking officers. Sir E. Howard reports that the General, is now at Stockholm, much upset at the Germanisation of his country under the influence of Sario.) A press message -of May 28th mentions the rumour current in Stockholm ol: &quot; a defensive treaty, with Germany. One condition of this is that Finland shall establish an army of 100,000 men, and that the Finnish Army in the East shall be commanded by Germans in the event of Russia again attacking Germany during the present Avar. German officers are to. be employed as tacticians and instructors in officers&apos; training colleges. It is said that General Mannerheim, the Commander of the White -Guards, was opposed to this agreement, but that 1VI. Svinhufvud, the Finnish Dictator, considered himself bound by it.&quot; As to the Arctic Ocean, Sir E. Howard learns from a Russian source that German, troops in Helsingfors have been speaking -openly of an expedition, against Murmansk, and that they have been moved eastward. Air. Grove also reports considerable movements of German troops about the country. The Nashe Slovo learns from Archangel that the Germans are laying a railway from the Finnish frontier to Petchenga Bay. His Majesty rs Vice-Consul at Kirkeness learns that a force of 2,000 White Finns intends again to attack Petchenga. By Wireless of May 26th the Bolshevist Government sent the following message to its Plenipotentiary,:: Joffe, in Berlin : &quot; Count Mirbach proposed in the name of his Government a basis for peace with Finland. Finland is to cede Ino and Raivola. We are to undertake not to fortify these places, and to cede to Finland, a strip of the Murman region with an outlet to the sea.The Russian  Government accept this offer.....&quot;   With regard to Germancommercial control, the rumour above quoted speaks of an agreement that Germany is to have economic control over Finland for 20 years, and. to finance a series
of new industries and undertakings-in Finland, especially of such as are intended for the production of articles of export to Russia. Sir E. Howard learns that the Deutsche Bank has already established a branch at Helsingfors. Several new banks-are being started in Finland. Politically, according to a report from Mr. Grove, the Finns are at present without independence, and have ceased to mention it. The German Staff has threatened to stop any paper hostile to or critical of German action ; practically no foreign news is received except what is daily handed out by the German. Legation.Finland and Denmark. It is reported from a reliable source that negotiations are in progress between the Finnish Senate and representatives of the Danish Govern-rnent with a view to a commercial agreement between Finland and Denmark, if the proposed agreement is concluded, as seems quite possible, Denmark will send food to. Finland in exchange for other commodities, chiefly timber. Direct exchange of goods will take place by private arrangements, but the State will control matters by means-of licences.Finland and Austria-Hungary. A Vienna telegram to the Dutch Pi-ess (May, . 29th) states that a peace treaty between An stria- Id ungary and Finland, and two supplementary treaties between both countries, have  been signed at the Foreign. Office. &quot;&quot;&quot;Deported expulsion of Bolshevist Representative. A Stockholm message (May: 28th) states that the Bolshevist representative at Helsingfors, Kerenko, has been, expelled from Finland.MEXICO.Internal Conditions. Air. Cummins reports that in. the course of a rebel attack on a train near Minatitlan on May 29th, a British subject, employed in the refinery,, was killed, ddie General commanding the district has ordered the neighbouring villagers into the town. Mr. Cummins has represented to the Mexican Government the imperative necessity of giving adequate protection to the refinery and employes. The Foreign Office learns that a large German factory in Mexico is secretly manufacturing explosives. ddie Foreign Office is informed that a loan of 10,000,000 dollars has been made by the Germans to Carranza through a bank in Mexico, and that a further very large amount is expected, to be sent, together with supplies of corn, in German ships intended to be chartered by the Mexican Govern-ment from the Argentine.   (See also Report No. 6-1-,)Rupture of Relations between Mexico and Cuba. A press message dated May 23rd from Mexico reports that the recall of the Mexican representative in Cuba (see Report No. 70) is explained in. a statement made by Sehor AguiJar, the Foreign Minister, asdue to the state of war in which Cuba is involved.&quot; .... &quot;This has obliged the Government of. Cuba to dictate a measure which in many cases will affect Mexican interests, on behalf of which the Mexican Legation have made frequent representations to Cuba.&quot; It further announces the definite severance of relations between Mexico and Cuba as the result of a Cabinet meeting held on May 22nd. ddie-Foreign Minister is quoted as saying : &quot; It is an indispensable measure for the high ideals and interests of two nations in the actual moment of the world Crisis. During the present state of war the frequent representations which it was necessary for the Mexican, representative to-make produced tension in the relations between the two nations, which must be cleared up later in order to maintain unbroken the fraternal sentiments of solidarity,., which have always bound us to the people of Cuba and all Latin-American countries. .... By recalling her representative from Cuba, Mexico gives proof of &quot; her con-sideratipn and respect for the. sovereignty of a friendly Government which is now passing through&apos;a critical period, and at the same time furnishes a proof of the confidence of the Mexican Government that its citizens will be treated with all the consideration that the laws of Cuba and her institutions permit under which they will&quot;remain in the Republic under the same conditions as her&quot; own nationals.....   ddiestep taken is in accordance with the conduct of the Mexican Government as proclaimed&apos;
by President Carranza on innumerable occasions, but it may be hoped that the crisis is only a passing one, and that Mexico and Cuba will soon be in a better condition to renew relations on the basis of justice and equality.&quot;The Foreign Minister is reported by Mr. Cummins as further stating that the Mexican lias established a precedent in severing relations to give a belligerent (Cuba) a free hand. Mr. Cummins thinks the step may be attributable merely to stupidity on the part of the Mexican Government, which considers that Cuba has in various small matters been disrespectful; there is, however, a feeling amongst the Allied representatives at Mexico that it intended to demonstrate contempt towards the United States. Lord Reading reports an opinion expressed in Washington that the principal reason is the stoppage of ships for Vera Cruz. Mr. Leech learns that the Mexican Ambassador and the Cuban Minister at Washington are dealing with the cpiestion, and that it is expected that matters will be satisfactorily accommodated.NETHERLANDS.Proposed Vonvoy to Dutch lnJast Indies. With reference to the proposed convoy to the Dutch East Indies mentioned in Report No. 70, Handelsblad of May 28th (ii) quoting an article in the Kolnische Zeitung, which states that the convoy is a measure of protection against the Allies, points out that British Naval theory and practice maintain the right to take convoyed vessels into port for examination. IIandclshlad proceeds to speculate as to the reasons for this abandonment by the Netherlands Government of its previous cautious policy. In a further article of -Line 1st, it presses for a frank reply from the Government: On May 31 st the Nether-lands Government published an official, communique on. the subject, explaining that, &quot;besides the warship ILertog Hendrik,--,imd&apos;er command of Captain De Joncheere; who is Convoy Commandant, the convoy will consist of S.S. Tabanan, transformed (under the rules of the Seventh Convention of the Second Hague Peace Conference) into an auxiliary cruiser, of the Rotterdam Lloyd, under command of Captain Gooszen, and very probably the steamer Noordam, of the Holland-America Line, as a passenger ship, and the S.S. Bengkalis, of the Nederland Company, as collier. The ships will leave the roadstead of Texel about the middle of June, and, avoiding areas declared by belligerents, to be dangerous, will proceed round the Cape of Good Hope. The stock of coal will be replenished, as far as necessary, out of Beughalls, either in neutral ports or at sea outside &quot;territorial waters of belligerents. The duration of the voyage is estimated at about three and a half months. The warships will only carry naval personnel and war supplies, and the merchant ships only Government passengers with their families and Government goods, (Sir W. Townley is further informed that the embarkation of goods, passengers and luggage will be strict!)- supervised, and that private correspondence will not be allowed to be carried.) It is not intended to institute under protection of warships commercial intercourse which without such protection would not be permitted, by the belligerents according to their Auews of the commercial liberty of neutrals. No mails or parcels will be carried. It is obvious that the Convoy Commandant would not tolerate any exami-nation of the convoyed ships. According to usage, he will, on meeting belligerent warshijis, permit perusal of cargo documents hi his custody by the Commander at the latter&apos;s request. In fact, those documents will be communicated to the Powers concerned before departure from Netherlands.&quot;British Trade with Dutch East Indies. The Foreign Office instructs Sir W. Townley that normal, trade relations are now to be renewed between the Dutch East Indies and India and the British Colonies.   (And see Reports Nos. 67, 69 aud 70.)Deported Discovery of Iron Ore in the Dutch East Indies. A telegram appearing in the Dutch newspapers, May 30th, states that iron-ore beds, estimated to contain upwards of a thousand million tons, the exploitation of which would be easy, have been discovered in the Verbeek Mountains, in the Island of Celebes, in the Dutch East Indies.Dutch-Allied Negotiations. The Foreign Office is informed, that the Netherlands Government is not unlikely to make to the Associated Governments an official indication of its attitude regarding a General Agreement (sec Report No. 70).   It is5873-1 ii D
reported that exports to Germany will in any case be negligible except in the case of cattle, which will have to be reduced owing to the conversion of pasture into arable, land.The Allied Requisition of Dutch Ships. Sir W, Townley transmits the arguments of the Netherlands Government regarding the Allied requisition of Dutch tonnage (see Reports Nos. 59-62). These principally object to the employment of the requisitioned ships for military purposes, ft is contended that the action of the Associated Governments was not justified either by the right of angary nor by the general law of sovereignty.German-Dutcli Negotiations. The Foreign Office is informed, that in the economic negotiations now resumed between Germany and Holland (see, Report No. 70), the -Germans are aiming principally at securing credits, maintaining their exchange and creating a position which may prevent them from being unfavourably situated after the war.Reported Assignment of German Ships to Holland. Nieuipe Rotterdamsehe Courani of May 25th states that, according to a telegram from. Rotterdam, two German Steamships will shortly voyage, from the Dutch East Indies to Holland as Belgian relief ships. They have been placed at the disposal of Holland by the German Government to replace two of the six Dutch ships torpedoed in the English Channel on February 22nd, 1917.Pan-German Propaganda. The Ilandelsblad of May 24th writes : &quot; We have learned that preparations are already being made in. Germany for the establishment of a Pan-German news organisation over the entire world, and that one of the first steps in that direction has been the foundation of a National Dutch News Agency in The HaQue.&quot;Smuggling into Germany and Belgiumd Reports have been received, indicating the continued prevalence of smuggling from Holland into germany and Belgium. In spite of the endeavours, of the Netherlands Government to stop the trade in contra-hand, its measures do not as yet ensure a sufficient degree of success. This is due partly to the absence of any central organisation or single control, and partly to the complicity and corruption of certain Dutch officials.NORWAY.Germany and the Norwegiau-American Agreement, The Norwegian Press of. May .31st reports that the S.S. Eihundasund, carrying herring from Bergen to Stockholm, has been seized and taken into Swinemunde. Sir M. Findiay submits that in this and similar cases, formal demand, should be made that the amount so captured should be deducted from that allowed for exportation to Germany under the Agreement. The United States Minister is making the same proposal to the State Department.Norwegian Herring. The Norwegian herring catch amounts this season to 1,600,000 barrels. The fishing interests claim that one-fourth-of this amount.is not subject to the ordinary fish guarantee. Thev propose to- export 300,000 barrels to Germany; 100,000-150,000 barrels to Holland;&apos; 200,000-300,000 barrels to Sweden, ami 20,000 barrels to Denmark.Replacing of Norwegian Tonnage after the War. The Foreign Office instructs Sir M. Findiay that requisitioned Norwegian ships may be replaced on the same terms as those which will be arranged for Holland. The question of replacing time-chartered ships is under consideration.SPAIN.- &apos; German Submarines. Sir A. Hardinge reports that the Commander of U. 56 (see Reports Nos. 69 and 70) is remaining with live men at Santander. Sir -A. Hardinge. has pointed out to the Spanish Government tlie  undesirability of this
arrangement.    His Majesty&apos;s Government has recently again, called the attention&apos; of the Spanish Government to the necessity of taking strict precautions to prevent the escape of interned German submarines, and has also intimated the necessity of making   strong representations   to the German. Government  upon its  continued destruction of shipping in Spanish territorial waters.Internment, of British Seamen. Sir A. Uardinge learns that two British Reserve seamen gunners, who were serving the defensive armament of the torpedoed British S.S. &quot; Heron Bridge&quot; have been interned at Las Pal mas. He has officially requested the reciprocal internment, pending their release, of all German and Austrian Naval Reservists among the crews of enemy ships in Spanish ports.German Propaganda, regarding the Entente and Spanish Shipping. A German Wireless message of May 24th states that Swiss banking circles have revealed a state-men t made from a special source which is in close connection with leading Spanish circles : &quot; ddie pressure of England and the United States on Spain is beginning to make itself felt more and. more strongly. Some time ago the Entente States detained Spanish ships in Entente ports, by not giving them any coals and by refusing them export permits on scanty excuses, in order thus to force Spain to undertake the supply to the American Army in France of fruits, olive-oil, woollen blankets, and other things. After&quot; Spain had met these demands, Spanish ships going to Cuba and Central America and not obtaining a full return cargo there, were forced by the United States to call at New York on their homeward voyage. The American Consuls at Cuba and also in Central America received instructions with that object. Spain is said to have promised to promote by every means her exports to the United States, and in case of necessity even to resort to Government measures. In leading-Spanish circles they are of opinion that it would, be easily possible for Spain, whose neutrality is of the greatest importance to her neighbour France, in view of the hitters miserable military situation, to obtain from the Entente Governments com-plete recognition of Spain&apos;s rights to have unlimited command over Spanish ship space, and that this could bo done by the exploitation in. a perfectly correct way of the political situation as a whole. If the Spanish Government were decided to insist on Spaiibs claims to the &quot;utmost, England and the United States would find themselves forced to give in, -in view of the French and the Continental situation.&quot;German Intrigue i nMoroccQ. Further particulars of German intrigue in Morocco are reported in the Daily Review (N.P.S.) of May 31st at pages 810 and 811. (See also Reports Nos. 63, 64 and 66.)Export Prohibition. A. Royal Decree dated May 31st prohibits the export of spun cotton during the cotton shortage.SWEDEN.Anglo-Swedish. Agreement. It is expected that the Swedish Government will promptly ratify the Anglo-Swedish Agreement (see Report No. 70). His Majesty&apos;s Government has received an assurance that the Swedish Shipowners&apos; Committee will not allow any vessels under its control to lie laid up. ddie Associated Governments have reserved the right to defer executing the Agreement if the tonnage ceded under the Agreement is not put at their disposal without delay. The Swedish Conservative Id-ess has little comment upon the Agreement. Dagblad states that the Right has never opposed an agreement with the Entente with iron ore and tonnage as the basis of the negotiations: &quot; How far the present agreement is satisfactory cannot lie judged until an official statement is published. It is clear, however, that the Government has not heeded the warnings of the Right against putting too much confidence in mere promises, in. spite of its experience of England&apos;s unfulfilled pledges in the modus vivendi. At least, it has avoided coin-promising Swedish commercial neutrality.&quot; ddie Nya Dagligt Allehanda makes a similar criticism, and hopes that the official communique will show that binding guarantees have been received for the return of the Swedish ships after the war. Mr. Branting in Socicd Demokraten considers that the Swedish Government has been able to mark out for itself a safe path between the dangers of pressure drom both belligerent camps. German Wireless of May 31st states that &quot;interesting particulars of the Swcdo-British Agreement are trickling through in spite of the
efforts of officials to keep the contents secret&apos;,&quot; and observes (infer alia) that the Agree-meut is to be exploited by the Entente until a long time after the war, and that the promised grain cannot be fetched to Sweden before the new Swedish crop, tlyit is to say, cannot be fetched at the time when it is most needed. Sir E. Howard learns that much gratification wordd be caused in Swedish business circles if the British import prohibition on wood pulp could be raised as a result of the Agreement.Landsting Elections and Franchise Reforms. In a Memorandum (01.T. 4711). dated May 29th, the Political Intelligence Department sets out the results of the recent elections to the County and Town Councils (Landstingen) and estimates their probable effect on the elections to the First Chamber of the Riksdag next autumn-It- would seem that the Conservative Majority in this Chamber will be reduced from 26 to 20 seats. Jt is noticed that the Conservatives have shown approval of Young-Socialist gains as adversely affecting the strength of %t.he Government block. They have indeed on occasion not disdained to make common cause with the Socialist Extremists, an opportunist policy which plainly in the long jam can bring them no-permanent political advantage. The Memorandum also deals with the question of Swedish Franchise Reform, and observes that the moderate Socialists are determined to break down, by legal means, the opposition of the Right to Woman Suffrage aud the equal communal vote.Oil Imports from Austria. The Swedish Press of May 31st reports that the Swedish. Government has approved, an agreement made between the Swedish Industrial Commission and the A/B Svenska Oceankompaniet for import from Austria of 200 tons of petroleum, 167 tons of lubricating oils, and 110 tons of cylinder oils.. Social Demokraien of June 1st states that, according to the Industrial Commission, the above quantities are only a quarter of the total to be received from Austria, and that the remainder will, arrive in three successive monthly consignments. (See also Report No. 66.)Mines in the Kattegat. The Swedish Bress of May 31st publishes an official communique giving the extent of the minefields in the Kattegat both inside and outside territorial waters, and stating that the Swedish Minister in London has made a protest to His Majesty&apos;s Government and received the right to claim, for any losses in life and property which may result therefrom. Svenska Ilandels Tidning observes that it is all. the more necessary that a protest should be made since previous experience shows that this kind of breach of neutrality on the one part usually calls forth some similar outbreak on the other. Stockholms Dagblad hopes that Social Demokraten&apos;s confidence in. the British Governments willingness to give reparation will prove justified.SWITZERLAND.Federal. Council and Neutrality. A Berne Bress message of May 25th. states : -The Federal Council has published the tenth report on Switzerland&apos;s neutrality-covering the period from May 20th, 1917, to May 1st, 1918. The report states that during this period 91,44-2 refugees from Northern France entered Switzerland, and on April 30th the number of civil and military prisoners interned in Switzerland was 27,220. The report insists on the fact that, with the reserves of cereals at present existing, Switzerland can only feed herself until about the end of July ; and that the immediate importation of. large quantities of cereals is urgently necessary in order to avoid an exceedingly critical situation, although the result of the Swiss crops may be considered very satisfactory. The increase of the area under cereals has, however, now reached the possible limits. The report next mentions the various economic, conventions concluded with foreign countries during the period in question. According to the Convention concluded at the end of December with France, the monthly advances agreed to by Switzerland. were to have amounted to about ten million francs in the event of importations being satisfactory. As, however, the latter were altogether insufficient, the amount of the advances was much less. By the Convention with Great Britain, Switzerland also con-sented to a monthly credit up to the amount of ten million francs, the credit depending- on the quantity of goods destined for Switzerland which arrived in. European ports.   The Convention with France and Italy ensures to these countries.
tlie ridivery of fixed quantities of wood. The report also deals with the Convention with the United States, by which the latter engaged to provide Switzerland up to the end of August, with 210,000 tons of cereals. The execution of the Convention from the lir^t encountered great difficulties, which., despite the goodwill of the Govern-ments interested, could not fie surmounted. Up to the end oil April it had only been found&apos;possible to ship 30,000 tons of cereals. The principal difficulty lay in the lack of tonnage. The report deals in detail with the question of the purchase of ships by Switzerland, regarding which, negotiations are in progress. In order to cover the needs of Switzerland, 280,000 tons oil shipping would be necessary yearly. Thanks to the goodwill of the two groups of belligerents, the report says, Switzerland may hope to see this project carried out. Sir II. Rumbold reports that the Federal Council, apparently in the absence of the President and probably on the suggestion of the pro-German Vice-1hesident, Mr. Muller, has suddenly sequestrated, the archives of the Russian Legation, without giving any formal notification to the Russian Charge cPAffaires that he was no longer considered as holding any official status. A communique to the Press states that the Federal Government decided to sequestrate the archives on. the ground that they were claimed by two Russian Missions neither of which had an official character. There is, however, some reason to suppose that this action was taken at the request of the Maximalist Mission. The representations of the British, French, and. Greek Ministers regarding the activities of King Constantino in Switzerland (see Reports Nos. 56, 6-1- and 67) have not yet resulted in any decisive action by the Federal Government, which apparently desires further proof of such activities. A. press correspondent draws attention to the Germanophil discrimination shown by the majority of the German-Swiss newspapers, as shown both in the publication and suppression of war news and in ijolitical propa-gaiithi&apos;; for example, no mention was made in them of the recent- deliberate bombardment of British hospitals behind the lines by German aircraft, reported by Renter on May 24th ; indeed the Neue Znrcher Zeitung on May 25th published a Wolff telegram alleging that bombs had been dropped by Allied airmen on a German hospital.Maximalist Mission. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the Head of the Maximalist Mission in Switzerland (see Report No. 70) has left official, cards upon the Allied Ministers.German-Swiss Agreement. German Wireless of June 3rd reports the ratification of the German-Swiss Economic Agreement.   (See Reports Nos. 69 and 70.)Loan, of Rolling Stock to Germany. According to a reliable report, about 400 Swiss railway trucks have recently- been lent to Germany.Cotton Exports to Germany. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4713) dated. May 31st, are set out the terms of the Agreement, ratified by the Federal Government on May 8th (see Report No. 69), for controlling cotton exports to Germany and preventing the accumulation of stocks from overseas. (See also Reports Nos. 51-53, and under &quot; Germany.&quot;)THE VATICAN.Air Warfare. At the appeal of Cardinal Hartmann, Archbishop of Cologne, the Vatican made representations to His MajestyV Government urging that air raids should not be made against towns behind the lines on May 30th, being the celebration of Corpus Christ!. His Majesty&apos;s Government gave an undertaking to. that effect, which Avas duly observed. Count de Salis has now brought to the notice of the Vatican the facts that British hospitals at Etaples were attacked immediately before the Cardinals appeal, and that Paris was bombarded throughout May 30th and a church hit.5873 lb
ISPEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. Mr. Wardrop on May 20lb. (received 29th) quoted a report from the Moscow Press of Count MirbaclFs note refusing a liiisso-German Commission at Moscow to deal with all economic and financial questions. Count MirbaclLs counter proposal was for a Russo-Geriiian Commission to sit at Berlin in order to find a modus vivendi abont the supplementary Brest Treaty, and another mixed Commission to deal with commerce and with German financial assistance for Russia, to sit at Moscow.On May 30th the Admiralty reported that Commander Piotski was being sent to Berlin as head of a Naval Mission to discuss naval details of the peace terms, and to demand information as to German intentions regarding the Russian fleet. Russian Wireless of May 30th reported a message from M. Chicherin to doffe at Berlin, telling him, in connection with negotiations about the Black Sea Fleet, to insist especially on the necessity for an Agreement affecting all fronts including the Turkish, where it is necessary that the further advance of the Turks should be stopped.On dune 1st M. Joffe sent a message from Berlin to Chicherin stating that no special legal Commission has been projected. The Germans insist upon a financial Commission at Berlin, and an economic Commission at Moscow. ddie financial Commission will decide nothing. After an exchange of-views, the decision will be with the Government. A political Mission to settle the six points raised, originally by M. Chicherin, and a seventh concerning the property belonging to the Russians which was taken by the Germans after March 1st, has been agreed to at Berlin, but Moscow has been positively-refused as a meeting place. The Germans insist upon Berlin. ddiey also insist that the Commission shall meet -without delay. Von Ivuhhnann is proposed as head of the German delegates, and he cannot leave Berlin.Russian Wireless of June 4th publishes a message from M. Chicherin to Joffe at Berlin mentioning a maritime Conference to be held at Reval in response to the invitation of the German Government.According to information supplied by Air. Wardrop on May 23th (received June 5th), Count Mirbach, in reply to a Russian protest against the use of destroyers in the Black Sea, has advised the Russians to appty to the Turks about it.Mr.. Lockhart on May 27th reported, that the Bolshevists were about to make a treaty with Finland under which Russia would give up the western, portion of the Murinan coastal region to Finland, and obtain Raivola and Fort Ino in exchange. He reported further that the Bolshevists were, afraid, either to co-operate with us in the Murman region or to ask us to leave. Russian. Wireless of June 1st contained-a message from Chicherin stating that he had transmitted a note to Count Mirbach agreeing to accept the proposal of the German Government. &quot; This proposal consists in provision for the ceding by Finland to the Russian Republic of the Fort Ino and of Raivola, if the Russian Republic promises not to fortify these places, and in ceding by the Russian Republic to Finland of the western part of Murman with the Outlet to the sea.&quot;In an. important Memorandum (on the Baltic Brovinc.es), dated. May 17th (G.db 4687), the Political Intelligence Department deals with racial and territorial questions affecting the future of Esthonia, Latvia or Lettlaud, and Lithuania, arising out of the Brest-Litovsk Trealy. ddie following quotation is given from the opinion of Professor Voldemar, Lithuanian Attache at Brest-Lilovsk to the Ukrainian. Delegation :--&quot;My conviction is that Russia is gone for ever ; I speak it from knowing the people of Russia from personal observation, ddierefore Britain would do well in helping the new small States around the Baltic Sea which are willing to enter into a confederation with the Scandinavian nations. If Britain would support this project the Swedes would be won, and the small peoples (Lithuanians, Letts, Esthonians, Finns) would be delighted, ddie Northern Union could some way counterbalance the German supremacy. Besides, the Lithuanians are in perfect harmony with Ukrainia, and it would not be difficult to make them join the Northern Union..........   In my opinion such a policy is theonly alternative for Britain if Britain foresees the nearest future in. Eastern Europe, ddie Great Russians will remain in turmoil and anarchy for many years, and none of the nationalities which have been, able to get away from them shall (sic) voluntarily return into their fold ; sooner they will revolt than submit to the domination of the semi-barbaric Russians.&quot;
On -Tune 1st Russian Wireless published a message to Joffe at Berlin on the subject of the Don Provinces. The message states that, in connection with the Russo-Ukrainian peace negotiations, the great Don Government. has addressed to the Ukrainian State a note in which it is said that the South Eastern. Union is not a part of: the Russian. Councils Republic, but a distinct sovereign State, which is at war against the unrecognised Government of tlie Councils Republic. Russian newspapers say that they expect the reply of the Ukraine to the Bon will be a favour-able one, because, if the Ukrainian Government should, deny the legality of the Don Government, it would as a consequence deny its own legality. It is clearly apparent that an agreement exists between the Governments of the Don and. of -Germany. On the same date IVl. Chicherin sent a message to Joffe at Berlin in the following 1erms : &quot; Against invading foreigners the warlike Cossack Don will rise in force. Every advance of Germany towards the East on the basis of allegations as to an exercise of self-determination on the part of the peoples is a contradiction to the promises which were given that they would go no further. It is an attempt to -strangle Russia. We have accepted an economic agreement and modus vivench. Why will they strangle us ? &quot; Russian Wireless of June 1st published a manifesto signed, by Lenin, Trotsky, Chicherin and. Stalin to the Cossacks of the Don and Eu ban declaring that the Don region is an integral part of the Russian Councils Federal Republic.Russian Wireless of June 3rd stated that a note had been addressed to the Turkish Minister at Moscow about the Caucasus, protesting against the action of the Ottoman Government in entering into relations at Constantinople with representatives of the so-called Government of tlie Mountaineers, which does not enjoy the esteem or the confidence of the majority of tlie people of the Northern Caucasus.On May 29th, Lord Reading reported on good authority the terms of a Peace Treaty said to have been signed between Turkey and the &quot; Caucasian Government.&quot; The terms give Turkey military advantages in the use of railways for operations against British troops in the Middle East.Finland. German Wireless of May 80th. published a message from Vienna to the effect that a Peace Treaty, with a supplementary economic and legal-political treaty, had been signed between Finland, and Austria-Hungary on that morning.Air. Wardrop on May 26th (received 29th) reported on the authority of the Moscow Press that AI. Chicherin, in a note to Count Mirbach, has agreed as a basis of the proposed negotiations between.Finland and Russia to cede to Finland the western part of the Murman coast in exchange for Fort Ino and Raivola which Russia -will not fortify.   (See also under General.)According to German. Wireless of June 5th, the Finnish Diet approved the &quot; G er man o-Finnish Peace Treaty &quot;on June 3rd.Germany. The Political. Intelligence Department on May 30th, in a memorandum on the new Austro-German Alliance, as represented for the benefit of German public opinion, laid stress on the following points : (a) That 20-25 years is the period mentioned for the duration of the Treaty ; (b) that the alliance has been arranged to confront the menace of &quot;a whole world of enemies &quot;- produced by the war; (c) that unity of conception and action in military affairs is to be established in peace as well as in Avar ; and (d) that permanent community of interests is to be brought about in the economic sphere (G.T. 4727).In the same memorandum an exposure is made of the German, policy over defeated enemies of economic control, far more deadly than heavy indemnities, and a full exposure is made of the German war aim of adopting a similar policy against ourselves, which they endeavour to camouflage under the specious phrases &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; and &quot; supply of raw materials.&quot;There are various indications oE the purpose of an approaching visit by the Eing of Bavaria to the Emperor Charles. A report from Sir If. Rumbold (May 30th) indicates a hope on the part of the Germans to crush France, and then to approach &quot;Great Britain with peace proposals. He quotes a further rumour that revisions of the Brest Treaty may be made in a form Avhich may tend towards the conclusion of a general peace. (See edso under General for the new negotiations with the Russians at Berlin and Moscow, also under Austria-Hungary.)According to German. Wireless of June 5th, the Federal Council ratified.the Peace Treaty between the Central Powers and Rumania on June 4th.
A-ustria-H.uu.ciary. On June 1st M. JolTe sent a message by: wireless to IT. Ghicherin at Moscow, pressing for ratification, of the Brest Treaty, without, which the Treaty does not come into legal force. Russian citizens, particularly those who are awaiting amnesty, suffer in consequence.   (See below.)On June 2nd, Sir W. Town ley forwarded, information about a proposed visit to Vienna of the King-of Bavaria, adding that during that visit the question of peace conditions, to be pressed for finally by the Central Rowers, would be discussed. The terms of Bavaria&apos;s alleged claims are reported. These comprise the inclusion of Alsace-Lorraine in Bavaria, as a compensation for the personal union, (sic) between Saxony and Lithuania, and for the cpiestion of the future status of the Baltic. Provinces being settled in accordance with Prussian wishes. Bavaria is also said to make certain claims affecting her canal schemes and financial assistance by Austria as a compensation for accepting the Austrian solution of the question of Poland. The attitude in An stria-Hungary favours delay in settlement of these questions, pending the result of the offensive battles in Prance and Flanders. Baron Buriarhs visit to Berlin is connected with this subject.M. Chicherin informed M. Joffe by AVireless on June 5th that the Russians had ratified the Brest Treaty on March 17th, and he had heard, that the &quot;Austro-Hungarian Assemblies &quot; would ratify it &quot; shortly.&quot;   (See above.)Turkey. Mr. Wood house (Moscow) on May 27th drew attention to an article iu the Nooaya Zhija of May 24th, announcing that an apparently innocent note had just been presented by the Turkish Minister at Moscow asking, under the conditions of the Brest Treaty, for the return to Turkey of certain Russian &quot;Moslems to be facilitated. This action is attributed to a proposed plan by Turkey to exterminate the Armenians, and to convert Armenia into a Moslem, region. The Turks are said to want to colonize desolate Armenian districts with Moslems, thus presenting to -Europe a fait accompli.In a memorandum dated May 25th, the Political Intelligence Department examine in. detail tire question of Turkish war aims. There is said, to have been little sign of weakening in these aims during the five months that have elapsed since the opening of the Brest negotiations, and there is not likely to be, because the aims are bound up with the existence of the governing class. The Turkish war aims are described as follows : (i) Independence, both in internal affairs and in external relations ; (ii) territorial integrity ; and (iii) Turkification. Under heading (hi), the strongest note is the rejection of any compromise regarding the non-Turkish nationalities. The grant of autonomy is refused as emphatically as outright concessions of&apos; territory.Bulgaria. M. Chicherin informed M. Joffe by AVireless on June 5th that he-had been told that the Bulgarian National Assembly would ratify the Brest Treatv &quot;shortly.&quot;Great Britain: British Labour Mission to United Stales. A proposal for such a mission having been put before the AAOir Cabinet, it was decided that, if such a mission went, it should go on the same understanding as that on which, the American Labour Mission, visited this country, with the knowledge and goodwill of the Government, while not representing it.
