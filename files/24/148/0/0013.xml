PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Far East.- The Foreign Office learns that the Bolshevists have been railing cotton, rubber, tallow, and cocoanut oil from VJadivostoek to European Russia ; and war material (apparently including guns) to a German-Bolshevist force at Irkutsk. They have now seized the Post and Telegraph Offices at Vladivostock in consequence of the refusal of the employees to submit to their control. The senior officials have been arrested, and letters and telegrams are no longer accepted. The Municipal Authorities and the Zemstvo have protested. The employees of the Volunteer Fleet and of the supply ships have called a strike, and the Bolshevists have arrested the manager and other officials of the former. The personnel of all the Government offices, except the Customs and Treasury, are now contemplating a general strike, to be succeeded by a strike of business firms, shops and their employees. The Bolshevists are apparently anxious to anticipate Japanese intervention by immediate violence. The Naval representatives of the Allied Governments have been authorised to prevent the destruction or further removal of war material. According to a Japanese Press report detachments have already been landed for this purpose. (And see under &quot; Japan.&quot;)Allied Maritime Council. The Foreign Office advises Lord Reading as to the constitution and functions of the Allied Maritime Council.   It consists of : And is to be charged with the general co-ordination, in accordance with circumstances, of the tonnage allocated to the several management of the Allies respectively ; such co-ordination to be based on information, in regard to the import programmes and available tonnage of each, prepared by a permanent organisation in London.Allied Blockade Committee. The Foreign Office instructs His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the Northern Neutral States of the institution in London of an Allied Blockade Committee, including Representatives of Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States. It is proposed to establish advisory Local Joint Trade Committees in neutral capitals. The Contraband Committee, which now includes Allied Representatives, will, continue its functions without alteration, but will refer to the new Committee all large questions of principle.Montenegro. Mr. Grahame transmits a very cordial message from the Montenegrin. Government in regard to the conduct of the British forces in their fight against the common enemy. Gratification is expressed that the Canadian troops include soldiers of Montenegrin origin.And see under &quot; United States.&quot;Great Britainj&quot; Lord Robert Cecil. ( Sir Joseph Maclay.FranceItalyUnited states secretary   -f Signor Crespi. \ Signor Bianchi.The Hon. R. B. Stevens. - Mr. J. A. Salter.FRANCE.Military Service. Lord Bertie reports that after a speech hy the Minority Socialist Pressemane, the Chamber adopted a Bill for the calling up of the 1919 class
by 482 votes to G, amongst the latter being Blanc, Brizon, Baffin, Dngens and Mayeras.   The Senate adopted the Bill without debate.Bolo. Lord Bertie reports the dismissal of Bolo&apos;s appeal.BELGIUM.German designs on Belgium. The Taglische Rundschau of March 23rd quotes an article by Professor Reinke, who advocates the disannexion of the Bishopric of Liege. He observes that the Bishops of Liege until the end.of the 18th century had regarded themselves as German rulers, and only in 1794 was Liege annexed by France. In 1.815 it was added to the Netherlands and thus in 1830 became part of Belgium. Annexation of this territory would therefore be a &quot; desaunexion,&quot; in the sense in. which Monsieur Ribot used the word. Without Liege Germany would, not be able to assist Flanders&apos; in case she should require help, but with Liege as an aerial base Germany could at once proceed to arrange the protection of the whole of Belgium. The town and fortifications of Liege form a valuable defence for the German industrial district east of the Meuse. (Other enemy suggestions with regard to the future of Belgium, appear in tire Allied Press Supplement of the Daily Review of the Foreign Press of March 27th.)ITALY.Enemy Propaganda. In a despatch dated March 14th Sir R. R,odd reports various methods of propaganda by the enemy in Italy. These include leaflets scattered among the Italian soldiers at the front, some announcing the conclusion of peace with the Ukraine and the demobilisation of Russia ; others bearing pictures of Austrian soldiers side by side with Russian or Rumanian troops &quot; in perfect harmony&quot;; others discouraging belief in American, assistance, which, &quot;if it comes at all, can be of no use till 1920 at earliest, and what can you do meanwhile ? &quot; One manifesto describes the peace demonstrations which are said to have taken place lately at Lyons and St. Etienne as a mark of war weariness on. the part of the French workmen, directed against Clemenceau, that &quot;embittered old man who coldly and impassively sends the youth of France to the slaughter-house.&quot; A further notice declares that the recent strikes in Austria took place iu support of purely political demands of the working classes, and not on any grounds of food shortage : the strikes are represented as having lasted only three days because the Government at once acceded to the demands submitted, and the notice concludes by observing that, during the conferences then held, the heads of the popular organisations were easily persuaded that &quot;our beloved Emperor and Government are making every effort to &quot; arrive at a peace as soon as possible, and the war is being continued merely owing to the obstinacy of the Allied Governments.&quot; Apparently wireless messages purporting to come from, eig., a Bolshevist prisoner of war in Austria, arc also being sent to the coastal towns of Italy by a German apparatus, declaring that the Italians are being deceived, and that the military and economic position in. Austria is very stong; and suggesting the adoption or continuance of a pacifist or defeatist policy. Invitations are being conveyed by the Austrians to Italian soldiers to correspond with their relatives who remain in Austrian-occupied territory. The Austrians have, it is alleged, iu the same way extracted from those relations replies, written practically under com-pulsion, and conveying suggestions favourable to enemy interests. Attempts are also being made in South Italy, especially about Taranto, to enrage the people against their British and French Allies, who are represented as having come to stay, and as being now engaged in exploiting the country and strengthening their hold under the pretext of temporary military arrangements. In various parts of the country, moreover, fresh peace propaganda is being carried on by enemy agents, local priests or Socialists ; leaflets are continually inserted under the doors of houses and shops during the night. On March 17th the Government issued the following notice : &quot; The &quot; Minister of the Interior has given instructions to the prefects inviting them to &quot; enquire into the origin of ail reports of an imminent peace, which are absolutely &quot; false, and to take penal proceedings against the authors or. disseminators of these &quot; false rumours, which, there is every reason to believe, are one of the forms of the &quot; usual insidious enemy manoeuvres.&quot;    (And see Peports Nos. 54 and 59.)
PORTUGAL.Now Ministry. In despatches dated March 8th and 9th, Sir L. Carnegie reports the construction of the new Ministry to be as follows: President of the Ministry and Minister   Senbor Sid ink; Paes.&apos; for Foreign Affairs and War.Minister of the Interior        - -   Senbor Henrique Forbes de Bessa.Minister of Justice - -   Dr. Martinho Nobre de Melo.Minister of Finance - Senbor Francisco Xavier Esteves.&apos;Minister of Marine - -   Senbor Jose Carlos da Maia.Minister for Commerce        -.        -   Senbor Manuel Jose Pinto Osorio.Minister for the Colonies - -   Seuhor Joao Tamagnini de Sousa Parbosa.1Minister of Instruction -&apos; -   Senhor Jose Alfredo Mendes de Magal-. &apos; baes.1Minister of Labour - -   Senhor Jose Feliciano da Costa, Junior.&apos;Minister of Agriculture        - -   Senhor Eduarclo Fernandes de Oliviera.Minister of Food   - - -   Senhor Machado Santos.3The crisis involving these changes arose from the refusal of the Unionist Ministers to approve the Presidents proposal that the election of the President should be by universal suffrage and that of Parliament by a restricted one. It is understood that Senhor Paes has now assented to universal suffrage in both cases. (According to a Press report the elections will take place on April 28th.) The situation gives cause for grave apprehensions in view of active Syndicalist and Anarchist propaganda amongst both workmen and soldiers. If the President cannot count on the support of the Army his position must become precarious, as he has no party on which he can rely. The Monarchist organs, in fear of anarchy, are urging him to form a purely military Government. Some Monarchists are even advocating the return to power of Dr. Costa, with whom they believe they might come to a working arrangement. Meanwhile there has been a succession of strikes affecting numerous trades and various municipal concerns; trouble is now threatened by the employes of the State Railways and the Posts and Telegraphs.Neir Legislation, In a despatch dated March 13th Sir L. Carnegie reports the decree of a new electoral law establishing universal .suffrage. The limitation, excluding illiterates (i.e., 70 per cent, of the population) is thus removed, and the right of voting at political and administrative elections is conferred on all male citizens of 21 years who are in the full enjoyment of their political and civil rights and have resided in the country for over six months. Soldiers and sailors receiving pay may not vote, nor any lunatics, uncertified bankrupts, persons under trial or deprived of their rights owing to a legal sentence, nor those who have been condemned as vagrants within a period of five years from the date of sentence. The peasants, especially in the north, are reputed to hold Monarchist sympathies, but it must be remembered that on the one hand the Democrats have since 1910 disposed of such electoral machinery as existed, and, on the other, that the party in power has for many years past been, able to &quot;arrange&quot; elections. Senhor Paes, however, apparently intends that all voting is now to be free. The new Minister of Justice is reputed to be drafting a Bill for completely remodelling the law of separation of Church and State, which has lately been considerably modified by decree. According to one newspaper it is proposed to free religious education in private establishments from all State control, to recognise the religious hierarchy and the right of internal discipline in. the Catholic Church, to restore Church property to its legitimate owners, to re-establish the Portuguese Legation at the Vatican, and to renew friendly relations between, the Portuguese Government and the Holy See.Monarchist Policy. -In the same despatch Sir L. Carnegie reports a meeting held on March 10th at Lisbon by representatives of the Monarchist parties, in order to decide what attitude they should adopt in regard to President Sidonio Paes, and the coming Presidential and Parliamentary elections. It was resolved, in view of instructions from the King, to abstain during the war from putting forth their claims ; and (without signifying their adhesion to a regime of which they could not form part) first, to co-operate with the Government in the execution of the country&apos;s&apos; Occupied same position in previous Ministry.    2 Was Minister for Commerce in previous Ministry. 3 Was Minister of tlie Interior in previous Ministry.   See Reports Nos. 47 and 51.
international engagements ; secondly, to assist the authorities in maintaining order, and in. the solution of social and economic problems; thirdly, to give full liberty of action, to their party at Presidential election ; and fourthly, to support in the legislative elections majorities to uphold a Government of order, reserving to them-selves a certain representation worthy of their prestige. The direction of all election work was placed in the hands of Senhor d&apos;Orue!las.Contraband. Sir L. Carnegie draws attention to the necessity of an effective control over Portuguese imports.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Austria and the German Alliance. The pacifist proposals attributed to Professor Lammasch (see Report No. 6.1) are explained by him, according to the Tagliche Rundschau, of March 23rd, as being directed against the Mittel-Europa scheme, in Ins opinion this scheme would make lasting peace impossible, would perpetuate the alliance between GermanVs enemies, and split Europe into hostile camps. What he aims at is a general union of bowers for securing peace ; this would render all special alliances superfluous and secure peace in Europe more effectually than the system of balance of power. He considers that Austria-Hungary ought publicly to put herself at the head of this movement. The Entente would thus be set at rest regarding the dangers of the Mittel-Europa scheme, and the conclusion of peace would become easier. The newspaper takes this to mean that Lammasch is opposed to the continuance of the alliance between the Central Powers.Instability of Austrian. Government. In a despatch, dated March 7th, Sir H. Rumbold notes the significance of the fact that recently the Court, the Church, and the aristocracy of Austria, have been unable to keep in power the Ministries appointed by them. For instance, the Clannn-Martinic Ministry at Vienna and the Esterhazy Ministry at Budapest both quickly fell and were replaced by nominees of the German Ambassador at Vienna and of the big Austrian and Hungarian banks. The same tiling applies to Count Czernin.. Tlie three ministers for Common Affairs have very little power in comparison with the purely Austrian and purely Hungarian heads of departments. And the reason is that the former are appointed by the Crown, whereas the latter are chosen by the Jews, who control, both the newspapers and the banks and take their orders from. Germany. Thus, when the Common Minister of Finance authorised the publication of the balance sheet of the Austro-Hungarian Bank, the Austrian and Hungarian censors prohibited any analysis of the figures, so that the average reader was unable to notice the fall of the gold cover from 40 or 50 per cent, to 1.&apos; (i per cent, (fair proof of the extent to which Austria has been pillaged by her Allies). Similarly, in the recent strikes, Czernin and Seidler were ojuenly pulling opposite ways. Czernin was all for conciliation, Seidler for stern measures. This internal difficulty must be regarded in conjunction with the continuing problems of finance, food supply, socialism, and. nationalism.Czech-Slovaks and .J ugo-Slavs. In the same despatch he reports as follows in regard to the internal conditions of Austria-Hungary : The Czech-Slovak countries (i.e., Bohemia, Moravia, and those parts of Austrian. Silesia and Hungary which arc inhabited by Czechs and Slovaks) are ripe for revolution, which will break out as soon as the situation on the main front is considered sufficiently favourable, that is, when Germany is no longer able to come to the assistance of Austria-Hungary ; meanwhile they console themselves with the thought that the Imperial Government is obliged to flood Bohemia with German-Austrian and Hungarian troops, wdio otherwise might be used at the front. Notwithstanding these troops and the knowledge of the Austrian. Government, preparations for revolution, continue. Bohemia is the most completely organised; officers and non-commissioned officers have been appointed ; arms and ammunition are ready, and the men all have their rendezvous ; arrangements have also been made for taking over the civil government of the country the moment the existing authority is overthrown. Moravia is not far behind. It is only the Slovak territories that lag behind, being a predominantly rural population. At a great meeting at Prague on January 6th, and twice since, the Czechs have formally repeated their intention to separate entirely from Austria. With regard to the Jugo-Slavs, they are equally anxious for revolution, but less prepared owing to lack of leadership and organisation. Nevertheless, there have been several demonstrations, and in February there was a rising in Herzegovina.   By5481-lb B
necessitating the retention of some 100,000 German-speaking Austrians, or Magyar, troops in the Southern provinces, the Jugo-Slavs also feel that they are doing some-thing for the Entente. As Austria visibly weakens, and becomes more evidently the mere tool of. Germany, the Slovenes have taken courage to join &quot;the -I ugo-Slavs in. the demand for independence, ddie distrust of Italy originally felt by the J ugo-Slavs, and skilfully exploited by the Austrians, is now disappearing under the influence of the Italo-Slav Entente (see Reports Nos. 57 and 61 under &quot; Italy &quot;), and it is possible that this new understanding may soon be translated into action.Popular discontent. ddie despatch also emphasizes the shortage of food and clothing amongst the poor. Under-nutrition has caused a great spread of disease, such as hunger-typhus and. various disorders of the alimentary system, ddie evil, is aggravated by the lack of doctors, medicines and medical appliances. After the recent strike Prague was without lighting, heating or bread for two days. At Vienna 20,000 people lined up one day for meat and there were only 800 lbs. to go round. Great bitterness is expressed against the Germans, the Jews (who continue well fed and clothed)., luxurious aristocrats and influential embusques, and the priests (who enjoy comfort without imparting it) ; while hostile feeling against the English at large has long ago disappeared.Austrian Working Glasses ami the Western Offensive. Discussing the question whether the German successes in France will bring peace, the Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung (March 28th) thinks they might make the Entente more disposed to peace by agree-nient, but says: &quot; No victories can compel, the acceptance of peace by force, even &quot; though the Germans should take Calais and occupy Paris, though. France and &quot; Italy should be forced to capitulate and their continuance of the Avar should be &quot; purposeless and impossible, there always remains England, sheltered in an island, &quot; and America protected by the ocean. They could still continue the war by the sea &quot; blockade of imports, raw materials, and foodstuffs. Victory in the West may bring &quot; peace nearer when German statesmen know how to make use of the military situation &quot; created.   Otherwise, after Hindenburg&apos;s successes we shall lie no nearer peace.&quot;Petrol Supply. ddie Vienna Neuefreie Press of March 23rd reports that on March 15th a Government Committee appointed by the Ministry of Commerce to consider the question of petrol, distribution held its fourth sitting under the presidency of Dr. Freissler. Representatives of the Ministry of Commerce discussed at length the situation regarding petroleum which, in consequence of continued coal shortage in refineries, 61: .18 to 20 per cent, diminution of petroleum production in favour of increased benzine, and of stoppage in supply of crude oil, had not been improved, in spite of peace with Rumania, as far as the immediate future was concerned. It was held to be necessary to curtail greatly the service of petroleum between April 14th and August 31st to any but Government factories and such industries as were dependent upon it for living. During that time practically none would be available for private use, and only very little for street lighting, hospitals, prisoners&apos; camps, &amp;c.Rood Supply. Extracts are given, in. the Times of April 3rd (page 4) from a report prepared for the Bureau of Labour Statistics at Washington, on economic conditions in Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, ddie Foreign Office has received information to the effect that the principal grain depots in Odessa have been destroyed, and that there is no probability of corn being transported to Constantinople (and see Report No. 60).GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Rumoured change in Chancellorship. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, Count Bernstorlf is being recalled from Constantinople to replace Count liei tling as Chancellor.Germany and the present Western Offensive. The Deutsche Zeitung (Pan-German) says: &quot;Away with all petty whining over an agreement and reconciliation with &quot; the fetish of peace after the manner of the Reichstag Majority. Away with the &quot; miserable whimpering of those people who even now would prevent the righteous &quot; German hatred of England and sound German vengeance, ddie cry of victory and &quot; retaliation rages throughout Germany with renewed passion.&quot; And Vorwarts (Majority Socialist) writes.: &quot;German Social Democrats regard it as their duty to &quot; preserve   the   German   nation from  defeat.   The  Western  victory  shows   that
&quot; Germany can win in the West, and that America&apos;s contribution is no counter-&quot; balance for Germ any&apos;s release in the East. The enemy&apos;s desire for war was &quot; stimulated by the hope of imposing- humiliating conditions on Germany which &quot; only give the choice between disgrace and a light to the end.&quot; The Foreign Office learns however, that there is the possibility of a- great reaction in Germany if the present offensive does not result reasonably soon in the occupation of Paris and Calais. Dissatisfaction with the progress made and consternation at, the losses incurred are already being expressed in military and official circles (and see Report No. 01).German, designs in the Fast. The Vossisehe Zeitung of March 28th reports the mission of an Indian Prince named Mahendra Pratap to Afghanistan on behalf of the Kaiser and Sultan. In returning, he was cordially received by the Bolshevists at Petrograd, where, in a public speech, he declared that Free Russia must co-operate with Germany; that public opinion in India was unanimously hostile to England ; that Afghanistan sympathised in its own national interests with the Indian movement, and that it desired a Turco-German victory in order that it might thereby escape the fate of Baluchistan. He also expressed the hope that Persia would become iudepen-deut. ( When Russia and Germany had passed from peace to friendship, Japan would join them, and the three would control the entire East. The Prince is now stated to have handed to the Kaiser an autograph letter from the Amir of Afghanistan ; and to have proceeded to Constantinople with another lor the Sultan. After this he will proceed to Switzerland, where he proposes to establish a head centre of the Indian National Movement. The Foreign Office is informed of a German design for an advance by the Enemy Powers upon India via Rumania, Bessarabia, the Crimea, Kars, Erivan, Persia, Turkestan and Afghanistan. German prisoners from Russia are carrying on propaganda in Persia, Afghanistan and Baluchistan; and Germany is aiming at an understanding with Persia.Germa.ni/ and. Ireland.   Sir W. Townley reports a lecture by Kuno Meyer, in the course of which he declared his belief that the Sinn Feiners would be able, either during or after the war, to obtain far-reaching concessions as to self-government and free economic life. Then Germany must be ready to come to ireland&apos;s assistance economically and culturally as far as may be possible within the frame of the general political situation. He added that Germany was indebted to Ireland for having kept away an army partly in Ireland and partly in England because of the fear of an Irish uprising.Nieder-Barnim By-election.- -The German Wireless Press of March 27th announces that, as the result of the final ballot between the Majority and Minority Socialist candidates for Nieder-Barnim, tlie Majority Socialist Wissel was victorious by 22,132 votes to 69. &quot;The Press declares that this result should teach the enemies of &quot; ( lermany that their speculation upon domestic difficulties are as false as are their &quot; military expectations&quot; (and see Reports Nos. 59 and GO).Miltel-Furopa, The Hamburger&apos; Nachrichten of February 27th contains a long article advocating an independent German-protected region at the mouth of the Danube. The Kolniselie Zeitung of March 6th objects to the Mittel-Europa scheme on economic grounds, and contends th.at Germany&apos;s future lies towards the North and the open sea.Food Supply.--Extracts are given in the Times of April 2nd (page 4) from, a Report prepared for the Bureau of Labour Statistics at Washington on economic conditions in Germany.German, and Austrian Socialist Deserters in Russia. German Wireless of April 2nd contains a protest by the German Foreign Office to the Bolshevist Government regarding the Socialist activities of German and Austrian prisoners in Russia. A demand is made for &quot;the dissolution of the War Prisoners&apos; Committee composed of &quot; these, deserters under the leadership of the Austrian Ebennz, and the arrest of all its &quot; members.&quot;And see under &quot;Peace Discussions.&quot;NETHERLANDS.Dutch. Virus on Allied requisition of Tonnage. The Foreign Office informs Lord  Reading thai  March 21st was fixed by His Majesty&apos;s Government as the
date after which Dutch vessels clearing from Dutch ports would be exempt from requisition. Lord Reading reports the decision of the United States Govern-ment to requisition only such Dutch ships as were in United States continental or colonial territorial waters at the date of the proclamation (March 20th). The Netherlands Government has formally protested against the requisition ; it denies that angary can be applied to a fleet en masse ; and declares that, having regard to the past experiences of Dutch ships in British and American ports, the despatch of further Dutch ships from Netherlands ports to fetch the proffered grain from America would be unjustifiable without full guarantee that these experiences will not be repeated. Eandelshlad of March 27th contains an article written by an authority on International Law vindicating the right of angary. The paper-retracts the expressions &quot;robbery&quot; and &quot;theft&quot; with which it had designated, the action of the Associated Governments. The article says that there can be no question -of this, and that the Netherlands Government should hot have neglected to inform the people sufficiently on.this point, and as to the moderate way in which the Associated Governments have exercised their right. The Socialist paper Ret Voik, in a leader entitled &quot; No Diplomatic Game,&quot; emphasises the reality and growing seriousness of the food shortage in Holland, and declares that the Governments reply to the Allies, unless based on the certainty of concessions, is irresponsible and almost criminal. It suggests that the Government, adopting the Anew that the Associated Governments, though violent, are not breakers of their word, should maintain its protest and bargain that the Dutch shall not be submitted to any fresh violence. If it gets this assurance it will only have to find out if Germany will spare ships out and home.    &quot; This is all that is needed by way of diplomatic negotiation.....the diplomatic game is playing with the misery of the masses.&quot; Sir W. Townley learns that the Foreign Ministers reply to the Allies is strongly criticised by Mr. Troelstra (see Report No. 51)).Netherlands and Germany. Sir W. Townley learns that pending the conclusion of a new economic arrangement between the Netherlands and German Governments ([see Reports Nos. 60 and 61), imports of German coal into Holland have temporarily ceased.Benzine Supply. Sir W. Townley reports that, according to the Dutch Information Bureau for Supplies, the supply of pure benzine is estimated to last for four weeks at the outside. The Netherlands Government has been informed that provisionally there is no question of benzine or benzol, being supplied by the Central Powers.Daylight Saving. Sir W, Townley -reports that summer time has been fixed by Royal Decree to date from April 1st to September 30th.SWITZERLAND.Swiss-British Loan Agreement. Sir II. Rumbold reports the ratification by the Federal Council of the Swiss-British Loan Agreement,   (See Report No. 61.)British Exchange. With reference to the recent large purchases in Switzerland of British notes (see Report No. 60), Sir H. Rumbold reports a statement that these are being made by Austrians who wish to acquire securities which will maintain then-value after the war. He suggests, however, that more probably the notes are being bought by enemy interests for&apos;the purpose of making trouble in Egypt and. India.British and, German Economic Negotiations with Switzerland. Sir II. Rumbold reports that the German Government is now negotiating for- renewal of the German-Swiss economic agreement which terminates at the end of April. It demands (inter alia) that the Treuhandstelle should be given authority equal to that of the S.S.S. ; and that goods manufactured with the aid of German coal should be prohibited for export to the Allies. The supply of coal from Germany will very probably be reduced. There is a shortage in Switzerland of cattle for slaughter purposes, of cheese, and of milk-; and Swiss imports of oilcake are deficient. Sir II. Bum bold suggests certain lines upon which the Allies might, negotiate with the Swiss Government in order to control Swiss exports to Germany, and. ensure the supply to themselves of Swiss milk and wood.NORWAY.Bolshevism. Sir M. Findlay reports a meeting at Christiania of the National Conference of workmen&apos;s Councils, at which resolutions were passed demanding,
inter alia, complete control by the working classes (through the Councils) of industry, fisheries, agriculture, transport and distribution; rationing of food (all rations to be disregarded if potatoes are not rationed by April 6th); abolition of military service, and stoppage of military productions, and an eight hours day (before May 1st) at present wages. Sabotage or a general strike is threatened if the two last demands are refused. According to a Press report the Extremists have now captured the Socialist organisation (and see under &quot; Sweden&quot;).Spitzbergen. The Foreign Office learns that the German Government has claimed either representation or a veto at the Spitsbergen Commission (see Reports Nos, 60 and. 01). Representation by Great -Britain and. France would be encouraged by the Norwegian, and probably by the Swedish Government.Pyrites. The cpiestion of the control, of pyrites is discussed in a Memorandum (E.C.O. 72), dated March 25th, by the Economic Offensive Committee (and see Reports Nos. 57 and 59).SWEDEN.Bolshevism and Germany. In a despatch dated March .15th. Sir E. Howard reports that the apprehensions of a probable Bolshevist movement in Sweden, which last year were felt mainly by the leisured classes, are now shared by persons who have intimate, knowledge of the working classes. A Conservative paper has reported an agreement between M. Hoglund, a well-known Swedish Bolshevist, and Finnish and Russian Bolshevists, that reinforcements should lie sent from. Finland and Russia to support a Bolshevist rising in the spring. M. Hoglund has not contradicted this story, though the Social Demokralen has called on him to do so. Politiken, which represents the extreme Socialists, in a leading article on March 9th, attributes the failure of last years &quot; hunger demonstrations &quot; to lack of organisation, and announces the formation of a Labour Council, consisting of delegates from the various extremist parties, which is to work together with a number of local Labour Councils shortly to be organised. The prospect is held out of mass action, &quot; to show that the working classes no longer intend to be crushed under the terrible conditions now prevailing.&quot; The raanu-facturing town of Orebro appears to be the centre of this agitation. On the other hand, the same paper has recently appealed to the working classes to realise that it is to the interest of Germany to see Sweden, torn by inner dissensions; it has further mentioned the rumoured formation of a Conservative White Guard for the suppression of Bolshevism, and. has suggested that such a plan is very probably mere provocation, with German and Finnish influences behind it. Although it is doubtful whether Germany would think it worth while to foster Bolshevism in Sweden,, it is obviously in her interest to make the upper classes believe that Swedish Bolshevism, is a very real and pressing danger; partly because fear of Bolshevism in the Army and Navy will render Sweden more passive as regards German aggression in the Baltic; partly because a sense that Germany is fighting their battles in combating Bolshevism in Finland has mitigated Swedish irritation at the German occupation of the Aland Islands, just as the refusal of the Swedish Government to com bat it by intervention in Finland has incensed Conservative opinion and weakened the position of the Government; parti)7 again because, if Bolshevism in Finland and Russia can lie made to seem a new &quot;Russian danger,&quot; the Swedes may almost come to welcome a German bulwark between themselves and the zone of infection on the other side of the Baltic. (The Conservative Aftonbladet has, in fact, a signed article, saying that the Swedes may yet be glad that Germany has advanced so far on the opposite Baltic coast, as she will be near at hand if help is needed by Swedes in Sweden.) The influence of such ideas probably explains how, in spite of their genuine alarm regarding Germany and Finland, Swedish Conservatives still tolerate the disingenuousness of their Press in continuing to hold up Germany as a friend and model, while bitterly attacking the Entente. (The Times of April 3rd devotes a column, at page 5, to this subject).   (And see under &quot; Norway.&quot;)Germany and Swedish Negotiations with the Allies. The Swedish pro-German Press continues to express indignation against the Allies and sympathy with Holland in connection with the requisition of Dutch tonnage, it also evinces satisfaction at the reports of German successes in the West, and urges the Government to defer signature of the Agreement with the Allies.   A/lontidning, however, and Mr. Bran ting
in Social Demokraten, recall the nonfulfillment of GermanoruiiJ hopes three years ago, and trust that, for the sake of universal liberty, they will again be., baulked. Meanwhile, in the course of a speech delivered at Mahno on March 31st, Mr.- Ryden,-. the Socialist Minister of Education, has declared that an arrangement with Germany, similar to that concluded by Finland, is being secretly planned by certain, sections of the Swedish opposition, according to which, in consideration of the cession of the Aland Islands and the provision of cereals by Germany, Sweden is to associate herself with the German block. For this purpose it Avill be necessary to overthrow the existing Government, and the idea is to accomplish this by a coup like that of 1914. The first step to this will be to prevent the conclusion of the agreement with the Allies. Sir E. Howard learns that, upon enquiry by the Swedish Government as to whether Germany could supply 50,000 tons of cereals from the Ukraine during the current year, the German Government declared its inability to promise anything. Allel/anda of March 21st, in an article purporting to reproduce German diplomatic opinion, states that the&quot;sale by Sweden of iron ore to England, which does not need it,, would be considered by Germany inconsistent with Swedish asseverations of neutrality. Sir E. Howard reports that it is now improbable that the Swedish Government will sign the draft Agreement without German consent, which will not be given. He-submits the view of himself and the French and Italian. Ministers, that the continued postponement by the Swedish Government of a satisfactory reply makes it desirable-to request a precise and final decision, and. within a given, period of such request to acquaint the Swedish public with the full terms of the Allied proposals.DENMARK.Danish Seamen and U-Boals. A telegram from Berlin (quoted by the Daily Review of the Foreign Press, April 2nd), states: &quot;A resolution passed by 500 &quot; Danish officers of the Mercantile Marine, saying that intercourse with German &quot; seamen must be broken off for a considerable time owing to the deeds committed &quot; by the U-boats against neutral seamen, has evoked an. indignant reply from. German &quot; seamen. An association of German captains and officers of the Mercantile Marine &quot; met at Kiel, and passed a resolution in favour of an indignant protest, declaiming &quot; against the British domination of the sea and Great Britain&apos;s use thereof. The &quot; protest, adds : &apos; We warn all Danes. Yon are one-sided and pro-Entente, and we &quot; &apos; can no longer believe in your neutrality ; neither can this resolution of 500 &quot; &apos; Danish officers hinder us from continuing and carrying on the U-boat war to the &quot; &apos; end. ddie right of the new weapon consists in that, according to its kind and &quot; &apos; special power, it has to serve the sacred right of the defence of the Fatherland.&apos; &quot;FINLAND (and ALAND).    .Fighting in Finland. -The Finnish Press Bureau on March 30th reported the capture of Tammerfors and Toijala by the White Forces. Mr. Wardrop learns that active propaganda is being carried on for reunion, of Karelin, Archangel, and Gloiietz to Finland. According to a Press report, Finnish White Guards and German troops are threatening the Murman Railway towards Kem, with the result that the local Bolshevists and the Anglo-French authorities are combining to protect the line. German Wireless oE April 1st transmits a protest by the German Foreign Office to the Bolshevist Government at Moscow against the alleged continuance of Red reinforcements from Russia to Finland contrary to paragraph 6 of the pe-ace treaty&quot;; it demands their withdrawal, the punishment of the guilty, and the taking of efficient measures to prevent the further overrunning of .1 inland ; failing which the German Government will take the necessary measures to create the conditions provided for in the peace treaty, ddie Bolshevist Government by Wireless of April 2nd denies knowledge and requests particulars.Anti-Ally Manifestations in Wasa. Sir E. HoAvard reports that a British and an American officer, on a mission to Wasa, with passes from General Mannerheim, were insulted and threatened with violence by Finnish Jager officers, without any protest from the Foreign Minister, Mr. Sario (see Reports Nos. 57 and 59), who was present. Hostility against both Russia and the Allies was&quot; openly shown. The Chief of Police, in conversation with the officers, blamed England and America for having caused civil war in Finland by refusal to ship foodstuffs; and observed that Germany, who wras at war with England, was Finlancbs best friend. There are some 2,000 Finnish Jagers serving with the White Army: they have received a thorough training in
Germany, and exercise great influence upon tlie rest of the troops. The Army also -contains many German, officers. The position of General Manne.rhe.iin, as a Russian, is made very difficult owing to the participation of these German elements.Food Supply. Lord Reading reports that the United States Government is authorising the exportation of 2,000 tons of foodstuffs to Finland.Aland. According to Stoehliohns iJagblad the Germans on Aland have refused to treat with a deputation of three Red Guards sent by the Finnish. Red Government to negotiate. Sir IT Howard, learns that on March 27th hardly any Germans remained on the Aland Islands. It is presumed that the troops have gone to tlie Finnish mainland.Bolshevist Protest at Arrests by Germans.  The Bolshevist Government lias pro-tested (hy Wireless of March 30th and April 2nd) against the arrest by the Germans of M. Kamenoff and. of certain. Russian soldiers on the Aland Islands.Arrest by Germans of British, Subjects. The Finnish Charge dAffaires in Stockholm lias informed Sir E. Howard that, on March. 19th his Government requested the German. Government to liberate the British subjects arrested on the Aland Islands (see Report No. 60). The Foreign Office instructs Sir E. Howard to point out to him that such arrest is inconsistent with the German recognition of Finnish independence, and that its permission by Finland would be prejudicial to her -recognition by other Powers.SPAIN.Germany and the New Spanish Cabinet.- Sir A. Hardinge learns that the German Government is much displeased with the newly-constructed Spanish Government, and is likely to make every effort to embarrass and discredit it. A protest has already been lodged and pressed against the financial agreements recently concluded with the Allies (see Report No. 59) as being contrary to neutrality, but the Spanish Government has refused to accept the German contention.Germany and Freedom of the Seas for Spain. German Wireless of April 2nd reports a long disquisition by the Kolnische Zeitung upon Spanish interests in the freedom of the seas, with special reference to Gibraltar. The question is asked whether in this connection Germany agrees to SpaiAs participation in the general peace negotiations, and whether she would, be prepared then to support SpaiAs demands in this respect. The Rheinish Westplidlische Zeitung quotes a statement to the same effect made by Count -Julius Andrassy to the Editor of the Madrid paper Nation. This statement practically invites the King of Spain to call, a general Peace Conference, at which. Spanish claims would receive the support of the Central Powers. The Foreign Office learns that on March 19th a German submarine stopped the Spanish S.S. Montevideo, informing the Captain that she would be sunk unless she returned, to Cadiz, and that before again proceeding to sea she must procure a permit from. the. German Embassy (and see Reports 54-56, under &quot; Spain,&quot; and 58 under &quot; Switzerland &quot;).Pyrites. See under &quot; Norway.&quot;. JAPAN.Question of Intervention in Siberia. Sir C. Greene reports that, while the Japanese Press almost unanimously advocates that Japan should sooner or later intervene in Siberia, there is a division of opinion as to the desirability of immediate action. Pending the determination of the Allies&apos; attitude, especially that of the United States, there is a general expectation that it will ultimately approve such . intervention. The Japanese Premier has declared in Parliament that, should the interests of Japan or the common interests of the Allies require protection, the Government was resolved to act firmly as circumstances might require. In view of possible serious developments, it might become necessary to convene a special session of the House. (See under &quot; Allied Affairs,&quot; and also in Allied Press Supple-ment of the Daily Review of the Foreign Press for March 27 th.)Industrial Mobilisation. Sir C. Greene reports the passing of a Bill for Industrial, Mobilisation.5481-14n

The views of His Majesty&apos;s Government are invited.MEXICO.Mexico. Mr. Cummins reports that the Carranza Government continues to show strong signs of German influence and of antipathy to the Allies.UNITED STATES.Effect of German Offensive on American Opinion. Tlie Foreign Office learns that the present great German offensive on the Western Front has strongly impressed upon American opinion the gravity of the German military menace to the world, and has stimulated the national determination to meet force with force. Lord Reading reports that a delegation from the American. Federation of Labour will shortly visit Great Britain and France in order to explain, the attitude of Labour in the United States towards the war : namely, determination to prosecute it to a successful end, and refusal to confer with enemy rejn-esentatives. It is stated that in view of this projected mission, the visit of Allied Labour representatives to the United States (see Reports Nos. 59 and 60 under &quot; Allied Affairs &quot;) has been postponed. A Press report announces an agreement made on March 30th between representatives of Capital and Labour, binding both masters and men to refrain from strikes and lock-outs, and to submit all disputes to a Government Mediation Board.SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the Iving&apos;s enemies during the period.

[Mr. Wardrop (Moscow) on March 30th sent a precis of reports published in the Official Journal, including a statement that Odessa had been recaptured &quot; by sailors of the Black Sea Fleet after a short, bombardment, and enemy entirely cleared out.&quot; Mr. Wardrop on March 31st reported, a confirmation, of this report.
