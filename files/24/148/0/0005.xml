The eagerness with which the Germans work for economic penetration into countries entering into peace negotiations., referred to in last week&apos;s Appreciation, is now still, more conspicuous. The word &quot;economic&quot; Crops up in manifestoes by nearly all authorities, from the Kaiser downwards. Von ivuhlmauh, EuxlendorlT, the German Ambassador in Vienna, and Count Gzernin, were in Berlin on February 5th, to confer on political and economic questions of interest both to Germany and to Austria-Hungary, and have since left for Brest-Litovsk.Austria-Hungary.

PART II-FOREIGN AND GENERAL,PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Brest-Litovsh. Both at the meeting of the Commission on Territorial Questions on January 31st and at the meeting of the whole Peace Conference on February 4th, the chief subject discussed was the position of the Ukraine, and the attitude of the Bolshevists in claiming federal control over the country, and in withdrawing their recognition of the Ukraine&apos;s right to complete independence. On February 1st Mr. Lindley reported the interruption of telegraphic communication for 24 hours between Brest and Petrograd. The principal delegates of Germany and Austria-Hungary left Brest for&apos; Berlin on February 3rd. German Wireless of February 5th reports their arrival, with von Ludendoi-ff and the German Ambassador in Vienna, for a &quot; discussion regarding the political and economic questions of mutual interest.&quot;Russia. Mr. Lindley reported on January 29th an official announcement in the Petrograd Press that M. Kamenelf, one of the Russian delegates, was leaving Brest for Stockholm, London and Paris for the purpose of acquainting the Governments and peoples of Allied countries of the course of peace negotiations. [According to a later report from the same source (February 1st), M. Kamenetf-would be accompanied by M. Saalkind, on his way to Switzerland to organise a new International Bureau. Lord Bertie learned on February 5th that M. kamenoffs passport had been vise by the French Ambassador at Petrograd., also M. Saalkind&apos;s. Steps have been taken to watch both these delegates while in France, and they will not be allowed to take any action with a view to bringing about either discouragement or disorders.]On. January 29th Mr. Lindley reported that M. Trotsky, in his speech to the third All Russian Congress of Soviets, described the Brest peace negotiations up to date, and said that the future of the Russo-German frontier advocated by German Imperialists would be fatal to Russia, and that although Germany had nominally accepted the principle of no contributions, she had put forward demands which, if Russia accepted them, would cost her probably eight milliard roubles. M. Trotsky-complained of the want of support by the Allies, and said that, although he could give no undertaking that Russia would not conclude a separate peace, or a promise that the peace obtained would be honourable and democratic, he would do all possible to obtain such a peace. From the tone of his speech, M. Trotsky was evidently building his hopes upon a revolution in Germany. At the end of the debate a resolution was passed supporting and approving all statements and steps taken by the Soviet autho-rities,.and directed towards the conclusion of a general democratic peace.Sir W. Townley reported on January 31st, on the authority of the Dussddorfer Nachriclden of January 30th, that in a recent speech before the Congress of Soldiers and Workmen&apos;s Council at Petrograd, Trotsky used the words &quot; Russian delegation will not abandon its demands ; it will conclude no separate peace,&quot;[This misleading . announcement was objected to by M. Trotsky at Brest on January 31st.]The Foreign&apos; Office learned from a reliable report from Petrograd dated February 2nd that M. Trotsky would probably go back in about ten da3rs to Petrograd before having definitely signed any agreement with Germany.On February 5th, Russian Wireless published a &quot; Declaration made by the representatives of the Lettish people,&quot; demanding an unconditional unity and undivided existence of the Lettish nation, and the withdrawal from &quot;bettouia&quot; of German and of Russian forces to enable all inhabitants to express their will freely; and protesting against the statement of the Austro-German delegation at Brest that the population of Lettonia or &quot; its province &quot; Courlancl, or Riga, had expressed a wish to be separated from Russia. The signatories claim to represent 80 per cent, of the population of Lettonia.
Ukraine. -German wireless of February 2nd reported that on January 31st M. Trotsky protested energetically against the delegation of the Chief Had a assuming the position that they would discuss territorial cprestions alone or independently of the Russian Delegation. The Ukraine was a portion of the Federal Republic of Russia. The discussion took place at a meeting of the Commission for adjustment of territorial questions, and was postponed for consideration at the next full meeting of the Conference.German wireless of February 4th describes the Conference at Brest of February 1st. The object was to determine the attitude adopted towards the Ukrainian Central Rada by the Governments participating. In the course of the debate reference was made to the declarations by M. Trotsky during the sittings of January 10th and 14th, in which he recognised Ukrainia as an independent Republic, speaking on behalf of the Government of the National Commissaries, dire question was raised whether the Executive Committee in Kharkoff represented thoroughly the interests of the working classes. German wireless of February 4th does not report the end of the discussion, but the Times of February 5th reports that at the close of the discussion Count Czernin, speaking on behalf of the four Allied Powers, said : &quot; We find ourselves &quot; disposed already to recognise the Ukrainian people&apos;s Republic as an independent, &quot; free, and sovereign State, which is in a position to make independent international &quot; claims.&quot; 1VI. Trotsky replied that he had not altered the conception of the character of the Ukrainian State which he had hitherto held. German Wireless of February 5th confirms the Times report of Count Czerniibs statement, the last words -being rendered &quot;to make its international agreements independently.&quot;Poland. German Wireless of February 2nd reported that&apos;, at a meeting of the Commission for adjustment of territorial questions, M. Trotsky asked whether it was true that von Kuhlmann had sent a letter to the Polish Minister-President, in which he said that he proposed, to ask for the inclusion of representatives of the Polish Ministry in peace negotiations. Von Kuhlmann, in reply, only referred to his former declarations on the recognition by the Russian Delegation of the position of respective -occupied territories as States. Count Czernin added that at the proper time they would warmly- welcome - the sending of a Polish representative, subject to certain conditions.Estiionia.- Sir E. Howard reported, on. January 30th, that representatives of all parties in Esthonia, except the Bolshevists, at meetings on January 12th and 13th, adopted resolutions declaring the independence of Esthonia, and giving details of conditions. Esthonia should send delegates to participate in a peace congress, and. they object to the occupation of the country by German troops. [This, is of interest in conjunction with the &quot;Lettouia&quot; announcement, reported under &quot;Russia.&quot;]; Rumania. Sir G. Barclay forwarded on January 30th a report from the Military Attache at Jassy, pointing to the probability of Rumania shortly making a separate peace.Germany. Sir W. Townley reports on January 29th a statement by Grand Admiral von Tirpitz to a correspondent of the Nieuioe Rollerdamsche, with regard to Belgium, that a military occupation and a U-boat base would be sufficient for Germany.On January 30th Sir W. Townley reported that three German newspapers, the Frankfurter - Zeitung, Norddeul sche Allemeine Zeitung and Koelnische, had published leading articles -warning the Bolshevists against procrastination, and saying &quot; Gorman patience has its limits.&quot; On January 31st he reported an announcement in the Dusseldorfer Nachrichten of January 30th, that Mr. Lloyd George had said in an interview with English business men that, in the event of England&apos;s defeat, or even of a decided victory by Germany, the latter would always be willing to conclude a peace favourable to England. The article contains similarly absurd statements obviously intended as propaganda for the German people.Sir W. Townley reports on February 5th a statement by Professor Delbriick to a correspondent of the Nieuioe Rotterdamsehe that complete restitution of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belgium had always been&apos; his principle, and he strongly disagreed with Count Reventlow&apos;s theory that the Germans must occupy the Flemish coast to prevent England from forcing Holland to her side. In DelbruoLs opinion the Dutch would join England if the Germans were stupid enough to threaten their
independence by occupying Belgium.    Professor Delbrack is also opposed to the &quot;Mattel Europa claim,   tie was uncertain whether their relations with the Ukraine would soon be resumed, and did not know how much Ukrainia was in a position to supply.   Supplies from Plolland will always be welcome in Germany.&quot;Austria. Sir W. Townley reported on January 31st on good information that Count Czernin gave a copy of his speech at Vienna several hours before its publication to a representative of a neutral telegraph agency for transmission to America. His equivocal wording in. the House was probably in order to appease opposition and workmen. He is stated to have sounded Berlin as to granting autonomy to Alsace-Lorraine, but was told that this proposal could not be discussed either during the war or at peace negotiations following. According to a report from Sir W. Townley,. based on the stenographic report published in the Neve Freie Presse of January 26th,. (. the actual words used by Count Czernin about communicating his speech to America were : &quot; At the same hour when I had the honour to address my discourse to you president Wilson was already cognisant of my answer.&quot;Mr. Barclay on January 30th reported that President Wilson did not receive the speech before it was delivered.The Intelligence Bureau expresses the opinion (January 30th) that Count Czernin had to pledge himself in the strongest way against any imperialist or ahnexationist proposals in order to appease discontent in Austria-Hungary.   (G.T. 3499.)[A precis of Count Czernin&apos;s important speech on war aims is given in an Appendix to this Report. He went to Brest directly afterwards and presided over the main Conference on February 1st, when the position of the Ukraine was discussed, lie left with von. Kuhlmann for Berlin on February 3rd and arrived by February 5th.]Turkey. Sir H. Rumbold mentions on January 31st complaints in Turkey against Germany for not helping to turn us out of Balestine, which von Kiihlmann has promised to do in the near future. In connection with peace, discussions von Kuhlmann has also guaranteed that Belgium will not be evacuated unless Palestine and Jerusalem are returned to Turkey.Air. Stevens reports on January 31st that on January 28th an answer was sent by the Provisional Trans-Caucasus Government to Turkish peace proposals, asking for a respite of three weeks for certain negotiations. The Trans-Caucasus Government has also invited delegates from the Ukraine and from the South Eastern Union to go-to Till is on February 1st for a discussion.Bulgaria. According to German Wireless of February 4th the Bulgarian Prime Minister has arrived at Brest.France. Lord Bertie reports on January 30th that M. Thomas, writing in the Matin, urged the French Government to take advantage of the presence of Allied representatives in Paris to persuade them to agree to a proposed joint Allied declaration of peace conditions.Italy. It is understood by the Intelligence Bureati (G.T. 3524) that Signer Orlando will deliver a speech on war aims at Milan on his return from Paris (1st February 1918). On January 25th they reported that Italian opinion was unanimous in holding that Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilsoifs references to-Italian aspirations were too vague and. restricted, and that Italy&apos;s essential claims-required clear re-statement by the Italian Government.Italy (Vatican). Mr. Gaisford refers with reserve on February 4th to the Pope&apos;s-pleasure at the acceptance by President Wilson, and by Mr. Lloyd George of his principles published last August, and reports his disappointment with the attitude of Germany and Austria. The Pope is said to make a distinction between the German and the Austrian announcements, and suggests that America and Great Britain should endeavour to detach Austria from her Allies. It is said that the Pope a night assist in such action ; he has confidence in the influence of peoples speaking the-N    English language on the future prospects of the Catholic Church.Serbia,. The Foreign Office on January 21st informed Sir C. des Graz that. President Wilson referred in his speech to Serbia&apos;s access to the sea, and that Mr. Lloyd George claimed full reparation for Serbia.
Unked Stales. Sir C. Spring Rice reported on December 28th that the feeling of the United States Government and people agrees with Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s expression that achievement of the purpose for which the Allies are fighting is essential to the future freedom and peace of mankind. On January 4th he reported a private conversation, in wdiich President Wilson mentioned that a Bolshevist agitation was proceeding in the United States; if the appeal was allowed to remain unanswered, the effect would he great, and. would increase. The main point was this, that the war should not be waged for purposes of aggression, and brought to an end, but not on a basis of conquest. The proper basis was the satisfaction, of the legitimate desires of the separate peoples who had a right to satisfy those desires. There is considerable fear in the United States that, should the Allies agree upon a common statement of war aims and claims, the effect in Germany and Russia would be such as to create the impression that the Allies were prosecuting the war for conquest. Sir G. Spring Rice reports on the same date that the American Press lays stress on the necessity of the Allies bearing in mind the unaggressive and unselfish objects on which President Wilson has so often insisted, if they are to light cordially side by side with America.Siueden. Sir E. Howard reported, on February 1st, an interview with Baron Adelsward, in which the latter enquired whether we should object to a Neutral Conference to discuss the terms of a permanent peace. After some conversation, Sir E. Howard put forward the &quot;suggestion that the Neutral Governments, before talcing such action, should consult the Governments of the Entente Alliance, and let them have a plain statement of the proposed questions to be discussed.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Far East,.--Mv. Lindley learns that the arrival of H.M.S. Suffolk has had a favourable effect upon the Vladivostock Press and Soviet, by whom her presence is regarded as a moral control upon the Japanese. Sir C. Spring Rice in a despatch dated December 2iJth, reports a Japanese view that recourse would only be had to intervention if German encroachments eastward clearly menaced, the safety of Japan. Apart from her engagements to the Allies, Japan was too deeply imbued both with the ancient principles of Bushido and the modern spirit of democracy to sympathise with the German military spirit. She exj^ected the free nations to accept her, on a basis of mutual respect, confidence and equalit3r, as their outpost on the Western Pacific.Bolshevist Gonsul-General for New York. -Mr. Linclkrf reports that the Bolshevist Commissary for Foreign Affairs has appointed as Russian Consul-General at New York an American citizen, now in Petrograd, named John Reed, against whom a warrant is out in the United States.Bolshevist Emissaries. Mr. Lindiey reports that two Bolshevist emissaries named Kameneff and Saalkind are proceeding to Switzerland via England and France. The former proposes to expound the Brest negotiations, the latter to organise an International Bureau. Lord Bertie intimates that the French Government will not permit any Bolshevist emissary to indulge in pacifist or revolutionary propaganda.French Ambassador to Switzerland. Lord Bertie learns that M. Dutasta is to be appointed Ambassador at Berne.FRANCE.Resignation of the Under Secretary for Sante. Lord Bertie announces the resignation on February 1st of the Under Secretary ol Sante, a majority in the Chamber having decided to discuss immediately an interpellation regarding bogus military doctors which M. Goclart wished to have adjourned. He is replaced by M. Mourier, a Radical Socialist Deputy who was Under Secretary for War (Effectives) in the Painleve Administration.4985-16
GBELGIUM.War Spirit. In a, despatch dated January 15th, Sir E. Villiers reports that according to&apos; a reliable Belgian opinion, the rumours current in Holland of a strong pacifist movement in Belgium are absolutely false. The newspapers under German control are full of calls for peace. The activists, too, are carrying on a peace campaign, but in doing so they are the instruments of Germany, and no one is deceived. Some feeble, irresolute spirits who dare not face the future, and regret the fleslipots of Egypt, sigh timidly after peace and the abundance of bygone days. But the great majority await with patience and confidence the course of events.Flemish. Movement. On the other hand, Sir F. Villiers reports that there is , evidence to show that the Flemish question is serving to excite disaffection in the Army. Additional gravity attaches to this matter owing to the great majority of Flemish among the civilian refugees and among the troops-this .amounts in the Army to between 70 and 80 per cent. The explanation is that the Walloon provinces were first occupied by the Germans, so that in the Flemish districts there was more opportunity for escape. In ordinary. conditions the population is about equally divided. The pan-German point of view appears from an interview given by Admiral Tirpitz to the Berlin correspondent of the Nieiiwe Hotter damsche (Jourant, in which the Admiral declares for a policy of liberating the Flemish people from suppression, by French elements and preventing the use of Flanders as an English glacis on the continent, from which robber expeditions could be made against Germany. &quot; Antwerp will remain as it is.&quot; Professor Delbriick, however, interviewed by the same paper, declares that the Butch would join the English if the Germans were stupid enough to threaten their independence by occupying Belgium.ITALY.War Alms. The Intelligence Bureau points out that unless Signor Orlando in his forthcoming speech on -war aims can satisfy the Democrats and Moderate Liberals that no further curtailment of Italy&apos;s claims is envisaged than that which they themselves have demanded, results will probably follow which would seriously imperil the permanent solidarity of Italy with the Allied Bowers. If their sympathies are alienated it is quite likely that they may be driven into the arms of Giolitti, wdio already has the support both of the Clericals and the Official Socialists, and could very possibly obtain the support of the Nationalist intellectuals. Giolitti would, in the general peace negotiations, throw his weight on the side of the Central Empires and afterwards come into power with a policy framed on lines believed to be favoured by Caillaux and himself.llalo-Slav Entente. The Intelligence Bureau cites various examples of Italian benevolence towards self-determination in the Dual Monarchy, as exemplifying the movement towards an Italo-Slav Entente.Subversive Propaganda.- Subversive propaganda is reported by the Intelligence Bureau as again very active, especially among the second line troops and in the smaller country towns. There is evidence that many French soldiers are associated with the revolutionary movement at the Front ; while among the extreme Socialists menacing developments are taking place as a reply to the increased activity and better organisation of the war party. &quot; Bed Legions &quot; on the Bolshevik model are being enrolled both from, urban and agrarian classes, which are intended to act separately in safeguarding the economic interests of the two classes, but to unite for national and international political purposes.PORTUGAL.He cognition. Sir L. Carnegie reports a statement in the Portuguese Press that the President intends to regularise his position by taking a plebiscite.   The Portuguese
ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS&quot;.Austrian Situation. The Intelligence Bureau believes that repression in Germany is likely to react upon Austria-Hungary, where such a policy is out of the question. While the more radical wing of the workmen is suspicious of the good faith of the Government, there is also great indignation among the German bourgeois parties, especially the Christian Socialists of Vienna, at the pledges given ; for the introduction of universal suffrage in the municipalities would mean the storming of their strong-hold and the acquisition of hundreds, if not thousands, of the petty administrative posts throughout the capital by Socialist candidates. In adopting a stiff anti-Slav -attitude in Parliament after the strikes the Premier was prohably playing up to this feeling of fronde.The food question, continues acute. Although it is less than five months since the harvest, and. although Austria-Hungary recently captured the Italian Army&apos;s food, supply for six months, it is yet found necessary to halve the flour ration throughout Austria. The Foreign Office learns that during the recent strike in Vienna, Germany sent 4,000 tons of wheat to Austria. The political position almost certainly precludes a requisition from Hungary.Accession of Russian Troops.  Vomoarts reports that 17,000 Russians with their horses and carts have crossed from Rumania into the Austrian lines.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.The Strikes. The Swedish Social Demokraten on February 1st published a &quot;translation of a broadsheet issued on January 10th by a German Independent Socialist member of the Reichstag. This document declares that if a peace based upon force is thrust upon the Russian people, it will be a disaster not only for them, hut for the Germans; it will postpone general peace and leave lasting enmity, between the peoples, resulting in wars of revenge, competition of armaments, and increased reaction in Germany. It condemns the muzzling of the supporters of a democratic peace and the militarisation of factories, while the pan-Gerrrians enjoy boundless liberty for the propagation of annexationist aims, and calls for a strong expression of opinion from the German working classes. Following upon the dissemination of similar leaflets, strikes broke out at the end of January both in. Berlin and the proviuces. The Kiel, Hamburg and Danzig shipyards followed suit, and disturbances in the Magdeburg district, at Breslau, Essen, Nuremberg, and other important centres are also reported to have taken place. Crows of submarines at Kiel and Hamburg have refused to go to sea and acted in combination with the strikers. In Berlin a General Strike Committee was elected consisting of ten men and one woman. This Committee was joined by Haase, Ledebour, and Dittmanu, representing the Socialist Minority and also by Scheidemann, Ebert, and Braun, representing the Majority. A. deputation of five workmen and four Deputies requested an interview with the Prussian Minister of the Interior, Waltraff, who declined to receive the workmen, but said he would deal with the Deputies. The Executive Committee refused this suggestion. Military measures were  adopted  in Berlin. Hamburg, Bremen, and  elsewhere,  and  strikers wereForeign Office anticipates the formal and official recognition by Spain of the President and his Government.Goal for Lisbon. The Foreign Office advises Sir L. Carnegie that transport has -been arranged for a cargo of coal for the purposes of the gas and electricity supply in Lisbon.   (See Report No. 51.)Coal for Madeira Sugar Factories. The Foreign Office has instructed His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul at Madeira to take steps to remedy the situation mentioned in Report No. 53.
threatened with military, service. In the Ruhr district there were sanguinary encounters between troops and strikers, but soldiers refused to use machine guns against the crowd. In Frankfurt many editors of Bourgeois newspapers agitated in favour of the strikers. The Central Commission of the Berlin Trades Unions adopted au attitude of neutrality towards&apos; the strikes, which it professed to consider as of a purely political character. The German Wireless Press of February 5th reports that. &quot; the partial strikes which broke out in Berlin and other German towns have ended.&quot; Simultaneously it announces that herr Dittmann, an Independent Socialist Democrat,, has been sentenced by Extraordinary Court-martial to five years&apos; confinement in a fortress for treason and to two months&apos; imprisonment for resisting the State authorities. According to Press reports,his offence consisted of an attempt to address, a strike meeting. From the fact that the German Government has permitted the publi-cation of certain particulars of the strikes and comments suggesting their imitation by Allied labour, it cannot, safely be argued that they were engineered expressly with that object. In all probability the movement was spontaneous, arising primarily from the recent reduction in the food ration, but aiming no doubt at political enfranchise-merit and peace. It would, however, appear that the Government connived at the assumption of control by the Socialist leaders. The Bavarian Minister President publicly thanked the Soch^i&apos;.D.erhccrats for &quot;leading the movement into peaceable channels,&quot; and it is probable that the authorities forced Scheidemann upon the: Labour Committee. As Ger mania points out, the supreme question is whether the alliance between Scheidemann and Haa.se will be maintained, and if so, at the expense of whom and what. According to the latest information, Scheidemann ami the Majority Socialists wall not break with the Reichstag Majority, though it is believed that they have been given far-reaching assurances with regard, to the policy of the Government. VorwdHs of February 2nd declares : &quot;Now that this effort has failed no reproach can be levelled against us for standing by the workers, our comrades &quot; and brothers at such a moment. . . . We declare emphatically that we belong to &quot; the workmen, and will continue to belong to them in whatever troubled times, &quot; may come.&quot; According to the Lohalanzeiger of the same date the Social Democratic leaders are demanding the instant summoning of the Reichstag.The Information Bureau, in a report dated January .16th gives the following impressions of the German situation as noticed hy a recent visitor : -The Kaiser. The Kaisebs belief in the divine origin of the Prussian Monarchy is still unshaken, and it is unlikely that he will make further concessions than those already offered in the Prussian Franchise Bill, which already enrages the Conservatives without satisfying the Progressives. With regard to international policy he is believed to hold the middle line between the annexationists and the Reichstag Majority and to be a supporter of schemes which tend towards economic influence rather than what the Military party call, an &quot; adjustment of frontiers.&quot; He-is a strong partisan of a &quot; Middle Europe &quot; policy based on this principle. While-Hindenburg and Ludendorff are inspired by Admiral Tirpitz, the Kaiser pays-considerable attention to the more moderate counsels of Dr. Helfferich.The Grown Prince. The Crown Prince is merely an echo of the Militarists,, though he is said to be jealous of Ludendorff.The People. The rational portion of the German people realise that the end of the war can only be reached by the people getting hold of the Reichstag, and thus-influencing its decisions.   The relations  between Majority and Minority Socialists are becoming less strained, and co-operation is already being considered.    While the Tirpitz propagandists argue the inopportunity of peace, the Socialists point to-its impossibility in  present  conditions American intervention,   the  comparative failure of the submarine campaign, and the doubtful issue of the Brest negotiations.. Explosions have already taken place in important factories ; and there is undoubtedly the nucleus of an organised revolutionary movement at the front, though it would be-rash to count upon its efficiency, and its failure would be the worst thing that can happen.   Food conditions in Berlin have improved, and the traces of trade with Russia are already noticeable.   On the other hand, the state of clothing and footwear-is desperate.Machinery. The greatest apprehension in German industrial-circles at present is the lack of machineiy.   It is absolutely impossible to get the used-up plant renewed,.
and what is still worse, any particle :of machinery that is still in working order may at any moment and without notice be requisitioned for the purposes of munition work. Any sort of industry not connected with the production of ammunition is completely neglected.Transpqrtation. Travelling accommodation resembles that of 50 years ago, the carriages being worn out, the metals allowing only of slow progress, and the stores at the coaling stations insufficiently supplied.Trade. Since there is at present little or nothing to trade with numerous companies are being promoted for operations after the war. Nearly all these enter-prises, floated by big banking concerns, aim at usurping business in those countries which are supposed to be going to join the Middle Europe concern. Thus, the paper currency, considered at least as doubtful by the Germans, goes to Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland, Austria, and Hungary, to buy real estate there and to pave the way for unscrupulous exploitation. The favourite trick is to increase the share capital of limited companies abroad and thus to acquire a controlling interest. The shipping companies, banks, insurance companies, and big industrial concerns of the Allied countries are thus being Germanised. It is a real j^S^^., of which no peace treaty wall be able to deprive the Germans. The present hatred of America is due less to fear of her military efficiency than to the fact that Russia and China, the exploitation vof which is about the only real aim still studied by German politicians, constitute the future held of American enterprise.War Aims. Sir H. Rumbold learns that Professors Jaffe and Foerster, during their recent visit to Switzerland, were greatly impressed by what they heard of American determination to press the war to a successful conclusion. They have, therefore, determined to endeavour to persuade the German Government to offer reasonable terms, and have now founded a party which will base its programme on the fourteen theses of President Wilson ; and they report that they have secured the support of Harden and of the Frankfurter Zeitung.Federal Princes and the Kaiser. The Berliner Tageblatt of February 1st reports a speech of the Minister President of Bavaria, from which it appears that proposals were made for a meeting between the Federal Princes and the Kaiser, which the latter emphatically rejected.Trade with Russia. The Foreign Office learns that arrangements have been made for the interchange of necessaries between Germany and Russia, under which the former would obtain rubber, platinum, nickel and leather, and the latter various medicines. The Ukraine Rada has declared a Government monopoly of all imports and exports, and of oil, grain, leather, iron, &amp;c, also control of banks and socialisation of land and forests : these measures are designed to paralyse Allied attempts to prevent goods reaching Germany. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Moscow reports that German commercial travellers are selling freely in Moscow for early delivery, generally accepting one-third of the purchase money with the order, and - leaving one-third for payment on delivery, and the remaining third on credit up to two years. The Germans are also buying up industrial oils, tallow, and other raw materials for early delivery. It is probable that they will instigate acts of violence with the object of discrediting the Russians in British eyes in order to hamper political and commercial intercourse. The fact that the rouble still yields some sort of price abroad is universally believed to be due to the fact that the Germans are buying in London and Paris through Amsterdam, chiefly with a view to the purchase of foodstuffs and raw materials in Russia and to the acquisition of Russian factories.NETHERLANDS.Projected Strike. On February 1st Sir W. Townley reported that a big strike, to be followed by a demonstration, was intended to take place on Monday, February 4th, with the object of protesting against the exportation of Dutch products and 40S5-it, C
demanding the requisition and equal distribution of food stocks. He now reports that though strikes were in fact organised, the more moderate Socialist groups exercised their influence to dissuade the workmen from coming out and that the movement is announced to have been to all intents and purposes a failure.SWITZERLAND.Industrial Unrest. Sir IT. Rumbold reports -a recrudescence of the troubles (of which mention was made in Report No. 43) caused by the autocratic attitude of the&apos; military authorities. There have been numerous violent protests by tracle^irnscTings at Zurich against the proposed industrial conscription of deserters and conscientious objectors. The workmen threaten that, unless the project is withdrawn, the Army very considerably demobilised, and the emergency powers of the Federal Council annulled, they will proclaim a general strike throughout the country, expel the present Federal Council, and proceed to a fresh election. The situation is aggravated by the fact that Zuiach is full of foreigners, and that several depots of arms have been discovered there.NORWAY.Spies. The Intelligence Bureau quotes extracts from a document published by the Morgenblad of December 16th, 1917, entitled &quot;Aims and Methods of the German Intelligence Setwice in Scandinavia,&quot; and notes that this exposure, following upon the activities of Baron von Rautenfels, has profoundly impressed Norwegians. A strengthening of the law in regard to the use of Norway as a spy centre has been submitted to the Storthing.Arrangement with America. The Intelligence Bureau reports the apparent conclusion of an arrangement between the United States War Trade Board and. the Norwegian Commissioner, Dr. Nansen, whereby America will release 500,000 tons of supplies for Norway, on condition that no foodstuffs be exported from Norway except 48,000 tons of fish-produce per year.Shipbuilding. The Intelligence Bureau records the success of the 500-ton &quot; concrete &quot; vessel Namsenfiord, built at Moss on the &quot; Fougener &quot; system, which dispenses with the high-priced labour of the steel worker and riveter. The vessel has navigated the North Sea and accomplished a journey of 2,000 miles.Industries. The Intelligence Bureau notes a great increase in the production of molybdenum, zinc-white and electrodes ; also au invention for making margarine from fish-oils.SWEDEN.Mr. -B ranting. -The Intelligence Bureau notes with satisfaction the continuance of cordial relations between Air. Branting and his late colleagues, and considers he will exercise his great influence in their support. It observes that the existence in Sweden of a Liberal-Socialist rather than a Conservative Government has been a matter of congratulation for the Entente.Bolshevism. -The Conservative and Liberal Press are reported by the Intelligence Bureau as showing considerable alarm at the proposal of the Bolshevists to advance large sums of money in support of extreme Socialist parties in foreign countries. The more respectable Swedish Socialists also condemn such a policy, which finds adherents, however, among the Young Socialist party.
Allies and Propaganda. Sir E. Howard reports that considerable prominence is :given in the Swedish Press to a telegram from Petrograd purporting to reproduce a telegram sent by the Russian Minister on duly 17th, 1917, to the former Russian Government. According to this alleged telegram the financial &quot;support of the Stockholm Telegram Bureau was made the subject of discussions by the Allied Ministers.. The British and American Ministers refused to countenance such action, and in the result a proposal by the French Minister to subsidise the trade unions was supported by the Russian and Italian Ministers. The French Minister in a communique to the papers observes that it is hardly necessary to say that he has never intervened in any way in Swedish internal, politics, though in a report to his Government he expressed surprise that the Allies had never contemplated supporting their cause before public opinion in Sweden by the use of propaganda methods similar to those employed so successfully by the enemy in Sweden and elsewhere. The Press is demanding further -explanations. The French Minister on behalf of the Allies is informing the Swedish Foreign Office that the Russian MinisteFs telegram, winch is incorrectly reported, referred to an exchange of views as to the most effective methods of combating German propaganda in Sweden ; these methods will be enumerated ; and it will be mentioned that no protest against them has hitherto been made in Sweden. [According to the text of the Russian MinisteFs alleged telegram, the Russian and Italian Ministers supported the proposal of the French Minister in the expectation of increasing pro-German agitation in connection with severer rationing of neutrals by America.]Aaland.--Six E. Howard, reports that the Actiyitist Press continues to press for Swedish occupation of the Aaland Islands. In an interview with the Politikeu, the Bolshevist Commissary, M. Vorowski, declared that the decision should rest with, the islanders themselves, but that since the matter has once been do3alt wdth internationally, it is now unlikely to be arranged by the Baltic Powers alone. The Finnish claim to the Aaland&apos; Islands recently mentioned by the Intelligence Bureau (see Report No. 53 under Finland), is the subject of a further statement by the Delegate to the Bureau. He observes that though a great majority of the Aaland mainland have asked to be united to Sweden, there are hundreds of small islands between the Aaland and Finnish mainlands whose language is mixed, and the majority of whose population will tend to become increasingly Finnish speaking. This fact, and the fact that there is in Northern. Sweden a purely Finnish-speaking population should be borne in mind if the Swedes insist on self-determination for the inhabitants of the Aaland&apos; mainland. Sir E. Howard reports a Press announcement on February 1st that the Russian troops have withdrawn from Aaland.Export of Carbide. The Foreign Office has informed Mr. Barclay that under the modus vivendi recently signed His Majesty&apos;s Government proposes to claim that Sweden shall export no carbide for three months from the date of arrival of illuminating oil, for which it is a substitute. Mr. Barclay has requested the United States Government to represent to the Swedish Government that the kerosine sent as part of the Christmas cargo should be included, under this condition. This the War Trade Board feels unable to do, but has suggested sending a further 500 tons as part of the amount allowed under the modus vivendi to which the condition would -automatically attach.And see under &quot;Shipping Situation.&quot;DENMARK.Danish Socialists and Germany.-The Intelligence Bureau details the transactions of the Danish Socialist Party with its German controllers (see Report No. 50), and observes that Dr. Helphand, alias Pawns, is in fact the Superintendent of the Danish branch of the German Imperial Socialists, of which Dr. Scheidemann is the head. It is satisfactory to note that his activities have attracted the attention of the Danish. Press. The Kjdbenhavn goes so far as to state that the separate peace brought about by the Bolshevists was the result of the work of Borgbjerg, editor of the Social Democrat and head of the Danish Socialists, and with their assistants Helphand,.
Sklatz, Fihstenburg, alias Ganecki of Warsaw, now a- member of the Bolshevist Committee in Stockholm,, and Kolowski, who is at present Chief Justice of the Bolshevist Tribunal ar. Petrograd. It adds that the whole movement was organised and directed by Scheidemann.See also under &quot; Shipping Situation.&quot;FINLAND.Revolution. The Foreign Office learns that the Bed Guard has thrown out and. abolished the Senate and has established full control over Helsingfors. The new Supreme Authority has assumed the name of &quot; Finland&apos;s Council of the Peoples-Plenipotentiaries,&quot; , and as such has sent (according to Russian Wireless Press) a revolutionary greeting to the Bolshevist Government of Russia. The President is Mr. Kullerwo Maner, and the Foreign Commissary, Mr. Irtue Sirola ; the latter has requested recognition by Bis majesty&apos;s Government of the Revolutionary Admmistra-tion. According to the Russian Official Press the new Government includes five representatives of the Red Guard. Onder orders from Petrograd, Russian troops and sailors are actively assisting the Revolutionaries. The Russian fleet at Helsingfors has threatened a general massacre of all Bourgeois in the town if any-Swedish troops cross the frontier. German intervention would be welcomed by the majority of the Bourgeois class (both Russian and Allied) in Russia, and still more in Finland. Reports state that a force of the Finnish. Brigade of the German - army is assisting the White forces which are led by General Mannerheim, A further -4,000 .Finns are on their way from Germany to organise the Bourgeois, who have been supplied during the summer with arms and ammunition, by German submarines.. Generally speaking, the Reds occupy the South and the Whites the North. Abo and Tammerfors are both in Red occupation. Detachments of Russian troops are collecting at Tornea. A Swedish gunboat has been sent to take off Scandinavian subjects. The refusal of the Swedish Government to intervene has provoked strong agitation in the Swedish Conservative Press, and anxiety among the propertied classes. A. movement is on foot to form a voluntary corps for the support of the bourgeois interest; The Finnish Delegates to Sweden have announced that Swedish intervention is not desired. Extreme Swedish Socialists declare that both Sweden and Germany have dynastic ambitions in Finland, and suspect that the Bourgeois opposition is partly due to German provocation. The Intelligence Bureau reports a further statement by the Finnish Delegate quoted in Report No. 53. He observes, in connection with the recent coup d&apos;etat, that there is no difference between the Finnish Socialists and Bourgeoisie with regard to the maintenance of Finland&apos;s sovereign independence. The question being whether a Bourgeois or a Social Democratic Republic shall be established, the Social Democrats-have taken advantage of the presence of Russian troops to attack the present Government which is supported by a majority of the Diet. They do not look tipon Russia as their best friends, but as the nearest and most powerful representatives of international Social Democracy. Revolutionary Russia, bureaucratic Germany, and bureaucratic Sweden, have all done Finland harm. On the other hand, whatever political or economic influence, coming from England or Britain, has been exerted there, has always proved a great success.Recognition. Mr. Barclay reports that the United States Foreign Office deprecates full recognition of Finnish independence, holding that the recognition of a number of small States is tantamount to playing into the hands of Germany, who will thus, devour piecemeal what she cannot swallow wholesale.ICELAND.Proposed Modification of 1916 Agreement. The Foreign Office instructs Mr. Barclay to ascertain the views of the United. States Government in regard to a proposed modification of an agreement made in 1916 with Iceland.    Under this.
agreement Great Britain undertook to purchase whatever Icelanders were unable to sell in markets approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, with the resrdt that it was found necessary to accept a large quantity of produce which was not really required. Under the scheme now suggested, after consultation with representatives of the French, Italian and American Embassies, His Majesty&apos;s Government would obtain an option on all Icelandic produce ; and the Icelandic Government would requisition and sell to His Majesty&apos;s Government stocks of wool and fish bought and stored in Iceland, probably for German account. Iceland would be enabled to export to approved destinations the balance not required by the Allies ; and her minimum imports (principally salt, coal, foodstuffs and oil) would be guaranteed.SPAIN.Protest to Germany. Sir A. Hardinge learns that the Spanish Government has made a strong protest to Germany in regard to the torpedoing of the S.S. Giralda.General Situation. The Intelligence Bureau observes that the shortage of food and fuel continues increasingly to preoccupy the Spanish people. The Germans, outwardly the champions of monarchy, the Church, and all established authority, are known to be subsidising Bolshevist newspapers, hiring Socialist writers for- their press, and Socialists and Radicals as their political candidates. This they are doing with the object of paralysing commerce to the detriment of the Allies. In particular --they aim at preventing the signature of further commercial agreements, and the completion of the Allied negotiations for regulation of the exchange. On the other hand, the submarine campaign is beginning to arouse popular impatience against Germany. Even should the machinations of the enemy eventuate in a militarist demonstration (see Report No. 53) or otherwise against Allied interests, it is the Allies who possess the conclusive argument in the power of withholding supplies. Whatever the effect of the shortage of supplies upon the external relations of the country, apprehension is felt of a serious domestic upheaval. There is general sympathy for the sergeants dismissed in connection with the junta movement, and a corresponding current of opinion against the officers. * Republican mayors have been elected at Barcelona and Valencia. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the old parties will secure most of the seats in the coming elections.VATICAN.War Aims of Belligerents. The Foreign Office learns that the Pope is much gratified at the accentuation by Mr. JJoyd George and President Wilson of the principles laid down in his Note of August 1st. There is some reason to suppose that he is less satisiied with the replies of the Central Powers,, though he is thought to discover a more amenable disposition in Austria than in Germany.CHINA.North and South.-Sir J. Jordan reports that on January 30th the President ordered the resumption of hostilities against the South. The Military Governor of Nanking, who forms a connecting link between North and South, has so far declined to take any part. Hostilities are already taking place 25 miles up river from Hankow, and the Consular Body is trying to obtain the consent of both sides to the creation of a neutral zone round the Treaty Port.Tibetan Frontier. Sir J. Jordan reports that Tibetan troops have crossed the Mekong south of Chiamdo, and that there has been a rising of the neighbouring tribes of Sangai.   The Chinese troops upon the frontier are in a critical position.4085 - lb D
Enemy Aliens. Sir J. Jordan reports the formal decision of the Chinese Government to deport all enemy subjects to Australia. The necessary measures will-be taken in consultation with a committee of three members of the Allied Legations.Exports to Russia. Sir J. Jordan reports that the Chinese Government has received a protest from the Bolshevist Government against the prohibition of exports to Russia, and is alarmed at the possibility of reprisals, or even the severance of diplomatic relations. In view of this and of numerous representations urging the relaxation of such restrictions, the Chinese Government has agreed to a resumption of traffic, subject to a system of Consular and railway guarantees both at Harbin and Vladivostock. The Foreign Office has approved his&apos; suggestion that a similar controlled trade should be permitted, in respect of civilian necessities, to both East and West.ARGENTINA.Argentine Republic and Central Powers. According to a Wireless report from Washington the Argentine Government has decided to recall the Argentine Military Attaches from Berlin and Vienna. Popular opinion in the Argentine is stated to have been affected by the torpedoing of the S.S. Ministro Lrriendo. Sir R. Tower intimates his belief that there will be a rupture with Germany and possibly even stronger action.Argentine Republic and, the Falkland Islands. Sir R. Tower reports the publi-cation on January 31st by the Nacion of an undated telegram from its Berlin correspondent, referring to Count Hertling&apos;s suggestion of restoring the-Falkland Islands to the Argentine Republic. The writer quotes observations made in 1916 by Zimmerinann indicating that the restitution of the Falkland Islands might, if the Argentine Republic wished, be included in peace negotiations; and emphasises the historic significance of ..Hertliug&apos;s pronouncement in the light of Germany&apos;s present victorious position.Wheat Purchase. Sir R. Tower reports the full terms of the Wheat Convention (of which short particulars appeared in Report No. 51). The sanction of Congress has been obtained, and credits have been opened at Buenos Ayres. Mr. Barclay learns that efforts are being made by northern neutrals to purchase Argentine-wheat-through the agency of firms in the United States.. He suggests that the representa-tives in London of Scandinavian States should be advised that purchases of Argentine wheat will not be possible unless made through the Allied wheat purchasing-organisation.CHILE.Wheat. Mr. Barclay reports that the United States War Trade Board, learning that there is in Chile an exportable surplus of 400,000 tons of wheat, has ruled that all the requirements of Central America and the West Coast of South America shall be met from this supply. It is believed that after these demands have been satisfied an exportable balance will still be available.VENEZUELA:Censorship. Mr. Beaumont submits that, with a view to obviating delays, arrangements might be made with the United States Government, under which cables between Great Britain and Venezuela, which have been passed by the British Censor, should be absolved from American censorship.
MEXICO.The Oilfields. Mr. Barclay reports that the United States Government does not at present see any necessity for action in regard to the safeguarding of the oilfields, though Carranza has been emphatically warned against adopting any course which would endanger the supply. Pelaez has asked the Oil Companies for financial support ; the United States Government has refused to advise the Mexican Petroleum Company in the matter. From shortage of ammunition, Pelaez does not propose to defend the camps, and Mr. Cummins points out that the oil supply is likely to be hampered, if not stopped, by the resulting guerilla warfare. He suggests that in proportion as the oil is deemed essential, the following alternatives should be adopted: first, to assist Pelaez ; secondly, to buy his consent to abandon the district and give Carranza possession ; thirdly, that American troops should occupy Tampico and the wells and hold them till the end of the war. The JForeigri Office instructs Mr. Barclay to advise the State Department of the position, and to express the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that if the working of the Mexican wells is impeded, the United States Government will see its way to maintain the supply of oil to Great Britain.Pro-German Foreign Secretary. Mr. Cummins reports that Candido Anguila1&apos;, a pro-German, has been re-appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs.Carranza and tlie Kaiser.-According to a Copenhagen telegram, Carranza has congratulated the Kaiser on his birthday &quot; celebrated with just cause for rejoicing,&quot; and expressed his best wishes for the prosperity of his &quot;great and friendly nation.&quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Criticism of War Administration. Mr. Barclay reports that the opinion of Congress and the public has been calmed by the statement made on January 28th by the Secretary for War, the frankness of which is interpreted as an admission of the right of Congress to satisfy itself as to the efficiency of the Administration. Mr. Baker announced that the United States would have half a million men in France early this year and a million and a half available for shipment during the year.Export Licences and the Blockade. The Foreign Office instructs Mr. Barclay to emphasise the difficulties which would arise if export licences were to be granted by the War Trade Board for the export of goods, the passage of which through the blockade could not be approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Pending the establish-ment of an inter-Allied blockade council in London, it is hoped that disputed cases will be discussed between the War Trade Board and the British Embassy.Exports to Russia. With regard to the intention indicated by the United States Government of continuing the export of certain goods to Russia, the Foreign Office instructs Mr. Barclay that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to such shipment in respect of any further stores purchased in the United States out of British credits. The sending of supplies to Russia is considered objectionable, first, in view of the risk of their reaching the enemy ; secondly, because the expenditure appears to result in no compensating advantage ; and, thirdly, because tonnage is allocated which cannot be spared. The forwarding of goods from Murmansk is forbidden by the local authorities ; while to forward the goods already accumulated at Vladivostock would be dangerous if it were not impracticable.And see under &quot; Shipping Situation.&quot;SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau.the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships
lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period January 25th-3 1st,. 1918, inclusive was 58,719 tons gross, of which 32,4-23 were British, as compared with. 67,501 tons gross, of which 46,089 were British, reported, last week..Shillings without Warning. Information received from the Admiralty shows that, of British merchant ships sunk by enemy submarines, with a loss of 8.446 lives,, up to the end of 19.1.7,&apos; over 56 per cent, were sunk without any warning. [G-..T. 3536a.] y- . ,Danish, Tonnage. Sir !&apos;. Paget reports that the Danes still hesitate to put additional tonnage at the disposal of the Allies. The. German Government has informed the Danish Government that it will regard as unneutral any further-surrender of Danish shipping to the Allies, and will retaliate by sinking Danish shipping indiscriminately.Swedish Tonnage. -The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that Sweden has agreed to a modus vivendi, under which, in. return for 1,600 tons of fodderstuffs, .1,500 tons of mineral oil, 25,000 tons of phosphate rock and. certain other supplies, 80,000 tons of Swedish shipping become immediately available for services in the war zone, and a further 20,000 within six weeks of the signing of the agreement. The UnitedxStates obtain for four months the use of the Swedish ships in United States ports, while Swedish ships in European ports will be put at the disposal of the Inter-Allied Executive. Swedish vessels in Swedish ports will resume their&quot; sailings. Swedish vessels in Allied trades&apos; are guaranteed against interference from the Swedish. Government, and the Swedish shipowners are to be free to charter their vessels to the Belgian Relief Commission.United Slates Orders in, Japan. Mr. Barclay reports that the United States War Trade Board has made proposals to Japanese by which shipping would be delivered to the United States in return for steel on the principle of two tons of shipping for one ton of steel. The alternative orders are for 100,000 tons dead-weight shipping for delivery before July 1st or 250,000 tons dead-weight shipping for delivery in equal monthly instalments from April till November. F rom other sources the-Foreign Office learns that still larger contracts are contemplated.Munitions. The Minister of Munitions, in a Memorandum dated January 29th, 1918, illustrates the serious results of cutting the import of munitions, and intimates that the continuance of such, a policy would tend to preclude the probability of a victorious termination of the war.American Orders for Manufactured, Goods. The Minister of Shipping, in a Memorandum, dated January 28th, 1918, points out that the proposal by the American Government to purchase manufactured war stores in Great Britain for the American Army in France should be carefully reviewed from the point of view of tonnage,, inasmuch as the raw materials take up in almost every case more shipping space than would be required if the articles were imported in a manufactured state..Inter-Allied Shipping Committee. Lord Robert Cecil has been deputed, to act with the Shipping Controller upon the Inter-Allied. Council on Tonnage and Imports.United States Goal Position. The Ministry of Shipping reports a great improvement in the bunker position in the United States. It is hoped that this will reduce the delay, which, in some cases has amounted to a fortnight, to ships bringing wheat to-Great Britain.GENERAL.Repatriation of British and Turkish Prisoners. Sir R. Rumbold reports that the-Turkish Legation in Berne has communicated the conditions under which British
and Ottoman prisoners of war are to be exchanged. The German Government requires various particulars of prospective shipments before it can give an under-taking not to attack vessels carrying repatriated prisoners. The port of repatriation will be Scalanova.French and Turkish Civilians. Sir W. Townley learns that the Turkish Government has expressed its readiness to enter into an agreement with the French Government for the exchange of civilian prisoners on the same basis as that already concluded with the British Government.   The port of repatriation will be Scalanova.Invalid Combatant Prisoners. The Foreign Office is proposing to the Swiss, Netherlands and German Governments that all British and German invalid combatant prisoners of war should be sent to Switzerland, and that the space allotted to this category in Holland should be filled xrp with officers and non-commissioned officers who have been interned for over 18 months.Imprisonment of Airmen for Dropping Pamphlets. The Foreign Office has requested the Netherlands Government to notify the German Government that tlie dropping of pamphlets (for which Second Lieutenants Scholtz and Wookey, Royal Flying Corps, are reported to have been sentenced to 10 years&apos; penal servitude) is not regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as contrary to International law or the laws of war, and that similar action has&apos; frequently been taken by German airmen. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore gives notice of reprisals, to begin, failing the release of these two officers, at the expiration of one month from date of reception of such notice.4981 i-lbE
Part IT.Speech by Count Czernin, Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the Foreign Affairs C ommittee of the Austrian Delegation in Vienna on January 25th, 1918, as reported in the G.S. Daily Review of the Foreign Press.Introduction. Count Czernin, in his opening statement, explained that the delays in the Brest-Id to vsk negotiations were due to their special difficulty and to publicity, and appealed to the people to keep calm.No Annexations or Indemnities. In referring to Russia, he used the words, &quot; I declare once again that I (sic) demand not a square metre nor a kreuzer from &quot; Russia. ... If our Russian interrogators ask us to cede territories and pay &quot; indemnities I should continue the war despite the desire for peace, which 1 share as &quot; much as you.....&quot;[No support is here given to German demands for pre-war Russian territory.]Reasons for Delays. Amongst these Count Czernin mentioned the difficulty of negotiating &quot; witli various newly-created Russian States, with Russia as represented &quot; by Petrograd, with the Ukraine, with Finland, and with the Caucasus directly, &quot; and with others who, for the moment, are not represented at Brest-Litovsk.&quot; In a detailed reference to the negotiations with the original Ukrainian delegates, he said, &quot; We &apos;:&apos; have come to an understanding on the basis of no annexations or indemnities, and &quot; we are already agreed to a great extent that commercial relations should be resumed &quot; as they ought to be.&quot;[In this connection it is interesting to note that the Austrian policy to hurry on the establishment of economic relations simultaneously with peace discussions is similar to the German policy see last week&apos;s Western Report. It is also interesting to note M. Trotsky&apos;s assertion at Brest, as reported in German Wireless of February 2nd, that &quot; the Ukraine is a portion of the Federal Republic of Russia,&quot; and later reports that German officers have iDenetrated into the country in motor-cars, and that Odessa is in Bolshevist hands. The disposal of the valuable resources of the Ukraine is apparently still in the balance tod affecting peace negotiations. At the end of his speech Count Czernin again emphasised the importance of getting foodstuffs from the Ukraine and other Russian States for Austria-Hungary. Count Czernin. adds : &quot;We &quot; will agree with the Ukrainian Republic that the old frontiers of Russia and. Austria-&quot; Hungary will also appby to the Ukraine.&quot;][N.B. Since Count Czernin made this speech, he said at Brest on behalf of the Central Powers : &quot; We find ourselves disposed to recognise the Ukrainian Peoples&apos; Republic as an independent, free, and sovereign State,&quot; in spite of the stand taken by M. Trotsky about a Russian &quot; Federal Republic.&quot;] -Poland. -&quot; As regards Poland, the frontiers of which have, up to the present, not been exactly fixed, we do not desire anything at all from this new State. The people of Poland must, freely and without being influenced in any way, settle their own destiny.&quot;Gourland, Lithuania, and the Polish Provinces. Count Czernin reported the differences of opinion between the Russian and German delegates, and added : &quot; It is &apos;.&apos; a cpiestion of finding a middle solution, and it must be found.&quot; . . . &quot;The question &quot; whether or not an honourable general peace can be secured is merely a question of &quot; resistance (sic).&quot;President Wilson&apos;s Speech. &quot; 1&apos; find in President Wilson a significant approximately-tion to the Austro-Hungarian standpoint. . . . In so far as the proposals relate to our Allies German possessions, Belgium, and the Turkish Empire are dealt with in.APPENDIX. to western and General Report No. 54.
them I declare that I, loyal to the obligations of alliance undertaken, am firmly determined to go. to the extreme in defence of the Allies. We will defend the pre-war (sic) possessions of our Allies as our own. ...&quot;As regards internal affairs, Count Czernin politely but categorically refused to accept advice.Taking President Wilsorfs points one&quot; by one [compare Count Ilertling, in last week&apos;s Appendix] : (1) Suppression of secret Diplomacy. &quot; No objection.&quot; , .(2) Liberty of the Seas.- Count Czernin &quot; absolutely and entirely &quot; supported President Wilson&apos;s paragraph.(3) Economic Restrictions. &quot; This article, which pronounces in a formal manner &quot; against a future economic war, is so just and reasonable, and its application has so &quot; often been urged by us, that we have nothing to add to it.&quot;(4c) Limitation of Armaments. &quot; Any voice which made itself heard &quot; in the sense of Count Czerniifs previous statements he &quot;greeted with gratitude.&quot;[(5) Amicable arrangement of all Colonial Claims. Not. touched, upon.](6) Evacuation of Russian Territory. See under Courland, Lithuania, &amp;c, above. Count Czernin added, in dealing with President Wilson&apos;s speech, &quot;We have already shown by acts that we desire to establish good neighbourly relations with Russia.&quot;(7) Belgium. -See above.[Count Czernin, according to the amended reports of his speech, only undertakes-to defend the pre-war possessions of Germany. The first report of his speech published in England was misleading.]1(8) Liberation of French Territory. Not touched upon.](9 to 11.) Italian Frontiers, Nationalities of the Danube Monarchy, and the Balkan States. As regards Italy, Serbia, Montenegro, and Boumania, &quot; I refuse to place a &quot; premium on the military adventures of our enemies. I refuse to make our enemies, &quot; who obstinately persist in wishing to wage war until final victory, one-sided &quot; concessions by which the Monarchy would permanently suffer, and which would &quot; give them the infinite advantage of being able to drag on the Avar, relatively without &quot; risk.&quot;&quot; Italy had before the war an opportunity of realising a great territorial, expansion without firing a shot.&quot; .[It may be noted here that Count Hertling left it to Count Czernin to reply to President Wilson &quot; in the first instance &quot; under these headings.](12) Turkey. See above.[See also note after (7) Belgium.](.13) Poland. &quot; We are also supporters of the creation of an independent Polish &quot; State, which should include all the territories the populations of which are indis-&quot; putabby Polish.&quot; %[See also above, under Poland.]14. League of Nations. &quot; The President would probably meet no opposition from the Monarchy.&quot;&quot; We are, therefore, in agreement in the main . . . . the differences which still exist do not appear to me to be so great that a conversation regarding them would not lead to enlightenment and a rapprochement.&apos;&apos;&apos;Count Czernin added the following words, which indicate clearly his object, to draw the Entente Powers, through the United States, into peace negotiations : -&quot; This situation, which doubtless arises from the fact that Austria-Hungary on the one side, and the United States on the other, are composed of States whose interests nre least in variance with one another, tempts one to ask if an exchange of ideas could not be the point of departure for a personal conversation between all the States which . have not yet joined in the peace negotiations.&quot;Count Czernin concluded his speech Avith. references to the prospect of getting foodstuffs from the Ukraine and. other Russian States, to economic questions and strikes, and to rumours that they Avere prompted by the Government. He made a final appeal for confidence in himself in the conduct of the negotiations at Brest-Litovsh.[Running through the speech there is some indication of sincerity, which is missing in the speech of Count Hertling. Much emphasis is placed on the control of foodstuffs from the Ukraine, which will obviously have much influence on the issue of the Avar.]G. G. A.February 6th, 1918.
