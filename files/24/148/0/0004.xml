secret.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No.  53.PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Peace Discussions.General. Interest centres in the attitude of M. Trotsky on resumption of the meetings of the Brest-Litovsk Conference. The Bolshevist policy appears to he to prolong the discussions in the hope of raising revolutions in Germany and Austria-Hungary, while the German policy is to bring about a peace based on victory, holding on to all territory occupied by their troops. Simultaneously with the general discussion of peace terms, strenuous efforts are being made to ensure that, wherever German armies have been successful, full use shall be made of such success to gain economic advantages. The KaiseFs birthday message to the Reichstag unmasks German policy, and affords good material for propaganda, as it amounts to a confession that Germany&apos;s object in the war is, not the defence of a Fatherland threatened by scheming neighbours, but economic expansion as the result of successful attacks by her armies on those neighbours. In this connection, Sir E. Carson&apos;s report (G. 190), as Chairman of the Economic Offensive Committee, is of special interest.The attitude of Austria-Hungary is obscure. The balance of evidence indicates that the German domination over the Auslro Hungarian delegation to Brest is complete, and that Count czernin has been used as a stalking-horse to try and draw the United States and other enemy countries into a peace conference.The Freedom of the Seas. There is a curious similarity between the views of the Italian organ Stampa (Giolittian.) and those of Count Herding on. this question. Count .1 lertliugs qualified acceptance of President Wilsoii&apos;8 formula is of interest. This subject was dealt with in an appendix to Part 1. of last week&apos;s Report (No. 5.2.;]German Internal Affairs.Last week&apos;s report that only military success against the German armies can avail to lower the prestige of the military caste is confirmed by Sir E. Carson&apos;s memo-rand nm as chairman of the Economic Offensive Committee, from which extracts are given under Peace Discussions, Germany.Finland and the Ukraine.1Events in these countries afford evidence that the Bolshevist policy is to upset all Governments not accepting their tenets.January 31st, 1918.

PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Far Fast. It is suggested to His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Government from a well-informed source that the present, attitude of Japan is one of a certain discontent with the share of the war-so far allotted to her and of pique at the supposed distrust of her intentions. Sir C. Greene learns that the arrival of the Lwami is causing irritation and suspicion at Vladivostock, but Sir G. Barclay reports that both Russian and Rumanian opinion approves the idea of intervention from the East as the only means of dispelling anarchy and countering German influence, lu the general circumstances His Majestjr&apos;s Government has submitted to the Governments of France, Italy and the United States the view that, should circumstances demand the intervention of Japan, she should act as the mandatory of the Allies.American Exports to Russia. Mr. Barclay reports the intention of the United States Government to continue forwarding to Russia locomotives, steel rails, leather and army shoes. The State Department believes that the advantages accruing from such importation more than counterbalance the possible danger of the goods falling into German hands.FRANCE.M. Clemenceau and Intrigues. Lord Bertie, in a despatch dated January 19th, reports the defeat by M. Clemenceau of an attempt by M. Foncet, on behalf of the Socialist Party, to draw the red herring of a &quot;Royalist plot&quot; across the Caillaux trial. He insisted that after the words &quot;La Chambre, fletrissant les rnenees &apos; Royalistes,&apos;&amp;c,&quot; should be added &quot; et autres&quot; in the order of the clay, thereby showing that the Chamber condemned the intrigues of Caillaux as .well as any Royalist intrigues, and over this addition he obtained the substantial majority of 250. The Radical-Socialists have voted the following resolution: &quot;The Radieal-&quot; Socialist group, declaring that justice and truth are far above any question of &quot; persons and of parties, declares that it is more than ever necessary in. the superior &quot; interests of the country that judicial action should be accomplished fully with &quot; absolute respect for the law, apart from all polemies and passion, in order to realise, &quot; with the union of all Frenchmen, the supreme effort which the safety of the country &quot; demands.&quot; The Socialist Party, however, continues to show itself more &quot;Caillauxtiste &quot; than M. Caillaux&apos; own party ; and in view of the fact that a Bolshevist courier (Savizky) is announced by Sir M. Findlay to be arriving shortly in France, the following abstract is given from a report made to the Information^Bureau upon the present attitude of the French Proletariat towards the war : The Proletariat is tired of the war, interested in tbe^xleals of the Russian.Revolution, and afraid of Royalist or Bourgeois reaction. The idea of. international solidarity has, during the-war, been gradually revived principally by German propaganda and by the International Trades Unions Congress Headquarters in Berlin. This revival was stimulated by the refusal of passports for Stockholm and, later, for Petrograd. The srjeeches of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson had a valuable effect (which was improved by the unmasking of German ambitions at Brest Jhtovsk) in demonstrating that the Allies were fighting, not for, but against Reaction and Imperialism. It is pointed out that British and Allied war-aims must be shown to be absolutely ideal and unselfish, and indeed capable of submission to a conference of Allied Socialists sitting, for example, in New York.
BELGIUM.Spirit of the People. The Intelligence Bureau reports the spirit of the Belgian people in the occupied provinces as admirable, in spite of great privations and German cruelty. Quite recently there was a further mass-execution, one of the victims being a girl of 14. Loyalty to King Albert remains general, and Bolshevism has produced no effect except the belief that it will permeate Germany and under-mine militarism. It is reliably stated that some of the German officials originally employed in Belgium have retired, disgusted at.the arbitrary arrests and at having to work with traitor Activist Belgians.Flemish Movement. Count Harrach, the Censor, has permitted a Press campaign, which has stirred up great animosity against, and distrust for the Flemish language ; and has muzzled opposition by persuading the Governor-General, von Falkenhausen, to prohibit legal action being taken in connection with notices passed by the Censor. The so-called &quot;Flemish movement,&quot; which in its inception was purely internal, and never claimed a separate legislature or even separate Ministries, has been exploited by Germany as a national aspiration of unredeemed Germans for deliverance from the French yoke. A small group of Activists has been collected, whose programmes may be classified as follows :-(I) Those who desire the Walloon provinces to be annexed to France, and theFlemish provinces to Germany or Holland. (2) Those who wish to create two completely separate and independent States. (3) Those who wish to create two cantons on the Swiss model within the &quot;cadre &quot;of a single Belgian State.The only strength of the movement is derived from, the fact that it possesses at present the exclusive right of propaganda. But the &quot; Intellectuals &quot; are thoroughly opposed to it, and the masses thoroughly indifferent. The bulk of the Belgian inhabitants believe that sooner or later Germany will be compelled to withdraw from the country, and this does not tend to strengthen the Activist cause.ITALY.Visit of Signor Orlando. Signer Orlando, after a visit to London, has now proceeded to Paris to take part in the deliberations of the Supreme War Council.Enquiry upon the Military Set-bach. The Intelligence Bureau reports that a Committee of Encpury has been entrusted by Royal Decree with the task of investigating and reporting on the causes of and eventual responsibility for the military events which brought about the recent retreat of the Italian Armies to the -Piave, and as to the manner in which the retreat was carried out. It consists of seven members, including General Caneva&apos;(Chairman), Admiral Canevaro, General Ragni, and Signor Raimondo.War Spirit. Sir R. Rodd, in a despatch dated January I6th, points out the Importance of Milan as a centre of pro-Ally sympathy. The Interventionists and the Federation of National Defence have arranged for a monster meeting to be held there. Sir R. Rodd urges the importance of interpreting Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech in a sense satisfactory to the Interventionists, and points out that it has received a suspiciously cordial welcome in pacifist and clerical circles.Anglo-Italian Military- Service Agreement. The Foreign Office has now advised Sir R. Rodd of the arrangements finally approved by the War Office in regard to recruiting British subjects in Italy under the Anglo-Italian Military Service Agreement.PORTUGAL.British altitude towards the New Government. In a despatch dated January 4th, Sir L. Carnegie reports the arguments of Senhor Sidonio Paes for recognition of his
Ministry. Senhor Paes quotes the precedents of General Pimenta de Castro and the-Government succeeding him, hut Sir L. Carnegie has pointed, out to him that in both these cases the President, though acting under compulsion on the second occasion, appointed the Ministry, so that the Constitution was thus outwardly respected. The Foreign Office instructs Sir L. Carnegie that His Majesty&apos;s Government regrets its inability to give immediate formal and official recognition, as such a course would contravene established usage. At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government is-animated - by entire benevolence towards the Provisional Government and desires to extend continued support to Portugal and to avoid any action that might cause-prejudice or embarrassment to Senhor Paes and his Government. -Goal for Madeira, Sugar Factories. Sir L. Carnegie learns that there is a great want of coal in Madeira for the sugar industry and conveys a request by the Portuguese-Foreign Office that His Majesty&apos;s Government will authorise the sale by coal firms in the island of 1,300 tons to recognised factories.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Austrian Strikes. The. Intelligence Bureau points out the parallel between the present political stuation in Austria and that of 1906-07, when the power of the working classes revealed itself for the first time in the monster demonstrations for universal suffrage, and notes that in both cases the spark which lit the flame has come from Russia. The present outbreak has produced four important concessions: first, a promise by the Premier to keep the popular representatives informed regarding the course of the peace negotiations ; secondly, various promises by the Food Con-troller; thirdly, an undertaking by the Minister of the Interior for the extension of universal suffrage to the municipalities, combined with proportional, representation and woman suffrage ; fourthly, an engagement by the Minister of Defence to remove various military restraints upon industrial and munition workers. The whole rnove-men t is essentially a working-class movement, in which, the national element is entirely subordinate. It originated among the Germans of Austria, and at once spread  almost certainly by previous arrangement to the Magyar industrial population of Budapest. It has been followed promptly by a genera!, strike among the Czechs in Prague and other towns. Meanwhile, disintegration is proceeding steadily in the Army,, partly from national causes and partly from exhaustion and declining discipline. A &quot;Communication to Workmen,&quot; appearing in the Arheiter Zeitung, and quoted by Vortoaerts, ends with the significant words : &quot; The power of the working classes is there to guarantee that the above valuable promises do not remain empty words.&quot; Dr. Victor Ad lor addressing a meeting, said: &quot;Ice is broken. Should further &quot; hindrances be put in our way, we are ready, and in. future also our resolution will &quot; not fail. What we have accomplished is far from being enough, but workers are &quot; still there to complete the task.&quot; The Vossische Zeitung of January 22nd, in a long account of the Vienna strikes, reports that they were occasioned by the demand of the bourgeois classes for a positive official assurance that peace without annexation would soon be concluded. The article points out that Maximalist propaganda is being disseminated through the -weekly paper Der Ka.mpf. The Maximalist leader, Otto Bauer, was at the bottom of the strikes in Wienerneustadt; in him. the Government found its chief opponent, and. therefore was forced into negotiating with the more-moderate Socialist elements. The real fight is now between the opposing elements in the Social Democratic party. The official leaders of that party who stand between the Government and the extreme Socialists have achieved complete victory against the former, but only a partial, one against the latter. The historic significance of this popular movement lies in the fact that is the first instance in modern history of a general strike becoming at the psychological moment a decisive factor in the solution of a question of world-wide importance. The workers forced Graf Czernin into a definite declaration concerning peace.Sir II. Rumbold reports a statement by a reliable informant that the Austrian Government, if it did not actually arrange the strikes, certainly knew of them in advance, and would thus appear to wish to have a pretext for refusing any further-military demands by Germany.
GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Alternatives of the Government. The Information Bureau points out that Trotsky&apos;s insistence on the publication of the peace negotiations has created a corresponding discussion between the Annexationists and their opponents in the German Press and the Reichstag. The Government is faced with the problem of accommodating both. The weakened attitude of Austria threatens to encourage the party of &quot;peace by understanding &quot; in Germany. This party associates with its programme the speedy passing of the Prussian Franchise Bill, and attention is being called to the fact that under cover of exuberant patriotism Tirpitz and. the Fatherland Party are really-fighting for the maintenance of Prussianising   Speaking at Munich recently Professor4761-5b BGmint Czcrniii. The Frankfurter Zeitang of January 27th announces that on a Division of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Austrian delegation, a vote of confidence in the Foreign Minister was passed by a two-thirds majority.Recruiting. The  Rheiniscli Westfttkistelie Zeitung publishes a Vienna telegram according to which by the raising of all previous military exemptions a strong addition is to be made to the Austrian Army.Austria, and Poland. A. leading article in Weser, of January 25th, entitled Theory and Practice in Vienna (written before the last speeches of llertling and Czernin), states that Austria, while allowing it to be supposed that she is abandoning the Austro-Polish solution, is in fact quietly engaged upon securing it in furtherance of her dynastic ambition. &quot;All this is of importance as regards relations between Germany and Austria.&quot; The Foreign Office has, however, received information that Germany and Austria have concluded an agreement giving Germany a free hand in Poland and Austria in Ukraine.Austria and the Czechs. The Vossische Zeitung of January 23rd describes stormy scenes which opened the debate in the Austrian Parliament. The Minister President Seidler declared, amidst uproar from the Czechs, that already the Czech declaration of May 30th had been contrary to the interests of the State, while that of January 6th, wherein, they demanded self-determination for Austrian peoples, threatened the break up of the monarchy, and &quot; was the act of the enemy,&quot; to be rejected by every Austrian, and. to be fought against by every means possible. This he was authorised to say by the highest factor in the State. The more quietly he spoke the louder the Czechs roared : &quot; Lies ! Get out Seidler, you are General Hoffmann the second.&quot;   It is still reported that SeidleFs resignation may be shortly expected.Austria)). Economic Policy. The Koelnische Zeitung, of January 21st, reporting a speech made by Dr. Wekerle in the Hungarian Parliament, said, that the Government was doing all in its power to bring about peace, but that irresponsible calls for its speedy conclusion merely added Avar at home to war abroad. In reply to the Independent Deputy Sandar, who reproached the Germans with &quot; forwarding their economic interests in the most brutal manner,&quot; Wekerle replied that &quot;the Germans were certainly in the habit of strongly defending their own interests,&quot; but that Austria also must back hers : &quot; In the great economic field stretching from the North Sea to &quot; the Black Sea. Nay ! even to Asia Minor, Austria cannot merely answer the purpose &quot; of a high road, but must play a leading roZc.&quot;Hungarian Food Control. A Budapest telegram to the Hague announces the resignation of Count Irladik, the Hungarian Food Controller. Sir W. Townley suggests that this is probably in connection with Austrian demands for supplies from Hungary, and that the relations between the two peoples will become still more strained. Prince Luclwig Windischgraetz will be nominated in Count IIadik&apos;s place.Wekerle Cabinet. Sir W. Townley learns that the reorganisation of Count Wekerle&apos;s Cabinet has now taken place. It will receive independent support from the National Party, and the Karolyi Party will also adopt a favourable attitude towards it.
von Aster said: &quot;Our policy must now decide whether its aim is a peace to be &quot; imposed by our strength, which would&apos;he accompanied by autocracy at home, or a &quot; peace by understanding, the accompaniment of which is democracy at home.&quot;Tageblatt reports an agitation by the Fatherland party against the Chief of the Marine Cabinet, Admiral von Muller, and the Master of the Imperial Household, Freiherr Eeischach, the last two men in the KaiseFs Cabinet who, since the fall of Valentini, more or less adhere to the Bethmann-Hollweg era and the so-called July resolutions against annexations and indemnities. The Norddeutsche Allgemaine Zeitung claims authority to deny that their retirement is pending. Sir W. Townley reports that according to the German Press of January 29th Kuhlmann&apos;s position in Reichstag circles is stronger than ever as the result of his last speech in the Main Committee. Mr. Lindley learns that the German delegates before they came to Petrograd were quite unaware of the extent of Russian helplessness, and he doubts whether they now desire a separate peace. Sir W, Townley observes that the Socialist Voricdrts, the Democratic Berliner Tageblatt, and the pan-German Kreu.zze.itung, have all been recently suspended, and suggests that this is &apos; a good indication of the perplexities of the German Government.Suppression of Anti-annexationist Views. Sir W. Townley reports that at the debate in the Reichstag upon the three days&apos; suspension of Vorwarts (for publishing and commenting upon the Austrian strike), it was complained that the recent events were known to all the world but not published in Germany. Deputy Ebert remarked that the military authorities compelled the suppression of this news at a time when the pan-Germans were being given a free hand to incite the public against Austria. He expressed cordial sympathy with the Austrian proletariat, who might be certain that, if necessary, the German labour classes would put their whole strength into the effort to prevent the jeopardising of a &quot; peace by understanding.&quot; Scheidemann said, &quot; Do not forget that conditions with us to-day are very similar to those prevailing in Austria before the outbreak of the strikes.   Do not play with lire i &quot;Censorship. In a Grand Committee of the Reichstag, the Radical Deputy George Gothein produced a packet of articles by the Berliner Tageblatt.&apos;&apos;s naval critic Captain Persius, apparently expressing doubt regarding the inspired assurances that no American force could reach Europe. All these articles had been suppressed. Gothein also stated that General von Vietinghoff, Commanding the Second Army Corps in the district of Stettin, had practically abolished all freedom of the Press in his district, subjecting newspapers to secondary censorship of his own and refusing to accept orders except &quot; direct from the Kaiser.&quot;Sir W. Townley reports that in. consequence of disturbances at meetings of the Fatherland parry iir Stuttgart, the Deputy General of the 13th Wurtemburg Army has prohibited all public meetings for discussion of political questions. The strictest precautions are now necessary if the Fatherland party is to get a hearing anywhere.Popular Unrest. Sir W. Townley reports Minister for the Interior Walrafi as stating in the Main Committee that appeals for a general strike were being distributed amongst workmen, and expressing the hope that they would he; patriotic enough to prevent &quot;irresponsible persons&quot; from breaking through the &quot;inner line.&apos;&apos;&apos; The Independent Socialist Deputy Hofmann, speaking in the Prussian Lower House, said : &quot; You are dancing on a volcano. The writing on the wall in Austria should serve &quot; as a warning. We are as in Austria within ten minutes of catastrophe. People &quot; have had enough of being goaded into Avar. We warn you at the twelfth hour.&quot; The German correspondent of the Dutch newspaper Tyd writes : &quot; It is no wonder &quot; that one hears expressed here and there the fear that if unfortunately some con-&quot; siderable military set-back should be suffered at some point or another, the people, &apos;,&apos; sick of delays in electoral reform, furious against the pan-Germans, physically &quot; enervated and exhausted both in fortune and in the hope of restoration of national &quot; and private felicity, should take the determination of their fate into their own hands. &quot; The failure to obtain a separate peace with Russia would be the signal for an &quot; incalculable reaction of the national forces which are now living upon their last &quot; nerves.&quot;Mr. Lindley learns from a good source that there appears to be a very real, fear of Bolshevism in Germany.
German Psychological and Economic Offensives.--^ leading article in the Kdlnische V oiks zeitung of January 24th advises that &quot;everything should be done on the German side to promote the process of disintegration amongst the Entente by. means of a -campaign to show their peoples without further possibility of doubt the real reasons why we and they are fighting. ... The chief object of this political exposition would be to feed the doubt which already exists in England as to the justice of the Entente war aims and. the possibility of their victory.&quot;. The Kdlnische Zeitung, on the- occasion of the lvaiser&apos;s birthday, observes: &quot;It is only the growing certainty &quot; that victory is not for them which has lowered the tone of our enemies&apos; war &quot; trumpet.&quot;Mr. lindley learns that the Russians have agreed to the resumption of postal and. telegraphic communication with the Central Powers across the front. The despatch of parcels and samples is also permitted. The Russians further assent to German censorship of correspondence.The Economic Offensive Committee represent that, according to conclusive evidence,, the Germans &quot; are determined if possible to gain, an advantage in military arid political &quot; strength (i.e., in the wealth and national organisation which will accrue from an &apos;&quot; aggressive and successful commerce) by a more rapid recovery than their neighbours &quot; from the economic exhaustion caused bj7 the war.&quot;   (G. 190.)The deliberations of the Economic Conference at Brest are of interest in connection with this quotation.Symptoms of Depression.- Sir E. Howard learns from a good source that there is almost universal depression in Berlin. The streets are very badly kept, and there are no carriages. There is no confidence in public men, and even faith in Hindehburg has ceased to be absolute. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the French Ambassador at Berne notices an intense longing for peace in German Switzerland and. is convinced that this reflects a similar longing in Germany.The Department of Information on January 28th issued a valuable precis of the situation in Germany (G.T. 3484), to which further reference will be made in next Aveek&apos;s Report.FINLAND.Recognition. Sir A. Hardinge has received information to the effect that Spain has recognized the independence of Finland. His Majesty&apos;s Consul&apos; at Helsingfors points out that non-recognition of Finnish Independence by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is damaging&quot;Britsh interests in Finland, and is being exploited by the German propaganda. The Press is asking how British subjects can expect protection from an unrecognized Government. The Foreign Office instructs Mr. Barclay to suggest to the United States Government that circumstances now warrant the interim recog-nition of Finnish independence by Great Britain and the United States.German Mini.ster.-The Swedish Press announces the appointment of the German dons ill-General at Gothenburg, Baron von Bruch, as German Minister at Plelsingfors.Bolshevism. Sir E. Howard learns that a revolution has been planned by Finnish Bolsheviks and Red Guards, having as its object a Federal Union with Russia, and reports the occupation of Helsingfors by Red Guards.The Finnish Government has only about 8,000 rifles, and though supported by a large majority in the country, can easily be overpowered. It is stated that the Russian Commissary for War has informed the Finnish Minister that the Russian Government is bound to support the proletariat in Finland against the Bourgeoisie and that he will continue to send help to the Finnish Red Guards. The Finnish Government is said to have appealed to Scandinavia, Germany, Austria, France, England and Greece, protesting against such action. The Swedish paper politihen publishes a manifesto by the Finnish Social Democratic party, demanding the overthrow of the Senate and Administration, abolition of landowners&apos; rights over crofters, immediate relief of unemployment and improvement of food supply. Bourgeois volunteers have blown up the railway bridge at Kiviniemi, on one of the railway routes to Petrograd.   His Majesty&apos;s Consul a-t Helsingfors reports that the
. s-Swedish Charge d&apos;Affaires is alarmed at the pro-German feeling now existing ire Finland, and deprecates the departure of the Baltic Fleet.His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul at Haparanda announces the presence there and at Karungi of an unusual number of Swedish officers, and states that while there is no-evidence that they intend to cross the frontier/the possibility of Swedish intervention must not be overlooked. Sir E. Howard emphasises that this would be preferable to intervention by Germany, which appears to be the probable alternative.Finland and the Allies. The Information Bureau reports the Finnish view as-put by one of the delegates now in England, a member of the Young Finn Party. According to him the Finns, in anticipation of a reversion to autonomy in Russia, are anxious to secure recognition and guarantees by the great Powers while opportunity allows. The Finns fear that, as a result of the war, Germany and Russia may enter into an alliance, the result of which will, be that Germany will take south-eastern Europe as her sphere of influence, and Russia the northern, countries, including Finland. The pro-Germans in Finland consist of a small clique of &quot;Swedes and some of the. Old Finns Conservatives and clergymen. The Radicals, on. the contrary, hope that there will be a revolution in Germany, because a Democracy in Germany would not wish to re-establish an autocracy in Russia. Moreover, commercial circles in Finland, are hostile to Germany, fearing that she will get hold of Finnish commerce, and. they therefore look to the western countries of Europe and the United States, in the hope that they will see fit to provide themselves with a point dappui in Finland,, so as to prevent the Baltic from becoming a German sea. They do this with the more confidence because the democrats in Sweden and,. Norway are also pro-Ally. Again, if there are no large British and French political inerests in the Baltic,. Germany will control the fate of Russia ; but if there arc four small countries neat-Russia dependent directly on Great Britain, France and. the west, that will tend to prevent this absolute German control. There might be an economic penetration of Russia from the west through Finnish agencies. The Swedish pro-German activists wish Sweden to conquer Finland, and by adding its population (3,350,000) to the Swedish population of 5,500,000 to obtain predominance in Scandinavia. But when the question of electing a Swedish or German prince was discussed in November 1917 in the Finnish Diet, not a single member dared to defend, the establishment of a monarchy, and a unanimous resolution was passed in December to-the effect that Finland should become an independent Republic. The attitude of Finland will go far to determine the relations between Russia and the Scandinavian countries. Further, since a pro-German Finland would mean a weakened Sweden and vice-versa, it is clear that Finland holds the key of the situation in the Baltic. An. independent Finland would support the claim of Esthonia to independence, and would retain the A aland Islands, if it is objected that some threes thousand Finns fought for the Germans, it may be replied, first, that they did so to win their freedom from Russia ; secondly, that there are several thousand Finns in the British Mercantile Marine. The Swedish party in Finland, although, the most educated, only composes one-tenth of the Diet, and exerts little influence in Finnish political life.   To-day the Social Democratic Party is particularly strong.NETHERLANDS.Java Sugar. Sir W. Townley reports that there appears to be a scheme on foot to-force up the price of the unsold residue of the 1917 crop of Java sugar by prohibiting-the exportation of the 191.8 crop.SWITZERLAND.Tonnage for Sioiss acquirements. The Foreign Office informs Sir H. Rumbold that, arrangements are in progress under which 150,000 tons of Dutch shipping now in United States ports will be available, partly for Swiss requirements.Wheat Supply. According to the War Trade Intelligence Report the United States Government is unable to supply wheat for Switzerland, and has decided that all Swiss -supplies must be drawn from the Argentine.
0 9SWEDEN.   .&apos;Inter-Scandinavian Exchange. Sir E. Howard reports that the Inter-Scandinavian Exchange Conference concluded&apos; its Stockholm session on January 20th. Various decisions were reached and published. The Conference will meet at Copenhagen in February and work out a final scheme.Iron-ore Exports. Sir E. Howard reports that he has the concurrence of the American, French, and Italian Ministers in the view that Sweden would agree to divide her exports of iron ore equally between the two belligerent camps. He suggests that the Swedish public should be made aware of-the superiority of British over German offers of supply, and of the fact, that their rejection by the Swedish Government can be due only to capitalist interests and German threats.A aland Islands. The Intelligence Bureau reports the growing interest of Sweden in the settlement of the Aaland cpiestion. The islands have been a menace to her since they were, early in tire war, garrisoned by Russian troops. The islanders, who number about 25,1)00, and are almost without exception of Swedish origin, have assembled in their parishes and voted for union with Sweden. Opinion in Finland is divided upon the project of ceding the islands to Sweden, though in both camps there are those &quot;who regard it as an act of justice to the declared will of the inhabitants and a judicious political move demanded by the necessities of the situation and by Swedehs not unjustified, desire to safeguard her frontiers. Sir lb Howard reports that the Swedish Government is strongly inclined to send a delegate to Brest-Li to vsk in order to secure from the German and Russian Governments a formal declaration in favour of the neutralisation of the Aaland Islands. The Nya Daglight Allehanda is quoted by the German Wireless Press of January 24th as follows : &quot; This step on the part of Germany, as far as we are able &quot; to see, is not only a fully justified, but is also, from our point of view, an altogether &quot; happy diplomatic stroke. Since England, by her co-operation in the violation of &quot; the Aaland Treaty, and afterwards by her refusal to recognise the independence of &quot; Finland, has shown how her interests in the freedom and the future of the nations &quot; living on the Baltic really stand, ic appears ail the more significant that the German &apos;&quot;&apos; statesmen have in mind their rights as signatories of the Aaland Treaty, which they &quot; are now endeavouring to exercise in order to demand that fresh guarantees &quot; against the fortifying of the Islands shall be created. State Secretary von &quot; Euhlmann is undoubtedly right when he assumes [that the wash of the Swedish &quot; nation is to obtain by means of peaceful negotiations with the States bordering on &quot; the Baltic the earliest possible solution of the questions of such importance for &quot;Sweden. The Swedish nation will welcome with general satisfaction the prospect &quot; of being represented in the negotiations at Rrest-Litovsk regarding the &quot;Aaland &quot; question.&quot; The same paper quotes a telegram from Berlin stating that Kiihlnianids remarks are considered in Berlin to show that in spite of Sweden&apos;s negotiations with the Entente, the attitude of Germany towards Sweden is unchanged. The negotiations with England are designed to remove temporary difficulties, but the common interests of Sweden and Germany are permanent. Sir E. Howard has pointed out that the Swedish. Government would thus be negotiating with a Government which it does not acknowledge, and the stability of which is very doubtful ; that the negotiations would be carried on in the absence of some of the signatories of the Treaty of Paris ; and that since the only real danger is that the Aaland forts might fall into German hands, Sweden would do better to ask Germany for a guarantee that she would not occupy the islands. The Finns could be requested to arrange with Russia for the withdrawal of Russian troops, and then persuaded to destroy the forts. Upon his suggestion the Foreign Office has instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ministers at Christiania and Copenhagen to approach the Norwegian and Danish Governments in this sense. Sir E. Howard observes that the Socialist Press openly deprecates the proposal to send a delegate. The Swedish Press of January 23rd reproduces a letter published in a Finnish paper by Mr. Sundblom, who represents  Aaland  in  the  Finnish4761. -Ob CCotton Exports.--The Foreign Office has pressed the French and Italian Clovern-ments to expedite instructions to their representatives at Berne, in order that they may join with the British and United States Ministers in a note to the Swiss government -ment on the question of cotton exports.   (See Reports, Nos. 51 and 52.)
Landtag. He describes acts of violence committed in Aaland by Russian soldiers, and appeals to the Finnish authorities to apply to the Russian Government for their removal. Failing this, it will be necessary for Aaland to appeal to Sweden to occupy the islands. The Swedish Press announces that a deputation of five A aland ers has arrived at Stockholm to express on behalf of 90 per cent, of the inhabitants their desire to come under Swedish administration. A member of the deputation states that about 4,000 Russian soldiers are terrorising the population, which is threatened with complete anarchy and famine.Pro-German Discrimination by Bolshevist Commissary. Sir E. Howard reports that the Bolshevist Commissary has refused a passport to Russia to the correspondent of the Social Deviokrateri. The Dagens Nyheier observes that this refusal is all the more significant as no difficulties were placed in the way of the representative of the pro-German and ultra-Conservative Aftonblad, who has left for Russia to interview Trotsky about the import of cereals to Sweden.DENMARK.Rubber Imports from Russia. Sir R. Pa get reports that offers of motor-car and bicycle tyres are being received by Danish firms from Russia. At present-practically nothing is being exported from Denmark to Russia, owing partly to anxiety about Russian conditions and partly to the official desire to conserve supplies.Fish Exports to Sweden. The Foreign Office advises Mr. Barclay (at Washington) and Sir R. Paget that pending a final agreement between Denmark and the United States, His Majesty&apos;s Government has no objection to the export of Danish fish to Sweden provided that, first, the Swedish export prohibition becomes effective, and secondly, full statistics are rendered monthly.SPAIN.Unrest. Sir A. Hardinge reports the declaration on January 25th of a state of siege at Barcelona. An informant (of moderate reliability) states that the proclamation-mation was preceded by acts of passive sabotage, such as misuse of machinery, by workmen. The Reservists are mistrusted and have not been called out. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Malaga learns from various sources that there is a danger of the present disturbances culminating presently in a sort of pro-German dictatorship, which may,result in the embarrassment of France upon the Pyrenees border. It is stated that the Church party has incited the military party to attempt this coup.CHINA.Export Prohibitions. Sir J. Jordan reports that the Chinese Government has agreed to prohibit exports by sea to Adadivostock. Idle Foreign Office instructs him to concert with Sir C. Greene in preventing attempts to evade this prohibition by shipping via Japan. Exports from Harbin, whether to East or West, have already been stopped.Enemy Aliens. Discussions continue between Sir C. Greene and the Chinese Government, upon the question of deporting enemy aliens to Australia. The number of these is about 3,290, of whom 1,724 are women and children. Although it is probable that the Chinese Government will ultimately consent, considerable hesitation is shown, and it appears that this is largely due to dissuasion by the Dutch Minister, working upon the national pride of the Cabinet, in which a strong pro-German party still exists.
Unrest. Sir J. Jordan reports that the President has left Peking to consult with the military authorities at Tientsin and Tsi-nan-fu. The fact is that the Government has lost control of the country south of the Yangtze, and the President probably; intends to try the effect of a military demonstration by Northern troops. Pressure is being brought to bear upon him to declare Avar upon the South. Sir 0. Greene reports that&quot; the Japanese Foreign Minister considers the action of the President to be due to party ambitions and intrigues and likely to result in consequences which would be detrimental to the Allies. According to Sir J. Jordan rumours of a restoration of the monarchy are again prevalent in Peking.ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.Wheat Convention. Sir R. Tower reports  thatthe   Wheat Convention  was -unanimously approved by the Senate on January 21st, and was promulgated the next day.URUGUAY.Enemy Submarines. The Foreign Office instructs Mr. Mitchell Lines to assure the Uruguayan Government of the full support of His Majesty&apos;s Government in any&quot; dispute with the Central Powers in regard to the internment of enemy submarines. Questions arising between the Uruguayan and Argentine Governments concerning territorial jurisdiction should not, however, involve His Majesty&apos;s Government, which is making separate representations to the Argentine Government.BRAZIL.Censorship. Sir A. Peel reports that telegrams referring to dangerous German firms in connection with transfers of funds, and orders for foodstuffs are daily being sent from Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Ayres through the Swiss Legation to the Foreign Office at Berne. Sir A. Peel and the United States Ambassador therefore submit to their respective Governments the desirabilitjr of a responsible Brazilian censorship at Rio, to be assisted by Allied cable censors in touch with the United States Embassy and the British and French Legations.GUATEMALA.Earthquakes. Mr. Young reports the recurrence of earthquakes on January 24th. Fears are expressed of a further eruption. All public buildings and churches, nearly all dwelling houses and half of the offices in the centre of the city are in ruins. The problem of housing salved merchandise is acute. Good order is maintained. A Commission of doctors and engineers has arrived from the United -States with supplies and 4,000 army tents.COLOMBIA.Order restored. Mr. Wyndham reports that order has now been restored, and the order proclaiming a state of siege revoked.MEXICO.Possible Danger to Oil fields.-The Foreign Office learns that the Commander-in-Chief of the campaign against Pelaez has stated his desire to avoid causing danger to  the  employes  in  the oilfields.   The Oil Association is not feeling alarmed.
Mr. Cummins is, however, apprehensive that the resistance of Pelaez may begin in the area of the wells.German Propaganda. Mr. Cummins reports the constant publication by German-paid organs of libels and incitements against the Allies, and enquires wdiether the United States Government can be persuaded to bring pressure on the Mexican Government to suppress them.LIBERIA.Allied Assistance. The Foreign Office advises Mr. Barclay that His Majesty&apos;s Government is considering the provision of financial assistance to the Government of Liberia, and that the , French Government is being approached in the matter. Mr. Barclay is instructed to inquire whether the United States Government is willing, to participate.UNITED STATES.Jewish and Catholic Opinions on Zionism, The Foreign Office learns that Yiddish papers in the United States are now adopting a pro-Ally attitude. There is still, however, an inclination among Catholics to resent the - stress laid upon Zionist aspirations. Measures are under consideration for alleviating any possible resentment by either community.Criticism of the War Department. Mr. Barclay reports that a profound sensation has been caused by Senator Chamber! ain;s denunciation of the War Department. Founding his indictment on depositions made before the Military Affairs Committee of the Senate, he-emphasised the failure of the Ordnance Department, the lack of army clothing, and the bad conditions of the camps. The Press, while acknowledging the justice of these criticisms, regrets the initiation of party controversy at a time when unity is essential. It seems probable, however, that much good will ultimately result from the incident. The demand for a Minister of Munitions has to a large extent been met by the appointment of Mr. Stettinius as Surveyor-General for all Army purchases.Military Service Convention. An agreement between the British and United States Governments is under consideration, according to which all male British, citizens in the United States of 20 to 40 years of age, and all male citizens of the United States in Great Britain of 20 to 30 years of age shall become liable to service in the forces of their country of residence unless they return (within (JO days from the date of the agreement) to their own country for military service.SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. According to the W&apos;ar Trade Intelligence Report the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in. the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period January 18th-24th inclusive was 07,501 tons gross, of which 46,089 tons were British, as compared with 45,018 tons gross, of which 12,67b tons were British, reported last week.The Admiralty reports that during the week ending January 19th one-half of the losses have occurred in the Mediterranean. For the first time for many weeks the Channel and the Irish Sea were not the areas of greatest submarine activity.The Admiralty points out that the net losses for the five months ending December 31st, 1917, amounted to 556,476 gross tons, and emphasises the necessity of releasing from the Army 20,000 shipyard workers and marine engineers, with a view to reducing these losses by increased production.
1.3Building. The Ministry of Shipping reports on January 2Gth that of 307 ships aggregating 1,68!.,230 tons dead-weight contracted for by His Majesty&apos;s Government, 158 aggregating 960,890 tons dead-weight purchased in the United States have been requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board, leaving a balance of 1-19- ships aggregating 720,340 tons dead-weight at British disposal.Norwegian Tonnage. Sir M. Fjndlay reports strong criticism of His Majesty&apos;s Government in connection, with the loss of the S.S. Eha, which is believed by Norwegians to have been caused, by disregard of an. agreement made with the Grocers&apos; Association. He points out that it is highly important that other Norwegian vessels should not be similarly endangered, as this might injuriously affect the attitude of the Storthing towards the agreement with, the United Stales.Dutch, Shipping in American Boris. The War Trade Intelligence Report announces that the Dutch Government has accepted the proposal of the United States War Trade Board that Dutch ships now in American ports shall be chartered to the United States Shipping Board for 90 days. . It is hoped that 150,000 tons of Dutch shipping will, under this arrangement, become available for the service of the Belgian Relief Commission and for carrying grain to Switzerland.Food Imports.  The hood Controller points out that the estimated deficiencies for -cereals, sugar, and bacon and hams indicate a total estimated deficiency of nearly 541,000 tons or 28 per cent, on arrivals of foodstuffs during the first two months of the year J 9] 8 ; -and insists on priority being given to shipments of foodstuffs so as to cover not only the tonnage estimated-to lie needed for arrivals of foodstuffs in each particular mouth of .1918 up to the programme (totalling .1.3,056,000 tons) approved by the War Cabinet, but also the deficiencies of the earlier months of the year, as he may require.Allied Shipping Committee The Shipping Controller requests the War Cabinet to appoint two Ministers to represent His Majesty&apos;s Government at meetings, in London or Paris, of Allied shipping representatives.Enemy Sailings. During the week ending January 19th, seven enemy- ships arrived at, and five sailed from, Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat. None entered or left Rotterdam.Russian Volunteer Fleet. According to the German Wireless Press of January 28th the Voluntary Fleet of the Commercial Shipping Companies of Russia has been transferred by State Decree to the command of the Revolutionary Sailors&apos; Union, and the capital of the companies has been seized.Russo-Turltish Combine. The German Wireless Press of January 28th also mentions a report that negotiations are proceeding between the Russian, and Turkish plenipotentiaries regarding the establishment of a shipping combine between Russian and Turkish ports, especially Odessa and Constantinople.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. According to a report from Mr. Lindley, M. Trotsky returned, to Petrograd on January 21st, further peace negotiations at Brest having been postponed for 10 days.   &quot; Conversations &quot; of the special delegations were being carried on.Sir W. Townley reports the return of von Kuhlmann and Count Czernin to Brest on January 29th. The conspicuous feature of the conversations held in the interval, according both to diplomatic and to wireless reports, has been, the haste with which, the Germans have been pressing on the opening up of economic relationship, -especially with the Ukraine.   This feature is dealt with more fully under Germany.The Intelligence Bureau, on January 25th, represent that there can &apos;be no compromise between the Bolshevists and Germany on account of their aims being fundamentally different. The chance of revolution in Germany and Austria-Hungary is what makes the Central Powers anxious for a speedy peace, and provides an inducement to the Bolshevists to delay it.47Gi-ofc n
The Military Attache at Petrograd has ascertained (January 27th) on good authority that during the peace negotiations at Brest before the adjournment it was evident that the Austro-Mtingarians, Turks, ami Bulgarians were only prevented by the Germans from making concessions to obtain peace at once.Russia.- Russian Wireless of January 23rd announces that, at the Session of the Economic Commission, at Brest, there was a difference of opinion between the Russians and the Austro-Germans. The principles of a new commercial treaty were, discussed.Russian Wireless of the same date publishes an announcement &quot; To All &quot; of a -message sent to von Kfddmann and to Count Czernin protesting against the intentional abbreviation of the Minutes of the Brest Conference as published by the newspapers of the Central Powers, and accusing the Germans especially of entirely misleading public opinion in. Germany by keeping back important inform a-tion. Trotsky announced that, after a fortnights negotiation, the Central. Powers still insist on-putting evasive questions on their demands, which are in violent contradiction to the principles recognised by the Declaration of December 25th.Mr. Lindley reports on January 2Gth that, at the Soviet Congress, terms of peace had not yet been formally discussed, but that it was reported on good authority that there was a 4considerable majority in favour of rejecting the German terms, and it was probable that Trotsky would refuse these terms when, he returned to Brest, his object being to strengthen the Bolshevist position, in the Western countries.The Military Attache at Petrograd reports on January 28th that Trotsky left Petrograd on the previous night for Brest. The formula which he will propose is that of the Left Social Revolutionaries : &quot; That Russia could only make peace with Germany on democratic lines.&quot; If Germany refuses to accept this formula, Trotsky is to tell the Central Power delegates that Russia reserves for herself free action in the future, and that by forming a new Socialistic army they will be in a position to insist on their democratic terms being agreed to.Ukraine. According jo German Wireless, von Kuhlmann stated to the Reichstag Committee on January 25th that representatives of the Ukraine Rada were recognised without objection and indeed with approval by the Russian Delegation as the representatives of the Kieff unit at Brest. The solemn recognition, of the Ukrainian Republic has not yet taken place. In the circumstances, however, this may be expected on the conclusion of peace with Ukrainia.On January 26th Air. Lindley reported that the original Rada seemed to have come to an agreement with the Central. Powers, but were losing their influence. A new Bolshevist Rada has sent representatives to Brest, and they denounce the earlier Ukrainian representatives as not representing the country. The second Ukraine representatives (Bolshevists) have been recognised by M. J off e as entitled to take part in the peace negotiations.According to reliable information received from Kieff via Jassy, dated January 26th,. the delegates are instructed to make peace with the Central Powers,, and steps are being taken to facilitate the export of resources of the Ukraine to Germany.Finland-. According to a report from a Swedish newspaper, quoted in German. Wireless of January 28th, the Finnish Diet has appointed a delegation Avhich is to represent Finnish interests at the Brest-Litovsk peace negotiations.Germany. Russian Wireless of January 27th issued a complete shorthand report of the Session of the Economic Commission at Brest on. January 19th, at which some-what acute differences of opinion between the Russian and German delegates were disclosed. The Germans put forward the point that the projects they had submitted before Christmas were German and not Austro-Rungarian proposals. The commercial treaty was discussed without any final conclusion being come to.Mr. Lindley reported on January 27th that on commercial questions the German proposal is that the parties concerned shall undertake to end commercial war simu-l-taneously with hostilities, and that they shall lake no direct or indirect part - in any further hostile economic measures which ma)&apos; be taken; during the period of transition between war and peace that the parties shall undertake to put no hindrance in the way of exchange of goods or allow private persons to do so. This exchange is considered the first necessity and a Commission should, be established at once in order to hasten it.
Iii bis birthday message (January 27th) to the President of the Reichstag the Kaiser accentuates the economic advantages that Germany may expect to gain by a military victory in the following words : &quot;The final victory of our arms, the founda-&quot; lion on which, rests the joyous renewed development of its (the German peopled) &quot; moral and economic strength.&quot;Describing the result of the Economic Commission at Brest von Kuhhnann said iii the. Peichstag that according to the Russian view the conditions for reopening of trade.relations are not yet possible. The endeavours of the Commission were being limited to re-establishing means of transport between countries who were contracting parties, lie expressed hope that, in spite of difficulties, the Economic Commission would result in the transition of negotiations into practice, which will be carried into effect without further loss of time.in connection with the German economic offensive, as applied to peace negotiations with Russia and to the Ukraine, the following extracts from a report by Sir Edward Carson, as Chairman of the Economic Offensive Committee, are of interest:-&quot; We strangely misinterpret the spirit of Germany if we imagine that a commercial boycott, or the threat of a commercial boycott, can ever become a substitute for a victory in the field. I do, however, believe most firmly that when the final issue of the stricken field, begins to appear grave and. doubtful to German eyes, the economic menace may &quot;. then play a most important part in the war.&quot;   (G. 190.   January 21st.)The speech delivered to the main committee of the Reichstag on January 25th by the imperial Chancellor, Count fieri ling, is summarised in an Appendix to this Report. From the British point of view, special interest is attached to his reference to President Wilson&apos;s proposal (see Appendix to Parti, of last week&apos;s Report) that the freedom of the seas shall be subject to international control in peace and war : &quot; The limitation mentioned by Mr. Wilson at&apos; the end is unintelligible. Itappears superfluous, and should, therefore be suppressed.&quot;Count Reventlow. expressed Count Hertlinga meaning in somewhat clearer language last February, he said that the freedom of the seas sought for by Germany was &quot; not an international but a German freedom.&quot;hlerr Kiihlmambs speeches to the Reichstag Main Committee on January 25th and 26th contain the following points of interest: On the subject of &quot; self-determination,&quot; if an agreement could be come to with Trotsky about the manner of the final voting, they could leave the question an open one as to how far the previous voting should be presumed to have represented the view of the people. Trotsky could maintain his standpoint and the Germans could maintain theirs, and nothing would be altered in the final result. Herr Kuhhnann added that he did not believe that the negotiations would fail upon that question.Speaking about the cause of the war, he said that he believed that, if one examines the most recent causes, one would find that the conviction of men in power at the time in Russia that they would either have to create an outlet by means of a great war, or be swallowed up by a revolution in the interior, very materially contributed in giving to Russian policy that direction which led to this world war. The unity of the empire has completely disappeared in Russia.In replying to Count Westarp, who had said that the German delegation did not make its position clear enough about annexations, von Kuhhnann said that in this matter there are not many differences of view, and he believed that Count Westarp supported &quot; the seizure of what lias been gained by our military successes. Declarations on this subject in advance are impossible for the German Government.&quot; In describing his attitude towards the military authorities, von Kuhlmann used the following words : &quot; Cordial co-operation between the Peace Delegation and the Supreme Army &quot; Administration which is undoubtedly necessary in the continuation of this waiyis, as &quot; I also believe, as perfect as regards arrangements made as can be considered possible, &quot; having in mind the imperfection of human things.&quot;On January 28th Sir W. Townley sent extracts.from the German Press articles on Count Hertl.ing&apos;s speech. - Only the Vorwarts seems to grasp the fact that &quot; it was calculated to arouse the distrust of the Allies.&quot;The Intelligence Bureau reported on January 23rd that accounts from Germany pointed to some really serious difference in the highest quarters, and the Government was obviously embarrassed. They cannot enter into negotiations without facing definite problems, the solution-of ivhich at once brings out greater opposition between the two currents of. opinion which have divided the nation for more than a.year.   The
handful of intellectuals who see great dangers ahead in continuing the war for annexationist objects may not exercise much influence as yet, hut their arguments are now being reported at somewhat greater length in the Press.Austria-Hungary. Interest centres in Count Czernihs speech on war aims, of which a precis will be attached to next week&apos;s Report, when fuller accounts will be available. The outstanding points are his disinterment of the formula, &quot;peace without annexations or indemnities,&quot; in spite of the interpretation put upon the expression by the German delegates at Brest, and the special, advance made to President Wilson.Sir W. Townley reports on January 27 th a rumour that Count Czerniifs suggestion for peace negotiations between Austria-Hungary and America was due to influence coming from Berlin. Czernin. is reported to have accepted the German stimulation in the hope of economic help from America in reconstruction work after the war. Count OzernhPs views upon territorial integrity are probably bused upon the existing military situation.On January 28th Sir W. Townley reported on a leading article in the Kolnische Volkszeltung, entitled &quot; Austria-Hungary and Wilson,&quot; which contains the words:  &quot; Count Czernin is a statesman who not only speaks but also acts in spirit which &quot; animates his foreign policy. He gave new proof of this when he threw out the &quot; suggestion of possible exchange of thought between Austria and United States, two &apos;&quot; countries who have fewest differences between, them, as possibly leading to conversation between all those Powers which have not yet found common ground &quot; for their discussion of peace terms. . .&quot; The Austrian newspapers state that in a reply to a Socialist Deputy, Count Czernin has stated that he did not say that lie had submitted his speech to President Wilson before delivery, but that it was in the Presidents hands in English at the time he delivered it.The general impression conveyed by the incomplete, accounts so far received is that Count Czernin is being used as a stalking-horse by Germany in order to draw the United States of America and Entente Countries into a peace conference. This impression is confirmed by Sir W. Townley&apos;s telegram of -January 27th, and by the report of the conclusion of the speech in the General. Stall daily review of January 26th : &quot; Austria-Hungary and the United States practically agree. ... It &quot; is obvious to me that an exchange of views between the two countries might form a &quot; starting-point for conciliatory discussions between all the States which have not yet &quot; ente.red,into peace negotiations.&quot;France. Lord Bertie reported on January 25th a criticism in the Temps on Count Hertling&apos;s speech on war aims in which attention is drawn to the remarkable difference in the tone of Count Uertling a and Count Czerniids speeches, excepting about Alsace-Lorraine where tliey both agree.On January 27th Lord Bertie reported that M. Albert Thomas in a speech at Bordeaux has declared that the Drench peace aims are prevention of German domination, liberation of peoples subject to Germany or Austria, restoration of small nationalities, and a society of nations to guarantee the peace of the world. To these aims every democracy should subscribe. The French Socialist Party did not want a party peace, but a national one. But while being at one &quot;with, the nation in this desire, it did. not seem to be at one with, the Government. Disagreement of the Socialist party with. Clemenceau was due to the latt,er&apos;s distrust of popular forces and his unwillingness to utilise such forces.Italy. Sir Rennell Rodd on January 23rd urged the importance of reassuring the Italian. President of the Council, on the subject of the British, war aims as affecting Italy.The Intelligence Bureau reports on January 25th that the Stampa (Giolittian journal) says that Italy and France have every reason to agree with President Wilson&apos;s pronouncement concerning the freedom of the seas. and. hints at the internatioualisa-tion of Gibraltar, Aden, and the Suez Canal.  [Compare Count Hertling, see Appendix.]President Wilson&apos;s friendly note in speaking of Russian revolutionaries is little to the taste of the Italian internationalists who have too much to fear from their own Bolshevists, and their attitude towards Russian Bolshevists is one of exaggerated hostility. tAccording to newspapers in. closest touch with the Foreign Office, the Italian view is that, if other Powers are to gain, Italy must gain also, but if other Rowers renounce all gains, Italy is prepared to do the same.
Switzerland. Sir H. Rumbold reports on January lOtli an interview with the new President, M. Oaldoner, who stated that he thought Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech very able, and that the Germans ought to he able to agree to every word of it except the portion relating to Alsace-Lorraine. The Austrians would doubtless object to that part of the. speech which referred to the legitimate claims of the Italians for reunion with those of their own race and language. President Galonder had great hopes of the establishment of a league of nations after the Avar.The great longing for peace in Switzerland is thought by the French Ambassador to reflect the same longing which &quot; undoubtedly prevails in Germany.&quot;Sweden. Sir E. Howard reports on January 22nd, on the authority of the Italian Minister, that a Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated on January 21st that Sweden had not yet been invited by the Germans to send a representative to Brest to discuss the question, of the Aland Islands. The Italian Minister thinks, that if invited, SAveden will be likely to agree to send a representative. A Bolshevist paper at Stockholm thinks this is a German trap and is against a delegate being sent.Propaganda. (United Kingdom.) The Ministry of Labour reported on January 23rd that there is a considerable stiffening of opinion in British labour, both about Avar aims and other aspects of Avar and peace, resulting partly from the recent speeches of the Prime Minister and President Wilson, and partly from the apparent triumph of the military party in Germany.GENERAL.Hospital Ships. :The Foreign Office informs Sir W. Townley that there is no doubt that the Hospital Ship &quot; Rewa &quot; Avas torpedoed, in spite of the German denial, which must moreover have been issued before the return, to port of enemy submarine which might have been, concerned. Sir W. Townley is to ask the Nether-lands Government to instruct its Minister in Berne to protest in the strongest terms to the German Government and to point out that the aressel Avas sunk, far outside the zones in which Hospital Ships are threatened by public announcements of the German Government.Tuhercidous Prisoners. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the Swiss Government is willing to intern tuberculous civilian prisoners in Switzerland, but is ascertaining their approximate number before communicating its official, assent.Prisoners in Germany. Sir W. Townley learns that the Swiss Medical Corn-mission, Avhich qualifies prisoners in Germany for internment in neutral countries does not in fact visit camps, but merely inspects certain prisoners selected by the German Authorities. He therefore enquires Avhether he is authorised to forward the names of individuals to the Dutch Legation in Berlin, with a view to their presentation by the German Government for inspection by the Swiss Commission.Sir W. Townley learns that officers of the Flying Corps captured by the Germans are regularly depriArecl of their helmets, gloves and flying coats, which are then used by the enemy.Lord Bertie learns that the Germans have interned a number of officer prisoners of Avar at Stuttgart, Frankfort and LudAvigshaA^en, thus exposing them to Allied air raids.German Prisoners in England. The Eheinisch Weatfalisehe Zeitung states that in an interview with a correspondent at the Hague, the &quot; Hero of the Emden &quot; com-plained of the treatment of himself and other German prisoners as being &quot;certainly not as chivalrous as is commonly sripposed in Germany.&quot;Austrian Proposed to Greece.  Lord Granville reports a proposal by the Austro-Plungarian Government to the Greek Government under which nationals of each country, Avithout distinction of sex or age, should be repatriated. The Foreign Office has replied that such an arrangement is to be deprecated as counter to established policy.
APPENDIX: to western and General Report No. 53.  Part II.Speech by the German Imperial Chancellor, Count Hertling, to the Main Committee of the Reichstag on January 25th, 1918, as reported by German Wireless on the same day.Introduction. Count Hertling-in his opening statement explained that negotiations with the Russian delegation at Brest-Litovsk were progressing slowly and were exceedingly difficult. The negotiations with the representatives of Ukrainia &quot; stand favourably,&quot; and &quot; we hope in the near future to arrive at a settlement with Ukrainia &quot; winch will be to the interests of both sides, and which should also be advantageous &quot; as far as their economic aspect is concerned.&quot;[In studying this statement it is interesting to note that, according to the latest information, the Ukrainian delegation referred to represented the Rada first established, and that the Bolshevists have now set up a second Rada which, is to send another Ukrainian delegation to the Brest Conference. Another point of special interest is the haste displayed by Germany in pressing for economic influence and advantages simultaneously with the conduct of peace negotiations. The same policy has been disclosed at Brest in dealing with the Russian Bolshevists. Sir Edward Carson&apos;s paper G. 190 of January 21 st predicted this aspect, of German policy in the words : &quot; They (the Germans) are determined if possible to gain an advantage in &quot; military and political strength (j.c, in the wealth and national organisation which &quot; will accrue from an. aggressive and successful commerce) by a more rapid recovery &quot; than their neighbours from the economic exhaustion caused by the war. Our &quot; knowledge of their intentions is not a mere surmise based upon, what we have &quot; recently learned of their pre-war activities,&quot; but upon &quot;abundant evidence of their &quot; determination to gain a relative advantage over us in the first decade of peace.&quot; The German attitude towards the Russian Bolshevists and the Ukrainians at Brest amply supports the view expressed by Sir E. Carson as Chairman of the Economic Offensive Committee.]Scope of the Brest Conference. Owing to Russia&apos;s Allies not having answered the Bolshevists&apos; invitation to take part in the Conference by 10 pun. on January 4th, the date fixed by the Germans, Count Hertling stated &quot; that we are bound no longer in &quot; any way so far as the Entente is concerned, that we have a clear road in front of us &quot; for separate negotiations with Russia, and also that, obviously, we are no longer &quot; bound in any way, as far as the Entente is concerned, to the proposals for a general &quot; peace which have been submitted by the Russian delegation.&quot;Reply to Mr. Lloyd George. Count Hertling then referred to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech., to which he did not attempt to reply in detail, contenting himself with an appeal to German sentiment: &quot;We are supposed to be culprits over whom the &quot;Entente is sitting in judgment.&quot; &quot;This is a spirit, gentlemen, with which, &quot; naturally, we can have nothing to do,&quot; and so on. At the same time he reverts to the old and vague &quot; encirclement &quot; argument which was used in 1914 to work upon the fears of the German &quot;people, in order to work up hate and fury against their neighbours, and ensure support for an aggressive policy. He attributes the origin of the war to &quot; the danger of enemy coalitions which threatened the Allied Central Powers.&quot; The dream of coalitions became a reality owing to &quot; the hemming-in policy of King Edward.&quot; At the same time the German alliance with Austria &quot;was a purely defensive alliance,&quot; and German &quot; armaments were forced upon us for defence against the danger threatening us from our enemies.&quot; Referring to his former similar statements, he complains that &quot; it does not seem that these words were in any way heeded by foreign countries.&quot;[As usual in German statements about the origin of the war, no proof is put forward of the alleged aggressive intentions of neighbouring countries in 1914, and the point that foreign countries have judged Germany by her acts rather than by her words has not been grasped.]The only allusion in detail by Count Hertling to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech refers to Alsace-Lorraine, which Provinces he claims to have been German up to 1789, and what occurred in 187.1. was &quot; dis-annexatibn,&quot; which was &quot; expressly recognised by
&quot; the French National Assembly and the constitutional representatives of the French &quot; nation &quot; (March 29th, 1871). He quoted ,a letter by Thomas Carlyle to the Times in. December 1870 as evidence that &quot; people &quot; in England &quot; at that time spoke very differently from what they do to-day.&quot;Reply to President Wilson. He then replied in detail to the fourteen points of President Wi.lson&apos;s speech on war aims : (L) No Secret International Agreements. Count Hertling claimed that Germany has led the way, and quotes as an example the &quot;full publicity given to the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk.&quot;[It is interesting to compare the message &quot;To All&quot; in Russian Wireless of January 23rd, protesting strongly against the intentional abbreviation of the reports published -in Germany of the Minutes of the Conference, and accusing-the Germans of intentionally misleading public opinion by keeping back important ireformation.](2) The Freedom of the Seas. Count Hertling claimed that &quot; there is no-difference of opinion whatever.&quot; But he added &quot;the restriction mentioned by Mr. Wilson towards the end is incomprehensible and seems superfluous,&quot;&apos; and suggested the abandonment by Great Britain of her fortified naval bases on shipping routes.[The same view was put more clearly by Count Reventlow in February 1917, when, he explained that the freedom of the seas sought for was &quot;not an an international but a German freedom.&quot;](3) Abandonment of Economic Restrictions. &quot;With this we wholly agree.. We also condemn economic war.....&quot;(&apos;J) Limitation of Armaments. &quot; A matter quite.suitable for discussion.&quot;(o) Amicable Arrangement of all Colonial Claims. Count Hertling leaves it to England to determine how she will come to terms with America on. this proposal. The Germans will have to talk on. the subject &quot;at the time of tire reconstruction of the colonial possessions of the world,&quot; which, they have-&quot; demanded unconditionally.&quot;(6) Evacuation of Russian Territory. &quot; Alone concerns Russia and the four Allied. Powers &quot; (Central Powers).(7) The Belgian Question. &quot;i must decline any discussion until the general discussion takes place.&quot;(8) Liberation of French Territory. &quot;Conditions and modalities of the &quot; evacuation, which must take into consideration (lie vital interests of Germany, &quot;must be agreed between Germany and. France.&quot; &quot;We will never permit ourselves to be robbed of Alsace-Lorraine by our enemies.&quot;(9 to 11). Italian Frontiers, Nationalities of Danube Monarchy, and, the Balkan States. These are questions of paramount importance to Austria-Hungary, to whose Foreign Minister the reply to President Wilson is left &quot; in the first instance.&quot;(12) Turkey. Count Hertling does not propose to forestall the attitude of Turkish statesmen. &quot;The integrity of Turkey and the security of her capital, &quot; which is closely connected with the questions of the Straits, are important &quot; and vital interests also of the German Empire. Our Ally can in this respect-&quot; always rely on our most explicit assistance.&quot;(13) Poland. -&quot;It must be left to Germany and Austria-Hungary and Poland to come to an agreement.&quot;(14) A. League of Nations. &quot; .1. am sympathetic,&quot; and the Imperial German Government is ready &quot; to investigate the principles of such a national union &quot; but only &quot; after all the other questions in suspense have been settled.&quot;Peroration. In his peroration, as in the speech itself/Count Hertling relied upon a military victory over the Entente Powers and assumed the same attitude towards them, that the German delegates assumed towards the Bolshevists at Brest-Litovsk after the collapse of the Russian armies. He appealed for unity in the nation to bring-about victorv for the German arms.G. G. A.January 31st, 1918.
