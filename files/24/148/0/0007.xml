SECRET.APPRECIATION  UP THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERALREPORT No. 56.paet ii. foreign and general.Peace Discussions.The peace discussions conducted by the Bolshevists with the Central Powers have now led to, a situation which cannot, at the present stage, be &quot; appreciated.&quot; It can best be described as Gilbertiau. It seems clear that the Germans dominated the Brest-Litovsk Conference. Their policy has been guided by military considera-tious, and they have answered arguments by action, a course offering the best prospect of military success in time of war. On the other hand, they have been forced to disclose their true war aims military conquest, with a view to obtaining economic advantages in conquered countries. It remains to be seen whether the German, Austro-H.ungar.ian, Turkish, and Bulgarian, peoples and armies are prepared to support this policy, now that the. &quot; encirclement &quot; and &quot; Defence of the Fatherland &quot; myths have been exploded. On the opening of the Reichstag, the Vice-President tried, to make capital out of having made peace with the Ukraine without demanding annexations of territory or indemnities, but omits to mention that no military conquest of the Ukraine by Germany could be claimed, or that the Ukrainians were bribed with part of Poland. In the Baltic provinces, occupied, by German troops, the peace terms the Germans were prepared to grant amounted to annexation based, avowedly upon conquest. [In this connection, a recent report of the Intelligence Bureau, upon Esthonia, Livonia, and courland is helpful in studying the difficulty of applying the principle of &quot; self-determination&quot; based on nationality.]To review briefly the result of the Brest negotiations. The Central Powers made peace with an independent Ukraine (financed by France?). The Bolshevists, after having acknowledged Ukrainian independence, withdrew their acknowledgment, and raised what appears to have been a successful revolution in the country. Claiming to speak for a Russian Federated Republic, the Bolshevists then declared that they were no longer at war with the Central Powers, but would not sign the terms of peace, based by the Germans purely upon force. The Germans then undertook immediate military operations, and. the Bolshevists, having destroyed their own army, were forced to accept the German terms. A barrage of words lias so far proved in time of war to be an ineffective defence against an invading army.A. review of -President Wilsons latest speech, is given in an Appendix. The effect upon the solidarity of the Central Power Alliance of his direct appeal to Count Czernin will be awaited with interest. M. Trotsky has also appealed personally to Count Czernin by wireless.Attention is drawn to M. Trotsky&apos;s accusation against Great Britain of imperialistic Avar aims.   In view of the influence of similar propaganda in. our own and Allied
countries, it may be thought desirable to meet the accusation publicly.

PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Fai- Fast. Lord Reading reports that the United States Government is still opposed to foreign intervention in Russian affairs, and continues to believe that a change for the better may be brought about without such intervention. Should circumstances ultimately necessitate military measures in Siberia, international co-operation would, in the view of the State Department, be preferable to sole action by one Power under mandate from the others. Alternatively, Japan might be left to intervene on her own initiative at Vladivostock, and. the Allies and America might reserve their representations until this happened. Sir R. Rodd learns that the Italian Government is now prepared to approve a mandate to Japan, conditional on the prior consent of the United States Government. Sir G. Greene learns that the Japanese Government is anxious to know- the attitude of the Entente Powers in regard to the apparent defection of Russia as a signatory of the Declaration of London. Sir J. Jordan learns that emissaries from Lenin to Tokio and Peking have been captured in Manchuria. The Foreign Office is informed that in the Tomsk district 20,000 German and Austrian prisoners have been armed and organised in anticipation of a possible Japanese invasion. Others are being mobilised at Omsk, Harbin, Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk ; 157 waggon-loads of provisions and leather goods have already been despatched, from Krasnoyarsk to Germany, and raw materials are being collected at Omsk presumably for the same destination. Sir H. Rumbold reports German economic designs upon Russia,.aimed at post-war exclusion of the Allies. Mr. Lindley believes that the whole situation is the result of German intrigues, and that unless immediate steps are taken the Allies must sacrifice their interests in Siberia. The French Government expresses a similar conviction. Meanwhile His Majesty&apos;s. Consul at Vladivostock emphasises the value of the independent guerilla operations carried out by Captain Semenov, who holds the junction of the Amur and Chinese Eastern Railways. The further success of these might- obviate the necessity for Foreign military intervention.War Purchases and Finance. Mr. Crosby, Chairman of the Interallied Council, has pointed out to the Ministry of Munitions the desirability of a better correlation of Allied applications to the United States Government. He suggests that lists should be supplied of material, whether actually on baud in England, France or Italy, or awaiting shipment from, the United States to the order of any one of those countries. It may thus be found possible to satisfy the immediate requirements of the one out of stocks at the disposal of the other ; and in this way a waste of money, tonnage and time will be avoided. His Majesty&apos;s Government has instructed its relative Depart-ments in this sense.Jews and the War. Lord Reading learns that a stimulus would, be given to Jewish recruiting and pro-British sentiment amongst American Jews if the Jewish Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment were to be employed in Palestine.Black Lists. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading to put forward proposals for an agreed Interallied Black List, and a policy of mutual consultation in regard to cases not included in such list.Allied Socialist Conference. The Allied Socialist Conference began its sittings in London, on. February 20th. Sir R. Rodd reports that the Italian official Socialist delegates to the Conference are accompanied by a number of interventionists, whose influence will operate to counteract that of the pacifist elements.FRANCE.Bolo. -Lord Bertie reports that on February 14th Bolo w:as found guilty and condemned to death. The Intelligence Bureau notices the curious light thrown by the case upon present political conditions in France, under which friendship and
apparently even favour liave been shown to an obvious adventurer by responsible   -officials.   The condemnation of Bolo will have a good effect upon the Army, the spirit of which has recently very much improved.Humbert. Lord Bertie reports the arrest on. February 18th. of Senator Humbert.Defaitisme. The Intelligence Bureau reports that Pacifist agitation, possibly of foreign origin, has been, discovered at Lyons, where 13 persons, engaged in the dissemination of leaflets, have been arrested. At the recent meeting of the Socialists of the Confederation, of the Seine,jbe Pacifist Minority defeated the Majority, and secured seven delegates for the forthcoming National Socialist Council as against three secured by the Majority and two by the extreme, or Kienthal, section. The victorious party in their motion declared against further support of votes of credit for the war, opposed any participation in the Government, and called, upon the three Socialists who. now hold minor and non-political posts to resign. Such symptoms point to the possibility of an ultimate cleavage between men like M. Albert Thomas and M. Varenne, who really believe in the union of the nation and the prosecution -of the war till victory is attained, and the Pacifist section who do not honestly believe in either. Meanwhile, an article by M. Thomas in Humanite shows him to be still -critical of the internal administration and external policy of the Government.ITALY.Oats. Lord. Bertie reports that the French Government is unable to contribute to the Italian oat supply as proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government (see Report No. 52). His Majesty&apos;s Government has authorised the diversion of certain vessels to the purpose.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Austrian Relations witli Germany. The Kolnisclie Volkszeitung reproduces an article by Professor Sieger, protesting at the tone of the Austrian. Press against the German Alliance. He states that this tone is becoming more accentuated, and that it is noticeable not only in the Press, but in the streets and trams-representing the policy of Berlin as self-seeking and crafty. The resumption by Germany of hostilities against Russia is violently criticised by the Arbeiter Zeitung. Mr. Bagge learns of dissension, in the matter between the Central Powers. It is stated that the Austrians refuse, but the Hungarians are ready, to fight. It is rumoured, however, that the Austrians are about to occupy Ivieff, and that they have an understanding with Rumania.Austrian Food Supply. Sir II. Rum bold learns that the facilities hitherto allowed to the Corps Diplomatique at Vienna for procuring supplies have now been reduced by one-half. Mr. Bagge learns that the Austrians, having lost prestige by signing peace with Ukraine on the day (February 8th) of the fall of Kiel!, may be obliged to resort to an offensive against the Bolshevists in order to enforce the treaty. (This position may perhaps have been, modified, by Trot sky V: latest overtures. (See also under &quot;German Internal Affairs.&quot;)GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Propaganda. Sir R. Paget learns that&apos;in a report recently read to the Reichstag Committee a German General alleged that owing to the highhandedness of the British troops they were much disliked both in France and Italy. The French were demoralised and likely to collapse like the Russians. The British were shooting-Italian deserters, and ready to shoot French soldiers if they wavered. Such statements appear to exemplify the general lines of German propaganda in Italy and France. A similar propaganda composed of &quot;telling&quot; extracts from the Allied Press is being-issued in Russia by wireless addressed &quot;For Petrograd.&quot; Sir II. Rumbold learns that the Germans are well satisfied with the success of their propaganda in France, and think they have most successfully encouraged the belief that France is bleeding to death for Great Britain. &apos; In Switzerland they have chosen a very different form -of propaganda.   A short time ago some bombs of undoubtedly French make were
dropped at Ivallnach, within Swiss territory: It is well known, - however, that the-Swiss military authorities are inclined to suspect that, although the bombs were-French, they were dropped by German airmen. Careful investigations -into the question are now in progress. Sir W. Townley reports the Kdlnische Volkszcitimg as claiming to expose an Entente propaganda, arrived at bringing about the fall of Ludendorif, with the idea that Hidden burg would resign when deprived- of his support. (The idea, perhaps, is to suggest that such a desire could, only originate outside; Germany.)Supplies. The Frankfurter Zeitung announces that the Central -Powers are reckoning-upon speedy peace with. Rumania, which is of the utmost importance for the transport of supplies from. Ukrainia. But in any case, as the Intelligence Bureau points out, there-is not, in the first place, so much agricultural produce in Ukrainia as was originally believed, and secondly, the landlords and peasants are very reluctant to sell it even to local buyers. They will not take money for it, because money cannot at present purchase what they want. They will only barter their produce for other commodities,, agricultural implements, clothing, tea, &amp;c. How soon the Germans may be able to-organise a traffic of this kind remains to be seen. It also remains to be seen whether the Bolshevists contemplate &quot; demobilisation&quot; as against the Ukraine.Annexation, Sir H. Rumbold, hi. a despatch dated February 2nd, reports the -view of a reliable informant that the argument between the Military Party and the Reichstag Majority, is. designed to mislead foreigners. The question is not really whether Poland, Comiand and Lithuania shall be annexed or not, but Avhether their annexation shall be military or economic ; whether they shall be occupied territories or buffer States. The Weser Zeitung shows considerable anxiety as to the possibility-of Bolshevist infection in Germany as the result of Trotsky&apos;s &quot; peculiar declaration of peace.&quot; It points to the present condition of Finland, and declares that Germany cannot in such circumstances permit any change in the -military situation on the Eastern front. Sir R. Paget learns that the latest German scheme is to occupy Reyal, and to organise a Baltic league of Estlaud, Courlaud, Li viand and Lithuania under the headship of Poland.German People and Revolution. Sir II. Rumbold reports the substance of an article by Jacob Bengler (an anti-Governmental German journalist), which appeared in the -Freie Zcitung of January 30th. The writer gives six reasons, independently of. their natural pusillanimity (attributable to Stare Socialism), which prevent a general strike by the German working classes. Three of these are economic. First, trade union funds are low, because no subscriptions come in from comrades in the trenches ; and owing to the present cost of living strike pay would have to be at least five times above the peace rate. Secondly, a strike would mean the cessation of unprecedented wages. Thirdly, a large part of these wages is locked up by employers in war loan this constitutes a strong inducement to keep the present Government in power until the borrowed money is paid back. To these three economic reasons may be added two of a political nature. First, the Social Democratic Party is split in two, and a great deal of energy which the Minority Socialists ought to reserve for denouncing the Government and the war is squandered in denouncing their brethren of the Majority wing. Secondly, the Majority Socialists sold their souls to the Government on-August 4th, 1914, and Scheidemann is not the sort of man to play the part of LiebknechFs prodigal son. Finally, the whole mechanism of German life is out of gear. There is nothing to eat, there are no coals, there is no transport, no public security or public morals. What does that mean in a State whose bones are law, whose blood is order, and whose flesh is discipline? And Bengler closes with the remark that in such a State no very heroic act of revolution is needed to bring the whole structure crashing to the ground.Prussian Franchise Bill. The Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung of February 15th in a leading article entitled &quot;Suffrage Reform&quot; declares that the close relations established between. Government and people during war are to be made permanent in peace. The new Suffrage Reform Bill is not the outcome of old demands, nor is the present decision to forward its passage associated with the recent strikes. It will, demand considerable sacrifice on the part of certain parties who have rendered unforgettable service to the Prussian State. The Government knows that these sacrifices cannot be spontaneously or light-heartedly conceded, but only as the result of a serious exchange of opinions.   This also must be borne in mind in those quarters
which have always demanded equal suffrage. The period fixed for the deliberation and passage of the Bill is determined by the fact that the first elections after the war will be voted on the new basis.HOLLAND.Transit of Ore to Germany. The Foreign Office instructs Sir W. Townley to make inquiries in regard to the large amounts of copper ore and lead ore which appear to have entered Holland in transit for Germain&apos; between November and February.Germany and Dutch Shipping. Sir YV. Townley learns that the German Government is demanding guarantees that Dutch vessels leaving Dutch ports for America shall return to Holland. In default of such assurances action tantamount, to a blockade of the Dutch coast is threatened.SWITZERLAND.Meat Exports to Germany. The Foreign Office calls the attention of the French, Italian and United States Governments to the large amounts of meat exported from Switzerland to Germany, and proposes that the exportation and transit of all meat to Switzerland from and through Allied territory shall be stopped, and a rationing scheme introduced.King Constant/tie. Lord Granville reports that the Swiss Government has admitted to the Greek Government the inconsistency of King Constantine&apos;s entourage with Swiss neutrality, and has undertaken in future to arrest and intern any German officer who may visit the ex-King.NORWAY.Norwegian-American Negotiations.  With, reference to the negotiations mentioned, in Report No. 55. tire War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that the United States Government has now made an offer which permits Norway to supply the Germans with specified quantities of calcium carbide, calcium, nitrate, ferro-silicon, iron ore, zinc, aluminium, felspar and certain other commodities. In spite of the importance to the Allies of Norwegian shipping and war material, this offer is regarded by Sir M. Find lay as conceding more than is necessary. He points out that German prestige has been increased, Norwegian assurance encouraged, and the friendly newspapers discredited. He urges that the final negotiations should be completed in London.SWEDEN.Coal. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that the Swedish State Railways are refusing or delaying goods intended for the United Kingdom. &quot; They demand compensation for such services in the form of coal, although Great Britain is already supplying them with 6,000 to 9,000 tons a week, and has offered to deliver more when &quot;the shipping agreement is concluded. The Foreign Office is protesting against this unfriendly action. The German deliveries of coal to Sweden are still very inadequate. It is believed that some of the German ships employed in this trade will shortly be diverted into trade with the Russian Baltic provinces, and that the Swedes will be required to fetch coal from Germany in their own vessels.Aland. Sir E. Howard reports that on February 12th alarming reports reached Stockholm of terrorism inaugurated by the Russian garrison in the Aland Islands.. The Swedish Government has sent an expedition to rescue distressed Swedish subjects, and the Bolshevist Commissary, At. Vorowski, has also gone to persuade the Russian soldiery to desist from violence and evacuate Aland. The Swedish Government is also making representations to Betrograd in the matter (see under &quot; Finland &quot;). A Press telegram, reports that a provisional agreement has been reached, under which the Russian soldiers and Finnish National Guards should leave simul-taneously on Swedish ships, the former to Reval and the latter to Northern Finland. The Foreign Office learns that it is possible that the Russian troops will in fact be interned in Sweden, and steps taken by the Swedish Government to secure Aland from further disturbance.And see tinder &quot; Shipping Situation.&quot;49S5-Sh H
GDENMARK.Danish Premier and the Socialists. The Intelligence Bureau reports that on February 10th the Danish Premier. M. Zahle, in opening the election campaign, observed that the Social Democrats throughout the world were carrying on a peace policy. He defended the Danish Socialists (not very convincingly; against the charge of pro-Germanism (see Reports Nos. 50 and 54). The elections are fixed for April 22nd, and the Radicals are likely to be forced into alliance with the Socialists. Syndicalist agitation has led to serious riots in Copenhagen.Denmark and the Rouble. The Intelligence Bureau reports a statement that. Danish Banks, acting on information from the Russian State Bank, are ceasing to quote the rouble on the Copenhagen Exchange. A (partial) repudiation of the debt would thus appear to be indicated.FINLAND.The Foreign Office learns that fighting and general disorder continue in Finland. The Petrograd District Staff has ordered each regiment of the garrison to send a hundred men to the assistance of .the Red Guard. The Swedish Government has requested the Russian Government to withdraw the Russian troops in Finland and Aland, and has pointed out that the Russian Government has recognised the inde-pendence of Finland and has ordered a general demobilisation on all fronts. Suggestions are being made at Stockholm that the Scandinavian countries should make joint representations at Petrograd or that Sweden should circularise various Powers with a view to concerted pressure. Social Democraten states that the Swedish Social Democratic Party has delegated Mr. Bohmer to propose Swedish Socialist mediation to the Finnish Socialists, and. that Mr. Moller, Secretary of the Party, will probably also proceed to BelsingfOrs. Mr. Bran ting, in reply to a suggestion by the Danish Socialist Party for an enquiry by a Scandinavian Socialist Commission, has proposed that Danish co-operation, though welcome, had. better be deferred until an armistice has been arranged. On February 1.1th. Mr. Candnegren, Correspondent of the Activist Ajtenhladct,. and hitherto one of the principal pro-German activists in Sweden, declared at a meeting that either Germany or Sweden must come to the rescue of law against disorder in Finland and Aland, and asked whether Sweden wished, to see Gentian cannon directed against her coasts. The only other alternative was a Bolshevist Finland in federation with Russia. It is rumoured in Stockholm that Germany is about to undertake naval action, in the Gulf of Finland. (The Intelligence Bureau points out that, as there is every likelihood of the Baltic becoming a German lake, it is improbable that Germany will look on with complacency at the establishment of a Bolshevist Government in Finland.) The danger of Bolshevist infection is already apparent both in Norway and Sweden. Agitation has begun at Trondhjem; and Sir E. Howard, suggests that the Swedish Government, if it permits the transit of arms to Finland, will probably make it conditional, upon despatch by sea, for fear of opposition from Socialist railwayiuen. The want of food in Finland is serious, and the British and United States Ministers recommend that cereals should be allowed to come forward from the United States via Narvik, consigned to; some; reliable person for distribution as advised by the Legations. The Official Press Bureau in Yasa announces that Mr. Sarrio has been appointed Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Swedish papers report are interview with the Finnish delegate, Dr. lljelt, in the Berliner Mittagszeitung stating that the Finnish Government intends to establish a Legation in Berlin and afterwards one in London.SPAIN.German Submarine Campaign. Sir A. Hard in go learns that the German Government, in replying to the Spanish protest regarding the torpedoing of the -steamship Giralda, suggests that the steamer was not bond fide engaged in the coasting trade, but that the mineral ostensibly consigned to Pasages was in fact destined for France. The German Government has notified the Spanish Government that any Spanish ship trading directly or indirectly with the Allies will be torpedoed. According to the Spanish Foreign Office the submarine which sank the steamship Csferino did not in fact enter Spanish waters as alleged by the Press.Arid see under &quot; Shipping Situation.&quot;
.        , r; -       . ..y   A&apos;A -:&quot;&apos;&apos;-:... &apos;      A &apos;Mchina.   &quot;      &apos;  -Wireless Installations. With reference to the representations (mentioned in Report No. .55) made by the Japanese to the Chinese Government relative to wireless installations in China, Sir J. Jordan reports that the Danish (Larsen) Contract was cancelled at his request, as having been made on behalf of a German Company in breach of the obligations of the Chinese -/Government to the Marconi Company. The Japanese Government is mistaken in alleging that any German wireless concession now exists in China, German competition having in fact been abandoned in March 1914.. Enemy Property. With regard to the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government (see Report No. 55) that enemy property in China should be liquidated, Sir J. Jordan reports that the Chinese Government seems inclined to . confine its action to sequestration.Tibetan Frontier. -The Foreign Office instructs Sir J. Jordan to request the Chinese,Government to forbid any aggressive action by Chinese troops on the Tibetan frontier (see Report No 54).SIAM.Enemy Aliens. The Foreign Office learns that all enemy subjects interned in Siam (numbering some 290 persons), with the exception of a few women, have now been deported to India.ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.Count Luxburg. Sir hi. Howard learns that Count Luxburg, lately German Minister to the Argentine Government, and certain, members of his staff are desirous of proceeding to Sweden * and that the Argentine Government has approached a Swedish steamship compa ny in the matter. The company has inquired the views of His A!ajesty&apos;s Government. It is pointed out by the Argentine Government that should Count Luxburg go to Spain, he would probably have to remain there till the end of the war.Railway Strike. Sir R. Tower reports that the railway situation has improved, and that the movement has not become general. Lord Reading learns that the Argentine Central Railway has made an urgent request to the United States for coal.URUGUAY.Uruguay and the Argentine. According to the Buenos Aires Press of February 16th, the President of the Argentine Republic has promised to assist the Uruguayan President in the event of an invasion of Uruguay by German Colonists in Southern Brazil.CHILE.Proposed Military Mission to Germany.  Lord, Reading learns that the Chilian Government has expressed, anxiety to attach some officers to German regiments. The United States Government has not encouraged this project. The Chilian Govern-ment may possibly apply to the French Government for&apos; the necessary travelling facilities, but Sir F. Stronge believes that the scheme will be abandoned.Mexico.Carranza and the Oilfields. The Foreign Office has received, and communicated to the United States Government, information proving that Carranza has come to an arrangement with enemy agents, who hope to effect, through his movement against Pelaez, the interruption of the oil supply. Mr. Cummins reports that with a single exception the Government commanders operating in the oil district are manifesting pro-German sympathies. Lord Reading learns that the Mexican. Ambassador has assured the State Department that the Mexican Government has no wish to destroy the oil wells or-impede their production. The United States Govern-ment still considers that Carranza does not intend to interfere with the oilfields, but that he merely wishes to establish his troops there in place of those of Pelaez, and to
obtain any financial or other advantage that may result from the situation. Negotia-tions are proceeding between the United States Government and Carrauza for the supply to Mexico of food and the advance of $5,000,000 to cover the issue of notes : these facilities are offered by way of a necessary economic adjustment, and do not signify any change of policy. Mr. Cummins reports that about 700 troops with their -officers have left Mexico City and joined the rebel forces. The garrison of the State of Puebla has also revolted.Mission to Japan. Sir C. Greene learns that the Japanese Foreign Office has intimated to the Mexican Mission (-see Reports Nos. 50 and 52) that they must not expect to lie able to secure arms or ammunition from Japan. The man Burns, who appears to have dissociated himself from the Mission, will be refused an exequatur to act as Mexican Consul at Yokohama, on the ground that he is persona, -non grata to a Power with which -Japan is co-operating in the war.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Death, of Sir C. Spring Eire. Sir C. Spring Bice died of heart failure, at Ottawa,, -on February 13th. ,The Catholic Question. The Foreign Office is advised of the importance of the Catholic cpiestion as affecting Anglo-American relations. German and Irish Catholics are united only in hatred of England. The Irish, however, do not wish to be tarred with the pitch of Germanism, or classed as bad Americans. They will not, however, break with Germanism so long as the Irish question is unsolved and the Allies appear to maintain an anti-papal, attitude. For the United States, Americanism is the best counter-agent; for England, some manifestation of a friendly attitude towards the Pope, together with a satisfactory issue of the Convention, and meanwhile a-fuller publicity for the Ulster point of view, recent beneficial legislation in Ireland, and the-general difficulties of the problem.Exports to Russia. Supplementary to the instructions sent to Mr. Barclay (see Report No &apos;&quot;)4i) regarding exports from the United States to Russia, the Foreign Office now advises Lord Reading that such proposed exports include railway material, agricultural implements and drugs, all of which, are likely to be useful, directly or indirectly, to the enemy. Having regard to the strong probability of German influence at-Petrograd and the inability of the Bolshevist Government in any case to give effect to guarantees, His Majesty&apos;s Government instructs Lord Reading to urge that this question should be regarded at least with the same caution as that of exports to the neutral neighbours of Germany. Sir C. Greene points out that in view of this attitude of the United States Government he has not yet felt able to press the Japanese Government to place an embargo on shipments to Russia.Military Service Convention. Lord Reading reports the signature (on February 18th) of the British ami Canadian Military Service Conventions.SHIPPING  SITUAT1.0N.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period. February 8th 14th, inclusive, was 59,405 tons gross, of which 37,526 were British, as compared with 112,189 tons gross, of which 76,634 were British, reported last week.Blockade. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports the virtual completion of arrangements by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States War Trade Board for joint supervision of American exports to the northern European neutrals. It is not yet decided whether, under the new system, the guarantees of neutral -associations, such as the Netherlands Overseas Trust, are to be accepted, or whether (as the United -Slates War Trade Board suggest) guarantees should be issued by a representative.of the Allied Bowers in the country of destination.Import of Foods!ii-ffs.--The Ministry of Shipping reports that, in. view of the urgency of food supplies, special arrangements are being made for priority in the shipment of cereals irom North America to Great Britain during the months of February and March. General instructions have also been - cabled throughout the world that in liner shipments, for this period, foodstuffs (particularly wheat, flour-
/find oil seeds) should he loaded, in, all :practicable cases in preference to other cargo, with, the exception of certain key commodities ifi.g., nitrates, sandbags, gunnies).United States of America and Tonnage.-Lord Reading reports .that the War Trade Board, in order to economise tonnage, contemplates, the prohibition of all imports except under licence, and also the prohibition of all. exports except under licence to all neutral destinations.Swedish-American Negotiations. The Foreign Office lias instructed. Lord Reading to urge the United States Government to undertake in its negotiations with Sweden to exempt Swedish, shipping from United States bunker , conditions, as this question threatens to;preiudice not only a final agreement, but the modus vivendi itself. The War Trade Board has consented not to apply them to any Swedish, ships trading in accordance with any shipping agreement to which the United States Government is a party.Goal for Spain. The Ministry of Shipping points out the exorbitant level to which Spanish freights have been forced up by Spanish competition. Spanish lead and pyrites are of great importance to the Allies, but coal has to be supplied for the mines. For this purpose it is felt to be more expedient to charter Spanish tonnage on market terms than to divert British or controlled neutral vessels from bunkering duties. It is also submitted that the Ministry of Munitions should be empowered, to arrange that the British interests in Spain whose products are essential to the conduct of the war may be enabled to charter Spanish ships for their requirements, under such financial guarantees as the circumstances of each case justify. Meanwhile the -Shipping Controller proposes to charter Spanish vessels if any are available, and to put down their cargoes under circumstances which will leave the coal available for the Rio Tinto Mines. It is expected that, as a result of the conclusion of the Commercial Agreement with Spain, more Spanish vessels will come to Great, Britain for coal. A certain number has already been requisitioned by the Spanish Govern-nient for the purpose. It is also rumoured that the Spanish Government is about to fix coal freights, and a considerable drop may therefore be anticipated.Shipping and Shipbuilding after the W/ir.-Important, representations are made in a report issued by the Board of Trade upon the position of the Shipping and Shipbuilding Industries after the War. Of five million odd tons net of shipping destroyed by the enemy up till August 1917, over three million were British. The efforts to overtake these losses by construction have so far been utterly inadequate. The contraction, and still more the Government control of British shipping, have led to the discouragement of many British firms and a very great in-crease in foreign competition. Unless British shipping is enabled at the outset of the period, of reconstruction, to take full advantage of the situation, it may definitely lose the ascendency which has been the keystone of the Empire and the condition of Great BritaiiFs industrial existence. A number of general recommendations are made, aimed at (I) freedom from the prejudicial effects of Government control; (2) priority for release of British vessels from war service ; (o) surrender of merchant shipping-belonging to or captured by the enemy ; (4) immediate preparations for a post-war annual programme of two million tons net minimum of merchant shipping; (5) relaxation of the stringency of the licensing system imposed by the British Ships Transfer Restriction Acts ; (6) an agreement by ail the Allies to restrict the transfer of vessels to German owners. Finally, the Report urges the closest consultation. betureen the Government and the industries at every stage of demobilisation, and the measures approved should be entrusted so far as possible to the industries themselves.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. Peace discussions between the Central Powers and. &quot; Russia,&quot; as represented by the Bolshevists at Brest-Litovsk, are now at an end. The armistice was closed by the Germans with only: 48 hours&apos; notice, and. military operations, on the lines predicted in former reports, are said to have been commenced both in the Baltic provinces in the northern sphere, and also to the southwards towards the Ukraine.   Reports on the Brest-Lilovsk discussions which have come in during the4985-31 C
spast week are too run.numerous.us and too voluminous for detailed treatment. The last phase was marked by an intense barrage of words&apos;, transmitted, by wireless from Petrograd and Berlin. A large proportion of the messages from Petrograd were sent ill the German language, and of those from Berlin in Russian, both being obviously intended as propaganda to reach the proletariat in the respective countries. On the war aims issue the Germans may be said to have had rather the worst of the exchange in the warfare of words, as their interpretation of &quot; no annexations &quot; appears to the rest of. the world to be the practical annexation by Germany of Courland, Livonia, and the Moon Islands. An advance by their armies into Esthonia will be interpreted as having a similar end in view : it will be difficult to explain such an operation as a measure adopted for the defeuce of a Fatherland in danger of invasion by &quot;encircling&quot; neighbours, or even to bring it into line with the Reichstag resolution of July 1917.   (Idle latest information is given below under &quot; Russia.&quot;)The latest speech by President Wilson to Congress on the principles for which the United States entered the war, and intend to see it through to a successful conclusion, .is of special interest in this connection. A- review of the speech is given in an Appendix to this Report. It is interesting to compare it with the Kaiseps birthday manifesto to the Reichstag, referred to in Western Report No. 53. The tone of that manifesto cleared up the situation by informing the whole world that the true German war aim is now to obtain economic advantages by military conquest. It can no longer be disguised under the cloak of-defence against imaginary aggression by encircling enemies.On the other hand, the Bolshevists have now shown clearly that their object is not really ;i vvorlchs peace, but the substitution of revolutionary class warfare, and a reign of terror, for a warfare of nations against the German, doctrine that States should advance their interests at the expense of other States by means of military force, uncontrolled by any considerations of honour- or moral obligation. There are parties in. Finland, in the Russian Baltic provinces, and in. the Ukraine, who are inclined to welcome the intervention even of German armies, as saviours of those wdio have anything to lose, against a reign of terror by revolutionary mobs.Special Bolshevist appeals against the alleged &quot;imperialistic&quot; war aims of Great Britain, require attention. In this connection it is interesting to recall the private statement by President Wilson to Sir G. Spring Rice (see Western. Report No. 52, page 13). Whether these appeals are likely to be responded to by any of the delegates to the conference now sitting in London of Socialists from countries of the Entente Alliance will be disclosed in due course. The Germans have provided useful propaganda by unmasking their true war aims, as described above.Peace discussions, as affecting separate countries, are dealt, with briefly under the appropriate headings, as far as it has been possible to deal with the mass of material in the time available. The attitude of Austria-Hungary in the near future will be of especial interest. It will be difficult for Count. Czernin to reconcile his public pro-nounceraents with a continued support of German aggressive war aims, and President Wilsoibs last appeal to him will be specially hard to answer.The Rumanian- armistice has been extended until February 22nd, apparently with some reluctance on the part of the German military representatives, whose &quot; sabre-rattling &quot; may drive the Rumanians to desperation. The Rumanian decision whether to continue the war after that date will have a very important effect upon German military operations in the-Ukraine, and upon the prospects of Germany obtaining the hoped for economic advantages. Foreign Office information at present points to the probability of Rumanians making a separate peace in the near future. Between the Bolshevists on the one hand, and the German army on the other, the Rumanians are in a difficult position.As regards other points raised by the Brest negotiations, Poland is so adversely affected by the terms of the peace made by the Central Powers with the Ukraine that much indignation has resulted, and far-reaching effects may be expected. Finland is in the throes of civil war. due whole situation is kaleidoscopic, and the principal point, that emerges is that Germany now has problems on. her hands that may strain her military resources to the utmost, and may make it impossible for the dominant military powers to rely for a much longer period on the support of the German people, of Austria-Hungary, of Turkey, and of Bulgaria, for their policy- of conquest. The effect of the slow pressure brought to bear by our sea power and the blockade policy is of importance in this connection. This subject is dealt with as an Appendix to Part I. of this weelcs Report.
On February 15th Mr. Lindlej&apos;- reported that the Turks and Bulgarians were in a very secondary position at Brest, and were not even present on ail occasions.On February 17th Sir VV. Townley reports on good authority the. commencement -of negotiations between Germany and Austria to regulate the commercial relations to be established under the peace treaty with the Ukraine.Socialist Congress in London. Sir lb Rodd on February 17th represented, on the authority of the Italian Foreign. Minister and the French. Ambassador in Borne, the -difficulty the Italian and French Governments are placed in with regard to Socialist congresses, if their object is to compel Governments to accept their peace conditions. Special objections would attach to any such congress being held at Berne because, of its situation near the German, frontier, and because of local German influence.The delegates to the London Conference have now assembled.&quot; Revolutionary &quot; Socialist Congress in Petrograd. Mr. Lindley on February 1-fth reported on a congress claiming to include representatives of Sweden, Norway, Great Britain, Poland, Lithuania, the Jugo-Slavs, and America. The meeting was held on February 9th.The Freedom of the Seas. This subject was treated in an Appendix to Part I. of the Western, and General Report, No. 52, where special attention, was drawn, to the effect on the invasion problem as affecting the United Kingdom, the Dominions, India, and British Colonies and Protectorates, which would result if President Wilson&apos;s formula were to be accepted. Only experts in naval strategy in its widest sense are competent to express an opinion about the effect of such -acceptance upon naval strategy and tactics. In an Appendix to this week&apos;s Report (Part T.) will be found extracts from a paper, recently drawn up in. the War Trade Intelligence Department, to indicate the effects our sea power has produced in this war by the blockade of enemy countries.Russia. The state of Avar, which M. Trotsky maintained at Brest on February 1 Oth to have ceased, may be considered to have been re-established by Germany from noon on February 18th, according to a declaration by the German military authorities, which was protested against by M. Trotsky in Russian Wireless of February 17th. On February .19th AI. Trotsky issued by wireless to the German Government a protest against German troops being directed, against the Russian Republic, and formally declared the willingness of the Bolshevists to sign a peace upon the conditions which had been dictated by the Quadruple Alliance at Brest-Li to vsk. On the same day Russian Wireless, signed by Krylenko, issued an appeal to &quot;Headquarters and to all fronts &quot; that &quot; massed pourparlers &quot; should be organised with the German soldiers, and proposals made to them to refrain from fighting. &quot;If the Germans refuse, then you must offer to them, every possible resistance.&quot; On the same&apos; day Russian Wireless issued a special personal, appeal to Count Czernin, announcing the circumstances, and asking whether he considers the Austro-Hungarians as being in a state of war with Russia.The Foreign Office has received very reliable information dated February..15th proving that M. Trotsky tried, all he could to make things as difficult as possible for the Germans at Brest. There appears to be no doubt about the authenticity, or -about his extreme annoyance at the attitude assumed by the Ukraine Rada Govern-merit. In everything the Bolshevists did they never, forgot their ideal, which is to bring about revolutions in every country. Trotsky is undoubtedly furious with the Germans at present, and this fact may influence his policy.M. Trotsky arrived at Petrograd from Brest early on February 13th. His latest speech, as reported by Air. Lindley on February .17th, ends with the words : &quot;Universal revolution revolt of the proletariat of Western Europe and America will break and annihilate this coiispirae3&apos;&apos;&quot; (of what he calls universal Imperialism) &quot; and set the world free for ever from conspiracies of oppressors against oppressed.&quot;The Foreign Office learns on good information (February 16th) that AI. Trotsky is ready to discourage revolutionary propaganda in England in return for a similar undertaking on our behalf in regard to support of the counter-revolutionists i&quot; Russia.Ukraine. Air. Lindley on February 15th. reported that he had taken steps to -convey to M. Trotsky information that the British Government has not recognised
the independence either oO the Ukraine or ol! any other portion of the former empire-of Russia: The Foreign Office on February 16th told Mr. Lindley that Great Britain, France, and Italy were unable to recognise, the peace established between the Central Powers and the Ukraine and Mr. Bagge had been so informed. According-to German Wireless of February - .17th the Ukraine (Rada) delegation at Brest has appealed to the German nation for help for the Ukraine nation against the Bolshevists, who &quot;have now, as they say,- begun a holy war against the Ukraine Socialists.&quot;[The Ukraine Government left Kiel! during the night of February 7th, according to Foreign office information.]Hsbhonia. -Sir E. Howard on February 12th reported that a member of the Esthonian Diet, claiming to be an authorised representative, called at the Embassy to-hand in a written protest against a petition, oil the Esthonian nobility to the German Government for armed protection. Until the Esthonian Constituent Assembly meets on February 28th, the Diet is represented to be the only legal embodiment of the opinion of the Esthonian people. The nobility are stated to represent only 5 per cent, of the population, namely, the German element. The member was told in reply that the British Government sympathises, with the principle of self-determination for the Baltic peoples.German Wireless of February .17th claims that the majority of the Esthonians are pro-German.Kamania. German Wireless  of February .13th denies the I.lavas  report  that. Germany had issued an ultimatum to Rumania, but adds that &quot; it is true that General &quot; Field-Marshal Mackenseii entered   into   negotiations with  the Rumanian Army &quot; administration in order to bring about a decision concerning the continuation of the-&quot; armistice, &amp;c.&quot;German Wireless of the same date states that the delegation from the Dobrudja would shortly arrive in Vienna and Berlin to submit a memorandum asking for the union of the Dobrudja with Bulgaria.The Foreign Office on February 13th informed Sir G. Barclay that the French Government have confirmed all previous instructions regarding the non-conclusion of a separate peace by Rumania, or even of negotiations for this purpose. The Foreign Office added certain assurances which the British Government is prepared to give to Rumania (1) to continue an energetic military action on the hostile fronts, and (2) to endeavour to settle the conflict between Rumania and the Bolshevists.Lord Bertie on. February 16th sends information, derived from official sources at Jassy, dated February 15th, to the effect that in the opinion, of the Prime Minister, the people of Rumania would not see their way to any other Course but the conclusion of peace. In negotiations on the prolongation of the armistice, the Germans have reluctantly agreed to prolong it until the 22nd of February, and it is probable that they have only taken this course on account of instructions received, from Berlin,Sir IT. Rumbohl reports on the same date, on good authority, that the conditions, offered by the Central Powers to Rumania are :  Rectification of frontiers, favouring Austria.Economic dependence on the Central Powers.Rumania to take Bessarabia, giving the Dobrudja to Bulgaria.The second son of the present King to be King.[Sir G. Barclay reports on February 11th that a complaint has been sent to the Entente Allied countries, deprecating any unfriendly Press comments or manifestations of indignation on account of approaching peace negotiations.]Finland. The situation is dealt with elsewhere in this Report.Germany. Sir W. Townley on February .1.1th reported a speech by the Kaiser to about 5,000 inhabitants of Hamburg, proclaiming his adhesion to annexationism and his objection to peace by agreementGerman Wireless of February 14th publishes a special German Ukraine Treaty Supplementary to the Peace Treaty made by Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey on the one side, and the Ukraine on the other side. The Treaty provides for the reciprocal return of all merchant vessels and cargoes, which is obviously a. good bargain for Germany.
IdSir R. Paget on February 16th reported that the last German intentions are to seize Reval and to form a league of the Baltic Provinces, to be led by Poland.Sir W. Townley on February 16th reported on good authority that Germany intends to extend her territory still further at Russia&apos;s expense, and hopes to re-establish the Romanoff dynasty. There are indications in the Vorwartz that the authorities are trying to prepare social democracies for some such development. Sir W. Townley further reports on the same date an official announcement that conferences at German headquarters have resulted in a-&apos;-decision being taken that the Russian declaration of peace shall in no way affect the full liberty of germany action, and-that her Allies have agreed that, in the event of Germany resuming her military activities, the attitude of Austria will not be influenced by such action.Sir 11. Rum bold on February I6th sent an account of recent conferences in Berlin, attended by the Grand Vizier and other Turks, at which steps were con-si dered which would ensure the maintenance of German influence after the conclusion of &quot;the war. A proposal for navigation of the Black Sea was discussed at Bremen and at Hamburg, including the establishment of a shipping company controlled, and financed by Germans.Austria-Hungary, The Intelligence Bureau on February 11th state that there is more and more open comment especially in the Socialist Press upon Germany&apos;s interpretation of &quot; no annexations.&quot; If Count Czerniu&apos;s repeated applications of the phrase have any meaning whatever, he ought, the plain man argues, to have no difficulty in coming to terms with Trotsky, who, more than anyone else, stands for this principle. Count Czernin&apos;s own Press organs treat as the central point of his speech on war aims his suggestion that an exchange of ideas between Austria-Hungary and . America might form the starting point for a general discussion.Russian Wireless of February 12th stated, on the authority of a report from Vienna, that the Austrian Poles Club had broken off relations with the Austrian Government on account of the cession of the Cholm region to the Ukrainian Rep ublic.Sir II. Rumbold reported on February 15th on very good authority that the Austrians are not very hopeful, about the peace concluded with the Ukrainians, which was only established in order to afford encouragement to the public.On February 16th, Sir W. Townley reported, on good authority that there are acute difficulties between Austria and Germany about Poland, and that the Austrians believe that the Germans encouraged the Ukrainians to demand the Cholm district.Sir W. Townley has received evidence which throws doubt on the possibility of Austria making peace separately with, the Entente Alliance, even if she broke off completely with Germany, because of the demands that the Entente would probably make about Jugo-Slavs and. others. Sir W. Townley reports further (February 19th) his opinion that Austria is determined not to take part in hostilities in the East.France. Lord Bertie on February 12th reports that the principal Press organisations in France deplore what they call the Bolshevist resolutions passed by the Socialist Revolutionaries on February 10th.On the same day Lord. Bertie reports an article by M. Cachin in Ilumaniie criticising French diplomacy for making deplorable mistakes in the recognition of FinlanxPs independence, and in espousing the cause of the Ukraine, which has made peace separately. -On February 18th. he sends an account of the proceedings of the Nationalist Socialist Council of February 17th.   These have now been reported in the Press.Italy. -Sir R. Rodd in a despatch dated January 29th, gave a more hopeful account of the situation created in Italy by recent speeches of British statesmen on war aims.Sir R. Rodd on February 13th reported on the Socialist delegation to the London Conference, and, on February 15th he reported on good authority that Mr. Henderson&apos;s invitation to attend the Conference showed that it was being assembled in order to press Governments, and oblige them to consider the conclusion of peace.United States. Lord Reading on February 16th reported that he had heard President Wilsohs latest speech on war aims. The passages which elicited most applause were those indicating that the United States were determined to go on with fire war.   The reason why the President made this speech had not been disclosed,4-985 - Rb n
and there is some discussion, in the Press about the difference between President Wilson&apos;s views and those of the British Government on the speech made by Count Czernin.President Wilson&apos;&apos;s speech, according to an extract from the West falische sent by Sir W. . Townley on February 17th, has exasperated that paper into calling the President a poison-mixer, and other epithets, such as shameless liar. A review of the speech is given in an Appendix to this Report.Sioeden. Sir H. Howard on February 14th reported that the Swedish Government-has sent a protest to Petrograd against the continued presence of Russian troops in Finland and Aland.Great Britain. Bolshevist Propaganda. Russian Wireless of February 12th publishes a manifesto, from, the Alexandrovsk Council of Deputies, from the working men of Russia to the proletariats of all countries stating that on February 7th their greetings were sent to the English, German and Austrian, proletariats &quot; for their revolutionary struggle for a lasting democratic peace.&quot;On the same date, Mr. Lindloy was informed by the Foreign Office that the British Government is not prepared to permit Russians to engage themselves on political or revolutionary propaganda in Great Britain, and that Ml. Litvinoff had been informed in this sense.It is interesting to note a report, sent by Mr. Lindley on February 12th, of a speech by M. Trotsky at Brest on February 10th, in which he used-the words :--&quot; The war has long ceased to be for either party a Avar of defence-if, indeed, such &quot; was ever the case. When Great Britain has occupied African Colonies, Baghdad &quot; and Jerusalem, while Germany holds Serbia, Belgium, Poland, Ratvia and. &quot; Rumania, and is seizing the Moon Sound Islands, the -war can no longer be called &quot; defensive.&quot;&apos; GENERAL.Employment of Prisoners at the Front. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir W. Towhley to transmit through the Dutch authorities a protest to the German Govern-ment against the employment (and brutal ill-usage) of British prisoners within 30 kilometres of the front line, and the similar employment of non-commissioned officers, contrary to agreement, in manual labour.Prisoners at Ghangri. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir W. Townley to transmit through the Dutch authorities a protest to Constantinople in regard to the continued detention of British officer prisoners at Ohangri,.where conditions are very severe.Prisoners and Air Raids. The Dutch Minister in Berlin reports to The Hague that the German Government denies that British officers are interned in towns exposed to air raids.Exchange of Prisoners. In connection with the protest (mentioned in Report No. 55) made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the unsatisfactory performance by the German Government of the agreements for exchange and transfer of prisoners, the Foreign Office instructs Sir W. Townley to point out that over a specified period, during which the German Government undertook to transfer 2,300 officers and non-commissioned, officers to Holland, less than half that number have arrived there, and. that no incapacitated British combatants have been repatriated by the last two transports. His Majesty&apos;s Government will therefore send no more German combatants until the agreed number of British officers and non-commissioned officers have arrived in. Holland. With regard to civilians, only 378 have arrived in England instead of 459 as promised.
APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 56.  Part II.SPEECH DELIVERED BY PRESIDENT WILSON TO CONGRESS ON FEBRUARY 11th, 1918, AS REPORTED IN THE &quot; TIMES &quot; OP FEBRUARY 12th.[N.B. Lord, Reading had just arrived in the United States, and was present whenthe speech was delivered.&apos;]Introduction. President Wilson refers to his previous speech, of January 8th (see Appendix to Western and General Report No. 50, Part II.) to Air. Lloyd George&apos;s speech of January 5th (flrid), and to the speeches of Count Hertling (Report No. 53, Part IT.) and Count Czernin (No. 54, Part TP), both delivered on January 24th. After calling Count CzerniAs speech very friendly in tone, and describing as a misunderstanding Count CzerniAs alleged statement that, the President had received ;an intimation of the contents of the speech before it was delivered, he dealt with Count Hertling&apos;s speech, describing it as &apos;&apos; very vague and. very confusing,&quot; and &quot; apparently of an opposite purpose &quot; to that of Count Czernin. After taking Count 1-Iertiing&apos;s points in detail he says : &quot;After a settlement all round in. this fashion by &quot; individual barter and concession, he (Count Hertling) would have no objection to a &quot; League of Nations, which would undertake to hold the new balance of power steady &quot; against external disturbance.&quot; After exposing the meaning&apos; of Count Hertling s proposals, he asks, pertinently, &quot; Has he utterly forgotten the Reichstag&apos;s resolutions &quot; of the 19th July ? They spoke of the conditions of a general peace, not of national &quot;&quot; aggrandisement or of arrangements between State and State.&quot; The President adds especially his views on self-determination, which is &quot;not a mere phrase. It is an imperative principle of action which statesmen will henceforth ignore attheir peril.&quot;[In this connection it seems important to note the difficulties confronting all who use the expression &quot; self-determination,&quot; excepting as a mere phrase or catchword, unless they define their meaning more precisely. More especially whether they refer to self-determination by nationalities, by States, or by any other standard.]Attitude of the United Stales. &quot; The United States lias no desire to interfere in European affairs, or to act as arbiter in European territorial disputes. She would disdain to take advantage of any internal weakness or disorder to impose her own will upon another people. She is qiute ready to be shown that the settlements she has suggested are not the best or the most enduring. They are only her own provisional sketch of principles and. of the way in which they should be applied. But she entered this war because she was made a partner, whether she would or not, in the sufferings and indignities inflicted by the military masters of Germany against the peace and. security of mankind, and the conditions of peace will touch her as nearly as they will touch any other nation to which is entrusted a leading part in the maintenance of civilization. She cannot see her way to peace until the causes of this war are removed, its renewal rendered as nearly as may lie impossible.&quot;Count Herbling and Economic, Peace. &quot; Count von Hertling wants the essential, bases of commercial and industrial life to be safeguarded by common agreement and guarantee, but he cannot expect that to be conceded him if the other matters to be -determined by the articles of peace are not handled in the same way as items in the final accounting, lie cannot ask the benefit of common agreement in the one field without according it in the other. I take it for granted that he sees that separate and selfish compacts with regard to trade and the essential materials of manufacture would afford no foundation for peace. Neither, he may rest assured, will separate and selfish compacts with regard to provinces and peoples.&quot;[Since delivering his speech, President Wilson will doubtless have had his views of Count Hertling&apos;s pronouncements further illuminated by the Kaiser&apos;s birthday message to the Reichstag see Western Report No. 53, PartJL which amounts to a confession that the German war aims are simply to gain military victories in order to obtain economic advantages.]Count Czernin, in President WilsoAs opinion, &quot;seems to see the fundamental &quot; elements of peace with clear eyes and does not seek to obscure them .... Seeing &quot; and conceding, as he does, the essential principles involved and the necessity of &quot;&quot; candidly applying them, he naturally feels that Austria can respond to the purpose
&quot;of peace as expressed by the United States with less embarrassment than could.&apos; &quot; Germany. He would probably have gone much farther had it not been for.the. &quot; embarrassment of Austria&apos;s Alliances, and of her dependence upon Germany.&quot;[These are the words in the speech, which seem most directly to tend to wards-detaching Austria-Hungary from the alliance with Germany. From quotations sent in by Sir W. Townley (February 14th) and others from, the German press, it is clear that President Wilson! s words have caused some anxiety in that country. His speech has been received better by Austrian papers, especially the Arbeitcr Zeitung.]Poland. &quot; An independent Poland made up of all the indisputedly Polish, peoples who lie contiguous to one another is a matter of European concern and must, of course,, be conceded.&quot;Belgium. &quot; Must be evacuated and restored, no matter -what sacrifices and concessions that may involve.&quot;Subject Peoples in Austria-Hungary. President Wilson uses the words &quot;national &quot; aspirations must be satisfied even within his (Count Czernhbs) own Empire in the &quot; common interest of Europe and mankind.&quot;[It seems from this passage that President Wilson favours &quot; self-determination &quot; based, on nationality rather than on existing State boundaries. The unrestricted, acceptance of this theory would raise very wide issues in most countries in the world which include people whose national, sentiment is stronger than their patriotism based upon locality.]President Wilsons Principles. As a test of the sincerity of Germany and Austria-Hungary, the President put forward the following principles in order to ascertain. &quot; whether it is possible for either Government to go any farther in this comparison of views.&quot; ,&quot; Idle principles to be applied are these &quot;First, that each part of the final settlement must be based, upon the essential justice of that particular case and upon such adjustments as are most likely to bring a peace that will be permanent. -&quot; Second, that peoples and provinces are not to be bartered about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were mere chattels and pawns in a game, even the great game now for ever discredited of the balance of power ; but that,&quot;Third, every territorial settlement involved in this war must be made in the interest and for the benefit of the populations concerned, and not as a part of any mere adjustment or compromise of claims amongst rival States.&quot;Fourth, that ail well-defined national, aspirations shall be accorded,the utmost satisfaction that can be accorded them &quot;without introducing new or perpetuating old elements of discord and antagonism that would be likely in time to break the peace of Europe and, consequently, of the world. A,general, peace erected upon such founda-tions can be discussed. Until such a peace can be secured we have no choice but to goon. . . . We entered this war upon no small &apos; occasion, and. we can never turn, back from a. course chosen upon principle.&quot;&quot;The power of the United States is a menace to no nation or people, it will never be used in aggression or for the aggrandisement of any selfish, interests of our own.   It springs out of freedom and is for the service of freedom.&quot;[Idie general note of the speech is one of high idealism, of the establishment of principles, and of rigid adherence to such principles. President Wilson apparently did not announce his intention of making another war aim speech so soon after his last one, or his object in doing so, but from its general tone the speech appears to be intended to act as a &quot; philosopher&apos;3 stone&quot; to test wdi ether there is any truth in the wish expressed by the German rulers on the one band, and the Austrians on the other,, to bring about an enduring peace, based upon justice and not simply upon force. He draws a distinction between the sincerity displayed by Count Hertling and Count Czernin in this matter. Time alone will show whether the speech is likely to introduce a line of cleavage between the war aims of those enemy countries. His speech has raised organs in Germany like the Rheinische Westfdlische to fury, according to Sir W. Townley&apos;s report of February 17th. It is interesting now to recall (Western Report No. 54, Part II., page 5) the reports by the late Sir C. Spring-Rice on the importance of the adoption by ourselves and our allies of unselfish objects-in our own wrar aims.]G. G. A.February 20th, 19IS.
