PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.GENERAL.Allied Finance and Neutral Purchases. Lord Derby reports that the French. Government is prepared to take action similar to that adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government for discouraging Banks from assisting neutrals in the acquisition of essential commodities liable to embargo.   (See edso Reports Nos. G3 and 65.)Raw Materials. The French Government lias proposed an immediate Interallied Conference at Paris to consider the question, of the distribution of raw materials necessary for food and industry during the period, of reconstruction after the war. The French High Commissioner at Washington has been instructed to obtain the assent of the United States Government to this proposal. The Foreign Office has explained that an investigation is being made of the resources and requirements of the British Empire and that it would seem desirable to postpone the Conference till the Allies are fully informed of their respective needs. (See edso Reports Nos. 59, 61, and 64 under &quot; Allied Affairs.&quot;)Transport : Interallied Programme Committees.: Proposals are discussed in Memoranda G.T. 4559 and 4566 regarding the establishment of Interallied Programme Committees for examining the stocks, resources, and needs of each of the Allies with a view to a just distribution of supplies in accordance with tonnage facilities.Far Fast. -The alleged connivance of Allied representatives in Vladivostock and Peking at counter revolutionary projects has been made the subject of a protest by the Bolshevist Government. Sir 0. Greene learns that the Vladivostock Soviet has now expelled the Mayor and Municipality. This action has caused almost universal indignation, and organised opposition to the Bolshevists is increasing. Should this succeed, similar movements elsewhere would certainly be encouraged. Sir J. Jordan learns that a Provisional Government has been set up in the district occupied by Colonel Semenolfs force : it consists of Colonel Semenoff, General Shilnikoff, and M. Taskin, a member of the Constituent Assembly : the administration appears to be primarily of a military nature, but might become the nucleus of a regular Govern-ment. General Horvat, as Military Commandant of the Chinese Eastern Railway, has appointed Admiral Eolchak to the command of all present and future Russian militaiy forces operating in or despatched from the railway area. Admiral Eolchak is in touch with Semenoff. Sir C. G-reeue recommends the raising of the embargo to allow of supplies as far as the districts controlled by Semenoff.Sinkings. -According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing-ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period May 10th-16th inclusive, was 65,920 tons gross, of which 35,54.1 were British, as compared with 69,294, of which 53,832 were British, reported last week.Recently captured British Prisoners. According to reports received by Sir W. Townley from various sources, British prisoners recently captured are being employed immediately behind the line in very bad conditions. It is stated that they are seriously underfed and suffering from dysentery, and that the Dutch Commissioners are unable to inspect them. Ifepresentations have been made through the Netherlands Government.Reported prospective Italo-German Agreement for Exchange of Prisoners.  According to a Press report, the Italian Government contemplates an agreement with Germany regarding exchange of. prisoners, similar to that which was recently concluded by the French Government (see Reports Nos. 66-68), and which, as it involved extensive repatriation of fit combatants, was the subject of representations by Plis Afajesty&apos;s Government.
Franco-Turkish Agreement for Repatriation. The Foreign Office learns that the Franco-Turkish Agreement for repatriation of prisoners of war, signed at Berne on March 23rd, was ratified by the Turkish Government on May 7th. The Dutch Government: is enquiring of the Turkish Government whether facilities for the over-land journey will be granted by the Central Bowers. Simultaneously His Majesty&apos;s -Government is requested to allow free passage in the event of the maritime route from Scalauova being selected.Youthful Prisoners. The Foreign Office is, through the Netherlands-Authorities&apos; pressing the German Government for satisfactory assurances in regard to the treat-ment of youthful prisoners. Youthful German prisoners over 17 have received preferential treatment in Great Britain since October 1917.States in Alliance with Great Britain. The following revision should be made of -the Appendix to Report No. 51, as to the States at war with Germany and the date of commencement of hostilities in each case:- -Belgium, 3rd August 191.4. Serbia, 9th August .1914. Montenegro, 12th August 1914. Brazil, 26th October .1917. Guatemala, 23rd April 19.18.Nicaragua, 7th. May 1918 (date not officially confirmed).ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.Germany and Flanders. The Vossiehe Zeitung (April 13th) publishes some &quot;occasional notes on a studenfs journey&quot; in Belgium, by Otto Robolsky, of which the following may be quoted : &quot; The Flemish quest-ion is neither a German invention nor a German discovery. It is just as old as the Kingdom of Belgium, and rose with its establishment in 1830. The administrative border between Flanders and the Wallonia runs parallel with the linguistic border from west to east, i.e., horizontally -along the map. What, since 1830, lias been known as Belgium has been divided times innumerable in the course of the centuries, but always from north to south, i.e., vertically, and despite all the contrasts of race aud language. Even in 1830 the Flemings went hand in hand with the Walloons, and together threw out the Dutch. The highly developed Belgian industries rest only to a small degree upon raw material, produced at home. By far the greater part of the ore and coal has to be imported. The ore comes mainly from Longwy and Briey. hie who has them can exert a leverage over Belgian industries. The administrative separation of Flanders and Wallonia is demanded not only by the Flemish leaders. It is opposed by the legal, industrial, and clerical magnates. But even many Walloons desire this distinct cleavage ; so, e.g., the Socialistic Deputy, Jules Destree. In his letter to the King, Destree said : &quot; Would not a Belgium constituted, by the union of two peoples, independent and free, joined in harmony precisely because of this reciprocal independence, be a State infinitely stronger than a Belgium half of which believed itself to be oppressed by the other half?&quot; What are the goals and desires of the Flemish leaders ? The tendencies are very many and widely divergent. At one end -of the scale are the most radical, who want an independent Flanders, that would have not the slightest to do with the Walloons, rather would enter into a tariff and even a military union with Germany ; at the other end are those who are satisfied with an administrative separation, but feel themselves, so closely connected with Wallonia that they -wish to have the same constitutional head. The whole question is in the melting-pot, and is far from being ripe for settlement. Very many sentiments enter into the question.  - By the Flemings the  racial  relationship with Germany is
occasionally strongly emphasized. And among others one can repeatedly hear such sentiments as : we want this, that, and the other from Germany, and then we shall he ready to forget the wrong done to Belgium. General impression : The administrative separation is necessary and useful. Flemish policy must be pursued, but with that quiet love for actuality that characterises the German administr-ation in Belgium. The Flemish policy can only become dangerous if it is made into the German Party cry : &apos; The voice of the people ; the liberation of our oppressed brothers.&apos; But that, as it seems to us, is imminent.&quot; German Wireless of May 16th announces that as a result of recent successes, the Germans &quot; have been able to proceed with the repatriation of the Flemish population to their homes, in so far as these have not been destroyed. It is iudeed only possible to do so to a limited extent at the present moment. The British artillery has levelled too many villages and farms to the ground, even when they were not occupied by German troops. As the violence of the British bombardment usually prevented the escaping inhabitants from taking their possessions with them, they were destroyed afterwards by the enemy&apos;s artillery fire and by the fires it caused. The German Administration has therefore set to work with the greatest willingness to provide the returning exiles with the things they most urgently need.&quot;   (See also Reports Nos. 52, 54, 59 and 65.)BRAZIL.Commercial Position of Great Britain. In a Memorandum (E.O.C. SO), dated May 15th, the Foreign Office considers proposals for rectifying the commercial position of Great Britain (especialfy in regard to the coffee trade) in Brazil ; it is pointed out that the present predominance of German interests immediately affects British prestige and credit and threatens to monopolise a very important market after the war. Reports received by Plis Majesty&apos;s Government indicate that German trade and influence in Brazil can only be suppressed effectually by being supplanted.Goal. The Foreign Office learns that the Brazilian Government urgently requires coal for the continuance of manganese and other supplies to the Allies.CHINA.Sino-Japanesc Military Conver,tion.S\r J. Jordan reports the signature, subject to ratification, of a military agreement between China and Japan, stated to relate exclusively to co-operation with regard to Siberia. In the course of the negotiations the Chinese Government expressed its anxiety to limit such an agreement to the duration of the war, to obtain an undertaking from Japan for removal of military installations at its termination, and to define the common enemy as Germany and Austria. In the absence of a decision by the Allies to intervene in Siberia, the Chinese Government showed some hesitation in concluding the agreement, the alleged terms of which excited considerable popular apprehension as to Japanese intentions. Sir 0. Greene draws attention to the importance of considering in die light of this convention any allied invitation of Japanese intervention in Siberia. He adds that -the Japanese Foreign Minister has outlined to. him the motive, and scope of the agreement explaining it to be of a military rather than of a political character, and to have been misrepresented by the Chinese Press. The following Press telegram was sent from Washington on May 18th:-&quot; State Department officials acknowledge that official confirmation has now been received of an arrangement between the Entente -Powers and Japan and China for the preservation, of peace in the Far East and against German penetration there. The State Departments reports, it is understood, make it clear that the agreement entered into between Japan and China against German aggression in the Far East, is only for the period of the war,, and solely for protective purposes, being purely of a defensive nature. The Depart-merit does not believe that it directly concerns the United States, and consequently it involves no change in the Departments Far Eastern policy. This policy, it was said, might properly be subject to revision if in the future Japan, and China find it necessary to call upon the United States or the Entente for assistance in carrying out their
aspects of the.case, pointing&apos; out that the trial can scarcely fail to prejudice MM. Malvy and Caillaux, and to strengthen the hands of M. Clemenceau.   &quot; The whole business shows the importance attached by the Germans&apos; to getting at public opinion in the. Allied countries by means of the purchase of the bress.&quot;Call-up of Workmen. A communique issued to the Trench Press on Hay 1.5th states that Government in accordance, with the law voted to that effect will place at the disposal of the commander-in-Chief all mobilised workmen of the 1910, 1911 and 1912 classes, and some of those of classes from 1903 to 1909. Account will be taken of the time already passed at front, and, in considering possible, exceptions in special cases, of wounds received at front. The rumour is absolutely false which stated that mobilised workmen sent to the armies would be replaced by Americans. The com-munique recalls the declaration of Minister of Armament in Chamber, February 1st, to the effect that on no account and under no pretext whatever would any French workmen be replaced by workmen or soldiers of Allied armies. A delegation of Socialist Deputies comprising Thomas, Varenne, Reminded, Cachin and. hong net have obtained from the Minister of Armament an assurance that the rumour is false. The Minister has promised to make known all details of measures taken for equitable enforcement of the law in question.Labour Troubles. The Foreign Office is informed of labour unrest in the Lyons and Loire districts. Certain munition works in Paris have also been recently affected. The French Government is taking judicious action, and. it is hoped that the trouble will not be of long duration.ITALY.Ministerial Resignations. Signor E. Podd reports the resignations of the Ministers of Munitions (General DalF Olio) and Transports (Signor Bianchi). The functions of the former are assumed temporarily by the Minister of War (General Zupelli). The latter is succeeded by Senator Villa.   (And see Report No. 67.)Italian Industries. Italian Wireless of May 20th reports : Sr. Ciuffelii, Minister of industries and Commerce, in an important speech at Foligno, said :  &quot; The Government will find inexhaustible sources of new wealth in the National. Agriculture and Food Industries. The textile industries are developing, especially those home industries using hemp and silk. We are devoting to the maritime industries, and also to the metallurgical mining and chemical industries, a vast share of the energy which Italy has developed, during the war. Our attention has been specially directed to hydro-electric industries as a means of developing the potentiality of our plants. Our programme is to utilise systematically and completely all our water courses by creating large hydro basins and. collecting and distributing-electric energy, which may be capable of being utilised everywhere, thus saving the consumption of coal.   (And see Report No. 66.)Bolshevist Campaign. The Foreign Office informs Sir R. Rodd that Bolshevist emissaries in Sweden are carrying on an active propaganda in Italy, and that Italian Maximalists may be invited to make extreme demands of the Government under threat of refusal to support the war.&quot;The New Pact.&quot;- Italian Wireless of May 16th reports: &quot;Under the auspices of the Trente and Trieste Association a new Association, is being formed at Rome under the title of &apos; The New Pact.&apos; Thirty sections have been founded simultaneously throughout Italy which will form the nucleus of the Association. It aims at sanc-tioning a union between men belonging to the Italian middle class and working-masses and workers in the trenches to continue the war until victory.&quot;The Chigi Palace. Italian Wireless of May 16th reports: &quot;The Chigi Palace, formerly the seat of the Austrian Embassy to the Quirinal, to-day becomes State property.&quot;
MONTENEGRO.1 Uil11 and. Montenegro. The Italian Press reports that towards the end of April more than 150 deputies interpellated the Government, beseeching&apos; it not to forget the Montenegrins left to starve by Austria. The domicile d&apos;Italia of April 29th emphasises the importance of Montenegro for Italian foreign policy. It points out that up till now Italy has been alone in defending &quot; the historical rights of this our smallest Ally against the equivocal manoeuvres of so many enemies, declared or hidden, who for ends which cannot be avowed have not, hesitated to strike at this poor suffering people with the most infamous slanders. But to-day it seems that even those who were its chief opponents, the most audacious agitators, end by recognising the inexorable truth and bow before the clear facts. Trumbic has just, made the following declaration: &apos; With regard to Montenegro, I think that its independence and autonomy are historic and. ought to be respected. It will then depend on the - Montenegrin people to settle its own destiny after the war.; &quot;NICARAGUA,Declaration of War on Germany. The report of a declaration by Nicaragua of war against Germany and Austria-Hungary (sec, Report No. 08) is officially confirmed by Mr. Young, who received a telegram to that effect on May 10th from His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Managua, and. on May Pith from, the Nicaraguan Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom, he has conveyed the congratulations of His Majesty&apos;s Government,PORTUGAL.Allied Recognition of President Paes. Sir L. Carnegie reports that the Allied Ministers have notified the Portuguese Government of the formal recognition by their respective Governments of Senor Paes as President of the Portuguese Republic.New Ministry. Sir L. Carnegie reports that the President has constituted a new Administration, in which there is no Prime Minister, the various Ministers being entitled Secretaries of State for their respective Departments. Senor Espirito Santo Lima is appointed Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs. The Seculo (May 15) announces that the President has distributed the portfolios in the new Cabinet as. follows : - OsOrio Castro. Minister of Justice. Tamagnini Barboza. Minister of Interior. Espirito Santo Lima. Minister of Foreign Affairs. Navier Esteves. Minister of Finance.Captain Joacpiim Mendes Amaral. Minister of Commerce.Amilcar Motta.-Minister of War.dose Carlos de Maia.- Minister of Navy.Vasconcellos. Minister for the Colonies,Alfredo Magalhaes. Minister of Education.Henrique Forbes Bessa. Minister of Labour.Machado Santos. Minister of Food and Transport.Eduardo Fernandes Oliveira. Minister of Agriculture.UNITED STATES.United States War Effort. The Press reports an address given by Mr. W. C. Redfield, Secretary of Commerce in the United States Government, at the Canadian Club at Ottowa on May 20th. Mr. Redfield unfolded some of the achievements and plans of the United States. Thirty thousand factories, he said, were making muni-tions and equipment. There were now five plants, each larger than the Essen, works. He recently visited one factory where 30,000 men were making guns of all kinds, and 80,000 were on all kinds of war work. Fifty new ships would be constructed in June, more than 50 in July, and- still more in August. There were several yards which would, soon be able to build 50 ships at, one time through the assembling of pars. They had lent 1,152,600,0001 to the Allies. On May 1st they had greatly exceeded, their promise to have 500,000 men in France by July 1st. There were critics who related stories of failure.   He asked the country not to worry about the
reported failure of the American aeroplane factories. He saw one factory recently where the raw material was going in at one end and the finished product coming-out at the other. He also disputed the contention that the American railways had collapsed under the strain. They proposed to spend nearly 200,000,0001. on improve-ments, which included 100,000 freight cars.ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Attstro-German Pact.*-The Foreign Office is informed that the new Waffenhund (League of Arms) between Germany and Austria-Hungary provides for complete unity of the Austro-Germaii military and naval forces, effected by an exchange of liaison officers to the respective War Offices and General Staffs and the institution of a joint body responsible for the supreme control. Under this arrangement the relations between the armies will be identical with those existing between Prussia and Bavaria. There is also to be complete unity in the inter-national policy of the two empires under a joint council (representing both the Bundesrat and the Austrian Foreign Office) presided over by a nominee of the King of Bavaria. The economic part of the treaty will be settled by negotiations in Berlin ; the principles agreed on have as their object a Customs Union as against foreign countries, while allowing of protective duties between Germany and Austria ; it is also intended that German banking and industrial enterprises shall be accorded the status of indigenous ones in Austria-Hungary, and vice versa. The settlement of the Polish question is deferred until matters in the Ukraine have become more settled, but it is thought that the German Government is more reluctant than ever to approve any cut and dried scheme of Polish independence. With regard to the internal affairs of Austria-Hungary, Germany has agreedjto assist Austria in the suppression of any risings in Bohemia and. among the Southern Slavs, provided, that Austria maintains an unequivocally German domestic policy. The settlement of. general peace conditions is deferred till the return of the Emperor Charles from Sofia and Constantinople. The treaty, though initialled, has not yet been signed, and is not expected to come into immediate operation.German Wireless of May 21st reports : &quot;At an interview with the correspondent of the Neues Wiener Tagblalt, the Secretary of State of the Foreign Office,- von Kuhlmann, expressed the conviction that the principal resolutions taken during the Germano-Anstro-Hungarian negotiations would very soon lead to a speedy and favour-able agreement. The deepening and extension of the alliance should not by any means be considered as if it were a question of commencing to divide the world into two hostile halves, as some declarations from the Entente camp were endeavouring to make it appear. J ust as the Alliance of 1879 (the Dual Alliance), was the shield of European peace, so the new and deepened alliance would lay the foundation stone of a lasting peace of the peoples of the world. The German Ambassador in Vienna, Count Wedel, also declared in an interview given to the Vienna correspondent of the Prager Tageblatt: &apos; As the Germano-Austro-Hungarian alliance was the shield of peace for a generation, so will its extension and deepening (after the victorious ending-through our common efforts of the present -war of defenee) la)- the foundation stone for a general peace of nations lasting for generations. The fact that the events of the world war have not broken up the alliance, but have anchored it deeper and more securely, will also convince of their error the statesmen of the Entente who indulge in the senseless idea that they are able&apos;to drive a wedge between Germany and Austria-Hungary. The knowledge of the absolute unshakeableness of the alliance will, in conjunction with our military successes, tend to bring nearer the peace longed for by all of us.&apos; Vorwarbs of May 14th discusses the Conference as follows : &apos; The decisions-taken are of the greatest importance. The nature of the future relations between Germany and Austria will be decisive foroall Eastern questions, but it should not he forgotten that the general Beace Conference will have the final word. For this reason it is to be hoped that the Conference at&apos;Headquarters will not lead to premature settlements. The Socialist Party approves any alliance laying the foundation for a future league of nations, but will reject an alliance shutting itself off from the rest of the world with
0194hostility. No alliance rests on a firm foundation unless concluded with the glad -consent of the people, and at. present Germany is unpopular in Austria, not only with the Slav majority, hut also with a considerable part of the German and Magyar. Minority as the result of our Pan-German and reactionary policy. - Furthermore, -anxiety exists for the future of Austrian inclustibes. Attempts should, not be made to settle Eastern questions before the future relations between Germany and Austria are settled, ddie meeting gives the impression that it is a question to a great extent of dynastic interests, and that negotiations are taking place concerning the distribution of the Lithuanian, Courland, Esthoniari, Livonian and Polish thrones. Although these are questions immediately affecting the ruling families, the ultimate effect on the interests of the people is very great, and Monarchies erected on volcanic ground will probably become the starting point of new international conflicts, for which the peoples will again have to pay in blood, ddiis meeting can be useful only if an informal agreement has been reached on certain fundamental principles, hut attempts to force matters without the knowledge and wdll of the peoples might easily be fatal..&apos; &quot; ddie Frankfurter Zeitung of May 13th writes : &quot; ddie agreements in principle reached will be joyfully welcomed by the German people as an historical event of great importance, ddie cohesion of the two great Empires of Central Europe has become an absolute necessity to the German people ; whilst the agreements will be welcomed -with equal warmth by the G-eriuans in Austria and the Hungarians. Unfortunately it must be foreseen that the greater parts of the Slav nations in Austria, and especially the Czechs and Slovenes will be even more hostile as a result of this closer alliance with Germany than they are towards the present treaty. It will not be easy for Austrian and Hungarian statesmen to get the extended and deepened -alliance passed by the Lower House. There remains the possibility of winning the Poles by means of an Austrian solution of the Polish question with the union of Galicia to new Poland ; but none the less the new Central Europe will not be realised -without obstacles and struggles, but the necessities inherent in these things I are -strong enough to overcome obstacles, and when the war has ended by a peace which gives the Central Empires their rights, eveu opponents must see that the course of the world history cannot be held up by stubborn protests.&quot; A Vienna telegram to the Muneliener Neuste Nacliricht.cn says : &quot; ddie re-assembling -of the Reichsrat in the middle of June is dependent on the Poles, who, with the German parties, give the Government a working majority. The support of the Poles is conditional on the fulfilment of their three demands : the integrity of Congress Poland, the settlement of the Choliii question, and guarantees of the non-partition of Galicia.&quot;Austria and Hunga.ru. ddie Foreign Office is informed that, while food conditions in Hungary are comparatively easy, the Hungarians are preventing the export of supplies to Austria where conditions are extremely serious. From an Austrian source it is reported that the Hungarians are in favour of securing their present advantages by peace even at the expense of Austria and German,)&apos;. The Hungarian, troops are stated to show reluctance to fight further in Germany&apos;s battles.The Subject Peoples and the Austrian. Government. ddie Adenna Ncue Freie Presse of May 8th contains protests by the Czechs, Southern Slavs and Poles against the -adjournment of Parliament and the Austrian surrenders to the Germans, ddie joint protest, -which was issued after a joint meeting of the Czech League and the Southern Slav Club, contains the following passages : &quot; The deputies of the Czech, and Southern Slav peoples protest with the greatest indignation against all attempts by the Government to carry through, without the co-operation, of our peoples and against them, a reform of constitutional conditions which we have long outlived and which are not recognized by the peoples. d&apos;hey protest all the more vigorously, because what is being done is being done only by the setting up of district captaincies in Bohemia which has been forced upon the Government by German chauvinists. In the same way they protest against the separation of the Slovene countries from the indivisible Southern- Slav people of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and also against the German invasion which is to stretch to the Adriatic. They express their intense excite-ineht at the fact that the Government is doing all this in the most grievous moments of the world war, and that to their demands concerning the self-determination and political independence of their peoples demands which are those of the whole civilized ..and democratic world the Government replies by absolutist octrois, .which, instead of5681-4b &apos; C
making possible the friendly communion of the peoples, constituting the beginning of . struggles such as there have never been. We raise our voice against the revolting procedure of the Government, which, at a time when the principles of democracy, ,civil equality and automony of the peoples are penetrating the whole world, proceeds-against us with experiments which are really nothing but a fortification of absolutism, and a fresh increase of bureaucratic Imperialism. On the other hand, all the demands of onr peoples for complete civil, democratic automony in all representative bodies are deliberately passed over and intentionally ignored. With the same-determination we protest against the fact that, at a time when the Parliaments of all truly democratic States are taking part without interruption and in a decisive manner in the fate of theif^peoples, the Austrian Parliament is again adjourned without any reason, and the Deputies of our peoples are again, robbed of the right to speak in Parliament of which they had already during three years of the war been deprived under the pressure ot: the military dictatorship. The Government has once more proved to the whole world that Austria cannot be called a Constitutional State, and that an oligarchy, which is responsible to nobody, and a bureaucracy, which acts under the pressure of a part of the German Deputies, do not shrink from silencing the members of Parliament, as soon as they begin to fear that Parliament might have the courage to say openly, and to maintain, what is the real will and the actual conviction of the peoples represented in it.&quot; Italian Wireless of May 18th states :  The newspaper Slovenski Narocl commenting upon the resignation of the Slovene Minister Zolger, says : &quot; When it was thought possible to obtain peace by Wilson&apos;s aid,, the presence of a Jugo Slav in the Cabinet was important and useful for Austria. Those times have passed. Our compatriot&apos;s retirement teaches and convinces us that those Jugo Slavs who hope for help from Vienna are seriously mistaken. Any child can see that to-day the Germans with the Magyars are opposed to Jugo Slav independence. Let us thank God that this conviction makes itself clear at the decisive moment in a people&apos;s history. The decision depends upon us and not on Viennese ministerial authorities.&quot;Reported Nero Division of Bohemia. According to a Press report, the Vienna Official Gazette published on May 19th. a Ministerial Decree announcing the establishment of the following districts for Bohemia: Trautenau (270,000 inhabitants), Budweis (825,000), Caslau (359,000), Tabor (40-1,000),&apos; Pilsen (415,000), Pisek (417,000), Reicheuberg (520,000), Jiciu (528,000), Prague and environs (603,000), Eger (676,000), Konlggratz (701,000), and Leitmeritz. (782,000). &quot; These districts,&quot; the Decree adds, &quot; shall be administered by District Heads, with powers embodied, in the present Statthalter, who on his part will retain supreme power and supervision over all District Heads. The first self-adm. mistering districts, which shall come into being on January 1st 1919, shall be Leitmeritz and Prague. &quot;The Statthalter shall simultaneously be administrator of the Prague District. The remaining 10 districts shall be established successively, as mam- technical difficulties have to be overcome.&quot; The Decree further says : &quot;The danger to national minorities cannot arise from these regulations and prescriptions, as all general questions of rights and nationalities, and especially the language question, are not prejudiced by the establishment of districts.&quot; The authorities hope by this step to place upon a sound basis the political administration -of Bohemia.Food Situation in Galicia. -According to telegrams from Cracow published by the Neue Zilrcher Zeitung, the food situation in Galicia is desperate and people are dying of starvation. The Polish Socialist Deputies sent a telegram to Dr. von Seidler, the Austrian Premier, saying : &quot; For the last six weeks Galician towns have received no flour and no bread. We demand the immediate stopping of all requisitions of corn and cattle, the distribution of bread to the town population, and the opening of the frontier of the Kingdom of Poland to admit foodstuffs to Galicia. We reject all responsibility for the consequences of this starvation policy.&quot; Another telegram says that the people of Przemysl are starving. The Lublin newspapers state that the-Polish fugitives into Prussia are detained at Minsk by the German authorities,, who,, by refusing them food, compel them to go and work in Germany. The Warsaw papers publish similar statements.
GERMANY.German Trade and Finance. A report received describes the activity of the German Stock Exchange as very great indeed, nearly all. quotations being above those of the last liquidation of July 31st, 1914. The favourite objects of speculation are the shares of the steamship companies and the Russian banks. The shares of the Hamburg Amerika Line, which at the declaration of war by the United States sank to about 97 per cent., are now quoted at 135-140 per cent., almost their pre-war quotation. The shares of the other steamship companies are also very firm, largely owing to the official announcement that the Government would fully refund all damages suffered by the companies. It is also stated that the Government lias already requisitioned at favourable rates all German tonnage, in order to control imports after the war. The reason for the popularity of the Russian bank shares is to be found in the belief that (he German Government has obtained, special guarantees from the Russian Government, The Foreign Office is informed that the Germans are negotiating, for a lease of the Siberian Railway as far eastwards as Irkutsk. A report received states that numerous syndicates are centralised in Berlin, and financed by the great German banks which have now practically obtained exclusive control of the general trade. It appears that these monopolies have given rise to considerable jealousy amongst Hamburg merchants, whose influence has greatly diminished. Although the Government has given formal assurances that free trade would be re-established as soon as possible after the war, there is a general feeling of insecurity, and merchants of all lines of trade are creating associations to protect their interests. The sittings and. meetings of these associations are now occupying most of the time of the Hamburg merchants. The Kdlnische Zeitung of April 25th publishes a comparative account of the annual statements of the great German commercial banks for 1917. The report is analysed by the Daily Iieview of the Foreign Press (Economic Supplement) of May 14th.Germany and tlie Eastern Slates. -The Foreign Office is informed that the German Government, owing to the disorder at present prevailing in States newly created by it in Eastern Europe, intends, so soon as troops are available, to pursue a policy of extensive annexation. It is slated that Austria will, be given all that part of the Ukraine which lies west of the River Dnieper, and that. Germany will keep a--free hand with Poland, Lithuania and die Baltic States.The Ukraine. German Wireless of May 19th reports : &quot; The German Austro-Hungarian finance agreement with, the Ukraine was signed at Kieff on May 15th. The aim of the agreement is the restoration of Ukrainian money value with the help of a loan of -100,000,000 karbowanzi.&quot; The Swedish Press (May 14th) reports from Berlin Skoropadsky, 1 letmau of the Ukraine, makes the following statement :  lu full&apos; earnest and officially in the presence of the Premier, I invite the German Socialists to send three representatives to the Ukraine to see conditions there at close range and judge of the new tyrants of Europe. The Ukraine&apos;s adherence to Germany is in her own interest and will bring mutual advantages, there being no country from which Ukraine could derive more profit or has more to learn from. The. Ukraine is closely connected with Central Europe and the whole of Eastern Europe alike, and. must therefore grow strong and able to offer Germany support in every way.&quot; The Foreign Office learns that the Ukrainian peasants are refusing to work, as they believe that the corn will be requisitioned ; they are even destroying grain to prevent its removal The Kieff correspondent of the Russian newspaper Rannetitro describes the unfavourable terms upon which the Ukrainians are constrained to trade with the Germans. Apart from coal at 5 roubles 60 kopeks per pood, the Germans have nothing to offer, except a few agricultural machines at exorbitant prices, while the Ukraine is exporting to Germany textiles, metals, soap, sugar, lard, cattle, leather and paper.The Petroleum Peace. German. Press comment on the Rumanian peace emphasises its great economic importance for Germany. Several papers speak of &quot; a petroleum peace.&quot; The Frankfurter Zeitung (May 8th) points out that Germany is now independent of the United Slates for petroleum.
Black Sea Tonnage and Supplies for Central Powers. The following tonnage is reported to be available in the Black Sea : 1. ons.Allied steamers  - - - -    05,000Enemy steamers    - -&quot; - -   150,000Russian steamers      .       - - -   .1.65,000Rumanian steamers - - -    24,000Dutch steamers  - - - -     11,000Total - - -   415,000There are also two Russian oil tankers besides a considerable number of sailing vessels, especially along the Anatolian coast. This tonnage will have an important bearing on the question of the transport of Russian cereals and minerals to Austria and Germany. It has been announced that the route from the Black Sea ports to the Danube has been cleared of mines so that the sea route would appear to be open, but in spite of this fact it was officially stated that up to the end of April not more than 800 tons had been sent from the Ukraine over this route. The Danube route appears to be engaging the serious attention of the enemy. A Reichstag Deputy recently estimated that not more than 300,000 tons a month could be passed through the Iron Gates at Turmi-Severm. This was contradicted by the Hungarian Government who stated that the amount could be increased to 600,000 tons, or 20,000 tons a clay. To attain this end studies are being made for building a second channel through the Iron Gates so that the up-stream traffic could proceed continuously by clay aud night. At Baja, a railway junction further up the river in. Hungary, a large depot is being built to facilitate the distribution of cargo arriving by the Danube. German Wireless of May 20th reports that on the strength of an agreement between Germany and Austria-Hungary, Germany will receive a site for a new German shipyard above the Thurn-Severinar shipyards and within the region leased from Rumania.Discharged Soldiers.   The German Warrior Union and the Prussian National Warrior Society adopted at Whitsun a resolution in which it is stated : &quot;&apos; In future the Union -will accept an)&apos;- comrade, irrespective of his being a member of a political party, who swears allegiance to the Empire.&quot; Thereby the fight against Social Democracy disappears from the programme of the Union. At the same time the Union founded an extensive institution, the &quot;Imperial Warriors&apos; Bank,&quot; for the support of returning warriors, who have not been wounded, but who have been otherwise damaged through their participation in the war. Field Marshal Hindenburg and the Imperial Chancellor, Count Hertling, haA-e accepted the Honorary Chairmanship of the Institution (and see Reports Nos. 52, 57 and 59).The Leipzig Fair. According to a report received, the Leipzig Fair (see Reports Nos. 59 and 68) contained a fine and varied, assortment of exhibits, but the prices were on an average at 5 times their pre-war level, running in many instances to 10 or more times the previous cost. These prices were more than, double those prevailing at the time in the Scandinavian countries, and in the majority of cases the exhibitors were unable to give delivery until after the end of the Avar.Prussian Franchise Reform Bill.- A Berlin telegram (May I4fh) states that at the third reading of the Suffrage Bill to-day in the Prussian Lower House, the motion to restore paragraph IIP, providing for equal suffrage, Avas rejected by 236 Arotes to 188 (as on the second reading see Report No. 67).Defeat of Minority Socialist at By-election. A by-election was recently held at Zwickau in Saxony. The Majority Socialist obtained a striking victory over the Minority candidate, whose party had previously held the seat (c./., the Nieder Barnim election--Reports Nos. 59, 60, 62.)
NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.Sudden Departure of the President. Sir R. lower reports that the President of the Argentine Republic suddenly left Buenos Aires on the eve of the opening of Congress, and does not propose to return till June 6th. His absence would thus coincide with the proposed complimentary Adsit of the Special British Mission, and prominent Argentines express great anxiety lest it should, be slighted. According to a Press report, the Radical Senators marked their displeasure with the President-la absence by not attending the opening of Congress on May 16th. ddie Presidential Message, which consisted-chiefly of vague generalities, afforded no indications of a definite policy. The Message considers the -railway strikes to have been justified, a statement that cannot fail to attract attention, especially at the present juncture. Both the Nacion and the Prcnsa criticise the Message unfavourably, remarking that the Presidents failure to attend Congress was discourteous and ill-advised.Railway Strikes.- Sir R. Tower reports that the Argentine Minister of Public Works is now confident of a speech7 solution of the railway trouble. It is probable that the Argentine Government will, after all, decide against the reinstatement of the more refractory employes.Wheat.  Sir R, Tower reports that the Argentine Government has intimated its readiness to renew the Wheat Convention. The Foreign Office instructs Sir A. Idardinge that if Spanish purchases of cereals are made through the Wheat Commission (acting for the wheat Executive), firm prices can be cpioted for delivery f.o.b. Argentine, as owing to the Commission^ advantageous position in the market and extensive control of terminal and warehousing facilities the risk of delay and loss will be minimised. Sir W. Townley is instructed that the promised 50,000 tons of .South American wheat may similarly be contracted for with the Wheat Executive, ddie offer is also open to Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.CHILE. &apos;Elections. ddie result of the Elections to the Chamber of Deputies, which took place early in May, came as a surprise. It was expected that a Conservative majority would be returned, but, as a matter of fact, the Liberals now dominate the Chamber. This is a distinct set-back to the Germans, whose most influential supporters were to he found among the Conservatives- and their associates in the Church. The. notorious German-Chilian. League failed altogether, in spite of strenuous efforts, to influence the Elections. The society has evidently been much damaged by the recent exposures. Although the sympathies of the new Congress are pro-Entente, a neutral policy will probably be maintained.DENMARK.Exemptions from Embargo. The Foreign Office informs Sir R. Paget that by a decision of the Allied Blockade Committee the general embargo on Denmark is to be relaxed as from May 21st in respect of goods which are now free for Holland and Sweden.Iceland: German Propaganda. German Wireless of May 17th states: &quot;An Icelandic merchant who has just arrived in Copenhagen from Iceland gives the following account of present conditions in the island: &apos; ddie country is completely under the control of the British authorities, to whom the Danish as well as the Icelandic officials have to give way. England has bought up the whole catch of herrings at a price which means a heavy loss to the Icelanders. Icelanders who are going to Denmark are subjected, by order of the British, to a rigorous search, and are not allowed to take anj7 written document of any kind with them. The hatred against the British is very bitter in Iceland.&apos; &quot;   (And see Report No. 67).Protection of Scandinavian Interests. A Copenhagen message (May 14th) states that at the last meeting of the Scandinavian Ministers at Christiania it was decided,5081- 4b I)
as publicly announced, that measures should he taken, so far as Northern countries are concerned, for the protection of the common interests of neutral States during and after the war. &quot; The three Scandinavian Governments have appointed a committee to inquire into and deal, with the material in hand. The Committee is composed as follows: Denmark: The Foreign Minister, if. Zahle; Assistant Foreign Minister, M. Clan ; and a member of the Second Chamber, M. Nils Neergaard. Norway: the Minister in Stockholm, M. linger up ; the shipowner, M. Greig, and M. Lange.. Sweden : Baron Marks von Wurtemberg, Member of Parliament; Baron Adelswerd ; and M. Ewerloef, the late Chief Secretary of the Foreign Office. The committee is now meeting in Copenhagen.&quot;FINLAND.Incursion, of While Finns into Russian, Lapland. The Swedish evening Press of 16th. May publishes a telegram from. Kirkeness to a. Christiania newspaper stating that there has been a serious encounter between English and Russians on one side and Finnish White Guards on the other in the neighbourhood of Boris Gleb&apos; not far from Petehenga Estuary near the Russian Norwegian frontier, It is stated that the English and Russians surrounded a force of Linns, killing 50, who were on the march from EnareLake to take Petchenga, where there are reported to be 6,000 Russians and. 800 English. His Majesty&apos;s Vice Consul at Kirkeness reports to the same general effect. The Foreign Office learns that the Norwegian vessel Fritlijof is proceeding to Jarfjord to prevent the violation by the Finnish White Guard of Norwegian neutrality. The Norwegian Guardship Ran em is at Kirkeness, which is presently to be made a military depot with an establishment of from 300 to 500 soldiers. Sir E. Howard reports that, since the above encounter, the Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires in Stockholm has stated that the Finns had not attacked Russia in occupying the district referred to, this having been ceded by Russia to Finland in 1865 in exchange for territories on the frontier towards Petrograd ; the Charge d&apos;Affaires added that the rights of Finland to the district had been clearly recognised by the Bolshevist Government. Sir E. Howard has pointed out that, if this was so, it was to be regretted that the Finnish Government had not so advised the British authorities. The Finnish papers express great anxiety concerning events on the Murmaa coast.Finland, and Great Britain. Mr. Grove reports that the British offer of recognition has appeared, without comment in the Finnish Press. Subsequently the Dagens Press and Evening Independence contrast the free recognition by other Powers with the conditional offer of Great Britain: Hufvudstgdblad hopes that it will now be offered unconditionally. Stockholm newspapers of May 15th publish a telegram from Helsingfors, setting out a communique by the Senate respecting Great BritaiAs conditional recognition of FinlainFs independence. It states that, &quot; although), such acknowledgment would be of great value, there can be for us no question of Finland, whose national independence has already been acknowledged legally and practically by several Powers without any conditions whatsoever, being &quot;now willing to submit the question of her independence to any Congress. Concerning Great BritaiAs demands, it must be recalled that the Finnish Government has already on a previous occasion taken steps for setting free English and other Entente subjects imprisoned by the German military authorities in Finland, although Great Britain, who has not recognised Finland&apos;s national independence, has no legal ground for such a demand. The questions.of free passage by land and sea are raised too soon, since it is evident that international conditions of land and sea trade will for some time be such that exact regulations and. control will be unavoidable ; in such measure as conditions again become normal, hindrances for free traffic will automatically disappear.&apos;&quot; (The same telegram states that as Finland is not yet officially represented in Russia, she has appealed to Germany to protect Finnish subjects and interests there.) Sir E. Howard has expressed to the Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires a desire for a direct reply from the Wasa Government, observing.meanwhile that the British Government had not proposed that the question of Finnish independence should be submitted to the Peace Congress, but merely intimated that like all other questions arising from the war it would probably require explicit or implicit settlement at such a Congress. With regard to the arrest of British subjects, he has emphasized that the very fact of such arrest afforded an argument for non-recognition.   As to control of passengers
sand traffic, the right of the Finnish Government to make regulations would not he disputed; the British Government merely claimed equal rights with other States.&quot; Sir E. Howard learns that a principal cause of difficulty in the way of Finnish acceptance of. the offer is the delay of the Germans in complying with the Finnish Governments request for the release of British subjects arrested by the Germans. Mr. Grove reports that Finnish Banks are refusing to pay British subjects their -deposits, alleging that the British Government has placed an embargo on Finnish deposits in British Banks. The Foreign Office has informed him that this is not the case, though in view of the German occupation of Finland, money may not be transmitted there from the United Kingdom.Finland and Germany. Sir E. Howard reports that there is great friction in Finland between the Finnish and. Swedish parties; the former, supported by the pro-Germans, are working for the dismissal of General Alanuerheim, and his replace-raeiit by a German Commander-in-Chief. It is stated that the Finnish party propose to turn the Swedes out of Finland, with the result that it will become an advanced post of Germany under a German Prince.A. special envoy has been despatched to Berlin to request Germany to cancel the commercial treaty (see Report No. 68) and arrange a fresh one. The Germans have requested permission to buy 2,000 Finnish horses.Finnish Constitution. Sir E. Howard learns that M. Swinhufvud has been invested by the Diet with absolute powers (probably excepting the right to declare war). The newspapers report that in an interview M. Swinhufvud declared himself in favour of a monarchy for Finland as the best means of cementing good relatious with foreign Powers, adding that if a republic were adopted he and the generality of the present Senators would resign office. Finland&apos;s proposed new national flag would be white with a blue St. George&apos;s Cross ; in the quarter, a panelled red shield with a gold lion and gold stars according to the number of provinces.Finland and Russia. Mr.  Wood house reports (May 1-lth) that rumours   are -current in Petrograd that German-Finnish troops are preparing to occupy Petrograd. in the near future ; according to one version of this rumour, such occupation is threatened as the penalty of non-compliance with a demand by Finland for. the sale to her of the entire Russian Baltic Fleet.Reported Signature of Peace with Turkey. A Constantinople telegram (May loth) states that peace between Finland and Turkey was signed in Berlin on May 11th.MEXICO.Expulsion of certain Spanish Subjects. Mr. Cummins learns a protest by the Spanish Minister against the arbitrary expulsion of certain Spanish subjects from Mexico has been slighted, by the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs.NETHERLANDS.Hire of Dutch requisitioned Ships. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government are exchanging views as to an equitable arrangement for payment of hire for the Dutch tonnage recently requisitioned. It is estimated that the total hire to be paid will be 1,200,0000 monthly. The Dutch shipowners desire to receive payment in Dutch currency, provided the rate of exchange does not fall below a given point.Negotiations for Rationing Agreement, The Netherlands Overseas Trust, acting with the knowledge of the Dutch Government, has submitted formal proposals for a. general rationing agreement, based on the recent discussions in London.Dutch, Fast Indian&apos;Shipping. Negotiations are proceeding between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Netherlands Government, with a view to the continuance of Dutch East Indian merchant vessels in the trade to American, Japanese, and British ports, in consideration of certain guarantees and facilities offered by His Majesty&apos;s -Government.
Dutch East Indian Embargo. According to a Hague message of May .14th, shipping to America has been resumed, and a beginning made with the issue of export licences for goods the export of which was prohibited.   (See Report No. 67.)Deported Export of Horses to Germany. Handelsblad (May 14th) reports that the export of 2,500 horses to Germany began at the end of last week. This export, it says, is in part fulfilment of an agreement which was concluded in October 1917 for the export of 5,000 horses, and in regard to winch a credit arrangement has now been arrived at.NORWAY.Great Britain and the Norwegian-American Agreement. The Norwegian Asso-ciations are being invited to renew their old agreements with His MajestyA Government so far as consonant with the Norwegian-American Agreement lately concluded. Export licences would be granted for commodities formerly imported by the Associations, and their outstanding certificates (subject to confirmation by them aud renewed application by shippers) would be honoured. The general embargo on exports from the United Kingdom to Norway may now be regarded as raised, and all goods not affected by specific embargoes will be allowed, to go forward, ddie specific embargoes will be reconsidered in the light of the new general agreement, ddie Norwegian Government, in order to control exports under the new Agreement, has prohibited, as from May 10th, the export from Norway of all commodities except under Government licence..Purchases of English and American Notes. The recent purchases in Norway and elsewhere (see Reports Nos. 60, 62, 65, and 67 under &quot; Netherlands,&quot; &quot;Norway,&quot; or &quot;Switzerland&quot;) of English and American Bank Notes have been suggested by Drammens Tidende as possibly due to &quot; cheques from subjects of enemy countries not being honoured in England and Araei&quot;ica-&quot; Another suggestion made in the Norwegian Press is that subjects of the Central Powers wish to secure capital not taxable in Germany, eAren at the loss of interest.German and Norwegian Shipowners. According to a report received, the Germans are stipulating that in cases where Norwegian owners are having new vessels Built in Holland partly of German material they must make a certain subscription to German War Loan or investment in German Treasury Bonds.The Advanced Socialists. In. a Memorandum (G/f. 4587) upon Labour Troubles in Norway, the Political Intelligence points out that in spite of sporadic dis-turbances in April, there is reason to expect that the movement of the advanced Socialists in Norway will be limited in its results. ddiis is due, first, to the moderation of the Trades Unions, who are mostly controlled by the old Socialists ; secondly, to the sobering effects of responsibility, and generally to the fact that in a truly democratic State, such as is the Norwegian, the soil is not good for the Bolshevist growth. There is no reactionary party in Norway to be overthrown ; grievances can be removed by constitutional methods, and as the Government shows the intention to grant all reasonable demands, the ground is cut from under the feet of the extremist agitators.   (See also Reports Nos. 57, 60, 62, 63, and 65.)SPAIN.Spanish Merchant Fleet.- With reference to the proposed decree for requisitioning-the Spanish merchant fleet (see Report No. 68), a Madrid message (May 14th) states : &quot;A conference of Spanish shipowners unanimously decided this morning to oppose the scheme for requisition of the Spanish merchant fleet by the Government, and to offer instead their services voluntarily to the Government. The resolution,, wdbch was passed to the above effect, admitted that sacrifices and restrictions were-indispensable, to settle a dispute for which no one could be held responsible. The shipowners met again in the evening under the chairmanship of the Director-General of Commerce and of the Commissioner of Food Supply.   The latter, in accordance-
with an agreement which had been previously reached, submitted the following bases of a settlement: &quot; (1) The drawing up of a complete programme of imports and exports necessary to the nation&apos;8 business, with a list of names of ships assigned to carry the programme out..&quot;(2) A. tariff of freights,with a limit to their excessive rise, so that the paralysis - of Spanish trade might be ended and replaced by the stability indispensable to the normal development of commerce.&quot; The shipowners&apos; representatives appointed a Commission to examine the whole question and. draft a satisfactory formula. It is understood that the Spanish Govern-ment will abandon its intention of completely taking over merchant shipping: a scheme which has been unanimously opposed by a conference of Spanish shipowners.&quot;German Submarine at Carthagena. Sir A. Hardinge reports that the German Submarine U. 39, carrying a crew of 40 men, entered Carthagena harbour on the night of May 18th in a damaged condition. The vessel has been taken inside the Government Arsenal,&apos; It is stated that this submarine was accompanied to the harbour by a second, which was permitted to depart. Sir A. Hardinge is instructed to make representations to the Spanish Government upon the subject, and also upon the reported attempt of U.B. 48 to escape from Ferrol. (And see Reports Nos. 61 and 05.)SWEDEN.Mines in the Kattegat. Sir E. Howard reports the destruction, with loss of life, of two Swedish trawlers by mines in the Kattegat. The Swedish Press declares the mines to have been English, and expresses considerable indignation. Social Demokraten declares that the fact that the minefield was not notified has caused justifiable surprise. Stockholms Tidning declares that the indignation aroused by such acts cannot be allayed by any sum spent upon propaganda: and regards England&apos;s method of sea warfare as now no better than those of Germany. Several papers deplore the effect upon Swedish fishing. German Wireless of May 16th, 17th, and .18th quotes liberally from these and similar criticisms, notably a reference by Tiduingen to the mines in the Scheldt, and another by Svenska Dagbtad to the &apos;&apos;new offensive against the rights and property of neutrals, of which the annexation of Dutch tonnage was the most significant indication which we have had so far.&quot; According to a telegram, from Gothenburg to Verdens Gang the mines are believed by Swedish, fishermen to have been laid by Germans, who modelled them upon the English type.German Passes for Swedish Vessels. According to Dagens Nylieler of May 15th, an agreement has been reached between the German and Swedish Governments regarding the granting of German passes for Swedish, vessels running between Swedish and other neutral harbours on the North Sea and the Baltic. Application should be made to the German Naval Attache in Stockholm and the German Consul-General at Gothenburg. Basses, which will be granted from May 15th, will secure vessels against being taken to German ports for examination, and will only be given to vessels not entering the danger zone and not convoyed by enemy warships.Transit Goods in Sweden. Sir E. Howard enquires the views of the Foreign Office as to the advisability of permitting the sale of transit goods in Sweden, suggesting that such sale might be allowed after consultation with the Allied Blockade Com-mittee. in approved cases, under guarantee, and within the ration allowed by the proposed agreement.   (And see Report No. 66 ; cdso Report No. 68 under &quot; Norway.&quot;)&apos; Kraft Paper. According to a report received, practically the whole output of the Swedish Kraft paper mills is being sold to Germany. The &quot; Spin paper&quot; is used in the manufacture of yarn, rope, and various &quot;cloth&quot; manufactures, thus serving for many purposes as a substitute for cotton and wool.5g81-4bB
SWITZERLAND.German-Swiss Commercial Negotiations. Sir H. Rumbold reported on May 16th the settlement of a draft agreement between  the German   and Swiss delegates regarding coal.   Signature was, however, deferred upon a protest by the French Charge d&apos; Affaires against a further restriction proposed by the Germans upon the use of German coal ; and two Swiss negotiators have been to Paris to discuss the matter. Under the terms of the draft agreement the Germans offer to provide up to 200,000 tons of coal (and 19,000 tons of iron and steel) monthly; the price of the coal to be 173.50 francs per ton at pips mouth, with a rebate of 40 francs on 60,000 tons required for domestic purposes.   The Germans waive restrictions on the use of German coal so long as the import of Allied coal does not-fall short of the 85,000 tons a month offered by France to an extent proportionately greater than the shortage in import of. German coal.   [It is to this stipulation that objection was made by the French.]   The Germans agree to furnish about 30,000 tons of chemical manures, and certain quantities of potatoes, petrol, zinc, sulphate of copper and pharmaceutical pro-ducts.   The Swiss will provide milk products, chocolate and preserved meat, in about the same quantities as hitherto, aud from 15,000 to 17,000 head of cattle.   The Swiss also agree to set up an organisation similar to the S.S.S., to control the distribution of. German products.   The Federal Government on May 16th issued a communique, in which, the hope was expressed that, pending a decision,  Germany would not suspend her deliveries of coal, and the German delegates agreed not to do so before May 22nd.   German Wireless of May 17th, 18th, and 19th expresses considerable indignation and describee the French offer as a mere manoeuvre, aimed at compelling Switzerland to abandon its economic, and. ultimately its political, neutrality.   It, stigmatizes the S.S.S. as being like the Netherlands Overseas Trust, a violation of neutrality, and (quoting the Berliner Tageblatt) concludes : &quot; The fundamental feature of the coal question is, Switzerland- received until now every month 200,000 tons of coal from Germany at 90 francs.   The new German-Swiss Treaty disregarded the loan for keeping up the exchange value which existed until now, increased the price of coal by double, and provided for a sharp control concerning the use of the German coal.   Germany demanded, therefore, the same control which the Entente already possessed, in order that German coal should not be used for maintaining the ammunition industry working for the Entente.   France now offered a monthly delivery of coal up to 85,000 tons at 150 francs per ton ; the transportation question had to remain open, however.   A condition of the French offer was that Switzerland must, refuse to grant to Germany the same control which she had allowed to the Entente.   For Switzerland it is important to note that the fulfilment of the French promise to deliver the coal was very doubtful, and. that tire Entente was incapable of giving any guarantees for the delivery.   Since this French move was shattered, the Entente has contemplated the brutal application of compulsion by the delivery of its ultimatum.&quot;   Sir TP Rumbold observes that a maximum of 6,000 tons of coal a mouth above the amount already furnished would suffice for the needs of Swiss industry ; and that though Germans would insist on control at the factories, exports to the Allies would not in fact be impeded : under such an arrangement Allied coal and transport would be economised and a corresponding strain placed upon German resources. At the same time  he  considers  it  important  that Allied   prestige  should   be safeguarded.   (Sec also Reports Nos. 66-68.)Wood Convention. Lord Derby reports that the Wood Convention of May 1st (see Reports No. 66 and 67) has been approved by the Council of Ministers in Paris.Cotton Goods. An agreement for further restriction of the export of cotton goods to Germany, and for preventing the accumulation in Switzerland of stocks imported, from overseas, was signed at Berne on May 8th (see also Reports Nos. 51-53).Switzerland and Enemy Shipping in Spanish, Waters.  Sir A. Hardinge reports that the Swiss Government has requested the Spanish Government for certain supplies, for shipment of which the Spanish Government wishes to employ enemy ships now in Spanish ports. Such ships would fly the Spanish flag, and be manned by Spanish crews. The German Ambassador is stated to have disagreed with the proposal, while the Austrian Ambassador appears to have assented. The views of His Majesty&apos;s Government are invited.
URUGUAY.Uruguay and Germany. According to the Daily Review (N.S.) of May 18th, the Uruguayan Government lias issued the following official note (May 16th) : &quot; When the Uruguayan Military Mission was detained by a German submarine, the German commander justified his arbitrary act by the state of war between Germany and Uruguay, and said he was acting in accordance with the instructions of the German Ministry of Marine, which he produced.   Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded, that Germany should declare if the submarine commander had acted in accordance with the instructions of the Berlin Government, adding that, in the event of a negative reply, it should, declare if. it released our officers from their parole. Several days afterwards the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs offered mediation, in order that the Uruguayan officers should be released from their parole.    This mediation, was proposed by the German Ambassador in Spain,   ddie Uruguayan Government refused it, considering it contrary to the national dignity.   In addition, the fundamental point of die question, which is whether Germany is or is not in a state of Avar with Uruguay, must be decided, by her.   The German Government then communicated to the Uruguayan Government that it released the Uruguayan officers from their parole, but that it hoped, in exchange, that Uruguay would use her influence &apos; with France in order to induce the latter to permit the passage through French territory of the Chilean Mission at present in Spain.    The Uruguayan Government, without accepting the release of the Uruguayan officers from their parole, demanded a reply to the main point at issue, namely, whether Germany does or does not consider herself in a state for war with. Uruguay.   Later, the German Government replied that it was not in a stale of war with Uruguay, declaring, in addition, that the rupture of relations was not provoked by her, and directing attention to the silence of Uruguay regarding the passage of the Chilean Mission. In. the meanwhile, the   Uruguayan   Government asked  the Chilean Government whether it desired steps, to be taken with the French Government to obtain permission for the passage of its mission through French territory.   The.Uruguayan Government declared that it would only decide to take such a step out of deference to a friendly country.   The Chilean Government replied that it had no interest in the passage of its Mission through France,   due Uruguayan Government communicated this fact to the German Government, which replied to-day that the release of the Uruguayan-officers from their parole was not made subject to any condition, and the question of the Chilean Mission ivas due simply to its desire to consult Uruguay regarding the request for the passage of  the Mission through France, and that, in view of the negative reply of the Chilean Government, the German Government considers the incident as closed.&quot;   (See. Reports Nos. 63 and 65 under &quot; Uruguay,&quot; and 56 and 68 under &quot; Chile.&quot;)peace discussions.General.&apos; In a memorandum dated May 8th the Political Intelligence Department deals with German and Turkish activities in the Middle East since the Russian revolution, specdal attention being paid to the bearing upon the situation of the armistice of December 15th, .1.917 (Article X.), the Brest Treaty of March 3rd, 1918 (Article &quot;VII.), and to measures for economic penetration, especially Press reports of an economic annexe to the Brest Treaty.

(With reference to former reports, Mr. Wardrop on the same date reported in detail a Moscow Press report of the disposal of the Black Sea Avar vessels, and Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the same subject on May 17th.)German Wireless of May 16th reported, negotiations between Georgia (Russia) and Turkey about the separation of Georgia from Russia under- the Brest Treaty. A German representative &quot; is present.&quot;Russian Wireless of May 17th-21st contains several protests&apos; by Chicherin against German violations of the Brest Treaty in connection with Fort Eno, Rostov, the Don
legion; the Nevel region, German U-boats, &amp;e. On the same date Chicherin agreed by Wireless on behalf of the Russian Government to take part in negotiations with, the Ukraine at Kieff on May 22nd.On May 16th (received 22nd) Mr. Wardrop forwarded from Moscow proofs that, the majority of the Lettish population have no sympathy with Germany, and all reports to the contrary are inspired by the Germans.Lithuania. The Rheniseh- Westfaluphe of May 13th publishes the wording of the full preamble to the Kaiser&apos;s recognition of Lithuanian &quot;independence.&quot; It stipulates that the interests of the German Empire are to rank equally with the Lithuanians&apos; interests in their own country, and that Lithuania shall bear a share of the war burdens of Germany.   (See D.R.F.P.)On May 18th Sir II. Rumbold forwarded reliable evidence of the deliberate plunder of Lithuania hy the Germans, and of the farcical nature of &quot; independence&quot; as recognised by Germany.Ukraine. On May 19th. Russian. Wireless reported the departure of the Peace&apos; delegation from. Kursk on that date for Kieff.Rumania. The Times of May 22ud gives the following summary of some of the-&quot;peace&quot; conditions  imposed upon Rumania: Air article from the Frankfurter Zeitung, from which we gave extracts yesterday, explains with what care and fore-thought Germany has prepared to despoil Rumania for a generation to come.   The-unfortunate little kingdom, whose friendship Count Czernin  has  professed  his-eagerness to court, is doubtless bound by similar engagements to Austria-Hungary. She is forced to give most-favoured-nation treatment to the Central Powers.   She is forbidden to place export duties on petroleum, the industry in which is now under German control.   Germans are to enjoy special rights of acquiring land within her borders.   She cannot raise her duties, while Germany reserves to herself &quot; complete-freedom of action &quot; in a whole series of tariff questions.   Railway rates have been fixed favourably to Germany, and she&apos;acquires a permanent right of supervision over the Rumanian railways, together with- postal and telegraphic privileges.   For two years Rumania may sell food to the Central Powers alone; for the next seven years they have an option to acquire her surplus food produce.   That is the kind of peace which these Powers dictate to a people whom they are anxious, as Count Czernin has told us, not to embitter.The Admiralty Intelligence Summary from May 11-th to 16th contains the-following : A7eu; Regulations for Danube navigation. Article 21 of the Treaty of Bucharest deals with Danube navigation.   It is enacted: (1) That the European Danube Commission, comprising only representatives of States situated on the Danube or on the European coast of the Black Sea, shall control the river from Braila down-wards.   (2) No tolls (except those permitted by the new Danube Navigation Act) and no port duties are to be levied hy the Rumanians.   (3) Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Rumania may maintain men-of-war on the Danube ;-&apos;: &apos; they may navigate as far down-stream as the sea, and as far up-stream as the upper-frontier of the ship&apos;s territory.   They must not enter into any intercourse with the shore of another State, unless the latter&apos;s consent has been obtained through diplo-matic channels.   Each of the contracting Powers may maintain two guardships at The mouth of the river.With reference to last week&apos;s reports of supplementary &quot; agreements &quot; appended to the Bucharest Treaty, the terms of a special economic treaty between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Rumania were published in Vienna on May 14th. (D.R.F.P:,. May 16th.) The treaty contains three clauses, the first dealing with the Petroleum Agreement, the second with the Economic Agreement, according to which Rumania sells to Germany and Austria-Hungary the surplus production of 1918-19 of all kinds of grain (including oilseeds), fodder, pulse, poultry, cattle, meat, &quot;fibrous plants, and wool. Rumania further agrees to sell the surplus of this production to the Central Powers for the seven years following on 1919, should Germany and Austria-Hungary require such surplus.   The third clause deals with the Shipping Agreement.Lord Derby on May 20th (three telegrams) forwarded details of formal communica-tions to the Rumanian Government through the Allied Ministers at Jassy, protesting, against the terms which violate former European conventions.
Germany. (See under General and under Austria-Hungary.)Austria-Hungary. The Arbeiter Zeitung of May 2nd (D.R.F.P., May 10th) reported that a resolution containing the following words was passed at all the May-Day Socialist meetings in Vienna : -&quot; We again raise our voices on behalf of the ending of this war, that is destroying nations, by a general peace without avowed or concealed conquests, without war indemnities in any shape or form, on. the basis of the unfalsified right of self-determination of peoples. We protest against these principles, which can aloue found an enduring peace and secure the freedom of the nations, being injured by the treaties in the East. We demand that the war in the South and the West shall be ended by a peace of understanding and reconciliation. We demand the union of all nations in a permanent League of Peace, within which all disputes shall be decided not by violence but by right.&quot;On May . loth the Austrian Wireless published a message from the Vienna War Office giving reasons for evading the Russian request for a Russian commission to visit Austria-Hungary about war prisoners. The message refers to a Russian diplomatic representative being sent to Vienna after the ratification of the Peace Treaty with Russia,On May 16th Sir W. Townley reported, on. good, authority -some of the terms of the new Treaty between Austria-Hungary and Germany. The principal points seem to be (.1.) that the Austro-Huiigarian army comes as much under Prussian control as the Bavarian army, and the supreme control of military forces is united under one authority; (2) that a joint council has been set up to deal with inter-national policy and ensure complete unity, and (3) that economic. questions shall be decided at forthcoming negotiations in Berlin. On May 18th German Wireless published an account of an interview given to the Hungarian paper Az Est by Count Hertling, on the subject of the new Treaty. He said that the new agreements would be economic and military, and that &quot; the former &quot; is not directed against aiiy other States. sGerman Wireless of May 21st reported that the Norcldeutsehe Allgemeine had stated officially &quot; that the German Government had never been prepared to renounce even a small portion of Alsace-Lorraine.In a despatchdated May 4th (received 11th) Sir. H. Rumbold gave the following account of a letter published in the&apos; Fr&amp;ie Zeitung on the Emperor Charles-Prince Sixtus correspondence : It was written from Innsbruck, on the 18th ultimo, by a person in touch with the Vienna Court, and gives a new account of the whole series of events, that led to Czernhds downfall. Tlie writer declares that, before Czernin started for Bucharest, the Emperor Charles explained to him that he would not have auy despoiling of Rumanian territory, not even a &quot;rectification of the frontier.&quot; This assurance of the Emperor Czernin gave to King Eerclinand when they met at Bakau. On the way to Bucharest Czernin stopped at Budapest and had a long interview with Tisza. When he told Tisza about the EmperoEs orders, Tisza flew into a passion, and said that the interests of Hungary were going to be sacrificed once again. At all costs the EntperoEs wishes must be disregarded, and Tisza undertook to smooth over Czern.in&apos;s flat defiance of his niaste-Es orders by getting Berlin to put strong pressure on Vienna. Immediately on his arrival, Czernin dined with Marghiloinan to meet Kuhlmaun, who had already taken up his quarters at Bucharest. At that time Kuhhnann had never thought of stripping Rumania &apos;ol any of her territory, but lie easily fell in with Tisza&apos;s ideas when these were expounded to him by Czernin. &apos; In the meantime Tisza had corresponded directly with Berlin, urging the German Government to order Kuhlmaun to support Czernin in despoiling Rumania. The German Government, after a little hesitation, agreed to give the requisite authorisation to Kuhlmann. At fie same time they explained that they were not altogether satisfied with the Emperor Charles&apos;s attitude to his ally, and as the price of their compliance, they should expect Czernin to make a speech on his return to Vienna, which would recall the Emperor to a sense of hi-s duty to Germany.This*pledge Czernin gave. Meanwhile, the Emperor grew furious at the disregard of his instructions by his Minister, and both Czeriiin and Tisza grew alarmed that he might repudiate the treaty altogether. They therefore agreed to teach their Sovereign a lesson. They knew that he had been corresponding with his relatives of the House of Parma, and they thought that they could bring the Emperor into line
. 22  o-;. &apos;if Czernin in his speech made some discreetly veiled allusions to this clandestine correspondence. The idea that the French might take action on the matter never occurred to either of them. They felt sure that France would never break down the golden bridge to peace offered by Vienna,Accordingly, Czernin returned to Vienna. He promptly made his speech to a select audience, before even waiting on the Emperor, whose flanks he meant to chastise. No one was more astonished than he when Clemenceau published the letter to Prince Sixtus, and thereby brought about his downfall.Turkey. On May 9th (received 17th) Sir H. Rumbold reported on good, authority that on May 2nd Turkey and Bulgaria came to an agreement upon mutual territorial concessions in connection with peace discussions.Italy. Italian-Wireless of May 17th emotes from the Tribune a manifesto by the Women&apos;s Batriotic League against the &quot; iniquitous peace forced upon Rumania &quot; at Bucharest.Great Britain. In a report for the week ending on May 15th, the Ministry of Labour state that, in dealing with peace negotiations, pacifism and regrets for abandoned opportunities are now the themes for many writers in the Labour Bress.
