APPltECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND G Els1 EE A LREPORT, No. 50.PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Peace Discussions.Germany. German policy still appears to be dominated by the Military Authorities, and. its keynote is military effectiveness. The Appreciation by Sir 0. Spring Rice of the German, peace offensive is notable, lie considers that the object is to induce all Universalists in the Entente nations to oppose patriotism, and in that way to weaken the national will to stay the course until the object lor which they originally entered the war, security against -unbridled force and frightfuluess, has been attained. At&apos; the same time, the Germans instantly suppress all Universalism in their own country, and encourage patriotism.The German object obviously is to induce opposing nations to withdraw support in men, material, and above all in spirit, from their armies, and so to ensure a German victory.While the expression &quot; no, annexations &quot; showed up last week the insincerity of the Germans in their dealings with the Bolshevists, the expression &quot; self-determina-tion. &quot; has since been instrumental in disclosing acute differences of opinion between parties in Germany.The political situation still points to the probability of early attempts to gain a decisive military success, in order to strengthen the military authorities. The comments by the Intelligence Bureau upon the probable results of failure to gain such success are of interest.Russia. - According to latest reports, there is a consensus of opinion that the objects of .M. Trotsky and Lenin are to bring about revolutions in all countries, whether Allied or hostile to Russia, or neutral.In this connection, (lie prospects, of the extreme Socialists in Sweden receiving financial support from the Bolshevists is reported under Sweden.&apos;General. The German policy of breaking down military resistance by destroying patriotism and. national spirit lias succeeded in Russia, but the other nations of the Entente show no sign of weakening in their determination. Some of the Socialists in France, and. less publicly in Italy, seemed in Last \veek&apos;s reports to be attracted by vague and subtle catch-phrases of German or Bolshevist origin. Attempts to influence Labour in the United States are reported this week. The Ministry of Labour has recently reported fully on the influence of similar propaganda in the United Kingdom.For convenience in reference, a-summary of the recent speeches on war aims by Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson is given in an Appendix. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech has been conspicuously well, received in Entente countries, and seems to have excited much annoyance in the German Press, and. to have increased, the divergence of opinion between political parties.G.

Itforeign AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.The Foreign Office instructs Lord Bertie to express its gratification that the French Government is arranging to supply 150,000 tons of coal per month to Italy, and the hope that with the help of sea transport it may be found possible to increase this amount. The Foreign Office has invited the French and Italian Governments to nominate representatives to discuss the question of the supply of British coal to France and French coal to Italy.At the opening of the Rumanian Parliament on 30th December, no mention was made of the armistice or of the Allies.Sir G. Buchanan reports that the Commissaries of the People have assented to the proposition made by the Committee of Soviets that independence should be granted to Finland. Sir E. Howard reports the official recognition of Finland by Sweden, and indicates that such recognition may have been hastened, by a desire to anticipate similar action by Germany, which is now announced by German. Wireless Press. The local Swedish Consul-General. has been appointed Charge cbAffaires. Lord Bertie reports that France has recognised a de facto Government in Finland, a course which Mr. Lindley suggests to His M.ajesty&apos;s Government. Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the United States Government does not propose for the present to recognise the independence of Finland. Sir R. Rodd reports that the Italian Foreign Minister deprecates formal recognition, holding that this would virtually admit a termination of the Alliance, and would alienate friendly elements in Russia. Lord Bertie cites a suggestion by the Echo de Paris that in view of the divergence of Allied policy in regard to Finland, and the apparent divergence in Russian policy deducible from the withdrawal of Sir G. Buchanan, an Inter-allied Bureau for Russian Affairs seems desirable.Press reports state that the Finnish Delegation proceeding to England with a view to obtaining British recognition consists of Messrs. E. Wolff, Lorenzo Kihlman, Holste, and Professor Julio Renter. The Information Bureau states that all the above belong-to the Swedish party except Mr. Holste, who is believed to be a &quot;Young Finn.&quot;Sir E. Howard submits to the Foreign Cilice the desirability of a joint memorandum being presented to the Swedish Foreign Minister by the Ministers of Great Britain, France, and Italy, pointing oixt that it would have been preferable if Sweden, instead of notifying the Allied Governments of action already taken at Berlin, Vienna, and Constantinople, had addressed herself to all the signatory Powers of the Treaty of Paris ; especially as none of the Powers to whom, she originally applied is a signatory of the Supplementary Convention regarding the Aland Islands. At the same time the Allied Ministers would assure the Swedish Foreign Office of the continued realization by the Allied Governments of the special interests of Sweden.The Foreign Office learns that the Italian and the Serbian Governments independently lay stress on the importance of securing the freedom of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Chinese authorities have the situation in hand at Harbin, but 200 German prisoners have escaped westwards. Affairs are growing worse at Irkutsk, which is the headquarters of the German spy system. Japanese residents are applying for Japanese troops to be sent. 100.000 prisoners are at large at Krasjioiarsk. The Allies are calling the attention of the Chinese Government to the danger likely to arise through the escape.-of enemy prisoners. The Chinese troops at Harbin will probably be supported by the majority of Russians in Manchuria so long as they confine their action to the maintenance of order ; but should they attempt to take over the working control of the railway they will alienate all sections. At present they show no such intention. They might reasonably be allowed, however, to support Chinese Customs officers in the checking of transport of goods into Russia. If it should be found necessary to send additional Chinese troops from south of Chang Chun, it would be necessary to obtain the consent of Japan for their transport by the South Mahchurian Railway. The General Officer Commanding Russian troops at, Harbin has transferred the entire militia of 5,-100 men to Russia, and proposes raising a local force of 2,000 after their departure. The situation at Vladivostock demands increasing attention. Lord Bertie learns that the Bolshevists have taken control, and that the Zemstvos Committee, detained at Blagovestehensk, has asked for the moral support of the Allies.   The Japanese Government would seem to intend
action, and to desire such action to be independent. A Japanese battleship is being-despatched which will anticipate the arrival of a British cruiser.Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the Serbian Minister has approached the United States Government, supporting a proposal for the relief of the civilian population of Serbia, through the good offices of the Swiss Federal Council.Sir C. Spring Rice learns that the embargo on cables between Great Britain and Holland is a.cause of complaint by American shippers in regard to their transactions in the Dutch East Indies. It is stated that in this connection Canadian merchants have had an advantage over American merchants. Enquiry is therefore made as to whether the embargo can be modified.FRANCE. . -The Intelligence Bureau reports that there were 115 abstentions from the vote suspending the immunity of M. Caillaux. Among these were 76 Socialists, and -26 Radical Socialists. The whole of the last part of M. Caillaux&apos; speech was an appeal to the Left against the Right. lie attacked the Union Sacree as having placed the country in the hands of the forces of reaction. Unless the preliminary &quot;&apos; instruction &quot; confines the charge to that of intelligence with the enemy, the case will go before the High Court, i.e., the Senate. There appears to be some danger of anti-English and anti-Italian feeling being worked up in the matte]-, as many Frenchmen think that Clemenceau has been pushed into the in-osecution by the British and Italian Govern-ments. M. Pichon&apos;s speech was received with almost universal praise; the only criticism being by way of suggestion that a crusade of the oppressed peoples should, be openly preached, either in addition to or in substitution for a precision of the Allied war aims. The French loan is announced to be a great success, France alone having subscribed more than the 10 milliards asked For. With regard to food supply, France is better fed than England. A shortage of food is less likely and less dangerous than -one of. fuel; but for the present there is no great risk of either.BELGIUM.The Intelligence Bureau cites a pamphlet written by Mr. Troelstra, a leading Dutch Socialist, upon the treatment of Belgium by the Germans. Apart from general military damage, it appears, at a conservative estimate, that 5,000 Belgian civilians have been murdered and some 2,600 houses burnt with the connivance and often by the direct order of the German Officers&apos; Corps. Up to November 1917 a war contribution of sixty millions sterling has been levied on the population of some eight million persons ; tins is apart from enormous private fines and pillage and destruction to the extent of about 320,000,000?. Raw materials, machinery, metals (including church bells and bronze statues), silver plate and works of art have been seized in vast quantities and sent to Germany. Belgians of both sexes and every age have been enslaved to manufacture munitions for use against their countrymen. Everything possible has been done to ruin the possibility oil trade competition after the war. Finally, strenuous, but ineffectual, efforts have been made to set the Flemings against the Walloons.ITALY.Sir R. Rodd reports on 3rd January that instructions have been given to the Rome Police to intern all enemy subjects in provinces in the interior of Italy. Further steps will be taken in this connection. Sir R. Rodd draws attention to a valuable speech made by the reformed Socialist Raimondo. and to the organisation of a patriotic party by Signer Preziosi and the formation on the 16th December of the Federation of National Defence, numbering 120 Deputies and daily gathering new adherents from all quarters of the Chamber, united in a thoroughgoing prosecution of the war and complete loyalty to the Allies.The Intelligence Bureau reports Signor Crespi, the Food Commissioner, as stating that Italy&apos;s grain supply was assured up to the end of January, and that, if the Allies kept their promises, she could hold out until next harvest. Signor Nitti in his financial statement, observed that what Italy needed above all was grain, coal, and ships-and her difficulties would not end with the war.
GREECE.Lord G-ranville reports that M. Venizelos has arrived in Athens and explained to a large and enthusiastic audience the results&apos; of his mission to Great Britain and France. Lord Granville suggests that a proposal should be made to the Greek Government for an inter-Allied Commission to supervise the collection and distribution of the next harvest. He has already intimated, to M. Venizelos the desirability of an American Adviser on Food Supply.PORTUGAL.The Foreign Office instructs Sir L. Carnegie to inform the Portuguese Government that in view of difficulties in regard to the interpretation of Article 6 of the Anglo-Portuguese Commercial Treaty, it has been found necessary to withdraw the notifications of adhesion thereto of all the Dominions and Colonies except New-foundland.Sir L. Carnegie reports that during the night of 7th. January part of the Navy mutinied, and there was also desultory firing in the streets, but that order has now been restored.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.The Intelligence Bureau points out that the cessation of open discussion of the economic crisis in Austria-Hungary is traceable to the intervention of the censorship,, which, since the peace negotiations, has been endeavouring to create an atmosphere of stability and confidence. The Bolshevist attitude of hostility to class domination and imperialist ambition is, however, voiced in various sections of the Hungarian press, notably in. the official Socialist organ Nepszava, ; and the Hungarian Government (probably in collusion with -the reactionary party of: Tisza) ^as started an offensive against Nepszava, Az Est, and three other advanced journals. The Italian and Russian situations appear to have brought Count Czernin into closer approximation with Berlin than ever before, and undoubtedly the apioointment of the Bavarian Premier to the Chancellorship has had a beneficial effect upon the relations between Anemia and Berlin, Austrophil Munich acting as a useful intermediary. The hostility between Czechs and Magyars is causing violent recriminations in the Dual Monarchy. It appears that, the great mass of Czech troops has for long been too anti-Austrian, to be employed on the front, and that it has been used to hold down Bohemia. Interpellations in the Austrian Parliament adduced numerous examples of Czech &quot; treachery.&quot; The official recognition by France of the Bohemian Army as a distinct unit on the side of the Entente lias caused consternation and fury in Vienna, the more so as it is clear that such adhesion is national and permanent.On 1.8th December the Czechs, Jugoslavs and Ukrainians demanded in the Reichsrat the election of popular representatives for all the various nationalities of the Monarchy, to take part in the peace discussions at Brest. While the Austrian Premier rejected the idea of popular representation as being 11 contrary to the spirit of all Constitutional States,&quot; the German Agrarians opposed the bare idea of the nationalities being represented, and emphasised the rights of the Crown to. decide upon matters of peace and war.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Sir W. Townley learns that an immediate summoning of the Reichstag has been decided, against in opposition to both the Social Democrat factions who demanded it.The Foreign Office has instructed Sir W. Townley to ascertain through the Dutch authorities whether there is any truth in the German Press announcement that, as a measure of defence against air raids, British and French officers will be distributed among German towns. Sir H. Rumbold learns that, as a result of the recent air raid at Mannheim, there is a marked improvement in the behaviour of German soldiers in. charge of prisoners of war.Sir R. Paget learns from a good source that the German Zionists, since expressing their satisfaction at the British encouragement of Zionism, have expressed gratitude to the Austrian GoA-ernment for approaching the Turks in the matter ; and that the German Foreign Minister has recently discussed the cmestion in Constantinople.   It.
owould, therefore, appear that a counter-project is under consideration. A Catholic Conference is to be held in Switzerland at the end of January, Papal Delegates -are-to attend, and many Bavarians are expected, to participate. The bread crisis grows more acute, and, according to Hindenburg, the output of munitions is being affected by rumours of peace. A severe epidemic of typhus in the German Army is also reported. The German Government, however, has ordered the Press to discourage peace talk and to point to the favourable prospects of continued military action. Nevertheless, there is reliable evidence to show that Germany cannot hold out beyond April. Sir A. Hardinge, however, learns from a Spanish source that food conditions in Germany arc now improving. Grain is already arriving from Russia and. consign-ments of meat are expected in six weeks&apos; time. There is also a prospect of supplies of milk.The general opinion of the German press is strongly critical of the German, conduct of the Brest negotiations ; Avhereas the Government appears to regard their interruption as merely an episode, and clearly desires to proceed with them. Sir E. Howard learns from a good source that this protraction is designed to keep the Bolsheviks in play without any intention of concluding peace with them.The liheiniscli-Weslfalische Gazette of 6th January, in a leading article entitled &quot; Hindenburg or Kiihlmann,&quot; states that there is no reason to doubt the rumour that Ludendorlf contemplates resignation, and that the German people will be staggered by the blow.&quot; Now the German people must choose here between Hindenburg and Ludendorff on the one side and Kuhlmanu and Hertling on the other. Would it not be better at once to proclaim a truce before we fall into England&apos;s snare ?   We are strong enough should need arise to use again invincible arms in the West.   .   ..The Foreign Office learns that the political situation, in Germany continues much strained over the question of Prussian franchise reform. A sensation was caused owing to the suppression by the military of a meeting sanctioned by the Civil Authorities. The newspaper Vorwarts was suppressed for three days, and Minority Socialists have been arrested in many towns.   (Nee Peace Discussions.)NETHERLANDS.The Foreign Office informs Sir W. ToWnley and Sir G. Spring Rice that the Representatives of the Netherlands Government are returning to Holland to lay before their Government the present position of the negotiations with the Allies. It is believed that the Delegates recognise the readiness of the Allied Governments to meet, their wishes so far as circumstances allow. The Intelligence Bureau reports that the dissension between Mr. Treub, the Minister of Finance, and Mr. Posthuma, the Minister of Agriculture, over the export of cheeses to Germany, has ended in the withdrawal by the former of his prohibition. As Mr. Treub is the only pro-Ally in the Dutch Cabinet, his resignation, if it resulted, would perhaps bring about a considerable change in the method of carrying out the Export Control, and would j)erhaps result in the return to power of the pro-German financial and industrial magnate Mr. Kroeller. Should Mr. Treub resign, it is possible he would place himself at the head of a Liberal Commercial party in the interests of which he would work steadily till the elections of June 1918. The withdrawal by His Majesty&apos;s Government of cable facilities has reacted on the sympathies of tire Press. In the Telegraaf of 4th December Professor Niermayer calls attention to the appalling conditions in Belgium, and suggests that all the Neutral States should collectively draw the attention of Germany to the matter. The Socialist, M. Troelstra, also discusses, in the organ of the League of Neutral Countries, the sufferings inflicted hy the Germans on Belgium.Sir W. Townley reports that rumours have recently been circulated, apparently by hostile influences, that Great Britain is deliberately seeking a quarrel with Holland.SWITZERLAND.. Sir R. Rumbold reports the election of MM. Callonder and Muller as President and Vice-President respectively of the Swiss Confederation. The former is believed to have a pro-German bias, and the pro-Germanism of the latter is thorough and avowed. M. Haab, Swiss Minister at Berlin, has been elected to fill the vacancy left by M. Forrer4761-26 % b
in the Federal Council; lie is undoubtedly pro-German, and, being an expert in, railway matters, is expected to improve communications between Germany and. Switzerland. The remaining Federal Councillors, i.c, MM. Motta, Decoppet, Schulthess and Ador, were re-elected. The Federal Council for next year will there-lore in elude four pro-German members, and three MM. Ador, Decoppet and Motta  sympathetic with the Entente. M. Callonder will take charge of the Political Depart -ment, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will consist of MM. Callonder, Ador and Schulthess.Ford Bertie points out that the Resolution passed at the Paris Conference in regard to the supply of bread-grains to Switzerland in no way constitutes an obligation to furnish Switzerland with the necessary tonnage. The Foreign Office has suggested to the Swiss Government the advisability of obtaining guarantees from the German Government that, should grain,be carried to Cette (under the American-Swiss Agreement) in Dutch ships, such ships would not be molested by submarines.Sir C. Spring Rice advises the Foreign. Office that the United States Government, with a view to reducing Swiss exports of cotton goods to Germany, is prepared to adopt an arrangement, in concert with Great Britain and France, for limitation of cotton exports to Switzerland.NORWAY. &apos;The Foreign Office learns that the belief in Norwegian Government. circles that the Allies contemplate -peace negotiations is likely to have a prejudicial effect upon the arrangements for an agreement between Norway and the United States. Although the Norwegian Foreign Office intimates its dependence upon the United States for food supplies, there is evidence that it is endeavouring to obtain them both, from Russia (upon German suggestion) and Germany. Meanwhile, an appeal by the Norwegian Prime Minister for food economy has been read in all the churches.The Intelligence Bureau reports that as the result of the recent trial at Bergen, several German spies were convicted. The evidence showed that German agents were informed of the departure of Norwegian vessels, which were in due course torpedoed by submarines. &quot; No doubt can be left in the mind of any reasonable &quot; man that Norway has been and is honeycombed with German agents acting under &quot; every kind, of disguise. It is equally clear that there are corresponding agents in &quot; this country.&quot; The Norwegian press is pessimistic about the prospects of the Entente, but this attitude is qualified by recognition of American determination and of the disappearance of the German Colonies. As in. Denmark, the submarine warfare is operating as a counter-irritant to the British blockade.SWEDEN.Sir E. Howard reports the resignation of Air. Bran ting, owing to serious illness and overwork. He is succeeded as Minister of Finance by Mr. Thorson, Socialist Deputy and Parliamentary Controller of the Riksbank.Sir E. Howard learns that an agreement between Sweden and the Allies is felt to be problematical on the ground that Sweden is dependent for coal upon Germany, and therefore cannot reduce the export of iron ore 10 that country. If England could supply 250,000 tons of coal per month to Sweden, it is suggested that this difficulty would disappear. The rates of insurance, which amount to nearly two-thirds of the freight charge, might be reduced by half, if His Majesty&apos;s Government could give positive assurances that convoys would be adequately escorted. Under these conditions English coal might compete in price with. German.The Intelligence Bureau points out that the Russian bogey has now been replaced by the real incubus of a German Baltic. &quot;Should Germany come out of the war &quot; with her wings merely singed, in ail probability Sweden will become a dependency &quot; of Germany in fact, if not in name. The peaceful penetration by Germany of the &quot; Scandinavian countries, not excluding Norway, is proceeding apace, and. something &quot; not unlike a revival of the old Hanseatic League will shortly appear in the Baltic.&quot; Towards Russia, Sweden is adopting a waiting policy. In regard to Finland and the Aland Islands she has up till now resisted the suggestions of Professor Westman atad the Activists to depart from, a policy of neutrality. The Swedish Press, which has for the most part been a&apos; fair barometer of the war, has lately adopted a significant attitude. The pro-German, papers, instead of trumpeting the German successes, have dilated on the horrors of war and the folly and wickedness of the Entente in having
rejected Bethmann-lIolweg&apos;s offer in 1916. Seheidemanh, the German Majority Socialist, -during his recent visit, had several interviews with Vorowsky, the Bolshevist Commissary. It is of interest to note that more than one Oriental agitator is at present in Sweden preaching the liberation of Egypt, India, &amp;c. With regard to Count CzerniiTs proposals, Mr. Branting considers they deserve a reply, and that discussions, once begun, should be followed up with a view to a democratic peace.DENMARK.Sir R. Paget learns that in the middle of December Germany purchased in Copen-hagen 35 million roubles for use after the war, Pending peace they will remain in Danish Banks.According to the Norwegian Press the Danish Socialists have sold their political assistance to Germany for cheap fuel (see Report No. 48, under &quot; Norway &quot;) supplied through a Company founded by the notorious Dr. Helphan, alias &quot;Parvus.&quot; This is believed to have influenced the proposal that the Socialist Peace Conference should be held at Copenhagen instead of Stockholm.Sir R. Paget notices two articles signed &quot; Jenssen Tusch,&quot; which have appeared in the Vortland for 28th December and 2nd. January, discussing the feeling in Denmark towards England and Germany respectively. The first, in reply to the Hamburger Nachrichten, explains how the various manifestations of Prussian violence since 1864 have combined to prevent Denmark accepting German treatment &quot; with a friendly smile.&quot; The second article points out that while the British blockade only sequestrates foodstuffs ostensibly destined for Danish consumption, the German submarine Avarfare involves the death of Danish, seamen.Sir R. Paget reports that representatives of the Danish Firemen&apos;s Union and the Norwegian Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union will shortly attend, in England a meeting of the International Seamen&apos;s Committee to discuss a post-war boycott of Germans and Austrians.The Intelligence Bureau reports that discussions continue as to whether the Icelandic flag can be flown . by Icelandic merchant vessels on the high seas, the real fact being that Iceland wishes to cut adrift from Denmark, retaining only a common Sovereign.SPAIN.A Royal Decree was signed on 3rd. January dissolving the Cortes, fixing a General Election, for the Lower and Upper Houses for 17th February and 3rd March respec-tiyely, and convoking Parliament for 11th March.Sir A. Hardinge reports a responsible Conservative opinion that even should a few soi-disant &quot; Regionalists &quot; win seats with. German assistance, the original Conservative policy of a neutrality benevolent to the Allies is the only policy really possible for Spain, and that the great mass of Republican and Socialist working men, being now convinced that &quot;the Kaiser&quot; is responsible for the world-wide misery, would not be seduced from that conviction by German gold. Sir A. Hardinge observes that the attitude of the military juntas, not being dependent on Parliamentary and Party considerations, remains an unknown factor. The recent rapid growth of the junta movement amongst non-commissioned -officers has resulted in Government action, and the great majority of non-commissioned officers in the garrisons have now been induced to sign, declarations renouncing the juntas.VATICAN.Count de Sails reports that the recent attacks upon the Holy See, which, appeared in the Morning Post, would seem to have done something to diminish the good effect caused by the recent British successes in. Palestine. He points out that the attacks, have found no echo in the Italian Press..CUBA.Mr. Leech draws the attention of the Foreign Office to the fact that Allied subjects will be affected by the Obligatory Service Bill which is shortly to come before -Congress.
sARGENTINA.The Foreign Office learns that plots to destroy grain slaps and meat-freezing: establishments are being organised by-Germans in the Argentine.GUATEMALA.Mr. Young reports that about 300 persons have been killed as the result of the-recent earthquakes, and at least 50,000 are homeless. The city is completely destroyed, and all business is suspended. Expressions of sympathy have been received by the President from the King and His Majesty&apos;s Government.MEXICO.The Mexican Press announces that Carranza has appointed General Trevinix to purchase arms and ammunition in Japan. Mr. Cummins reports the suggestion of the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires that in view of the United States prohibition of the import of such materiel to Mexico, its supply by Japan should not be encouraged by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Mexican Government has requisitioned all the steamers (seven in number) of the Mexican Navigation Company, perhaps in antici-pation of their possible sale by the. owners to the Allies. Two steamers have been, loaded at Vera Cruz with troops, one of which has arrived atTuxpan. It is rumoured that the railway line to Vera Cruz will presently be cut.Fresh attempts are being planned by the Mexican.&apos;Government for possession of the oilfields, and. with this object attempts are being made to bribe or coerce Pelaez. The United States Embassy is explaining to the Mexican Press that the Mexican Government has shown no readiness to come to a better understanding with the United States Government in regard to food supply. With regard to Oarranza&apos;s position, Sir C. Spring Rice points out that the United States has refused financial assistance, while Germany has promised but not provided it; and there is no other-candidate who would receive general support.The Foreign Office learns that as a result of the seizure by the Mexican Government in April 1917 of the Tehuantepec Railway, the partnership between that Government and Messrs. Pearsons was dissolved, and about 20,000,000 Mexican dollars became due to the Mexican. Government. This transaction, though in the nature of a compulsory winding up, has apparently given rise to a suspicion in revolutionary circles that His Majesty&apos;s Government now aims at staving off Carranza&apos;s fall, and adopting the policy attributed to the United States of bolstering up alternate parties, to the ultimate ruin of the country.Carranza left the capital on 28th December and his continued absence is causing, comment.UNITED STATES.Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the Russian and. Italian set-backs have hardened the determination of the United States public for the vigorous prosecution of.the war. Energetic measures are also being taken for the detection and suppression of German intrigues. The American people is beginning to realise the German policy of encouraging universalism Catholic, Jewish and Socialistic everywhere but in Germany, where Catholicism itself is threatened with subordination to Germanism. The national spirit is, therefore, being awakened in America. In this connection there is a change for the better in the spirit of the Irish. With regard to shipbuilding, very serious efforts will have to be made to carry out an adequate programme, and to compensate for the difficulties created during Mr. Denman&apos;s tenure of office.The visit of Sir Frederick Smith promises excellent results.SHIPPING SITUATION.According to the War Trade Intelligence Report, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost
owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period 28th December 3rd January inclusive was 91,795 tons gross, of which 62,406 were British, as compared with 116,384, of which 71,005 were British, reported last week.Out of the 200,000 tons of Danish shipping employed, under agreement, in the Anglo-French coal trade there is now a deficit of 35,0.00 tons due to sinkings. The Danish shipowners are unwilling to make this good, pointing out that losses to Danish shipping chartered by the Allies represent at least 40 per cent, per annum of the ships employed, and that of such tonnage as the British and American embargo leaves to Denmark, namely, 150,000 tons only, 25,000 tons have already been lost.The United States Authorities are of opinion that Spain should be able to spare about 250,000 tons net for Allied use.The Board of Trade points out the importance of attaining an Anglo-American shipbuilding programme which should attain a rate of 9,000,000 gross tonnage per annum by next Autumn. The limit of saving on imports has almost been reached, war claims on tonnage may increase, losses may be greater than anticipated, and a large American Army has to be moved and maintained. The following approximate estimate is given of losses and replacements during the war up to 30th November 1917 : Gross Tons.War losses of British vessels       -             - -     5,800,000War losses of Allied vessels    - 1,900,000War losses of Neutral vessels      -            - -     1,900,000Total marine and other losses - 1,700,000Ships repairing or detained through enemy action -     1,400,000Total           -     .    - .12,700,000DeductNew construction, sav 5,100,000, prizes and detainedvessels 1,900,000 &quot;- 7,000,000Total net loss   -      -     5,700,000This leaves available some 30,000,000 gross tons, of which about one half is British., and three-fifths of the remainder Allied. At the end of October 1917 available British tonnage was being employed as follows : Service of the Army and Navy    -             -            - 3,763,000Service of Allies                 -                -                - 1,026,000 .Colonies       ----- 692,000Permanently abroad and coasters            -                - 1,275,000Oilers          -            -            -             -            - 1,013,000Available for British trade (other than oilers)            - 6,469,00014,838,000The decline of British imports in 1917 on 1913 is about 30 per cent., and in view of the staple character of most of these and the abnormal demand, this reduction has been a matter of serious difficulty. More than 90 per cent, of imports during 1917 have been supervised by Government Departments. The demands of France and Italy for cereals during 1918 will probably reduce British imports below the 1917 level by the equivalent of more than six million tons carried the average leugth of voyage.These figures demonstrate the very large extent to which Great Britain is employing her reduced shipping tonnage in the common war interests of the Allies.A Conference held at Paris on 3rd December 1917 resolved that an Inter-Allied Council of Imports and Tonnage should be created, composed of two Ministers from England, France and Italy respectively, and of one or two delegates from the United States Government. The French Government has designated M. Clementel, Minister of Commerce and Shipping Transport, and M. Loucheur, Minister of Munitions, as its representatives.4761-26 c
&apos; PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General.After, experience of the methods of German propagandists in the United States, Sir C. Spring Rice reports that Germany&apos;s attitude is to encourage &quot; universalism &quot; in enemy countries as being hostile to the national spirit, but to suppress it in Germany. Amongst Universalists, some of whom may put other considerations before national spirit and patriotism, Sir C. Spring Rice includes Socialists, Catholics and Jews. The influence of German peace propaganda, looked, upon from, this point of view, may be gathered from the subjoined reports on individual foreign countries. With reference to ourselves, it is interesting to note the opinion of the Cologne Gazette that &quot;The dreams of international. Socialism, are a matter of supreme indifference to the English workman,&quot; but the same paper expresses the German hope that British soldiers returning from the front will find a ferment amongst their male relatives of which there could be no question 18 months ago.Russia.Sir G. Buchanan reported, on January 3rd the publication in Petrograd of a telegram sent by the President of the Russian Delegation to the Presidents of the Delegations of the Quadruple Alliance pressing for the transfer of the peace negotiations from Brest to Stockholm. The refusal of this request is referred to under the heading of Germany.The Military Attache at Petrograd reported on January Otb that M. Trotsky&apos; had apparently decided that it was impossible to resist the German, demands, and that during the night of January 4th he had made up his mind to abandon his bluff of the January 3rd, and to come to terms with the enemy. He further reported on the authority of one of the Russian Delegates from Brest, that the Germans had assumed the attitude of victory at the Conference, and that the Bolshevists considered peace at any price to be necessary for Russia, and will make a separate peace in order to remain in power. M. Trotsky and his friends have so ruined the Russian Army that if he were to break off negotiations, the enemy would advance a few kilometres and , capture his guns.Sir G. Buchanan reported on January 0th. that M. Trotsky appeared to be ready to accept the German terms, and was preparing his retreat, and that this was the unanimous opinion of well-informed Russians outside the Bolshevist camp. The Mayor of Moscow thought that, judging from the way in which Trotsky&apos;s policy had advanced. German interests, he must evidently be a paid German agent. Russian Wireless of January 6th issued a long statement about Peace negotiations, in.which an attempt is made to throw the responsibility of the situation upon the Entente Allies.M. Trotsky arrived at Brest on January 7th. Before the arrival of the Bolshevist representatives, the Germans took the opportunity of conducting negotiations with the Ukraine representatives. . .Mr. Li ml ley reports from Petrograd. on January 7th that the Bolshevist movement is now completely in the hands of Lenin and Trotsky, whose object is to raise revolutions everywhere and to do away with all sense of nationality and religion, and with property. Both men are specially hostile to Great Britain because of the solidarity of our institutions. This opinion of the Bolshevist policy is confirmed by a report from Sir M. Eindlay (January 0th).Germany.Sir W. Townley reports that much diversity of opinion, exists in Germany about summoning the Reichstag. On the 1st of January, Grand Admiral von Tirpitz had a long conference with the Imperial Chancellor. Hinderiburg and Ludendorff arrived in Berlin on the 2nd. of January, and were received by the Kaiser.On the 3rd of January the Voriedrts expressed the opinion that the only object of the meeting of the Crown Council was for the Chancellor to reach an agreemeut with his Supreme Army Command under the Presidency of the Kaiser, thus acquitting himself of his responsibility to Parliament. Regret was expressed -that the demand of the Social Democrats for the calling together of the Reichstag had not found general, support.   The Government must recognise that the conclusion of peace is desired by
the Reichstag, and a feeling of discontent is excited amongst the people. A division of public opinion is threatened and the setting aside of diplomacy.Sir R. Paget reports on the 3rd January that the German Minister at Copenhagen had been heard to say that Germany would be willing to discuss peace on the following lines : Restitution of Lorraine Plebiscite of Alsace Return of Colonies Economic free band in Russia.Sir A. Hardinge reported on January 7th that a high Spanish authority had told the Military Attache at Madrid that Germany, in order to obtain peace, was willing to restore Belgium, but all the belligerents must share expenses of restoration. The restoration of Servia and Rumania would be agreed to, but no indemnities. Alsace-Lorraine would be allowed a plebiscite about being French or German. Portions of France occupied would be given back, ft was considered essential that Antwerp should be a free port.At the first sitting of the main Committee of the Reichstag, the Chairmau, Fehrenbach, in opening the meeting, referred to the negotiations at Brest and said, &quot; Whether the Western Powers will take&apos;part in the negotiations is not yet sure, but &quot; if not, they may very well have occasion to regret having rejected the hand of &quot; Peace held out to them.&quot; The Chancellor then promised on behalf of the Govern-ment to make a communication concerning the progress of the peace negotiations. The Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Baron von clem Bussche, described the attitude of the Russian delegates at Brest. The Catholic member, Erzberger. accentuated, the importance of the interpretation of self-determination, and recommended that it should be, applied and carried through clearly and openly;Dr. David (Socialist) stated that the principle of self-determination would lie furiously contested by Pan-Germans, but it was really immensely practical, for other-wise there can only be a peace based on violence, which would, have no chance of success and would never be permanent. After a Pan-German speech by the Oonser-vative Count Westarp, who strongly opposed the principle of self-determination, the Imperial Chancellor referred to the Russian proposal to transfer the negotiations to Stockhoh , which von kuhlmann had. been directed to decline. He then spoke of the Russian attitude about the German interpretation of the expression self-determination of nations, and added., &quot; We base ourselves upon our position of power &quot; (Machtstellung). Baron von deni Bussche said that the essence of the questions at issue with the Russians was the right of self-determination of nations.Sir W. Townley on the 4th of January called attention to a strong article in the Rheluisch, Westfdlisehe Zeitung implying &quot;that one of the motives which drove England into the war was to seize. German East Africa and. so realise the dream of a Cape to Cairo Railway.Sir .11. Rumhold on January 5th quoted an official German communication which had reached Berne to the effect that the Grown Coxtncil, attended by Hindenburg and Ludendorff on that day, had decided to break off the Brest negotiations temporarily.German Wireless reports on January 7th that a message, signed, by von. fvuhlmann, had been sent to the Russian delegation pointing out that the stipulated 10 days had been exceeded, and that no declaration about peace negotiations had been received from any of the other belligerents. ;   ..The British Prime Ministers speech to Labour representatives on. war aims is summarised in the same German Wireless report, without comment.Sir W. Townley quotes on January 8th reports in the German Press of another telegram from Grand Admiral von Tirpitz to the Imperial Chancellor, offering the transference of the peace conference from Brest to Stockholm, and urging remem-brance of the needs and national dignity of Germany ;1 in order that the nccessary position of power in the world may be achieved for her.&quot; A Wolff telegram from Berlin to The Plague says that the Social Democratic Party demands a renewed, adhesion by the Reichstag to their July resolution, and presses for &quot; self-determina-tion,&quot; honestly ascertained by a free and independent expression of the will of the people of occupied territories. On the other hand, the National Labour Party are convinced that the demands of the army leaders for security of frontiers should be accepted, and that a German peace is the only security for the German future. Sir W. Townley thinks that the political situation in Germany is momentarily becoming more acute.The Intelligence Bureau (January 7th) rej)orts : &quot; The German nation are being &quot;&quot; deliberately worked up to believe in the immediate prospect of a great military
success. This is a very dangerous weapon. Supposing that, the attack does not &quot; lead to the success which is promised .... There will then inevitably be &quot; a great reaction .... If the offensive takes place in the early spring, and &quot; fails after say six weeks or two months, the failure will coincide with the time when. &quot; scarcity of food is becoming most serious. In that case the reaction in Germany &quot; will produce a very critical situation.&quot;Russian Wireless reports on January 5th, on the authority of German deserters,, that new German units for the Western Front are being organised at Kovno and Vilna, in contravention of the armistice agreement. This is causing unrest amongst German troops, and about 25,000 have revolted and entrenched themselves east of Kovno. This report is confirmed by information received, from Sir G. Buchanan (6th January), who adds a rumour that because other German troops are unwilling to-attack them the method of starvation is to be applied. Berlin Wireless of January Slh calls the story a fabrication intended as a soothing-draught for the Russian people.Austria-Hungary.Sir W. Townley heard on January 4th that the Austrian Minister at The Hague had said that von Kuhlmann was trying to induce the Kaiser and the German. Government to accept the Bolshevist demands, and, if they did not do so, Austria-Hungary would make a separate peace with Russia.Sir W. Townley reported on January 7th that, according to a Wolff telegram from Vienna, the desire of the Russian Delegates to transfer the site of negotiations to a neutral country is looked upon there as an attempt by Neutrals to cause delay, and so gain time for exercising an influence.Lord Bertie (7th January) calls attention to an article by M. Herve in Vicloire, expressing an opinion that the British Avar aims laid down by the Prime Minister offer-favourable terms to Austria-Hungary in the event of a separate peace.France.Lord Bertie, on January 3rd, drew attention to an article by M. Thomas in Tlumanite, deploring M. Olenienceaids refusal to allow the Socialist deputation to go-to Petrograd. M. Thomas writes that French Socialists look upon a separate peace between Russia and Germany as a misfortune for the cause of Socialism and of France. It would mean a term of German Imperialism over Russia and the impossibility of effecting a just and lasting peace. French. Socialists wish to say to Russians, &quot; We &quot; are as Socialists against a separate peace, you also . . . aim only like us for a &quot; general peace established on liberty of peoples and international justice. Any other &quot; peace is anti-Socialist.&quot; On. the 8th of January M. Cachin (Socialist) strongly supported Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s statement of war aims in the same paper, especially on the references to the German colonies and the future society of nations.Le Temps and Debate publish strong articles on the appeal addressed from Stockholm to Socialists in Entente countries to attend a meeting of the International Party, and to use any means to obtain passports. They describe the appeal as made in Germany, and as being probably the handiwork of Seheidemann with German official approval.The French Press contains full reports of the British Prime Ministers declaration, of&apos; war aims, and great satisfaction is expressed.   M. Thomas observes with satisfaction in Tiiunanite that it pledges not only the Government but the whole British nation for the Alsace-Lorraine question.Italy.The Minister for Foreign Affairs told Sir R. Rodd on January 8th that he would not permit delegates to attend the Socialist Congress at Stockholm, and hoped that the Allies would adopt the same policy. If the Italian delegates did go, the present good spirit would he upset, internal dissension, would revive, and there would be a revolution against the continued prosecution of the war.Further, lie would not recognise the Bolshevists, or allow couriers to come to Italy.United States.Sir C. Spring Rice [on January 6th reports the satisfaction of President Wilson with the British Prime Ministers statement of war aims.   He also reports that the-
Bolshevists appear to he trying to get into touch with the Labour Parties in the United States.A summary of the Presidents recent speech on war aims is given in an Appendix. Norivay.The Intelligence Bureau draws attention to the Conference held early in December by the &quot; Scandinavian Friends of Peace.&quot; The final meeting terminated none too peacefully, because a discussion was raised by the Mayor of Stockholm, one of the Swedish, delegates, who moved, a resolution of sympathy with the Russia!! Bolshevists and adherence to their peace proposals.Sweden.Sir E. Howard reported on January 2nd that the Executive Committee of the Council of the Swedish Social Democratic Party had passed a Resolution declaring that the chance of transforming a separate peace into a just, immediate and general peace depends mostly on where the International meeting can he held, and appealing to Socialists in all countries, especially England, France, Italy, and. America, to use all means to procure passports. When Governments fail to show a desire for peace, the people must enter into relations with one another. This Resolution was unanimously adopted at a crowded Labour meeting.On- January 7th he quoted reports from the Swedish Press that Extreme Socialists coming back from Petrograd are confident of financial assistance from the Bolshevists for propaganda purposes. Accounts differ about the question whether such funds would be devoted to local, revolutionary or anti-militarist propaganda, or to other purposes less dangerous to Sweden.Denmark.Sir R. Paget on January 4th referred to local rumours that the proposed Socialist Conference ought to be held at Copenhagen, instead of at Stockholm. He believed that demands were being made to carry out that proposal because Copenhagen has a less pro-German reputation.United Kingdom..The&apos; Ministry of Labour reported fully (January 2nd.) on recent peace propaganda, possibly inspired by Germany, and intended to dispel the spirit of national unity which permeated the United Kingdom in the early stages of the war. In these propaganda, subjects like &quot;Profiteering,&quot; &quot;Inequality of Sacrifice,&quot; &quot;Capitalists&apos; War,&quot; and such like topics are harped on, and the propagandists were obtaining some success (G.T. 3100).The Intelligence Bureau on the 4l,h of January submitted proposals for propaganda to counteract war weariness in the Nation and Army (G.T. 3226). The cpiestion of a psychological offensive was before the War Cabinet on January 2nd.GENERAL;General Williams reported the arrival at The Hague on January 2nd of 207 non-commissioned officers and men and 28 officers ; and on January 3rd of 369 civilians, all for repatriation; also on January 5th of 43- officers, 248 non-com-missioned officers and men and one civilian, for internment in Holland.-17(11 2bD
