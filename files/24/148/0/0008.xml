SECRET.AP P I IE C J [A TJ 0 N OP TEE ATTACHED  WEST&apos;RUN&apos; AND GENERALREPORT No. 57.PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Peace Discussions.Eastern Front. Last weeJPs Appreciation holds good. The terms offered by the Germans to the Bolshevists, and accepted, involve the surrender by Russia of a strip of territory extending from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and estimated to cany a population of 55,000,000. The present situation is obscure, and, I think, without precedent ; while agreeing to negotiate a peace at Brest-Litovsk, the Germans have refused the armistice for which the Bolshevists pleaded, and continue their military invasions of Russian territory, doubtless with a view to holding as many cards in their hands as possible during the negotiations. In this connection the prospects of Japanese action in the Ear East are of interest.The issue of the Rumanian peace discussions is still in the balance.Western Front. It is difficult to gauge the object Count Hertling had in view in making a speech full of plausible sentiments, of which the insincerity could so easily be demonstrated by the logic of facts. The general, opinion seems&apos; to be that his intention was to try and drive a wedge between Great Britain and the United States. The interpretation sent by Sir E. Howard (that the speech has some bearing on the advertised great offensive movement in the West) is of interest. It may be a bid for the support of national, sentiment for the attacking armies; the reference to &quot; freedom of economic development, in every direction &quot; reads like an appeal to the commercial and industrial, classes to support the continuance of the war. Further development of this theme should lead to great divergence between German and Austro-Hungarian war aims.ALL! ed Alt airs.References to the Far East are of special interest.Italy.The political situation is described.

PART II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Supreme War Council.--The Foreign Office was informed on February 22nd that General Sir Henry Raw] in son had that day taken over the duties of Military Representative upon the Allied Council.Far Fast. Sir J. Jordan learns that the Chinese Government (probably in order to strengthen its position against the South) has consented to Japanese intervention in Siberia/The Chinese Press displays great interest in the project. Sir C. Greene reports that the Japanese Government organ Kokumin declares that the German and Japanese battle fronts now meet, and that for self-preservation, Allied interests, and peace in the East, Japan must take up righteous arms. Sir C. Greene learns that the United States Government is not disposed to deprecate any Allied action which could not be represented as contrary to democratic development in Russia. The United States warship Brooklyn, after calling at Japan, is proceeding to Vladivostock to convey a greeting from. America to the Russian. Nation. Mr. Lindley reports that there is a strong desire in Siberia for Allied, intervention, and. states that such a course is imperative unless the whole of Russia is to fall under German influence. The Foreign Office has advised Lord Reading of the urgency of the situation and instructed him to invite the views of President Wilson upon the attitude of the Entente towards Japanese intervention.Allied Purchases in United States. Lord Reading reports that owing to congestion of ports and in order to avoid, waste of labour, fuel and material, regulations have been proposed by the United States Government under which licences will not be granted for export of goods to Allied countries (other than direct purchases by the Allied War .Missions) unless the buyer has first received, permission to purchase through the United. States Purchasing (Joinmission. Such permission, whether for manufacture or exportation, is to be applied for by the respective War Mission on notification by &apos; its Government that an import licence has been granted to the purchaser. Its grant carries appropriate priority as regards completion and (it is hoped) rail transport. Lord heading suggests, as an alternative, that the purchaser, on obtaining an import licence from the Imports Restriction Committee should telegraph particulars and the number of his licence to the supplier, leaving him to approach the United States Purchasing Committee, who could obtain verification, of the licence number from the British Mission, to which.a weekly statement of import licences would-be sent.&quot;FRANCE,Humbert Case. The French Press states that the Governor of Paris will request the Senate to authorise the trial of Humbert on the charge of Intelligences area VEnnemi instead of that of Commerce avec VEnnemi, such request being necessary as the former charge entails trial by a Military Court.BELGIUM.Germans and Food Distribution. With reference to the protest suggested to the French and United States Governments by His Majesty&apos;s: Government (see Report No. 55) in regard to preferential distribution of food in Belgium by the Germans, Lord Reading reports the view of the State Department to be that it is doubtful whether, if such a protest were unsuccessful, it would be advisable to carry the proposed threat into action. It is therefore submitted that the present conditions, though logically unsatisfactory, should be allowed to continue.ITALY.Stability of the Government. Sir R. Rodd reports that on February 21th, speeches were, made by all the Ministers whose policy had been called in question.   In the
result the Government obtained a majority of. 340 votes in the Chamber of Deputies -over the usual  minority vote  of  4-1.     The   Chamber  thereupon  adjourned till April 15 th.Parlies in the Chamber. The Intelligence bureau points out that practically there are now only three parties in the Italian Chamber: the &quot;neutralist &quot; Parliamentary Union, which, after the defeat it suffered in December, is not likely to risk another -offensive at present; the League of National Defence, comprising Interventionists from all groups ; and the Official Socialists, who seem inclined to make the best of a Government which is obviously sincere in its efforts to establish national concord. A tendency is observable towards a sort of truce between the League of National Defence and the right wing of the Official Socialists.Goal and Grain. The Intelligence Bureau draws attention to the grave effects of -coal and grain shortage on the military efficiency and. civilian morale of the country. (and see under &quot; Allied Affairs &quot;).- Italy and the Subject Paces of Austria-Hungary. -The Intelligence Bureau discusses the growing entente between Italy ami the subject races of Austria-Hungary, -aimed at (1).attacking Austria from within, and (2) proving to the Western Allies that no half-measures can . produce a lasting settlement. The democratic groups represented by the Carrie re delta Sera, the Seeolo and UUnita, interpret the speeches of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson as requiring the renunciation not only of Dalmatia but also of Pola and Western Istria. Against the former claim they have always protested, as running counter to the facts of population, and - antagonising their natural Allies the Slavs. But the claim to Pola and Western Istria is unassailable on this ground, and their possession is regarded by all informed Italians as absolutely indispensable to l.taly&apos;s security in the Mediterranean. Failure to win. it as a result of the war would&apos;impose a heavy responsibility on the Interventionists, and would lead to a. Giolittian regime, dependence on the Central Umpires, and an undying grudge against the Western Powers. The Foreign Minister, however, still, appears to adhere to the letter of i.taly&apos;s full claims as guaranteed by the Treaty of April 1915. With regard to the second thesis delenda Austria it would seem that the Foreign Minister leans towards a federal solution of the nationalities problem, though this is in contradiction with the resolutions adopted by the Czech &quot; Constituent Assembly &quot; early in January 1918. On these, as on other points, the attitude of the Foreign Minister is thought to be incompatible with the democratic policy and temper of the present Government.ENEMY&quot; ALLIED AFFAIRS.Austria and Russia. Mr. Lindley learns that Austrian, troops are showing great unwillingness to march against Russia. Mr. Bagge, however, reports that strong detachments are threatening Ivieff.Poles and the Ukrainian Peace. The Lokalanseiger of February 21st reports uproarious scenes during the Provisional Budget debate in the Vienna House of Deputies. The Polish Resolution refusing to greet the young Ukraine Government was received by the Poles with loud applause.Food Conditions. In the course of the same debate, Dr. VVinkler, Social Democrat, in a speech which caused great excitement, severely criticised the methods of food supply.Naval Mutiny at Catlaro. The Admiralty reports a peaceful mutiny at Cattaro on February 2nd in most of the ships and barracks, the mutineers demanding peace and better conditions. An Admiral and several officers were locked tip. The intention appears to have been to take out some of the ships and deliver them to the Italians at Brindisi. Three battleships were sent from Pola to cpiell the mutiny, and these were fired upon, by the coast batteries on their arrival off Cattaro. Cases of mutiny in ships have occurred previously, and the cause is -always reported to have been bad food and bad treatment. The trouble would now appear to have spread both&apos;to the Fortress Artillery and the Aviation Service.
GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Government and People. Sir H. Rumbold learns that the Kaiser has again become-as aggressive as ever, and once more believes that he will one day make a triumphant entry into London at the head of his troops. The General Staff is quite determined to go on with the war, and will hear of no terms of peace that do not include a, protectorate over Belgium and annexation of Briey and. Longwy. There is no longer any talk of annexing revolutionary Russia apart from the Baltic provinces,, which Germans have always Considered as belonging to the Empire. Peace with, the Bolshevists is not thought necessary, but the German Government is very anxious to exploit the peace with the Ukraine by reorganising the railways and tapping the-food supply. No attention is paid, to Austria, whose armies are under German command. The Germans know that Count Czernihs speeches, which are perfectly sincere, cannot be carried into practice. Even if the Western offensive does not accomplish all that the Pan-Germans expect, the authorities think they will be able-to push forward some twenty or thirty miles, taking many prisoners and guns. This will put them in a belter position to negotiate a &quot; German peace.&quot; It will also overawe the discontented elements at home, by showing how great is the power of militarism. The food supply (which appears to have improved), supplemented by hopes-of a speedy peace, suffices to maintain the spirits of the general public. As for strikes, Legien, president of the Associated Trades Unions, is a very powerful, man, and a thick-and-thin supporter of the Government, and no serious general strike could be engineered against his will. The Majority Socialist leaders also have the movement well in hand. (In an article entitled &quot; Bolshevism &quot; in V or warts of February 24th, Fried rich Stampfer declares that German Social Democracy would never follow the Bolshevist lead by bringing disaster on its own country. Bolshevism at home promotes Imperialism abroad.) In any case, the strikers are women, elderly men, and lads, unarmed, and easily shot down. Nevertheless, the German Government is more alarmed about the internal situation than it cares to acknowledge. The recent strikes were essentially a demonstration of munition-workers against the war, and since the last message of President Wilson, the German people have begun to realise that peace is actually possible, and only prevented by the ambition of its rulers.Opinions on Annexation and Suffrage. The Foreign Office learns that the German advance into Russia was preceded by a wireless pronouncement by Prince Leopold of Bavaria that the Bolsheviks were lighting against the idea of separate nationalities : that for many years past the historical task of Germany had been the establishment of a barricade against forces threatening from the East, and that she was now the champion of European order against the moral disorder of Russia. The Berliner-Tageblalt of February 19th reports a meeting of the Agricultural League held on the .18th in. Berlin. The President, Dr. Roesicke, demanded the colonisation hy German)- of &quot;Livonia and Esthonia, and said that so long as the enemy saw the majority of July 19th dominant, there would be no peace. Wildgrabe, a recently elected deputy, criticised the democratic movement, and declared that there was no conciliation between democracy and Kaiserclom. Von Ohlenberg violently condemned the &quot; canaille at home and abroad &quot; who &quot;agitate against Hind enberg and Ludendorff, and concluded &quot;The Empire is no Empire of renunciation, but of power and magnitude-ficence for eternity.&quot; The Iiheinische Westfalisehe Zeitung of February 23rd reports the speech of the Polish Deputy Stychel in the Ukrainian debate in the Reichstag. It,appears that he was interrupted and called to order for speaking as a Pole rather than as a Deputy in the German Reichstag. Mr.Lindley reports that resolutions were passed by a meeting of prisoners of war in Petrograd protesting against an, Austro-German advance. The Milncliener Neuesle Naehrichlen of February 18th thinks that England would like to see Germany involve herself thoroughly in Eastern Affairs, and regards a Berlin-to-Tokio League as undesirable even if it were practicable. The &quot;free seas&quot; are Germany&apos;s vital element. Berlin-Tokio would be but a blind alley in which she could carry on trade but not world politics. Sir W. Townley reports that at a sitting of the Suffrage Committee of the- Landtag, a proposal negativing or compromising equal suffrage was passed. Twelve Conservatives, four Free Conservatives, and four National Liberals voted for the proposal,,, and eight Centre, three Liberals, one Social Democrat, one Pole, and two National Liberals  against it.    The   VossiscJic Zeitung sees in this decision not  the end
but (lie beginning of a decisive fight lor suffrage reform, which may be drawn out for months, and which will, demand the strongest nerves. . The Berliner Tageblalt remarks&apos; that the Conservatives have mocked the people to whom, the concession, had been promised by the King in his special, message, and continues : &quot;Thus does - a small Conservative clique permit, itself to impose on the people &quot;who, at the front, are enduring almost unbearable trials,.whilst at home it is &quot; suffering bodily privation and agony of soul, with patience. The. people, themselves &quot; will some day answer the Conservatives and their Allies the National Liberals.&quot;Vorwarts of February 20th in a leader while acknowledging the partial- responsi-bility of Socialists for the nomination of the present Government points out thatbthey will not give it blind support. Alluding to the Fasten! advance it declares, &quot;let it be &quot;seriously said, the further the German armies advance from their present base, the &quot; greater will be the danger of the Government departing from its political base, &quot; adopted by the majority in the Reichstag resolution of July 19th. 1917.&quot; With regard &quot;to the adverse vote on equal suffrage, it remarks that this is an example of Prussian, reaction which calculates that if the Government can. be made to yield on a miserable little plural voting question, it can be hectored little by little into greater concessions. The article concludes, &quot;All. these points must- be cleared up in the very near future.&quot;Supplies iron Russia. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports- that, quan-tities of grain are already being carried from. Russian Black Sea ports to Const an za., and that some 40 ships of about 2,000 tons which have been lying in South Russian ports since the beginning of the war are now likely to be used by the Germans for this purpose. German agents are openly negotiating for stores in Moscow and Petrograd. Among the valuable supplies accessible are quantities of high-speed steel and glycerine, and some valuable stocks- of manganese at Poti on the Black Sea.Propaganda. The German Wireless Press of February 23rd invents statements purporting- to be extracts from a speech, in the blouse of Commons withheld by the Censor from the French newspapers.armies/ Discipline.  Yorwarts of February 24-th reports a debate in the Reichstag on the bad feeling existing in the Army at the front. It was stated that, while many men remained for IS months without leave, officers&apos; servants were given leave in regular rotation to-bring their masters provisions. Soldiers with Social Democratic leanings were treated like dogs. Strikers and political, undesirables were pressed into the Army. General Scheuch, Head of the War Office, denied that men were sent into the Army on political grounds, but added that, agitators were sent there because they failed to fulfil the condition upon which they were excused from service at the front, namely, that of maintaining increased, home production chiefly in; munition factories.NETHERLANDS.Transit of Ore. With reference to the enquiry (see Report No. 50) as toJdie-amotints of copper ore and lead ore recently transmitted to Germany, the Dutch Foreign Office has informed Sir W. Townley that no such cargoes have been transmitted from Belgium to Germany through Holland between November 2nd and January 21st last.Export of Horses. Sir W. Townley has protested in regard to the recent exportation of horses to Germany (see Report No. 55). In reply, the Dutch Foreign Minister emphasised the importance of concluding an arrangement with the Germans for coal, in the supply of which they had fallen short of their undertakings. Sir W. Townley points out that the necessary amount of coal would appear to be guaranteed (and to a large extent already supplied), under existing agreements.SWITZERLAND.Maximalist Propaganda. Sir PI. Rumbold reports the activity in Switzerland of a Maximalist emissary named Holzmann.   At present he is at Zurich, where he is presumably   establishing connection with   the   extreme   Socialists, especially the-Italians ; and he is attempting to promote an International Conference, tils.-, -a a
NORWAY.Norwegian American Negotiations. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that the Norwegians are now stipulating for concessions in excess even of the generous proposals made by the United States Government (see Reports Nos. 55 and 56). &apos; Sir iVf. Findlay. learns that a dual agreement on the new terms is imminent.Bolshevism. Sir  M. Findlay   reports  a considerable Bolshevist  agitation,   hi. Norway.   At Christiania and other centres WorkmeAs and Soldiers&apos; Councils are being elected, and there is talk of a rising at the end of March with the object of seizing the food supply.Pyrites. His Majesty&apos;s Government is negotiating with, the Norwegian Govern-ment for the purchase of 250,000 tons of pyrites, provided that no pyrites shall he exported by Norway to Germany. The placing of contracts for delivery of this commodity over a series of years is also under consideration.SWEDEN.Aland. Sir E. Howard, reports that as the result, of Swedish mediation, agree-ments were made by the Russians on Aland with the White Guards and Islanders respectively, under which the two former consented to evacuate the islands. A Swedish guard lias been sent, which after controlling the evacuation will remain in occupation for the general protection of the islanders and of Russian stores. For this purpose. Bills have been passed in the Riksdag permitting the employment of conscripts outside Swedish territory (i.c., on Aland) till March 19.19, and allocating funds for their maintenance. The Liberal and Socialist papers have expressed great satisfaction with this solution, and the Conservative Bress refrains from criticism. Sir E. Howard learns that the occupation is intended as a temporary measure pending the restoration of peace, and that in the view of the Swedish Government, while the question of sovereignty rests between Sweden and Finland, the fortification or neutralisation of the islands are matters subject to the consent of the signatories of tire Treaty of Paris and should be left for settlement at a General Beace Congress.Swedish, Negotiations ipitli Allies-. The Foreign Office advises Lord Reading that the Swedish and. Allied Delegates have now prepared Heads of Agreement for sub-mission to their respective Governments. The terms of the proposed Agreement include the allocation to the Allies of 500,000 tons of Swedish shipping and a considerable limitation of Swedish exports.Export of Iron Ore. Politihen in a leading article declares that if Germany fights Russia Swedish workmen should refuse to permit the exportation to Germany of iron ore, which would find a ready market in the Entente.Count Luxburg. The Foreign Office advises Sir E. Howard that His AIajest.y&apos;s Government, has no objection to Count Luxburg proceeding as desired to Sweden (see Report No. 56, under &quot;Argentina &quot;). Safe conducts will not be provided for his entourage, whose names must be communicated in advance. The ship must be examined at. a British port, and may not afterwards call at any neutral port before reaching her destination in Scandinavia.DENMARK.Danish-American Negotiations. The War Trade Bureau reports that the Danes have now presented, a comparatively acceptable reply to the proposals of the United States War Trade Board (see Reports Nos. 52 [Shipping Situation] and 55). They offer to limit their exports to Germany of bacon, butter, eggs, cheese, and fats to 700 T.ons per week and to send the balance of their dairy produce to the United Kingdom at current export prices. They will limit their exports of cattle to Germany to 6,000 head per week and of horses to 15,000 head for a period of six months after the Agreement is signed.    They will prohibit altogether the export of hides to
-Germany and restrict their exports of fish to 25,000 tons per annum.   In return they requite supplies of Chile saltpetre, tanning materials, heavy lodes and petroleum (8,000 tons).   They agree to retain only 400,000 tons deadweight of shipping for their own requirements, leaving 430,000 tons deadweight to be divided between the United States and British Shipping Authorities.   They stipulate, however, that none of the tonnage handed over to the United States shall be used in the danger zone &apos; (except for relief services) or be put into the ore trade.   They refuse to be bound by &apos; the proposed agreement for more than six months from the date of signing.   The Foreign Office has instructed Lord Reading to offer certai.ii observations tp the United States Government upon these proposals, especially as regards the disposal of Danish, tonnage. - ,   .Iceland. With reference to the proposed modification of the 1910 Agreement (see Report No. 54) with Iceland, Sir R. Paget reports that the Agreement is resented by the Danish Government, as tending to encourage the movement for separation. /German Prize stranded. The Foreign Office learns that the Spanish steamer tgoiz Mendi, under a German prize crew, stranded on February 25th east of the Skaw Lighthouse. Sir R. Paget reports the decision of the Danish Foreign Office to intern the crew ami liberate the ship and passengers. The question of the cargo is still under consideration.FINLAND.General Situation. The Foreign Office learns that Ukrainians and Poles are.&apos;,in,&apos;.&apos;, occupation of Fort Sveaborg, and that President Swinhufvud has taken refuge there. Four vessels have arrived at Vasa from Germany, containing arms and ammunition and supplies for Finnish Jagers and German, volunteers.   It is stated that the White Headquarters are iu direct wireless communication with the Germans.   The Whites have taken. Bjornehorg and Varkaus, and seem likely to be ultimately victorious&apos;.; Russian soldiers and sailors are daily leaving Helsingfors, and the Finnish Pods are growing despondent.    Under   Article -1  of the Russo-Gorman peace   terms,, all Russian troops are to be evacuated from Finland.   There is considerable danger that &apos; the Russian warships in the harbour may be captured by the Germans, owing to, the difficulty of escape or destruction.   M. Lindhagen, Mayor of Stockholm, has gone there, with the consent of the Swedish extremists, to propose mediation, and the Swedish Consul-General has been instructed to co-operate with him.   Large sums of money have been collected in Sweden and Norway with a view to the support of the , White forces against the Bolshevist wave ; it is stated that the money is to be applied to the purchase of arms in Germany.   In the Swedish Riksdag the Prime Minister,,, has pointed out that the Finnish question is a problem not only of foreign but . also of internal policy, and has observed that Conservative activism is likely to stir-up agitation in circles where the Finnish civil war is regarded as a class conflict.   He has slated that Sweden cannot undertake armed intervention unless her rights or interests are infringed.    The Swedish. Government, while permitting individuals to i volunteer, would not allow the formation, of Volunteer Corps.   Admiral Lindra.au, leader of the Conservatives, observed that if Swedes did not realise the importance -of Sweden as an independent outpost of Western culture, this importance might be appreciated in another quarter, intervention from which would draw Finland into other spheres of interest.   Such a consequence could not be to Swedeids advantage: The Intelligence Bureau points out that Mr.  Sarrio, the new Foreign Minister in the &quot;Finnish Bourgeois Government, was a member of the Delegation to Berlin, which stated that &quot; the Finnish people expected much from recognition by Germany because ;I they felt drawn to that country by a strong community of culture and interests.&quot; (He also published in Germany last year, according to Sir E. Howard, a pamphlet in favour of Finland joining Mittel Europa.)   A. further appreciation is given by a Young Finn Delegate (quoted in Reports Nos. 53 and 54) of the alternatives which may eventuate from the present position,   if the Red Guards win, anarchy will result in a nation which for 700 years has been educated in the highest respect for law.   Such a condition could only be temporary, and Finns of the better classes would welcome 1 the intervention of any foreign State.   If the White Guards von without the help of intervention, the Bourgeoisie will probably remain more or less neutral.   If they owe their success to German help they will, tend to look oh the Germans as -the saviours of -their country, and the champions of a Bourgeois regime against Socialism.   The &apos;
Finnish --soldiers&apos; who have been fighting for the Germans will not, however, wish to maintain close relations with them, still less will those who &quot;have been lighting for Russia. Moreover the feeling of the Baltic provinces is strongly against the Baltic-Barons, and the influence of the tipper class Swedish Finns is continuously declining.. If the Finns get rid of the Bolshevist tyranny ami the Baltic provinces gain a real, independence within the next 10 or 20 years, the old political triitlrwill hold good that the smaller nationalities have to look on their strongest neighbour as their worst enemy. The Foreign Office is informed that the White forces are threatened with starvation,, and that the Swedish papers are urging the despatch of a relief expedition. There is reason to believe that Germany is negotiating to supply grain in exchange for iuelal and oils. Sir lb Howard urges that, both on humanitarian and political grounds, the--Allies should immediately send a limited supply under reasonable guarantees.SPAIN.Elections. According to a Press report the results of the General Election (held on February 24th) received, up to noon, on February 26th were as follows : Scats. &quot; Seats.Liberal Democrats     - - 93 Maurist Conservatives    - .-   24Rom anon ist Liberals -        - 35 Regionalists      -         - -   34Albist Liberals         - - 25 Republicans and Reformists -   23Datist Conservatives -        - 86 Socialists          -          - GCiervist Conservatives - 30It is stated that the Republican and Reformist leaders were defeated. El Pais observes that the Republican defeat should be attributed, to the-machinations of Germanophile agents.Spanish Wheat Supply.--In order to meet the estimated wheat shortage in Spain (sec Report No. 55), the Allied Governments are facilitating the purchase by the-Spanish Government, through Allied agents, of 250,000 tons of Argentine grain, on the understanding that Spain will provide the necessary freight and finance.Coal for Spain. With reference to the question of Spanish coal supply, (see Report No;. 56), Sir A. liardinge reports that the vessels requisitioned by the Spanish Government are only sufficient to import 160,000 tons of. coal in six months, and that this coal is to be allocated to the Spanish Navy and certain railways. His Majesty&apos;s Government has decided that Spanish ships should be chartered by the Inter-allied Committee to cany coal for one month to tlie Rio Tin to Company ; and that the difference between .100s. and the market rate should lie borne by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, which, would recover from the French and United States Governments their share of the extra cost.CHINA..   Position of Government.--Sir J. Jordan reports that tlie Pekin Government is weakening, and has accepted Japanese co-operation in Eastern Serbia in order to-retain the country north of the Yangtze.   The Prime Minister has resigned, and there is again talk of a Manchu restoration.Enemy Aliens. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir C. Greene to express the hope that the Japanese Government will see its way to provide tonnage for the ideportation of enemy aliens from China to Australia. Sir J. Jordan is informing the Chinese Government that the Allies will protect Chinese interests against reprisals, at the Peace Conference. The United States Minister is giving an independent , guarantee to the same effect.PANAMA.German Intrigues. Sir C. Mallet reports risings in Panama instigated by German, influence. They have already been suppressed everywhere except at Turrialba, where also the movement is expected to collapse.
MEXICO.The Oilfields. Mr. Cummins reports a notable increase oil revolutionary activity in-the State of: Chihuahua. . The garrison (700 men) in the State of Michoacan has risen. In. Mexico City a second (see Report No. 56) garrison, of 100 men, has now revolted. Banditry is becoming frequent and widespread, and there is a growing desire amongst peaceable persons of all classes for American or other foreign occupation. Lord Beading learns that on February 21st two boats of an American oil company were attacked by about 30 armed men, who killed one American and wounded three others. There is likely to be serious difficulty in communicating with the oilfields. The United States Ambassador has been instructed, to make vigorous representations to the Mexican Government. Mr. Cummins reports that paymasters are continually being robbed, and that abuses, for which the Government forces appear to be responsible, are likely to continue; so much so that unless they are stopped, operations in the oilfields will have to be discontinued. Oaballero has been ordered by Carranza to proceed to Mexico City, but has refused. Mr. Cummins learns that he has an undertaking with Pelaez. The Foreign Office has instructed Lord Reading to express the hope to the State Department that in view of British renunciations in Latin America the United States Government will not make any agreement with Mexico which, overlooks or prejudices British interests.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.(Sec wider &quot; Allied Affairs,&quot; &quot;Norway,&quot; &quot; Sweden,&quot; &quot;Mexico,&quot; &quot;(Shipping Situation,&quot; and &quot; General.&quot;SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships lost owing to the malice of the Kings enemies during the period February 15th  21st inclusive, was 75,070 tons gross, of which 06,103 were British, as compared with 59,405 tons gross, of which 37,526 were British, reported last week.Blockade,   With regard to the system of joint control by the British and United States Governments of exports to Northern European neutrals [see Report No. 56), the War Trade Intelligence Bureau now reports that the guarantees of such neutral, associations as the Netherlands Overseas Trust will continue to be required, and all existing neutral organisations for the control of imports into neutral countries will be left as far as possible intact.Allied Goal Distribution. The British and French Governments continue to examine the question of organising and expediting the supply of coal to Italy (see Report No. 55) in such a way as may best relieve tonnage and maintain essential, stocks in France.Enemy Ships in South America. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that the United States Government (His Majesty&apos;s Government having retired in its favour) is treating with the Government of Uruguay for enemy ships in Uruguayan ports. The Peruvian Government lias intimated to the United States Government that it is prepared to cede the enemy ships in Peru provided, it is secured against reprisals by the- Central Powers. With regard to enemy ships in Chile, His Majesty&apos;s Government is negotiating with the Chilian Government, and the United States Government, with the German interests concerned. His Majesty&apos;s Government has warned the State Department that the German Government has in the past only sanctioned such negotiations in order to gain time and to obtain information of the intentions of the Allies.Transhipment and Re-export. In a Memorandum (G.T. 3679) dated February I2fch, emphasis is laid upon the necessity for stricter co-operation, between the War Trade Department and the Department of Import Restrictions, or indeed for their amalgamation. It is pointed out that some such course is clearly desirable both for economising tonnage and maintaining home supplies. Under a unified or co-ordinated system, it would be possible to ascertain the true state of affairs concerning the home4085-Jb o
supply of any given commodity, and intending importers could be put into touch with persons desiring to export the same commodities. Meanwhile a general prohibition should be placed upon, the export of all goods which are import prohibited, and upon imported raw material and certain, other goods which, haying been imported, have undergone no further process of manufacture in the United Kingdom.Imports and Industry in Relation to Shipping.- In a Report (G..T. 3706) dated February 23rd, the Board of Trade reviews recent construction, employment and losses of shipping, studies the effects of contraction of imports during 1917 and, the dangers threatened for the current year, and points out certain difficulties in the export trade.Aircraft Escorts. The Admiralty reports on the success of anti-submarine opera-tions by the Royal Naval Air Service. The monthly average number of escorts-performed during the last seven months of 1917 was 69*5 by aeroplane and 55&apos; 7 by-airship ; during fids period the monthly average number of submarines sighted, by-aircraft was 19&apos;4 and of submarines attacked by aircraft was 12; and the value of this escort work is demonstrated by the fact that up to December 19th no ship under aircraft escort had even been attacked by submarine.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. The peace terms offered by Germany to the Bolshevists harden with every military success, and some of the official messages sent by Wireless from Petrograd have been couched in piteously abject terms. The territory which they have agreed to give up covers, according to Press estimates, 435,000 square miles, with a. population, of about 55,000,000, and. access both to the Baltic and to the Black Sea.&apos; The Times of February 25th published in. full, with a clear map, the terms demanded by Germany and agreed to by the Bolshevists. A report from a reliable authority, forwarded by Mr. Lindley on February 23rd, quoted, M. Trotsky&apos;s authority for a statement that any terms would be accepted which-would give the Soviet a free hand, in Russia, and not humiliate the Soviet absolutely. In Russian Wireless of February 25th the Bolshevists plead for an armistice, point out that German troops are still advancing, and ask whether the-&quot; German Government and the High Command of the German armies will or will not &quot; reply to the expressed, consent of the People&apos;s Commissaires to sign the proposed &quot; conditions of peace.&quot; Tie mental attitude of the Bolshevists is best indicated in a report from Mr. Lindley, dated February 22nd, forwarding information that M. Trotsky&apos;s policy is based purely upon revolutionary internationalist ideas, and, that the reason, why the Bolshevists have capitulated to the Germans is to show the-German working classes that Russia really wanted peace, and that their attitude in the Brest negotiations was quite genuine. In the Petrograd Wireless manifesto of February 21st. also reported by Mr. Lindley, the peace offered by Germany and An stria-Hungary is called a &quot;peace proved to be based on. annexations and on violence,&quot; and. the advance of the German army is called, an &quot;act of brigandage.&quot; The Bolshevists further express their profound conviction, that the German proletariat will, by a rising, stop their ruling classes from suppressing the revolution in Russia.In this connection, the recent London Labour and Socialist Conference is of interest.   The attitude of the Italian and French Governments to these conferences was indicated in last weelbs Western. Report (page 11).   There has not been time as-yet to judge of the effect produced in those countries by the publication of the war -aims programme agreed to at the conference.   Lord Bertie, on &quot;February 24th,. reported the attitude of the Debats, which resents Socialist desires to take a part in. peace conferences, and to hold simultaneous conferences of their, own.   On. February 26th he quoted from an article in Yictoire by M. Ilerve wdio calls the London conference resolutions &quot;&apos;monuments of idiocy.&quot;   ML-Renaudel in Humanite supports the resolutions and criticises the attitude of the Temps.    In reply to these criticisms the Temps warns the public against bad. shepherds &quot;who would lead. France whither-the Alaximalists have led. Russia.&quot;The latest programme of war aims of the Allied Socialists was published in the Times of February 25th.   It corresponds closely with the programme previously1 The proposal to establish it slapping company in the Black Sea, controlled and financed by Germans,, should bo noted in, this connection (Western Report, No. 56, Part II., page 18).
published by the British Labour Conference. United States Socialists were not represented at the London Conference.    (Sec below.)London Labour and Socialist Conference.  Lord Bertie, on February 19th, reported a resolution of the French National Socialist Council, about International action, to be -discussed, at the London Conference. Tins resolution was passed on February 18th by 2,618 218 votes and 108 abstentions. The resolution stated that the return of -Colonies to those who had them before the war, or the exchanges or compensations to be effected, must not be obstacles to the conclusion of peace. Colonies taken from . Germany must be dealt with so that no territorial change would, deprive Germany of legitimate means of obtaining raw material and. disposing of her own products, and of having a legitimate share of economic development. The resolution reproves any &quot;Imperialistic &quot; idea which would make booty for one or more nations of the Colonies :of belligerents in tropical Africa (which comprises &quot; the entire region from north of the Zambesi to south of the Sahara &quot;). These territories are not to be exploited in the interests of capitalism, or to be used for military objects. The rights of the natives must be safeguarded, and revenues derived from each Colony must be devoted to its welfare and development. The resolution further states that the Alsace-Lorraine question is not a territorial one, but a question of right and an International problem ; without its solution, peace-will be neither just nor lasting. The Treaty must annul the &quot; brutal conquest &quot; of this Province. France can then agree to the new consulta-tion of the population concerned, which would be held under a guarantee of a Society of Nations for the liberty and sincerity of the vote taken.At the London Conference, &quot;which lasted from February 20th to 23rd, Labour and. Socialist organisations were represented from Great Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, with consultative delegates representing Socialists of South Africa, Rumania, and Southern Slavs. An. agreement was come to to adopt a programme similar to that passed by British Labour on December 28th, and to communicate it to the Socialists of enemy countries, asking for an answer. It was also decided to endeavour to obtain the representation, of Labour and of Socialism at any Peace Conference, and to send a commission to America to enlist co-operation in the programme of war aims, due programme referred to was published in full, with a useful precis, in the Times of February 2oth. The liberation of Belgium and of all peoples annexed by force is placed in the forefront. All attempts to transform a defensive war into a war of -conquest will be resisted. A. League of Nations is pressed for, as proposed by President Wilson, and the right of &quot; self-determination &quot; is made the sole ground for territorial readjustments. -The last excuse for &quot;strategic protections&quot; is held to be removed, by the prospective establishment of a League of Nations. Colonies taken by conquest must be the subject of special consideration at the Peace Conference. (The Labour Conference of December 28th proposed to hand over those in tropical Africa to a League of Nations, and neutralise them permanently as a single independent. African State.   See cdso under Part I., &quot; German Colonies in Africa.&quot;)Russia. Russian Wireless of February 21th announced that the Bolshevist Delegation to the new Peace Conference was leaving Petrograd for Brest-Litovsk at 8 p.m. Their probable attitude there may be gathered from the summary given under the General heading above, but an indication of. the rapid changes of attitude of the Bolshevists is given in the following two extracts from typical reports recently received.: (1) &quot;An appeal of the Highest commander-in-Chief,&quot; signed by Krylenko, was issued by Russian Wireless &quot; To All Comrades and Citizens &quot; in the following-words on February 22nd : -&quot; The Council of the People&apos;s Commissaries has already declared its unalterable -decision to resist to the last the plundering raid of the capitalists of the German Government, &amp;c.&quot;(2) On the same day German Wireless reports a speech by von iviihlmann in the Reichstag announcing the receipt by the German Government of a Wireless message from Petrograd which he attributes to &quot; the renewed advance of the German Army.&quot; The message runs&quot; ddie Council of the National Commissaries finds itself obliged, in view of the situation which has been created, to declare its willingness to sign, peace on the1985 17; U
conditions which, were put forward by the delegations of the Quadruple Alliance at Brest-Litovsk, &amp;c.&quot;The latest telegrams quoting M. Trotsky&apos;s views received from Mr. Lindley on February 26th contain the words &quot;Russia will accept the&apos;German terms until the German proletariat overthrows those representatives of militarism and capitalism enforcing them,&quot; and point out the impossibility of a genuine peace being made by-parties as different as the Bolshevists and the Germans.Ukraine. Mr. Bagge on February 1.0th reported the contents of an army order of February .1.5th, in which an endeavour is made to justify the conclusion of peace with Germany, on the plea that German capitalists and landowners were supported by the fact that the bourgeoisie of England and France had remained silent.Rumania. Sir W. Townley (February 22nd) and Lord Bertie (February 23rd&quot;) report that von Kiihlmann and Count Czernin are meeting the Rumanian Prime-Minister. Lord Bertie gathers that it is &quot;improbable that the Germans wish to depose-the present King, or press for the army to be demobilised, and that General Avcrescu would not accept humiliating conditions. Sir G. Barclay (Feb. 23rd) indicates the probability of German terms being accepted if they are not humiliating.Germany. Important details, furnished by Sir W. Townley, are given under the heading of. GERMANY (on page 3), about the recent change of attitude in that country towards peace discussions, and the reasons for that change. German Wireless of February 20th-22nd gives a report of von Kiihlmanhs speech in the Reichstag on the treaty made with the Ukraine. He stated clearly that the economic advantages to be obtained influenced the decisiou to conclude this treaty: &quot; Ukraine is a rich &quot; land, and economic relations were of decided significance for the conclusion of &quot; peace. . . Ukrainia, as may be credibly assumed, possesses even now, after such a &quot; long war, considerable stores of bread, corn, as well as other foodstuffs, part of &quot; iclrich site is in a position to hand over.&quot; In the course of his speech von Ivuhlmann threw an interesting light upon the German attitude towards treaties in general in the words, &quot; according to experiences in diplomatic life, available treaties serve &quot; more or less (sic) as foundations for later incidents. . . .&quot; There was a general tendency of representatives of all parties, except Poles and Minority Socialists, to rejoice, almost to gloat, upon the economic advantages so obtained by the German military dominance over Russia,German Wireless of February 22nd reports that von Kiihlmann left Berlin on the 21st for Bucharest to negotiate with the Rumanians. [Count Hertling has subsequently announced that von Kuhlmann will goon to the Brest Conference with, the Bolshevists.] The Main Committee of the Reichstag has approved both the Peace Treaty with the Ukraine and the Supidementary Treaty (see last week&apos;s Western Report, page 12), both of which had already been approved by the Bundersrat.On February 24th Sir W. Townley quotes at length from an article in the Vossisehe (February 23rd) in which an attempt is made to. make capital.out of Lord. MilnePs Plymouth speech on war aims, only extracts from the speech being given. The Vovwdrts of the same date protests against the rudenesses (Grobheiton) attached to the speech by the Wolff Bureau, and suggests that the Chancellor in his Budget speech should make good the clumsiness of his subordinates.A full account of the speech delivered by Count Hertling in the Reichstag on February 25th has now been published by German Wireless (February 20th). In its-general features, it appears to be an attempt to sow discord between the nations opposing the avowed German policy of attacking and conquering neighbouring nations in order to obtain economic advantages. The essence of the speech is contained in the words &quot; Our war aims from the beginning have been the defence of&quot; &quot; the Fatherland, the maintenance of our territorial integrity, and the freedom of our &quot; economic development in every direction.&quot; Count Hertling makes no attempt to explain how any of these German interests were in danger at the time when German armies crossed the Belgian frontier in August 1914. A more detailed review of lRs speech wdll be given in an appendix to next week&apos;s report. Sir E. Howard on February 25th sends a report from a reliable source that the German Government means to delay the army&apos;s offensive, in order to see first what effect will be produced by the Chancellor^ speech.Austria-Hungary. German Wireless of February 25th reports that &quot;Ambassador-von Merey &quot; will go to the peace negotiations with the Bolshevists at Brest, as the-
loPlenipotentiary of Austria-Hungary. Sir W. Townley, on February 20th, reported, on the authority of the Dutch Press, news, claimed to have been derived from Vienna officially, that Count Czernin was,going to Rumania, which country had asked for peace. The official impression in Vienna was that Rumania will go on fighting unless she can obtain her object. It is considered improbable that the Ukraine will give up Bessarabia unless she gets the Cholm district, but on the other hand she wants peace so much that she may renounce any claims in order to obtain it. On February 24th he reported a speech by Dr. Wekerle in the Hungarian Chamber emphasising the point that the Ukraine Treaty will only remain in operation if all the clauses are fulfilled ; the failure to fulfil only one renders the whole Treaty invali cl.Great Britain: Bolshevist Propaganda. -Mr. Lindley was informed by the Foreign Office on February 2 Is v., with reference to Mr. Betroff, of our objections to allowing an agitator to come to this country after having been compelled in self-defence to keep him interned for two years. Other countries would be compelled to take a similar course.On February 21st the Foreign Office asked Mr. Lindley in future to send the names of Bolshevists wanting to come to England, before adding a visa to their passports. This condition is not intended to apply to couriers of whom the bona-jides is established.With reference to former allusions in Western Reports to the movements of MM. Litvinoff, Kameneff, and Saalkind, the War Cabinet have further considered the question of Bolshevist propaganda, and have instructed the Home Secretary as to the action to be taken in-the matter. MM. Kameneff and Saalkind arrived in this country on February 23rd.The Ministry of Labour reported that, during the week ending on February 20th, unrest in the industrial world had perceptibly contiuued to abate, and that less interest in war aims was displayed in the Labour and Socialistic Fress. The proposal to hold an International Conference continued to attract consideration, but criticism would remain indefinite until the proposals of the Allied Socialists assume a more concrete character. (See above for the programme actually adopted at the London Conference.)GENERALAnglo-Turkish Convention. Sir H. Rumbold learns that the delay in-the ratifica-tion of the Berne Convention has been caused by the absence from Constantinople of the Grand Vizier, who has now returned, and is expected to execute its stiprxlations. Enver Pasha, who was acting in his place, maintained a hostile attitude towards the agreement.Civilians from Germany for Internment in Holland. Sir W. Townley reports that the Germans, in sending civilians to Holland for internment, take away their passports at the frontier, so that they cannot establish their identity. He suggests that such persons should in future bring to Holland passports from the Dutch Minister in Berlin. It would also appear that the Germans select a large number of undesirables for internment in Holland, whose nationality cannot be established without passports.Dropping of Pamphlets by Airmen. The Foreign Office has addressed to Berlin, through the Dutch authorities, a number of questions concerning the treatment of Lieutenants Scholtz-and Wookey, who have been imprisoned for dropping pamphlets.Zionist Medical Unit. Zionists in the United States have requested permission to send to Palestine a medical unit consisting of 25 persons fully equipped. His Majesty&apos;s Government has intimated its approval, subject to recognition of the unit by the United States Government.
