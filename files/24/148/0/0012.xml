SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACH 10)   WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No.  61.part ii. foreign and general.Peace Discussions.There is a temporary lull in the clamour of peace discussion, whilst all countries await the issue of the great struggle for the mastery on the Western front, where our enemies are lighting desperately for a &quot; German &apos;: peace.M. Petrolf, the Russian delegate, has announced by wireless that he is remaining in Berlin because the treaty with Russia, though ratified by the Reichstag, has not yet been signed.The treaty of peace now being forced upon the Rumanians is said, to include further humiliating terms to enable German capitalists to exploit the petroleum deposits, ignoring both the sovereign rights of the State and the private rights of the individual. This is one of the most definite examples of the use of the German sword to promote the economic deA-development in every direction, which Count Hertling recently confessed to have been the German war aim &quot;from the beginning.&quot;Italy.A conference of the Italo-Slav entente Committees is expected to take place shortly in Rome, with the approval of the Italian Premier.Enemy Allied and German Internal Affairs.The possible influence of the situation in Austria-Hungary upon German policy merits attention. The present great German effort to force a conclusion in the held has been attributed on good authority to this influence, and reports from several sources agree that urgent demands for peace are being made by the people of Austria-Hungary. Recent Bolshevist successes in the Black Sea littoral may produce an effect on the situation, if truly reported.Netherlands.Indignation with the Allies over the shipping question is being freely expressed.Sweden.An account is given of the Swedish PremiePs important speech of March 20th.

part ii.--foreign and general.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Far East: Question of Intervention. The Foreign Office continues to receive conflicting information as to the desirability of intervention in the Far East. Some reports indicate the possible formation of a Red Army, which might carry on obstructive guerilla operations against the Germans, conditionally upon Japanese inaction. In this connection may be noted the reports of Bolshevist successes against the Germans on the Black Sea Littoral. It is stated that a measure of technical and material assistance would be accepted from Great Britain, France and the United States; and such an arrangement might later result in an invitation of Allied military co-operation. Others contend that the Bolshevists are essentially inter-nationalists rather than patriots ; that they distrust the Allies as much as the Germans ; and that a truer expression of Russian opinion may be hopefully awaited from some such body as a revived Constituent Assembly in Russia or Siberia. Mean-while, the continuance of unsettled conditions is said to be compelling the more orderly elements to look to the advancing Germans for restoration of social and economic stability ; in this connection the case of Finlaud is mentioned as analogous It appears to be common ground that any intervention should be directed solely against German aggression, dissociated from any partisanship in Russian internal affairs, and preferably based upon some sort of Russian mandate.Allied Labour. Mr. Bayley reports a public declaration by Mr. Gompers that in no circumstances could American Labour be represented at an International Beace Conference, at which representatives of the Central Powers attended (and see Report No. 60).Raw Materials. The Committee on the Trade Relations of the United. Kingdom within the Empire has issued two Reports (G.T. 4015), classifying raw materials produced in the Empire, and discussing the question of their control (and see Report No. 59).ITALY.Itcdo-Slav Entente. The Intelligence Bureau distinguishes the three principal. Committees now working in connection with the Italo-Slav Entente. They are :   (I) The General Committee for the Liberation of the suppressed Peoples of Austria. This Committee has its headquarters in Rome; (2) the International Socialist Committee, presided over by M. Albert Thomas, with headquarters in Paris ; (3) a Committee recently formed in Italy for the preparation of an understanding between Italy and the Jugoslavs. This Committee is of a predominantly Radical character, and comprises all the most prominent opponents of the claims to Dalmatia ; whereas the Rome Committee is of a mixed character and contains a considerable element of the Parliamentary Right. Dr. Andrea Torre (Deputy, President of the Press Association and formerly Foreign Editor of the Gorriere della Sera), acting as repre-sentative of the Rome Committee, has already agreed in London with Dr. Ante Trumbic (President of the London J ugoslav Committee) upon certain principles recognised by both parties. A general conference will shortly take place in Rome, with the approval of the Italian Premier, and it is possible that representatives of the Allied countries will be invited to attend.ALBANIA.Central Powers and Albania. The following is extracted from Prince Lichnowsky&apos;s Memorandum (see under &quot; German Internal Affairs &quot;) : &quot; In Greece to-day whole groups are Albanian, and the so-called Greek national dress is of Albanian origin.   The amalgamation of the preponderating orthodox and
Islamite Albanians with the Greek State was, therefore, the best solution and the I most natural, if one leaves out of account Scutari and the northern part of Serbia and Montenegro. His Majesty was also in favour of this solution on dynastic grounds. When I encouraged the Monarch by letter to this effect, I received violent reproaches from the Chancellor for voting for Austria&apos;s opponents, and he forbade all such I interference in the future, and even direct correspondence. We had eventually, 1 however, to abandon the tradition of carrying out the Triple Alliance policy in the East, and to acknowledge our mistake, which consisted in identifying ourselves with ; the Turks in the south and the A ustro-Magyars in the north ; for the continuance of that policy, which we began at the Congress in Berlin, and subsequently carried on I zealously, was bound in time most probably, should the necessary skill in conducting it fail, to lead to a collision with Russia and a world Avar.&quot;ENEMY&quot; ALLIED AFFAIRS.Austrian Internal Conditions. Arbeiler Zeitung of March 17th reports a Conference Jield on March loth in Vienna between Austrian Labour Deputies and the Cabinet. All the Ministers took part, and the Food Controller also. The Deputies described the difficulties and inconveniences in the food service and the excitement prevalent amongst the working classes. In particular, attention was drawn to the fact that any farther curtailing of the potato and food rations would make conditions past bearing for the masses. They stated that, in consequence of underfeeding, the working classes were so weakened that they could not stand the strain of the over-long hours imposed, nor could they do night shifts or answer the requirements of the masters, who clamoured always for more and yet more work. The overwork to which the population was subject was the less to be justified because all the time workmen were being dismissed. Railway workshop hands and train service personnel complained of their low wages, which compared most unfavourably with wages of other classes. The excitement amongst the population was kept alive and made ever juore intense by the fact that hopes of an early end to the war were constantly being-damped. The working classes knew that all. the measures taken, to relieve the hideous poverty of masses could do no lasting good. They were persuaded that only one thing could really help, namely, a speedy general peace. (And see under &quot; German Internal. Affairs.&quot;)Austria and the German Alliance. It is stated in Kreuzzeilung, and corroborated by Dr. Fried jung in Neuen Werner Tagehlatt, and Bernhard in Vossische Zeitung, that Dr. Lammasch, a well-known Vienna Professor, having influence with the Emperor Karl, proposed in 1917 that the Austro-German Alliance should be dissolved after the war. He is now reported, to have expressed his opinion in the Upper House that a declaration to that effect would be the best way for Austria to obtain peace at once with England and France. Vorwaerls declares that there is no mistaking the fact that in Austria the enemies of the German Alliance are steadily increasing. &quot; It is a very serious fact which, should not be without influence on Germany&apos;s policy.&quot; Sir H. Rumbold learns that the German Government has protested against the ProfessoFs observations, and that the A us tro- Hungarian Government and the Emperor have repudiated his views and expressed their regrets.Austria and the Poles. With regard to the recent unexpected abstention of the Polish members from voting against the Austrian Budget, the fntelligence Bureau notes the probability that this course of action was due to the intervention of the Magyars. The Magyar interests are contrary to those of the Czechs and of the Ukrainians Slovaks inhabit North-Western, Ukrainians North-Eastern Hungary. The Magyars, therefore, naturally do not want to see the Poles join hands with the Czechs in the Austrian Parliament; and an East-Galicia under Polish dominion is, for them, the best safeguard against the Ukrainian irredentists.TFar Costs. The Austrian Minister of Finance, Dr. Popovics, in his Budget speech, according to the Neue Freie Presse (February 23rd), said that the costs of the war to the end of 1917 were Kr. 19 milliards, that the interest on the second half-year of the sixth war loan and of the seventh Avar loan was not coArered, and that the revenue from excess profits Avpuld be less than estimated. The result was. that Kr. 325 milliards new money must be raised by a well-secured war loan.   The Minister ended
by saying that some increase of taxation was inevitable.   [Daily Review.   Economic Supplement, March 19th.JAustro-llungarian Postal Air Services to Russia, Rumania and Turkey. According to a Wolff telegram from Vienna to the Essener Allgemeine Zei uvg of March 21st, an Air Service is about to be established between Vienna and Kiev, with stops at Cracow and Lemberg. Also an Air Service from Budapest via Bucharest to Odessa, and possibly to Constantinople, will lie organised. This service will be primarily established for postal communication between the Central Authorities and Count Fdrgacids Mission, which is organising and supervising the transport of grain from Ukrainia to Austria-Hungary.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Germany and Austria. The&apos; foreign Office has received information indicating that the present German offensive is dictated by the serious internal situation of Austria, which is stated to be on the verge of revolution, and that Germany is prepared to make colossal sacrifices in the hope of enforcing an early peace. Meanwhile the Prussian Government has taken steps to control communications between Bavaria and Austria or Switzerland.Germany and Russia. The Foreign Office has received, information to the effect that the Germans have proposed to evacuate certain of the occupied Russian districts on condition that Russia desists from action contrary to German interests. &apos; Another report suggests that Germany may decide to occupy Petrograd and Afoscow, establish a Monarchy, and then propose a general peace, claiming credit for the suppression of the Bolshevist menace to Europe.Germany and Poland. The Intelligence Bureau reports that M. Steczkowski, Minister of Finance in the Cabinet of M. Kucharzewski, has undertaken the formation of a new Bolish Calji.net. after arranging in Berlin for a close Polish-German Alliance. Germany is to abandon all idea of &quot; frontier rectification &quot; at the expense of Poland,&apos; the question of Cholm is to lie &quot; carefully considered,&quot; and. Poland is to receive a wide extension into White Russia. In exchange she is to subordinate herself entirely to Germany in military and economic matters. The masses in Poland, are, however, by no means favourable to an alliance with the Central Powers.Conditions in Western Industrial Districts. Sir W. Townley learns that in the Western industrial districts discontent is growing owing to reduced bread rations. The people arc declaring that as the Government is unable to deliver grain to Holland,, where it is imperative to remedy the present economic situation, it is evident that the quantities announced as coming from Ukrainia must have been greatly exaggerated. The treatment of Russians in the West is stated to be shocking. When remonstrated with on the plea that peace had now been signed the Germans remained indifferent saying that the Russians must stay and work under present conditions till the end of die war.   Signs are not wanting that the Russians will not submit.Arrest [of Minority Socialists. A. Leipzig telegram appearing in the Kblnische (March 21st) says that the President of the Leipzig Independent Social Democratic Party, Richard Lipiuski, has been arrested on suspicion of having participated in the circulation of strike leaflets. A. number of other Independent Socialist members of the party, including three Leipzig Municipal Councillors, have already been arrested on similar grounds.German Responsibility for the War. The Berne correspondent of llumanile reports that at a secret sitting of the Reichstag Commission on March 16th the Socialists produced a memorandum by Victor Muelhen, former Assistant Director of Krupps, stating that from a conversation with two important personages in the beginning of July 1914, he became convinced that the German Government was then resolved upon war. The memorandum formally accuses the Kaiser of having provoked the war and calls upon Helfferich, Jagow, and Krupp as witnesses. A. memorandum privately circulated by Prince Lichnowsky, late German Ambassador in London, has been published by the Stockholm Politiken (the text is set out in the Daily Review of the Foreign Press of March 19th, 21st, and 22nd, and the Times of March 28th). Substantially, the document illustrates the persistently aggressive policy of Germany as contrasted with the conciliatory attitude of Great Britain, and the clear responsibility of the former for the war.   The disclosures were debated in the Reichstag on
March 20th, and laboriously explained away by Vice-Chancellor. von Payer. Oh March 23rd a long exculpation by von Jagow of German foreign policy appeared in&apos; the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. (These apologias appeal&apos; in German Wireless Press of March 21st and 25th.) It is reported that the Prince has resigned his Ambassadorial rank, ddie Deutsche Tageszeitung characterises his action as high treason, ddie Mannheim Volhsstiinine observes : &quot; Of two theories only one is&apos; possible, &quot; either Prince hichiiowsky is the most incurable idiot who ever sat in the. &quot; Ambassadors chair, or else not a shred remains of the fiction that the outbreak of &quot; war was due to English intrigues.&quot; vorwarts says : &quot;It may help to teach people &quot; in Germany again to think somewhat more calmly and open-mindedly about &quot; England. The man who was sent to England by the German Government to watch &quot; English policy, report upon, and beep touch with it, has given absolutely brilliant &quot; testimony regarding it. This virtue will certainly not evoke a desire on our part &quot; to be defeated by England (we know too well /what we should have to expect from &quot; a victorious England after -nearly four. years of war), but it assuredly shakes the &quot; idea that Germauj&apos; could only continue to exist on the ruins of the British world &quot; empire.&quot;German Finances. The Daily lievicw of the Foreign Press (Economic Supple-ment) of March 1.9th gives an analysis of the German Imperial Budget Estimates for 1918, and particulars in regard to the National Debt and the Seventh War Loan. A telegram from Berlin states that the Reichstag has passed the war credits of lb milliards of marks, the Independent Socialists alone voting against it.And see under &quot; Enemy Allied Affairs.&quot;NETHERLANDS.Requisitioning of Dutch Tonnage. ddie British and United States Governments have notified the Netherlands Government that, in view of its delay in approving the draft agreement accepted by its delegates in January; and its inability, on account of German, pressure, to carry out the modus mvendi then agreed upon, they have found themselves obliged to requisition the services of Dutch, ships in British and United States ports. It is pointed out that this action is taken in exercise of unquestioned sovereign right, and upon terms which, apart from German intimidation, would have been, sure of acceptance. Ample tonnage is left to Holland for her domestic and Colonial requirements ; facilities will lie given to the Dutch Colonial trade ; Dutch ships may proceed at once to America to receive 100,000 tons of breadstuffs placed at the disposal of the Netherlands Government, and such ships will be freely bunkered and free from, detention. Meanwhile, the S.S. New Amsterdam, now in New York, will be permitted to proceed immediately to Holland with a cargo of rice and coffee. Liberal compensation will be paid to the owners of the requisitioned ships (for vessels used in the war zone, 35s. per ton per month, as already paid to Danish and Norwegian owners), and suitable provision will be made to meet the possibility of their being lost through enemy action ; the Associated Governments are even prepared to offer an option for the replacement after the war of ships lost in the existing danger zone. Sir W. Townley reports that much indignation is being expressed on the subject by the Dutch Government, Press and public, ddie V aderland, however, appreciates the moderate and practical tone of the British note; and the Nieuwe Rolterdamsehe Gourant quotes high German authority as recognising the right of angary (and see Report No. 60 under &quot; Shipping Situation &quot;).Netherlands and Centred Powers. ddie Foreign Office learns that on February 27th the Netherlands Foreign Office appointed a Commission to investigate the basis upon which economic relations between the Netherlands and the Central Powers should be regulated at the termination on March 31st of the present agreement. The German Government is now stated to have qualified its concessions (mentioned in Report No. 60) in regard to Dutch sailings, by conditions prohibiting the sale of Dutch ships, and giving Germany the right to control the passengers and cargoes of ships which are allowed free passage ; such ships are to be allowed German bunker coal to tho first enemy port of call. Repairs to shipping, which require German iron or steel, are required to be under full German control.SWITZERLAND.Loan Negotiations. Sir H. Rumbold reports the signature of the Swiss-British Loan   Agreement.    The Swiss  Government has waived the economic provisions5257-B
originally contended for, and the Agreement is based upon financial stipulations only. Its duration is to be for 10 months from April 1st, terminable as from November 30th, on two.months&apos; notice from either side. Under its terras, subject to a minimum monthly arrival of 20,000 tons of goods in European ports, advances, to a monthly maximum of 10,000,000 francs, will be made proportioned on a sliding scale to the amount imported. Interest will be at 5 per cent, per annum, plus -I- per cent, per quarter. The Swiss Government declares that 70,000 tons of goods are the monthly minimum essential for Swiss requirements. The British Government promises monthly chartering licences up to 50,000 tons of goods (representing about 78,000 tons deadweight), but does not guarantee that such tonnage will be available. The British Government also undertakes to withdraw its proposed prohibition upon import of Swiss goods.Food Supply. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the cereal stocks in Switzerland will, at the outside, last until the end of May. There is at present a serious shortage of supplies.under the American-Swiss Agreement. (See Reports Nos. 49-51, 53, 55, 58, and 59.) According to a Press report, the Federal Council, has claimed compensation in Berlin for the torpedoing of the Spanish S.S. Sardi.iw.ro, which was carrying a cargo of grain for Switzerland.   (See Report No. 58.)Cotton Exports. Sir II. Rumbold reports the measures taken by the Swiss Government to ration or prohibit various classes of cotton exports, and suggests that these now justify the raising of the Allied embargo. (See Reports Nos. 51, 52, 53, 55, and 59.)NORWAY.Norwegian Declaration of Neutrality. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir M. Findiay to reply, in acknowledgment of the Norwegian declaration of neutrality (see Report No. 59), that His Majesty&apos;s Government understands such declaration to connote the intention of the Norwegian Government to maintain all the rights of Norway as a neutral State.Spitsbergen. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Bertie to invite the attention.&quot;of the French Government to a clause in the German-Russian Peace Treaty, which appears to indicate the intention of Germany to secure a seat on the Spitsbergen Commission when the administration of the islands comes to be discussed after the war. If she were then able to influence the decision of the Russian representative, the interests of Norway and Sweden would probably be overridden. (And see Report No. 60, under &quot; Norway &quot; and &quot;Finland.&quot;)SWEDEN.Speech by Swedish Premier. Sir-E. Howard reports a public speech made by the Swedish Premier on March 20th. He declared that the present time was the most critical since the outbreak of war, especially for Sweden. Owing to the disintegration of Russia, the establishment of a German protectorate or sovereignty over the Russian Baltic States, and the entry of Finland into this German union, Sweden was faced with problems of external policy of a far-reaching kind. The internal situation was also very grave, especially regarding food supply. The position was aggravated by the irresponsibility of the Opposition Press in attacking the Government on most delicate questions of foreign policy. The idea that SwedeiPs passivity threw Finland into the arms of Germany was quite groundless. Finland had asked help from Germany and Sweden simultaneously. He could not publicly discuss the relations previously existing between Germany and Finland, but he main-tained emphatically that Finland, never regarded Germany as a second string-to her bow, but as her main helper. Could Sweden hope to oust such a - competitor, and how would Germany have tolerated it if she had ? As an ally of Germany in Finland, Sweden would have fallen into the same state of dependence as Finland. With regard to Aland, the Swedish Government could not use Swedish troops there to force an immediate decision as to the ownership of the islands, as suggested by the Conservatives, because it would not take advantage of FinlaiuPs present distressed position, and because of the complex international
problems involved. The - commercial policy of the Government was to maintain relations with both belligerent camps. Consideration must be given to Germany&apos;s sensitiveness as to the cession oi tonnage to the Entente, but the Entente was equally sensitive regarding Swedehs unlimited ore export to Germany. No neutral power-had lately succeeded in making so favourable an agreement as the modus vivendi. The main agreement would give Sweden about 1,000,000 tons of valuable foodstuffs, and commodities ; if satisfactory terms could be arranged, it would be folly to give xrp this certainly for the possibility of something from the Ukraine. In conclusion, the Premier pointed out that Sweden could not prevent alterations in the balance of power on the Baltic. All she could do was to accommodate herself to it. Sweden hoped for friendly relations with Germany, but not at the cost of national independence. Close association of the Scandinavian States was more important than ever, and also association with Finland and other Baltic States and Poland ; but Sweden could not limit herself to Baltic interests ; never was it more necessary to keep open the path to the AVest, as only thereby could Sweden and her- neighbours jointly maintain the independence of the North.   (And see under &quot;Finland.&quot;)Swedish Negotiations. Sir E. Howard reports that German threats and the initial success of the German, offensive are encouraging the Press campaign against the proposed Agreement with the Allies (see Reports Nos. 58-60). The example of Holland (see Report No. 60 under &quot; Shipping Situation &quot;) is being held up for imitation.DENMARK.Danish-German Negotiations. Mr-. Gurney reports a statement that an agreement has been concluded, between the Danish and German Governments regarding the exchange of commodities for the months April to July inclusive. The quantity and. price of imported German; coal will remain the same, and imports of German, iron and steel, partly for use in shipbuilding, will be somewhat increased. Salt and akali are also to be supplied by Germany and benzine by Austria, and certain other industrial and technical raw materials will also be provided. The prices for Danish agricultural produce continue substantially the same, with some increases, chiefly regarding meat. The arrangement does not cover the question of saltpetre.Butter. -The Foreign Office informs Mr. Gurney that an extra charge of 10 kroner per ton is to be made to Danish buyers upon all cargoes of coal, coke and patent fuel shipped after March 24th, under contracts &quot;made on or after October 15th, 1917. Such charge will not be payable to the exporter, but is to be accounted for, under a prescribed arrangement, direct to His Majesty&apos;s Government. This scheme will make it possible to bargain with the Danish Government on the subject of butter-prices. (See Report No. 58.) Meanwhile the Foreign Office instructs Mr. Gurney to open negotiations for purchase of Danish butter to a specified amount at the rate now offered by the Danish Government, on the basis that licences wiU be issued for the export to Denmark of a certain quantity of sewing cotton.   (See Report No. 59.)And see under &quot;Shipping Situation.&quot;FINLAND (and ALAND).Conditions in Finland. The Foreign Office learns that the Red movement is on the verge of collapse. Its finances are practically exhausted. Red Guards have broken into the Nordiska Bank, which contains funds belonging to His Majesty&apos;s Government. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Helsingfors has lodged a strong protest. The financial ruin of the country is threatened ; famine is imminent and, if there is further fighting, will continue for twu years owing to the impossibility of spring sowing. It is now stated to be untrue that the Germans have promised Finland 15,000 tons of wheat (see Report No. 59). The Reds and Whites will not negotiate direct, but the Reds would certainly, and the Whites probably, welcome Swedish intervention. The prospect of German political and economic ascendancy alarms the majority of Finns, Avho&apos;Avould prefer union with Scandinavia. That section of the population which wordd prefer neutrality to German tutelage, is pressing for foodstuffs from England, and America as the- only means to independence.   The Foreign Office has instructed Sir E. Howard that His Majesty&apos;s
Government might he prepared to consider an exchange of Finnish goods in Sweden against Russian goods in Finland, conditional on the prior return of the latter to Sweden.Transit Goods in Finland. Sir E. Howard reports, however, that the transit goods lying in Finland (see Report No. 59) are regarded by the Finnish authorities as Russian property, and the metals have been sold to German agents, who are trying to obtain horse transport from Sweden, probably in order to convey the goods to the Finnish railway. Sir E. Howard, has pointed out to the Swedish Foreign Office that the export of horses and hay from. Sweden is prohibited, and. has also taken steps to prevent the despatch of hay from Norway. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau observes that the Finnish Government may at any moment requisition the military material and send it to Germany in return for German assistance. The Finnish White Guards have already arranged to consign to Germany 1,000 tons of copper, recently removed from one of the supply depots of the Russian Fleet.Finland and Germany. Dag ens Nyheler reproduces an interview with M. Svinhufvud, President of the Finnish. Senate, published in the Berliner Tageblall, in the course of which he is reported as saying that &quot; it was specially &quot; hoped to develop economic relations with Germany ; that Finland had always been &quot; the most pro-German country ; that at the beginning of the war Finns said that &quot; German.y&apos;s victory was their victory, and if Germany lost.Finland&apos;s cause would &quot; be for ever lost.&quot; M, Swinhufvud. has now arrived in Stockholm from Berlin, and has stated to the Press that while in Berlin, he gave no interviews intended for publication. Sir E. Howard reports a statement that 20,000 Germans have dis-. embarked, on the Finnish mainland.German]/, Finland and a, Northern Port, German Wireless of March 21st reports that in an interview with the representative of the Taegliche Ihindschau, M. Hjelt, the new Finnish Ambassador in Berlin, declared: &quot;We wish for an access to the &quot; Arctic Ocean through, the so-called Ostkarelien. The excitement of the Norwegian &quot; newspapers is completely superfluous. We shall, not require Norwegian territory, &quot; but a portion, of that which still belongs to Russia. In reality it belongs to us 15 already since the Russian Government promised us that outlet to the Arctic Ocean. &quot; when Finland 30 years ago ceded to Russia strips of the frontier. But Russia &quot; naturally has not kept her word and has not fulfilled her pledge. The fulfilment of &quot; Finnish wishes would be attainable by negotiations between the Finnish and &quot; Russian Republic, perhaps on the basis of mutual compensation.&quot; The claims of Finland to Russian Karelia and the Kola Peninsula are set forth in the Finnish official paper, Valkoinen Suomi, of 20th March. Sir M. Findiay reports that much anxiety is being caused in Norway by Finnish aspirations for a port in the North. According to a Norwegian Government organ (March 20th) Norwegian opinion is united against the idea of any cession of Norwegian territory. The frontier treaty concluded between Norway and Russia in 1826 must be observed (and see Report No. 60, under &apos;,&apos;Finland &quot; and &quot; Norway&quot;).Allied Representatives. With reference to the guarantee of the Finnish Government regarding immunity of Allied Consuls, the Foreign Office instructs Sir E. Howard to point out that this has been already violated by the arrest of Yice-Consul Fawcett, and to press for his immediate liberation.   He is now reported to be still at Eckero.Aland. [In Report No. 60, under Finland, subheading Aland, at fourth line from end of paragraph, the word fortified (based on an error in telegraphic transmission) shotild read unfortified.]Mastery of the Baltic. The Times of March 27th devotes a column (page 4) to &quot; The Mastery of the Baltic.&quot;   (And see under &quot; Sweden.&quot;)SPAIN.Strike of Postal and Telegraphic Employees : New Cabinet.  Sir A. Hardinge reports the continuation until March 23rd of disorganisation in the postal and telegraphic services (see Report No. 60).   On March 20th, a compromise was effected, as the
result of which the Minister of War resigned, and the Premier thereupon tendered the resignation of the Cabinet. Madrid papers of March&apos; 22nd announce that after numerous consultations a new Cabinet was on that date formed as follows : Premier: Senor Maura. War: General Marina.Foreign Affairs: Sen or Date. Marine : Admiral Pidal.Justice : Count Romanones. Public instruction : Seifor Alba.Interior : Sehor Garcia Prieto. Public Works : Senor Cambo. Finance : Senor Gonzalez Besacla.It is stated that great popular enthusiasm is shown for the new Administration, and that the King&apos;s conduct of the negotiations is much applauded. The Post and Telegraph Unions are reported to have decided to yield and to rely for satisfaction of their claims on the action of Parliament. A. decree has been published revoking the militarisation of the services. The dangers of an autocratic regime, which (as the Intelligence Bureau points out) might have been anticipated from Ciervist. influence, are apparently obviated by bis omission from the Cabinet.German Submarine interned. Sir A, llardinge reports that the German Submarine U.B. 48 entered Ferrol on Alarch 23rd in a damaged condition and has been interned.German Aims and, Methods in, Spain. The following is the substance of a review of German intrigues in Spain, published in Espana of March 7th : &quot; German policy in Spain revolves round two main objects : to avert the possibility of a rupture of diplomatic relations with Germany, and to prevent trade with the Allies. With, these objects in view the following five forces have been mobilised :   (I.) The car lists, (2) the Germanophil sympathies of the Army, (3) the subsidised Press, (4) Democratic elements gained by bribery, (5) the Anarchists and Syndicalists.&quot;(1) The car lists. The car lists, from hatred of free-thinking and Republican Prance and Protestant and anti-Carlist England, are the natural allies of Germany. The incubus of a Carlist civil Avar weighs far more heaAuly on the minds of Spanish Governments than is generally believed. They are aware that consignments of Portuguese rifles have been acquired, by the Carbsts. The shadow of the old blood-thirsty Carl ism is one of the factors which has most influenced the policy of neutrality at all costs adopted by our Governments.&quot;(2) The Army. A section of the Army is Germanophil from conviction. It admires the military power of Germany, which it believes to be in vincible. These spontaneous sympathies have been extended and organised by the Germans in Spain. These individual sympathies have been converted into a collective force, so much so that a military journal was permitted to make the memorable and astounding remark that the Spanish Army would wage civil Avar rather than engage in. a foreign one. This threat Avas too serious not to affect the Government. Then came the Committees of Defence to distract public attention from the war and to deprive the civil powers of the necessary energy and. authority to take up a decided attitude in. the various international, questions which were pressing upon Spain ; whatever their origin, it must be admitted that these Committees were not favourable to Spain at a moment when the subordination of the Army to the civil authority was more necessary than ever to enable the latter to cope with the constant aggressions of Germany. They drew attention from the submarine outrages, and deprived the Government of power, by the threat of civil Avar in the event of a rupture with the Central Empires. It is not known Avhether the Germans exercised a direct influence over the Army, but it is certain that the influence owing to general propaganda was a Avi.de one.&quot; (3) The Subsidised Press. The friendly but independent papers were not con-sidered sufficient, so a Press Avas founded with instructions to combat by eA^ery means in its power, including slander and insult, any GoAernment Avhich should try to restrain Gerniany&apos;s submarine action against Spain. This Germanised Press brought about the doAvnfall of Romanones by accusing him of favouring contraband and of being in the pay of the Allies, and scarcely stopped short of inciting attempts on his life.&quot; (4) The Democratic Element. As the Democratic parties formed the mainstay of the Allies in Spain, the Germans set about bribing individuals and journals in5257  4i) 0
MEXICO.Position of Carranza. The Foreign Office learns that the possibility of a successful revolution against Carranza (see Report No. 60) must still be kept in. view. The Government is without funds and unable to pay its troops, which are deserting in considerable numbers to Pelaez. General discontent with the present administration prevails throughout the Republic. In this connection the understanding of the Carranza Government with the Germans, and its ill-disposition towards the United States, are of interest. Forces of Pelaez have defeated Government troops at Pueblo Viejo, opposite J^amjhco. Revolutionaries have captured the capital of the State of Michoacan.(order to influence the working classes by the display of a feigned pacifism, and to deprive the Government of a strong Democratic backing should it seek a rupture with Germany. These four forces were used to avert a rupture with Germany. Next it was necessary to prevent exports to the Allies.&quot; (5) The Syndicalists. Tor this purpose recourse was had to the Anarchists and Syndicalists, who, hy their Press, meetings, and distribution of leaflets would propagate pacifism. To this force was also entrusted the organisation and execution of strike movements, having for chief object the dislocation of our industries with a view to preventing or hampering exports to Prance and England. It was hoped, that this action, together with the destruction, of ships bringing materials indispensable to national industry, would end. by creating universal disorder and making Spain a second edition of Russia. Nobody was ignorant of these manoeuvres, the Government least of all. Warnings and admonitions were so many voices in the wilderness. In vain, the Parliamentario published startling revelations of German espionage methods. The Government closed its eyes, stopped its ears, and would listen, to nothing, ddie revelations of the Sol came to illuminate the obscurity surrounding recent events, and to explain the premature strike of August. The Catalan Syndicalists were burning with impatience for a revolutionary movement, and treated as cowardice all counsels of prudence on the part of responsible organisations, so that, on one hand, ignorance of the extent to which these people were under foreign influence, and, on the other, the fear lest a prudent delay should alienate the working classes, and bring about a rupture between the General. Union of Workmen and the Confederation of Labour, induced them to precipitate events, with the result that die strike proved abortive. Neither of these organisations has ever had relations with the German or any other foreign Embassy, but it must be confessed that it was Germanised Spanish Syndicalism which in August forced on a movement, national in its origin, but which degenerated .through precipitancy into a manoeuvre favourable to a certain foreign Power which only sought the disorganisation, of our industry .... ddie fact is that within the Spanish State there is a powerful foreign. State whose action is unbounded. It will brush aside anyone who stands in its way : Romanones, if it fears a diplomatic rupture ; Garcia Prieto, if he decides to sign commercial conventions, and the most exalted heads if it is to its interest.   This force respects no man and no institution.   Itconstitutes a terrible danger for the country......It is still time to expel from ourterritory those who are dealing in. intrigues d la, Bernstorff and Luxburg. A. foreign nation, which conspires against Spaniards cannot have official representatives in Spain. Let us strike espionage in its nerve centre.&quot; (Daily Review, Neutral Press Supplement, March 22nd.)CHINA.Deportation of Enemy Aliens. Sir J. Jordan reports that he is now submitting to the Chinese Government the Allied assurance, in connection with the deportation of enemy aliens, that Chinese interests will be safeguarded at the Peace Conference. At the suggestion of the Japanese Government the assurance is made reciprocal as between China and the Allies (see Reports Nos. 57 and 58).Chinese Government: Military Policy. Sir J. Jordan reports that, by mandate issued on March 23rd, Tuan Chi Jui was reappointed Prime Minister. On March 11th the Chinese Government applied to the Allied Representatives for permission to draw upon the salt reserve of 10,000,000 dollars for the purpose of sending a force under Than Chi Jui to the Manchurian frontier.   The matter is under consideration.
Strike. Mr. Cummins learns that a general strike began on March 20th at the Mexican Eagle Main Depot and Refinery, the workmen demanding a 75 per cent, increase. Work has, however, already been partially resumed, and. the State authorities have the situation in hand.German Intrigue. The Foreign Office learns that German agents are endeavouring to secure in the Argentine a 250-horse-power motor for a wireless station in Mexico. (See Report No. 48.)SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. -According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period March 15th 21st inclusive was 103,90S tons gross, of which 72,770 were British, as compared with 67,133 tons gross, of which 34,491 were British, reported last week.Sinkings and Output. In the course of a statement made to the House of Commons on March 20th the First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that of 33,000,000 estimated world&apos;s ocean-going tonnage (exclusive of enemy-owned) existent at the beginning of the war, approximately 2,500,000 net (about 8 per cent.) had been lost from all causes up to December 31st, 19.1.7. Of this total amount 18,000,000 tons were British, of which 3,500,000 (about 20 per cent.) had been lost. With regard to output: in the fourth quarter of 1914 the merchant tonnage produced in the United Kingdom was 420,000 tons. This steadily fell, concurrently with the commencement of the great munition effort, until the fourth quarter of 1915, when it had fallen to 92,000 tons.   It then began to rise as follows : Quarterly, 19.16. Quarterly, 1917.1st quarter -         -     95,000 tons, i 1st quarter          -          - 216,000 tons.2nd quarter -            - 106,000   ,, : 2nd quarter -            - 249,000   ,,3rd quarter -         - .125,000   ,, ! 3rd quarter         -         - 248,0004th quarter -             - 213,000   ,, I 4th quarter -             - 420,000   ,,The output for the last quarter of 1917, added to the foreign output (512,000 tons) for the same period reached a figure (932,000 tons) which placed the Allies within 100,000 tons a month, on the average, of overtaking world&apos;s losses (1,200,000 tons) due to enemy action and submarine risk. Considering British, losses and output alone, the proportionate deficiency was somewhat higher ; the average British loss during the last quarter of 1917 was 261,000 tons per month, and the output 140,000 tons per month, a deficiency of 121,000 tons. With regard to repairs, a central organisation was created in the summer of 1.917 and the increase in the average weekly output of repaired merchant tonnage in February 1918 as compared with August .1.917 was SO per cent. an increased repair output of 69 merchant ships, representing 237,000 tons&apos; per week in the later month. In February 1918 repairs to merchant craft were completed at an average of 166 ships per week, representing more than 500,000 tons. The possibility of these repairs is largely due to the development of the convoy system which constantly enables damaged vessels to reach port ; a certain sacrifice of other shipbuilding has been made in order to build tugs to meet the demand for increased salvage ; in fact, the building of new merchant ships must always be considered in connection with the building of patrol and anti-submarine craft and the salvage and repair of damaged ships. The First Lord then reviewed the work of the Admiralty Controller and announced the appointment of Lord Pirrie as Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding.Danish-American Negotiations. With reference to the Danish contention that the British Government acknowledged the illegality of requisitioning by counting requisitioned vessels among those afterwards voluntarily ceded (see Report No. 60), the Foreign Office instructs Mr. Gurney to point out that such inclusion was an act of grace and did not in any way imply recognition of the Danish Governments contention.
Enemy Sailings. The Admiralty reports a marked increase during the week ending March 16th in the sailings of enemy merchant, ships between Germany and Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat, 12 having arrived at and 11 having left such ports.And see under &quot; Netherlands &quot; and &quot; Sweden.&quot;PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. Sir 11. Rumbold on March 11th reported that a private meeting was held in Geneva on February 25th by members of the Geneva section of the Inter-national Peace Bureau at Berne to discuss a proposed Beace Conference, to which delegates from the Entente Bovvers were to have been invited to meet delegates from the Central Powers and neutral countries. It transpired that the proposal to hold this Conference was initiated by a Dutchman at the request of German delegates. On March 16th Sir R. Rodd reported on good authority the wide dissemination of rumours about negotiations for peace, both, in Italy and in other countries of the Entente Alliance. These rumours were considered to be attributable to German inspiration, and their object was to undermine the spirit of the public in hostile countries, at the time when they were massing their forces on the Western front.German Wireless of March 23rd published an account of Vice-Chancellor von Payer&apos;s speech at the last reading of the German-Russian and German-Finnish Peace Treaties. In this speech, he endeavours to make out a case that the principle of self-determination is being applied in Poland, Lithuania and 0 our land.Russia. On March 20th Mr. Grove reported from Helsingfors an order received by the officer commanding the Russian ships to despatch his ,proposals for destroying the ships, and that instructions to a similar effect had been sent about the Russian Fleet in the Black Sea. [Press reports emanating from Moscow state that Russian naval forces have helped the Bolshevists to seize Odessa.]The Intelligence Bureau on Alarch 20th expressed the opinion that although peace has been formally ratified, it is almost inconceivable that it should, be kept for long, and the feeling against the Germans is likely to harden on closer acquaintance. Only the Bourgeoisie and theism a 11 shopkeeper class will be likely to welcome the Germans with relief.Mr. Lockhart, on Alarch 22nd, reported that Trotsky was enlisting help to re-organise the Army in Russia from the French Mission.On Alarch. 22nd, German AVireAss reported that M. Petrolf, as Chairman of the Committee for Foreign Affairs in the Soviet, had handed to the Alinister for Foreign Affairs an official notification, that tlie Peace Treaty of Brest, dated March 16th, had been ratified by the meeting of Deputies in Moscow.mr.

Trotsky, received with great applause, advocating the immediate formation of a &quot; trained and disciplined army to strike the enemies of liberty and revolution.&quot; lie explained, the military position, and added, &quot; We shall help Ukraine, which seems now stretching out a hand to us for help.&quot;On March 20th Mr. Lockhart reported that the United States Ambassador delivered a speech at Vologda On March .1.7th on the subject of the Beace Treaty with Germany. He expressed the readiness of America to offer assistance at once to those Russians who were really determined to resist on. an organised basis the invading armies of Germany. On March 24th German Wireless reported that the German Government had sent a message to the Russian Government in the following terms : -&quot; Confidently expect that the Russian Government will make such reply to this (the &quot; American) declaration as shall befit Beace Treaty concluded with the Central Bowers, &quot; the declaration in question being equivalent to a summons to Russia to resume the &quot; war against Germany.&quot; On March 26th Russian Wireless published a long reply signed by Chicherin which enumerates the facts of the case that the labouring and exploited masses of Russia have decided by themselves to conclude peace with Germany.   At the same time the attention of the German Government is drawn to1 Note. On March 26th, German Wireless sent a message from PetrofT to chicherin at Moscow :  &apos; I must stay in Berlin until Wednesday or Thursday, as the treaty ratified hy the Reichstag- has still to be signed.7&apos; On the same day, a report received through Mr. Woodbouse (Petrograd) indicates the possibility of a desire on behalf of the German Government to continue the war with Russia.
the fact that German troops continue to advance in the south of Russia, not only in the Ukraine, and that such action is not in. accordance with the Peace Treaty. The German Government is asked to state openly what frontiers it intends to give to the Ukrainian Republic.[German Wireless of March 25th published a notice to the Russian Government refusing to recognise the Russian protest against the German occupation of Odessa, -on the plea that the Ukrainian delegation at the peace negotiations at Brest had&apos; declared that &quot; the Government of Cherson, among others, belonged to Ukrainian &quot; territory. Odessa, therefore (sic) must also be considered to lie within Ukrainian. &apos;-&apos; territory.&quot; On March 27th, chicherin inquired in reply by Russian Wireless whether the declaration that Odessa belongs to the Ukraine &quot; is based upon verbal. &apos;&quot; declarations of Ukrainian delegates or upon some documents of an international &apos;&quot; character.&quot;]On March 26th Russian Wireless reported a message sent to the German Commander at Pskoff reporting that delegates had been sent there to discuss the demarkation line on the Lakes of Peipus and Pskoff, and asking that these delegates might be allowed to join the Demarkation Commission which left for Dvinsk on March 24t.li.[For Trans-Caucasia, sec. also under Turkey.]Finland. German Wireless of March 13th published an account from the Vossisclic Zeitung of the political programme of Finland in connection with the presence of the President of the Finnish Government in Berlin. The policy in the Aland Islands is said to be that wherever Finnish blood has been shed that shall become Finnish territory. A statement is made that East Karelia has appealed to the Finnish Republic to be taken into the young State. Finland days claim to Eastern Karelia and Kola as far as the exit to the sea, whereby an important stretch of the Murman railway line would come into Finnish hands. In order to justify this, the statement is made that if Finland does not grab this territory, the English would do so.Lithuania. German Wireless of March 13th reported the receipt by the Kaiser of :a telegram from Dorpat thanking the Kaiser for the salvation of Livonia &quot;in the name -of the Knighthood of Livonia.&quot; Similar thanks have been received from the German professors, lecturers and students of the old German High School at the same place. The Kaiser replied that he was gladdened by these messages, and expressed the hope that the period will result in the resurrection of Baltic-Germanic life to a free and. joyous development of its strength.On March 23rd Sir PL Rumbold reported on good authority a request made for a third time by the Council of State at Vilna for the German Government to recognise that Lithuania is completely independent. When the second request to this effect was made last January, the Germans claimed the control of the army, the telegraphs, railways and postal services ; also that Lithuania should enter into the Zollverein of Germany. The Germans were said to be putting severe pressure upon the Council of State.On March 24th German Wireless reported that Count Hertling had informed a delegation from the Lithuanian Landesrat, claiming to represent the Lithuanian people, that, in the name of the German Empire, Lithuania is recognised as a free and independent State, with certain conditions attached, notably that &quot; the convention to be established will take iuto account the interests of the German Empire as well as &quot; those of Lithuania, and also that Lithuania will participate in the war burdens -of &quot; Germany, &amp;c.&quot;Ukraine. German Wireless of March 13th, on the authority of the Kieff newspapers, stated that peace negotiations had commenced at Kieff between Russia and Ukraine.On March 21st German Wireless reported that the &quot; Small Rada &quot; in Kieff had. approved by a large majority the (7erman-Ukraine peace treaty.

Vice Chancellor von Payer met the most damning of the assertions, especially the one about the Crown Council held in Berlin on July 5th, 1914, with a flat denial, and stated &quot; all these statements are false as can be proved,&quot; but no such proofs were put forward.. On March 23rd German AVireless quotes an article from the Norddeutsche also denying the facts as reported &quot; in other quarters.&quot; On March 25th German AVireless publishes a statement by von Jagovv, who was Foreign Secretary at the time referred to in Prince Lichno\vsky&apos;s. disclosures, in which an attempt is made to explain away the truths they contain.Turkey.
