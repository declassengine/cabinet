SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHE IJ  WESTERN  AN!) GENERALREPORT No.  58.PAET II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Peace Discussions.Eastern Front. The negotiations between the Central Powers and the Bolshevists at Brest have passed out of the stage of discussions, and a Peace Treaty, amounting to a humble surrender by Russia, was signed, on March 3rd. The terms of the Treaty were published in full in the Times of Match 6th. The terms agreed to by the Bolshevists give to Germany a large measure of the &quot; economic development in every direction &quot; which Count Hertling has now told us was the German war aim &quot; from the beginning.&quot; In addition to the points referred to in last week&apos;s Western Report, special attention is invited to concessions to German influence on the Eastern Black Sea littoral. This should be read in conjunction with Sir W. TownJey&apos;s report on a route to the Middle East considered superior to the Baghdad route. The German design for establishing a line of shipping in the Black Sea under German control, (see last Appreciation) fits in with this plan. From reports coming in from Russia, it seems possible that the Germans in their peace terms have overdone their bullying of a beaten enemy, and that there may be a reaction.Attention is drawn to Baron von deni Bussche&apos;s announcement about a forthcoming &quot; peace treaty &quot; with Finland, and about Rurnania&apos;s readiness to discuss a separate peace. A &quot;preliminary&quot; treaty is now reported to have been signed. There is a rumour of tentative approaches by Serbia to Austria-Hungary with a view to peace.Western Front. Confirmation has been received of the report received from Sir E. Howard (see last Appreciation) about the object Count Hertling had in view in making his last speech. A short review of that speech is given in an Appendix to this week&apos;s Report. Mr. Balfour dealt with the speech on February 27th, and the German Press and Wireless can find no adequate reply, based on facts, especially with regard to Belgium. The old myth about a Convention Anglo-Beige is being revived. It may be considered desirable to refute this German move again by means of suitable propa-gancla in enemy and neutral countries ; it seems too transparent a falsehood to obtain credence elsewhere. .Allied Aefaiks.Reports on negotiations about the policy of the Allies in Siberia are deferred until next week.

PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Far East. An announcement of the policy to be followed by the Allies in regard to action in Siberia is deferred until next weelPs Report.Allied Coal Distribution. The question of supply of coal by Great Britain and France to Italy continues to receive attention, and will shortly come before the Inter-allied Maritime Transport Council for decision.Allied. Purchases in United, Slates. Lord Reading reports that the United States authorities have consented to the provisional adoption of the procedure suggested by him (see Report No. 57) in respect of British purchases. At a meeting of the Inter-allied Council on War Purchases and Finance held on February 9th, the President, Mr. Crosby, emphasised, the importance of ascertaining wdiat stocks of munitions were available in France, Great Britain, the United. States.and elsewhere. He also reported that he had ashed the financial authorities of the European Allies for full information in regard to loans raised, or to he raised, by them in neutral countries. It was resolved that the Supreme War Council should be invited to examine and report upon the comparative urgency of the Allied requirements.Bolshevist Emissaries. The Foreign Office informs His Majesty&apos;s Ministers at Christiania and Stockholm that the Bolshevist emissaries, Kameneff, Saalkincl and Savitzky (mentioned in Report No. 51; are returning from England to Russia, having been refused admission into France.FRANCE.French Socialists and the Allied Labour Conference. -Tie Intelligence Bureau notices the reversal by the Socialist National Council of the recent decisions of the Seine Confederation ; first, by giving a general adhesion to -the British Labour Memorandum ; secondly, in supporting (by a very narrow majority), the war credits as a &quot; symbol of national, defence ; &quot; and thirdly, in refusing to demand the resignation of the Socialist Cpmipissair.es. It is observed, however, that in. order to obtain support for the credits, the Majority felt it necessary to conciliate the Minority by threatening that such Socialist support might be revoked if the Government placed obstacles in the way of an International Conference. Further, the agreement upon war aims was largely a matter of expediency, aimed at securing a programme, justifying an International Conference, and obtaining certain concessions from the English. There is thus a clanger that Germany may endeavour to barter Alsace-Lorraine for its captured colonies; Britishers and Frenchmen should understand that this is a question which concerns the Dominions, neglect of whose views might jeopardise not only the British Empire, but also the democratic principles for which France and Great Britain stand, ddie views of the French Majority Socialists are still strong and definite, and were more or less voiced by the Belgian, M. Yandervelde, when, he remarked, that the only thing which, prevented the resolutions from being mere scraps of paper was the Allied Army stretched out from Nieuport to Venice. The party has even insisted on the German Socialists taking some real action as a preliminary to the convening of an International Conference. It is to be noted that a new Socialist body calling itself a Committee for a &quot; paix du droit &quot; has been formed, which stands at the extreme right and vigorously attacks the official leaders for willingness to meet the enemy, for pacifism and even Bolshevism.
Alsiice-Lprraine. Lord Bertie reports that oii March 1st a great meeting was held :at the So.rboi.iae in commemoration of. the protest in 1871 agaitist the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. M. Pichon presided, and the meeting was attended by the President, the members of Government and the Archbishop of Paris. M. Pichon, in the course of his speech, read a letter dated October 1870 from the German. Emperor to the Empress Eugenie, stating that the provinces were annexed for strategic reasons and not on grounds of nationality. ,Labour. -Lord Bertie reports a serious strike at a citrogen factory near Paris.italy.Socialist Officials Sentenced.-According to a Press report, Lazzari, General -/Secretary of the Socialist ,.Party, and Bombacci, . the Vice-Secretary, charged with disseminating propaganda calculated to weaken the country&apos;s power of resistance,-have been sentenced, the former to two years and eleven months imprisonment and a fine of 3,900 lire, and the latter to two years and four months imprisonment and a fine of 2,100 lire, in addition to payment of costs.British Commercial Interests.- In a despatch dated February. jfSfch Sir R. Rodd draws attention to the great interest taken by Signor Nitti, Minister of the Treasury, in the Italian industrial banks. Sir R. Rodd observes that considerable commercial and economic progress is being made in Italy by the French and. Americans,&quot; and. urges the importance of organising British interests in that country.PORTUGAL.Position of Government. Sir L. Carnegie reports the probability of an early election in Portugal, the probable result of which cannot be estimated. Another revolution is regarded as not unlikely.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Feeling towards War. In a despatch dated. February loth, Sir II. Rumbold reports a statement (made prior to the Ukraine peace) on conditions in Austria by an informant from Vienna. The Austria as are represented as being quite exhausted in -every sense. The demeanour -^of the people has changed considerably since the strikes, a repetition of which rs very probable. German officers are so unpopular that there have been cases in which they have gone about Vienna in plain clothes so as to avoid attracting attention. The only factor which keeps the military spirit alive is hatred, of the Italians, which is exploited co the utmost by the Government.Austria, Germany and Ukralnla. The Intelligence Bureau points out that the basis of agreement between Vienna and Kiev is threefold (a) a combination against Bolshevism ; (&amp;) the desire of Kiev to find customers and an economic basis for the existence of the new State ; and (c) the desire of Vienna to conciliate one of ;.its own three hostile Slav groups, the Ukrainians, and to exploit their dominant influence with their kinsmen in the new Republic. In this connection the dependance of the Ukraine upon Galicia for its intelligentsia is noticeable. The President of the Rada, Hrusevsky, has for years been Professor of History at Lemberg University, and several other leaders of the new Republic hail from Galicia. From statements in the Lokalanzeiger of Alarch 1st it appears that Austrian opposition to the German advance into Ukrainian territory has developed (owing to want of grain) into jealousy, and from jealously into emulation. The paper blames the Austrian Government for causing &quot; such regrettable sallies of temper as Austria has lateljAndulged in against her German Allies,&quot; by delaying the Austrian advance. The Intelligence Bureau observes that Germany-s economic offensive against Russia is palliated by the official Austrian explanation that it is essential to regulate the chaotic condition of commercial relations resulting from - TrptskPs regime.   With regard to Austrian hopes of supply,
the- Neue Freie Presse calculates that the grain obtainable from Ukraine, after-allowance for the shares of Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria, would leave for Austria only a little more than half her deficit, and that this amount would be subject to-increasingly serious problems of distribution.The Cholm Question. The Intelligence Bureau reports that the assignment to the Ukraine of the whole Government of Cholm (the western portion of which, has a purely Polish population) has aroused intense indignation, not merely among the Poles of Warsaw, where the Kucharzewski Cabinet has resigned as a protest, but equally among the Poles of America. The new frontier is impossible from a strategic point of view, and everything suggests that the arrangement is not intended to be permanent, but is a &quot; deal &quot; by which the Poles are to be allowed to spend their rage on the loss of Cholm, so that, when it is restored to them later, they may be more ready to accept the eventual loss of Eastern Galicia to the Ukraine. The announce-ment of the treaty has driven the Poles into flat opposition of the Government, with the result that the.Austrian Parliament now finds itself challenged by the Poles as &quot;well as (on other grounds) by the Czechs. Neither internal nor external opinion will allow of a Government in Austria independent of Parliament, and-an.impasse has thus been reached, which is recognised as no longer one of the countless governmental or parliamentary crises of the past, but as a &quot; State crisis.&quot;Lord Bertie learns that an entire Polish Brigade has recently deserted from the Austrian forces and is now in Bessarabia. He also points out that soldiers of Polish nationality form a large part of the Austrian Army on the Italian front.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Annexation and Economics. Mr. Lindley reports that whether the Bolshevist regime survives or gives place to anarchy, Germany will probably find a reason to intervene in order to establish an administration more favourable to herself. The-Intelligence Bureau, sums up the territorial effects of the German-Bolshevist terms as cutting off Courland, Lithuania, Congress Poland, and the Ukraine from all connection with the Russian State. Livonia and Esthonia will be &quot; policed. &quot; by German military forces until their constitution can provide them with social security and political order. In pursuance of her economic schemes as against the Allies, Germany will continue the blockade of the Arctic Ocean till the conclusion of a general peace. She further proposes to resume commercial relations with Russia on the basis of the-Treaty of 1904, with a guarantee for the free, uxitariffed export of ore, and to enter into an agreement on most-favoured-nation terms (to last at least till 1925), similar to that which, she covenanted to give to the Ukraine. Under these and (it is understood) future treaties, the commercial solidarity of Mittei Europa will have to be recognised so that apparently the special Customs conventions between Germany and her Allies will be excepted from, the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause. The other contracting party may make the same reservation ; and under this arrangement a British Empire or Interallied Customs Union would seem to offer possibilities of retaliation to the disadvantage of Germany. In the case of Germany ;s Allies such an economic union would, in effect, deprive them of their sovereignty and centralise them under Germany. The severance of the Cholm country (see under &quot; Enemy Allied Affairs &quot;) will draw together the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian Poles, and make the suppression of Polish aspirations a permanent problem for Germany.Democratic ()pinion.-&apos;liha Intelligence Bureau observes that the bitterness caused by the politically ineffective strike still remains. The militarist treatment of (he-strikers and of the Press which tried to interpret their views still rankles in the mind of the masses. There are signs that democratic opinion is able to assert itself ; at a recent by-election on the Rhine, an unofficial non-annexationist Centre candidate defeated an opponent who was backed by the Catholic annexationist Press; the new &quot; League for Freedom and Fatherland,&quot; started in opposition to the Fatherland Party,., has already recruited 4,000,000 members of all political colours, including National Liberals. But, as the Frankfurter- Zeitung insists, the democratic elements in Germany will have to wake up and wage a far more vigorous campaign than they have hitherto contemplated if militarism . and economic and political reaction are not to hold the field after the conclusion of peace. Sir W. Townley reports the dismissal of the-Liberal anti-annexationist editor-in-chief  of the Miinchener Neuesle  Naclirichien
owing tp intrigues of the Fatherland Party; Sir W. Townley reports an interesting speech made by Scheidemann on February 26th.: lie declared that the Germans were fighting against the Imperialism of the Entente; but not for the break up of Russia, the suppression of Belgium, or the acquisition of Longvvy and Briey. The Russian settlement was only advantageous as a step towards general peace. ;German aggression towards Russia had alienated the majority of the population of Austria-Hungary. Social Democracy repudiated a recent speech (by the Kaiser)&apos; which claimed that the world must be brought to acknowledge a German victory : it desired no peace reposing upon force. It was regrettable that force, instead of sympathy, had been employed in the suppression of the recent strikes ; in this respect, the methods of England and Bavaria were a lesson to Prussia. The attitude of the Junkers towards the workers was intolerable, and the people would answer at the next elections. The German people would, emerge wiser and freer from the terrible ordeal through which it was passing.Suffrage. The German Press reports the speech (on February 25th) of von Payer, acting for the first time in his new capacity of Vice-Ohancellor. He emphasised that the Imperial Government stood behind the Prussian Government on the question of Suffrage Reform. His observations were received with, much hostility by the -Junkers.Jews.---Germania of February 2-5th, in a leading article, draws attention, to the prominence of Jews in the public-life of Greater Russia and Ukrainia. It notices particularly the appointment of a Jew named Dimendstein to look after Jewish interests, and observes that his organisation is to be. a ill bated with other foreign Jewish. Socialistic organisations with the object of forwarding Socialistic revolution among the working classes. One Silberfarb has been, mentioned as carrying on similar work in Ukrainia. Sir E. Howard reports that proclamations written in Polish,&quot;but printed in Berlin, have been discovered at Cracow and Lemberg, inciting the people to massacre the Jews. :Western Offensive. Sir If. Rum bold reports a statement that during the first half of March the Germans will, attack both. Calais and Milan. They are propagating the view in. Switzerland, that Germany would be glad to make easy terras with France and Italy, but must reserve her&apos;strength for vanquishing England. It would seem, that the German Government is doubtful, as to the probable success of German offensive in the West.Air Raids. The Kolnisehe Zeitung of March 2nd reports an interpellation, in the Bavarian. House of Representatives, regarding Government indemnification for the ever-increasing loss from air raids suffered by the people of Bavaria, and more especially the Pfalz district.NETHERLANDS.Coal. The Nieuwe 0 our ant reports the establishment by the Dutch Foreign Office of a Commission for investigating the basis upon which economic relations with the Central Powers are to be maintained upon, the termination on March.31st of the existing Coal Agreement with Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government has decided not to supply further British coal to Holland until there appears to be some prospect of an early conclusion of a general agreement with the Dutch (see Report No. 57).German Operations in Dutch -Territorial Waters. Sir W. Townley has called, the attention of the Netherlands Government to an attack made on February 27th by two German hydroplanes on a British convoy inside Dutch territorial waters.Sand and Gravel. With regard to the settlement of the sand and gravel, question, hopes of which were indicated, in Report No. 55, Sir W. Townley now reports that the Netherlands Foreign Office would not assent to the appointment of a single referee with full powers to decide on the objects for which sand and gravel are to be utilised ; it would only agree, to the appointment of an arbitrator, to act by consent of the Dutch, British, and German Governments. The German Government has informed the Netherlands Government that provisionally this traffic will not be resumed after March 15th. If the Germans subsequently wish, to resume &apos; it, the Netherlands Government propose to insist on local investigation in Belgium by
a Dutch Commission, which will inform the British and German Governments of its conclusions; these, if challenged, would be further submitted to a neutral arbitrator, who should give a general ruling in the matter. Meanwhile, a system of internal control is being established, and licences will not be granted for export -to Belgium of Dutch sand and gravel beyond the normal pre-war rate of about 360,000 tons per annum. According to the Netherlands Foreign Office, Dutch demands are at present so considerable as to preclude the likelihood of any considerable exportation. (And see under &quot; Shipping Situation &quot; and &quot; General.&quot;)SWITZERLAND.Wheat Supply. In connection with recent articles in the Swiss Press criticising the ineffectiveness of the Allied, supply of wheat to Switzerland, Sir II. Rumbold has pointed out to the President that the economic difficulties of Switzerland are to be ascribed to the German submarine campaign. This explanation has since been emphasised by the torpedoing of a Spanish ship carrying 3,000 tons of corn to Switzerland. The Foreign Office has instructed. Lord. Reading to enquire whether the United States would be prepared to guarantee the necessary tonnage. Such an undertaking would materially assist the British loan negotiations. Lord Reading reports that the United States Government will endeavour to provide half the tonnage immediately necessary. Meanwhile there is a probability that the Germans will make an offer of wheat to Switzerland, which her necessity may drive her to accept.SWEDEN.-Aland Islands and Germany. SirE. Howard reports that as the result of an appeal by the Finnish Government to Germany for assistance against the Red Forces, the Germans declared their intention, of landing a force in the Aland Islands, informing the Swedish Government that the islands were required as a &quot; station d&apos;etape &quot; for operations in Finland. It further appears that the German Emperor sent a telegram to the King of Sweden expressing surprise at the Swedish expedition to Aland, and that General Mannerheim is court-martialling the officer of the White Guard who agreed with the Swedes to evacuate the islands. The Swedish Government protested, against any use being made of the islands which might involve the Archipelago in military operations. According to a German Wireless report, the landing has now been effected. It seems clear that Germany is taking advantage of the situation to discredit the Swedish Government, and to get it replaced by a pro-German administration. It is also possible that she will later on claim the islands as compensation for &quot;the assistance given to the Finnish Government, though the German Minister has assured the Swedish Foreign Office that she has no territorial ambitions in regard to the Archipelago, and that she recognises the vital interests of Sweden therein. The Swedish Government has intimated its intention of withdrawing its force from the islands as soon as its humanitarian aims (see Report No. 57) have been, attained. Such a policy will tend to throw the odium of the retirement upon Germany.Arms Regulation. Sir E. Howard reports the promulgation on March 5th of a Royal Decree prohibiting the sale or import of arms and ammunition without special licence.Negotiations with Allies. Sir E. Howard reports a semi-official communique, dated March 2nd, announcing the conclusion of the modus vivendi. (See Reports Nos. 54 and. 56, under &quot; Shipping Situation.&quot;) The news Jias been received with somewhat subdued satisfaction by the Liberal Press, and is strongly attacked by the Conservative papers. The effect on Germany in present circumstances is anticipated with alarm, and fears are expressed that the loss of ships will make Sweden dependent on Germany for imports after the war. An Interallied Trade Commission is being set up in Stockholm to superintend the carrying out of the agreement. The Commission will also superintend the disposal of goods still in Sweden under the Transito Scheme. LWbb      .&quot;-&apos;L &quot;DENMARK.Danish-American Negotiations. With regard to the Danish reply (see Report No. 57) to the proposals of the United States  War  Trade Board, His Majesty&apos;s
Government lias suggested to the War Trade Board that the proposed Danish exports to the enemy of bacon, butter, eggs, milk, and fats should be limited.to 500 tons per week, and that no cheese or casein should be exported ; it is further suggested that Great Britain should have the option to purchase amounts ecpial to those exported to the enemy. It is also pointed out that the German-Danish Agreement of November 1917 terminates at the end of March, and that it is desirable that the United States Government should reach a settlement before the Danes begin negotiating with Germany for its renewal. Lord Heading reports that the War Trade Board is insisting that charters of Danish vessels under the agreement must be for the duration of the war, and that one-third of the vessels handed over to the United States must be employed in the -war zone ; it doubts whether the negotiations as a whole are likely to terminate in any useful result. Sir B. Paget reports that the Danish Foreign Office, possibly with a view to strengthening its attitude, is expressing apprehension of German pressure.Danish Butter and British Coal. Sir R. Paget reports that he has been unable to persuade the Danish Government to lower the price of butter, or liberate an increased amount for exportation to Great Britain. In the circumstances he suggests that a set-off might be effected by a temporary increase in the price of British coal exported to Denmark. NStranded German Prize. Sir It. Baget reports that the S.S. Igolz Mendi (see Report No. 57) is now under tlie Spanish flag and that attempts are being made to salve her. The Foreign Office instructs him. to insist that the cargo must be considered as imported into Denmark, and therefore subject to export restrictions. The German Press is very indignant at the attitude adopted by the Danish Government.Iceland. With reference to the apprehension felt by the Danish. Government in regard to negotiations by Iceland direct with the Allies (see Reports Nos. 5-1 and 57), the Foreign Office has authorised Sir R. Paget. to give an assurance that His majesty&apos;s Government is anxious to co-operate with the Danish Government in obviating any political difficulties (whether external or internal) in the conclusion and execution of the revised agreement.FINLAND.Finland, Sweden and Germany. The Foreign Office learns that there appears to be a difference of opinion between the Finnish and Swedish Governments as to how far the assent of the former was obtained to the occupation of the Aland Islands (see under &quot; Sweden &quot;). The Finns accuse the Swedes of refusing them assistance while profiting by the occasion to forward Swedish interests. The Finnish Govern-ment has expressed to the Kaiser its admiration for &quot; the glorious exploits of the German people and commanding officers,&quot; and its thanks for what Germany has done for &quot; Finland; and has expressed the hope that &quot;in the impending final peace &quot; conference the Emperor, as the most powerful protector of Germanic culture and &quot; evangelical faith, will safeguard the striving of the Finnish people towards liberty &quot; and peaceful development&quot; by insisting on evacuation by the Russians and the surrender of arms by the revolutionaries. Politiken, on March 2nd, published a document indicating that, shortly after FinlancPs declaration of independence, certain Finnish Delegates left for Berlin to invite Germany to occupy the Aland Islands. The Germans have now clone so and propose to use the islands as a base for operations in Finland. According to the Aftoniidning of March 3rd, General Mannerheim only desired arms and ammunition from Germany, and has expressed dissatisfaction at the despatch of German forces in a manner which has caused much annoyance in Germany. Interpellations in the Riksdag show a strong feeling that SwedeAs hegemony of the Baltic States is threatened. The Norwegian newspapers express anxiety at the possible results of German intervention on. the future of Scandinavia.Finland and Great Britain. The White Guards have occupied Silastupa and interfered with British traffic on the Skibotn route ; the incident is receiving the attention of the British and Norwegian Governments. Reports tend to show that the White Forces, in the probable event of success, will be not only pro-German but also anti-British.
british Subjects. Steps are being taken by the British and Swedish Governments to evacuate British subjects from Finland. General Mannerheim has promised to give all possible assistance to the Allied Diplomatists, and the Swedish Government has offered facilities at H a para n da. ^ .Food Supply. In view of the action of the Finnish Government in soliciting German intervention, it is doubtful whether the British and United States Govern-ments will any longer feel called upon to supply foodstuffs to Finland. It is stated that the White Forces are adequately provisioned.SPAIN.Spanish. Government. Sir A. Hardinge  reports  that the King of Spain has requested Senor Garcia Prieto to retain the Premiership and to reconstitute his Ministry.   There will probably be a coalition between, the Conservatives and Demo-cratic liberals, in which representatives of the Albist and. Romanonist parties may&apos; possibly be included.Spanish-American Negotiations. The Foreign Office learns that the negotiations1 for an economic agreement between the United States and. Spanish Governments are now concluded and that the agreement will be signed immediately upon the signature: of the collateral Franco-Spanish Agreement. It appears that the French Government, in its anxiety to secure immediate Spanish credits for Allied purchases in Spain,&apos; requested the United States, Government not to press for concessions in regard to Spanish tonnage. In view, however, of the importance of such tonnage for Allied services, especially in connection with the iron, ore trade, Lord Reading has been instructed to urge the United States Government to work for a satisfactory shipping arrangement with the Spanish Government.THE VATICAN.Article 15 of the Italian Treaty. The Foreign Office has instructed His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at the Vatican to explain to the Holy See the true construction of Article 15 of the Italian Treaty as intended and understood by His Majesty&apos;s Government, such construction being entirely at variance with the mis-leading interpretation given by the Bolshevists.JAPAN.Exports to Russia. The Foreign Office instructs Sir 0. Greene that, having regard to the relaxation of the Chinese embargo and the continuance of exports from die United States to Russia (see Report No. 56), he should not press for prohibition of Japanese exports to Russia, but should urge the Japanese Government to forbid, re-exportation of British goods or their products to Russia.CHINA.Enemy Subjects. With regard to the proposed assurance to be given to the Chinese Government in connection with the deportation of enemy aliens (see Report No. 57), the Foreign Office informs Sir J. Jordan that in view of the special circumstances of Belgium, the Belgian Government would prefer not to participate in. such assurance. Sir ,1. Jordan reports that the Japanese Government also appears-unwilling to join in the general assurance, and points out that the whole question of deportation is now dependent on Japanese acquiescence.ARGENTINE.* Suggested further Arrangements with Allies.- Sir R. Tower reports a suggestion by the Argentine Foreign Office to arrange the supply of meat to the British Government
on terms analogous to those of the Wheat Convention. The Argentine Government further appears to be desirous of negotiating for preferential supply of&apos; all Argentine produce to the Allies.Argentina Navy. Sir R. Tower learns that the Argentine Government is desirous of accpiiring &quot;cruisers and submarines as soon as the war is over.Freezing Establishments. Sir R. Tower reports a serious strike by the Seamen&apos;s Labour Union in the freezing establishments at Buenos Aires. On the intervention of the Argentine Government the trouble has been suppressed.BOLIVIA.Enemy Tin Mines. -Idle Foreign Office informs Mr. Haggard that careful con-side ration is being given to the cpiestion of the acquisition of enemy mines in Bolivia by British-American interests (see Report No. 55).MEXICO.Carranza and the United States Commercial Proposals. Mr. Cummins reports that the commercial arrangement proposed by the United States Government (see Report No. 56) has been rejected by Carranza.The Oilfields. The Foreign Office learns that the situation in the&apos;oilfields is quiet. Pelaez has issued strict orders to his troops that no damage is to be done. The Mexican Government has expressed its intention to impose fresh taxation on the exportation of Mexican oil. The British and United States Governments are protesting again stthis proposal, which appears to be illegal and oppressive.German Propaganda. Mr. Cummins points out that German propaganda in Mexico is deriving considerable benefit from various speeches, articles, and interviews published in the London Press, tending to disparage British aims and- efforts or to magnify the achievements and prospects of Germany. Such matter is rapidly transmitted through Spanish and other channels, and has a most mischievous effect.UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Mr. Baiter. The Foreign Office learns that Mr. Baker, United States Secretary for War, will shortly arrive in Europe to study the situation at first hand.Wool Purchases. Lord Reading reports that in order to check speculation, the United States Government intends to exercise its option (see Report No. 48) to purchase certain qualities of imported wool, including South American, and, if necessary, to purchase and import South American wools on its own account.Liberty Loan. Lord Reading reports that the United States Government desires to invite a certain number of British Officers, with experience of the front, to participate in the publicity campaign for the next Liberty Loan.(And sec. under &quot; Shipping Situation.&quot;)SHIPPING SITUATION.Shillings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the.malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period February&apos;-22nd 28th inclusive, was 90,913 tons gross, of which 59,748 were British, as compared with 75,070 tons gross, of which 66,103 were British, reported last week.Insurance Fates. Sir M. Findlay reports that owing to the diminution of losses during the last six months, the premiums charged in the re-insured trade have recently been considerably in excess of risks. Consequently, British and Allied charterers are anxious to take advantage of cheaper rates offered outside Norwegian War Insurance, which therefore suggests that circumstances now allow of a reduction in all insurance rates in the re-insured trade.5257-160
Insurance Documents. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Heading to request the United States Government to adopt measures for preventing the despatch from the United States of insurance documents referring to ships&apos; voyages until such vessels shall have reached their final destination.United States and Goal. The Ministry of Shipping reports that the coal position, in United States ports has somewhat improved, and arrangements are in hand to co-ordinate with America the shipment of coal to all destinations ; this applies specially to shipments to South America.Enemy Ships in Spain. The Foreign Office learns that the United States Govern-menr has abandoned, its negotiations lor the purchase of enemy ships in Spain, and that the Italian Government is now taking up the matter. /Dutch-American Negotiations.;, Lord Reading reports that, owing to German pressure and the unwillingness of Dutch owners, the modus vivendi is not being fully-carried out, and it seems doubtful whether the agreement can become effective. In the circmnstances it may be found necessary to requisition the Dutch vessels now in American ports. Sir W. Townley and the United States Minister at The Hague strongly deprecate such requisitioning in present circumstances. They submit that the dependence of Holland on the Allies for rations and coal will constrain the Govern-ment to conclude an agreement with them, and that any blame for delay in so doing-will fall upon Germany. Meanwhile it is suggested that, in consideration for the immediate use of the ships, the Allies should undertake to place a quantity of cereals at the disposal of the Netherlands in a United States port by a given date.(And see under &quot; Allied Affairs,&quot; &quot; Switzerland,&quot; &quot; Sweden,&quot; &quot;Denmark,&quot;\ and &quot;Spain.&quot;)PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. Mr. Lindley on February 25th reported on good authority M. Trotsky&apos;s opinion that peace between Germany and Russia could only be temporary. On. March 2nd Mr. Lockhart was hopeful about the organisation of resistance in Russia and thought that the Bolshevists did not intend to keep the peace they were signing. He repeated, this opinion on March 3rd, adding that a Congress to be held in Moscow is likely to determine for a Holy War.Mr. Lockhart (Petrograd) on March -1th reported on M. Trotsky&apos;s authority the official signature of peace at Brest, and an announcement by the Germans that their offensive had been stopped from. March 3rd at 1 p.m. In Mr. Lockhart&apos;s opinion the situation so created will not last for long.A report from Mr. Wardrop (Moscow) dated March 2nd also conveys the impression that the Bolshevists, especially those of Moscow, are ready to continue the war on Germany.Krylenko, as &quot; Highest Commander-in-Chief,&quot; issued an order by wireless to all fronts on the morning of March 4th for the cessation of all hostilities against the Quadruple Alliance, and on March 5th he protested by wireless to German and Austro-Hungarian military authorities against the continuance of fighting by the troops&apos; of those Powers on the &quot; Jamburg-Orska and Homel-Briansk line &quot; and. &quot; other places.&quot;Lenin and Trotsky announced by wireless on March -1th that March 7th had been fixed for ratification of (he peace treaty. It has been suggested, in. the Press that there must be some misunderstanding whether this means according to old or new calendar, as the Bolshevists are credited with an announcement to the effect that they had a fortnight available to consult the people&apos;s representatives at a Conference at Moscow.The actual terms of the peace treaty were published by German Wireless on March 5th, and are given in full in the Times of March 6th. The conditions are still harder than those in the original, ultimatum accepted by the Bolshevists by Wireless (see former Western Reports) and subsequently in writing. The treaty is between Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey on. the one side and &quot;Russia&quot; on the other. In addition to the points to which attention was called in Western Report No. 57, Article 5 contains the words &quot;Russia will bring her warships either into &quot;Russian ports, and leave them there until a conclusion of a general peace, or &quot;disarm them, at once.&quot;    The warships of States remaining at war with  the
&quot;Quadruple Alliance are to be treated as Russian sbips. Article 4 provides for tbe -evacuation by Russia of the East Anatolian provinces, and of the Ardahan. Ears and Batonni districts, where Russia must &quot;leave it to the populations to carry out the new arrangements, in agreement with their neighbouring States, especially Turhey&quot;Sir W. Townley on March 4th calls attention to theGerman demands for surrender by Russia of Kurdsakhan, Ears and Batoum, which he connects with a former impression derived by him in Rumania (in 1912) that the Oonstanza-Black Sea-Batoum or ITebizoud route was considered a more direct,route to the Middle East than the one via Baghdad.On March 5th he gave the text of a protest issued to the Press by the Russian Legation against the &quot;separate peace treaty concluded with the Maximalists with Germany and her allies.&quot;In addition to this treat)7 with &quot; Russia &quot; the Germans have exploited the military situation in the East, and the naval situation in the Baltic, to make similar &quot; treaties &quot; tending to their own advantage. German Wireless on March 5th reported that on the pFevious day Baron von dein Bussche announced that a peace treaty Avitb Finland would arrive in Berlin for signature in the course of a few days.In connection with the Ukraine peace it is interesting to note from Russian Wireless announcements of March 2nd and 3rd that the BolsheAusts tried to send a &quot;Delegation of the Beople&apos;s Secretariat of the Ukraine Republic &quot; from Kharkoff to the Brest Conference for signature of the peace with &quot; Russia,&quot; and that the delegation, headed by Zatonsky, was held up by the Germans at Pskolf. [Russian Wireless of feburary 27th had announced the Avillingness of the Zatonsky delegation to sign the peace treaty concluded with the Kieff Rada.]Idle latest report on the prospects of Ramania&apos;s making a separate peace is contained in Baron a^oii dem BusschAs announcement in the Reichstag, reported in German Wireless of March 5th : &quot; It is known that Rumania has declared that she is ready to enter into peace negotiations on the basis of our proposals.&quot; This is confirmed by a reliable report from Jassy forwarded by Lord Bertie on Alarch 5th. It is gathered by reports from. Lord Bertie (February 27th to March 2nd) that these proposals are of an aggressive nature. The actual terms have not been, published.1 The violence of Count OzerniAs language during his brief visit to Bucharest, on his AA^ay to Brest, astonished the Rumanian delegates. Ministers at Jassy -attach importance to publishing as widely as possible the threat of dividing up Rumania betAveen Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary, and of the monstrous nature of this threat. On March 1st Sir G. Barclay was informed of our confidence that the alleged German claim for a long lease of all oilfields in. Rumania would not be entertained by the Rumanian Government as a peace condition.Germany. German Wireless of feburary 27th publishes rather florid propaganda on the German peace with the Ukraine, of which the following is a typical extract: -&quot;Now the Germans are there, God be thanked. One breathes again, the Germans ! That is to say, the return of discipline and order.&quot; Also similar propaganda about the adA-auce in Esthonia and LiA-onia, said to be &quot; against the robber bands of the Red Guards.&quot;Sir 1.1. Rumbold on March 1st confirmed on reliable authority the impression already communicated by Sir E. Howard (see last week&apos;s Report) that Count Hertling&apos;s speech Avas delivered as a feeler, to find out whether there was any prospect of a peaceful settlement as an alternative to a great German offensive in the West, of which the outcome Avas doubtful in the opinion of the German Government. On March 4th he forwarded extracts from the German Press on Mr. BalfouFs reply, which seems to haAre caused some indignation, but no valid refutation is forthcoming of any of the points made. Regret is expressed for the confession by Bethmanu-Holiweg of the German crime in Belgium, but none for the commission of the crime.The Norddeibtsche Allgemeine Zeitung, according to German Wireless of Alarch 2nd, tries to revive the old accusation against England of tampering with Belgian neutrality before the Avar. [The &quot; Convention Anglo-Beige &quot; myth, and the German forgeries connected with it, were exposed by Sir Theodore Cook in his book &quot; The Alark of the Beast.&quot;]1 On the authority of a Bucharest telegram, of March 5th, the Times of March. 7th reports the signature of a &quot;preliminary &quot; toeaty between the Quadruple Alliance and Rumania.   The terms are given in frill.. &apos; They illustrate again the avowed German policy of economic expansion&apos;in every direction hy the use of force.   Sir W. Townley gathers (March 6th) that separate treaties with individual countries of the Alliance are to he signed later.
Sir W. Townley, on March 4th, called attention to the admission by the Berliner Tageblqtl of the German demands, just before the Avar, for the cession of To ml and Verdun, as announced by M. Pichon.Sir W. Townley, on March 1st, gave the srdztstance of a leading article in the Vorwarbs of February 28th, which contains the reply of the-German Majority Socialists to the Programme of the London Congress. This was-dealt with by the Times in a leading article on March 6th.Austria-Hungary. The Intelligence Bureau on March 2nd reported that the-economic sections of the Austrian Peace Treaty with the Ukraine Rada are based upon the Commercial Treaty of 1906 between Austria-Hungary and Russia, It is assumed that there will be three economic stages : (1) Up to August 1st next for the exchange of surplus products ; (2) a- provisional period up to June 30th 1919, renewable for six months at a time, during which the new Commercial Treaty is to be arranged, and (3) the permanent settlement under that Treaty. In this connection, great attention is being devoted in the Press to economic-conditions in the Ukraine.Sir W. Townley, on March 5th, forwarded evidence that both in Austria and in Hungary the pi-esent spirit favours a policy of annexations.   sBulgaria. In a telegram from J army of March 1st, forwarded by Lord Bertie on March 5th, the opinion is expressed that, in the proposed peace conditions to be imposed by the Central PowTers on Rumania there is a demand that the Dobrudja shall be ceded to the Quadruple Alliance, not to Bulgaria, and that the reason for this-is to give the Central Powers a chance of levying blackmail on Bulgaria and to play off Rumania and Bulgaria against each other as rivals.   (See also footnote on page 1.1.)France. Lord Bertie on March 1st reports an enthusiastic reception in the French. Press of Mr. BalfouPs reply to Court Hertling.On the same date he reported the intention of M. Pichon to read out, at Sorbonne, instructions sent to the German Ambassador in Jidy 1914 to demand the handing over to Germany of the fortresses of Tool and Verdun, which would be restored after the signature of peace, as a condition for acceptance of neutrality demanded, from France.Lord Bertie attended the meeting at Sorbonne. Full accounts of the pro-ceedings there have appeared in the Press. An article in the Temps on the subject . of M. Piohohs revelation states that there will only be lasting peace on earth, on the day that France retakes her territories and her children. M. Pichon read out the celebrated letter of October 1870 from the German Emperor to the Empress Eugenie in which it was stated that Germany took Alsace-Lorraine as a defensive measure against future aggression by France. On March 2nd Lord Bertie forwarded further-extracts showing the deep indignation excited in&apos;the French Press by the German methods as revealed by M. Pichon.On March 5th he called attention to an article in the Temps calling on the Allies to protest solemnly against the Brest Treaty, imposed by ultimatum, and not as a result of negotiation, preceded by armistice.Belgium. Sir E. Villiers, on March 1st, explained that the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs issued his notice to the Press, replying to Count Hertling&apos;s appeal, because he had received so many enquiries from newspapers and from other sources, and a delay in replying might indicate that the Belgian Government was hesitating on the subject (see Appendix).Italy. The Intelligence Bureau on March 1st reported that the alarm reported to-have been produced by the interpretation put upon Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s and President. Vviisohs New Year speeches had subsided by the time that Parliament assembled,, and, since that date, the movement towards an understanding with the Slavs had made good progress.Vatican. Mr. Gaisford on March 3rd reports a fear on the part of the. Russian Minister (who was one of those whom Kererisky appointed) that the Vatican may give recognition to the peace treaty between the Central Powers and Russia. This action might, in his opinion, be harmful to the Entente.Serbia. Sir W. Townley on March 5th gave an account of reported advances to the Austrian Government by a representative of Serbia with certain peace suggestions, of which the substance was indicated.   A reply is stated to have been given by the-
Austrian Minister. In this reply no objection is said to have been raised to Serbia and Montenegro being incorporated with each other, or to their being given access to the sea, but extensive concessions in Macedonia were demanded in arrangement with Bulgaria.   A. desire on the part of -Hungary to have Belgrade is reported.Switzerland.   Sir H. Rumbold on March 2nd reports elation expressed in. some of the Swiss Press about the last speech made by Count Hertling. The German papers in Switzerland say that the generosity of Count Hertling is in marked contrast with Americans failure to send corn&quot;to Switzerland.Sweden. German. Wireless of March 1st published the contents of an article in the Stockholm Tidningen, of February 27th, discussing Count Hertling&apos;s speech, and gaining from it the impression that progress had been made towards real negotiations which should not be too hard for either side.Great Britain. The Ministry of Labour, in their report for the week ending on February 27th, drew attention to the capital importance of the programme of the London Interallied Labour and Socialist Conference, as indicating an emphatic departure from the &quot; peace-at-airy-price &quot; school which had seemed to have gained, so much in Great Britain during the past few months. The alterations to the original Labour Party&apos;s draft are ail in the direction of stiffening its demands. The hardening of opinion is attributed (I.) to the Bolshevists having been discredited by their actions, and (2) to the naked demonstration of Avar aims afforded by the Germans in their methods in Russia. Contact with the views of democratic parties of other countries has been another factor modifying the views originally expressed by British labour.GENERAL.Dropping of Pamphlets by Airmen. The Netherlands Minister in Berlin has been requested to inform the German Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government has, never condemned any German aviator for acts similar to those charged against Lieutenants Scholtz and Wookey.   (See Report No. 54.)Hospital Shi.ps.-The Foreign Office instructs Sir A. Hardinge to notify the King of Spain that the Hospital Ship &quot;Glenart Castle &quot; was sunk, most probably by torpedo, oil February 26th. No reply has yet been received, from -the German. Government concerning the Hospital Ship &quot; Rewa,&quot; in regard to which the Spanish Ambassador in. Berlin communicated a protest in January last.Interned Civilians. In a Memorandum (G.T. 3744) dated January 31st, proposals are put forward for the exchange of British and German interned civilians. As the numerical balance is strongly against Great Britain, it is suggested that the Germans should be invited to agree to the internment in Holland of a certain number of British privates captured in 19.14.Food for British Prisoners. Sir R. Paget, on behalf of the Danish Red Cross, enquires whether, under the recent prohibition of payments to neutrals for food supplied to British prisoners of war, the sending of butter, eggs, &amp;c, direct from Denmark to British prisoners in Germany is to be discontinued.Invalid Prisoners. Pending the assent of the German Government to the intern-ment of invalid prisoners of war in Switzerland, it has been arranged that British and German prisoners of war eligible under paragraph 7 of The Hague Agreement shall be sent to Holland.Civilians from. Germany for internment in Holland. &quot;With reference to the refusal by the Germans to provide passports to civilian prisoners arriving from Germany for internment in Holland (see Report No. 57), the Netherlands Foreign Office has informed the German Government that it cannot in future consent to the internment of prisoners not so provided.
APPENDIXTOWestern and General Report No. 58.   Part II.Speech delivered in the Reichstag by the Imperial Chancellor, Count Hertling, on February 25th, 1918, as reported in German Wireless, in the Press, and by Sir W. Townley. (February 25th-26th.)Introduction. Count Hertling began his speech with a plea that &quot; qualifiedand responsible representatives of the belligerent countries&quot; should &quot; come together in a closer circle mutual! j- to express their views.&quot; lie quoted Mr. Walter Runcimau as being in favour of this procedure.[The Times of February 27th publishes a leading article interpreting these overtures as a &quot; peace offensive &quot; in the West, conducted on the lines of the procedure which produced so effective an influence on the military situation in the East.]Belgium, &quot; We are not thinking of keeping Belgium, and of making Belgium a part of the German Empire, but, however, as has also been explained in the Papal Note of August 1st of last year, we must be shielded from the danger that the country with which we wish to live in peace and friendship after the war, may become the object.or starting point of enemy machinations.&quot;&quot;II a proposal in this direction were to come from the other side, perhaps from the Government at Le Havre, we should not adopt an attitude of refusal even though the discussions, as is obvious, could not be binding.&quot;[Baron de Uroqueville, the Belgian Prime Minister, has replied to this appeal, in an interview, reported in the Times of March 2nd. He refers to the reply sent to the Pope on December 21th. &quot; The integrity of Metropolitan and Colonial territory, &quot; political, economic, and military independence, without any condition or restriction, &quot; reparation for damage done, guarantees against a repetition of the aggression of &quot; 1911 such are the indispensable conditions of a just peace as far as Belgium is &quot; concerned.&quot; And he adds that the Belgian Gov-ernment will only discuss peace terms in concert with those of the Powers, guarantors of her independence, which honoured their engagements towards Belgium.]President Wilson. Count Hertling expressed in general terms his agreement with the four principles laid down by President Wilson in his speech of February 11th (Appendix to. Western Report No. 56, Part IP), and. said that the speech &quot;perhaps represents a slight step towards a mutual approachment.&quot; He welcomed joyfully the Presidents reference to the Balance of Power. &quot;It is well known that it is &quot; England who invented the principle of the maintenance of the balance of power in &quot; order to make use of it when one of the European States threatened to become too &quot; powerful for her liking, and it is onlv another expression meaning the domination &quot; of England.&quot;Referring to the proposed League of Nations, he thought that President Wilson &quot;in his flights of idealism has gone far beyond the existing facts .... as yet &quot; not one of all the nations will keep the peace in the name of justice, as laid down &quot; by a court of arbitration.&quot;In tlie name of the German Empire and her allies, Count Hertling declines to accept the tribunal of the whole world, as being a prejudiced one, but he woidd &quot; welcome the bringing into existence of an impartial, court of arbitration.&quot;[The inference from the last two extracts is clear. Germany would tolerate the establishment of such a court, but would not obey its dictates. This is fully in accordance with the creed of the Great General Staff, who dominate German policy. Comp. Clemsewitz-&quot; self-imposed restrictions, almost imperceptible and hardly worth mentioning, termed usages of international law.&quot;]German War Aims. &quot; Our war aims from the beginning have been the defence of &quot; the Fatherland, the maintenance of our territorial integrity, and the.freedom of our &quot; economic development in every direction.&apos;/[The first two allegations have been made consistently without proof from the beginning of the war.   The third, has recently been emphasised by the Kaiser, von.
Kuhlmaun, and others. It has been illustrated by the facts. This is the most definite official statement that it was Germany&apos;s Avar aim &quot;from the beginning.&quot; No explanation is given of the manner in which Germanys &quot;freedom of economic development in every direction.&quot; was checked in any way before the war; The inference, from the treatment of Russia and the Ukraine, is that Germany&apos;s principal war aim &quot; from the beginning &quot; has been to gain economic advantages at the expense of her neighbours by military conquest over them.]Ukraine, Courland, Livonia and Esilionia. Court Hertling, in a triumphant tone,, announced that successful &quot;military action in the East&quot; bad enabled Germany to substitute an ultimatum for the peace terms offered at Brest-Li to vsk, and that &quot; our &quot; conditions have been accepted. Never, perhaps, before in history has Aristotle&apos;s -&quot; saying that we must be determined on war for the sake of peace had such brilliant &quot; confirmation.&quot; [These conditions were published by Russian and by German&apos; Wireless. See also Western Reports 50 and 57, Part If., and this week&apos;s for demands added subsequently.]Rumania.-&quot;It is our duty to further the just interests of our loyal Allies,. Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and to reach a settlement of desires- which, may, perhaps, be conflicting.&quot;Poland. &quot; This country has been freed by the united efforts of Germany and &quot; Austria from oppressive dependence of Czaristic Russia, with the intention of calling &quot; into being an independent State . . . &quot;. the question of the system of government &quot; of the new State could not, it wdll be understood, be decided at once. .... In &quot; settling the frontier cpiestion, only what is indispensable on military grounds will be &quot; demanded by Germany.&quot; [&quot;Military grounds,&quot; &quot;strategic reasons,&quot; &amp;c, are preferred by German speakers to the more definite expression &quot; annexations.&quot; See-also reference to &quot; strategic protections &quot; by the London Labour and Socialist Conference Western. Report, No. 57, Part II., p. 11.]Alsace-Lorraine. &quot;There is no Alsace-Lorraine question in the international sense.   If there is such a question, then, it is purely a German question.&quot;Alleged Italian. War Aims. &quot; Fighting to separate Palestine, Syria, and Arabia &apos; from the Turkish Kingdom.&quot;&quot; The Entente is fighting in order that Italy may acquire Austro-Hungarian territory.&quot;Alleged British War Aims. &quot;Still absolutely of an Imperialistic nature.....When England speaks of the right of self-determination, she never thinks of applying the principle to Ireland, Egypt, or India,&quot;&quot;It is especially 011 Turkish territory that England has cast her eye.&quot;&quot; That EnglancTs Colonial war aims are directed to the increasing and rounding off of her enormous possessions, especially in Africa, has been stated repeatedly by. English statesmen.&quot;German!/ and Switzerland. &quot; Never for a single moment have we thought of such a thing as to tamper with. Swiss neutrality, nor ever will, we think of such a thing.&quot;[Compare official assurances given publicly by German statesmen and diplomatists,, up to; July 3.1st, 1914, about respecting BelgiwSi neutrality.],   Peroration.-&quot; The world is yearning for peace,&quot; &amp;c, &amp;c.[Count Hertl.ing&apos;s own explanation of the treatment of Russia shows that this must be a peace based upon the victory of the German arms, and the realisation of a war aim of &quot;economic development in every direction.&quot; Speaking in the name of the GJerman Empire and her Allies, he is unwilling to submit the German case to a tribunal of the whole world, as suggested by President Wilson.] Count Hertling follows up this statement by a misleading allusion to Lord milner&apos;s speech, at Plymouth. [From reports available it seems that only mutilated extracts from Lord milner&apos;s speech, accompanied by officially inspired comments, have been allowed to reach the German peojDle.]N.B. Count Hertling was dealt with by Mr. Balfour in the House of Commons on. february 27th.G. G. A.March 2nd, 1918. 1
