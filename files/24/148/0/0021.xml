PART II.   FOREIGN AND GENERAL.GENERAL.Far East: Yladivostoek : The Allies and the Bolshevists. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Derby&apos;to request the French Government to arrange that the French Minister at Peking shall conform with the attitude of the British and United States Governments, in modifying the embargo to allow of supplies as far as the districts controlled by Semenoff (see Report No. 69). The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading and Sir C. Greene to urge upon the United States and Japanese Governments the importance of instructing their representatives at Vladivostock to resist by force if necessary the removal thence of war material by Bolshevist agents. The Bolshevist Government has informed iVI. Litvinoff of a statement, by Count Mirbach to the effect that, under a secret treaty between England aud Japan, the latter was to be given the whole of Siberia as far as Omsk. The Foreign Office has instructed Mr. Lockhart that the allegation a good example of German methods has no foun-dation in fact. In a Memorandum, G.T. 4617, it is pointed out that any vigorous interventionist policy must be ultimately inconsistent with a policy of recognition for the Bolshevists, since it must aim at diverting the energies of the nation from class warfare to national warfare, and at re-establishing order aud discipline in the country. A&apos; report from a military source explains the recent communique of the French Ambassador, M. Noulens (which was the subject of strong protests by the Bolshevists) as having been aimed against any Allied recognition of the Soviet Government ; in the opinion of M. Noulens, such recognition would be a ?confession of weakness, and would bring upon the Allies the greatest discredit amongst all the non-Bolshevist parties in Russia.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period May 17th-23rd, inclusive, was 56,196 tons gross, of which 3.1,164 were British, as compared with 65,920 tons gross, of which 35,541. were British, reported last week.Steam Goal. In a Memorandum (G.T.. 4037), dated May 24th, the Shipping Controller draws attention to the importance of increasing the supply of steam coal for export from the United Kingdom.German Prize Court Regulations and Dutch Shipping. dire Vaz Dias Bress Bureau issued in the Dutch Bress on May 18th the following statement alleged to emanate from an authoritative German source : &quot; The new Order has become necessary owing to the requisition and acquisition by other methods of neutral shipping by the Associated Governments. Its object is to prevent further neutral shipping now in neutral harbours coming uuder their control. Germany will, however, gladly co-operate in finding a solution, in order that Dutch ships may be able to sail by special arrangement. For this purpose, the following system has been prepared. Germany is ready to issue a safe-conduct for every ship which leaves a Dutch harbour if it carries no contraband and no enemy subjects, and if a similar ship returns to Holland to replace it. This exchange could take place on the &apos; final clearance system/ that is, when the exchange ship in the overseas harbour has been cleared the outgoing ship can leave the Dutch harbour. The condition is, however, attached that an assurance must be obtained from, the Associated Governments that the overseas ship shall not be held up, and that all necessary facilities will be given ; while it is obvious that this assurance may not be made dependent upon any limitations or conditions from which the Associated Governments could derive advantage. For every outgoing ship a safe-conduct will be issued by Germany in each separate case. This is necessary, since only in this way can any unhindered voyage be assured.   A
Hague message (May 23rd) states that the Dutch Minister in Berlin, Baron Geversv has informed his Government of the latest alteration in German prize rules, which is in full extent applicable to Dutch shipping. The standpoint taken is that ships laid up do not count. The tonnage in Dutch ports is, therefore, deducted, and the con-clusion is reached, that the greater part of Dutch shipping is navigating in the service of the Associated Governments. It is, however, pointed out, first, that there is no question of attacks without warning or destruction outside the so-called danger zone; and secondly, that the difficulties raised by Germany would vanish if an arrangement-were reached regarding the conditions on which Germany would be ready to grant Dutch ships a safe-conduct.&quot;   (See also Reports Nos. 67 and 68.)Repotted German-Italian Agreement for Exchange of Prisoners. German Wireless of May 24th reports : &quot; The German-Italian agreement regarding the exchange of war prisoners and civilian prisoners was signed at Berne on May 15th. According to this agreement the seriously wounded and seriously ill war prisoners, as well as the hospital staffs, will, on a mutual basis, be repatriated immediately. Furthermore, men of over 45 years of age who have large families, and a number of prisoners who have been, in prison over 18 months will be exchanged. Sir R. Rodd reports that the German&quot; Delegates refused to negotiate unless the repatriation of fit men was discussed. Ultimately, it was arranged that they should be exchanged, man for man, in corresponding ranks, in the case of prisoners upwards of 45 years of age, or between 40 and 45 if fathers of at least three children.&quot;Proposed Anglo-German Agreement for exchange of Prisoners. The Foreign Office ^ ^jj/n^has made a communication through the Netherlands Government, asking whether the ^-fGerman Government would be prepared to discuss and enter into some agreement for J-tAA l^    ^the exchange of prisoners of war, based on the lines of the french Agreetnent. &apos;Arrangements are being made for a conference to be held at The Hague regarding the *  y&amp;jp&amp;Piquestions of general repatriation or internment of prisoners, transport to Europe of &quot;   oia*German prisoners interned in British Colonies, and reprisals. $2*22?&apos;       ^$ ^A,^CALLIED  GROUP.CoBELGIUM.The Flemish Question. The Daily Review reports : Further confirmation has been published of division and confusion, in the Activist camp. In the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Gourant (May 3.m.), L. du Castillon, writing in the Belgisch Dagblad, is quoted as dividing the Flemings into the following groups, formed since the war : (1) Belgicists, the overwhelming majority.   They are faithful to the King and scrupulous observers of the party truce ; they oppose all attempts to divide the country, and advocate national unity founded on perfect equality, both&apos; in the interests of Belgium and of the peace of Europe..  They abhor all forms of separation.   The Belgisch Dagblad agrees with them ;(2) Passivists and Activists have now Combined into one group, since the war map has become more favourable to Germany ;(3) Opportunists, or the followers of Van Can welaert, Vauden per re and Huysmans among the refugees. They have advocated various schemes of separation, either in the army or in the schools, and are not averse from making the language question international;(4) The Activists themselves are divided into Unionists, who want a merely economic union between Flanders and Wallonia, and whose views are represented by the Eendracht and by the Gazet van Brussel ; and
(5) The Young Flemings, also called Si mi Feiners, who are more radical and want complete separation from the Walloons and a Customs Union with Germany. Their leaders are Rene cle Clercq, de Cneuclt, Verhulst and Borms ; their papers the Vlaamsche Nieuws and Ons Land. Most Activists are pan-Netherlanders, and foolishly imagine that Holland may give them political or military assistance.   (See also The Neio Europe of May 23rd, at page 129.)mTubercidosis. A reliable report estimates the increase of deaths in Belgium due to tuberculosis during the war at 100 per cent, at least, and the diminution of births at 50 per cent. The increase of cases affected with or predisposed to tuberculosis by food conditions cannot be less than 300 per cent, or 400 per cent.German Courts in Belgium. With reference to the forcible establishment of German courts in Belgium (see Report No. 63), German Wireless of May 22nd states : &quot; ddie Brussels correspondent of the Vossische Zeitung, writing on the subject of the strike of Belgian judges and the consequent erection of Gierman courts, says :  ddie great majority of Belgian advocates and judges have no sympathy wdiatever with the proceedings of the super-patriots, and if they had not. been afraid of being written down as unpatriotic there would have been an open revolt long ago. It was not from, high principle, but from purely personal considerations that the highest Belgian judges allowed themselves to be induced to take action on political lines, which does not injure the Germans in occupation, but the Belgian people. A few fire-brands thought that they could embarrass the German. Administration by causing a few hundred, criminals to remain unprosecuted for a certain time. They have found themselves very much mistaken ; and if German judges now dispense justice in the glorious Palais de Justice in Brussels instead of Belgian judges, the super patriots may take the credit for it. For three and a half years Belgian judges, without interference from the German Administration, have dispensed justice there, and if they have now lost a good deal of their prestige among the Belgian people a prestige which they have held for scores of years the)7 are indebted for it solely to a few agitators.&quot;BRAZIL.Coal. Sir A. Peel reports that the inability of the S.S. Purus to obtain a cargo of coal at Cardiff for the Brazilian Lloyd (except, ultimately, through the French Government) has been the subject of a semi-official communique in the Brazilian Lhess.CHINA.Deportation of Enemy Aliens. ddie Foreign Office instructs Count de Saiis to inform the Vatican that His Majesty&apos;s Government will carefully consider its representations regarding the proposed deportation of enemy aliens from China (see Report No. 69).Reported Japanese Loan Agreement.--Sir J. Jordan reports that negotiations are believed to be in progress for a Japanese loan to China secured upon a monopoly of wine and tobacco, and assuring to Japan a dominant interest in the production and sale of tobacco in China.COSTA RICA,Declaration of War on Germany. The Foreign Office learns that the Govern-nient of Costa Rica, under authority-from Congress, has declared that a state of war exists as from May 23rd between Costa Rica and Germany. It is reported that this step is partly due to the fact that local German influence is supporting a revolutionary movement which is being prepared in Nicaragua under Senor Castro Quesada, The Costa Rican Minister in Paris has communicated to Lord Derby an assurance of the solidarity of the Republic with the British Empire and the Allies.CUBA.   (See under &quot; Mexico.&quot;)
FRANCE.Strikes. The Foreign Office learns&apos;that the Lyons strike ended by&apos; May 24th, but that those in the Loire districts, largely fomented by anarchists, were still continuing. Military intervention at St. Etienne was cheered, by the Arsenal work-men ; martial law has now been proclaimed there, and it is hoped that the strike will shortly be ended. German Wireless of May 25th, referring to the-recent strikes in Paris munition works, quotes a request by M. Thomas in Humanite for a statement of French war aims, and adds:  &quot;From these words of the Socialist Leader, Thomas, who is otherwise so cautious, it is to be&apos; seen that in. the strike of the last few clays, which was kept secret, a chief part was played by the question : why are we still lighting ? &quot;ITALY.Third Anniversary of Italian Entry into War. Sir R. Rodd reports that the third anniversary of Italy&apos;s entry into the war was celebrated on May 24th in a remarkable demonstration at the Augusteum, at which messages of solidarity were delivered by the Allies. The Prince of Wales, representing the British Empire, was accorded a most enthusiastic reception. The proceedings are described at length in Italian Wireless of May 25th, which also reports a ceremony at the Victor Emmanuel Monument, at which the Czecho-Slovak legions took the oath of loyalty, and their standards were consecrated. At the Argentine Theatre, the National Defence Group met in Congress, and there were present representatives of the Trente-Trieste Association, the Czecho-Slovak National Council, and the invaded Brovinces. German Wireless of May 24th disparages the position of Italy in the Alliance, and quotes &quot;An English politician&quot; as describing her as &quot;a lump of lead on Englancbs foot &quot; which &quot; serves no purpose but only uses up foodstuffs, coal and tonnage &quot; ; on May 25th it somewhat inconsistently remarks that: &quot; She must now not only manage without Franco-British reinforcements, but must herself spare some of her reserves to relieve Foch, who is so hard pressed.&quot;JAPAN.Japan and Germany. The May number of the American Review Outlook is reported to contain a somewhat sensational interview given to its representative by the Japanese Prime Minister. In reply to an enquiry as to the possibility of a German-Japanese alliance after the war, the Prime Minister is quoted as saying: &quot; That will depend on how the war may end. If the exigencies of international relationship demand it, Japan, being unable to maintain a position of total isolation, may be induced to seek an ally in Germany.&quot; This reply is severely criticised in the Japanese Press.NICARAGUA.Economic Results of Declaration of War. Military sources report that the German share of trade with Nicaragua is likely to pass to the United States, which are already largely interested in the finance and commerce of that country.PORTUGAL.Election Results. According to the Secido (May 19th), the final scrutiny in the Portuguese elections leaves the results as follows : Chamber of Deputies : 108 Republicans, 39 Monarchists, 8 Catholics. Senate: 67 Republicans, 7 Monarchists, 3 Catholics. [The Republicans mentioned here are the new Governments Party- the National Republicans.]5081-6b B
GUNITED STATES,Amendment of Army Bill. The Daily Review reports that on May 23rd Mr. Baker, Secretary for War, appeared before the Military Committee of the House of Repre-sentatives in connection with a plan to amend the Army Bill in such a manner that President Wilson will be given unlimited authority as to the number of men who may be called up. The law as it stands limits the President to summoning approximately a million men for general service. As the meed of a great army in Erance develops, it has become apparent, says the Washington Post (May 24th), to the War Department officials that the law must be extended. The purpose of the amendment &quot;which Mr. Baker placed before the Committee is to remove all restrictions and to provide an army as large as may be needed to defeat Germany, whether it is five millions or ten millions. The Military Committee of the House of Representatives unanimously adopted Mr. EakePs recommendation, which will be incorporated in the Army Bill. According to the Evening Post (May 24th), following the action of the Military Committee of the House of Representatives on May 23rd in adopting Mr. BakeFs recommendation to give President Wilson unlimited authority to call up men, the Senate Military Committee unanimously voted in favour of a large expansion of the American Army, and ordered a favourable report to be submitted on the resolution of Mr. Reed, a Senator for Missouri, declaring in favour of an increase of 3,000,000 men in the United States Army.Compulsory War Work. The Washington Post of May 23rd reports that under the far-reaching regulations announced by the Provost-Marshal, General Crowder, every man of draft age must either work or fight after July 1st. &quot; Every man at. draft age, at least, must work or fight. This is not alone a war of military manoeuvres, it is a deadly contest of industries and mechanics. Germany must not be thought of as merely possessing an army. We must think of her as being an army, an army wherein every factory and loom in the Empire is a recognised part in a complete machine running day and night at terrific speed. We must make of ourselves the same sort of effective machine.&quot;American Opinion on the Irish Situation. In - a despatch dated May 3rd, Lord Reading sums up as follows the United States view of the present Irish situation : &quot; It appears that, far from according that support which in the past Nationalist appeals have always received, American opinion definitely states that Ireland will forfeit all her ancient friendship and present goodwill from America, if in the hour of need Ireland carries her opposition to Great Britain to the point of refusing that duty which Irishmen in every other part of the world have so readily accepted. If Home Ride be granted and put into operation, it will remove the chief excuse for the traditional quarrel between the two countries.&quot; Lord Reading further reports that a strong attitude has been adopted by Cardinal Parley in. the New York Archdiocese, and by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Chicago and Bishop of San Antonio, Texas.Enemy Property. The Custodian of Alien Property has delivered a speech at Detroit dealing with the eventual disposal of 400,000,000^- worth of German property in the United States. He declared that this property had been accumulated in pur-suance of a hostile policy of penetration. Two hundred large German corporations had been formed for the execution of a sinister German plan to control the United. States economically and politically. These corporations had permeated every artery of American industry. &apos; They were now being administered efficiently under the Alien Proxjerty Custodian Act, and were earning enormous profits which ought not to be given to the enemy, who should be made to understand how dismally her plans had failed.Arrival of Prince Arthur of Gonnaughi. Mr. Bay ley reports the arrival ofBrince Arthur of Con naught at New York on May 24th. Lord. Reading reports his. departure on May 26th from Washington after a most successful visit.
ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUN GARY.Nationalities of Austria-Tfungary and the Habsburg Policy. In a Memorandum!. (G.d\ 4029) dated May 6th, the Political Intelligence Department points out the limitations Imposed upon the political independence of the Emperor Charles hy the heterogeneity sof his possessions and the ultimate predominance of Germany.   The first aim of every national movement is national unity in a sovereign state.   Of the eight nationalities which   inhabit Austria-Hungary,   six   (the   Germans,   Italians, Jugo-Slavs, Rumanians, Ukrainians, and Poles) have seen national states of their own grow up across the frontier;  two&quot; only (the  Magyars and Czecho-Slovaks)   are contained   within the borders   of   the   Monarchy.   Every single   adjacent   State sees  unredeemed   national  territory  of   its  own  included in  Austria-Hungary. Thus, the great  majority within the Monarchy  seek inclusion within their own national   States,   while   the   border   States  are  unwilling  to  acquiesce  in   the continued division of their national territory.   Since it is inconceivable that, e.g., Italy, the Ukraine, or the whole of Rumania should ever  find  union under the Habsburg sceptre, it follows that their &quot;respective national  movements cannot be reconciled with the dynastic interests of the Habsburgs.   Of those which can find such union, some are non-competing, e..g., Magyars, Poles, and Germans.   On the other hand,   Ozecho-Slovak,  and  Jugo-Slav  unity,   while not incompatible   with Habsburg interests, could   not   be   reconciled  with those   of   the   Germans   or Hungarians.   In Galicia the claims of the Poles and Ukrainians are antagonistic ; the interests of the latter conflict also with those of the Magyars : hence the Poles have usually to he added to the  German-Magyar group, the  Ukrainians to that of the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs.    But what was left  of  the Habsburg inheritance in 1867 was not altogether amorphous,   ddie residue of their d.ynastic possessions concided with the historic inheritance of the Magyar nation and of the Austrian Germans and with part of the historic inheritance of the Poles, none nationally pure, each based on an Imperialist claim and on violence against other nations.   When recognised as heirs and masters   in.  their own historic preserves, the German, Magyar and Polish hiationalists acquire an interest as keen as athe Habsburgs them-selves in defending the frontiers of their dynastic possessions against their neigli-bours Italy, Serbia, Rumania and Russia.     ddie Czecho-Slovaks can never feel much interest&quot; for the drentino or Transylvania, and they sympathise with Russia and Serbia,   ddie Jugo-Slavs can never be trusted altogether, because even complete union within the Habsburg Monarchy would not accomplish the union of their race. This is the first reason why the German-Magyar group is the more natural ally of the Habsburgs than its Slav rivals could ever be.   Secondly, it is to the interest of Germany and the German-Austrians to maintain the Habsburg Monarchy, provided it preserves its   German-Magyar character.    ddie Germans, Magyars, and Poles &apos; together have proved sufficiently strong to keep clown their opponents within the Habsburg Monarchy, while the German   alliance has so far proved a sufficient safeguard against Austria-Hungary&apos;s neighbours.   No other combination within the Habsburg dominion could supply the dynasty with, equal safeguards.    Thirdly; dominion of one nation over another exercised in the past usually means social and economic predominance in. the present : such, a predominance is held by the Magyars in Hungary and the Poles in Galicia.   In 1867, of all the nationalities in the Habsburg Monarchy, the Germans, Magyars and Poles alone had upper and middle classes fit to carry on a socially conservative constitutional regime, and this is the case at the present time.    Were the Habsburgs to lean on the other group, they would have to be prepared to lead peasantries against their landlords, and an industrial proletariat against the capitalists-more than anyone can expect from an ancient dynasty and the clicpue of aristocrats, bishops, generals and high officials by which they are sur-rounded.   The dominion of the German, Magyar and Polish upper classes over the other nationalities is intimately bound up with their dominion over their own peasants and workmen, and is protected by the power of the German Empire, the general guardian of Conservative interests in Eastern Europe.   (See aZso Reports Nos. 61-63 :and 66-69, the Times of May 28th at page 5, and The Neio Europe oi May 23rd at p. 136.)
Germany and the Austro-Germans. The Rhenish clerical organ, the Kolnlsche T&apos;olkszeltung, declares that things are happening in Austrian domestic politics which can only be described as symptoms of a serious crisis. In the Slav camp extensive circles are coming forward undisguised with special demands, the aim of which is the separation of the whole State territories from Austria. The A7ienna Cabinet has to some extent contemplated with folded arms the treasonable effort to get outside the Black and Yellow frontier posts. The Czech and Jugo-Slav Parties&apos; challenge to the Government aud Parliament is significant proof of the extent to which the policy of laissez faire and forbearance has suffered shipwreck. The &quot;-Masaryks &quot; are showing themselves more insatiable iu their claims the more conciliation is shown towards-them. The journal adds : &quot; To this must be added the Goverumenfs mistakes in the domain of food administration ; the provisioning of the German regions as-compared with others exhibits very step-motherly treatment. In such circumstances it is nof surprising that embitterment among the German population in Austria has gradually risen to boiling point. Not merely in German Bohemia, but also in Tirol,, ever clearer signs of conflagration may be observed.&quot;Contrasting Czech enthusiasm at the May celebration with German, depression, the Prague correspondent of Krupp&apos;s organ, the Rheinish Westfcilisclie Zeitung, declares that German Bohemia is confronted by starvation. The thickly populated German, mountain frontier regions, with their industry, are- being completely starved out owing to the incapacity of the Austrian administration. &quot; This German people in Bohemia has offered blood and treasure as no other German tribe, and how has tire Government rewarded it ? Disease and infant mortality are increasing to an enormous degree. The Czernin&apos; crisis was the stone that set the avalanche rolling.. Anyone who has recently participated in political meetings in German Bohemia from Trantenau in the Riesengebirge to Eger, and who attended the mass meeting at Lobositz, has heard with equal bitterness and indignation the complaint of a starved and betrayed people, and the same echoes from Tirol and Styria. German Austria has fought, and still lights, A.ustria&apos;s war. In it is anchored the fidelity to the alliance with the racially related German Empire. Here is the unshakable will to hold out till the German sword has struck the last decisive blow in the West. This will is to be weakened by starvation. Dark influences are working to cripple the will to victory of this German corner pillar, and to ripen it for a renunciation peace. If this scornful cry, full of indignation and bitterness, finds deaf ears in Vienna, the imploring entreaty of a deserted tribe will certainly not be in vain in the ear of the All-Mother Gerrnania, the cry for thanks for so much blood shed, for Gorman greatness in the future, the cry for a bit of bread. German Wireless of May 28th reports that the foundation of a *German National Council for Austria, with a National Council Chancery, has been decided, upon by the representatives of the German National Councils of Bohemia, Power Austria, Styria, Oarniola, Tirol and the coastal countries of Galicia.Demonstrations at Prague. The German Press reports considerable disorders at Prague at Whitsunside. These are described as an uprising of the Czechs with their South Slav, Pan-Polish, Polish-Socialist and Italian sympathisers, against the Austrian State and the Habsburg Monarchy, and as a demonstration against the consolidation of the Austro-German Alliance, and in favour of the aims of the Entente Powers. It, is added that the Parliamentary Committee of Czechs is in constant contact with Poles, Italians and South Slavs, for the purpose of organising resistance to the Prague decrees dividing Bohemia into self-administering districts (see Report No. 69). As the result of police measures, order has been restored in the town ; these measures have been the subject of a protest to the Austrian Premier by Stanek and M. Tomas-chep, two members of the Peichsrath.Central Powers and Poland. The British Press issues the following statement &quot;from an authoritative Polish source&quot; with regard to the agreement between the Central Powers for a solution of the Polish question: &quot;The agreement consists in giving a large portion of Russian Poland to Austria. Of these two divisions of Poland, the Russian and the Austrian, a new State will be formed under the Habsburg sceptre.. It is obvious that such a solution can never satisfy the Polish nation. Such a Poland, wordd be neither independent nor united. Prussia intends not only to keep her Polish Provinces, which are inhabited by 4,000,000 Poles, but aims at &apos; regulating her frontier &apos; by seizing certain parts of Russian Poland. The vast majority: of the - nation is against such a solution.   In the recent, elections for the Council of State in.
9J   f,7     -Russian Poland, the parties who stand for a united and independent Poland won a f&quot; &apos; ;^ complete victory, gaining 70 per cent, of the seats. Even in Galicia, where the pro-Austrian tendency was the strongest, the programme of unity and independence has succeeded, in winning over public opinion. The movement is so strong in Galicia that Deputies to tlie Reichsrat, belonging to two Democratic parties, the Socialists and (he National Democrats, resigned from the Polish Club of Deputies in Vienna, in which club the Conservatives, who were always too ready to compromise with the Austrian Government, formed a majority. The National Democrats formed a separate club, which club, as its leader, Count Skarbek declared, will strongly oppose the Government of Dr. von Seidler. The National Democrats and the Socialists will, in accordance with the prevailing opinion, in the country, endeavour to come to an understanding with the Slavs of the Monarchy, who have all the same aim of becoming free from the German and Magyar domination. Polish national aspirations, like those of the Rumanians, Serbs, and Czechs, can be satisfied only outside the Habsburg Monarchy, and the Poles have vital political interests against any corn-promise with the llabsburg Monarchy, as this would entail the sacrifice upon the Polish side of Polish territories belonging now to Prussia Silesia, Posen, and Danzig -without which territories it is impossible to organise an independent Polish State.&quot; The A7ienna correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, however, learns that &quot;nothing has yet been decided with regard to uniting the whole or any part of Poland with Austria-Hungary. This depends upon the economic agreements that are to be negotiated during the next few months between Germany and Austria-Hungary. By the terms of these, Germany is to be placed in a not less favourable position in the new Polish territories than Austria-Hungary herself. This means that the incorpora-tion of Poland with Austria depends on the previous creation of a common Central European economic alliance.&quot;Kdrohji on Hungary and the Auslro-German Fact. A Budapest telegram to the Weser-Zeitung says that Count Michael Karolyi, in the course of a speech at Eger (Bohemia), protested against the extension of the alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary. &quot; We are fighting for an independent Hungary. If we can obtain independence for the Ukraine, we ought to claim independence in the first place for Hungary. We desire a Hungary which shall be independent in the political, financial and economic spheres. I therefore protest against any extension of the alliance as it would be an obstacle to our aspirations for independence..&quot; The Frankfurter Zed bung gives an account of a speech by Count Karolyi in the Lower House of the Hungarian Parliament on the same subject. Pie said that the new agreements were-superfluous, as the treaty of 1879 would have been automatically prolonged. &quot; It was clear that it was a question of making entirely new agreements and primarily a strengthening of the alliance, particularly in the economic, military and. financial spheres with a view to developing a &apos; Central Europe.&apos; Pie was against such an alliance on principle, especially during the war. He opposed any grouping. Hungary could only expect benefit from a lasting peace. Their opponents could also form a group and then arms alone would again decide. The result of the alliance would be that Germany would become the head lessee of Austria-Hungary and Austria the sub-lessee of Hungary with a view to sucking it dry.&quot;GERMANY.Germany and the Ukraine. In a Memorandum (G.T. 403d) dated May 17th the Political Intelligence Department points out that the attempted restoration by the Germans of the big landed estates in the Ukraine (due to anxiety for foodstuffs and fear of the spread of Bolshevism) runs counter to Ukrainian national interests and will continue to be fiercely opposed, by arms and perhaps by sabotage possibly with important effects. A reliable source reports that the Central Empires intend to employ 400,000 German, and Austrian soldiers who are prisoners in Russia to collect and transport cereals from the Ukraine. According to the-terms of the present German treaty with the Ukraine the total time during which the guaranteed delivery of grain is to be completed in four months. It appears that the first period of one month has elapsed without the contracting quota being delivered, and that as aDGS] .5b C
consequence the Germans are taking the law into their own hands and arranging to secure supplies direct, instead of working through the Rada Commission : -(ft) The treaty provides that there should be forthcoming during the Jour months April to July 1918 :-April - - 135,000 tons.May .... 240,000   ,,June - - - - - 528,000   ,,July -       . - - 311,000   ,,Total for four months    -      -      -   1,220,000 tons.(b) It is difficult to calculate, as yet, at what rate the Germans will be able to effect transport, but they claim, to have actually removed, at the end of April (vide von Braun&apos;s recent declaration in the Reichstag) .1,000 carloads by rail, say, 16,000 tons, and 800 tons by water; this quantity consists of foodstuffs, fodder, &amp;c, and, though mainly grain, cannot be regarded as exclusively so. It is further stated that 4,000,000 poods, say, 65,000 tons, have been definitely located for collection, but, having regard to difficulties of convey-ance by road to the railways, it may be assumed that a total of 80,000 tons represents the maximum which Germany can hope to obtain by the end of the first two months. Of the total grain to be obtained the proportion represented by wheat cannot at this stage be estimated ; in fact, one delivery of 97 carloads is recorded of which only 10 per cent, was &quot; grain,&quot; and of another consignment of foodstuffs, consisting of 66 carloads, none was described as grain.(c) ddie agreed allocation as between Austri add ungary and Germany for the first two months is two thirds to Austria and one-third to Germany. On this basis, and. taking the total of 80,000 mentioned above as a maximum, Austria-Hungary would obtain 53,500 tons, say, 2&apos;43 (2 lbs. 7 ozs.) per head of population, and Germany 26,500 tons, say, 0&quot;91 lbs. (I4  ozs.) per head of population.Germany and Russia. Mr. Wardrop reports on good authority that the Germans are demanding control of all railway junctions west of the Urals under the pretext of facilitating the return of German prisoners. It is probable that unless Archangel and Vologda are speedily secured by the Allies the Germans will prevent the further export of flax or other goods to the Allies. German Wireless of May 24th reports that the staff of the German Consulate-General arrived in Moscow on May 20th. Mr. Lockhart reports a sudden change in the attitude of the Germans towards the &quot;Bolshevist Government. They have expressed their intention of desisting from, military operations and of entering into economic co-operation. Mr. Lockhart attributes this, first, to difficulties in the Ukraine; secondly, &quot;to the necessity of maintaining troops on the Western front ; thirdly, to the magnitude of the task of reorganising Russia at present ; and finally, to the importance of concentrating upon the South of Russia and the Caucasus.German Penetration into the Caucasus and Turkestan. ddie Foreign Office is informed that the Germans wdll before long have obtained possession of &quot;the Caucasus, which, apart from facilitating possible attacks upon Baghdad and Jerusalem, will put them in a position to secure wool, leather, and cotton from Turkestan. In a Memorandum (G.d\ 4609), dated May 18th, the Political Intelligence points out that they can obtain cereals from Northern Caucasia, oilcake, from Ekaterinodar and Novorossisk. silver-lead, and copper at Grozny, ddie oilfields at Grozny would give them control of the river-boat industry on the Volga, the shipping in. the Caspian, and, in. a measure, Siberia.German Shipping. According to a reliable report, there are now 950,000 tons of merchant vessels now building in Germany for large and medium-sized companies. There is stated to be much activity at Baltic ports. At lubeck  three new shipyards have been constructed. Regular connections have already &quot;been established with Riga and Reval through lubeck . ddiree shipowners of Rostock have placed orders at different yards for the construction of 13 steamers of a total tonnage of 50,000 tons. Four shipowners of Flensburg have ordered steamers of a tonnage of 32,000 tons.   It is also reliably reported that the Germans are arranging
to buy tip tbeDansk Russisk Dampskibsselskab of Copenhagen, with a view to the later employment of its vessels under the Danish flag.   (See also Report No. 69.)Socialist Programme for Reconstruction. According to German -Wireless (May 23rd), the Social Democratic Party Committee publishes a draft programme, . which was drawn up at the Conference of the party at Wurzburg with a view to adapting the policy of the Social-Democratic Party to the new political and economic conditions created by the war. The - draft contains in nine sections extensive proposals and demands which are intended to complete the well-known Erfurt programme. Amongst the political demands are, in addition to the familiar proposals for the uniform introduction of general, equal, secret, and direct suffrage for all the Federal States,&apos; co-operation on the part of the national representation in the appointment and dismissal of the highest State officials and in decisions regarding Avar or peace, the transformation of the standing army into a national&apos; army, the abolition of secret diplomacy, the creation of international legal organizations and the control of the administration with the object of doing away with the monopoly of power on the part of the ruling classes. To meet the period of transition from war conditions to peace, they demand the organization of the provision supply, adequate control over- the imports of raw materials,&apos; provision for exports under State supervision, and the putting of the shipping trade, including canal and river traffic, under State supervision. For the purpose of preventing the sudden overcrowding of the labour market when peace is declared, they call for the s-ystematic distribution of labour, participation of the workmen in the organization necessary for the purpose, and the establishment of labour exchanges. Measures against the creation of monopolies are also demanded, and the supervision of industrial combines by the State. Amongst the trade-political demands, first place is assigned to the measures necessary for the re-establishment with foreign countries of the commercial relations which existed before the war, and also measures for the prevention of an economic war after the war&apos;. Demands are also made for a taxation policy on the old Social-Democratic principles ; the meeting of a considerable part of the war debts by means of severe taxation upon war profits ; the levying of a general contribution on a scale according to the means of the contributors for the payment of the debts of the State ; State regulation of the income and property taxes on Social lines, and the raising of the death duties, as well as the abolition of taxation upon necessaries. The draft closes with the repetition of trie Social-Political demand for an eight-hour day, and also with demands for the exterr-sion of measures for the welfare of the young and for proper housing; for the regulation of trade unions and the extension of the provision for the care of the poor and for orphans in communal administrations, as well as for free education and special provision for those pupils who have special gifts.Problems of Reconstruction. The following summary may be read in conjunction with Reports Nos. 63-08: &quot; The military party and those industrialists who are connected with the manufacture of war materials&apos;, i.e., the iron, steel, coal, and chemical magnates, still believe that &apos; Hindenburg&apos;s sword will decide&apos;; that is to say, that no one need have any fear-about the enormous war debt or the destruction of German overseas trade, as the peace to be imposed on the Entente will contain terms similar to those of the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest, and ample provision will be made for Germany&apos;s needs in raw material for many years to come. The remainder of the industrialist community, however especially those connected with shipping and overseas trade generally is coming to realise with increasing-force that no military victory, short of the annihilation of the Navies, Armies, and Mercantile Fleets of the Allies, as well as the occupation of France and England and the terrorising of the United States, can save German industry from utter ruin. Germany will be dependent for raw material, on her present enemies, and German industry is (with the exception of the coal, iron, steel, potash and dye trades) a &apos; making-up &apos; industry, that is to say, it depends entirely on the import of raw material cheaply, which it makes up cheaply iuto various forms of manufactured articles; these are exported cheaply or &apos; dumped &apos; onto foreign countries. By this process she built up her trade before the Avar.&apos; By a judicious tariff system, she imported cheaply all forms of raw material not provided by herself ; by stimulating agricultural production within her boundaries she reduced the price of living ; and by far-reaching social legislation, providing for insurance and old-age pensions, she  kept  her  labouring classes  comfortable,  and   diverted their attention from.
industrial agitation. Consequently living was cheap, labour was cheap, there was plenty of employment, and foreign trade went ahead rapidly. This state of things is now at an end; the price of living is fabulously high; wages will therefore have to be raised far above peace-time rates if a revolution is to be avoided after the war; the interest, on the National Debt (which will have to be covered by the tax-payer) rises about 25,000,000Z. every three months ; and it will no longer be possible to import raw materials cheaply. In any case, even if they could be imported cheaply, they could not be made up and exported cheaply enough to supplant the products of foreign industry ; and, failing that, German overseas trade comes to the ground. Every link in the chain of her prosperity is broken. This is now being realised by the theoretical economists and the more , thoughtful parliamentarians as well as shipping magnates like Herr Baffin. The danger is threefold: (1.) The threat of an economic, boycott is now taken seriously in Germanofficial circles.....Each step taken by the Allies is followed in Germany with increasing anxiety the purchase of Australian zinc concentrates, the Non-Ferrous Metals Act, the establishment of   the Commercial  Intelligence Department, and the   repudiation    by   Great  Britain   and   France  of   their   most-favoured-nation treaties.   (2) Tlie increase in the Imperial Debt, (quite apart from the State Debt) has, as already pointed out, been estimated at about 500,000,OOOL every three months, and it is now calculated that the sum to be raised by taxation after the war would, if capitalised, amount to more than the entire national -wealth of Germany.   There have been several indications that the increasing burden of war costs is for the first time arousing real anxiety in Government circles.   The German Minister at The Hague is reported to have told the Dutch Government that Germany could not tolerate the seizure of Dutch ships, as she could not afford to pay for the extra months such seizure would add to the war.   The Finnish Government has had to pay the expenses of the German expedition.   Bulgaria has been compelled already to consolidate her war debt to Germany.   Lastly, there have beeu mysterious references in the Bress to a memorandum drawn up by the Imperial Finance Minister, in which, apparently, it was argued that there were limits to the liabilities Germany could with safety impose -upon herself.   It is pointed out on all sides that so great a burden, of debt would hopelessly cripple every kind  of production and enterprise.    Large increases in taxation will be unavoidable ; this will involve a rise in the price of living and. there-fore in wages and on low wages, as we have seen, the success of German foreign trade depended.    Further, Germany will find great difficulty, failing a sweeping military victory, in restoring her exchange, for she has hardly any goods of high value to export.   Lastly, the countries she is allied with are quite unable to give her credits for the assistance of her enterprise.    On the other hand she will have to issue credits to them.   No neutral will be anxious to lend her money in sufficient amounts on deposits of war loan scrip, which is secured on. nothing save her boasted ability to win.   (3) What is more to be feared than anything else, according to many German writers and speakers, is the personal boycott which German merchants may have to expect.   &apos; Our previous methods.have been bitterly resented abroad   ....   The Allies have succeeded in wrecking practically all the work built up overseas.   English influence   has   succeeded in creating an atmosphere of hatred against Germans throughout  the  world.     At present we are inclined  to   disregard this, but our commercial  advance guard will realise it as soon as they try  to  start again.&apos; The following methods  are proposed  by   the  Germans for meeting the dangers described : (1) An indemnity.   (2) Insistence on the insertion of a most-favoured-nation clause in the Peace Treaty.   (3) Concessions of colonial territory.   (-1) Economic exploitation of Russia.   (5) Exploitation of labour opinion in England against the &apos; Capitalist dodge &apos; of an economic war.   (6) Organisation.   (7) Communication with South  America through  neutral firms, especially in  Holland and Spain.   It is recognised in Germany that no organisation is of any use without credit; without the insertion of clauses in the Peace Treaty ensuring equal commercial treatment for all nations ;  and without a fixed supply of raw material.   Since the entry of  the United States into the war an. event which on official admission wrecked the enemy plans for reconstruction credits will be practicably unobtainable.   The two remaining conditions depend on a degree of military success that it seems impossible to attain. Many Germans have therefore decided, for a counsel of desperation.   Knowing they are ruined themselves they will do all the damage they can to their enemies and for as long as they can, hoping thereby to reduce them to the same hopeless condition that, they foresee for themselves.&quot;
Death of Doctor Kaempf. German Wireless of May 26th reports the death of Doctor Kaempf, President of the Reichstag, and member for Greater Berlin. &quot; ddie Advanced People&apos;s party intends to offer the candidature to Herr Dernburg. Many papers point out that the Centre, as the strongest fraction of the Reichstag, rshould demand the office for a member of their party. Of the&apos; Deputies of the Centre the papers mention Groeben and Fehrenback as candidates. The name of Count Posadovvsky, the former Secretary of State, is also mentioned in other -quarters.&quot;Internal Position. -According to a report received by the Foreign Office, life in Berlin is now extremely uncomfortable, ddie official and middle classes appear to be suffering most. To wear good clothes in the streets excites undesirable attention. It is almost impossible to procure boots and shoes. Owing to under nourishment the condition of women of the lower classes is deplorable, ddie authorities seem unable to cope with the numerous robberies committed. Implicit credence is still given to Wolff communiques, and there is general disbelief in the reality of American assistance. Any striking military feat by American soldiers, especially aviators, would create a great impression. Another source reports that both Germany and Austria are thoroughly despondent about the war, but cannot make up their minds to propose an. acceptable peace ; they will, however, be forced to do so if the Allies maintain, a -successful resistance for some time longer.NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.Germany and the Argentine. The Foreign Office learns that the German Government is taking special pains to maintain good relations with the Argentine Government with a Anew to the resumption of trade after the Avar. German. Wireless of May 26th reports that an assembly of members of the Argentine Colony at the Embassy on May 25th Avas attended by many high German State officials, and German Wireless of May 25th quotes a flattering reference by the Norddeutsclie Allgemeine Zeitung to the President as &quot; an incorruptible politician, a farseeing statesman and exemplary patriot.&quot;   (See also Report No. 69.)Projected Acquisition of Tonnage. Sir E. Howard reports that the Argentine GoA-ernment, having been unsuccessful in its endeavour to acquire SAvedish tonnage (-see under &quot; Sweden &quot;), is believed to contemplate obtaining Allied consent to the purchase and employment of German vessels now in Argentine ports.Reported Return of the President. The Press reports that President Irigoyen has uoav returned and will recehre the British Special Mission.DENMARK.Iceland: German Propaganda. German Wireless of May 22nd continues its allegations of British designs upon Iceland. (See Reports Nos. 67 and 69.) &quot; English intentions Avith regard to Iceland are only a part of an. English attempt Avhich has been, in progress during the past few months aud which has become more clear since the conclusion of peace in the East Avith the object of securing the strategic encircle-inent of Scandinavia. The new route for England to Asia is being sought via Spitzbergen to the Kola Peninsula, and the pretended independence of Iceland, represents more than its mere economic subjection to England.&quot;Exports of Cereals. The Foreign Office learns that it is proposed to export from Denmark during 1918, 20,000 tons of cereals to Norway, 15,000 to Sweden, and two -cargoes of A\dieat to Finland. It would thus appear difficult for the Danish Goveru-ment to make out a case for overseas supplies.5(581-51 D
Exemptions from Embargo. The armonncement of the relaxation of the general&quot; embargo (see Report -No. 69) is regarded by the National Tidende (usually pro-Entente) as &quot; bitter irony,&quot; as the goods freed are, with the exception of medical supplies, luxuries and not necessities for Denmark. Similar criticism is made by the Berlingshe Ticlende.FINLAND.General Situation. The Foreign Office learns that General Mannerheim has tendered his resignation, stating that he regards his task as completed. It is not yet clear that it will be accepted. He is reported, nevertheless, to desire the cession by Russia to Finland of the Murman territory for strategic reasons, the new frontier to be Ladoga-Ouega-Gulf of Onega, With regard to the railway, he is said to be in favour of some friendly economic arrangement obviating its inclusion, in hostile Finnish soil. At the same time he does not appear to be much concerned at the-prospect of Russia&apos;s exclusion from the open sea or .that of the Allies from. Russia, Sir E. Howard has intimated to the Finnish Government the danger of offending Russia by cutting off her communication with the sea. The Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires in Stockholm, in reply to the Allied declaration regarding the conditions on which foodstuffs can be supplied, has reiterated to the French Minister the claim of the Finnish Government to liberate Karelia from Finnish or Russian Bolshevists who threaten the borders of Finland, and to comply with the expressed wish of its Finnish population for incorporation with Finland. Accor-cling to information from a Russian source, General Mannerheim is raising, with German, assistance, an army of 200,000 men. with a view to the creation of a larger Finland, including the whole of Karelia and the Murman coast, . According to the-Russian paper ZnamyaLruda, a German Wireless message has been intercepted which refers to a transfer of German troops from Finland to Murman. Air. Grove reports-that the total German force at present in Finland amounts to 13,000 men. Reports, from Helsingfors indicate that, even if the German troops should leave Finland, German influence will predominate for a considerable time, and the election of a German prince to the throne of Finland is almost certain. According to the Finnish Bress, the new constitution drawn up on monarchical lines will be submitted next week by President Swinhufvucl to the Diet. New Ministers for War and Foreign Affairs will forthwith be appointed. It is stated that these will be Senator Stenroth and Colonel Thesloff, and that ex-Senator Paasikivi will be appointed Vice-President. This would indicate the triumph of tlie pro-Germans and the subordination of the Swedish to the Finnish Finns. It would further appear that the Germans.are only waiting for an excuse to enter Petrograd. Mr. Wooclhouse reports that they are prepared to do so within 24 hours if it suits their interests. One of the rumours current in Petrograd refers to the expected, arrival off a German-Finnish Force.. The Swedish Aftonbladet reports that the German Commander-iu-Chief in Finland has requested his Government to soppily Finland with foodstuffs immediately, as enquiry has established a grave shortage. General Mamierheim is reported as stating that relations between Finland and the Allies would be greatly improved if foodstuffs could be provided from Allied sources to Northern. Finland. Mr. Lockhart also submits the political value of such an offer, made conditionally upon German withdrawal.Export of Horses to Germany. It is announced in the Finnish Press that the Senate has accorded the Germans permission to export 1,000 horses, but no mares (see Report No. 69).Military Expenditure. The Finnish Press reports that 38,000,000 marks have-been voted for the military expenses of the current month. It is established that Finland is to pay the cost of the German expedition. Payment may be made in kind. The Government is requisitioning petroleum, benzine, fats, rubber, and coffee.Arrest of British Subjects in Finnish Territory. Sir E. Howard reports that as a result of Finnish representations regarding the arrest of British subjects in Finnish territory (see Reports Nos. 60, 62, 68 and 69), the German Government has declared that they will all be liberated except those considered as spies and Vice-Consul Fawcett, for whom some German Consul arrested, by the British Authorities must be exchanged. - -    -
Embargo on British Balances in Finland. Sir&quot; E. Howard learns that Finnish &quot;banks were on May 23rd instructed not to pay out.any accounts for British subjects, ddie statement of His Majesty-&apos;s Government in regard to this matter (see Report No. 68) is being published in the Swedish and Finnish Press, ddie Foreign Office instructs Sir E. Howard to protest against the embargo as detrimental not only to British interests but also to Finnish industry and Finnish workmen. Failing its withdrawal, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be obliged to reconsider its attitude with regard to Finnish balances in Great Britain.Reported Peace Treaties with Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary. The Vossische Zeitung of May 23rd reports the signature on May 21st of peace between Finland and Bulgaria. A Vienna telegram states that negotiations began there on May 23rd for the conclusion of the peace treaty, and the economic and political supplementary treaties between Austria-Hungary and Finland.   (See also Report No. 69.)Protest by Council of Finnish Workmen. Russian Wireless of May 28th issues a passionate protest by the &quot;Central Committee of Finnish -Workmen-&quot; against &quot;the madness of White Terrorism in Finland,&quot; consequent upon &quot; the victory of the united forces of Finnish Bourgeoisie and Germany.&quot;MEXICO.Strained Relations with. Cuba. ddie Foreign Office learns that the Mexican Charge cVAffaires at Havana has been ordered by his Government to return to Mexico, handing over the archives to the Consulate, ddie Cuban representative in Mexico has been informed that the Mexican Government, while not wishing to sever diplomatic relations, has taken this, step to mark its disapproval of recent occurrences in Cuba. It is reported that this refers to the recent detention of the luggage of Senor Fabela, Mexican Representative en route for the Argentine, and to the alleged interference with the correspondence of the Charge d? Affaires himself. Mr. Leech is informed that the Mexican Government may be considered likely at any moment to provoke hostilities with the United States. A concentration of Mexican Government troops upon the Texas border is reported. Lord Reading reports that the United States Government regards the position with serenity, and takes a hopeful view of relations with Mexico, feeling that in any case Carranza is unlikely to commit himself unless the prospects,of German success become definitely clearer. German Wireless of May 28th reports: &quot; With regard to the events preceding the rupture of diplomatic relations between Mexico and Cuba, the Berlin newspapers learn the following from private sources : &apos; Carranza, the President of New Mexico, has up to the present maintained towards the machinations of Wilson a firm, just and honest impartiality; he has held out with all his strength and courage against all the attempts at intimidation of the Yankees. This spirit is also shown by the new stipulations which his Government issued recently in connection with the &quot;black list,&quot; in order to throw up an effective dam against the political agitations of the American consular representatives for the exclusion of German trade, ddie Mexican Government states emphatically in these stipulations that the attitude of the Americans, if they were to be given a free hand, would not only mean a violation of Mexican neutrality, but would also be an encroachment upon the sovereignty of the Mexican Government in its own country. Therefore, according to a law of May 8th, the captains of all ships which call at Mexican ports will be obliged to deliver all goods destined for consignees who are on the North American &quot; black list &quot; to those consignees, even though they might be forbidden to do so by the North American consular representatives. In the stipulations it is stated that every captain will have to pay a fine in money of 50 pesos for every undelivered kollo, and that his departure from Mexico would be prohibited.&apos; &quot;Mexico and United States. Mining Companies. A Washington Press message (May 27th) states that the Mexican Government has notified the American mining companies operating in Mexico of its intention to double the amount of bullion they are required to reimport against the ore exported. Under the present arrangement, which the United States approved, 25 per cent, of the value of the gold and silver in ores shipped must be returned to Mexico.
NETHERLANDS.Dutch-German Economic Negotiations. According to.an official statement in the Dutch Press of May 25th, the discussions between the Netherlands and German negotiators upon outstanding questions concerning the carrying out of the former arrangements resulted on May 23rd in a full agreement being reached. On May 24th, therefore, negotiations were commenced about a new economic arrange-ment, and these are now being continued with the greatest possible dispatch.Limburg Railway.- Sir W. Townley reports that the Germans are demanding that Belgian railway trucks should be allowed to pass over the Limburg Railway. They also claim that the Customs examination should be made at the German, frontier, and further wish to substitute German guarantees for Dutch&apos; Consular certificates showing (hat goods exported from Belgium have not been requi-sitionech The Netherlands Government states that it cannot justifiably prevent the transit of ores from Germany to Belgium, particularly to the works at Hoboken. It is reported that the first German train to pass over the Limburg Railway into Belgium arrived in Holland on May 20th, and that six goods trains of about 60 trucks, and two passenger trains, will travel daily in both directions. The Nieuwe Courant, however, states that traffic will begin on June 4th, and that 25 trains will run in both directions daily. The trains will he served, by a Dutch staff across Dutch territory.Reported Resumption of Sand and Gravel Transit.- The Telegraaf (May 27th) learns that the transit of sand and gravel from Germany to Belgium was resumed on May 25th and that the first ship has passed Lobith en route for Ghent.Germany and Dutch Shipping. Press telegrams from Amsterdam announce that the Germans have taken into Swinemunde five Dutch ships on. the ground that that they carried no safe-conducts, the issue of these having being stopped by the German Admiralty during the negotiations proceeding between the Netherlands and German Governments. Sir W. Townley reports that in consequence of difficulties between the Netherlands and German Governments regarding the shipping question, orders have been issued that no Dutch vessels other than sailing and coast fishing Aressels shall put to sea. According to a Washingtoif Press telegram, the United States Government has notified the Netherlands Government that the balance of grain promised hy President Wilson can only be carried in ships sent from Holland, and that the request of the Netherlands Government that it should be transported by the three ships now in American ports cannot be granted (and see under &quot; General &quot;).Hire of Dutch rccjulsitioned Ships. His Majesty&apos;s Government is willing to allow the Dutch shipowners as good terms for their requisitioned ships as they Avould have secured by a A&quot;oluntary arrangement. But the latter are not entitled to expect quite such favourable conditions as those obtained by the Swedish shipoAvners under the modus vlvencli (owing to the provisional character of that arrangement) ; the sterling and dollar exchanges must be as far as possible safeguarded ; and no concession must be made that might endanger the negotiations with the Norwegian shipowners. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir W. Townley to invite the Netherlands Government to send a representative to London to discuss the matter with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States representatives.Cargoes of requisitioned Dutch Ships. Lord Reading enquires the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the sale of cargoes from requisitioned Dutch ships, in the case of goods not of military importance, nor subject to deterioration, the interest in which has passed to the consignee and which are marketable in Holland.Allies and Dutch Food Supply. The Foreign Office instructs Sir W. Townley to point out to the Netherlands Government that, Avhile the. Allies are prepared to establish a scheme of rations for Dutch import, such a scheme can only be considered in connection Avith a general agreement Avhich must include guarantees for the stoppage or restriction of Dutch exports to the enemy.Restrictions on Exports from Dutch East Indies. In reply to a protest by His Majesty&apos;s Government against the embargo placed upon exports from the Dutch East
Indies (see Reports Nos. 67 and 69), the Netherlands Government has replied that this measure was not adopted with any provocative intention, but merely to ensure the importation of certain commodities indispensable for the supply of the Colonies.   The Governor-General has been instructed to avoid all possible delay injurious to foreign&apos; interests.Proposed Convoy to Dutch fUasb Indies.- -The Foreign Office learns that the Nether-, lands Government proposes shortly to send a convoy to the Dutch East Indies. His Majesty&apos;s Government is considering the questions raised by this proposal.NORWAY.Norirrgian-American Agreement. A somewhat fuller conspectus of the Norwegian-American Agreement (see Report No. 68) is communicated as follows :--(1) Provision for Norumifs Needs. The United States Government undertakes to facilitate the export to Norway of food and roth;oistuff, oils, textile materials, metals and other commodities required by Norway up to specified annual .quantities, subject to the domestic needs of the United States of America and. to those of the Allies. In order to save tonnage special inducement is given to Norway to obtain her requirements in Russia.(2) Restriction of Enemy Supplies. In consideration of the foregoing, a strict control is exercised over exports, and the Norwegian Government agrees to prohibit absolutely the export to the enemy of all. foodstuffs except fish, (limited to 48,000 tons per annum), and of metals and chemicals, except limited quantities of specified materials.(3) Provision for Allied, Requirements.-As compensation, for the allotment of NorwayN requirements, the Norwegian Government will permit the free export to the Allies of commodities required by them, and. consisting of (a) chemical and (b) metallurgical products, (c) minerals, (d) wood, and the manufactures of wood, (e) fish, and fish products in annual quantities, which are estimated and set out in the Agreement.(4) Safeguards. The Norwegian-American Agreement does not contain any explicit provision for the control of the exports of Norwegian native products to neutral countries contiguous to Germany, but it .is considered that indirect export to the enemy of native products will be prevented by the clause giving to the Allies the option to purchase Norwegian surplus output;; such export would moreover be a breach, of the spirit of the Agreement, entitling the Allies to demand suitable guarantees.The terms of this Agreement do not modify the old branch agreements with the Norwegian Trading Associations, and the Allies are prepared to revive these agreements in their old form, subject to a readjustment of the rations to conform with the terms of the American-Norwegian. Agreement. Sir iVI. Findlay reports that the Agreement was published, simultaneously at Christ jania and Washington on May 27th.German Submarine Attacks on Fishing Vessels. On May 23rd the Norwegian Foreign. Minister, questioned in the Storthing as to the sinking of Norwegian &quot;fishing-vessels by German submarines in the Arctic Ocean, stated that he had mentioned the matter to the German Minister, who had replied that the danger zone still existed in the Arctic. When informed that lifeboats had been fired upon, the German Minister answered that he had. no information about that,, but promised, to telegraph to Berlin requesting that this should not be repeated, lie also asked for copies of the Government reports on the matter.SPAIN.German Submarines. The reported attempt of U.B. 48 to escape from Ferrol has been denied by the Spanish Foreign Minister (though it is known she   was   testing  her   engines).

German Wireless of May 25th. reports: &quot;In connection with the series of lectures about modern Spain, which, are being held at tlie Bonn University from. May 27th to June 7th, and which are public and free to everybody, the Koelhische Zeitung remarks that to Bonn has been allotted the work of foreign and Roman cultural, circles, chiefly those of Spain, France, Italy, and Spanish. America. The series of lectures about Spain has been prepared with, great care and caution in such a manner that no domain of the Spanish national existence remains untouched, ami this scries of lectures will lie especially sympathetic, because Spain has not allowed herself to be drawn into the war against Germany&quot; (and see Report No. 60).SWEDEN.Sioedish-Allied Tonnage Agreement.-kn. Agreement allowing for the allocation of Swedish, tonnage to the Allies was signed on. May 29th by the Swedish, British and United States negotiators, and now awaits ratification.&apos; hy tlie Swedish Government. The United States War Trade Board, on the recommendation of His Majesty&apos;s Government, accepted the lowered limit ol: 400,000 tons of Swedish shipping as the amount charterable. ;Argentine Republic and Swedish Tonnage. Sir E. Howard reports that the Argentine Minister in Stockholm recently approached the Swedish Government with, a view to the charter of Swedish .tonnage in return for raw materials. The Swedish. Government having brought, this request to the notice of-Sir E. Howard, he indicated to the Argentine Minister the undesirability of interposing it pending the conclusion of an agreement between Sweden and the Allies. The Swedish Foreign Minister intimated that should the Allied Governments, after such, agreement had been arrived at, come to an arrangement for cession to the Argentine Government of part of the Swedish tonnage chartered, to them, the Swedish Government would have no objection, to negotiating with the Argentine Government accordingly.Transit Goods in Sweden-Sir E. Howard reports that transit goods in Sweden (see Reports Nos. 66 and 69; also No. 68 under &quot;Norway&quot;), although, under control of the A.B. Transito, are being made the subject of speculation by undesirable persons, and submits for approval measures proposed by the Swedish Food Corn-mission (subject to the consent of the Swedish Government) and endorsed by the Allied Ministers and the Local. Inter-allied Trade Committee. A special clause is included relating to goods destined for Finland.Export of Tar to Denmark. According to Social Demohrnlen an agreement has been readied between the Swedish, and Danish Governments for I he export of 5,000,000 crowns worth of tar from Sweden to Denmark.SWITZERLAND.German-Swiss Economic Agreement. Sir H. Rumbold reports that according to an official communiquo dated May 21st, the Federal Council on May 20th authorised its representatives to sign an economic agreement with Germany (see Report No. 69). As stipulated by the French Prime Minister in his conversations with, the Swiss representatives at Paris, the agreement will not contain any mention of the coal to be supplied by France. The issue is summarised in the following extract from the communique (as reported by the  Press): &quot;This, therefore, is the situation which
the Federal Council has now to face before deciding the questions involved : On the one hand, the French Government adheres to its offer of 85,000 tons of coal, per month without demanding compensation of any kind, but this offer would cease to hold good in the opinion of the French Government, which consequently would allow it to lapse, if the Federal Council admitted in principle that the control already existing for war material, properly so called, might be extended to other articles of export manufactured with the aid of German coal.   The French Government, with a view to preserving Swiss industries working for the Entente countries from the regrettable consequences of the restrictions on the use of coal demanded by Germany, declared, however, that in case Switzerland should accept the idea of this control it would deliver the amount of coal necessary to manufacture articles intended for the Entente countries. On the other hand, the German Government was ready to renounce any further extension of her control over coal, but made her renunciation of such control depend upon the condition that Switzerland should actually import from the Entente countries quantities of coul which, in. fact, would not be much less than 85,000 tons per month. If this quantity, however, were not actually imported, the German Government demanded that control should be applied, in principle, but it was understood that this control should be limited to ascertaining whether the articles had or had not been manufactured with German coal.   The articles in question which had not been manufactured with German coal could then leave Switzerland without hindrance of any kind.   This control was to be put into force only after July 15th.   The Federal Council could only settle its difficulties in a manner useful to and in conformity -with the economic necessities of Switzerland, by seeking a solution compatible with the statements it had received.   Moreover, the interests of Switzerland as regards supplies of coal, iron, and other commodities would not allow her to refuse to come to an agreement with Germany, an agreement which had been exhaustively discussed during several weeks, the text of which had been already drawn up. and   needed nothing but the signatures of  the negotiators.   The situation, un-regulated by an agreement, was dangerous to the economic security of the country. Further, the  control regarding the use of  German coal   found   its   analogy  iu other controls that Switzerland had already established at the request   of   one or the other of the two belligerent parties.    There was now no danger to Swiss industry, thanks  to the declaration   by  which France placed  at Sw.itzerland&apos;s disposal the coal necessary for the manufacture of articles under control supervision and destined for the Entente countries.   Finally, the Federal Council, wishes to point out expressly that this control was not a foreign one at all, but a Swiss control, carried out by Swiss agents responsible solely to the Federal Council.   In its sitting of May 21st, the Federal Council, therefore, authorised the negotiators to sign the Germano-Swiss Economic Convention,   This convention contains no clause relative to tin; delivery of coal by countries at war with Germany.   On May 16th the German Government had already informed the Federal Council that, despite the postponement in the signing of the convention, it would create no difficulty for Switzerland, and would continue the delivery of coal.   Thanks to this friendly attitude, it has been possible thoroughly to re-examine all. the points now in question and to proceed with the signing of the convention after having cleared up all the misunderstandings which may have arisen on either side.&quot;German Wireless of May 22nd quotes the Berncr Tagblalt as attacking the &quot; biassed reporting &quot; of the Swiss-French Press upon the negotiations. German Wireless of May 23rd, 24th and 27th, quoting the German Press, denounces the French Government as having threatened the economic independence of Switzerland.Proposed Accpvisition by Switzerland of Enemy Tonnage in Spain. -With reference to the expressed wish of the Swiss Government to acquire enemy ships in Spain (see Reports Nos. 64 and 69), or to obtain Allied approval for their transference to the Spanish Government for the purpose of carrying foodstuffs from Spain to Cette, the Foreign Office instructs Sir A. Plarclinge that Plis Majesty&apos;s Government has no objection to either procedure, provided the vessels are used solely in the interests of Switzerland (under specified conditions) or the Allies.Maximalist Mission to Switzerland. Sir PI. Rumbold reports the arrival in Switzerland of a Maximalist Diplomatic Mission under a Lett named Berzine. The President, while not recognising the de facto Government in. Russia, is prepared to discuss with the Mission questions regarding Swiss residents and interests in Russia.56S1-si F

Rumbold, on behalf of the Swiss Director of Public Economy, enquires whether, in view of the time taken in transport, facilities for imports of Swiss silks, &amp;e., may be extended beyond June 30th.German Manipulation of Allied Exchange. Sir Id. Rumbold reports that the Germans have recently contributed to a fall in British and French exchanges by offering large amounts of sovereigns and francs for which there were.no buyers. He submits that special arrangements should be made-as by the Germans to watch and safeguard exchange in all neutral countries.URUGUAY.The British, Mission in South America. A. Montevideo message of May 23rd states that Sir Maurice de Bun sen and the other members of the British Special Mission arrived there on- that date. A further message of May 28th announces the departure of the Mission for Buenos Aires.VATICAN.Visit of Prince of Wales to the Pope. Count de Salis reports that on May 28th the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Pope, by -whom he^was received wdth ceremony, ddie Prince also exchanged, visits with die Cardinal Secretary of State, and received various officials of the Papal Court. ddie visit of the Prince has given great satisfaction to the Vatican.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. ddiese are mostly in abeyance during the renewed German offensive. Further arguments, arising out of the Brest Treaty, continue between the Bolshevist Government of Russia and the Germans, covering practically all the provisions of the treaty which the Bolshevists were compelled to sign on March 3rd. Finland, and all States which have, or are said to have, broken away from Russia, are affected ; also the remnants of the Black Sea Fleet, ddie Brest Treaty&apos; has apparently not yet been ratified by Austria-Hungary.Von Kuhlmann&apos;s views on the Bucharest Treaty, given under Rumania, are of interest, read in conjunction wdth the report of King Ferdinancks attitude given under Bulgaria.aRussia. Russian Wireless of May 25th published the text of a Note, transmitted on the 22nd to Count Mirbach, proposing a meeting at Moscow for the determination of points arising out of the Brest Treaty and still remaining obscure. Precedence is proposed for the following questions : (1) ddie situation in the Caucasus. ff  (2) ddie situation in the Crimea.(3) The demarkation of the frontier provided, for in the third Article of the Brest Treaty. This demarkation was interrupted at Pskoff, where the Russian Commission completely disagreed with the German views.(4) The political situation in Esthonia and Livonia, which countries, as agreed to in the proposed Treaty, are only temporarily in the occupation of the German authori Lies and policed by the Germans.(5) Obscurities in arrangements about Avar prisoners, which haA7e led to many misunderstandings.(6) Fundamental principles affecting the economic relations between Russia and Germany.
M. Chieherin pressed for Moscow as tire place of meeting, because all documents are available there. On May 28th he asked M. Joffe at Berlin when the German delegates might be expected to arrive. On May 29th he added that Count Mirbach had told him that the Commission, &quot;must meet at Berlin,&quot; and. asked M. -Joffe again, to press for Moscow.On May 26th M. Chicherin published by Wireless the acceptance by the Russian Government of the proposal, put forward by Count Mirbach as a basis for peace between Russia and Finland. In this arrangement Finland is to cede Ino and Raivola, and to obtain a strip of the Murman region, with a port on the sea-coast. The Russians are to undertake not to fortify Ino and Raivola. [Until Germany insisted on making peace with Finland, it was not understood that she was at Avar with that country. The present German assumption seems to be that Finland is at war with Russia.]German AVireless of May 25th reported that the first detachment of the Russian peace delegation had arrived at Kieff. Russian AVireless of May 26th reported that the negotiations with the Ukraine at Kieff were expected to begin on. the 25th, after a formal sitting on the 23rd. Another Russian Wireless message of the same date reported that, at the sessions of May 23rd and 24th at Kieff, the Ukraine delegates showed inadmissible tendencies to delay the negotiations by ungrounded pretexts aud. by senseless demands. These were calculated (.1) to make the Russians acknowledge that there has been a state of war between them and. the Ukraine, which the Russians deny, and (2) to make the Russians renounce certain territory belonging to Russia. On May 25th Mr. Wardrop forwarded a Moscow Press report that German delegates were present at the Kieff Conference. On May 28th M. Chicherin protested by Wireless to Berlin against a &quot;hateful agitation &quot;being carried on in the Kieff Press against the Russian Delegation, and appealed to the German Government to take all measures necessary to guard the dignity and safety of the members. On May 29th Russian AVireless announced details of the points raised by Ukrainian delegates calculated to obstruct the conclusion of peace.Russian AVireless of May 27th makes the following&apos; important announcement ou the naval situation in the Black Sea, as affecting peace negotiations in Caucasia and. Trans-Caucasia: &quot;A detachment of warships of our Black Sea Fleet left for Novorossisk just before the capture of Sebastopol and some ships by the Germans. This capture was carried out by the Germans in. spite of all obligations and all. treaties. The German flag has been hoisted on the coast aud on all ships which remained at Sebastopol. The meaning of such action is that Germany regards all of them as her property. The request of Germany for the return of all shipb to Sebastopol was evidently made with a view to treating them in the same way as those ships which remained at Sebastopol. Such action is contrary not only to all clauses concerning naval questions of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty, but also to the first clause, which was that Russia and Germany have decided, to live in the future in friendship and harmony.&quot; On May 28th M. Chicherin announced by wireless that the Russian Government had made it a condition for the return of tire Fleet to Sebastopol that Sebastopol should not remain in German occupation. A portion of this message, referring to von Kuhlmanips reply, has been mutilated, in transmission.   (Serial 4845.)Reliable information, dated May .19th, has reached the Foreign Office from Teheran (May 21st) that delegates from Germany and Turkey had reached Batoum for negotiation Avith the Caucasian Government aloont peace. Bulgarian and Austrian delegates had not arrived. The impression was that, since the Central Powers had seized the Russian Black Sea Avar vessels, they would be in a position to dictate their own terms.Air. Lockhart on May 24th (received 27th) reported that a Peace Conference would soon take place at Vladikavkas between the Trans-Caucasian and Russian Govern-ments, and that good results were not to be expected. This report of an approaching Conference Avas confirmed by Chicherin in Russian Wireless of May 25th, when lie pointed out that Vladikavkas (vladivostock-Caucasris) was a better meeting place than Kieff, which has no good communications with Tiflis or with Moscow. The Russian GoArernment wishes it to be understood that this action on their part does not signify that the so-called &quot;Trans-Caucasian Government &quot; or the independence of the country has been recognised, for this independence was contrary to the wishes of the majority of the popirlation of Trans-Caucasia.Finland. (See under Russia.)
Poland. (Errata.) The paragraph on Poland on page 1.8 of Western Report No. 07 (May 8th) was based on a misunderstanding, and should be erased. Informa-tion in possession of the Foreign Office leaves in doubt the question whether reports of a Treaty between Germany and Russia about Poland are genuine.Ukraine. The Times of May 30th publishes &quot;amazing&quot; figures of the prepara-tions of the Central Powers to send spirituous liquor into the Ukraine in connection with the Treaty.   (See cdso under Russia.)Caucasia, &amp;.c, (See under Russia.)Rumania. In a recent speech to the Chamber of Commerce, von Kuhlmann, according to German Wireless of May 23rd, stated that the aim. of German policy-is to hand over the Northern -Dobrudja to Bulgaria as soon as possible, and &quot; this will be done after the agreement between Turkey and Bulgaria has been concluded, probably very soon.&quot;1 In the same speech von , Kuhlmann confessed that, in the &quot; peace &quot; conditions imposed upon Rumania, &quot; considerable economic advantages were demanded, which make up for a war indemnity in cash.&quot; [The &quot;no indemnities&quot; formula is hereby jettisoned by Germany, as &quot;no annexations&quot; lias been by Austria-Hungary.] German Wireless of May 26th replies to the combined protests of the Allied Ministers at Jassy, using the following words : &quot; Because the Entente was not able to fulfil its promises, and Rumania was left in the lurch, the present Rumanian Government has concluded peace. The protests of the Entente cannot alter at all the fate of Rumania.&quot;Germany. On May 25th Sir E. Howard furnished proofs that the German Government had prevented the London Memorandum upon Labour war aims and peace terms from reaching the working classes in Germany. Mr. Branting, who tried to get the information into Germany, thinks that working men of all countries ought to be informed of the action of the German Government in preventing information about the opinions of the -working men of Western Europe from reaching working men in Germ an j.German Wireless of May 26th published a long manifesto from the &quot; Inter-Barliamentary Union, German Parliamentary group,&quot; endeavouring to find points of agreement between themselves and the &quot; British group &quot; on the subject of war aims, which are dealt with in some detail,Plerr Dernburg, in a long article published in the A&apos;ienna Neue Vreie Presse, writes : &quot; The peace in the East will not be aide to afford us fully equivalent compensation for the trade with three-quarters of the world and the failure of these (non-ferrous metal) resources of raw materials.&quot;   (The Times, May 29th).Austria-Hungary, According to a Moscow Press report, sent by Mr. Wardrop on May 18th (received 24th), Austria-Hungary is said, to have declared her readiness to exchange ratifications of the Brest Treaty-at Berlin.Bulgaria. Information dated May 14th has reached the Foreign Office from a reliable source (89649) to the effect that King Ferdinand of Bulgaria is much dissatided with the Bucharest Treaty, but the Central Bowers would not give in to him.Great Britain. The Ministry of Labour, in a report for the week ending May 22nd, stated that the continued lull on the Western front up to that date had induced an almost complete silence in the Labour papers on military affairs, but argument continued, about the power of an International Socialist Conference to end. hostilities earlier than they will be ended by fighting, and to secure a democratic and a lasting-peace.The Home Secretary reported (May 23rd) that the tone of the working class throughout the country is still sound upon the war. Pacifists in all parts are driven to underhand activities, which are conducted without regard to common honesty.1 According to information received from Sir E. Howard (May 28th), such an agreement appears to have been reached, provided that the Central Powers agree to certain conditions, including- the cession of the Northern Dobrudja and parts of Macedonia and Serbia to Bulgaria, in return for territorial -concessions to Turkey.
