FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Beage Discussions.In tlie present emergency, tlie saying attributed to Ludeiidorff : &quot;One does not &quot; fight battles to defeat tlie opposing army, but to stimulate the desire for peace &quot; behind the opposing army,&quot; seems worth attention. An intense defeatist campaign has since been launched by Germany in hostile and neutral countries in the hope of affecting the issue. In Morocco Eaisuli is credited with the following appreciation of such propaganda : &quot; The only way to be sure of a German victory is an ackriowledg-nieiii of defeat by Gerjuauy&apos;s adversaries.&quot;Under Ukraine is given an interesting report of the German policy of expanding their economic development by the simple process of expanding the frontiers of the Ukraine. Reports of the German policy towards her allies are given under Germany. Comments on Count Czorniids speech at Vienna are given under Ausjria-Bangary. He broke off the negotiations, left Bucharest in company with von Kuhlniann, and went to Vienna to deliver the speech when, the Kaiser-Battle had not gone as well as had been expected. He returfied to Bucharest on April 9th, and von Rilhhnanu is said to be going there in a few days.

PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Vladivosbock. The Foreign Office learns that oh the morning of April 4.th, three Japanese office employees were shot by an armed band of robbers. In view of the impotence of the police, the Japanese Admiral (Kato) landed two companies on April 5th, informing the local authorities of his intention to protect the lives and property of Japanese subjects. A party of 50 men was subsequently landed from H.M.S. Suffolk. No action was taken by the United States warship. There has been some excitement amongst the populace, but no outbreak has occurred. The Bolshevist Government has protested, and has requested the immediate withdrawal of the landing parties. The Bolshevist official organ and Wireless Bress describe the incident as an &quot; attack on Russia &quot; by Japan, and ask&quot; whether England is going hand in hand with &quot; Japan in the destruction of Russia. . . . On the answer will depend the foreign&apos; &quot; policy of the Soviet in the immediate future. Meanwhile the Soviet Republic orders &quot; the Siberian Soviets to resist all violent irruption into Russia.&quot; It is added that &quot;the bourgeoisie of Siberia is stretching out its hands to foreign usurpers. The &quot; Municipal Council of Vladivostock, composed of Mensheviks and Revolutionary &quot; Socialists of the Right, has passed a resolution welcoming the armed intervention of &quot; Japan, with intention of strangling the Russian Revolution and taking authority &quot; from the workmen and peasants.&quot; The Foreign Office has instructed Mr. Lockhart that the British force has been landed solely for the protection of British lives and propertj&apos;, that the affair is purely local, and that an amicable settlement is expected. Discussions are proceeding between the Allied Representatives and the Bolshevist Government.Proposed Allied Labour Mission to United States. The Foreign Office informs Lord Reading that tire British, and Belgian delegates on the proposed Labour Mission to the United States (see Report, No. 60) have been refused permission to sail, either to America or France, by the Sailors&apos; and. Firemen s Union.Allied Financial Blockade. A Memorandum (E.O.C. 75), dated April 3rd, deals with the question of extending Allied control in the direction, of preventing enemy financial operations through neutral banks.FRANCE.Chamber adopts Budget. According to the Petit Paris &quot;ten (April 5th), the Chamber of Deputies has adopted the Budget in its entirety by 475 votes. M. Elotz, Minister of Finance, said that the credits voted amounted to Fr. 8,378,478,483, which included charges on national loans, the floating debt, and increases in the salaries of officials.Bolo. Lord Bertie reports that the President of the French Republic has declined to exercise the right of pardon in the case of Bolo. A respite has, however, been granted, in view of the condemned man&apos;s readiness to make certain revelations.BELGIUM.German economic designs upon Belgium. The Cologne Gazette (quoted in the Times of March 11th and April 9th) is giving an inspired sketch of the economic conditions which Germany would be disposed to dictate in the event of the nominal restoration of that country.   The first article, dealing with direct trade between Germany and
ITALY.Italy and the Austrian Subject Races; A Press report announces the opening on April 8th of a Conference at Rome between delegates of Italy and of the subject races of Austria. Delegates from England, France and Italy also attended. Ine Senator Ruffini was elected President, and the following were chosen as Yice-Presidents :  Signor Andrea Torre for Italy ; M. Benes for the Czecho-Slovaks; At. Draghicesco for the Rumanians; Dr. Trumbitch for the Jugo-Slavs ; M. Zamorski for the Boles ; M. Franklin -Bouillon for France ; Mr. Wickhara Steed for England; and Mr, Nelson Gay for America. The Parliamentary National Defence Group (consisting of 125 Senators and 160 Deputies) and the Italian Irredentist Political Association have signified their adhesion to the aims of the Conference, as also have numerous other Committees and Associations. The most important political adhesion is that of Signor Bissolati. Commenting on the opening of the Conference the Intransigeant remarks :  &quot; To parry the Germanic thrust along the two great historic routes to constantinople and the Caucasus towards Asia Minor, India, and Egypt it is &quot; necessary to erect two living ramparts a Great Serbia, leaning on Italy andRumania and barring the road to Constantinople ; and, between the Baltic and the &quot; Carpathians, a Great Poland, leaning on an independent Bohemia. The task is &quot; enormous, but everything at this moment is enormous, and. there is only one way to &quot; avoid being caught napping that is, to see big.&quot;   (And see Reports Nos. 57 and 61.)Enemy Trading. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that the disclosures of Signor Birolini in the Italian Chamber regarding the illicit traffic in cotton, and silk between Italy and. the Central Empires through Switzerland (see Report No. 59) have led to vigorous action by the Italian Government. Many of the persons implicated have been arrested. Stocks of cotton worth 100,000,000 lire have been seized at Genoa, and stocks of silk worth 22,000,000 lire at Milan.Heavy Buying of Bank Shares.  Sole (March 13th) reports : &quot; The shares of the &quot; Bauca Commerciale Italiana are being eagerly bought on the Italian Stock &quot; Exchanges, and it is thought that the buying is for the purpose of obtaining control. &quot; of the Bank.   The shares have reached the highest price since the boom of 1.906.&quot;ALBANIA.Austrian Designs: The Foreign Office learns of an Austrian, scheme, apparently approved by ex-King Constantino, for. dividing Albania into two portions; the Southern up to Valona to be given to Greece, and the Northern to be offered to Serbia by way of compensation for territory taken by Bulgaria.Belgium, advocates the saturation of -Belgian trade and industry with German -capital and influence. The second emphasises the indispensability of Antwerp for German world-trade. Mere commercial and shipping treaties will not suffice for this purpose, but real economic guarantees will be necessary, affecting (inter alia) inland waterway traffic, railway traffic, the port of Antwerp itself, and special customs facilities.Germans and Flemish, Activist Movement. The Telegraaf (April 5th) understands that, owing to their opposition to the Flemish Activist agitation, the German Military Commander at Ghent has relieved Burgomaster Braun and Alderman de Weert of their functions, and that they will be replaced by German officials. The Nieuwc Botierdamsehe Commit (April 5th) states that, as a result of the strike in the Belgian Law Courts as a protest against the arrest of Belgian judges in connection with the Activist disturbance in Flanders, the German Governor-General. has issued a proclamation announcing his decision to establish German courts of law to maintain public order and safety. Until these new courts are in operation, however, the punishment of all crimes and offences is to be entrusted to the German military commanders.   (And see Reports Nos. 52-54 and 59.)(And see under &quot; Netherlands.&quot;)
ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Revolutionary Forces in Austria. The Political Intelligence Department points--out that with the exception of. the German Nationalists, who constitute merely one-fifth of the Reichsrat, every single party has repeatedly refused to share the-responsibility for governing Austria. The doctrine of complete national self-determination supplies a link, not only for opposition, but also for action, between the non-German nationalities and the Austrian-German Socialists ; and the radical programme of agrarian reforms put forward by the former constitutes a further bond of sympathy. The growth of Bolshevism is discernible in the open declarations of the Arbeiter Zeitung, and of old moderate leaders such as Wilhelm Ellenbogen, and also-in the growing disorganisation of the Army. The increasing antagonism of the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs is shown by their refusal to discuss terms with the Premier-except upon the basis of their programmes of March 30th, 1917, which presuppose the disruption of both Austria and Hungary and the reunion of all Czecho-Slovak and all Jugo-Slav territories. The Magyar movement for a separate Hungarian Army is. also significant. Whatever divergences may appear at a later stage, irredentist Nationalism, extreme Socialism among the industrial working classes and the agrarian movement stimulated by the example of Russia and the Ukraine are all at present working in the same direction. There are only two dominant forces left in Eastern Europe, German militarism and social revolution, and round these all the others must group themselves. A German check in the West, followed by any further aggravation of the Austrian difficulties with Bolshevism in the Ukraine, might well precipitate a revolution.Question of Bolshevist Representative at Vienna. Russian Wireless announces, the designation of Lew Kameueff, member of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Delegation, as Plenipotentiary Representative of the Russian Government to Vienna. In reply the Austrian Foreign Office points out that in accordance with Article 10 of the Peace Treaty, diplomatic relations are only to be resumed after ratification of the Treaty,, and only then will thev moment have arrived for the selection of mutual representatives,, after previous agreement.   (And see under &quot; German Internal Affairs.&quot;)Food Supply. The Neue Freie Presse of March I2th reports a speech by Dr. Paul, the new President of the Food Bureau, in the course of which he stated that there were no provisions ; that it was a case of living from hand to mouth ; and that until the next harvest there could be no material change. . . . He uttered a warning against the hope of supplies from the Ukraine, at all events to any large extent. The Lu:ow Gazeta Wieczorna reports that flour is actually being sent from Austria to-provision the Austrian forces in the Ukraine. (According to a telegram from Berne, the grain stocks in the Ukraine have been announced by von AValdow to be barely sufficient to feed the German army of occupation). The following statement regarding supplies from the Ukraine and Rumania was recently made by Count Czernin : &quot;You know that the Ukraine has promised us to deliver its entire surplus of agricultural products, ddie Commission which was appointed to oiganise the exchange of commodities with the Ukraine has already met at Kiev and is now busily at work. As soon as the negotiations with the Ukrainian Government on this point are finished and 1 hope this will, speedily be the case imports from the Ukraine can. begin on a considerable scale. We have agreed with the Ukrainian. Government that tho epiantities of grain which, according to the Peace Treaty, are to be delivered to the Quadruplice Powers, shalba mount to at least a million tons, and we hope that the organisation to be established will render it possible to collect these supplies and have them transported within the period fixed. At the moment supplies from the Ukraine are naturally only small, and according as the improvisation hitherto arranged has permitted. Up to the present it is true that only 30 wagons of grain, peas, and beans have reached Austria from the Ukraine. Further consignments are en route. Six hundred wagons of various kinds of foodstuffs are ready in the Ukraine to be transported into the interior of Austria-Hungary, and these consignments will be continued until the imports are properly organised and can begin regularly on a larger scale. Larger imports will now be made possible by the peace with Rumania, -which will permit transport from Odessa to the Danube ports. We thus hope to be able to carry out in course of time large and regular further consignments from the Ukraine, for the largest part of this route, and to a smaller-
extent-, by rail. It should not, however, be forgotten that, our numerous troops, now in. the Ukraine, draw supplies from that country itself, a circumstance which is naturally advantageous to our country. While I admit that the imports from the Ukraine are still, small, and. must be increased, nevertheless, the logical conclusion is that our general, good situation would have been considerably worse had this agreement not been concluded. This doubly proves the necessity for peace with the Ukraine. From Rumania herself we. obtain over 70,000 tons of maize from the past yeaPs harvest. Tile forthcoming harvest in Rumania, the surplus of which will be equally divided between us and Germany, should bring the Monarchy a supply of, roundly, 400,000 tons of grain, peas, and beans (Iliilsenfriichten) and fodder, which will likewise have to be transported by the Danube route. Moreover, Rumania gives us a supply of 300,000 sheep, 100,000 pigs, to be provided immediately, which will produce a slight improvement in our present meat supply. It is, therefore, clear from the foregoing particulars that everything has been and will continue to be done to obtain by exploitation of the regions, which the peace treaties have opened up to us in the Fast, whatever is obtainable. The difficulties connected with the procuring of these supplies from the Ukraine are, of course, still considerable, as the Ukraine is not yet consolidated. The State has only just concluded three years of war, and no real State order exists there. Assuming the goodwill of the Ukrainian Government, which we do not doubt, to fulfil its treaty obligations, we shall, with the help of our own organisation, succeed in overcoming these difficulties. In this connection, 1 may here remark, that an immediate general, peace, or such a peace within a measurable period of time, would not give us any other advantages than those which I have sketched.&quot;.(And sec Daily Review, Food Supplement, of April Nth.)Industrial Situation. The &quot;Economists&apos;&quot; column in the Neve Freie Presse (March 3rd) contains the following: &quot; A general longing for peace pervades industry, there is probably no single branch, indeed hardly any undertaking, which does not desire a quick end to the war. Fat profits are a thing of the past,; the market reached its highest point in 11)16, began to sink in the early months of 1917, and now approaches collapse. Difficulties of production and burdens which constantly diminish profits accumulate with tlie long duration of the war. Very few industries are now running to their fullest capacity. The lack of raw material and half manufactured articles makes itself very much felt; the provision of the necessary quantities of coal, coke, iron, textile materials becomes more and moredifficu.lt; the nourishment, of the workers causes the greatest anxiety; the railways do not run normally, afhd stoppages of traffic become more frequent and longer. Military orders have diminished in the last six months, as operations, with the exception of the Italian offensive, reach only a fraction of their former extent. Munition depots are richly provided with, many stores, sometimes overstocked, and thus numerous munition factories have for weeks diminished their output, and in. some cases shut down entirely, while other centres of production have for want of material been obliged to restrict themselves to the absolutely indispensable. .Prices are very high, have risen rapidly during 1917, the Government have been obliged to agree to increases, but costs of production and new burdens have risen still more rapidly. Profits in many concerns are diminishing, and in some cases have already sunk below the pre-war mark&quot;. Some concerns are indeed running without any profit, the diminished production corresponding to less than half their capacity. Dividends for 1917 are still high, for the works had been able to fill up reserves, but especially in the heavy industries reductions are inevitable, and in 191S a further decrease is expected. There are numerous complaints of the unequal distribution of raw materials ; the shortage in iron and coal Avon Id not be so marked if Government works did not without any apparent justification secure themselves for mouths ahead, while prhtite industries have not enough to keep -running. The undertakings which are in the interest of the general public and the State must be provided, especially the loco-motive and Avagon factories. The rolling-stock of the railways is much deteriorated, and urgently requires renewing; the shortage of wagons is especially noticeable in the coal trade, but also in other industries, and so the supply of raw materials and the consignment of manufactured articles is interfered Avith. The locomotive and wagon factories have, lunvever, also to suffer from the lack of coal, and iron, and are only able to fill their orders Incompletely and with great delays. In all industries the greatest stress is laid on the necessity of organising the supply.of food materials,51S1-2i n
winch, has been very inadequate in January and February. It is hoped that a Rumanian peace following on that with the Ukraine will relieve the very distressing si tuatipn.&quot;GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.The Western Offensive. The Political Information Department observes that German Socialism appears to be content with having entered a protest against the Eastern peace, the blame for which it is inclined to impute to the Bolshevists. As Harden puts it, &quot;If the Russians wdll stand it, why should German Labour protest,&quot; especially when the economic blockade appears to be broken. In the circumstances the German Socialists are prepared to give a trial to the &quot; German sword &quot; in the &quot;West : they only object to the screwing up of peace terms by the Pan-Germans and great industrialists to a pilch which will steel the resistance of the Allies, and defer peace indefinitely. The Frankfurter Zeitung of April 2nd severely criticises Iiindenburg&apos;s message to the Reichstag, in which he expressed the hope that it would now declare in favour of a &quot; strong German peace.&quot; The Foreign Office has received further information (see also Reports Nos. (Jl and G2) indicating that there is little elation in Germany over the Western offensive, and that, if the Allies continue to hold out, serious disturbances may be expected.Food Supply. Tire Foreign Office learns that, except in the Rhine towns and certain other large centres, the food situation in Germany has much improved since the spring of 1917. Prices, however, have risen to 350 per cent, above the normal. The improvement in the food conditions is largely clue to Government action. Formerly the farmers -were obliged to sell all their produce to the authorities at a price which left them little profit. This discouraged production. Now each farmer is obliged to supply a fixed quantity at a low rate ; the surplus of his stock he may sell for any price he can. get.Munitions Supply. The Foreign Office learns that the Germans have discovered substitutes for lead and nickel, and are replacing copper to a considerable extent by aluminium and iron. The supplies of petroleum from. Rumania are increasing, but mineral oils generally are still very short. The supply of mineral lubricants, however, has largely increased.Requisition of Clothing. The Lokalanzeiger announces that the Imperial Clothing Commission has decided that all persons in Germany who were subject to the special non-recurring property tax or armaments - tax of July 1918, shall now be required each to contrioute one sidt of worn clothing without payment to the Clothing Commission. These suits are to be used for the clothing of 750,000 Germans called up under the Auxiliary Service Act, and now employed, in the occupied territories. The armaments tax affected capital above 500Z. when the total earned, and unearned income exceeded 1U0L annually.Design to acquire Russian Shipping. The Foreign Office is informed of a German scheme for acquiring, through a Russian-Jewish Syndicate now in Sweden, a controlling interest in an important Russian Company possessing a quantity of shipping in Black Sea ports.Miltel-Europa. With reference to the German design for control of the mouth of the Danube (see Report No. 02), the Foreign Office learns that the Austro-Germans are endeavouring to impjose upon Rumania a transformation of the Danube Commission, irrespective of treaties and the rights of other Powers.Central European Air Traffic. A telegram from Munich announces the foundation in that city of an International Luft Aktien Gesellscha.fi by Lieutenant Paul Graetz of the Royal Saxon War Ministry, under the auspices of the Prince of Thurn and Taxis. The projector is negotiating with the Austrian authorities for the lengthening of the recently established Air Postal line Kiev-Vienna-Salzburg-Munich. He will then endeavour to link up Munich-V&apos;ienna-Berlin-Budapest-Bucharest-Solia-Constaiitinople, and to establish relations with neutral countries. A newspaper, the Luftpost L.A.A.G., is being published in connection with the scheme.Germany and Ukraine. German Wireless reports : &quot;German industry is making serious efforts to supply the Ukraine with articles which are necessary for her. According to the Rhemisch Weslfaelische Zeitung, which appears in the very heart of German industry, Germany is in a very good position to supply industrial goods to the Ukraine, which that country has been seriously lacking during the Avar.   The
Berliner Tagehlatb mentions among such goods agricultural machines, scythes, enamelled goods, and metal goods, &amp;c.&quot;Bolshevist A mhassado j &quot;-designate to Berlin. German Wireless of April 8th reports the appointment by the Bolshevist Government of m. Adolf Joffe as Ambassador to Berlin ; Russian Wireless of April 9th notifies the German Government of the appointment of M. Vladimir Zago^sky (at present interned in Germany) as First Secretary of the Russian Embassy in Berlin.  (And see under &quot; Enemy Allied Affairs.&quot;)Germany after the War. According to the Brunswick Neueste Nachrichlen, quoted by the Kolnische, Dr. von Michaelis, the ex-Chancellor, before taking up his new post as Governor of Pomerania, made a public speech at Benueckenstein in the Harz mountains, in the course of which lie said : &quot; We must look the fact in the &quot; face, that we shall take war distress with us into peace time. We must inwardly &quot; prepare ourselves to bear peace distress without murmuring. Scarcity and high &quot; prices wdll remain not only as regards food, but also in respect of clothes and &quot; shoes. Our great burden of debt will force us to the compulsory control of raw &quot; materials by the State. We must realise that we are also to blame for the war, not &quot; politically, for the Kaiser to the last moment wanted peace. This trial has been &quot; sent upon us because Mammon began to rule with us. God desired to preserve us &quot; from complete materialism. I would, rather renounce the War indemnity, &quot; if I were once more responsible for that, than by payment of its debts bring &quot; our people into the great danger of sinking into materialism. ddie simple &quot; domestic life will be our duty after the war. Cur children are our greatest &quot; possession. &quot;We must have children. We must not fear peace distress. The &quot; German people has ever shown itself most strong and splendid when it &quot; was in distress.&quot; ddie Foreign Office learns that, although the German -working classes are determined upon electoral reform in Prussia, there is, in the event of an early peace, little probability of any considerable democratic evolution. The Constitution is likely to remain unaltered, and, if there is closer co-operation between the Government and the Reichstag, there will, be nothing comparable to British Parliamentary government. There is not, in fact, any real desire in Germany for a real Parliament. For, in the first place, the German people is too much afraid of responsibility to wish for political power ; and in the second, such political power as it has is speedily neutralised by bureaucracy. Further, the older Socialists have been coining money during the war ; and those from the trenches will lie too much exhausted to trouble themselves about political changes, and, since no man will be demobilised until employment has been found for him, the motive of discontent will be wanting. Once the war is over, the political power will pass out of the hands of the military party into those of their friends, the magnates of the great industrial trusts.NETHERLANDS.Opinions on Allied Requisition of Dutch Tonnage.- Handelsblad sharply criticises, as insulting to the Allies, the reply of the Netherlands Government (see Report No. 02) on the subject of the requisition of Dutch tonnage in Allied ports, and declares that the Chamber should have been consulted before its publication. &quot;The &quot; Government has gone too far and the Dutch people cannot follow it: they will &quot; regard this declaration as a grievous wrong and a very unfriendly act.&quot; The paper further criticises the fact that the Government has twice uttered sharp protests against the Allies (i.e., re sand and gravel, and requisition), whilst the Chamber has yet to pronounce the first word of protest against German submarine atrocities. The Socialist ilet Voik complains that the cargoes of the Poeldyk and Maasdyk (sea Report No. 61) will only provide one-tenth of the first instalment of 100,000 tons. Never-theless, -satisfactory guarantees might be obtained. &quot; There is only one way to &quot; ensure that no grain reaches us from America, namely, to stop all negotiations. If &quot; the Netherlands Government choose that way, the3&apos;will assume towards that portion &quot; of the people who have no opportunity of stocking provisions a responsibility which &quot; we would not like to bear.&quot; ddie Nieuwe Rolterdamsehe Ccurant, alluding to a Renter report that the Poeldyk and Maasdyk were expected to carry tobacco to the United States, suggests that Holland should exploit this position. d&apos;he Nieuioe Courant publishes prominently a proposal that two ships of the Holland Lloyd, namely, the llollandia, 7,291 tons, lying at Buenos Aires, and the Kcnnemerland, 4,074 tons, lying at St. Vincent, should bring to Holland part of the 50,000 tons of grain reserved for Holland in South America,   ddie Courant says : &quot; We may even
&quot; presume that, if one of the reasons against the sending from Holland of two ships &quot; such as the Maasdyk and the Poeldyk to fetch grain from America is the doubt of &quot; our Government whether Germany would allow these ships to proceed unhindered, &quot; there can be no further reason for such doubt if two other&apos; vessels of greater tonnage &quot;reach Dutch ports.&quot; The journal points out further that, if the llollandia and Kennemerland are allowed to load, bunker, and proceed unhindered by the associated Governments, this would go far to provide an assurance with regard, to the intentions of those Governments which the Dutch Foreign Minister declared to be lacking at tlie moment. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office learns that the Dutch. Government contemplates re-opening negotiations for a general agreement.(And, on the general question, sec Daily Review (Neutral Press Supplement) of April 5th.)Cargoes of Requisitioned Vessels. The Foreign Office informs Sir W. Townley that with the exception of coal and pitch (which will be replaced whenever delivery can be taken), the cargoes of Dutch vessels requisitioned in British ports have not been requisitioned, but, will be stored till fetched. Cargoes of vessels at Gibraltar will be brought to the United Kingdom, and vessels at Hong Kong with cargoes fox-Japan and San Francisco will be allowed to complete their voyages. Lord Reading reports that, action&apos;on simitar lines is being taken by the United States War Trade Board.Food Supply. According to a Press report, the reduction in the bread ration and the sudden, rationing of meat to half a pound, weekly caused disturbances and led to the plundering of bakers&apos; shops and carts, in Amsterdam and Rotterdam on April 4th. FLet Yolk, in leading article entitled &quot; It is becoming intolerable,&quot; criticises the adminis-trafion of Post hum a and discloses (what the paper considers as) the fact that the army are keeping in the fortress of Amsterdam foodstuffs for several months for the emergency of a siege, &quot;while everybody knows Amsterdam could stand, no siege at all.&quot; dire Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant of April 4th hints that foreign countries should contribute to the food supply of their nationals in Holland (and see under-&quot; General.&quot;) Sir W. Townley reports that, owing to the blockade, the Dutch are now-reduced to consuming their home produce. On April 9th the Burgomaster of Rotterdam, under instructions from the Minister of Agriculture, prohibited-the exporta-tion of provisions for Belgian relief. At the protest, of the French and Belgian Ministers the Premier has rescinded this order so far as concerns such provisions already in the country ; he proposes, however, to retain any further supplies arriving, pending an arrangement with the Allied Governments.British. Export Restrictions. The  Foreign Office  announces,  on April  6th,  the relaxation restrictions upon the export to Holland of a variety of articles.Dutch-German Negotiations. Sir W. Townley learns that the economic negotiations between the Netherlands and German Governments are at a standstill. Meanwhile, imports of coal, iron, and steel into Holland have stopped, and, owing to home requirements, Dutch exports of butter and cheese are no longer possible. It is reported that a refusal by Germany to provide coal will be met by the discontinuance of Dutch credits to Germany. Mr. Kroeller, one of tlie Dutch negotiators, has resigned.SWITZERLAND.German Intrigue. The Foreign Office has received reports indicating an intention by Germany to create the impression that, the Allies contemplate the invasion of Switzerland.Col ton. The Foreign Office informs Sir H. Rumbold that the Allied Governments have raised the embargo on cotton and cotton goods against Switzerland as from. April 1st.Transit Traffic through Germany. The Foreign. Office instructs His Majesty&apos;s-Ambassadors in Paris and Rome as to certain undesirable results of the existing transit traffic from Switzerland through Germany to the Northern Neutrals, and enquires the views of the French and Italian Governments as to the desirability of its cessation pending enquiry.Question of German Safe Conduct for Food Ships. An official statement issued in Berne (April 2nd) says : &quot;Contrary to the statement from Washington circulated in &quot; the Bress that Germany has refused a safe conduct to the Dutch ships placed at the
&quot; disposal of the Swiss Government by the United States for the purpose of conveying-&quot; food for Switzerland, the German reply on this subject has not yet been received. &quot; Germany has observed since the beginning of the war the principle of free passage &quot; for neutral ships transporting merchandise destined exclusively for Switzerland. &quot; In view of the critical food and cereal situation it is greatly to be hoped that in the &quot; special circumstances resulting from the requisitioning of Dutch ships an arrange-&quot; ment will be made which will assure a free passage to these ships, and the absolutely &quot; indispensable arrival of cereals for Switzerland.&quot; German Wireless of April 4th. quotes theNorddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung as declaring that in spite of the, transfer -of Dutch vessels to the enemy flag, the German Government is negotiating with Switzerland for an understanding as to their use for supply of provisions.NORWAY.Socialism. Sir M. Findiay reports that the management of the Socialist Party has, as the result of a vote at the recent Conference, passed into the hands of the Extremists (see Report No. 62). The former leaders have refused to take any share in the direction of the Party, but retain control of the Trades Unions. As yet there has been no split between the old and new parties ;. and the Extremist leaders, realising the comparative insecurity of their position, have moderated their policy to the extent of advocating parliamentary methods ; so that for the present an attempt at revolution is improbable (and see Report No. 62).(And see under &quot;Finland.&quot;)SWEDEN.Swedish Negotiations with the Allies and Germany. Sir E. Howard learns that the German Government is insisting on a minimum annual exportation of 4,000,000 tons of iron ore from Sweden, and in expectation of an assurance to that effect has con-sented to continue the export of coal to Sweden until April 20th, on the basis of 150,000 tons a month. In regard to the proposed tonnage agreement between Sweden and the Allies, Germany demands from [the Swedish Government an under-taking that not more than 400,000 tons shall in future be chartered to the Allied Governments.FINLAND (and ALAND).Fighting. Finnish Headquarters announce that the Whites have surrounded a Russian force in Karelia, and taken 1,000 prisoners and 11 guns. Sir E. Howard learns that they are still most anxious to annex Eastern Karelia, the Murman Coast, and the Kola Peninsula. The Foreign Office instructs Sir E. Howard to convey (unofficially) to the Finnish Government a warning against hiterference with the Murman Railway. (And see Reports Nos. 60, 61 and 62.) Russian Wireless of April 4th announces the determination of the Bolshevist Government to deal in the most energetic manner with the incursions of the White Finns into Russian territory.German Troops. An official communique from Berlin announces the landing of German troops near Hango on April. 3rd. An unofficial Wasa telegram states that these consist of 40,000 men, with 300 guns and 2,000 machine guns. Sir E. Howard reports that, according to the Finnish Legation in Stockholm, not more than 17,000 troops have, in fact, been landed. Mr. Grove reports that the troops arrived in three transports accompanied by a large fleet, including three battleships. The Press reports the following order of the day (April 8th) issued by General Mannerheim : -&quot; At the request of the Finnish Government detachments of Germany&apos;s victorious and &quot; powerful army have landed on Finnish soil to help us drive out the Bolshevists &quot; and their murderous adherents. lam convinced that this brotherhood in arms, &quot; which during the present struggle is being sealed with blood, will only serve to &quot; strengthen the friendship and confidence that Finland has always felt for Germany&apos;s &quot; great Kaiser and his mighty people. I hope that Finland&apos;s young army now &quot; fighting side by side with Germany&apos;s historic troops may become permeated with &quot; that iron discipline, perfect order, and lofty sense of duty which served to create *&apos; the greatness of Germany&apos;s army and which have led it on from victory to victory.
In bidding Germany&apos;s brave warriors welcome to Finland, I therefore trust that &apos;&apos; every man in the Finnish army will prove his appreciation of the great sacrifice &apos;&apos; which Germany&apos;s noble people are now making for our country, at a time when &quot; every man is needed for their own country&apos;s war.&quot;Anti-Ally Manifestations in Wasa. The chief Wasa newspaper, Vasabladet, on April 1st wrote: &quot; JMo military or other similar persons from any of &quot; the countries at war with Germany ought &apos;to be allowed to stay within. &apos;&quot; the borders of our country so long as we, with the help of God and &quot; Germany, are&quot; fighting our hard fight for liberty, order, and justice against the &quot; barbarous Ally of the Western Powers.&quot; With regard to the hostile attitude recently displayed by Jager officers towards Allied, officers at Wasa (see Report No. 62), Sir E. Howard reports that, following upon the apology immediately tendered by General IViannerheim, a representative of the Finnish Legation in Stockholm has unofficially apologised, and has stated that the principal offender is under arrest and awaiting a court-martial. The conduct of Mr. Sario in the matter is being made the subject of strong remonstrances by the British and United States Governments. Sir E. Howard learns that President Swinhufvud has replaced Mr. Sario by Mr. Reri vail, as Foreign. Minister ; Mr. Sario remains, however, as Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.Norwegian Opinion on Finnish-German Ambitions. An article in the semi-official. Norske Intilligenssedler observes&quot;: &quot; Secure in Germ any&apos;s powerful assistance, Finland &quot; is beginning to dream of expansion. General Mannerheim has drawn a picture of &quot; a great Finland embracing Russian Ivarelen. The Bolshevist Government has &quot; promised Finland a strip of the Arctic coast, but this is not enough, and the old &quot; Finnish organ, IJusi Suometar, hints that the only satisfactory solution is the acquisi-&quot; lion of Pasvikelven, a piece of Norwegian territory. . . With Finland under &quot; a German protectorate, and the Baltic provinces under German influence, the Baltic &quot; will be really a German sea, and the course of events must be watched with anxiety.&quot; In Tidens Tegn (March 20th) Professor Chr. Collin is the author of a leading article on the &quot; Finnish Annexation Policy,&quot; in which he points out that if Finland, with Germany&apos;s help, robs Russia of her ice-free port on the Kola peninsula, she will be bound to Germany as a vassal State and doom the country to be a future field, of battle. Professor Collin also draws special, attention to the suggestion that Sweden should make a bargain with Finland at the cost of Russia. Sweden, is to have the Alands and a little part of Russian Lapmarken on condition that she strongly supports Finland:&apos;s claim on Karelen and the Kola peninsula. Sweden is to join the ranks of the States who are enriching; themselves at the cost of Russia, and thus bind herself for the future to be a German frontier-guard against Russia. No greater help could be afforded by any Scandinavian country to a Germany striving for world-empire than to bind herself to her, together with Finland, by receiving some of the plunder from the partition of Russia. The prospect of a Finnish-Germ an war base on the Kola peninsula does not frighten the minority in Sweden, who have from the war&apos;s commencement desired to join Germany. A Finnish-German port for cruisers and U-boats on the ice-free part of the Murman coast is just what certain &quot; Greater Swedish &quot; circles in Sweden desire. Comment iw needless. (And see Report No. 62 under &quot;Sweden.&quot;) (The Bolshevist Government by Wireless. of April 9th protests to Germany against Finnish incursions into Russian territory.)Russo-German Naval Discussions. German Wireless of April 4th requests &quot; exact information in the shortest possible time of all barrages laid by Russia in the Baltic Sea,&quot; According to German Wireless of April 6th the Bolshevist Government has ordered Russian minesweepers to clear the mines from the Gulf of Finland, and the Russian part of the Baltic Sea. Russian Wireless of April. 6t.li demands the return to Russia (in accordance with paragraph 6 of the Brest Treaty) of Russian naval and mercantile vessels and all property, supplies and&apos; crews taken by Germany in Russian coastal ports. Complaint is made of German landings at such ports and of the German naval advance on Helsingfors. It is added that instructions have been given to the Baltic Sea Command to enter into negotiations with the German Command. According to a Press report the Germans at Han go are making the following demands : (1) The cessation of the destruction of ships, harbours, and forts in Finland. (2) The bolts and sights of guns on board ships and in land batteries must be loaded in barges to be anchored in the outer bay of Gustavsvarn (a fortress south-east of Hangb) before April 11th. (3) The crews of all Russian warships must return to Russia.   Thirty men, however, will be allowed to remain on board the
Russian Dreadnoughts, 20 men on board the cruisers, five on destroyers, and three on -submarines, ddie Germans base their demands upon the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which, they state, does not contain a note to Article 6 allowing the Russian fleet to remain in Finland until the ice melts.Food Supply. ddie Foreign Office learns that the German Government has -declared or professed its inability to supply at present more than an extremely limited quality of foodstuffs to Finland. Sir E. Howard has been authorised (subject to the concurrence of the Allied Governments) to inform the Finnish Government that the Allied Governments will be prepared to render all possible assistance to Finland, for the needs of both parties alike, so soon as that country shall have freed itself from foreign intervention and civil strife ; and to this end would regard, with sympathy :any offer of mediation made by the Swedish Government. Guarantees would be necessary that supplies so forthcoming should not be re-exported, and the Finnish would be expected to refrain from attempting the forcible acquisition of territory, whether from Russia or Scandinavia, ddie Foreign Office represents to Lord Reading that the United States&apos; offer (see Report No. 62), pending a clarification of the position, should he held up. Sir E. Howard submits the desirability of according provisional recognition to the Finnish Government so soon as it shall have demonstrated a sincere neutrality.Aland. The Finnish Governor of Aland, in a recent interview given to a news-paper called Aland, stated that the population could be assured, that guarantees woidd be given insuring them considerable freedom, both in administration and language. Should the islands remain part of Finland, it would be the right of the population to demand such guarantees from Finland. In fact he would go so far as to say that he would consider it quite proper that the validity of such agreements and treaties should be guaranteed by the other Baltic Powers, more especially by Sweden and Germany, ddie Aland question wras no longer a private Finnish affair; it had an international character, and in view of political events which had just occurred or were impending the Alanders could gain better security and prospects in union with Finland than they had ever enjoyed. Sir E. Howard observes that hitherto the Finnish Government has maintained the Aland question to be purely Finnish, and that it would therefore appear from this interview that Germany is putting pressure upon Finland regarding the islands, ddiis tends to confirm the statement of Air. Ryden (see Report No. 62 under &quot;Sweden&quot;) that a deal was being arranged between. Germany and the Swedish Conservatives. Recent remarks by Dagens Nyheter and Nya Allehanda seem calculated to prepare the ground for such a -compact.SPAIN.The New Administration. ddie Political Intelligence Department points out that the solution of the Ministerial crisis in Spain, (see Report No. 61) affords a striking-proof of the value of the Monarchy as an institution. It also emphasises the signi-significance of La Cierva&apos;s exclusion, and quotes the observation of a French paper that &quot; The true name of the new Cabinet is Supremacy of the Civil Power.&quot; The problem of Army reform and discipline, however, remains outstanding: in addition to the question of military intervention in politics, there is that of a closer relation between the cost and the efficiency of the Army, ddie new Administration, is manifesting an inclination to take serious notice of the submarine campaign against Spanish shipping.Barcelona. Sir A., Hardinge reports the re-establishment, by Royal Decree, of -constitutional guarantees.in the city and province of Barcelona.(And see under &quot;Morocco.&quot;)MOROCCO.German Intrigues. ddie Times of April 8th sets out, the heads of proposals made to Raisuli by Germans in Morocco for busting both French and Spanish influence from Morocco, and declaring a so-called independent Morocco tied hand and. foot to Germany. Madrid papers (April oth).state : &quot; The situation in Morocco clue to the &quot; Germau intrigues is being closely followed. After a meeting of the Cabinet to-day &quot; a semi-official note was issued stating that the question had been discussed in detail, and that the possibility of further Spanish action in Morocco was considered.&quot;
Government Appointments. A Peking- message to tlie Tokyo Asalil (April 2nd) states that the following new Cabinet appointments are announced : -War; Tuancbijui, nephew of the Prime Minister. Education. Futsen gh-siang. Justi ce. Chusheu.The composition of the rest of the Cabinet remains unchanged. Tsac-Jii-lin, Minister of Communications, is, however, appointed concurrently to the Ministry of Finance. He is described as pro-Japanese, and his appointment, combined with the--visit of Baron Sakatani, a Japanese ex-Minister, whose name has been mentioned in connection with the financial advisorship, and who is accompanied by a numerous staff, is causing much speculation.Enemy Aliens. Sir. J. Jordan reports the acceptance by the Chinese Premier of the Allied Note (as amended) in regard to the deportation of enemy aliens. (See Reports Nos. 57, 58 and 61.) The necessity of this measure is evidenced., by Hie fact that a party of Turks has recently travelled freely through the neighbourhood of Siamfu, and that the German Consulate at Tientsin was carrying on its activities so lately as March 15th. .URUGUAY.Uruguay and Germany. Mr. Mitchell Inn.es reports that the Uruguayan Govern-ment has demanded from the German Government an explanation regarding the recent detention by a German submarine of an Uruguayan Military Mission travelling in the Spanish S.S. Infanta Isabel, and the treatment of its members as prisoners of Avar. It is probable that a declaration of war will follow. The Foreign Office learns that the maintenance of a firm attitude by Uruguay may not be without its effect upon, the policy of the &quot;Argentine Republic.BRAZIL.Finds of Iron Pyrites and Sulphur. The Lisbon Jornal do Gommercio learns that in the district of Alfonso Olaudio, in the Province of Espirito Santo in Brazil, a large deposit of iron pyrites, containing 38 per cent, of iron and 58 per cent, sulphur has been found. Borings in the vicinity disclosed enormous layers of sulphur easy of excavation. (Hamburgischer Correspondent, February 25th.)GUATEMALA.Enemy Trading. Mr. Young reports the continued activity of German firms in Guatemala, especially in the coffee trade, with ivhich the economic interests of Guatemala are closely associated.MEXICO.United States and Mexico. Mr. Cummins learns that the United States prohibition of various commodities for export to Mexico owing to the intransigeaiice of the Mexican Government -is causing much discontent amongst Mexicans. It would appear-that the Carranza administration still relies upon the ability- of Germany to enable Mexico to obtain such requirements by force. Carranza is contemplating the discontinuance of maize purchases from the United States.CUBA.Censorship. -Lord Reading reports that arrangements have now been made under which, the British and Allied Representatives at.Havana will be kept in touch with the Cuban-American Censorship organisations (see Report No. 59).SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of&apos; 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during&apos; the period March
1313029tli-Apr.il 4th. inclusive, was 42,288 tons gross, of which 1.(3,121 were British, as compared with 65,520 tons gross, of which 34,835 were British, reported last week.Merchant Vessel Construction. The Admiralty reports that the number and gross tonnage of merchant steamships of 100 tons and upwards reported completed in the United Kingdom during the first quarter of 1.918 are as follows : No. of GrossMonth. Vessels.        Tonnage.January 21. 58,568February       - - - 33 100,038March     - - - - 45 161,674Total for Quarter - - 99    .        320,280The- tonnage completed in March, is higher than in any month of 1917, the greatest monthly output in that year being 158,826 tons in November, while in addition, the tonnage launched but not completed was slightly greater at the end than at the beginning of March. The total merchant shipbuilding output for the first quarter of this year is less than the forecast to the extent of approximately 100,000 tons, and is less by almost the same figure than the output actually realised in the last quarter of 1917.Convoy. System.. &apos; The Ministry of Shipping reports that of 7,315 ships (36,152,703 M^cideadweight capacity), convoyed (homewards and outwards) up to March 30th, 1918, 80 (580,800 deadweight capacity) have been lost, representing a percentage of LOS in ships and I&apos; 12 in deadweight capacity.The Foreign Office informs Sir A. Hardinge that Spanish vessels   bound  for America will be permitted to join convoys.Japanese Shipping. Lord Reading reports the conclusion of arrangements under which the United States Shipping Board charters 150,000 tons of Japanese tonnage for six months, and also purchases 100,000 tons of Japanese tonnage for delivery from May to September (and see Reports Nos. 54 and 59).(And sec under &quot; Netherlands,&quot; &quot;Switzerland,&quot; and &quot;Sweden.&quot;)BEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. All countries are awaiting the issue of the struggle on the Western Front, and peace discussions are in abeyance. The best summary of the attitude of neutrals can be given in the words attributed to Raisuli : &quot; The ouly way to be sure of a German victory is an acknowledgment of defeat by Germany&apos;s adversaries.&quot; (Times, April. 8th.) German Wireless is becoming very audacious in prevarication, attributing to us (April 9th) an official statement that we had taken Ostend and Douai, and 140,000 German prisoners !Russia.. On April 5th M. Chicherin sent a wireless message to Vienna expressing the willingness of the Russian Government to form, in accordance with the Peace Treaty, a mixed Commission for the solution of all questions concerning prisoners of Avar, and asking to be informed of the composition of the Austro-Hungarian Delegation, the road by which they would travel to Russia, and the place where they would enter the country.On the same date M. Chicherin communicated by wireless to Constantinople his willingness to enter into negotiations with Turkey, in order to arrive at an agreement about, mercantile navigation.German Wireless of April 6th reported the publication by Maxim Gorky&apos;s paper of a secret document alleged to contain the proces-verbal of a special Council, held by the Russian Government, five months before the war, to draw up a plan for the conquest of Constantinople and the Dardanelles, and also a plan for the war which? &quot;-would, thereby become unavoidable &quot; against Germany and Austria-Hungary.   The54S1A21
Czar Nicholas. .11. is alleged to have confirmed the protocol of the sitting in the words : &quot; The resolutions of the Council i approve in their whole extent.&quot; [This is reminiscent of the &quot; Convention Anglo-Beige &quot; German propaganda.]On. April 7th Russian Wireless published a message from M. Chicherin to Berlin stating that on April 3rd1 the Government of the Russian Republic, after the ratification of the Brest Treaty, had sent a wireless message to the Ukraine Rada at Kieff in the following words: &quot;The Government of the&apos;Russian Republic, being &quot; compelled to conclude a Peace Treaty with the Rada of the People&apos;s Ministers, &quot; having regard, to the ultimatum of February 2nd and the Brest-Litovsk Peace &quot; Treat,y, suggests the town of Smolensk as the place for these negotiations. It is &quot; proposed that the negotiations should begin on April 6th of this year.&quot; M. Chicherin asked the German Government to forward the message to Kieff, in case it should not have reached its destination, but added that the date must now be altered, from the 6th to the 8th of April.   (See also under Ukraine.)On April 5th Mr. Wardrop (Moscow) reported that the Allied Consular represen-tatives in Moscow had been asked to supervise the execution of the peace treaty arranged at Odessa on March 9th between Russia and Rumania. (See also under Rumania.)Ustlionia. Sir W. Townley on April 3rd drew attention to an article in Voricartz of March 31st which exposes German propaganda methods as affecting the question, of self-determination, in countries coming under German influence under the conditions of the Brest Treaty. The Voricartz calls attention to cases in which proclamations which express themselves in favour of annexation to Germany are given the widest publicity, without mention of the circumstances under which they were composed. Counter proclamations, however, only see the light of publicity by mistake. Attempts to annex Esthonia and Lithuania to Germany are therefore nothing less than attempts to commit robbery on a State (Russia) with which peace has just been concluded.Ukraine. Lord Bertie on April 3rd forwarded a report from the Allied Ministers at Jassy, based on very reliable information, to the effect that Germany and Austria-Hungary intend arbitrarily to extend the Ukraine frontier so as to include all parts of Russia which they want to administer, either from the economic or from the political point of view. There seems to be some prospect of the Germans and Austrians squabbling for the spoils, and of there being a reaction in the country from which the spoils are to he taken against the Austro-German exploitation of their resources. In this connection. Russian AVireless of April 3rd-4th published a proclamation addressed &quot;&apos; To Ail&quot; containing a protest by the &quot; Krivoi Rog Republic on the Don&quot; against the violation of their frontiers by German, Austrian, and Ukrainian, forces. The frontiers are described in detail. An armistice is asked, for, for the purposes of peace negotiations and the demarkation of the frontiers. (This subject is dealt with more fully in the Eastern Report.) Russian Wireless of April 8th published, a protest addressed by Chicherin to Berlin against the entrance of German troops into the Kursk district, which does not form part of the Ukraine, &quot; even according to the one-sided statement of the Ukrainian Delegation.&quot; (The Germans base their policy of plunder on that statement, see former Reports.)German Wireless of April 4th reported on the authority of Petrograd that the Ukraine Rada had submitted the Peace Treaty (with Germany ?) to the Council of the people&apos;s Delegates.German Wireless of April 5th pressed the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs at Moscow to enter into negotiations with the Ukraine Rada without delay, and on April 8th announced, the intention of the Russian Government to open peace  negotiations with the Ukraine at Smolensk. (See also under Russia.^ Mr. Wardrop on April 6th forwarded a report that the peace negotiations between Russia and the Ukraine would probably be signed at Smolensk, but, being extorted by force, would have no more value than, the Peace Treaty at Brest.Rumania. Sir G. Barclay (V April 3rd) reported that the Allied Ministers at Jassy had recommended certain action by the French, Italian, and British Govern-ments in connection with the proposals of the Central Powers as affecting the Danube Commission.1 Dated April4th in the Russian Wireless as received.
On April 4th Lord Bertie reported on - the same authority that the Prime Minister had returned to Jassy from Bucharest, and the date of: the return of von Kuhlmann and Czernin&apos; to continue the peace negotiations had not been fixed. A further suspension of the negotiations was reported by Sir O. Barclay on the same day.On April 6th Lord Bertie forwarded a report from the Allied Ministers at Jassy of a proposal by the Bolshevists at Moscow to come to an understanding with Rumania too late.On the same date Sir G, Barclay reported the terms agreed upon at Odessa on March 9th between the Russians and Rumanians, chiefly affecting repatriation of the latter.   (See also under Russia.)Lord Bertie sent on April 8th a reliable report, from Jassy that M. Margluloman was going to Bucharest in a few days to sign the peace treaty. Bulgaria (as anticipated in former reports) is not to get the Dobrudja until a general peace. It is said that the port of Uonstanza and the railway to Ozernavode are to be under international control.   (See also under Austria-Hungary.)Germany.-A report has readied, the Foreign Office to the effect that Germany-does not wish Bulgaria to have her ambitions fully satisfied, because in that case Bulgaria would become too powerful and upset the balance of power in the Balkan States. (See also under Rumania, last, paragraph.) This Avould interfere with German intentions as affecting Turkey. Should the Central Powers be sufficiently successful in the war it is proposed that Bulgaria should have Nish, the Dobrudja, Kavalla, and Seres. Germany is said to want a free market in Persia, and is reported to have mentioned Afghanistan in the Russo-Germau Peace, &quot; just as a pin-prick at a very susceptible point.&quot; Although it was proposed that Poland, Lithuania, the Ukraine, and other portions of Russia should be made into semi-independent States, their railways, posts, telegraphs and armies should be controlled by Germany. This policy would -avoid the difficulty of giving them representation in the Reichstag, to which they would be entitled if their countries were openly annexed and. incorporated into the German .Empire. The intention was to preserve Rumania, giving her Bessarabia ; Germany to control the Rumanian Army, railways and posts ; all surplus Rumanian produce to be appropriated to the Central Empires. The Aland Islands to be restored to Finland, and not, given to Sweden. Opinion in Germany is said to be divided about Belgium and the Flanders coast. As regards the Colonies, the militarists are said, to be very anxious to form a great Pro-tectorate in Central Africa, and. they might let the Pacific Islands and South-West Africa go in order to achieve this object. All Germans are agreed about the retention of Alsace-Lorraine, and there is a general wish to make Italy suffer seme mutilation.The same authority attributed to Ludendorff the saying: &quot;That one does not &quot; fight battles to defeat the opposing army, but to stimulate the desire for peace &apos;&quot; behind, the opposing army.&quot; The German hope is to gain military successes, and to combine with, them an intense defeatist campaign in Allied countries in order to firing about a peace satisfactory to Germany. (Note. There are ample signs all over the world of the truth of this appreciation of German policy of propaganda.)On April 4th Sir W. Townley drew attention to an article in the Frankfurter Zeitung of April 2nd, criticising HindenburgA message to the Reichstag in favour of a &quot; strong German peace.&quot;Berlin Wireless of April 6th publishes a x^rotest addressed to the Russian Govern-ment by Baron von dear Bussche about the alleged treatment of German officers accused of espionage in Petrograd, claiming their indemnity under &quot; Article 23 of the Supplementary Treaty to the Russo-German Peace Treaty.&quot;2Austria-Hungary. Count Gzernin&apos;s speech to a deputation of the Vienna City Council on April 2nd was referred to last week. Fuller accounts have since been received. The indications he gives of the peace terms to be forced upon Rumania show that he was not sincere in his acceptance of the principle of &quot;no annexa-tions&quot; at Brest (see Western Report, No. 49). Pie now explains that certain mountain passes and strategic points are to be given up by Rumania. Pie also explains that the Central Bowers expect to get at least a million tons of grain from the Ukraine, which they cannot at present transport. &quot; Russia did. not come into consideration in this connection,&quot; on the plea that Russia also was unable to distribute it. He indicates in general terms the economic advantages and &quot;indemnification &quot; to be wrung from the Rumanians. (See also under Rumania.) He stated that &quot;a short time before the beginning of the offensive.in the;West1 Count Czernin&apos;s return to Bucharest lias since been reported.2 Russian Wireless of April 9tli reports an order for the liberation of these officers.
&quot; Clemenceau enquired of me whether and upon what basis I was prepared to &quot; negotiate.&quot; To this M. Clemenceau has replied : &quot; Czernin has lied &quot; (Temps, April 3rd). Subsequent communiques show that M. clemencoau  used the right expression. He (Count Czernin) put forward a belated withdrawal of Ids other false statement that &quot; President Wilson already had knowledge &quot; of his former speech at the time it was delivered, and now states (two months afterwards) &quot; 1 supposed that it would have already reached Washington.&quot; Sir W. Townley on April 7th forwarded extracts from the German press showing pleasure at Count Czerhins speech, and especially of his adherence to the German alliance. His advances to President Wilson are criticised.Turkey. According to German Wireless of April 5th, the Turkish Chamber has empowered, the Government to sign the peace treaty with Russia and the Ukraine.United States. The Times of April.8th publishes long extracts from the speech delivered by. President Wilson at Baltimore on April 6th. In that speech he confessed, his &quot; utter disillusionment &quot; as to the attitude of the Central Powers,, accepted the German challenge that force and force alone should decide the issues, and pledged the United States of America to use &quot; force, force to the utmost, force without stint or limit,&quot; against Germany. Lord Reading on April 7th reported the enthusiastic reception of the PresidouPs speech, which words the views of the whole country.Great Britain. In their report for the period ending on April 3rd,- the Ministry of Labour state that the gravity of the military situation is recognised in the Labour and Socialist Press, and even avowedly pacificist papers are moderate in tone.GENERAL.Dropping of Pamphlets by Airmen. The Foreign Office has given to the German-Government four weeks&apos; notice of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take immediate reprisals in all cases where captured British airmen,are treated otherwise than as prisoners of war for dropping pamphlets on German or German-occupied territory, or having their machines equipped for that purpose. (See Reports Nos. 54, 58, 59, 61.)Food Supply of Prisoners of War interned, in Holland. -Handelsblad criticises M. Posthuma for stating that the British Government had not replaced foodstuffs distributed to British prisoners, and declares that this statement has contributed considerably to bad feeling and that Posthuma, who ought to have known better, has undeservedly thrown odium upon the British Government. The paper assumes that by giving an incorrect idea-of the facts Posthuma was not prompted hy wrong intentions, but ought to have realised that by his &quot; carelessness &quot; he was creating an unjust and dangerous feeling which it was his duty to prevent. The Butch Press reports a statement by M. Loudon regarding the food, supply of prisoners of war interned in Holland, in the course of which he mentioned the undertaking given by the British Government (see Report No. 62), and observed, that no reply on the subject had yet been received from Germany. He added that the Netherlands did not propose to prohibit the transport of prisoners pending the fulfilment by the two Governments of their obligations. Measures would, however, be taken to limit the number of British and German subjects residing in Holland in connection with the&apos; interned prisoners.
appendixtoWestern and General Report No. 63.  Part II.imperialism&quot;  IN  war  aims.On account of the constant accusations made hy Germany against Great Britain of &quot; Imperialism,&quot; accusations that were also made by the Bolshevists by wireless from Petrograd during their &quot;peace &quot; negotiations with the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk, it is thought that the following summary will be found of value for comparison of facts with phrases.2. German armies crossed the Belgian frontier early on August 4th, 1914. Their \ object in doing so was explained at the time to be the defence of a Fatherland in danger of attack, but the true German war aim has now been confessed by the Imperial Chancellor, Count Hertling, to have been &quot;from the beginning&quot; .... &quot; economic development in every direction.&quot; He used this expression when referring to the economic advantages which the Germans, by the use of force, had been able to gain from Russia and the Ukraine in the &quot; peace &quot; treaties with those countries. This economic side of German aggression has also been emphasised from time to time by the German Colonial Secretary (Dr. so if), who is now asserting that in the peace settlement oversea possessions must be allotted to the Powers in proportion to their &quot;greatness &quot; and economic strength. On this basis he argues that France, Portugal and Belgium must be dispossessed in favour of Germany. (&quot; Greatness &quot; in Germany seems to be measured as a matter of course by the standard of the strength of armies.) The Kaiser has recently accentuated the prospect of a rick future, resulting from the employment of the German sword against neighbouring countries.3. Count Hertling and others have recently reverted to using the &quot; Convention Anglo-Beige &quot; myth as a justification for the German invasion of Belgium. It was thought that no more would be heard of this after Sir Theodore Cook had exposed the German forgeries and propaganda methods in his book The Mark of the Beast. (Subsequent German allegations in support of their case have been demolished, by the Belgians in a pamphlet called Les Chefs d&apos; Etat-Major de Varmee beige, et le respect de la Neubralite, by Major W. Marsily, of the staff, of the Belgian Army. Prince Lichnowsky &apos;s disclosures should finally dispose of the falsehoods.)The Frankfurter Zeitung, in a recent article, is, I think, the first leading paper in Germany to abandon the German case, on the ground that it was obvious, from Marshal. JofEre&apos;s actual strategy, that the violation of Belgian neutrality was not included, in his plan. The Frankfurter falls back on &quot; weighty strategical arguments &quot; for the German invasion of Belgium in other words, the argument for gaining a military advantage by breaking an international obligation. This falls in with the KaiseFs message, written in his own handwriting, to President Wilson on August 10th, 1.914: &quot;Belgian, neutrality had to be violated by Germany on strategical grounds.&quot;4. Germany having committed the first act of aggression in order to follow a Avar aim which has now been confessed officially to have been purely imperialistic from the beginning, it is clear that, after that date (August 4th, 1914), all operations of Avar undertaken against Germany and her Allies come under the heading of defensiA^e measures.   If there were no hitting back in Avar the aggressor would invariably win.5. It is proposed in this paper to summarise the different blows that have been struck hy ourselves and Allies against enemy territory since August 4th, 1914, under the headings (I) Naval attacks, and (2) Military invasions of territory, giving the date of each initial attack, ddiese dates haATe been provided by the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   The European theatre of Avar is hot dealt with-.5481-2!) - E
IS(1) NAVAL ATTACKS.As a measure for protecting sea communications, of vital importance to the United Kingdom and the Dominions, it was essential, as soon as Germany engaged on her offensive war, to deprive her of naval bases, wireless stations, cable stations and fuelling stations, and as far as possible to break up the system of intelligence she had established to assist in her attacks upon our commerce. With this object in view the . following naval attacks were undertaken :: Atlantic Ocean.Togoland. See below, under &quot; Military Invasions,&quot; for Lome and the W/T station. .German Cameroon.?. Duala was bombarded on September 26th, 191-1, to cover the landing referred to below, under &quot; Military Invasions.&quot;German South-West Africa.

The invasion of German East Africa was preceded by a German invasion of British East African territory. The British. Army advanced into Palestine to drive back a Turkish army, which had invaded Egypt and threatened the Suez Canal. . The advance in Mesopotamia originated in operations to defend British oil interests in Southern Persia. In other cases military occupations were extensions of naval attacks in order (1) to capture wireless and cable stations, and so break up the system of intelligence upon which the German attacks on our commerce were based, and (2) to seize and occupy her naval bases and fuelling stations, so depriving her commerce raiders of their use. In some cases, as in the Cameroons, extended operations in the Hinterland followed the capture of harbours, and prevented their recapture by forces in the interior.Togoland. On August 8th, 1914, a British force seized Lome. After subsequent operations, the wireless telegraph station inland, at Kamina was destroyed by the Germans on the night of August 24th-25th, 1914, the colony surrendered on August 26th, .1914, and Ivamina was occupied by the British on the following day.German Cameroons. On August 6th, .1914, a French force occupied Zinga. On September 26th a combined force landed at Duala. Operations by British and French forces brought about the surrender of the last garrison on February 18th, 1916. (See also under &apos;&quot;&apos; Naval Attacks &quot; above.)[Angola (Portuguese). On. October 26th, 1914, German forces crossed the frontier, and were thrown back from Naulila and from Tombe.]German South-West Africa. -It has been proved that, before 1914, the Germans had been engaged in fomenting a rebellion in the Union of South Africa. The Maritz rebellion&apos; came to a head on October 9th, 1914. On August 21st, 1914, a a German force crossed the frontier and occupied a position three miles south of Nakob in Cape Province. Luderitzbucht was occupied by South African forces landed on September 19th, 1914. On September 21st, a South African force crossed the frontier and seized Sandfontein, 15 miles north of Ramans Drift. On January 14th, 1915, Swakopmund was occupied by a South African force. The big wireless telegraph station at Windhuk was captured on May 12th, 1915, and the colony surrendered to General Botha on July 9th, 1915.[British East Africa. On August 15th, .1914, a force from German East Africa crossed the frontier and occupied Taveta.]German East Africa. (See under &quot;Naval Attacks&quot; above.) A Belgian force crossed the frontier and occupied Goma on October 14th, 1914. A British force crossed the frontier and. attacked Longido on November 3rd, 1914.   On the same dayMany of these attacks were in aid of militaiy operations.
a force, landed in. the neighbourhood, attacked Tanga. On August .16th, 19.1.6, a. Belgian force captured Tabora, where the powerful wireless telegraph station was-located. After subsequent operations on a large scale German East Africa was. cleared of German forces by December 1st, 1917.Samoa. (See under &quot;Naval Attacks &quot; above. - The New Zealand force, landed on August 29th, 1914, remained in occupation.)German New Guinea. (See under &quot; Naval Attacks &quot; above.

After capture by combined Japanese and British forces on November 7th, 1914, a Japanese garrison remained in occupation.)Bed Sea.   (See above for &quot;Naval Attacks,&quot; in aid of military operations.)Egypt. On September 27th, 1914, Lord Kitchener ordered the General Officer Commanding in Egypt to hold the Suez Canal tenaciousby, but to let the Turks be tlie undoubted aggressors.About October 25th, 1914, an Arab force arrived at Maghdaba in Egyptian territory, but turned back. A. Turkish army, led by Germans, moved forward along the El-Arish-Kantara road on January 27th, 1915, and developed an attack on the Suez Canal on February 2nd, 1915. They were subsequently driven back out of Egyptian territory, and crossed the Turkish- frontier on January 9th, 1917, followed by a British force. A subsequent Turkish incursion into the Sinai Peninsula ended about February 20th, 1917. Jerusalem was captured on December 11th, 1917, and operations are still proceeding.   (Sec cdso under &quot; Naval Attacks, Red Sea,&quot; above.)Mesopotamia. On November 6th, 1914, a British force attacked and took Fao.. The object was to protect the oil-works of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from the Turks. British forces subsequently advanced, and now hold Baghdad and sunrounding country.[It. is proposed to deal with the .Mediterranean in another paper. The opposed landing on the GaUipoli Peninsula began, on April 25th, 1915, and the landing at Salonika on October 5th, 1915.]G. G. A.April 9th, 1918.
