PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS.Allied Labour Mission to United States. The Foreign OIHce informs Lord Reading that certain representatives of the British, French, Italian and Belgian Labour Parties are desirous of proceeding to the United States to confer with the American Federation of Labour, and instructs him to invite the. views of the United States Government in the matter.Allies and the Far Fast. The Allied Premiers and Foreign Ministers have jointly informed President Wilson of their views on the question of intervention, and have invited his opinion. Meanwhile, according to information received by Sir J. Jordan, anarchy reigns in Siberia. The Bolshevists control all municipal and communal councils, and are encouraged by the Germans in a policy of destruction, thus preparing the way for passive conquest by Germany, which is already virtually accomplished. German prisoners are at large and ready to act in organised and disciplined bodies. German-Bolshevist penetration of China is becoming a possibility which must not be overlooked.Vladivostoch. The Foreign Office learns that the Bolshevists at Vlaclivostock recently attempted to enforce the control by workmen of commercial undertakings, and, as the result of opposition, arrested ten directors of the Customs Guilds and four other persons, including the President of the Chamber of Commerce. Owing to the protests of local firms and the threats of the newly raised White Guard, the prisoners were released. His Majesty&apos;s Consul emphasises the growing danger to military stores now- lying at Vladivostock.Far Eastern Committee. Sir J. Jordan reports the formation of a &quot;Far Eastern Committee&quot; at Harbin, having as its object the combating of anarchy and the activities of enemy prisoners in Eastern Siberia ; it also aims at ensuring the free and regular election of a Constituent Assembly. The Committee has been joined by the Russian Minister at Peking, General Horvat and M. Poutiloff, the two latter being in charge of local organisations and financial matters respectively. It claims to be in touch with various provinces of Siberia.Allied Coal Distribution. At a meeting of the Allied Maritime Transport Council on March 13th the French representatives agreed to continue the supply of coal to Italy at the present daily rate. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading, however, to secure, if possible, the allocation of not less than 70,000 tons of shipping, available in United States ports, to Allied service in such a way as to release corresponding tonnage for conveyance of coal from Great Britain to France.Purchase of Foodstuffs from United States. In  a Memorandum (G.T. 3875)dated January 12th particulars are given of the system of centralized purchase of foodstuffs now established for the purpose of preventing competitive buying and consequent inflation of prices.FRANCE.Charge against Captain Lacloux. Lord Bertie reports that Captain Ladoux, formerly Head of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of War, has been charged with complicity of commerce avec Vennemi in both the Humbert and Suzy Depsy affairs.Socialists. The Intelligence Bureau observes that the French nation is now more divided into sections than it ever was in the first three years of the war. The unfortunate decision of the Socialists to refuse office when M. Painleve and again when M. Clemenceau became Prime Minister ; their foolish and unsuccessful attempt to veto Clemenceau&apos;s appointment; their disgust at finding that a Ministry could be formed and could survive without them ; the folly of the Royalists and Reactionaries
in not being able to-resist the temptation to use M. Caillaux&apos; and other treason affairs to discredit Republican institutions; the fact that M. Clemeneeau is remembered rather bitterly by some of the working classes for the severity with which he suppressed strikes during his former Ministry; all these things have tended to create in and.out of Parliament a much, more definite and hostile opposition than existed a year ago. One sign or this is the formation of a Republican League intended, as its promoters assort, to defend the Republic against the concerted offensive of the Reaction. Its Committee is formed of members of the Extreme Left, a few well-known. Deputies like Violette, Renaudel and Dalbiez, Merrheim, the very Pacifist, and in other respects extreme, Labour Leader, and others more or less extreme of the same party. The chairman is Debierre, a Senator and the chairman of the Radical Socialist party. He-has issued a long.manifesto demanding the revival of the &apos;&apos; bloc &quot; of. the Left, denouncing the union sacree as a &quot; sacree duperie,&quot; attacking the alleged ill-treatment of Sarrail and other Republican Generals, and the alleged intrusions of the clerical spirit into the Army and especially into the hospitals, throwing doubt on the possibility of victory and distinguishing pacifism, from defailisrne. Against this must be ret the satisfactory fact that, on the whole the -war aims unanimously agreed upon in London by both the French and English Socialist and Labour Parties, and by Minority as well as by Majority, are very near those stated by Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Wilson. This has made a great change, and patriotic Socialists, who a few weeks ago took a very gloomy view of the prospect as to keeping the Socialists in line about the right sort of peace, have come back from London much more hopeful. They think that this comparative unanimity in war aims between Governments and Inte)-allied Labour-will have a very steadying effect both upon the Army, if it needs it, and upon the whole people at home. And it is undoubtedly assisted by the proceedings of the Germans in Russia.Explosion at a Grenade Factory. Lord Bertie reports a serious explosion on March 1.5th at a grenade factory at Courneuve, in the neighbourhood of Paris.ALBANIA.The Central Empires and the Economic Future of Albania. The Nieuiee Hotter da msche Couranl (January 26th) learns from a Balkan correspondent that the development of railways in Albania forms a portion of a scheme which is being-worked out in Germany and Austria-Hungary, to open up a new international route from South and West Germany via Bosnia to Albania and Western Greece, and thence by sea to Tripoli and East Africa, in connection with a direct line of steamers to India and Eastern Asia, The fertile plains on the Albanian Coast can be trans-formed by means of irrigation works into magnificent arable and pasture land. This project is already engaging the attention, of Austrian and Hungarian capitalists, who intend to plant there vines, olives, cotton trees, tobacco, and. roses for making attar of roses. Moreover, Albania is eminently adapted for sheep-raising and the culture of silk worms. Before the war there was an annual export of sheep&apos;s wool to the amount of 500,000 kg., and of silk worms to the amount of more than 50,000 kg. Up to the present there are practical^ no industries in Albania. There are only two grain mills and a&quot; few carpet and weaving factories. The same may be said of mining, but recent prospecting has shown, the presence in sufficiently remunerative quantities of chrome, quicksilver, copper, iron ore, petroleum&apos; and bitumen. Suitable labour will be forthcoming as soon as the Albanians, a strong, hardy and generally intelligent race, have grown accustomed to regular work. Deposits of coal have also been found, while owing to the almost universal supply of water motive power will be cheap. Forestry also affords good prospects. The highlands of the interior are covered with oak, beech and pine forests. For some years good profits have been made by the export of yellow wood (xanthoxylbn), which yields fustic, used in dyeing.  Weser Zeilung (February 8th).[Daily Review of Foreign Press.   Reconstruction Supplement, March 12th.]ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Austria and Bulgaria. The Foreign Office learns that the relations between Bulgaria and. Austria have recently become very close.
Fight between Czech and German Deputies. A Vienna telegram, of March 12th to the Vossische Zeitung describes a violent conflict in the Reichsrath between Czech and German Deputies. The incident arose out of the statement by Deputy Soukup that Prague was absolutely destitute of food, and the retort of Deputy Wolf, &quot; Why have not you Czechs disgorged ? You want to starve us. You are in alliance with England.&quot; The sitting was suspended during the ensuing disturbance, which lasted more than ten minutes.Central Empires and the Ukraine. The Foreign Office has received information to the effect that, under a secret, supplementary agreement between the Central Powers and the Ukraine, the Eastern portion of Galicia is to be created, an Austrian Crown Land with its own Elective Diet, on the model of Styria and Bohemia. Such an arrangement would tend on the one hand to encourage hopes of a similar qualified autonomy amongst other subject nationalities in Austria, and on the other to provoke further dissension between the Poles and the Ukrainians, who dispute predominance in Galicia.Supplies from the Ukraine. The Foreign Office learns that there is a probability that the Central Empires will obtain very little food from the Ukraine. According to one informant, 25 per cent, of its agricultural area was left uncultivated in 1911), and 40 per cent, in 1917. During the last few months the crops belonging to the big landowners (i.e., nearly half the total available crops) have been destroyed. If, as seems likely, the foodstuffs are requisitioned and not purchased, great resentment will lie aroused among the Ukrainians. Germania of March 14th is very pessimistic on the prospects of supply from the Ukraine. The Arbeiter Zeitung of March 15th. declares there are no hopes of supplies from Russia for at least three mouths. &quot; The unbearableiiess, wretchedness, pitiableness of tlm everyday life of millions has reached its culminating point.&quot; It describes the shortage and bad quality of food in Austria, and says that all. eyes are turned towards the East. In the second winter of the war supplies from Rumania were desperately slow in arriving: &quot; now we have to reckon with double the &quot; distance and a further reduction of one-half in the means of transport, which have &quot; also suffered the Avear and tear of another whole year of war. If the transport &quot; from Odessa to Vienna is to be as slow as that from one of our central stations to &quot; another at home, then this import from the East will come too late for the present &quot; crisis. It may be that Germany will again help us out, and that Hungary will &quot; remember her duty towards us by sending a few waggon loads. Such efforts are &quot; worthy of praise, but they do not help in the case of complete absence of food for &quot; the 17&apos;, millions dependent upon the State.&quot;Mr. Midler reports :  &quot; While perforce content to act jointly with Germany in the import of grain from Russia, Austria is losing no time in laying her plans for independent commercial enterprise. A joint committee of representatives of the largest export firms&apos; is to found a limited company to promote export trade with Russia, while a similar concern has already come into being at Lemberg representing the cities of Lemberg and Cracow. Brisk trade iDropaganda by specially printed periodicals is being-carried on among Russian prisoners of war. In comparison with the flamboyant generalities prophesying industrial expansion, comment on food prospects, and even upon the actual commodities to be looked for from Russia, is cautious. There is no continuance of: the widespread optimism of mid-December.&quot;The Admiralty learns that crews have been sent from Hamburg by rail to Constantinople to man German cargo vessels at that port, which are to transport wheat from Odessa. Crews haA-e also recently been recruited in North Sea and Baltic ports for a large number of harbour tugs which proceed from Emden to the Black Sea by way of Ems, the Ems-Rhine Canal, and the rivers Rhine and Main, and thence down the Danube, in order to tow into Germany barges of wheat obtained from Odessa. It is stated that 20 to 30 such tugs left Germany for that destination in /December and January last.Mr. Muller reports : Supplies from Italy. &quot; That great play was made of the relief likely to result from the occupation of Italian territory is well known.   It is therefore at once interesting
and gratifying to note that reports to date show how infinitesimal were the stocks of food and material thus obtained. Characteristic of the short-sighted and pseudo-henevolent optimism of the Austro-Hungarian Government is the assignment,.&apos; at the special request of the Emperor Charles,&apos; of two truck!oads of rice from the booty captured in Italy to the poor of Budapest for free distribution. Three weeks later a representative of the National Food Office stated that the rice received from Italy amounted to no more than five truckloads, of which Austria had received three and Hungary two these last, presumably, the fruit of Imperial, largesse. The latest reports to hand are even less comforting. &apos; There can be no question,&apos; says a German paper, &apos; of any export of food or fodder from Italy, as the stores in the country are not even sufficient for the needs of the Italian population.&apos; No doubt this statement is coloured by German desire to put an Ally in her place, but the same cannot be said of General Hofer&apos;s admission to a Hungarian journalist that the provisioning of the population of Venetia was no easy task, that available supplies in Italy had been greatly overrated, and that few traces had hitherto been found of the &apos; so-called Italian booty.&apos; &quot;Cotton Shortage. &quot; Such evidence as is available of the shortage of sewing cottou merely&apos; underlines -what has been said in previous Reports. At the beginning of January the authorities, yielding to great pressure, allotted 800 gross reels of cotton to Lower Austria for the tailoring trade and for private use. Sixteen thousand tailoring workshops in Vienna alonejwere expected to subsist for two months on 240 gross of reels, an achievement likely to prove somewhat difficult in view of the fact that normally Vienna absorbs more than 800 gross a week. An Army Order captured on Monte Asalone on January 14th, bearing probably a date in December, stated that the conquered territory in Italy was known to contain considerable quantities of wool and cotton waste, for which careful search must be made. Nevertheless, on the last day of December, the delegates of the Vienna tailoring industry held a meeting at -which, among other grievances, it was stated that not a single reel of cotton, for Austria had been obtained, from occupied Italy. The tailors, whose point of view is doubtless highly partial, maintained that profiteering middlemen were selling cotton at 30 kronen a reel, and even demanding food presents in exchange as well as money payment. As at most other similar meetings, the speakers had a great many grievances to ventilate, but no remedies to suggest. Reliable private information states that men&apos;s suits in Vienna cost 900 kronen and ordinary boots 200 kronen a pair.&quot;Strikes at Vienna and Budapest. A Vienna telegram ,to the Lokal-Anzeiger (March 14th) says that a strike has again broken out in Vienna and the neighbouring-industrial centres, ddie workmen in the North-Western Railway workshops struck, on March 12th, and were joined next day by the workshops of the State Railway and the Northern Railway. . Upon the threat of military intervention the workmen returned to the shops, but did not resume work. Several factories are already idle in Floridsdorf.A Vienna telegram to the Weser Zeitung (March 16th) sa\-s that a strike has broken out at Budapest, which appears to be assuming big proportions, as on&apos; the afternoon of March loth telegraphic communication with Budapest was suspended.And see under &quot;Albania.&quot;GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. . -2V(e Chancellor and the Generals. Sir H. Rumbold reports a statement that serious differences have arisen between Count Hertling and the German High Command. Ibhe Foreign Office learns that there is a considerable movement for the removal of General Ludendorff, who is considered the principal obstacle to reasonable peace proposals.Germany and Poland. The Berliner Tageblatt of March 13th reports that an inter-Party discussion of Reichstag leaders took place on the 12th. Later, the Party Leaders and the President of the Reichstag were received by the Chancellor. The conversations concerned Eastern questions and the approaching War Loan. With regard to Poland, &quot; it is believed that the Western Frontiers of the State will be &quot; recognised as they existed before, and general approval was shown to the wish of &quot; Poland to enter the Central European Alliance.   The protest of the Poles in Cholm5257-36 B V
&quot; would be most carefully enquired into, and the possibility must be given to Poland &quot; to extend its territory further eastwards in the direction of Western Russia, &quot;especially in the Minsk district. By this means a broad corridor would be &quot; established between Lithuania and Ukrainia to Russia.&quot;The Intelligence Bureau reports : Movements in German Jewry. The Jewish organisations in Germany have amalgamated into a &quot;Union of Jewish Organisations in Germany for safeguarding the rights of Jews in the East.&quot; -Steps are being taken to affiliate other Jewish organisations in Germany, and to found similar unions in Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria.   It is announced in a statement to the Press that: &quot; The Association has been formed to represent the opinion of German Jewry with regard to all the Jewish problems which may arise in the East both now, during the war, and at the Peace Conference.&quot;The following principles for the treatment of Jewish problems in the East and in the Ottoman Empire have been laid down as a result of the activities of the Association : &quot; (1) Legal and actual equality for Jews, with all the  rights and duties of citizens. &quot;(2) Religious freedom.&quot; (A) The right to an independent Jewish culture.&quot;(d) The right to free immigration and to economic activities in all parts of the Ottoman Empire.&quot; (5) The right to free immigration and to cultural autonomy in Palestine.&quot;The German Zionist Organisation is one of the few bodies affiliated to the Union, but its organ, the Jiuiische Rundschau, states (what is obvious from the programme just quoted) that the initiative came from the anti-Zionist organisations, and that the Zionists were only admitted under pressure of the situation.The programme is obviously a minimum from the Zionist point of view, and the last two clauses are perfunctory additions to the first three, which concern, the status of Jews, not in Palestine but in the former &quot; Jewish Pale &quot; of the Russian Empire and in Rumania.While the British advance in Balestine has deprived. Germany of direct control over the destinies of Zionism, the German advance in Russia, beyond the line reached in 191b, is bringing the whole of East European Jewry within the German sphere.As the essential reservoir for Palestinian colonisation, East European Jewry is of vital importance for Zionist aspirations. The Germans made effective propaganda out of the deportation of Jews from the evacuated territories by the Tzar&apos;s Government in 1915, but took little pains then to conciliate Jewish opinion. In the new municipal institutions which they created in Poland, they sacrificed Jewish security to Polish nationalism, but with the extension, of their conquests in. Eastern Europe, and the increase of their power, their policy shows signs of undergoing a change.A logical consequence of their recent alienation of the Poles for the sake of the Ukrainians would be the support of J wish claims in the Polish area, for the Poles are a formidable enough power to make it advisable for Germany, when once she has alienated them, to secure all the Allies against them that she can find.In Rumania, too. there are rumours that the Central Powers intend to insert stipulations in favour of Jewish rights in the peace treaty.Idle conciliation of the Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern Eu rop6 cis ci German &quot;culture asset&quot; has been preached by the Conservative-Zionist German-Jewish publicist Dr. Davis-Trietsch since the beginning of the war. It appears that the German Government is at last adopting his policy. On. Alarch 8th the German Wireless circulated a rumour (quoted from the Temps) that the Bolshevist Govern-ment at Petrograd has suspended all Jewish newspapers and arrested their editors, as well as the Chairman of the Organisation Committee of the forthcoming Russian Jewish Congress. If this is true, it plays into Germany&apos;s hands, and it is in the new German dependencies in. Eastern Europe, rather than in the Ottoman Empire, that the most serious counter-offensive to British Zionist policy is to. be expected. (See also Report No. 58.)Germany and Ireland. German Wireless of March&apos;]8th reports a reception given on Shamrock Day by the &quot; Germano-Irish Society &quot; in Berlin.   This &quot; gave rise to a
&apos;&quot; demonstration of a great political nature. The representative of the Foreign Office, &quot;von Sturam, welcomed the Society, and exjsressed the goodwill of the German &quot; Government, which took a lively interest in the fate of Ireland. .... The &quot; assembly sent a telegram of respect to the Kaiser, expressing the hope that, the &quot;German sword would cut the chains of. Ireland.&quot; [See also under &quot;Peace Discussions.&quot;]Nieder-Bamim By-cleebion. Sir YV. Townley reports that the result of the Nieder-Barnim. by-election was a Socialist victory. The Majority Socialist candidate, Wessell, polled 28,4-30 votes, whilst Breitscheid, representing the Minority Socialists, obtained only 18,640. The other three candidates secured 15,300 between them. Vorwarbs describes this as a crushing defeat for tiro Independents, and says : &quot; Nieder-4i Barnim has shown that the policy followed, by Social Democracy during the war &quot; meets with the approval of the masses. They understand that one may be at the &quot; same time opponents, on principle, of war, and yet refuse to hand over one&apos;s &quot; country defenceless to the domination of an invading enemy. The Independent &quot; Socialists accused us of betraying old principles, but the masses have pronounced. &quot; judgment against them.&quot; German Wireless of March .15th states that a final ballot between the two Socialist parties will be necessary, and quotes the Vossische Zeitung as expressing certainty of a Majority triumph: &quot;The working classes have, &quot; by their voting, again strongly avowed themselves in favour of the policy of &quot; August 4th, 19.14, and have encouraged the Government as well as the Reichstag &quot; Majority to continue full of confidence on the road of internal reform as &apos;&quot; heretofore.&quot;The Intelligence Bureau reports :- Herman Socialists and Annexation.-1-&quot; The Majority Socialists profess, to view the fa-its aecomplis with sorrowful resignation. Their organs call attention to the obvious fact that &apos; it is immensely difficult for the Socialist Party in a victorious State to realise their ideal demands,&apos; and they add, &apos; The peace wdth Russia did not turn out as we expected it.&apos; The attention of the Socialist and Labour parties in the countries of the Western Allies might well be devoted to the complete failure of the German Socialist opposition to a policy of conquest, territorial and. economic annexation, and boundless Imperial ambition in the East. The suggestion made at the Interallied Socialist Congress in Paris and London that international representatives of Labour should take part in the eventual Peace Conference has instructive light thrown upon it by the way in which the German Social Democrats are already lecturing their &quot;comrades&apos; of the Allied countries. Two subjects are from the outset ruled out. No German Government which entertained concessions with regard to Alsace-Lorraine could live for 24 hours ; and the Central Powers would. &apos; simply laugh &apos; at any suggestion that the A ustro-Hungarian Empire should be dissolved and that Czechs, Slovaks, and Jugo-Slavs should form a &apos; free Union of Danubian States.&apos; The Socialists of the Allied countries are invited to consider whether it would not be better to abandon &apos; ideal demands &apos; and to resign themselves to the conviction that &apos; a great part of the Socialistic work which is to contribute to a lasting peace will be achieved after the conclusion of that peace.&apos; In the meantime they are warned that the programme of the Interallied Socialists may become a danger to peace, as the statesmen of the Allies may be inclined to consider it as &apos; a kind of popular minimum programme.&apos; It would, therefore, from the German Socialist point of view, be an advantage if the Interallied Socialists would declare that &apos; their conditions have only a relative value.&apos;&quot; Another section of the German, working classes those who belong to the so-called Christian Trade Unions, Catholic and Protestant, is adjuring international Labour to keep off questions of international politics altogether and, if it holds Conferences, to concern itself solely with Labour questions. Here the German Government is to take the. lead. It &apos; has already taken in hand the international adjustment of social policy,&apos; says Giesbert, the President of the Christian Trade Union of Metal Workers and Centre Deputy in the Reichstag for Essen, &quot; and a similar line can be followed in peace treaties.&apos; He adds: &apos; If the International &apos; Congress (of Labour) gives its attention to social policy, that would certainly be &apos; more fruitful, and its prospects would be better than if it were to work for the &apos; weakening of Germain-.&apos; &quot;
Sir W. Townley reports, however, that Herr Herman Weudel, a prominent Majority Socialist, writing in the Frankfort Volhstimme recently, reminded his readers that in 1870, after the battle of Sedan, when the annexationist intentions of the Gorman Government became clear, the two Socialist Reichstag Parties refused to vote further war credits. The time has now come, in his opinion, for the Majority Socialists of to-day to follow this example. They have continued during past years patiently to vote war credits demanded - by Government, hoping thereby to promote a sort of peace to which Socialists could agree. Put they have, he declares, been completely deceived. &quot; The latest events &quot; show that Socialist peace policy has met with complete catastrophe. That which &quot;remains of all the fine words about peace by understanding, right of self-&quot; determination, disarmament and a league of nations is so much sound and smoke. &quot; We wanted peace by understanding, a peace which would last. Instead of this we &quot; have peace reposing upon force which means only a truce to be followed by &quot; renewed armament. The policy of force has triumphed and we stand by a heap &quot; of ruins. The July peace resolution is a worthless scrap of paper. Must we vote &quot; war credits so that, for example, German regiments may (intervene in Russia?) &quot; and in Finland and beat down revolution? A glorious task! Must we sell our &quot; honour, our soul in the future for such a mess of pottage ? No one who values &quot; Socialism can stand it longer. The Party can no longer indulge in this war policy. &quot; It must no longer vote war credits.&quot;Strength of Reichstag Parties. The Pheinisch-Westfdlische Zeitung (March 14th) quotes the statistics issued by the Reichstag Bureau, giving the numerical position of the Reichstag parties on March 8th. ^The figures are : -Centre Party, 88 ; Socialists. 84 ; Progressive Peoples&apos; Party (to which the President of the Reichstag, Dr. Karnpf belongs), -1-6; National Liberals, 45; the Conservatives, 44; German fraction,&apos; 27 ; the Independent Socialists, 25; the Poles, 18. Sixteen members belong to no Party, and some constituencies are still vacant-Mr. Muller reports : Birth Pate. &quot; Fresh evidence of the falling birth-rate in Germany is provided in some information communicated by the Prussian Government to a Committee of the Diet to the effect that the decline in births during the war exceeds the number of men killed in the field, and that the birth-rate cannot be expected after the&apos; war to reach the former level.&quot;Clothing and Textiles. &quot; The extreme need for economy in clothing and clothing materials, even in the army, is the subject of a recently captured Army Order signed by Ludendorff, in which the army is informed that the stocks of raw materials coming from abroad are practically exhausted, and that the consumption, of cloth, linen,&apos; cotton, and all other materials employed in the manufacture of uniforms and equipment must be considerably reduced, as any failure to observe strict economy in their use may easily produce very serious results for the conduct of the war.&quot;Agriculture. &quot;The lack of farm hands is even greater this year than last; there is a constant leakage of agricultural labourers into the munitions industry, and the military authorities are far more chary about giving leave to the farmers and labourers. There is also a great dearth of craftsmen, machinists, &amp;c. The prisoners of war are said to be getting mere and more unsatisfactory as the war goes on, and their strength diminishes under the influence of the prolonged course of underfeeding. Our informant calculates that, taking all sources into consideration, agriculture cannot command more than 40 to 50 per cent, of the male labour normally required. The lack of draught animals is another of the increasing obstacles to successful agriculture. Requisitioning of horses by the military still continues, and even without that the farmers are often tempted to part with their horses by the fabulous prices offered, but the reduction has in a certain measure been counterbalanced by increased breeding and by importation on a large scale from Holland, Denmark, and Sweden. Still, the young, underfed horses cannot work properly, and there is no doubt that the lack of. farm horses will contribute to a diminished return from the land.&quot;Food Supply. &quot; There is no sign, of any cessation of the open evasion of the food laws or of the flagrant dealing in controlled foodstuffs at illegal prices, which enables
privileged classes to exceed tlieir rations and live in comparative comfort at the expense of their less favoured neighbours. All idea of obeying the law, so far as the distribution of food is concerned, has been abandoned, and the breakdown of public moral in Germany on this point is one of the most striking features of the economic war. Visitors to Germany all remark on this spread of lawlessness, and, as one observer puts it, &apos; in order to support life, both rich and poor steal and swindle, and the authorities dare not enforce the law.&apos; Fresh instances of official disregard of the food regulations similar to those revealed in the bieukblln memorandum, have come to light, and wholesale illegalities of every kind bribery, theft, boarding, profiteering, forgery of food tickets, and sale of worthless or noxious food substitutes continue to flourish in spite of public protest. The Food Minister has issued official warnings on the subject, and has threatened all persons, whether private individuals or public bodies, guilty of infringing the food regulations with the full penalties of the law, but things have been allowed to go too far for his words to have any deterrent effect, and the abuses will continue so long as the food shortage prevails and rich people have the means at their disposal to satisfy their seilish requirements. In regard to individual foodstuffs we find that the bread ration is still maintained at its former level, though there are complaints of its inferior nutritive quality as compared with last year, and there are even hints that a further reduction in the flour ration may become necessary in the spring unless sufficient supplies of grain are forthcoming from the Ukraine to prevent such a catastrophe. The fodder shortage grows-worse and worse. Oats&apos;are so scarce as to cause anxiety as to the supply of the necessary amount for seed purposes, and even brewing barley has had to be diverted from the production of beer to the feeding of the army horses, so much so that the breweries may have temporarily to suspend operations. Beer therefore continues to decline both in quantity and quality.&quot;   (And see under &quot; Enemy Allied Affairs.&quot;)Germany and the Economic Offensive. DrfE. Uetrecht, of Berlin, writing in the Taglische Rnndseh-au of March 11th, recalls the frequent threat of Entente statesmen to use the &quot; weapon of raw material,&quot; and thereby to destroy German textile and other industries. He emphasises the dependence of German industries (especially textile) upon imports, and points out that the raw materials are now controlled by Great Britain and the United States of America, who will certainly hinder or prevent their export to Germany for years. &quot; Thus Germany must regard the economic war as lost,&quot; and must therefore penetrate economically the Balkans, the Black Sea countries, Caucasus, Transcaspian Persia, and Siberia. The Central Powers Germany in particular must&quot;create their own fields for raw materials. &quot; Why should not Germany erect a &apos; Paw Material Trust&apos; in opposition to the Angio-&quot; American ? Capital could not be better spent. We must make ourselves &quot; independent of Oversea imports. We must count on economic war as a fait &quot; accompli, and. make use of our time.&quot; Sir W. Townley reports a speech made by Sydow, Minister of Commerce, in the Prussian House of Deputies on March 13th. He declared that the war was made economically necessary for Germany by the &quot;encircling&quot; policy of the Entente, and that from the first it had been conducted by England in. a manner to destroy German trade and industry. He alluded to the Non-ferrous Metals Act, and to the Anglo-American demand for the return (on selfish economic grounds) of Alsace-Lorraine to France. In conclusion, lie said that if Germany was ever to recover, peace must give her security from every point of view especial!)&apos; in the matter of raw materials. The economic war aims were at least as important as the general war aims. The most important thing for Germany was the supply of raw materials, and the guaranteeing of an outlet for her manufactures. It was important that the working classes should recognise this as affecting their own interests. German AVireless of March 18th reports a speech on similar mines by Dr. Helfferieh, the former Vice-Chancellor. (See also Report No. 59 under &quot;Allied Affairs.&quot;) An article by &quot; a pan-German industrialist &quot; in the Berliner Tageblatt of March 18th suggests that the only way out of the vicious circle of this war is an economic understanding based on interchange of capital by England and G ermany.Army Contracts. -According to a Berlin telegram (March 15th) the Alain Committee of the Reichstag again discussed the question of Army contracts in connection with the affairs of the Daimler works. (See Report No. 59.) Motions were adopted unanimously requesting the Government to control the books, &amp;c, of Army contractors, and to establish a Central Board of Control to examine local control5257-3!. &apos; C
boards.   A. motion &quot;was rejected requesting the  militarisation of Army and Navy contracting works and the fixing of prices, allowing the payment of 5 per cent, interest on invested capital.NETHERLANDS.German Opinion on Allied Employment of Dutch Tonnage. ddie German Press professes great indignation, at the Allied note to the Dutch Government (see under &quot;Shipping Situation&quot;). Some papers express pity for Holland, comparing her treatment with that of Greece ; others express confidence in her pride and honour; the majority openly threaten intense submarine warfare and the refusal of supplies. . The desperate plight of .Allied transport is duly emphasized, and (according to German Wireless) vorwarts goes so far as to suggest the ulterior motive of the Allies to be the elimination of Dutch tonnage from post-war competition.The Intelligence Bureau reports : Food Scandals. &quot; Various scandals regarding food distribution are engaging public attention in Holland, and one at least has been discussed in the Second Chamber.&apos; The case is very briefly as follows. Mr. de Jong, a member of the Cabinet, had for some time been under an accusation of having used, his position at the Ministry of Agriculture to favour certain private interests. He at first managed to clear his character to the satisfaction of his fellow members of the Liberal Union, who investigated the charges and. declared them to be unfounded. Put the matter did not rest there. Publication of the Report of the Liberal Union Avas demanded and was finally conceded. It was then discovered that although his Party only found him guilty of imprudence the accusations involved more serious conclusions. Mr. de Jong has announced that he would not again stand, for Parliament, and the incident has led to attacks in the Press on more influential persons, such as Mr. Kroller, the pro-German &quot;uncrowned King of Holland,&quot; who is vigorously denounced in the Telegraaf for spreading the spirit of corruption through the country.&quot;Embargoes raised. The Foreign Office informs Sir W. Townley that the specific embargoes on flower seeds and furs for Holland have been raised.SWITZERLAND.b:bVL&apos;/liritish and United States Exchange, Sir Id. Rumbold reports that offers for British and American notes have risen with increasing rapidity since the beginning of March. It is riossible that these notes are being acquired by the enemy for payment of agents or for strengthening the Austrian Bank reserves ; it is also possible that the Turks are converting their German money into British and American. Until the purchasers and. their object are ascertained, Sir II. Rumbold suggests that the exportation of British and American notes to Switzerland should be restricted.Wheat Supply. -The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading that the Swiss Government has requested that an additional 30,000 tons of grain may be supplied during the present month by the Wheat Export Company. His Majesty&apos;s Government hopes that this request can be met. Zurich papers (March 16th) &quot;state that the Swiss public is watching with the keenest interest the progress of the negotiations between the Entente and Holland on. the shipping question, ddie pro-German Zurich Post (March 16th) remarks that Switzerland has special interest in the-matter, as only the fulfilment of the Entente&apos;s wishes can. ensure the transport of corn from. America to Switzerland.Nickel. A. temporary embargo has been placed on the export of nickel into Switzerland, owing to the discovery that a member of the German Legation at Berne has recently been purchasing this metal.NORWAY, ddie Intelligence Bureau reports : Economic Conditions. ddie conditions in Norway at the opening of the New Year, the enormous difficulty of shipping, the prevailing scarcity of raw material, the threatening scarcity of food, and the slender success of some recent emissions have had a marked effect on the business life of the country.   It has been found that in
the past two years too many banks have sprung up, and the older banks have increased, their subscriptions. The Government has consequently put forward a proposal to stop such developments, unless sanction is first obtained, fearing a general crash should bad times come later on.Mobilisation of Agricultural Labour. Sir M. Findlay reports that under a Bill, about to be submitted to the Storthing, all able-bodied persons between 15 and 65 years of age are to be mobilised for agricultural labour or for replacing other persons diverted to agriculture from other employments. Provision is also made for the closing of factories or the limitation, during spring and autumn, of their output in cases where they hold back labour from the land and are not indispensable to national economy. It would thus appear that factories working for the Allies may be affected.Norwegian Commercial Negotiations. Sir M. Find lay reports that the Norwegian Foreign Minister, speaking in the Storthing, announced that in the negotiations with America there were now only a few formal points awaiting settlement. No agreement had yet been signed. A commercial agreement was also being negotiated, with Germany, under which it was hoped to assure the importation or certain important commodities. ^i&apos;he Intelligence Bureau reportsNorwegian Shipping. &quot; At the beginning of the war in 1014 Norwegian tonnage amounted to 2,(349,000 tons, but at the end. of 1917 it had shrunk to about 1,930,000 tons, being a decrease of 450,000 tons in steamships and 220,000 tons in sailing ships, due chiefly to the activity of enemy submarines. Nevertheless the shipowners have become very rich because the value of freights has sprung up from 210 million kroner in 1914 to 1,063 million kroner in 1916. Norwegian shipowners, through purchase of foreign vessels and contracts for new boats in the United States, have done their best to maintain their fleet during the war, but now, owing to the impossibility of purchasing new ships, they have become powerless onlookers at the rapid destruction of: their property, with no opportunity of renewing the same in the near future. If the losses sustained by the Norwegian fleet during the war, say about 1,500,000 tons dead weight, are calculated at the recent current prices, they amount to the huge sum of 90,000,000/., in addition to which about 1,000 Norwegian seamen have lost their lives. In consequence of these heavy losses numerous officers and sailors are unemployed. The losses for February are reported as being 16,200 gross tonnage and 39 seamen killed or missing.&quot;The Intelligence Bureau reports : Narvik- and Spitsbergen......-It is stated, in   the London  Press that among the supplementary claims against Russia put forward by Germany is that of &quot;permission to exploit Spitsbergen,&quot; which has very valuable and easily worked coalfields. This group of islands was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553. In recent times it has been a &quot;No Maids Land.&quot; Russia had a shadowy-claim which was never exercised, and Norway also had a claim, on the ground that the workmen on the island, were exclusively Norwegian and required some protection. A. conference took place on the matter in Christiana in 1903. There were recently two English mining companies there which came to grief, and their interests were absorbed by an American company, which was developed on. a considerable scale, and is reported to have done well financially, and is putting out a considerable amount of coal. Narvik, near the Murinan Coast, is an ice-free port, is within, moderate steaming distance (460 miles) of the Spitsbergen coalfields, and. is a port of call for ships carrying iron ore from the Syd. Yaranger and Dunderland fields further north. It might therefore in the future have from the commercial and tactical standpoint a very considerable importance. With the port of Narvik on the mainland in German hands, the iron-ore fields of Syd Varanger and Dunderland (an English company) -would be entirely controlled, and also to a considerable extent the whole of the Murman Coast. In the Kdlnische Zeitung a Professor HiltebraucP recently wrote: &quot;Norway is so rich in &quot; ports that it can easily spare Narvik, and on the side of Germany no particular *&apos; consideration need be shown to Norway, who all through the war lias placed herself &quot; at the disposal of England.&quot;   [See also under &quot; Finland.&quot;)
The lutoll igence Bureau reports : Bolshevism. In a paper called Klasse Kampen (class-war) the editor, Eugene Claussen, welcomes the new Bolshevist movement among the workmen. The most advanced Socialism has generally been found in the north, among the fishing population. To a considerable extent this is due to hostile propaganda, because unknown donors have recently sent some 3.000/-. tb Trondhjem for the use of the &quot; extreme Socialists.&quot; It is likewise reported that, attempts are being made to create trouble in the munitions factory at Raufos. Some 40 Russian Bolshevists have been expelled from Norway as undesirable. Among them is Angelica Balabanolf, who was travelling as special messenger of M. Vorovsky, the representative in Stockholm of the Russian Bolshevists.Gorman. Propaganda. The Intelligence Bureau observes that although it might be expected that Norway would be a favourable field for British propaganda, it is found in practice extremely difficult to make any headway in the face of the stories issued by the Germans.And see under &quot; Finland.&quot;SWEDEN.Swedish Negotiations with. Allies. Sir E. Howard reports that the Conservative Party and Press and a number of commercial Unions are attacking the proposed Agreement (see Reports Nos. 08 and 59) as involving the concession of 500,000 tons of shipping in return for mere promises, an act almost unneutral and now, in view of the Ukraine Treaty, unnecessary. The Foreign Office instructs Sir E,. Howard to inform the Swedish Government that iu view of the conclusion of charters for 43,000 tons deadweight out of .1.00,000 tons, the shipment to Sweden of 10,000 tons of phosphate, out of the 25,000 con temp iated in the Agreement, may now be made. Vessels should be sent from Sweden for this purpose, or if vessels now in United States ports are used, they should be replaced from Sweden by corresponding tonnage. The Wheat Executive has guaranteed facilities for purchase by Sweden subject to conclusion of the Agreement of 100,000 tons of wheat, 50,000 tons of oats, and 100,000 tons of maize, to be shipped by the Swedish Government from the Argentine, the wheat in April, and May, the oats and maize later; also 100,000 tons of wheat or 80,000 tons of wheat flour from Australia, Facilities are also promised for the purchase of rice from. Rangoon or the Dutch,Indies. The above quantities are to be regarded as part of the rations specified, in the draft Agreement. Steps are being taken to acquaint the Swedish, public with the practical advantages of the Allied proposals. The prospect, of increase in tonnage at Allied disposal, and of a decrease in Swedish exports to Germany, continues to evoke violent threats ijom the German Government against Sweden,And see under &quot; Finland.&quot;DENMARK.Denmark and Submarine Campaign. Sir R, Paget reports the torpedoing by a German submarine of the Danish S.S. Randelsborg outside the danger zone and contrary to agreement made with the German Government. - Failing a satisfactory explanation by the German Government, the exportation of horses to Germany (under the terms of the Agreement) will be discontinued.German-Danish Negotiations. Mr. Gurney reports that negotiations in regard to exchange of commodities, for the months April, to July inclusive, between Germany and Denmark are imminent.Embargo on Vegetables. The Foreign Office informs Sir R. Paget. that an embargo has been placed upon all vegetables and vegetable seeds for Denmark. And see under &quot; Shipping Situation.&quot;FINLAND (and ALAND).Finnish Ambassador to Berlin. German Wireless of March 15th reports that. Diplomatic   relations   between . the   Gorman   Empire   and:  Finland   have   been &quot; resumed, and the Finnish Embassy has been installed in Berlin under the leadership &quot; of State Councillor Dr. Hjelt, who has commenced his activities.&quot;
German Motives. With, regard to the motives actuating German action in Finland (see Report No. 59 under &quot;Finland&quot;), Sir E. Howard points out that one of. the principal would appear to be the acquisition of the Murman- coast, involving the severance of Russia from any ice-free port, the interruption of Allied communication with the northern ports of Russia, and a menace to ,the British flank in the North Sea-. The occupation of Kola by the Germans might easily lead to the control by them of the whole of the coast of Northern Scandinavia, including the port of Narvik (and see under &quot;Norway&quot;). Nya DagligtAU.eh.anda, of March 18th published an article urging that Sweden should effectively support Finland&apos;8 demand for Russian Karelia and the Kola Peninsula, demanding in return the Aland Islands and districts of Norrbottens Lan adjoining the Swedish frontier as far as Tornea and Munio Rivers, which Sweden ceded to Russia in 1809.Finland, and, German Control. Petrograd papers (March J 6th) [report landings of Germans in Finland, the points of disembarkation including Hangoe and some places on the Gulf of Bothnia. Stockholm papers (March 17th) state that telegraphic eomnm-communication .between Sweden and Helsingfors and the rest of Southern Finland was suddenly interrupted on the evening of March 16th. The break is situated between Sweden, and Mariehanm. It is probable that the line has been cut by the Germans in the Aland Islands. Sir E. Howard learns that in view of a considerable reinforcement, especially in artillery, of the Red Forces, the Germans are deferring their advance against Abo. Mr. Grove reports the statement of a member of the Finnish Government at Helsingfors that Finland, is not bound by agreements made by four Senators at Wasa while Parliament is not sitting. Mr. Woodhouse reports that the Representative of the Finnish Senate at Petrograd has shown him a protest (telegraphed to various countries) against the invasion and control of Finland by Germany. Mr. Grove submits that if the Allies will give the Finnish Government an assurance of food supplies, it will refrain from binding itself to Germany. Sir E. Howard suggests that foodstuffs and goods in transit through Sweden might be released in return for goods (especially metals) now in Finland, certain British vessels in Finnish waters, and the reservation (for Allied use after the war; of a quantity of timber. Meanwhile, according to Stockholm papers (March 16th), the Finnish. Food Committee has rationed butter with the intention of exporting the country&apos;s surplus to Germany in exchange for corn.The Intelligence Bureau reports : Attitude of Swedish Conservatives. ddie crushing of Bolshevism in Finland, which after German intervention has actually taken place is a mere matter of time, may irritate the advanced parties in Sweden, and in the universal, ferment caused by -the war and the increasingly precarious food situation may lead to a serious condition of affairs, the ultimate effects of which it is impossible to foresee. The classes which, are pro-German in Sweden are the nobility, bureaucracy, and the officer corps. It must be remembered that there is an extreme element, hitherto small, in Sweden which differs little, if at all, from the Anarchists in Russia, Finland, and elsewhere. It is not altogether unnatural that the Conservative classes, with recent object lessons at their very doors, regard the possible advent of Bolshevism in Sweden with growing apprehension. They look upon Germany as representing order and a stable condition of society. It is not only in Sweden that this has been the case from the outbreak of war. It is a common, thing to hear moderate, sensible, and by no means unfriendly swiss, Spaniards, and Scandinavians say that the Entente is deliberately encouraging the unruly elements in all countries to break out and destroy religion, order, and indeed all that makes life worth living. -Aland. A Swedish official communique of March 15th announces the withdrawal from the Aland Islands of the Swedish expedition on completion of its humanitarian task. Two hundred and fifty men of the Russian Garrison, chiefly Poles, Ukrainians, Letts and Esthonians, have been conveyed to Sweden, and will later be transported to their homes. A larger contingent of Russians has been taken to Li ban. A Swedish Military Commissary will remain with a small detachment to protect Russian property under the terms of the Agreement. Sweden reserves her rights in regard to the settlement of political questions concerning Aland. As the German Government has declared against the fortification of the Islands, the Swedish Government asks that the existing defences may be at once destroyed under the supervision of the Swedish and Finnish authorities, the Germans and Russians assisting if they think fit to do so. The Swedish Government is taking steps to ascertain whether the Entente Powers
offer any objection to the course they propose to take. A Berlin, telegram to Stock-holms Ticlning states that under Article 0 of the Russo-German Treaty endeavour is to be made to secure agreement between German)-, Finland, Russia and Sweden, regarding the Aland Islands ; according to which the islands shall remain fortified, and their treatment from the military point of view and their equipment for purposes of shipping will be regulated. Finally, Germany and other Baltic States are em-powered to conclude such an agreement.Seizure by Germans of Allied Subjects at Aland.- Sir E. Howard reports that two -parties of British subjects travelling from Abo to Sweden have been captured by the Germans at Aland. Of these, 1.2 men, including A^ice-Consul Fawcett, have been sent to Dantzig, as also lias an American who accompanied them. The British and United States Governments have made vigorous representations to the. Finnish Govern-in ent, requiring it to protest at Berlin against the violation of Finnish neutrality ; failing which the Allied Governments may find, themselves constrained to regard Finland as an enemy and an ally of Germany. Sir E. Howard reports that the Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires at Stockholm has expressed regret at the incident, but has declared that the Germans quote as a precedent the treatment by the Allies of German and Austrian subjects in Greece.Allied Representatives. Sir E. Howard reports that efforts are being made to induce General Afannerheim to assent to an armistice, with a view to facilitating the passage of those Allied Missions which are still detained at Tammerfors. The Finnish Government, with the assent of the German Government, has guaranteed the immunity of Allied Consuls in Finland during the presence there of German troops.SPAIN.Resignation of Cabinet. According to a Press report, the Spanish Cabinet has again resigned.Strike of Post and Telegraph Officials. The Foreign Office learns that a Post, Office strike is in progress in Spain. The telegraph and postal services have been put under military control. According to Press reports, the trouble is connected with the Junta movement.British Exchange. Sir A. Hardinge learns That the Credito IVfercantil is offering to sell pounds sterling in large amounts at 19 pesetas. Similar offers are being made by various Barcelona banks.   The motive of these transactions is not yet clear.German Propaganda. German Wireless of Alarch 16th reports :  &quot; The celebrated, actor Alexander Moissi read &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; by Cervantes, befor a crowded room in the Berlin Academy.   The public followed the genial reading with deep interest.&quot;   .   .   .   &quot; Writing in tlie Norddeutsche Altgemeine Zeitung, Dr. Otto Gran to IT appeals for the formation of a German institution in Spain such as would, be appropriate for promoting and uniting German-Spanish culture and interests in art..   He says that a profound study of Spanish art by the artists of the present day in Germany would be of especial value.&quot; ,CHINA.China and Japan. Sir C. Greene reports that it is improbable that Japan will offer to mediate between the North and South in China (see Report No. 59). The recent success of the Northern armies has strengthened the Peking Government, and a rapprochement with the South has become possible. In any case the Northern Govern-ment will co-operate with Japan, in the event of Japanese intervention in Siberia.Citing Using Mines. In view of representations by the Japanese Government that a. Japanese merchant named Yoshida had, prior to the war, entered into negotiations for the purchase of the Ohing Hsing Alines from their Director and&quot; principal shareholder von Hanneken, the Foreign Office has authorised Sir JA Jordan to withdraw official support from his competitors, the Italian Administration and the Peking Syndicate. Sir J. Jordan is instructed to point out the undesirability of any payment being made to von Hanneken during the continuance of the war.
siAxr.Exports of Rice to Java. Sir H. Bering learns that the Netherlands Government is enquiring whether and on what conditions the shipment of rice from Siam to Java will be permitted. The Foreign Office instructs him that these are dependent on the result of negotiations now in progress with the Netherlands Government.ARGENTINA.Coal. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared.to supply the Argentine with British coal for the next four months if the ships which take out coal are allowed to bring back produce ; but the coal will not be available on any other terms. This arrangement gives a reasonable security that the British share of Argentine produce will be forthcoming.BRAZIL.Censorship. The Foreign Office advises Lord Reading of the desirability of Allied co-operation in the Brazilian postal censorship.   (See Report No. 55.)MEXICO.Carranza and Foreign Interests. Mr. Cummins learns that there is a prospect that, in order to assure itself of funds, the Mexican Government may seize the most important mines in the Republic. The Government is growing weaker, and the possibility of a successful revolution must not be excluded. Sir W. Townley reports that the Netherlands Government has instructed its Minister at Washington to concert with the British and United States Governments against any measures of the Mexican Government which may be prejudicial to Dutch interests. Mr. Cummins earns that the Government forces are being gradually withdrawn from the oilfields.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Appropriation Bill. Lord Beading reports the probable enaction iu the immediate future of an. Appropriation Bill empowering the President, to acquire title to docks (including their establishments and facilities) belonging to the German Lloyd and Ham burg-American Companies. By an additional section the Trading with, the Enemy Act is amended by the enabling of the Custodian of Alien Property to exercise the powers of a common law trustee over all such enemy property other than money, and to dispose of it by sale or otherwise as if he were absolute owner. These powers will be drastically applied in the case of the American Metal Company and similar concerns partially owned by persons residing in enemy con ntries.SHIPPING SITUATION.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the king&apos;s enemies during the period March 8th - 14th inclusive, was 07,133 tons gross, of which 34,491 were British, as compared with 63,102 tons gross, of which 39,187 were British, reported last week. The Admiralty reports that 121 British, Allied and Neutral, merchant vessels (including British fishing vessels) were sunk in February 1918, as compared with 128 in January. This is the lowest figure for any month since the unrestricted warfare commenced. The total tonnage lost, however, was 311,006 for February, as compared with 295,803 in January. A general statement regarding losses and construction was made by the First Lord of the Admiralty in the House of Commons on March 20th, and reproduced in the Bress of March 21st. Further reference will be made to the subject in next week&apos;s Report.Convoy System, Of 6,368 ships (44,024,200 dead, weight capacity) convoyed, (homewards arid outwards) up to March 2nd, the loss in ships was 1&apos; 12, and in dead weight capacity 1&apos; 16.
Danish-American Negotiations. In reply to tlie stipulations made by tlie United States War Trade Board (see Report No. 57), the Banish Government observes that it would no doubt be possible to arrange for the prolongation of the Agreement beyond the period of six months at present limited. With regard to the United States demand that the Banish vessels chartered should be employed in the danger zone, the Banish Government observes that such a concession would prejudice the position of other neutral Governments. The terms of the Danish note contemplate the possibility that the United States Government will requisition the ships ; the Danish Government considers that this would be contrary to international law, and suggests that the British Government acknowledged this by counting requisitioned vessels among those which were afterwards voluntarily ceded. The Foreign Office learns that in these circumstances the United States War Trade Board is considering the alternative of voyage charters direct from Danish shipowners, with provision for an option of continual renewal.Dutch Shipping. In reply to the Allied proposals for utilisation of Dutch tonnage in British and United States ports (see Report No. 59), the Netherlands Government, after applying without success to Germany for the provision of 100,000 tons of wheat for delivery over two months, has informed His Majesty&apos;s Government as follows. It withdraws its objection to the employment of such vessels in the danger zone on the understanding that they will transport neither troops nor war supplies, and that they will not be armed. The crews are to be free to decline navigating in the danger zone; and the Allied Governments are to be considered pledged to replace all destroyed ships immediately after the war : the above offer to be conditional upon, rationing and tonnage concessions as proposed in the course of the negotiations in London, and upon .100,000 tons of wheat to be placed at Dutch disposal in American . ports by mid-April, and a further,^00,000 later on. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir W. Townley that tlie stipulations that the ships should, not be armed or used for troops or war supplies are unacceptable. Meanwhile, the German Bress, in threatening and apparently inspired articles, observes that Holland is giving not one finger but her whole hand to the Entente, and German propaganda in Scandinavia is making the most of the matter. The Dutch Bress of March 19th announces an offer by the German Government to allow free passage immediately to 15,000 tons of Dutch shipping from Dutch harbours, provided Dutch shipping in harbours outside Europe is put in motion, such exchange to take place on a basis of mutual &quot; final clearance.&quot; In the circumstances the British and United States Governments have notified the Netherlands Government of their intention to requisition. It is exidained that this course is adopted with reluctance, but in accordance with uncpiestionable right. Liberal terms are specified, to which further reference will, be made in next week&apos;s Report.Belgian Relief Siiip seized by Germans  Stockholm papers (March 16th) state :   &quot; Tlie Swedish steamer Drincessen Ingelborg, &quot;which had been conveying maize to &quot; Rotterdam from La Plata for the Belgian Relief Commission, left Rotterdam in &quot;ballast on the.9th instant for Gothenburg with a German permit. Yesterday &quot; evening the owners received a telegram that the ship had been taken into Kiel. &quot; The seizure of the vessel is in direct violation of the agreement with. Germany &quot; regarding the feeding of Belgians.&quot;PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. The most important incident of the week has been the denunciation published by the Entente Alliance of the &quot; peace &quot; treaties forced by Germany upon nations which have entered into negotiations with her. Lord Bertie on March 19th forwarded extracts showing the favourable reception of the London Declaration in the French Press.Sir R. Rodd on March 16th reported that rumours about peace negotiations were being spread in all countries of the Entente Alliance. These are looked upon by the Italian Government to be initiated by the Germans with a view to enervating the spirit of the public at the same time that they are massing their forces in the West.Sir E. Howard on March 20th sent a Press report, emanating from Berlin, that the peace treaty with Russia contained an article making provision for endeavours to secure agreement between Germany, Finland, Russia, and Sweden that the Aland
Islands should-remain fortified, and that their treatment from a military point&quot; of -view and equipment for shipping purposes shall be &quot;regulated.&quot;Russia. On March 15th Mr. Wardrop reported that the Moscow Congress met at 5 p.in. on the previous day and included 1,084 delegates, the Bolshevists having an overwhelming majority. On March 16th he reported that the Peace Treaty with the Central Powers was ratified by a show of hands.&apos; Lenin, spoke last, and used argument that he had the support of nine out of ten of his party. The chief speeches in opposition came from Anarchists, ddie Social Revolutionaries left, refusing to share in the responsibility for ratification of the Treaty.The substance of Mr. BalfouFs speech in the House of Commons on March 1.4th on the Bolshevist peace was communicated to Mr. Lockhart on March 17th. Mr. Lockhart on March 18th reported that, although the &quot; peace &quot; had been ratified by the Moscow congress, preparations for war were being pushed forward.Finland. Sir E. Howard, on. March 15th reported, from reliable information obtained in Stockholm, that a strong pro-German was sent to Germany to sign the peace treaty, and that he allowed the Germans to append conditions affecting economics and other matters. The treaty requires ratification by the Diet and might not become operative.Courland. German Wireless of March. 16th contains descriptions of the reception by Count Hertling of the deputation sent from Courland to ask the Kaiser to accept the ducal crown. The deputation expressed the hope that &quot;Baltic territories &quot; could be united in a Federal Union &quot; permanently connected with the German Empire.&quot; The &quot;All-Highest&quot; promised to communicate his answer to the Diet, after consulting authorities commanded to place their views before him.Sir W. Townley on March 17th forwarded an extract from an article in Vossische of March I6th saying that the Reichstag or the Prussian Landtag will have to ask. for the guarantees offered by the deputation that their request represents the lasting desire of an overwhelming majority of the population.German Wireless of March 18th quotes an article in Germania trying to establish that the principle of self-determination is being applied by Germany to Courland.Lithuania.

Baron von dem Bussche also spoke.German Wireless of March 18th quoted from, a speech by IIerr Helfferich, accusing Great Britain of imperialistic war aims, and ending with a programme of a &quot; German economic peace &quot; which amounts to a demand that, Germany shall suffer no economic disadvantages in sea trade.German Wireless of the same date, in a manifesto on the reception given by the German-Irish. Society in Berlin, quotes from a speech the words &quot;The freedom of the &quot; seas would only be assured when a free Ireland, is made the watcher of the Atlantic Ocean.&quot;Sir W.

On March 14th Sir Id. Rumbold reported on good Turkish authority that German prestige has been very much increased amongst her Allies by the &quot;peace&quot; made with Russia, but, now that there is no longer any Russian menace, it is thought in Constantinople to be a favourable moment for Turkey to make peace with England and France, especially in view of the Bulgarian menace to Constantinople.France.-Lord Bertie on March 16th drew attention to an article by M. Thomas in Human lie expressing the opinion that the Allies should not despair of the opinion of the German Minority Socialists about the London Socialist Conference resolutions, and that the Allies should &quot; Fasten victory by propaganda.&quot;German Wireless of March 18th is exasperated at M.

The Ministry of Labour, in their report ,for the week ending March 13th, described some belated criticism of the war aims declaration by the London Interallied Socialist Conference. An increase in the hostility displayed by the more extreme papers is the chief point to note.Lord Lansdowne&apos;s second letter is welcomed exuberantly by papers like the Nation,, but seems to have attracted little general attention in Labour and Socialist papers.GENERAL.Air liaicls. The Eoreign Office learns that the allied air raids into Germany are having a considerable effect.
