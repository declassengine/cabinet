SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHKl)  WESTERN  AND GFNF.RALLi IMPORT, No, 51.PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.React, Discussions.United States. Special interest attaches to the wording of President Wilson&apos;s pronouncements on the Freedom of the Seas. The original statement, as reported, would make the North Sea more free to the passage of German Armies than Belgium was in August 191-1, and the security of the British Isles from invasion would depend upon the instant intervention of some sea force under international control, instead of upon the British Navy. Further explanations modify the impression originally conveyed.General. Accounts from all sources indicate the probability of the Bolshevists making a separate peace with the Central Powers, in contravention to the undertaking of. September 5th, 19.14, between Russia, France, and England, which was subscribed 1o subsequently by .Japan on October 19th and by Italy on. November 30lh, 1915. The main result has been the movement, of large masses of German and Austrian troops from the Eastern front, and a vast increase in the strength of their Armies available for use against those of the Entente Alliance. The effect of this improvement in the power of our enemy to conduct offensive operations on. hind is to bo seen in the attitude assumed by the Government officials of various neutral countries, especially Scandinavian, in. conversation with our diplomatic Representatives ; its effect seems also to have been to strengthen for a time the dominance of the military authorities in Germany. Accounts disagree about the immediate results to be expected from the economic and financial, pressure upon the German population, but they agree that these factors will, have their maximum effect between February and May. Information furnished to the War Cabinet shows that the military situation will be more favourable to the Entente Powers in. August. In the meantime, the whole issue depends upon the staunchness of the French, Italian and British Armies, and of the nations behind them, in preventing the Central Powers from gaining the military successes demanded by the internal situation in Germany and Allied countries. Information received since this report was compiled indicates an, increase in the influence of Bolshevist propaganda in Germany, and there are rumours of fresh naval mutinies at Kiel and Wilhehushaven. Latest reports from France express a doubt whether there would be universal support for a continuation of the war merely to recover Alsace-Lorraine. The question of Bolshevist propaganda in this country is being considered by the War Cabinet.

PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.ALLIED AFFAIRS. .Interallied Council. The Interallied Council, which lias now held five meetings in London and one in Paris, is composed as follows :   xMr. Osoau T. Crosbie, U.S.A. (Chairman).Mr. Austen Chamberlain -hGeneral Smuts - I British.Lord Buokmaster -)M. Clem entel (Commerce)&quot;)M. Loucheur (Munitions) - &apos; French.M. Bignon (Finance)       - )Baron Mayor des Blanche ^Dr. Attolico       - - y Italian.General IVIola      -       -)Mr. Crosbie is advised by an Advisory Council of Americans, headed by Mr. Cravath.Far East. Sir J. Jordan reports that there Is at present an undisciplined body, of 15,000 Bolshevist Reservists in Vladivostock, who are only restrained, by fear of the Cossacks on the North and the Japanese on the South. Sir C. Greene learns that their influence is all powerful amongst the workmen and sailors. A newly arrived Russian officer is, however, endeavouring to demobilise them. The Japanese warship &quot; Iwami &quot; was due to arrive on January 13th, H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; on January 14th, and the U.S. S.S. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was expected at Yokohama on January 11th. Sir C. Greene has been instructed to point out to the Japanese Government that sole action by Japan might arouse general opposition in. Russia, and. that in any case, all appearance of invasion should be avoided. Tire British and United States Consuls at Vladivostock have been authorised to enter into unofficial relations with the ZemstvoS Committee as a temporary administrative institution, and Sir J. Jordan reports that the Committee at Blagovestchensk is prohibiting the transport of goods to westward of that town.   The general situation at Vladivostock is now peaceful.Finland. The Foreign Office is informed that the Danish and Norwegian Governments have recognised the independence of Finland. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Helsingfors has now been instructed to enter into unofficial relations with the Finnish Authorities as representing the de facto Government in Finland. The German wireless Press reports that Deputy Fehrenbach, Chairman of the Reichstag Main Committee, opened, (ho sitting of January 8th with congratulations to Finland on the German recognition, and expressed the &quot;hope and desire that between Finland and the German Empire friendly and lasting relations, especially in economic matters,&quot; might be &quot; entered into and maintained.&quot; Sir E. Howard reports that the larger portion of transit foodstulfs which were released from Sweden for Finnish consumption have been seized and eaten, by Bolshevist troops, and expresses the hope that further foodstuffs will not be imported until exports from Finland to Germany have ceased.Coal Supplies. The Interallied Conference on Coal Distribution is being held in London. Pending definite arrangements it is hoped that the French Government will be able to meet a considerable part of Italian requirements in order to free-corresponding British tonnage for the conveyance of cereals.Cable Embargo. Tire complaint, of American shippers (see Report No. 50) that they are adversely affected by the British embargo on Dutch cables, has elicited an assurance from the Foreign Office of fair and equal treatment for American as for British transactions, and an intimation that, by arrangement with the Netherlands Government, the embargo may shortly be raised.
- - -     FRANCE. &quot; - ; - -Caillaux Case. Sir R. Rodd reports the seizure by the Italian Government of documents stated to be of great importance in connection with the Caillaux case  deposited in the name of Madame Caillaux at a Bank in Florence. Lord Bertie reports that M. Caillaux has been arrested, and that a change is already perceptiblein the attitude of the Radical-Socialists.&apos;i 1&apos;      .......Foreign Policy. On January 11th, the Chamber, after hearing interpellations on Foreign Policy and M. Pichon&apos;s reply, passed an Order of the Day approving the declaration of the Government and relying on them to seek by energetic conduct of the war complete reparation of the abuses of Force, the establishment of a Reign of Justice in International relations and the triumph of Democracy, Priority for this Order was adopted by 377 to 1,13 votes, the minority comprising the entire Socialist group, except three who abstained and 22 Radical-Socialists, amongst whom was M. Palbiez.BELGIUM.Administration.--Sir F. Villiers, in a despatch dated -January 4th, reports the establishment of a Belgian Ministry of National Reorganisation under Baron de Broqueville, who relinquishes the Department of Foreign Affairs in favour of M. Hymans. M. Poullet becomes Minister of Economic Affairs, and M. Brunei; a member of the Cabinet without office.Three Committees of War and Reconstruction are created. The first is to deal with military matters and external relations, and will be composed of the Ministers of National Reconstruction, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Colonies, Civil and Military Supply, War, and Count Gioblet d&apos;Alviella, who is a member of the Cabinet without office.The second is to occupy itself with matters concerning the economic reconstruction of Belgium and compensation for war damages. Its members will be the Ministers of National Reconstruction, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and Public Works, Railways, Marine, Posts and Telegraphs, Industry and Labour, Economic Affairs, and M. Brunei.For the third Committee are reserved questions in regard, to refugees and to legislative and administrative measures required, during the war and afterwards. Upon it will serve the Ministers of National Reconstruction, Justice, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Science and Arts, Industry and Labour, Civil and Military Supply, and Count Goblet d.&apos;A1 vied a.ITALY.Pacifism. Sir R. Rodd, in a despatch dated December 27th, reports that the official Socialist Morgan in the course of a Leninist speech made in the Chamber supported his views by quotations from Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter. Signor Giolitti, whose parlia-mentary manoeuvres have been temporarily defeated (largely through the activity of the Federation of National Defence) and who has &quot;already pronounced against a separate peace for Italy, will now probably work for a general peace, and aim at discrediting the United States as being, like Great Britain, an obstacle to peace and .a future commercial competitor.General. In a despatch dated December 30th, Sir R. Rodd. reports that food supply and distribution continue to cause discontent in Italy and Sicily. The Allied forces, particularly the British, are popular in Turin, Milan and Venice. The position of Giolitti in Turin is still paramount ; but signs of opposition are appearing ami at a crowded meeting on December IGth in favour of civil mobilization he was roundly -abused.   Fear is felt of it strike among the weavers of Milan who are demanding
double wages.   There is a marked improvement in public feeling in Venice, due partly to the removal of disloyal elements arid partly to the increased confidence of the remainder.   The Intelligence Bureau reports that the rounding up of enemy subjects is now being actively undertaken.   By January 11th, 1,500persons had been interned in the&apos;extreme south and 300 expelled from the country.   Measures are also being taken for the sequestration of enemy properties and businesses.   On January 1st the creation of a War Cabinet was announced ; this consists of. the President of the Council, the  Ministers   for   Foreign Affairs, Treasury, War, Marine, Arms and. Munitions, and the Minister of Pensions, Signor Bissolati, whose addition to the Council is regarded as a guarantee for the thorough prosecution of the war.   A re-examination has been ordered of the rejected recruits of the 1874-99 classes (18-43 years of age).. Rationing for sugar, cereals, butter, and coal has now been introduced all over Italy, and a census of grain stocks has been ordered with a view to putting a stop to hoarding.   Mr. Lloyd-George&quot;s speech on Avar aims has been very favourably received,, though certain papers insist that mere recovery of the terra irredenta is not sufficient to secure Italy&apos;s position in the Adriatic.   The organs of the Vatican welcome the British pronouncement as inspired by the same spirit as the Papal note, and reducing Entente aims to a precision which, calls for a reply from the Central Powers.GREECE.Creek Policy. -Lord Granville, in a despatch dated December 17th, reports the publication of a statement by the Greek Foreign Minister, M. Politis, to the Athenai newspaper. M. Politis expressed surprise and disappointment at the indifference displayed by the people in regard to the persecution of the Greeks by the Turks and Bulgarians. He added that the Government was shortly going to take up the question. ,of the National Assembly ; and expressed approval of the idea of common action between Greece, Rumania and Serbia.Port Control. Lord Granville reports that in reply to the French Minister, who-represented that Pirmus should come under the French Port Control, he has pointed out that a Greek naval zone was recommended at the Paris Conference, and that such a zone, if granted, would seem properly to include Piraeus.PORTUGAL.Politics. Sir L. Carnegie, in a despatch dated December 17th, points out that the new Government (sea Report No. 47) is composed almost entirely of Unionists and the allied Conservative Centre elements. For the first time for some years Oporto is well represented in the Ministry, which will, cause much satisfaction in the North. The majority of the Ministers are well known, and enjoy good reputations. The Minister of the Interior, Senhor Machado Santos, though not accused of holding anti-Ally sentiments, is believed to be opposed to PortngaPs active participation in the war, and his record, warrants the supposition. Of the various theories as to why Dr. Brito Camacho, the Unionist Leader, has kept in the background, the most probable is that he doubts the permanence of the present Administration, and is awaiting his opportunity to form a more stable Government. The Evolutionist Party has issued a declaration that it took no part in, and will assume no responsibilities on account of, the revolutionary movement.Coal. Sir L, Carnegie reports that the Foreign Minister has applied to His. Majesty&apos;s Government requesting the transport of coal for Lisbon, as the threatened failure of electric lighting and power would throw some 50,000 men out of work.ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.Turkey. Lord Granville learns from a good source that while the Turkish Government continues strongly impressed by the military power of Germany, there-is no desire in Turkey to allow German tutelage to continue after the war or to-
grant economic concessions to &quot;the Germans, who have made themselves rinutterabfy utipopular. There is a strong anxiety to take advantage of the earliest opportunity for peace, and this desire would be greatly accentuated if a Russian military offensive should recur. Sir 1:1. RumboJd learns from a reliable source that British prestige is as great as ever in Turkey and Bulgaria.Austria. The Kolnische Zeitung of. January 9th quotes Freiherr von Stein of the Imperial Board of Trade as saying thai &quot;negotiations with the representatives of the &quot; Austro-liungarian Empire concerning commercial (and ?) political rapprochement &quot; had been so far of a purely preliminary character. The German Government had &quot; up to date committed itself to no decision or undertaking of any sort.&quot;Sir W. Townley reports that according to a Vienna telegram, the summoning of the Austrian House of Representatives is likely to be postponed from the 15th to the 20th of January, in expectation of some result from the Brest-Litovsk negotiations. Mr, Bindley reports that the Austrians are anxious to agree with the conditions of the Bolshevists in regard to exchange of prisoners, but are entirely subordinated to the Germans.GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.Cloning of Frontiers. The Basle National. Zeitung reports on January 11th to Butch papers that the German-Swiss and German-Dutch frontiers will be closed to travellers and to traffic for two months. Sir VV. Townley reports an almost complete stoppage of German papers to Holland.Condition of the People. The Foreign Office learns from a reliable source that among the great mass of the Berlin population an appalling situation is created, by the lack of food, light, warmth, clothing, boots, and soap. The well-to-do classes still live fairly comfortably, though prices are enormous. The military caste adores Hindeuburg and hates Ludendorff; and the middle class loves .Ludendorff, because he gives high posts in the army to Jews. But the Imperial family, Hindenburg, and the Government are loathed by the working classes, which are only deterred by helplessness from revolting. Sir H. Rum bold learns that it is generally thought in Berlin, that it will be impossible to feed the civilian population there between February and May. Mutinies are reported to have taken place in barracks near Berlin, the troops firing on their officers and refusing to go to the front.Sir R. Pa get learns from a reliable source that considerable Turkish forces have been seen in Cologne.Sir W. Townley reports that Dr. Waldow, the Prussian State Food Controller,, addressing 700 food lecturers on January 8th, said : &quot; Now that you are starting on your work of bringing an understanding of the existing conditions to the remotest parts of the country, bear in mind that it is a question of applying your whole strength and nerve to the inculca-tion of the cardinal fact that all those rivers of precious German blood will have flowed in vain if now, before the victorious end, hearts fail&apos; in. self-sacrifice and endurance. And one thing more : help us to dispel the unholy misunderstanding prevailing between town and country, between consumers and producers, which eats into the harmony of the people like a malignant cancer. We must be a united -people of brethren whom neither need or hardships can estrange. Go forth, and in this spirit accomplish your great work.&quot;People and Government. The Intelligence Bureau notices a strong expression of returning confidence in the German Press of all political colours. This is primarily due no doubt to official inspiration, but has probably a real foundation in. the military situation. The policy of the Government is to encourage the impression that the -continuance of the war is due to the Allies&apos; refusal to treat at Brest-Litovsk, and to raise hopes of a righteous and successful appeal by arms against this refusal. (The German Wireless Press of January 1.2th by quoting a pro-German speech of the President of the Bezirtag of Lower Alsace reverts to the- policy of trying to prove4761 - 3bi:
that aggressive intentions towards Germany by the Entente Powers brought about the war.) Failure to achieve a military success or to continue to justify its necessity in the face of the Allied pronouncements of war aims, would react most seriously upon the faith and hopes of the German people. It is, at the same time, pointed out that the &quot;industrialists are much more bellicose than the military&quot;; and that while the Government itself is unwilling to accept genuine self-determination in the East (as this would ruin Germ any&apos;s outposts, the &quot;Baltic Barons&quot;), it is the industrialists who oppose the policy of &quot; no annexations,&quot; since this would lose them territory so important as the Briey minefields. It is therefore highly desirable that the Allies should demonstrate to industrial Germany that her future economic relations with the rest of the world, depend upon the speed with which she can make a peace acceptable to the Allies. Mopes should not in present circumstances be founded on the probability of a popular revolt. Such a revolt might, however, take place if the German people, now grown less subservient, were thwarted or seriously disappointed by its Government. In. this connection Sir W. Townley reports the present internal conflict over Suffrage Reform as being pregnant with possibilities of great trouble in the near future, and of more interest at the moment to the German public than the war itself.War Aims. Sir W. Townley reports an official announcement that the Chancellor will, in the near future, speak at the sitting of the Main Committee upon the political situation and reply to the speeches of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson. No report has been received indicating the probability of the Reichstag itself being assembled. The National Liberals have declared their intention to stand by such a conception of the proper frontiers of Germany as the Superior Army shall put forward.Germany and the Vatican. The Ttheinische Westfalisclic Zeitung in its issue of January 12th has an article entitled &quot; Questionable neutrality of the Vatican,&quot; attacking the observations made by the Osservatore Romano in regard to German air attacks upon Padua.&apos; Supplies from the East. According to the Svenska, Dagbladet an agreement has been reached at Brest-Litovsk under which marine traffic is reopened between Germany and Finland. Mr. land ley learns that the German Naval Mission is endeavouring in its negotiations with the Russian General Naval Staff to secure terms under which British influence in the White Sea and Northern. Ocean, would, lie defeated. Sir II. Rum bold learns that a new broad-gauge railway is under con-struction for the Eastern front, to allow of Russian trains coming into Germany. Sir Or. Barclay reports that prisoners are returning to Germany from Rumania in large numbers, and that arms, ammunition, and horses are being sold to the Germans.NETHERLANDS.Sand and Gravel. The War Trade Intelligence Department reports that discussions are still proceeding between the British and Netherlands Governments upon the question of transit of sand, gravel and other military material from Germany over Dutch waterways to Belgium. The question is now complicated by a large increase in the exports from Holland to Belgium of Dutch sand and gravel. Proposals made by the Foreign Office as to limitation and control of the traffic are now under consideration by the Dutch authorities. The Intelligence Bureau points out that at present neither side seems inclined to give way. As the effect of the stoppage of cables by Great Britain is felt in wider circles, the support originally given by the Dutch Press, with few exceptions, to the attitude of their Cabinet has been losing in. vigour. The idea of an arbitration between Holland, Great Britain and Germany finds the most favour, as, whichever way the verdict went, Holland would be safe, while a concession now made by Holland to Great Britain Avould only displace the conflict and raise trouble with Germany. The whole conflict, while doubtless necessitated by military con-siderations, has had an unfortunate effect upon British propaganda. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech has also caused bitter disappointment among the Dutch people, whose geographical position inclines them towards peace at any price.
Hops. Sir W. Townley reports that the exportation of hops from Holland lias been prohibited as from January 1,0th.Economic Union&apos;. The Intelligence Bureau sets out the programme of the new Economic Union, formed, by the present Finance Minister, Professor Treub. This includes : Parliamentary Control of international Affairs.Protection of Labour in Shops and Offices.Old. Age Pensions and Insurance.AVoman&apos;s Suffrage.Taxation in proportion to Means.Increase in the Salaries of Government Servants.The Economic Union is a Party of Reconstruction, and will certainly play a part in the General. Election next summer. Professor Treub is a thorough believer in the Entente cause, and his programme is warmly taken up by the Telegraaf. The new party has not, however, been generally welcomed by the Press, being considered materialistic and anti-religious by the Clericals, and capitalistic and imperialistic by the Socialists.SWITZERLAND.Wheat Supply. Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the United States negotiators are pressing for the supply and transport by Great Britain and France of 30,0U0 tons of wheat promised to Switzerland under the Swiss-American Agreement. Sir II. Rumbold urges the desirability of such supply, and suggests that the French Govern-nient should also return 15,000 tons, which amount was previously advanced by Switzerland for French consumption. German propaganda is making great rise of the Allies&apos; failure to fulfil their undertaking, and the German Government has officially offered to make up the shortage ; this offer the Swiss Government has refused. The Foreign Office has instructed -Sir (..&apos;. Spring Rice, that while concurring as to the policy and. necessity of furnishing the wheat, His Majesty&apos;s Government is not in. a position to allocate the tonnage, and trusts that the United States Govern-ment will see its way to employ for that purpose neutral ships now in American waters.British Prohibitions. The Foreign Office advises Sir R. Rodd that, pending a satisfactory result of negotiations with Switzerland, all. exports to that country of cloth, yarn, and raw cotton will be stopped: and it is hoped that similar action will be taken by the Italian Government. There is evidence to show that Germany is trying to obtain large quantities of these commodities for explosive factories.NORWAY.Supplies. Sir M. Findlay reports that the Storthing reassembled on January .11th. The Norwegian Government, either from hope of an early peace or of obtaining supplies from other quarters, or else from fear 51: reprisals by a victorious Germany, threats of which are already being made by the German Minister, seems indisposed to -conclude negotiations wdth the Allies. It is stated that the Germans have offered the -Norwegians 2-10,000 tons of grain. Norwegian, Swedish and Danish Commissioners have already met at Christiania and will meet again in Stockholm to discuss inter-Scandinavian commercial exchange. It appears that Sweden requires fish and nitrates, and Denmark carbide, pig-iron and nitrates, from Norway ; while Norway requires iron, steel and timber from Swreden, and agricultural produce from Denmark. Sir M. Findlay fears that undesirable agreements may be made unless the Allied negotiations are expedited.Escorts.   Sir M. Findlay learns that the Norwegian Foreign Minister has mentioned to the United States Minister a protest, stated to have been lodged by the German Government, against the admission of Allied escorts into Norwegian territorial waters.
SWEDEN.Imports from Finland. Sir E. Howard reports the arrival at Stockholm, of the-steamship Minerva, bringing lubricating oils and grease from Finland. Sixty tons of petroleum are stated to be on. the way to Sweden via Helsingfors.   .Russian Contracts. The Foreign Office instructs Sir E. Howard to investigate,, with a view to action, the present position of Paissian contracts in Sweden approved for payment out of British credits.DENMARK.Iceland. Sir R. Paget, in a despatch dated December 10th, reports that the movement for a revision of the relations between Iceland and Denmark has been, strengthened by the war, owing, to the military measures of the belligerents which have rendered communications difficult and have greatly impeded trade between Denmark, and Iceland. &quot;The Icelanders have accordingly been, thrown largely on their own &quot; resources, and have come to feel less dependent on the mother country. Danes are &quot; inclined to attach to His Majestys Government a considerable amount of blame for &quot; this state of things, and. they resent in particular the action of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-&quot; ment in concluding an agreement with the Icelandic Government direct in 1910 &quot; without consulting the Danish Government. Though the latter tacitly acquiesced in &quot; the fait accompli, there is no doubt that they felt acutely the impetus thus given to &quot; the movement for independence. It is for these reasons that the Danish Government &quot; attach so much importance to such questions as the conveyance of passengers and &quot; mails to Iceland by Danish ships, as they feel that the interruption of these services, &quot; which they are bound by contract to maintain, would further weaken their hold on &quot; the colony.&quot;SPAIN.Politics. The Intelligence Bureau points out that the Dissolution of Parlia-ment has been brought about by the Regional!sts under Seiior Gam bo, and that they will doubtless win more seats at the elections than ever before. It is probable that seats will also be gained by the Republicans. There is, however, no reason to expect any important change of Spanish Foreign policy, &quot;which will remain mildly pro-Ally. The main problems of the new Parliament will be domestic, namely, the questions of amnesty for the general strike of last summer, adjustment of the claims of the Officers&apos; juntas, and relief of the food and transport difficulties. The last of these problems is being used by the German propaganda as a handle against the Allies ; and at least one pro-German paper is suggesting that, on the Allied principles of self-determination and no annexations, Gibraltar must be returned to Spain after peace is signed.JAPAN.Anglo-Japanese Compliments. Telegrams exchanged between His Majesty and the Emperor of Japan by which each appoints the other Field Marshal have been warmly received. The event is noted as unique, as the King is the first non-Japanese Sovereign to receive this Japanese dignity, and the Emperor the only non-British sovereign now holding this rank.CHINA.Plague-Sh J. Jordan reports an outbreak &quot;of pneumonic plague at the Fengchen railhead, 13 hours distance from Pekiri. As a consequence all traffic on the Pekin-Kalgan line has been stopped, and the Chinese Government has been urged to take ail possible precautions.
BOLIVIA.Enemy Trade. Mr.- Haggard suggests that representations should be made to the United States Government in regard to the continued export to the United States of minerals and other products by enemy firms in Bolivia acting through intermediaries.MEXICO.German Intrigue. Mr. Cummins reports that the newspaper Universal, which, has the largest circulation in Mexico, in its issue of January 10th, demands the expulsion of the German Minister for violating the neutrality of the country. tGarranza. Mr. Cummins reports that, in spite of statements to the contrary, Carranza, with military forces, is now at Necaxa, which is on the shortest Avagon road to the oilfields. According to Mexican newspapers, Government forces are advancing from various directions upon Pelaez. Conspiracies are on foot in several cities, and revolutionary plot has been discovered and frustrated in Mexico City, Toluca, Vera Cruz and Salina Cruz. In many cities hunger is being felt, and maize is being imported from the United States. Officials of the Industrial and Financial Depart-ments arc proceeding to Washington to adjust differences between the United States and Mexican Governments. Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the United States Foreign Office does not at present regard the oilfields as being in sufficient danger to warrant A in american int erv entiori.CUBA.Presidential Message. Mr. Leech reports that the Presidential message to Congress asks for full powers to deal with food supply, exports, and the persons and property of enemy subjects in Cuba ; also for authority for Government to take control of the railways if this should be found necessary.UNITED&apos;STATES OF AMERICA.Catholic Opinion. Sir C. Spring Rice reports that there is unrest amongst the German and Irish Catholics in the United States. The dissatisfaction of the latter appears to be due to three principal causes : first, the inferred exclusion of the Pope,4761-3b C&apos; argentina. ; 9 ---   .-..Wheat Convention-The Yfar Trade Intelligence Department reports the settleiherit of the financial arrangements for the purchase of the Argentine grain surplus.1 The British and French Governments engage to buy 2,500,000 tons of Argentine grain or other produce, and. to open credits, in favour of the Argentine Government, of 20,000,000/. in London and Fr. 500,000,000 in Paris. The Argentine Government undertakes to open a credit in Buenos Aires of $100,000,000 in favour of Great Britain, and an equivalent credit in favour of France. Exchange is to be at a fixed rate. Sir R. Tower reports that the United States Governrnent proposes immediately upon the signature of the Wheat Convention to supply coal to the Argentine in ships sent South to fetch the wheat.Enemy Trade-Sir R. Tower represents the desirability of financial support being-given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to British firms in the detection and prevention of transfers and sales of goods to enemy firms in the Argentine.

Sir C. Spring Rice reports that measures are being taken to establish uniformity between British and American Black Lists for Latin America.     ,SHIPPING SITUATION. .Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Report, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period January 4&apos;th-lOfch, 1918, inclusive, was 100,646 tons gross, of which 76,092 were British, as compared with 91,795, of which 62,406 were British, reported last week.Building. Sir C. Spring Rice reports Mr. Hurley as accepting Lloyd&apos;s estimate of 3,700,000 tons as the probable output for 1918. Sir Thomas Royden, however, has reported that the output will probably not exceed 2,000,000 gross tons. The output, of wooden ships is rather optimistically estimated at 1,500,000 tons.An Admiralty report estimates that, if steel and labour are both forthcoming, British output of merchant vessels for 19.18 should amount ^to ] ,841,250 tons. The German Wireless Press reports a calculation by &quot;Nautilus,&quot; correspondent of the Nieuwe liotterdamsclte Courant, according to which the Entente, in order to bring about a possible victory in the spring of 1919, must build 20,000,000 tons &quot;during 1918. &quot; Of this amount, as the other Entente countries could, at the highest estimate, only build 5,000,000 tons, 15,000,000 fall to the lot of America.&quot;Convoy System.--The Ministry of Shipping estimates that, over a year, the vessels now convoyed will bring in at least 1,000,000 tons of imports more than they would have brought unconvoyed; and that at the end of the year there will be more shipping, probably by 750,000 gross tons, than, but for the convoy system, would have been available.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.Russia. [Note. On September 5th, 1914, the Russian Ambassador in London, &quot; duly authorised by the Russian Government,&quot; signed a joint agreement with France and Great Britain &quot; not to conclude peace separately during the present war,&quot; and further, that &quot; when terms of peace come to he discussed no one of the Allies will &quot; demand conditions of peace without the previous agreement of each of the other &quot; Allies.&quot;]The Intelligence Bureau on January 9th expressed the opinion, based on Press reports, that the clause in the Russian terms of. peace applying the principle of self-determination to people within the frontiers of existing States who had not hitherto been independent could not possibly be agreed to by the German Government.The Intelligence Bureau further report that in the present Bolshevist Government, Lenin, Trotsky and Radek are the most interesting figures. The influence of Lenin is not less than that of Trotsky. His name means far more with the Russian masses. He is the most consistent politician in Russia ; since the beginning of his career he lias never wrave.red, while Trotsky has been much more supple and undecided. Lenin is visionary, fanatical, without sense of humour. Trotsky is equally fanatical in defence of principles, equally unwilling to compromise,, but has a keen sense of humour combined with great ambition. Lenin is probably the steadying influence. Radek is still more unconstrained than Trotsky. It was he who insisted on raising the question of the arrest of Liebknecht. The ordinary Russian takes little interest in the sufferings of German Socialist comrades, and the raising of any issue, that might make peace difficult would be regarded as unnecessary and provocative.   It is
probable that the --Germans are already: intriguing with.the political opponents of the, Bolshevists, ydiether.;Social. -Revolutionaries or bourgeois. How long. Ti;ots,ky will remain. in power -will depend upou his own statesmanship.,,,,.11 is -impossible&apos;, to .say whether the Bolshevists, if they failed to get peace and defy Germany, would retain the support of the war-weary masses in defence of a principle.German wireless on January 10th published an unsigned appeal, purporting to to have been issued from Petrograd &quot; To All &quot; at 8.-10 a.m. on January 6th, in which insinuations are made that the Entente Allies, in their own interests, are &quot;allowing &quot; Russia to make a separate peace, thus consciously betraying Poland, Lithuania, Courland, and Rumania, and using them as &quot;coins with which to settle accounts with Germany.&quot;Mr. Lindley reports that at Brest on January 10th the Russian Delegates described the German attitude as an ultimatum, giving the choice between negotiations at Brest or no negotiations at all. They interpret this ultimatum to mean that the Powers of the Quadruple Alliance supporting a negotiation policy prefer to break off negotiations on formal technical points to breaking them off on the question of Poland, Lithuania, &amp;c. The Bolshevists, issued a statement, particularly to the German people that their reason for staying at Brest is to continue the struggle for the people&apos;s peace, and to ascertain clearly whether peace can be concluded with the Quadruple Alliance without prejudicing the chance of the Poles, Lithuanians, &amp;c, to self-determination without reservation or ulterior motives. German wireless on January 13th simply reported that on January 10th the Russians expressed their willingness to continue peace negotiations at Brest.According to German wireless (January 14th) the interpretation of the right of self-disposal, of nations was discussed at Brest on. January 11th and 12th, and -(January loth) the sitting on, the 12th &quot;came to a close, no further sitting haying, been arranged.&quot;Ukraine.--Mr. Lindley reported on January 10th an official annotincement in the Press at Petrograd that on -January 7th an agreement was come to between the Russian Peace Delegation and the Ukraine Representatives authorising the latter to negotiate at Brest as official delegates of the Ukraine Republic. German wireless has reported that on January 10th M. Trotsky stated at Brest that the Ukrainian Delegation had been recognised as Independent by the Bolshevist Delegation.At the meeting of January .12th, the Quadruple Alliance declared their recognition of Ukrainian delegation^ independence, &apos; the formal recognition of the Ukrainian Republic as an independent State being reserved for the Treaty of Peace. M. Trotsky declared that there were no troops in occupation, of Ukraine and self-determination could there be accomplished.Poland. The Intelligence- Bureau on January .11th reported that about December 20th, the Polish Government asked the Central Powers to admit Polish representatives to the peace negotiations, and the Polish Premier visited Berlin and Vienna. It was decided that Polish Delegates would be admitted but apparently in an advisory position.Rumania. The Foreign Office informed Sir G. Barclay on January 13th that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech made it clear that we require the occupied parts of Rumania to be restored, also the -withdrawal of invading armies and compensation for injustices.   Other subjects affecting Rumania in the speech were explained., Germany.   Sir W. Townley reported on January 9th information froln the German Press on the Peace negotiations. The most interesting point is a statement in the Dresdner Volks Zeitung that the German Independent Socialists before Christmas sent a telegram to the Bolshevists to ask them to delay these negotiations, because the development of German affairs was turning in favour of the Independent Socialists,- and a separate peace with Russia was hampering the continuation of the Revolutionary movement, and strengthened the ruling classes in Germany. This circumstance was thought to have inspired a violent article in the Kolnische Zeitung of January 8th threatening the Bolshevists with new blows by the strong and sharp German weapons if negotiations Avere broken off to support German Socialist Democracy.Sir C. Spring Rice reported on January 2nd that the representative of the Vatican-and the Dutch and Swedish Legations in Washington were saying that Germany
would soon&apos; make peace proposals and hinting that&apos; the Military Authorities in Germany, were: being seriously threatened: The State Department attribute-the rum ours&apos;.&apos;to&apos; an attempt &apos;by Germany to weaken public opinion&apos; in the United States. -Sir W-. Tdwnley quotes on&quot; January iOth from Dusselrlorfer Nachriclited the opinion that Lenin and Trotsky will lose their power, and Germany must expect the Bolshevist Government to try and protract the Peace negotiations in order to breach the gulf between them and moderate Socialist elements.Sir G. Spring Rice reports on January 12th, on the authority of the State Depart-ment of Washington, that the President s speech will probably be replied to in the Reichstag shortly. Sir W. Townley sends, on January 11th, extracts from German Press expressing exasperation at the speech.Mr. Lindley reports on January 11th, on the authority of an Official Report dated January 9th of the Peace Conference at Brest, that the German Conference Minister presided and formally rejected the transference of the negotiations to Stockholm on account of want of telegraphic facilities, and because in the conduct of negotiations the atmosphere in which they take place &apos;plaj?s an enormous role. There appears to be no doubt the Germans desire a separate peace with Russia, butvnot as a result of a climb-down on their part, as such a climb-clown would be a severe blow to German militarism. If the German militarists are strong enough, they may break off negotiations with the Bolshevists and intrigue with their opponents, and rely upon a threat of invasion to force the Russians to agree to a separate peace with Eastern Europe.German, wireless records another strong protest by General Hoffman at Brest against Rtissian propaganda in Germany, because it did not strive for a durable peace,, and might introduce revolution and civil war into Germany. M. Trotsky replied that German Pressmen had been allowed to enter Russia freely. General Hoffman answered that his criticism was directed against official propaganda issued above the-signature of Krylenko.All the Central Power delegates have protested very strongly against Socialist, pamphlets and proclamations which abound in their lines.Austria-Hungary. Mr. Lindley reports on January 9th that the Austrians are-anxious to agree with the Bolshevist conditions, especially about prisoners of war, but are entirely dominated by the Germans.Turkey.-Mr. Lindley reported on January 9th the Turkish terms of peace which: were brought forward conditionally at the Brest Conference.Bulgaria. Sir II. Rumbold reported on January 7th, on good authority, that when the Kaiser visited Sofia, an agreement was come to between Germany and Bulgaria that, if a separate peace should be made -with Russia, Bulgaria, with the assistance of German and Austrian troops, should drive the Allies out of Salonika and should then keep the place.He further reports (January 10th) rumours, on the authority of Bulgarian delegates at Brest, of the certainty of a separate peace between Russia and Bulgaria, but not with Austria.France. Lord Bertie drew attention on January 3rd to, an article by M. Longuet in the l^ays  criticising strongly the French diplomacy during 1917, and stating-that to prevent French Socialism from establishing direct relations with that of Russia-was one of the gravest of errors.. Lord Bertie further reported on January 10th the general support in the French press of President Wilson s speech.Belgium. Sir F. Yilliers reports on January 1st a statement by a German, commercial magnate that Germany was ready to communicate ijeace proposals and intentions of reparation to Belgium. The statement was made verbally and unofficially with a view to its being repeated to the Belgian Legation, who returned, no reply.-Italy. -Sir Rennell Rodd reports a speech by Signer Orlando in the Italian Senate on December 31st, in which be shows up the insincerity of the attitude of the Central Empires in the Brest negotiations, and adds the words, &quot; We are not
GENERAL.Berne Agreement. In a report dated January 4th Lord Newton sets out the terms of the Berne Agreement (which only awaits ratification by the Ottoman Govern-in ent) in regard to exchanges, inspection and treatment of prisoners, and facilitation of information in regard to them. For the- purposes of exchange a low standard of disability has been adopted, and examinations will be made every three months by commissions of three doctors (two of the captor State and one a prisoner of Avar). One British doctor per 1,000 prisoners will be retained for this purpose. Pending this examination, 1,000 British prisoners, irrespective of rank (300 white and 700 Indians), are to be exchanged for 1,500 invalid lurks. Civilians not of military age, including men of the mercantile marine, will be repatriated if they so desire. Those of military age can be exchanged in equal numbers. The iim-maize n&quot; confronted with a sincere initiative, but with an insidious measure, aimed at &quot; disuniting and poisoning the minds of the belligerent nations. We of the Entente &quot; have too profound a respect for. the feelings which really inspire our desire for &quot; peace, not to protest against any attempt to make peace proposals an insidious &quot; weapon in waging war.&quot;&amp;Ve&apos;ece.---Lord Granville reported on January .10th an interview with M. Venizelos about Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech, and on local dissatisfaction at Eastern Macedonia not having been mentioned amongst the territory which must be vacated by. the enemy. Lord Granville explained that this point might be considered as covered by the expressions used about nationalities and the consent of the governed. He reported further on January 11th about anxiety in the Greek newspapers regarding Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s statement about Turkey-, which anxiety has been relieved by the explanation in the -Manchester Guardian that only the interior of Asia Minor was referred to, and not the Provinces where Hellenism dominates.United States. Sir C. Spring Rice on Januaiy 8th reported that the Presidents speech took the Congress by surprise, it was very well received, especially about Alsace-Lorraine. The following point amongst others was brought out in conversation with influential Americans : The question of the &quot; Freedom of the seas &quot; did not arise excepting in the event of certain international agreements, and the actual conditions were left over for discussion.On account of the importance of the subject, it is proposed to deal with this question in an Appendix to next week&apos;s Report, embodying the substance of further statements by President Wilson explaining the situation. A. sidelight on German policy affecting the freedom of the seas is given in the following report dated January 12th, from Sir W. Town ley :-&quot; Wolffs Agency states that the &apos; Egyptian National Committee &apos; in Berlin have issued a manifesto to the Peace Conference by Fafid Bey urging the liberation.of the Egyptians on the principle of nationality, and adding that, while the Suez Canal remains under the control of a great Power, there can be no guarantee of the &quot;freedom of the seas.&apos; &quot;Sweden. Sir E. Howard reports (January 9th) interviews given by Mr. Huysman to representatives of the Press in which he says that he is coming to England to take part in an English revolution. He disclaims co-operation between the Conference of Socialists and the Bolshevists, but if the latter would co-operate with the Inter-national for a general Peace, they would be welcomed. He added that the removal of the Peace negotiations from Brest to Copenhagen would almost certainly take place in two or three weeks. Sir E. Howard thinks that Mr. Huysman is an honest supporter of a general democratic peace, and opposed to German Imperialism. He is vain, and tries to attract public attention.Spain. According to the Intelligence Bureau (January 9th) at least one pro-German paper is suggesting that, on the Allied principle of self-determination and no-annexations, Gibraltar must be returned to Spain, after peace.
Li-order of -the exchanges will he: first, invalid combatants and medical officers ; secondly, men of the mercantile marine ; thirdly, civilians. The exchanges are to be carried out by sea if possible. With regard to inspection and treatment, the Dutch Legation (subject to reciprocity) is authorised to visit alL camps in Turkey, except those situated in the military area of the Taurus and east and south of that range. Prisoners now in that area will be withdrawn, if possible, to places.where they can be,visited. Help/Committees- are to be established in all camps. Undertakings are given with regard to suitable lodging, medical treatment, facilities for purchase of food and clothing, and for transmission of supplies, &amp;c. With regard to information, the censorship of letters, parcels, &amp;c, wall be accelerated ; and provision is made for the&quot; better supply of lists of prisoners, death certificates, and as to correspondence between prisoners and the Dutch Legation.The. Turkish Government has been asked to perm it the internment in Switzerland of 90 invalid prisoners from Turkey (now at IVIauthausen) pending the arrival of Turkish invalids shortly expected from Marseilles.Prisoners in Occupied Territory. Sir W. Townley reports that the German Government refuses to permit members of the Dutch Legation at Berlin to visit prisoners&apos; camps in occupied territories, with the exception of the Indian camp in Wallachia.Arrivals in Holland. General Williams reports that five further parties of 300 officers and non-commissioned officers will arrive at short intervals in Holland.Hospital Ships. -The Kolnische Volhs Zeitung of January 3rd, in an article entitled &quot; English Hospital Ships,&quot; accuses the British of their abuse, and observes, &quot; Such &quot; abuses have not hitherto provoked, our Fleet into entirely ignoring the Geneva &quot; Cross .... but, if this is not to happen, some very strong measures will have to &quot; be adopted to prevent their recurrence.&quot; The paper then proceeds to deny that the Reioa was torpedoed.Serbian Prisoners. Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the United States Red Cross is prepared to undertake the provisionment of Serbian prisoners of war.In the Appendix to this Report are set out lists of (A) States in alliance with Great Britain, (B) Neutral countries which have severed diplomatic relations with Germany.
