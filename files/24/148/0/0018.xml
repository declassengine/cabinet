As affecting the issue of the war, the most, important developments of the peace negotiations conducted by the Germans during the past four months with Russia, the Ukraine, Finland, and (inmania, have been -(I) The destruction or demobilisation of national armies hostile to Germany, so that, small German armies are now able to carry out the avowed German war aim of &quot; economic development in every direction,&quot; at the expense of countries unable to defend their own possessions, and (2) The seizure by the Germans of all Russian war vessels upon which they can lay their hands. Unlike the defeated or demobilised armies of their opponents, the war vessels may ultimately add materially to German strength in conducting the war. This raises -questions of naval strategy which are beyond the scope of this Report.Eumania.

fart ii. foreign and general.GENERAL.The Executive War Board. The Supreme War Council has agreed that, in view of the appointment of General Foch as General-in-Chief of the Allied Armies on the Western Front, the Executive War Board, set up at the meeting of the Supreme War Council held on February 2nd, should be dissolved. The War Cabinet has approved this proposal.Far Easi.-The Foreign Office learns that owing to the protection afforded by the landing parties (see Reports Nos. 63-65), the situation at Vladivostock continues satisfactory. The prospects of forming an efficient local police force are small on account of division of authority and lack of funds. A movement in favour of an autonomous Siberia is stated to be gaining ground, especially in the country districts ; its leaders are soliciting Allied support,Shillings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of: sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the Kirig&apos;s enemies during the period April 26th-May 2nd inclusive was 79,068 tons gross, of which 59,161 were British, as compared with 49,416 tons gross, of which 42,412 were British, reported last week.The Admiralty reports that of a total 11,116,800 gross tonnage of merchant vessels sunk by enemy action up to March 31st, 1918, 8,985,276 was Allied (of which 6,722,891 was British) and 2,131,524 neutral.Construction. An Admiralty announcement of May 9th to the Press- gives particulars of British, Allied and neutral shipping construction to date as compared with that completed in previous periods of the Avar (see next issue of this Report).Convoy System.  The Ministry of Shipping reports that out of 58,374,600 dead-weight capacity of shipping convoyed (homewards and outwards) up to April 27th,d 918, 691,000 was sunk, being a percentage of 117.German Prize Regulations and Tonnage Agreements. The German Reiehsanzeiger published on April 29th an addition to paragraph 55. Point C. of the German Prize Court Statutes, according to which, neutral vessels are further regarded as trading in the interest of enemy belligerents (in so far as circumstances do not contradict this) when the State whose flag they are entitled to fly has concluded, an agreement with an enemy State regarding cession of tonnage or when the bulk of the neutral State&apos;s merchant fleet is employed, in enemy trade. This addition (which is supplementary to one already made to the same paragraph on. duly 16th, 1917) appears to be aimed at the Northern Neutrals.Franco-German Agreement regarding Exchange and. Internment of Military and Civilian. Prisoners. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Derby to communicate to.the French Government the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the serious consequences likely to result from repatriation of fit German prisoners under the Agreement now awaiting ratification (see Report No. 66).British Prisoners at Ruhleben. Sir. W. Townley learns that certain publications in England regarding conditions in Germany by a prisoner repatriated from. Ruhleben have resulted in the severe treatment of prisoners there. .Invalids   interned  in   Holland.Su: W.   Towijley  reports   that   the   German * Government has agreed to a proposal made by the Netherlands Government for the repatriation of invalids interned in. Holland on certification by the Dutch. Medical Authorities,   ddie views of His Majesty&apos;s Government are requested.
ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.Forced Labour. Sir F. Villiers transmits evidence indicating that Belgian youths and hoys have been, deported and compelled to work behind the German lines ; the Belgian. Government intends to protest.CHINA.Enemy Aliens. Sir -I. Jordan reports that the attitude of: enemy residents at Shanghai is unruly, and may possibly develop into organised agitation. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General suggests that their deportation (see Reports Nos. 5.7, 58, 61, 63-65) should, be expedited.CUBA.German Financial Intrigue. Mr. Leech reports that the Banco Espanol, acting in German interests, is endeavouring, by the purchase of shares held in the United States, to obtain control of the Cuba Company, which in turn controls the Cuba Railroad Company.FRANCE.Socialists. The Union des Syndicate Ouvriers de la Seine issued an appeal on April 22nd to its organisations stating that the situation was too grave to permit of a stoppage of work on May 1st. The appeal pointed out that at the recent Socialist Conferences at Clermont-Ferrand and London the working classes of all countries expressed their desire to see the abolition of secret diplomacy, and, further, to see all belligerents announce their peace terms. The President of the United States had already done this, and Syndicalist organisations must be ready for vigorous action to secure a similar policy in other countries. It might shortly become necessary to organise general manifestations of opinion by the proletariat.Humanite of May 2nd published a manifesto issued by the Executive Committee of the French Socialist Party declaring that, whilst not forgetting the teachings of the great German Socialist, the same motives which opposed, the usual May Day celebrations are also against any commemoration celebrations in honour of the birthday of Karl Marx (May 5th).ITALY.The Oppressed Nationalities. Italian Wireless of &quot;May 3rd reports : &quot; Wo are informed that lately the Serb-Croat-Dalmat deputies have assembled at the Parliament House of Dalmatia and affirmed the full solidarity of the Jugo-Slavs with the Czechs. The following declaration was approved: &apos; We are quite in accord with the Ju go-Slav Committee of Vienna in calling for the union of the Croats, Slavs and the Serbs in an independent State. We protest against the arrangement under which the Dalmat Diet lias not been called for six years.&apos; Czecho-Slav units attached to the Italian Army had an affectionate reception from the population in the Avar zone and from the troops behind the first lines and also from the first line troops. The women of Verona offered the Czecho-Slavs a fighting banner with the Bohemian colours. The organisation of these units and. their discipline are perfect. The men are officered by compatriots chosen by the Entente Government acting in accord with the National Czecho-Slovak Committee and also by Italian officers.&quot; (See also under &quot; Austria-Hungary.&quot;)Criticism of Ministries. Sir R. Rodd reports that considerable criticism has lately been directed against the Ministries of Transports and Munitions, and that the -campaign against Baron Sonnino (see Report No. 48) is being revived.
Socialist Split. Italian &quot;Wireless of May 1st and 2nd reports a widening schism in the Italian Official Socialist Party between the intransigent elements, &quot;who are in a minority in numbers . aud intelligence,&quot; and the Parliamentary group, which does not refuse to collaborate with the Government and refrains from opposing the war.JAPAN.Anglo-Japaveso Relations. The Foreign Office has acknowledged in cordial terms a message from. Baron Goto in which he assures His Majesty&apos;s Government of the unswerving determination of the Japanese Government to stand by. the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.PORTUGAL.President Paes. The Foreign Office authorises Sir L. Carnegie to offer the congratulations of His MajestyA Government to Senhor Paes on the proclamation of his election as President. Upon formal notification of his accession to office, His Majesty&apos;s Government will take steps to indicate its recognition of the President.Political Situation. The ALinistry of the Interior considers that sufficient Deputies, and Senators have already been elected to assure a Government majority. The electors have therefore expressed their. approval of the Revolution of December. The three political parties, Evolutionists, Democrats and Unionists, are now definitely drawn up against the Government and, in sympathy of common opposition, are friendly to one another. In spite of statements to the contrary, it is certain that there have been many desertions from the Unionist Party on account of its opposition to the Government. Senhor Machado Santos, Minister of Food, recently told an interviewer that there &quot;was some possibility ,of a counter-revolution, but that this would easily be put down. He further stated that the country was in a state of complete political and economic anarchy.Monarchists. The views held by Senhor Paes regarding the Monarchists are reported as follows to the Foreign Office : The Monarchists may be divided into three parties. First, Dom ManuePs adherents, whose fidelity to the Allies is undoubted ; secondly, the Integralists, led by Count Monsaraz, who are certainly not Germanophil (the Integralists advocate the restoration of the Monarchy on mediaeval lines, but have no particular sovereign in view for the moment) ; thirdly, an indeterminate group (among whom is the suspect Senhor Antonio Telles de Yasconcellos, mentioned in Report Ho. 61), who may well be in collusion with, and in the pay of, the Germans. Neither of the first two parties is at present disposed to promote any revolutionary movement, which can. do them no good, and may restore the Democrats, their special enemies, to power. It is quite possible that the third may attempt to promote disorders.Import Duties on Luxuries.  Sir L. Carnegie reports the imposition, as from May 16th, of additional duties on imported articles of luxury.UNITED STATES.TJie Overman Bill. By 63 votes to 13 the Senate has passed the Overman Bill &quot; authorising the President to co-ordinate and consolidate the executive bureaux, agencies, and officers, and for all other purposes, in the interest of economy and the more effective administration of the Government.&quot; In the debate the Minority declared that the passage of the measure was a surrender by Congress of its constitu-tional functions. The passage of the Bill is considered as marking the most significant victory won by president Wilson since the United States entered the Avar. Only one Democratic Senator voted against the Bill. Further opposition is expected from Republicans in the House of Representatives, but the prospects are that, after a short struggle there, the Bill will become law (and see Report No. 55).
27ie Government War Finance Corporation. President Wilson has begun the organisation of the Government War Finance Corporation recently created by Congress, which has a capital of .100,000,0007,, with power to issue 800,000,0007.&quot; The live directors who will control the financing of war industries are the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. McAdoo (ex-officio); Governor Harding, of the Federal Reserve Board ; Mr. Allan B. Forbes, New York banker; Air. Eugene Meyer, jun., New York banker; and Mr. Angus McLean, banker and lawyer, of Wilmington, North Carolina.Tin. Lord Reading enquires the views of the Foreign Office upon proposals of the United States Government for Interallied control&apos;of tin supplies.German Wireless of April 29th quotes the Associated Press as announcing the prohibition, of tin and tin ores (inter alia) for export from the Dutch East Indies, and as stating that during the past year United States purchases from that source amounted to Lb,000 tons (and see under &quot;Netherlands&quot;).ENEMY GROUP.GERMANY.The Imperial Chancellor. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, the Military Party in Germany intends shortly to remove Hertling and substitute Hellferich as Imperial Chancellor.The 1 Vestem Offensive. According to further reports (see also Reports Nos. 61-83 and 64) received by the Foreign Office, there is considerable dissatisfaction and depression in Germany with the results hitherto obtained by tlie Western offensive. Confidence in the General Staff has been shaken, and wild rumours of German reverses are in circulation. Business men complain that they -are being sacrificed to the Military Party. It is stated that relations between the Kaiser and the Generals are strained, and that Hindenburg and Ludendorff have more than once threatened to resign unless they are allowed their own way in everything. It is expected that Hindenburg will now make a supreme effort to retrieve his reputation, which has suffered by the failure, so far, of his programme.Germany and the Ukraine, The Hamburger Fremdenblatt of April 25th says :  &quot; The Ukrainian obligation to deliver grain according to the peace treaty has not been fulfilled though tlie time has&apos; expired. The Ukrainian Government, headed by a professor who has strong doctrinarian social revolutionary ideas, issues regulations but does not enforce them, Either*the will or the power is lacking; hence the Central Bo were do not get the grain which is rightfully theirs, although the grain, actually exists in the Ukraine and Germany has reckoned upon. it. Reports of &apos; con-solidation &apos; of political affairs in the Ukraine are of little value, as this is hardly intended to enforce the peace treaty. The social revolutionist majority in the con-st it a ante is indifferent towards the re-establishment of economic intercourse with Germany and Austria. The Ukraine is offering a passive resistance to the treaty similar to that which the Bolshevists are offering to the German-Russian treaty. The-question is what steps are to be taken to enforce the treaty. If necessary, Germany must create her own organisations, although it would be better if the Ukrainian Government would itself exercise influence on the rural, population. General GroneFs proclamation to the Ukrainian farmers has annoyed. Ukrainian politicians, although it is in the Ukraiiie&apos;s own interest. The difficulties of administra-tion) in the Ukraine may be great, but fulfilment of treaties must be seen to.&quot; According to an Amsterdam message, a Berlin official telegram of May 2nd, after referring to the strong agitation now apparent in Kiev, which is directed against German influence there, savs : &apos; Our efforts to restore order have met with06s1- 2b r
insufficient support from the Government, which, &quot;moreover, lias taken no measures regarding the spring sowing to meet its treaty obligations. Therefore, with the approval of the Ambassador, Baron von Mumm, Field-Marshal von Eichhorn has been obliged to publish a decree with reference to the spring sowing, ddiis, however, was published, by the Ukrainian. Press in a distorted, manner, thus producing excitement in the country and evoking a protest from the Rada. There were even signs that members of the Government themselves had joined the agitation against us. In view of these conditions the arrest of M. Dobry, the manager of the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade, bears a special significance.&apos; The telegram also asserts that Dobry&apos;s arrest was an arbitrary act of the League for the Liberation of the Ukraine, and complains that the militia refused, to liberate him, and that his present place of abode is unknown. The telegram continues : &apos; Moreover, news has come in that further arrests are imminent. At the same time the grounds of suspicion have become intensified that M. Dobry&apos;s arrest was ordered by members of the Government. This arbitrary act means the resumption of anarchy. ddie Government has proved to be too weak to preserve law and order in Kiev. With the approval of the German Ambassador to the Ukraine, Baron von Mumm, the Field-Marshal has therefore taken special precautions for the security of Kiev, which, in general, aimed at the establishment of military tribunals, the severe punishment of criminals, and the imposition of severe penalties for all disturbers of public order. Meanwhile an inquiry into the Dobry case was opened by a German military tribunal, which led to the arrest of the War Minister, M. Shukowski, the Departmental Chief of the Ministry of the Interior, M. Dajewski, and Madame Tkatchenko, wife of the Minister of the Interior, the Commander of the town militia, M. Bogazki, and the Departmental Chief of the Foreign Ministry, M. Ljubinski. The inquiry is now proceeding.&apos; German Wireless of May 3rd alleges that according to a report from Kiev a change of Government has taken place in the Ukraine, owing to the intervention of the peasant deputies who have arrived in Kiev, ddie Rada and its Government, which no longer possessed any authority, has been overthrown, &quot;die formation of a new Ministry is now in progress, presumably under General Sko.ro-patzki. The Transocean correspondent learns that the German Military Administration is not involved in any way in the proceedings. The German Military Authorities do not in any sense interfere. The members of the Government&quot;who had been imprisoned in Kiev have in the meantime been liberated. This procedure has had nothing to do with the change of Government. German policy in. the Ukraine is elaborately defended&apos; by von Payer in the Main Committee of the Reichstag on May 4th. and by Bernhard in the Yossische Zeitung, the latter asking &quot; how one can get bread out of a weak Government without sending troops to assist it,&quot; and the former justifying Eichhoribs declaration of a &quot; state of enhanced protection &quot; for that purpose. ddie Hamburger 1&apos;remdenblalt of May 4th. reports a speech made by Scheidemann before the Reichstag Committee on Ukraine policy. . In the course of his remarks he &quot;says : &quot;Our troops in the Ukraine are in grave danger, because their number is relatively small and the population is armed .... Our present policy will raise the whole country against us ^. . . . ddie enthusiasm felt at the beginning of the offensive in the West is ebbing, and if no change has been accomplished soon, we must discuss these matters publicly.&quot; German Wireless of May 4th makes the following statement regarding supplies from the Ukraine: &quot;The organisation created for the collection, and transportation of provisions on the strength of the already announced agreement between the Central Powers and the Ukraine, has already come into operation. According to telegraphic reports from Kiev, two million centners of corn and provisions were put at the disposal of the Central Powers at the Ukrainian collecting stations during the last days of April. Considerable quantities have already passed the frontier. Of the first deliveries the greater part will, for the time being, be left to Austria-Hungary in view of the food difficulties prevailing in Austria at the present time. On account of the early arrival of the Hungarian crops, Austria-Hungary will he able to provide for herself in a few weeks from now. Therefore, in dune and July the greater part of the Ukrainian.transports will lie conducted to Germany. But even now, consign-ments are on their way from the frontiers to Germany. The cargoes of corn and other provisions which, are arriving in Braila across the Black Sea are being trans-ported to Germany direct over the railways. Thirty thousand centners have already arrived in Braila.&quot;
Germany and Russia. A. Wireless message 61: April. 26th from the Bolshevist Commissary for Foreign Affairs to the German Foreign Office demands precise explanations of the continuance of German hostilities in Finland and the Ukraine, and a definite declaration as to whether the German Government considers the conditions of the Brest Treaty as remaining in force. It is pointed out that in the existing circumstances the Soviet Government considers itself .compelled to mobilise all necessary forces in order to secure the freedom and &quot;independence of the Russian Republic which is now menaced beyond the limits established by that Treaty.According to a report received hy the Foreign Office German fear of Bolshevist revolutionary infection is shown, by the unusually large proportion of officers to men (as much as 1 to 15) in the German troops in Russia, and by the limitations placed, on the repatriation of prisoners,Germany and Poland.--la a Memorandum (G.T. 1139), dated April 25th, the Political Intelligence Department discusses the political, situation, iii Poland, and. observes that the Inter-Party Union, which forms the majority of the Council of State in &quot;Warsaw, while it may continue to oppose the Germans, nevertheless shares their dread of Bolshevism. German threats of annexation will keep Polish resistance alive ;-. Bolish expansion at the expense of Great Russia would seem to he inconsistent with British. anti-German policy.Germany and Bulgaria. The Foreign Office is informed that some time ago there was considerable friction between Germany and. Bulgaria over the question of food. The Germans accused the Bulgarians of living in luxury and not sending into Germany food that might easily have been spared.&quot; The Germans succeeded in getting rid of the Bulgarian Food Controller, Protogerov.Germany and Turkey. The Foreign Office is informed that the German failure to assist the Turks in Mesopotamia and Palestine has been freely criticised in Turkish official circles.Germany and the Jews. The Jewish Press Bureau at Stockholm states on April 30th : In order to counterbalance Entente influence, a Committee of non-Jewish politicians and economists has been formed in Berlin for the purpose of furthering Jewish colonisation in Palestine within the limits of German Oriental policy. Among the members of the Committee tire Dr. Delbrock, Count Westarp, 11 err Erzhorger, Dr. Scheidemann, and Professor Werner Sombart (see cdso Report No. 66).Russian Prisoners as Propagandists. An article in the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung of March 9th calls attention to the use which may be made of Russian prisoners in connection with German trade propaganda. It may be summarised as follows : -Now that peace between Germany and Russia has Teen signed prisoners of war can be exchanged. The vast hordes of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners who have been &quot; guests &apos;* in Germany have, on the whole, been obedient, industrious and willing. Many of them have been able to get an insight into German agriculture and industry, others to study the organisation of the Post and Railway Services, or of the educational system, &amp;c. These prisoners will be able to take much that they have learnt back with them to their homes, and there relate what they have seen and learnt whilst with the &quot;Huns.&quot; It would be to Germany^ interest if prisoners, who are business men, students, or intellectual workmen, were to lie picked out, formed into groups, and, before being sent home, taken through some of the larger German cities, through factories, museums, schools, &amp;c, so as to give them the opportunity &quot;of learning the secret of Germany&apos;s power. The writer thinks that this plan would tend to re-establish the good feeling between the two nations, and would be thoroughly appreciated by the intelligent Russian prisoners. If these inspection tours are promptly organised, then the first step towards increasing intercourse between the two nations could be managed without much extra burden on the railway service.Prussian Franchise Reform Bill. Berlin telegrams report that the motion to restore the clause introducing equal suffrage into the Prussian Franchise Reform Bill, from which it had been removed by the Committee, was defeated in the Diet in plena by 235 votes to 183, with four abstentions. Frieclberg, for the Government, announced that it would wait for the third reading before deciding its.attitude.
Ferghana. Raw Cottoii. The Foreign Office is informed that the Germans are making great efforts to secure Ferghana raw cotton via Krasnovodsk or Samuit.The Eighth War Loan, According to German Wireless of April 30th, the President of the Imperial Bank, Dr. Havenstein, stated in a sitting of the Central Committee of the Imperial Bank : The result up to the present of the Eighth War Loan has been fixed at Mk. 14,766,2-17,100, that is to say, over 1% millions higher than the biggest loan we have had, namely, the sixth. The field subscriptions, which are still outstanding, ought to Bring, the final results still nearer to the full fifteen milliards. Of the war credits granted up to the present, which amount to 124 milliards, 87-f-milliards have been consolidated in. long-term loans, and there is no doubt that the econonry and spirit of sacrifice of the German nation, which is ever develojung in strength, will, also maintain itself brilliantly in the future. Havenstein denies the report in the New York newspapers that he stated at the beginning of last year that Germany must break down when her war expenditure amounted to .100 milliards, and he says that these reports are pure inventions and fresh proof of the bad fighting methods of the Entente, lie then mentions that not only in the results of the subscriptions does the last loan surpass all the former loans, but also in the size and quickness of the payments, because as early as the first day of payment, instead of the 30 per cent, asked for, 12,710 millions   that is to say, over 80 per cent, of the total subscriptions had been paid in. Havenstein concluded : &quot; That is the clearest proof of our strong economic force, and of the healthy and good conditions of the German money market.&quot;Transition Economics.:-Cierman Wireless reports : In a programmatical, intro-ductpry speech regarding the Bill for the purpose of setting up Labour Chambers, the Secretary of State of the Imperial Economic Office, Baron von Stein, declared at a sitting of the Reichstag on May 1st, &quot; undeviating determination to win in the economic struggle also, does not lead us to suppose that the way to this victory will be any less thorny. In view of the declarations of the enemy, we must use all means available for this struggle. Economic development depends chiefly on the adjustment of the problem of the conditions of labour, and its solution will become increasingly imperative during the transitory period to peaceful economic conditions. The adjustment must take place so that the general welfare suffers no prejudice, and for this purpose the Labour Chambers will, be of service. The Bill presented in 1011 had for its object the maintenance of peace between employers and employed ; the present Bill takes up this matter and circumscribes that object, and it also deals especially with the care of the machinery for maintaining unity between the two.&quot; In the Reichstag debate on May 3rd regarding the Budget of the Imperial Economic Office, von Stein declared with, regard to the economic situation during the period of transition :-&quot; The State has every interest in seeing that small and average-sized industries are not crushed by war industries, and therefore State intervention must come about with the appearance of a lack of raw materials resulting from insufficient imports from abroad. War economics are also suffering under a scarcity of foreign products. If this should continue after the war, these undesirable phenomena, will automatically disappear as a result of greater imports of raw materials. So long as raw materials&quot; are not available in sufficient quantities, the State must intervene in the interests of small and aA-erage-sized industries.&quot; With regard to the threat of an economic war after the conclusion of peace, the Secretary of State warned the House against too great optimism, and declared : &quot; We must reckon upon this possibility and probability. End the war as it may, our enemies, as States and individuals, will not be desirous of entering into peaceful and friendly relations with us without further ado. I do not regard our enemies as old women, and when one is so often threatened with an economic war, 1 take it quite seriously. For this reason, we must prepare ourselves, during the transition period, with all means necessary to tide over this period. One must therefore organise the imports and exports to and from the country. Only if the State decided the matter will it be possible to struggle with endurance and success against such powerful enemies, who already on the battlefield .... and who are perhaps still -stronger in the economic field. I am firmly convinced that we shall retain the haft in our hands. It would be foolish to deceive one&apos;s self on the question that these times will be hard, and that here also the economic life of Germany must be exposed to restrictions if we are to keep our imports and exports in our own hands.&quot;
0171AUSTRIA-] I UNO A It V.Political Situation in Austria-liungary. The situation resulting from the recent changes at the Austrian Foreign Office is discussed as follows in the Daily Review (E.P.S.) of May 2nd : --&quot; Czernin, the day after his fall, found himself the hero of the german-Austrians, a vole to which he never in his diplomatic career put forward any very special claims. He had, however, for some time been looked upon as the pre-eminent champion of the German Alliance, and it was believed with hot resentment that he had been deprived of his post because of his recent attack on the Czechs in his reply to the Burgomaster of Vienna. The German parties, on hearing of his resignation, at once began to issue a stream of protests, the animus of which was directed against the Crown with a plainness unusual in Austria, while important towns like Salzburg, Reichenberg, and Marburg draped themselves in mourning, it was evidently believed that the Emperor had committed himself to a Slavophil policy and the appointment of Count Bolzer, the author of the amnesty, recently driven from his post of Chief of the Imperial Cabinet by German influences, to the position of Lord-Lieutenant of Lower Austria, served to increase this suspicion, winch was but little allayed by reassuring statements from Seidler and a declaration in the EmperoPs letter accepting Gzerniivs resignation, to the effect that his policy would remain unchanged. The nomination of Burian to the post vacated by Czernin complicated instead of clearing up the situation. If it was true, as the Germans supposed, that Czernin was dismissed for opposition to the claims of the Austrian Slavs, there appeared to be inconsistency in selecting &apos; Tisza&apos;s shadow &apos; to fill his place. There are, however, one or two tactical reasons that may help to explain it. Buriau was the obvious man to fill the difficult post of Foreign Minister in a sudden emergency, since he was OzernhPs predecessor at the Ballplatz. If (as seems possible from his retention of the Ministry of Joint Finance) he is only a stop-gap, he was a convenient stop-gap, especially as Charles was at Budapest during the crisis. Again, Buriaids identification with the Magyar policy of Tisza has not made him persona grata, with the Austrian Germans, who dislike seeing the affairs of the Monarchy managed from. Budapest, and regard Burian personally as an unsympathetic bureaucrat. The new Foreign Minister has a singularly bad Press from papers of every shade of Opinion, and thus his appointment at least serves to conceal the hand which the Emperor means to play. For the moment exasperation between Germans and. Slavs has again reached the highest point of tension. The Germans are bullying Seidler with a certain insolence, which reached its climax in a request that Austrian-German frontier populations should for food supply purposes be annexed to the administration of the German Empire.&quot; A Vienna telegram to the Swiss Press (May 2nd) states that after a discussion lasting six hours between the leaders of the German parties in the Northern Tyrol and the Premier, Dr. Seidler, it was agreed that the Northern Tyrol might, for provisioning purposes, be joined to Bavaria. Similarly the German districts of Northern Bohemia will be joined to Saxony.(See also the three succeeding paragraphs.)The Czecha-Slovak Movement,- The Foreign Office is informed that, though the Czecho-Sloyaks are stirring up agitation in Austria-Hungary, a revolution under present conditions is not to be expected, if the German offensive were to succeed, the Revolutionaries would be wiped out by methods similar to those employed by Turks against the Armenians. Any large movement must therefore wait until the control of Austria-Hungary is further weakened. Of the 52,000,000 people of which Austria-Hungary is composed, 32,000,000 are stated by informant to be active or passive friends of the Allies. These friends are capable of making the political and economic situation in Austria-Hungary more difficult, and are continuing to do so to an increasing extent. In the absence of a clear and unanimous lead from the Allies, they are unable to do more; though they are sufficiently strong to stop the Austro-PIungarian Government from taking active measures of repression. The Bohemians, the Jugo-Slavs and the Poles are acting in co-operation. The Czechs in Russia will take no part in Russian domestic conflicts, but will fight bitterly against anything that has a tinge of Germanism. On tire Italian front a situation, has already arisen in which the Ausfro-Hungarians dare not place Czech troops opposite the French and British, for fear of immediate and wholesale desertions. (The Foreign Office has received a report indicating that 5681-26 &apos; C -
the Austrian offensive against Italy is being delayed by the necessity of relegating to the rear uncertain Slav elements in the Austrian forces. It is added that the Hungarians, who thus find themselves selected for forward positions, are giving signs of discontent). With regard to the Austrian threat to transfer large numbers of Austrian Divisions to the French front, it is pointed out that any Czech troops so sent would at once desert in the same way to the Allies. Reliable Austrian troops could only be sent by taking them from Bohemia or other Austrian fronts. This would necessitate their replacement by German troops of second quality, which would turn Austria-Hungary into a German Province, a proceeding in which the Emperor Charles is not prepared to acquiesce.Austria-Hungary and Germany-A. report received by the Foreign Office asserts that if the Germans of   Austria and the Magyars of  Hungary   maintain   their predominance, the relations between Austria-Hungary and Germany will become closer.   On the other hand, the alliance would be weakened if there were a gain of political power on the part of the Socialists in Austria and of the Slav element in the Alonarchy, accompanied by an accretion of influence by the reactionaries in Germany. A parallel process of democratisation  in Glermany and Austria would intensify closeness of relations.    The Austrian Government bitterly resents German control of  its foreign  policy.    The  Foreign Office is informed that whereas Germany supported Bulgaria in ojrposition to OzerniAs policy at Bucharest, Turkey strongly supported Czernin, because she thought that the giving of Bessarabia to Rumania would preserve the balance of power in the Balkans, and act as a counterpoise to Bulgarian preponderance.     Differences with Germany and Hungary at Bucharest were the real cause of CzerniAs downfall, for which the Clemenceau revelations were only the pretext.   It. is also stated that Austria is bitter about Germany&apos;s determination to rectify the Bolish frontier in such a way as to include Dumbrowa mining district and   a good deal else.   The hostile attitude of  many   Austrian newspapers (especially the Arbeiter-Zeitung) towards Germany is reported to have been the subject of a formal complaint by the German Ambassador towards the end of Alarch.   A Vienna report to the Vossisclie Zeitung of May 4th states that the Austrian Parliament has been prorogued &quot; to enable us (the Austrians) to assist our Allies in the last phase of the war.   Parliamentary disagreements hampered the action of the Government andAiindered it in settling most vital economic questions.   As matters lie, a renewal of the discussions of the Imperial Council would in no way alleviate the position, but in all probability lead to acute;- political differences.&quot;   It may be noted in this connection that, according to the Schlesische Volks Wacht of the same date, the Austrian Consul-General at Breslau is calling up the Austrian Landsturm of the 1894- to 1899 classes.Austria, and, Hungary. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, the favourable economic conditions existing in Hungary and the economic frontier precautions taken by her to keep her food to herself, continue to excite the jealousy and irritation of Austria. Moreover, the Hungarian Cabinet exercises more influence than the Austrian Cabinet upon the Austro-Hungarian Government, and Hungarian influences operate in a disintegrating manner on the Dual Monarchy.Zionism in Austria. A Vienna telegram to the Jewish Correspondence Bureau (May 2nd) states that the Austrian authorities have closed all Zionist headquarters and meeting places in Cracow. In Vienna, the message adds, many Socialist Zionists, even young students, have been arrested, and the pro-ally Zionist Society there has been dissolved. The Jewish. Bress Bureau, at Stockholm (May 2nd.) announces that the Bolish Zionists are being systematically persecuted in Austria and Poland. Many. Zionists have been arrested in Vienna, whilst both existing Zionist organisations in Warsaw have been suppressed. Several Polish Zionists have been arrested and domiciliary searches have been carried out in Warsaw, Lemberg and Berlin. (See also Reports Nos. 58,.60, and 64- under &quot; Germany,&quot; and 66 under &quot; Austria.&quot;)Bolshevism. A. report received by the Foreign Office states that fear of Bolshevism, underlies Austria&apos;s continued search for peace.
11172NEUTRAL GROUP.ALBANIA.Austrian Pressure. Italian. Wireless of May 5th reports : &quot; Austria has ordered in ;all North Albania that there should be forced recruiting, with the object of sending Albanian troops against Italy. The Austrian command is carrying on an incessant propaganda to irritate the Albanian population not only against Italy but also against Montenegro. The Austrians lately contributed numerous decorations to the most hardened enemies of Montenegro.&quot;ARGENTINE RE PUBLIC.Argentine Proposals for Commercial Agreement with Allies. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading to inform the State Department that His Majesty&apos;s Government favours the conclusion of a Commercial Agreement as suggested by the Argentine Republic (see Report No. 62), and intends&apos; shortly to communicate to the Governments of France, Italy, and the United States its views upon the proposals made.Count Lnxhurg. Sir R. Tower has granted a safe conduct to Count Luxburg by the Suecia, of tire Swedish Johnson Line, sailing on May 8th for Sweden, via St. Thomas and Halifax.liailicay Strikes. Sir R. Tower reports that a serious situation has arisen in connection with the railway strikes (see Reports Nos. 65 and 66), the British companies differing with the President of the Republic regarding reinstatement of discharged men.DENMARK.Danish Socialists and Germany. -The Foreign Office is informed that in 1915 Wilhelm Jansson, editor of the Correspondenz Blalt, the organ of the German Trade Unions, was sent by the German Government to make propaganda in Scandinavia. In Christiania, Stockholm and Gothenburg he gave lectures on German Social. Democracy. In Denmark he had numerous interviews with the leaders of the Social Democratic Party, to whom he pointed out the regret felt in Germany, at the hostile attitude of the Danish Bourgeois Bress. After declaring that Danish hostility was comprehensible in view of the loss of Danish territory in .186.1, he stated that this territory might be recovered if Germany were com-pensated with Iceland and the Faroe Islands, or at least the latter. This proposal was repeated in 191.7 by the German agent, Dr. Helphand (or Parvus). Pro in this it seems clear, first, that the German Socialists have consistently endeavoured to forward the German programme of annexation; secondly, that Germany has wide ambitions for naval positions in the Atlantic (evidenced also by the German-Finnish thrust towards the Russian coast), and that these ambitions .aim at the destruction, in this or a subsequent war, of British sea power. There are stated to be indications that the Danish Socialist leaders are preparing the ground for this transaction by encouraging Icelandic claims for independence (see also Reports Nos. 50 aird 5.4 and next paragraph).Iceland : German Propaganda. Sir R. Baget reports that under pressure from the German Legation in Copenhagen, Ritzahs Bureau has reproduced an article from the Vossische Zeitung, which declares that fear is felt in Denmark that Iceland may break --away and declare itself an independent Republic.   It is there indicated that Iceland
is subject to very strong British influence, which systematically suppresses everything Danish in the island ; that pro-British feelings are stimulated by large payments of money; that the British Consul is the real Governor; and that later on the island will, as a Republic, throw in its lot with the United Kingdom.[The Independent Social Democratic organ Dags Ekko of May 4th publishes an interview7 with a &quot;prominent Icelander,&quot; who states that in .1.916 the Germans offered to assist in the establishment of a saltpetre factory and a new railway in Iceland,, with a view to obtaining a submarine base or some similar concession in return.]FINLAND and ALAND.General Situation. The Foreign Office learns that on April 10th and 1.1th most of the Russian fleet and transports left Helsingfors for Kronstadt. The Germans entered Helsingfors on April. 12th after severe fighting and a good deal of damage to the town. On April 14th General von der Goltz made an official entry. Numerous. German flags were hoisted and there was considerable fraternisation of Germans and Finns. Upwards of 7,000 Red prisoners were sent to Sveaborg. The German Commander-in-Chief ordered all foreign subjects to report to the local German command ; this order was not obeyed by the British and French, who, after conferring-with Finnish Senators, consented to report to the Finnish Provincial Governor, who informed them that he Avon Id be glad if they would leave Helsingfors ; that passes could only be granted by the German Commandant, but that the Finnish Authorities-would not obstruct anybody avIio cared to leave at his own. risk. On April 18th the Entente Consuls. were asked the number of their nationals and the length of time during which they could supply themselves with food. In giving these particulars the Consuls pointed out the possibility of reprisals in the British Empire and France. His Majesty&apos;s Consul had stored certain British Government supplies under Consular seals ; these seals the Germans broke and made a. list of the supplies. (The Foreign Office has instructed Sir E. Howard to protest to the Finnish Govern-ment against this-violation of its guarantee of Consular immunity. Sec Report No. 64.) On or before April 25th the Finnish Authorities at Helsingfors. upon German instigation, placed an embargo and a guard upon five Danish steamers chartered to the bed Cross. Most of the military stores left bythe Russians were sent in enemy transports to Germany. On May 1st the German Fleet was under orders to leave. On May 4th the Germans reported the capture of 20,000 prisoners and thousands of horses and vehicles. It is reported that, with the approval of the White Government, 25,000 Red prisoners are being sent to Germany as a labour contingent. The Swedish Aftonbladet of May 5th published a letter from Finland, stating that the German General Staff there considered their military expedition as practically concluded. Compulsory military service has been intro-duced for all Finns from 21 to 45 years of age. From a report received by the Foreign Office, it appears that in the operations against Helsingfors the Germans attacked under cover of prisoners, and that, their general treatment of prisoners Avas very brutal. There -is evidence of -an abatement, in responsible Finnish quarters, of the enthusiasm originally felt at German intervention; and the credit given to the Germans by certain -sections is felt to be excessive^ and likely to lead to further subservience. A strong monarchical movement appears to be on foot, and according to the Swedish Id-ess, the Crown is likely to be offered, to Duke Adolf Fried rich, of Mecklenberg-Schweriu. (It is improbable that this German candidature will be much appreciated in Sweden.) Meanwhile, the Finnish authorities are making difficulties at the non-recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of Finlamhs independence ; His Majesty&apos;s Consul has pointed out that German occupation would appear to be inconsistent with such recognition. President Swinhufvud is reported to be sincerely determined to maintain neutrality, though the Finnish Press has recently been hinting at war with Great Britain.Finland and Eastern Karelia. ddie Foreign Office is informed that the Finnish Government still contemplates the acquisition of Karelia, justifying such a step on both ethnographical and strategical grounds. Probably no official expedition would be sent, but the Government might not see its way to prevent a volunteer force going to the assistance of the local Finns against the Bolshevists.   According to a report
of May 4th. an armed force of Wkite Finns under German officers is expected to march on Pechanga, in Russian territory, along the Norwegian frontier from Ohaluiozero. Red Guards have been sent to protect the town, and a small Norwegian gttardship has arrived at Kirkehes to watch Norwegian interests.Aland. The Swedish -Press announces that half of the Swedish force in Aland returned to Sweden on May 3rd, and that the remainder will return on May Kith, after completing the inventory of Russian stores.MENICO.&quot;&quot;Unsettled- Conditions. The Foreign Office learns that Caballero has recently sustained a defeat, and that Pelaez at present shows no disposition to co-operate with him.   (And see Report.No. fib..   A. force of 600 rebels has pillaged. Minaiitl.au.Proposed Taxation on Petroleum. Sir W.* Townley reports that the Netherlands Government is lodging a protest against the new taxation on petroleum proposed by the Mexican Government (and see Reports Nos. 53 and 66).NETHERLANDS.Netherlands and Germany. Sir W. Townley reports that the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs lias sent the following written statement to both Chambers of the States General: &quot; The tension (see Reports Nos. 65 and 66) which has existed for a time between the Netherlands nnd Germany is over. The German Government has desired of the Netherlands Government certain measures which, in their original form, were only partly capable of being complied with.   The measures are the following :  &quot;(1) Resumption of conveyance in. transit of sand, gravel and broken stone from Germany to Belgium, discontinued since November 15th, 1917, without maintenance by the Netherlands Government of the condition, made by it that a commission of experts should previously make investigation in Belgium as to the use which had been made of material formerly conveyed in transit. The Netherlands Government was at once opposed to such transit in. unlimited quantities without control, as such would be contrary to its well-known view of the duties of neutrality. The German Government thereupon itself indicated a maximum figure for quantities to be granted, namely, 1,600,000 tons per year. This removes for the Netherlands Government the objection of principle it had raised, for the said figure was below the maximum it had fixed in its correspondence with the two Governments concerned as required, in their opinion., for the ordinary upkeep and repair of Belgian reads. It is therefore able without preponderant objection to drop the condition made by it in the last instance, that a Commission of Control should be admitted into Belgium before transit could be resumed, a condition which the German Government has now declared, to be unacceptable. The Netherlands Government has been able to accept this arrange-merit the more readily because at its request the German Government has declared it is prepared to lay down explicitly in notes to be exchanged that the materials to be conveyed in transit will not be used for military works.&quot; (2) Unobstructed export of gravel from Netherlands to Belgium to the maximum of 250,000 tons per month. In consequence of the transport prohibition recently issued in the Netherlands, the export of sand and gravel otherwise free was rendered, very difficult. The Netherlands Government has no reason to oppose on any ground of principle compliance with this wish, concerning a product of the Netherlands soil not subject to any export prohibition.&quot; (3) The&apos; resumption of goods traffic by railroad, between Belgium and Germany via Roermond, stopped, by the German Government itself at the commencement of war. No objection can be raised, from the Netherlands side against such resumption, because in virtue of the Treaty with Germany of November 13th, 1874, the Nether-lands are bound to render such railway traffic possible. The German Government desires free transit via that railway of all goods with three exceptions, namely, aircraft, weapons and ammunition ; there is no question of the transport of troops. On the ground of a principle of International Law laid down explicitly in Article 2 of their proclamation of neutrality, the Netherlands Government cannot allow any transit of arm)7 provisions. It therefore informed the German Government that t-his fourth exception is positively required for admissibility of the transit traffic desired.   The5681-21. 1)
German Government lias now declared that it agrees to the restrictions of transit traffic thus imposed. It also states that it agrees with the description given by the Netherlands Government of the term weapons as comprising all objects of armament and equipment.&quot; (4) The simplification and acceleration of measures taken by the Netherlands Government for repressing fraudulent export on board Rhine vessels leaving the country or proceeding in transit, as in the German Governments opinion &quot;those measures considerably obstruct the free navigation guaranteed by the Rhine Navigation Act. The Netherlands Government itself, convinced of the desirability, has undertaken to do its utmost to remove the obstructions objected to, for instance, by sealing at the time of loading in Germany under the supervision of a Netherlands official, by guarding on board, and. by rapid clearance outwards, all this without relinquishing in the least its contractual right of control. On this point it is still exchanging views with the Government at Berlin.&quot; Finally the German Government has withdrawn, on being urged by the Nether-lands Government to do so, its objections to the instructions furnished by the Netherlands Government to its Consular Officers in Belgium in virtue of which, in respect of goods to be exported or conveyed in transit from that country, the certificate that they are not military supplies, booty, or requisitioned goods, may not be issued in respect of goods which are subject to a regime equal to requisition. The German Government admits that these instructions have not given rise to complaints.&quot;Sir W. Townley points out that the first concession constitutes the Netherlands Government sole arbiter of the quantities of sand and gravel required in Belgium for civil purposes, and that the third does not specifically preclude the passage of fodder over the Roermond Railway or afford satisfactory safeguards regarding the transit of military stores generally.Customs Supervision of Passenger Traffic.  Sir W. Townley reports that in response to German demands (see Report No. 65) the Netherlands Government has instructed Customs officers not to deprive travellers (except those crossing the frontier continually) of new clothes, unless they are wearing double sets or the articles clearly do not form part of their wardrobe.Dutch East Indian Embargo. The Foreign Office learns that tin, quinine, kapolc, and possibly also petroleum have been prohibited for export, except under licence, from the Dutch East Indies. The position created is under consideration by the British and United. States Governments (see also under &quot;United States &quot;).NORWAY.Norwegian-American Agreement. Lord Reading reports the signature ad referendum, on April 30th of the Norwegian-American Agreement, particulars of which will be given in the next issue of this Report.Purchases of English and American Notes. Sir M. Findiay draws attention to the continuance of high offers for English and American banknotes, and submits that in view of the probability of their acquisition for enemy purposes further export should be prohibited. (See also Reports - Nos. -60, (12-65 under &quot;Netherlands,&quot; &quot;Norway&quot; or &quot; Switzerland.&quot;)Pyritesi-Sir M. Findiay reports that enemy agents are offering 2 crowns per unit of sulphur for pyrites, to be stored in Norway till after the Avar. It has been pointed out that, after wool and cotton, there can hardly be any commodity more desirable to control than pyrites. His Majesty&apos;s Government is taking appropriate action in the matter.   (See Memoranda OPT. 4124 and 1436, and Reports Nos. 57, 59 and. 62.)SPAIN.General Situation.   The situation is reported to be at, present quiet, but the pressing economic difficulties are far from solution. Protests and petitions continue to pour in from all quarters, and much criticism is levelled against the commercial agreements with the Allies, which up to the present are not considered to have been of any benefit. Food and coal are now under official control, and local committees have been established throughout  the country to regularise the
&quot;distribution of. imports. The obstacles placed by the Germans in the way of maritime transport are causing profound, disgust. The service of the Transatlantic Line, which Avas interrupted by German submarines on the ground that contraband Avas being carried, is now normal ; but there is no doubt that the shipowners have been, scared. Wheat is scarce throughout Spain ; thexshortage of nitrates in. Valencia will be fatal to the rice crop, and a large proportion of the poorer classes will be reduced to starvation. In the event of the present Ministry failing to hold together or failing to solve these problems, it is difficult to see what combination could succeed them.Enemy Financial Activity. The Publicidad (April 19th) publishes the following article on operations recently engineered by Germans on the Barcelona Stock Exchanges :--&quot; During the past fortnight marked fluctuations have occurred on the Barcelona market in the price of the three principal currencies quoted, namely, francs, pounds sterling, and dollars. These fluctuations are so significant that we have con-siclered it worth While to explain what has happened, in order to obviate any unfavourable impression which may be produced by these quotations. For a long time, owing to the cessation of imports, rendering Spain an exporting country only, the sole set-off for the Spanish market Avas the import of gold from America and of Spanish securities domiciled in Paris. To this succeeded a state of speculation arising under coA*er of the facilities granted by foreign banks, which credit with interest current accounts in. francs and pounds. This proceeding facilitated operations for the account in Barcelona and Madrid, analogous to those usually adopted in the case of public funds and industrial stocksi Certain important firms, in anticipation.of the Coiwention with the Allies coming into force, bad acquired francs, pounds, and dollars, to cover the eventual purchase of raw materials. These acquisitions, together with speculation by those seeking to benefit by a possible rise in the exchange, created a bull position. Barcelona founded its optimism and hopes on the conclusion of the Conventions and the success of tlie Allies&apos; aims. The impatience of buyers due to the delay in. forming the arrangements and combines indispensable to the proper working of our commerce and industry, induced a state of nervousness in the markets. Naturally the bears Avere watching for a favourable moment for unloading foreign money. They kneAV the date of settlement of a large number of credit transactions. From the beginning of the German offensive the bears brought into play ail the means at their disposal. They sacrificed certain bills sold at a loss, and made use of tendoncious information to frighten the over-bold ; for instance, on the 1.3th of this month (April), when from the very precincts of the Bank of Spain, they circulated the report that a revolution had broken, out in France. The low rate of exchange ruling on Monday last (April 15th) Avas the consequence of the struggle between the parties, inasmuch as the offers indicated&apos;a German origin. It was an orthodox Stock Exchange offensive. It is quite logical that importers, impatient with the irresolute attitude of the Government, should have disposed of their purchases and influenced speculators. To the unsettled situation caused by the recent commotion, due to certain banking concerns desirous of co-operating in the triumph of Germany, has succeeded a more regular one produced by purchases in cash. The market has felt considerable relief. Those who are bears for a given, object are watching the opportunity of causing fresh disturbances. Be it said in passing that during these days the Mk. 100 have been quoted at the nominal, rate of 96 and 97 pesetas &quot; (and see Report No. 66).German Submarine Campaign and Spanish Shipping Circles.--The Dally Review of May 3rd refers as follows to the effect of the German submarine campaign (combined perhaps with propaganda) upon Spanish shipping circles : &quot; Whether spontaneous or artificially fomented, the alarm inspired in shipowners and seamen by the submarine is distinctly on. the increase, to judge by the petitions addressed to the Government from various quarters.&quot;First, we haAre a deputation of members of the Chamber representing the province of Biscay, which informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sr. Dato) that the United States Government only permitted, the sailing of Spanish vessels from American ports ou condition that they should return with Spanish products. Certain shipping firms, added the deputation, were unwilling to expose their vessels to. the perils of another voyage, and asked the Government to commandeer these ships so as to render the voyage impossible. (Jm.pavcl.al, April 18thj. Next comes a telegram, from the Corporation for the Protection of the Spanish.
Merchant Service and the Association of Masters and Mates petitioning the Govern-rnent, in view of their natural alarm at the steady reduction of the national merchant fleet and consequent injury to seamen, &quot;who will soon he thrown out of work, to prohibit the more dangerous voyages for so long as the Government is unable to safeguard national tonnage and the lives of the sailors, much, more important than shippers&apos; interest,   (Vangitardia, April 22nd.) &quot;SWEDEN. -   .Political Situation. In a Memorandum (G.T. 1451), dated May 3rd, the Political Intelligence Department observes that in spite of the Swedish Governments judicious handling of the Finland and Aland questions, there remains an undercurrent of dissatisfaction, amongst the generality of Swedes, who feel their prestige to have been affected. Pet, concerned and annoyed, though they are at the German domination of Finland, they feel that it has at least suppressed Bolshevism, which was seriously alarming their characteristic love of law and order. Though, there is a noisy Pro-German minority, the greater part of the population is tacitly pro-Ally. A successful termination of the negotiations between the United States and the present well-disposed Liberal-Socialist Government would strengthen the position of the latter in the country.Economic. Situation. The Minister of Finance, M. Thorssen, speaking at Ystad on. May 1st, said : &quot; The Government is seeking by all means in its power to obtain food for our people, who are literally fighting against starvation. Our agreement with the Entente Powers ensures that in return for the hiring out of 400,000 tons of shipping now lying in foreign harbours, we shall obtain. 250,000 tons of corn and 300,000 tons of foodstuffs, in addition to lubricating oil, cotton, rice, sugar, molasses, and other vital necessities. It is unjust to the nation that certain interests should be-so entirely guided by economic calculations as to wink at the danger of starvation. The opposition which some Swedes seek to arouse against the Tonnage and Import Agreement finds its reflex in the increased demands from the south, and increases difficulties when the Government is seeking to obtain guarantees that goods to be; imported shall not miscarry en route. If the Import Agreement be overthrown, our difficulties will multiply in the coming year, and the demands on the population will become greater. The social machinery which is fed by the Treasury could not bear the many new burdens which &quot;would then be put on it, The main thing is to get bread-the price is a secondary consideration. The import of coal is an example of the shortage we are now fighting against, and the price of which oppresses us. Our normal import of coal, was 5,000,000 tons, which cost Kr. 75 to.Fr. 100 million. Last year two and a half million tons were imported, and the price paid was Kr. 375,000,000 ; that meant that we had to deliver goods to that amount. In addition, foreign countries made a loan a condition of the export of their goods. For coal, Germany exacts a loan from Sweden of Kr. 6,000,000 monthly. The price of the mark sank, and accordingly Germany wants to help that out fry loans. In other words, a loan from Sweden is exacted for the payment of goods from &apos; Sweden. Our claims abroad amount to about Kr. 1 milliard, and before the war we owed foreign countries Kr. 1 milliard, of which .about three hundred millions have been paid off. But the forty to fifty millions of yearly income from abroad which were used in railway construction, and in the building of canals and other means of communication, have failed. We have thus had to strain our resources to the utmost. The putting together of these figures will show one of the principal reasons which have contributed to our increased note currency and money depreciation.&quot;May 1st. Sir E. Howard reports that May 1st passed off quietly all over Sweden. There were workmeAs demonstrations in all the large towns, but these were of a perfectly orderly character, and most of the Socialist speakers urged that this was not a suitable time for mass action by the proletariat, as such action could not produce more food, but. might lead to disaster as in Russia and Finland.SWITZERLAND.Wood and Agricidtural Products Agreement. Sir II. Rumbold reports that the agreement regarding - Swiss wood and agricultural products (see Report No. 66) was signed on May 1st by the Swiss and Allied delegates.
Swiss-German Negotiations. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the Swiss Government is now likely to demand coal from the Germans in compensation for the li3Tdro-electric energy supplied to them by Switzerland. The French Government is prepared to supply the balance of Swiss coal requireriients. In this way German pressure would be nullified (and see Report No. 06).Internal Conditions. In a despatch dated April 16th, Sir Id. Rumbold outlines the causes of the unrest existing in Switzerland since the Zurich riots of last November. The expulsion of a Socialist German deserter, the question of the civil mobilisation of -conscientious objectors, and the suppression of an anarchist newspaper have in turn been, made pretexts for agitation by Swiss labour, which finds itself in an abnormal, state owing to the excessive length of the war. The authorities have lately had to raise the official price of milk, largely in order to encourage production, and the Swiss Socialist Executive has threatened that unless the working classes at large are relieved by the State of the extra charge, they will proclaim a general strike, ddie Federal Council is divided on this question, which has swept into its train much of the traditional rivalry between French and German Switzerland, although the line of division is being complicated by the cross cleavage between the stalwart indi-vidualists of the old school and the adherents of the rising doctrine of State Socialism. The most immediate result will probably be to deprive the Federal Council of the plenary powers they have enjoyed since the outbreak of war. Meanwhile the Federal Council has transferred the matter to the National Council for decision. There is reason to believe that the labour unrest is fomented by German agitators. Idle Swiss Press foreshadows that should the double price demanded by Germany for coal be -agreed to by the Swiss Government, the extremists will demand that this difference also shall be borne by the State.King Conslantine. Sir II. Rumbold learns that the German Government has instructed a Zurich firm to open a credit of several millions of francs in favour of King Cons tan tine, for the purpose of enabling him to stir up trouble in Greece ; large sums have already been drawn out by the King.Enemy Intrigue. Sir Id. Rumbold learns that the principal members of the Italian Zimmerwaldists were arrested on April 26th at Zurich. Evidence has been discovered proving their complicity in a bomb affair designed by a well-known Austrian agent (see lie-port No. 66).PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. ddie most important information this week points to the probability that the peace discussions between the Germans and Russians have resulted in the seizure by the Germans of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and the entry of Turkish war vessels under German control into Sebastopol harbour, ddie subject has thus passed beyond the scope of this Report.- Russian Wireless messages of May 7th seem to indicate similar German designs to seize.the Russian Baltic Fleet.Mr. Lockhart on May 7th reported on very good authority that the whole of the Brest Treaty was drafted by the Germans, and the Russians were compelled to sign it.
