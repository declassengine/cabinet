&quot;PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.GENERAL.Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing-ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period June 7th-13th inclusive, was 102,961 tons gross, of which 68,421 were British, as compared with 73,309 tons gross, of which 31,461 were British, reported last week.Par East. The Foreign Office is informed that the administration at Irkutsk and Vladivostock is now entirely in the hands ot ex-convicts. The Bolshevists have been sending shells from Vladivostock for employment against Semenoff. The latter, in his latest action, captured German prisoners, who were at once shot, On June 9th rail communication was cut both East and West of Semenoff to prevent his reinforcement. Tn these circumstances 200 Japanese volunteers were permitted by the Japanese General Staff to join him. The Japanese Military Authorities are determined to intervene without waiting for an Allied mandate, if Japanese interests are menaced. An anti-Bolshevist rising is being prepared in vladivostock, of which the Japanese have knowledge. The Czech troops control large portions of the Siberia railway, and seem determined to fight their way East rather than to proceed to Vladivostock. They have disbanded their National Council as being too conciliatory towards the Bolshevists, whose hostility continues. The Allied Representatives have protested to the Bolshevist Government against such treatment of Allied forces ; the Bolshevists are apprehensive that the Czecho-Slovak question may seriously affect their own position, as encouraging counter-revolutions throughout Siberia (see. Russian Wireless of June 12th- 16th): The risings against the Bolshevists are not, however, provoked by the Czecho-Slovaks, but undertaken from a confidence inspired by their presence. This applies, generally speaking, throughout Siberia, where Allied intervention would be welcomed by all except the Bolshevists. Meanwhile, the Germans are spending large sums with a view to a pro-German reactionary movement in anticipation of Allied encouragement of a non-party democratic rally.S.S. &quot; Kuningin Regentes.&quot; Sir W. Townley learns that the Netherlands Naval Authorities appear to be convinced, upon the evidence&apos; submitted, that the S.S. Konivgin Regentes (see Report No. 72) was torpedoed. The Germans have expressed dissatisfaction with the findings, and a tug was to leave on June 17th to carry out diving operations on the scene .of the wreck. As the Germans asked and obtained leave for an interned German Naval, officer to be present, similar permission was obtained for the presence of a British officer. Sir W. Townley transmits a request by the shipping companies concerned that the route from the British coast to the place of the disaster should be swept by His Majesty&apos;s Navy, to obviate any possibility of mines.German Neglect of British Wounded. The Foreign Office instructs the British Delegates at The Hague as to numerous cases in which wounded British prisoners captured ill the recent offensive have died owing to the grave neglect of the German authorities.. German, Prisoners in England. German Wireless of June 15th reports some &quot; unvarnished truths &quot; told by an escaped German officer regarding the &quot; revolting treatment&quot; of German prisoners in England. His complaints include the statement that &quot;at times we are absolutely starving since it is impossible to make the food do with which we are supplied.&quot; German Wireless attributes this state of affairs to the submarine campaign.Austro-Serbian Prisoners Agreement. The Foreign Office is informed of an Austria-Serbian Agreement recently signed, at Berne, for exchange of valid and repatriation of invalid prisoners. This agreement, is to be ratified on or before July 13th. Serbia will have a slight numerical advantage in the exchange. There is a clause (inserted in favour of Jugo-Slavs) against involuntary repatriation.
o oAllied Food Supply. Lord Reading reports that Mr. Hoover -will shortly visit Europe, to consult with-the Allied Food Administrators regarding the food programmes for nextyehr, and to study the possibilities of closer co-ordination in production, transport and supply.Interallied Munitions Council.  A. Memorandum (G.T. 4811), dated June Sth; reports the&apos;organisation of an Interallied Munitions Council.Interallied Programme Committees. The Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading to invite the United States Government to accept the principle of Programme Com-mittees already adopted by the European Allies (see Report No. (59) and to nominate representatives.ALLIED  GROUP.BELGIUM.M. Gooreman. M. Cooreman, the new Belgian Prime Minister, is Catholic Deputy for Ghent and enjoys great popularity among the members of his party. He has had political experience, both as Minister of Labour and as President of the Chamber of Deputies. He is a man of moderate views and conciliatory to his opponents. It is thought that he will do well as President of a Cabinet composed of Catholics, Liberals, and Socialists.German Propaganda in Switzerland regarding Flemish Movement, The Berner Tagblalt, which is under German control, publishes (June 15th) a statement, also appearing in the Muneherler Neueste Nachrichten, alleged to have been made by a Fleming, that by agreement between the British and Belgian Governments, British Military Police are to occupy Belgium for 18 months after the conclusion of peace, as the Belgian Government is afraid that, owing to Flemish discontent, there will be a revolution on its return to Belgium. Sir F. Villiers reports that the Belgian Government has already contradicted this story and authorised its Minister at Berne to do the same.   (And see Reports Nos. 52 , 54 , 59, (55 , 70, and. 72.)Germany and Belgian Railways. The Kolnische Zeitung (May 29th) publishes, under the heading &quot; The Iron Rhine,&quot; a communication on the necessity for retention of the Belgian railways by Germany after the war. Belgium and Germany are economically interdependent. The railways from the south-west to the Schelde, and the railway from Cologne, via Aachen, Luttich, and Brussels to the coast the &quot; Iron.Rhine &quot; as it was called mean for Germany connection with the open sea and. the world-market. The goods exchanged annually and transported by railway between Belgium and Germany amount to from 8 to 9 million tons, but the goods going through from Germany to Belgian seaports amount alone to 2-J- to 8 million tons almost one-third of the German-Belgian railway traffic. There is also the important river and canal means of transport. On the Rhine alone the German-Belgian traffic amounts to from 8 to 9 million tons yearly. Germany would be surrendering herself if she allowed the door to the open sea to be closed against, her by giving np the key to a declared enemy. It is only the inevitable conclusion drawn from the attitude and menace of our enemies if it is demanded that the Belgian railways and ports must remain in German hands or under German influence. In what form this shall be effected may be left to the&apos; consideration of responsible ^quarters. We do not wish to take anything away from the Belgian people. On the contrary, we are of opinion that it is only with the support of, and in connection with, Germany, that Belgiuuds means of communication can be perfected and made better than they were before the Avar. Germany has built fresh lines during the Avar, thus providing for pressing needs which the Belgian State Railways, Avith their limited resources, could not supply. &quot;There can be no talk of our surrendering here&apos;, what avc have created Avith great sacrifice.&quot; Even before the Avar the State Railways -were fi.nancialljr weak and in need of neAv material. Belgium cannot, without external help, restore her system.   If the work is not done by Germany, the Belgian railways will
certainty fall a prey to English and American capital. These are not, mere forebodings. We hear that a Belgian Commission, has already been concerning itself in America with the conclusion of contracts for the supply of railway material. How will the Government, without a country pay for these purchases ? This report fits in with another, that the United States have acquired a mortgage on the Belgian railways. This means that the competitor, who will perhaps be our most dangerous future rival, in the world-marker, is establishing himself at the gate which formerly stood open to us on to the free world-market. If we acquiesce, the effect on Holland can be foreseen. In the long-run we should be thrown back on our German North Sea ports, so far removed from the ocean. Germany would no longer have any sea-power. (And see Reports Nos. 62-64, and 71.)BRAZIL.Projected Elimination of German Trade, Sir A. Reel reports that the .Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for finance are both in favour of liquidating German firms in Brazil which have their head office in Germany. [Hie. Minister of Finance is stated to have recommended this policy to the President of the Republic.   (And see Reports Nos. 69 and 71.)(And see under &quot; Chile.&quot;)CHINA.Reported Japanese Loan Negotiations. -In connection with the rumoured negotiations for a Japanese loan to China (see Reports Nos. 69-72) the Foreign Office has authorised Sir J. Jordan to make representations, if necessary, regarding the position of the British-American Tobacco Company and to inform the Chinese Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government is opposed to the creation of any monopoly in favour of a foreign company.Attacks on British Subjects. Sir J. Jordan reports that owing to various cases of unprovoked, assault upon British subjects, especially in the provinces of Szechuah and Hunan, he has arranged for a British warship to patrol the Gliekiang coast in search, of pirates.Enemy Aliens. Sir J. Jordan emphasises the damaging effect upon Allied.&quot; prestige of suspending-the deportation of enemy aliens from China (see Report No. 72), and suggests their repatriation as an. (unsatisfactory) alternative. It is-clear that Germans in China were fully aware of the projected measure and were awaiting completion of negotiations in Europe for abolition, of deportation. German . Wireless of June f 5th announces that &quot;the danger of deportation for the Germans in China has been averted for the time being by a threat of measures of retaliation. (it is stated at the same time that the German Government will in the negotiations at The Plague demand the liberation of Germans deported to India from Siain). The Foreign Office has instructed Sir J. Jordan to point out to the Chinese Govern-ment the irrelevance of the Franco-German Agreement to the questions of the deportation from or internment in China of enemy aliens.Sino-Japanese Agreement. Sir G. Greene reports that he lias been referred for the terms of the Sino-Japanese Agreement by the Japanese Foreign Office to the General Staff, which in turn stated that the Agreement contained no further particulars than had been published in the Press. An understanding had been reached, for joint,, action in certain circumstances, but the nature of such action, and the circumstances themselves, had not been decided.FRANCE.The Debate on the Military Situation. In a despatch dated June 5th, Lord Derby describes the Debate on June 4th upon the military situation, -when M. Clemenceau,.
though subjected to noisy interruptions, secured a vote of confidence by a large majority (see Report No. 71). Tlie various speakers and interrupters declared that their only motive was a desire to promote the real interests of the country, but that they : did not consider that this implied a concurrence in all M. clemenceau did. Many Deputies who voted for the Government probably did so from a conviction that the time was inopportune for a change of Ministry and that there was no one fitted at such a moment to take M. Clemenceau&apos;s place. Among the 85 Socialists who voted against the Government were MM. Albert Thomas, Jean I .onguet, Ren aud el, Sembat and Yarenne. M. Franklin Bouillon, Radical Socialist, and M Thomson, Republican of the Left, formerly Minister of Marine, were among the 16 Deputies who abstained from voting.French. Merehaitt Seamen and the Subinaruie War. Replying to an appeal from Mr. Havelock Wilson, the General President of the National Seamenls Union, M. Riveili, the Secretary of the French. Shipping Federation, writes to- the Matin (June.9th) : &quot;Mr. Havelock Wilson asks whether we are ready, together with our British confreres, to take measures for the punishment,of Austrian and Gerhian sailors for their crimes. Our reply is that the question is settled by the decisions unani-mously arrived at by the sailors of Great Britain, Italy, Russia, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Denmark, aud France at the Congress held in August 1917. Those decisions still remain our charter of future action comprising : &quot; (!) An indignant protest against the atrocities of U-boats, whose crews will lieheld responsible. &quot; (2) If necessary, a refusal to sail with them after the Avar.&quot; (3) The withdrawal of our shipping unions and organisations from the Inter-national Transport Federation, and the establishment of an International Executive Committee of Allied and Neutral Seamen.&quot;M. Riveili adds that the French National. Shipping Federation has decided to translate aud publish in French the report of the proceedings of the said Congress, which will appear in pamphlet form in the course of a few days. The Llberte (dune 9th), under the heading of &quot;The Sailors&apos; Law,&quot; writes :: &apos;* The English sailors have taken an irrevocable resolution to boycott the Germans for seven years after the war. They will refuse to work or to sail in the same ships with Germans or to carry any merchandise by ship to German ports. They Will do wdiat they have decided because they are free men and because they are sailors to the backbone with, all the virtues of that race. To-day the sailors of France announce, through the Secretary of their Federation the famous M. Rivelli that they adhere to the resolution of their British confreres. To-morrow the sailors of all the free nations will reconstitute without the Germans, and against the Germans, an international society of the sea, which will at the same time comprise an international sea law.&quot; (See also under &quot;-Nor-w-ay.&quot;)ITALY.Tlie Austrian Offensive. Italian Wireless of June 17 th reports: &quot; Yesterday&apos;s Session of the Chamber was an admirable page in Italy&apos;s political history during the war. A moving welcome was given to the War Minister, whose praise of the admirable resistance of the army was cheered by the entire Chamber, and was soon reported all over the country, provoking last night demonstrations in many Italian cities. The entire Press comments upon it. The leader of the Socialists described it as a noble statement of patriotism and of the concord which prevails amongst all parties for resistance until, victory is obtained. Gratification is felt that the Premier gave fuller play to the declaration regarding Italy&apos;s solidarity with Austrkis oppressed nationalities, saying that it is useless to specify our diplomatic attitude towards these people whilst C/echo-Slovak Italians, after being reviewed by the Sovereign, light side by side with our soldiers and whilst Rumanians and Jugo-Slavs beg to be allowed to join us against the common enemy. The Speech was heartily applauded. Another noteworthy fact in yesterday&apos;s sitting was Orlando&apos;s statement that the Centra&quot;! Powers have never offered honourable peace terms. By 2S2 votes against 34 full confidence was expressed in the Government. In the 34 against were Socialists whose vote after the statement of their leader has a purely political meaning in 3-reference to the  Government.&quot;    According to a report received by the Foreign
Office tlie Emperor Charles at his recent meeting with the Kaiser agreed to an immediate offensive against Italy. This was opposed by the A astro-Hungarian Generals in command on the ground that the troops were under-rationed, and that it would not be -possible to maintain supplies at a proper level if an attack were begun. The Foreign Office is further informed that the Austrian offensive has been hitherto delayed because the Central Powers contemplated a strong peace offensive in Italy in the hope of detaching her from the Allies. This peace offensive was not to start until the Germans had. intimidated Italy by their successes on the&apos; Western Front. Moreover, the German Government had no confidence in the power of the Austrians to undertake a military offensive unless strongly reinforced by German troops. There is reason to believe that the Central. Powers decided towards the end of Alay that the time had come to offer peace terms to Italy ; it is not known whether a definite offer lias yet been made.   (See also Reports Nos. 69 and 72.)War Contribution from Italians in the, Argentine. Italian Wireless of June .12th reports : &quot; Italians living in South America have given full proof of their devotion to the Motherland on the occasion of the latest war loan. Compatriots living in the Argentine Republic have subscribed an additional 14(3,000,000 lire, thus surpassing all expectations. It was not thought that they could contribute over 30,000,000 lire, considering their small number.&quot;Enemy Propaganda. Sir E. Howard emphatically contradicts a tenclencious fabrication published in the Vienna Reichsposi of June 8th to the effect that the British Legation in Stockholm has announced that the object of the Entente is to detach Austria from Germany by sacrificing Italian claims.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Projected Executive Commission to Europe. The Foreign Office learns that there is a probability of a Commission being sent by the United States Government to Europe;with full executive powers in relation to certain war questions, ft is stated, that the Commission is likely to be headed by Mr. Vance MacCormick or Mr. Hoover, with Mr. Crosby to deal with Finance and Mr. Stettinius with Military matters.Shipbuilding Programme. According to the New York Times (June 11th), Mr. Hurley, Chairman of the Shipping Board, in the course of an address at South Bend, Indiana, declared (June 10th) that by 1920 American shipbuilding would aggregate 2,1.0.1. vessels of over .14,000,000 deadweight tonnage. &quot; The amount of 5,000,000,000 dollars,&quot; he added, &quot;will be required to cany out the present programme, and it is estimated that by 1.919 the United States will, be in a position to turu out over 13,1)00,000 tons of shipping in the one year.&quot; In referring to after-the-war plans for the creation of a vast merchant fleet, Mr. Hurley said :-&quot;If the programme is entirely successful, the United States will be in a position by 1920 to establish a weekly passenger service between New York, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, and. Caracas on the East coast, and Columbia, Eucador, Peru, and Valparaiso on the West coast. An adequate passenger and cargo service is likewise being planned with the Central American Republics, while the trade requirements of Russia and China will, probably also be met.&quot;Conscientious Objectors. According to the New York- Times (June 10th), 45 conscientious objectors who refused to wear military uniform were recently sentenced by court-martial to imprisonment for life. General 0&apos;Neill, who reviewed the records of the trial, has now reduced the sentence to 25 years&apos; imprisonment in each case.
ENEMY GROUP.AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.The Austro-German Pact. German Wireless of -June 13th records a visit by Baron. Burian to Berlin. Before his departure, the Baron informed, a representative of the Vossisehe Zeitung that it could be confidently stated, that the thought of deepening the Alliance, which had arisen, through the recent meeting of the two Kaisers, had made appreciable progress in public opinion on both sides. He looked forward, with, great pleasure to the coming visit of Count Hertling to Vienna. (And see Reports Nos. 08--72.)The Subject Nationalities: Criticism ofthe Versailles Declarations. According to a Vienna communication of June,11th to the Dutch Press, the statements issued by the interallied Supreme War Council, (see Report -No. 71) regarding Czech and South-Slav war aims is regarded by the leading Vienna papers as an abandonment of those aims by the Entente, and as evidencing a desire to avoid arousing far-reaching-expectations on the part of the nationalities in question. Lord Reading reports that a similar impression prevails amongst J ugo-Slavs in the United States.A Ministerial Designation. The Vienna Press reports the resignation of Count Toggenburg, Minister of the interior, and his replacement by herr Gayer, an official of the Police.(And sec under &quot; Italy.&quot;)GERMANY.Anniversary of the Kaiser s Accession.- June 15th was the thirtieth anniversary of. the KaiseFs accession to the throne, Congratulatory articles were published by the Berlin newspapers. According to German Wireless of that date, (Jar-mania remarks that &quot; William II. is still the peace Kaiser, as he stands, with his whole people, engaged in a superhuman struggle for honour, existence, and the futur. The Kaiser&apos;s Jove of peace shines in the midst of war brighter than before.&quot; In replying to the Chancellor&apos;s felicitations, the Kaiser describes himself as a Prince of Peace. The Norclcleutsche Allgemeine Ze.(IV).ng contains a tribute from the National Labour Movement Deputy, Wallbaum, to the Kaiser as a social reformer. German Wireless of June 18th reports encomiums exchanged between the Kaiser and General Hindenburg, the former incidentally characterising the -war as a struggle between German justice, freedom, honour, and morals on the one hand, and Anglo-Saxon idolatry of money on. the other.Pan-German Peace Offensive. The views of a prominent German upon the present peace offensive of the Pan-German, party are reported to the Foreign Office as follows : The ultimate object of this offensive is to nail the German Government down to a declaration of annexationist. policy such as would be unacceptable by the Entente ; the war would then go on until, a &quot; German peace &quot; could be made. The immediate object &quot;of the offensive is to put Billow in the place of Hertling. lie personifies the &quot; peace of power&quot; policy. For some time past he has been back (from Switzerland) in Berlin&apos;, and very active ; the chief difficulty in the way of his elevation, the Austrian veto, is now removed, owing to Austria&apos;s complete collapse ; there are rumours that he has come to an arrangement with Ludendorff, and that Erzberger is a party to the intrigue. The Pan-Germans have long thought that llertiing was not auhexationist enough, hence their stories about his feeble health. (And see Reports Nos. G2, 65, and 67.)Prince Lichnoioshy. According to a report received by the Foreign Office it is improbable that Prince Lichnowsky will in fact be prosecuted, one reason being that the German Government would like to keep him to approach England some day. ft is denied that he is at present in Switzerland, though, for some reason unknown, his arrival there was announced, in the German Press.
Prussian Franchise. According to Berlin &quot;messages of -Trine 11th and 12th, the Prussian House of Representatives has for the fourth time rejected the Government-proposal for equal suffrage. By a majority of 255 against 1.51- votes a compromise was accepted, providing for two extra votes, namely, one on the ground of age, and another for officials and persons in independent occupations, and employees and workmen in high positions.   A. fifth reading will now he necessary.Russian Military Deputation to Berlin. The Vossische Zeitung announces the arrival of a military deputation from the Russian Government iit Berlin. This deputation forms part of a Commission which is to deliberate on a series of political,, military and economic questions. . -Russian hah our in Germany. Peports received indicate that Russian prisoners in Germany have in many cases become thoroughly &quot; Germanised.&quot; They work willingly at any employment, have thoroughly assimilated German discipline, and neither require nor are subjected to much supervision. Many of them, fearing unsettled conditions in Russia, have made up their minds to remain in Germany after the war.Germany and the Caucasus. A report received emphasises the value to Germany of the Caucasus as a future source not only of foodstuffs, but of nearly every raw material, she requires. The immediate value of this region is limited almost solely by transport difficulties, but apart from undeveloped possibilities., the Caucasus could, under the domination of the Central Powers, provide immediately after the conclusion of peace an abundant supply of oil and manganese, which are both of vital importance ; while the opening of the Dardanelles and the Mediterranean wordd to a great extent solve the present difficulties of transport. There is also the importance to Germany of obtaining a large volume of exports for exchange with other countries, particularly with Russia and Turkey ; these exports would greatly improve tier balance of trade and assist in restoring her foreign exchanges. More important still, the possession of the, Caucasus would be yet another forward step in the realisation of Germany&apos;s Eastern ambitions: it would take her a stage further to the shores of the Caspian it is on the high road to Turkestan.   (And see Report No. 70.)Post-War Shipping: According to a report received, the German-Australian Steamship Company has hired quay-space in a Hutch East Indian port. A ship-building yard which, the Hamburger Nachricliten says, is likely to become one of the largest of such undertakings in Germany, is to be established at Hamburg by a combination which includes the Hamburg-America Line. The new Company has a provisional capital of Mk. 10,000,000. (See also Reports Nos. 09, 70, and 72, and under &quot; Argentine Republic.&apos;&quot;&apos;)NEUTRAL GROUP.ARCENTLNE REPUBLIC.President Irigoyen. A memorandum (G.T. 4S47 of June 12th) by the Political Intelligence Department, discusses conditions in the Argentine Republic, pointing out their intimate association with the person of President Irigoyen. Upon his election the President found himself in a difficult position, since, according to the Argentine Constitiition, the President and the two Chambers are not elected simultaneously. The Radical Executive is in this case faced by a large opposition majority both in the Chamber of the Dejuities and in the Senate. When, therefore, the Chamber and Senate both passed resolutions. in favour of breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany, the President took no action as he felt that the sanction for these resolutions was based on a register quite different from the one on which his own election was fought and won. He preferred to wait for the result of the elections of the Chamber, which were&apos; clue in the early part of this year. According to results ascertained the present constitution of the Chamber is, roughly, 58 Radicals (IrigoyeAs party), 51 Opposition members, and S Dissentient Radicals. (These latter will almost certainly vote with the Radicals on matters of national importance such us Foreign Relations.)   The Government, is still faced with a heavy majority against
fl 239it in the Senate, but it is unlikely that the Senators will try seriously to obstruct the Government measures. The President has shown many signs of. benevolence towards the Allies, and should occasion arise for breaking Argentine neutrality in favour of the Allies he would probably carry 75 per cent, of the population with him. Reasons -which might tend to prevent such a course include, (I) the desire of Argentines to be considered as completely independent of the influence of the United States, (2) the reported dependence of the Administration upon German financial, interests for funds wherewith to pay Government employees, (3) continuance of railway strikes made possible by political antagonism between the President aud the interests represented by the railway companies.Reported Purchase of German, Ships. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, the Germans have agreed to sell some 1.50,000 tons of Olerman shipping to the Argentine Government with a secret stipulation that all vessels thus sold shall, at the conclusion of hostilities, be immediately freighted to Germany -with foodstuffs.Economic Prospects.-&quot;According to a report received, the economic position in the Argentine is likely to be serious if the war continues much longer, owing to the glut of unexported cereals and wool, and the shortage and high price of imports.crrihE.British Special Mission. A Press telegram of June .18th announces the arrival of the British Special Mission at Bos Andes en route to Santiago.British Offer of Aeroplanes.- His Majesty&apos;s Government recently offered 50 aeroplanes to the Chilian Government in consideration of its acquiescence in the transfer to the British Navy of Chilian warships building in Great Britain. The news of this offer has caused considerable agitation in Peru, where anxiety is expressed regarding the military ambitions of Chile, especially as against Bern and the Argentine Republic. Mr, Rennie has pointed out -to the Peruvian Foreign Minister that Peru would in fact have been in a relatively weaker position .if -Chile had obtained delivery of the warships, lie reports, however, that the Peruvian Govern-merit and people require reassurance, and that they would welcome some general declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government guaranteeing South American States against aggression by their neighbours. Sir A. Peel reports that the Brazilian Government is much concerned at this seemingly preferential treatment of Chile, having regard to its policy during the war.Nitrate of Soda. The Chilian Government is submitting a scheme for sale of nitrate of soda to the Allied and United States Governments.DENMARK.Relations with Iceland. Sir R. Paget reports that the King of Denmark has appointed a Committee to proceed to Iceland in order to negotiate about the connection of the latter with Denmark. The Committee consists of four members, representing the Government and the three parties (other than the Conservatives) who have assented to the proposal. One of these members is Borgbjerg, representing the Social Democratic Party. There is little doubt that Borgbjerg is party to the anti-British propaganda concerted between the Germans and the Danish Socialists in connection with Iceland. (See Reports Nos. 50, 54, 67-71,- and Memorandum G.T. 4828, dated. June 7th, by the Bolitical Intelligence Department.) The Danish and Swedish Press adversely criticise the agreement made between Iceland and &quot;the Allies regarding Iceland wool; they complain that it. involves the expropriation of stocks belonging to Danish and Swedish interests, and that the Allies thus obtain wool at a price much lower than that paid by the original purchasers. It is asserted that the agreement was reached through British pressure.5873-3b      - O &apos; &quot; -
Faroe Islands-Mr.,G,pates reports that on Jane 15th..the Governor of the Farpe Islands prohibited the exportation of imported goods and the supplying of vessels not belonging to the Islands.FINLAND.Conslilvtion, Sir . E. Howard reports the Government Constitutional Bill, handed to the Diet on June 12th, to he as follows : Finland, to he a free indivisible constitutional monarchy with hereditary succession in the male line only; the King cannot be the sovereign, of another .country, and must be a Lutheran. He must promise before accession, to guarantee the Constitution, while his decisions must be countersigned by a Minister of ,State, who will refuse to countersign i f the King&apos;s decision be unconstitutional. The King is to decide questions of foreign relations, but the Diet must approve foreign treaties. The King cannot commence an offensive war without the consent of the Diet. He is General of the land. and. sea forces, and has. the right to grant pardons. The King nominates Ministers, but the Diet assembles annually without his summons. He sanctions Bills passed by the Diet, and if he refuses to sanction a Bill concerning the Constitution or ,nafional defence, such Bill becomes void. If he refuses to sanction an ordinary Bill and such Bill be repassed by a two-thirds majority of the new Diet, the Bill becomes law in spite of his sanction. Should the Royal family die out, the State Council governs till a newly elected Diet selects the new Sovereign. The King becomes adult at IS and cannot leave the country for more than six mouths without the consent of the Diet. Ministers must be Finnish^subjects and responsible to the Diet for their.actions.ddie German Comiuander-in-Chief has declared his intention of withdrawing the German forces.unless the Government passes the Bill promptly.According to the existing Finnish Constitution a two-thirds majority of the full Diet is necessary for any important change, of Government and a five-sixths majority for any urgent resolution. The decision of the old Diet was unanimously in favour of the Finnish Republic and was so proclaimed to the world. ddie question of a monarchy was not raised until the arrival of the Germans. Owing to the exclusion of the Socialists the present Diet numbers 108 only out of 200. Of tins number about 52 per cent, are \n favour of a monarchy. Nevertheless the present Government is endeavouring to force through this vital matter by a bare majority in a non-representative House. According to the Swedish. Press, Prince Oscar of Prussia is being mentioned as.the most probable, choice. It is stated that the Swedish group has declared its willingness to support the Senate&apos;s proposal to introduce a monarchy on condition that the rights of the Swedish element are secured. Senator Erey has, however, resigned his position in the Senate as a protest against the lack of - representation. of the Swedish party and against the appointment of Sario. ddie resignation of Senator Luochivutori is also announced. (And see Reports Nos. 07-69 ancf72.)A run/.   ddie Swedish Press announces that Colonel von Reederu (see Report No. 72) is officiating as Adjutant to Colonel Procope, the Finnish Chief of General Staff.   He has announced that the younger officers of the army will be trained, in Germany.   Sir E.  Howard  reports  that  there   are now   at least 50,000 German troops in Finland, and that the number is steadily increasing.   Further classes will shortly be called  up  lor the Finnish Army (contrary to  German  Wireless of  June   19th),   and  a  Finnish  White   Army   of  50,000   may  be   anticipated. General  Mannerheinds second   in   command   has   resigned, stating   that, having devoted himself to re-establishing order in Finland, he does not wish to remain to-see his work fall to pieces,   ddie British and French Ministers in Stockholm are informing the Finnish Charge d&apos;Affaires that their Governments are opposed to the provision of any food supplies to Finland so long as it remains under German direction.Finland and IheNortli. A Memorandum (96904) hy the Foreign Office sets out the claims, strategical, geographical, ethnographical and economic, asserted by the Finnish Government.to. Karelia and the Kola Peninsula. It is pointed out that so long as the German military authorities dominate Finnish policy, it is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to do otherwise than resist any movement, which, though nominally based on the satisfaction of Finnish claims, tends in. fact to further and. promote
Txermari interests. Sir 1&quot;. Howard is instructed to inform the Finnish Government accordingly. The Foreign Office is informed from a fair source that German troops have been concentrating at Yiborg for a movement northwards by the Ladoga-Onega boat route with, the probable object of an offensive against Murmansk. A reliable -source reports that the Finns.and Germans intend to occupy, by force if necessary, a port in the north. General Mannerheim is reported as stating that both the Finnish Government and the majority of the Finnish people are determined to obtain such a port at the present opportunity &quot;without waiting for any possible adjustment by a Peace congress. Mr. Grove, however, reports that Finnish opposition to the scheme-is now growing, and that the pace is being forced by the Germans, who propose to start operations in the middle of July. Mr. Lockhart has received from the Bolshevist Government a protest, doubtless inspired by tire Germans, against the presence of Allied naval or military forces on the Murman coast.British, Ban!;, Balances. Sir 11 Howard reports a complaint that some difficulty still exists in obtaining payments from Finnish accounts in England apparently on the footing that Finnish bank balances may not be touched so long as German troops are in Finland. In requesting confirmation of this and enquiring whether such conditions, if existing, could be modified, Sir E. Howard emphasises the desirability of first obtaining a written assurance of reciprocity from the Finnish Government. (And see Reports Nos. 68, 70 and 72.)MEXICO.Germany and Mexican, Relations with the  United States.-President  Wilson recently received at the White House a party of Mexican journalists.   He informed them that the attitude of the United States towards Mexico was one of sincere friendship, and that he was not concerned with the internal settlement of Mexican affairs.   He was sorry to learn that influences, which he assumed to be German in origin, -were trying to create a wrong impression in Mexico as to the purpose of the United States.   The President also said that the influence of the United States was at the present time somewhat pervasive in the affairs of the world.   He believed that this was the case because the smaller nations were coming to the belief that it was the sincere desire of the United. States to do disinterested service.   The President, at tin; end of his address, referred to the Monroe doctrine.   One of the difficulties that arose in the relations of the United States with Latin America was that the Monroe doctrine had been adopted Avithout the consent of the Latin American Republics. The United States had said, &quot; We are going to lie your big brother whether you. want us to be oi- not.&quot;   Some time ago he had proposed a sort, of Pan-American agreement, suggesting a common guarantee that all the countries in the American continent would sign a declaration of political independence and territorial integrity.   Such, an agreement meant that, if any one of the North or South American Republics violated the political independence or territorial integrity of any of the others, all would join against the offending country.   That was the kind of agreement that would have to be the foundation of the future life of the nations of the world.   That was the only conceivable basis for the future peace of: the world.   It had been his ambition that the States of the two continents of America should show the way to the rest of the world as to how to make the basis of. peace.   Peace could, come only hy trust.   So long as there was suspicion, there would be misunderstanding and trouble.In reference to this interview German Wireless (Serials 4999 and 5032) quotes 1 &quot;orwarbs and the Norddeutsche Allgcmeine Zeitung, as exposing the selfish aims of the United States. The economic, and therefore the political, independence of San Domingo and certain European neutrals is contrasted with the peaceful development of the Argentine Republic and Paraguay, which, &quot;devote themselves to the works of progress, and no.one thinks of using his,activities to bring about internal unrest or engage in foreign adventures.&quot; Mr. Thurstan reports that, by way of countering President Wilsons friendly speech, the Mexican Government has published the complete text of the American protest against the taxation recently imposed upon exports of petroleum from Mexico (see Report No. 58). An effort is also being made by the Mexican Press to inflame national feeling.Arrival of a, Wheat Cargo.   On June  10th Mr.  Thurstan reported on good -authority that the Acting Minister for Finance had proceeded to Manzauillo to meet
the S.S. Palmira, stated to be due with a cargo of wheat from a South American Port... (? See Reports Nos. 64 and 71.)British Press Telegrams. Mr. Thurstan submits the tin desirability of permitting, the despatch from England of Press telegrams disparaging Allied military&apos;achieve-in &amp;hts as compared with German, and quotes an example reproduced in the German. Legation organ Dcmoerata (and see Report No. 58).NETHERLANDS.Proposed Convoy to Dutch East Indies: Activist Propaganda in. Sweden. Sir AY alter Townley reports that the Netherlands Government lias expressed its readiness to accept in their entirety the conditions prescribed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in -regard to the sailing of the proposed convoy to the Dutch East Indies. (See Reports Nos. 70-72.) The Netherlands Foreign Minister has submitted to Sir AV. Townley papers vouching the passengers and goods on board the steamship Noordam and the military passengers in the auxiliary cruiser Tabanan. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir VV. Townley as to a number of points regarding which His Majesty&apos;s Government must insist upon specific performance by the Netherlands Government of the conditions accepted. For example, dyestuffs, apparently of enemy origin, have been loaded on board the Noordam in breach of such conditions. The-sailing of the convoy, which was to take place on June 19th, has been postponed. Sir E. Howard reports that the Swedish Conservative Press has been taking considerable interest in the proposed convoy, which it describes as directed against the British blockade. The Aflonbladet of J one 12th urges that Sweden should follow Holland&apos;s example, especially if Denmark could be induced to join in the expedition, which would, then be convoyed by both Swedish and Danish warships. The article concludes by saying that &quot;it would be unpardonable folly on the part of the Swedish Government not to send a convoyed expedition to the Argentine. It,would also be feasible to arrange for the convoying home of vessels already lying loaded in foreign ports. A decree regarding convoys was issued in 1915 when convoys were used more than the public knew, and all that is necessary is for shipowners to apply to the Government for this protection for their vessels.&quot; The Foreign Office has authorised Sir E. Howard to intiinate to the Swedish Government that the Dutch convoy has been permitted only in exceptional circumstances and does not constitute a precedent.German Traffic through Holland. The Dutch Press reports that the following optional trains are to be scheduled through Limburg as from June Pith: 24 from Dalheini-Vhadrop to Hudel-iiamont. and 24- vice versa ; 12 trains from Kaldeukirchen-Venlo past (?) Roermond to Hud el-Ham out, and 12 vice versa, thus allowing for the passage of 72 trains per day from Germain&apos; to Belgium and vice versa. The Foreign Office instructs Sir Walter Townley to draw the attention of the Netherlands Govern-nient to this use of-Dutch&apos; territory with Dutch consent for the purpose of transporting supplies which must from the circumstances of the case be presumed to be military unless otherwise demonstrated by the Netherlands Government. Failing immediate-information as to the understanding between the Netherlands and German Govern -ments and the nature of the traffic in question, it may lie necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to regard these railways as German military railways and to reserve its full belligerent rights respecting them. With regard to the report that as from June 3rd, 24 trains, containing sand and gravel, were to travel daily from Germany to Belgium across the Netherlands, Sir W. Townley is instructed to request from the Netherlands Government confirmation of the assumption that the amounts so transported will be included in the yearly quantitv of 1,600,000 tons (see Report No. 67).Potatoes for Germany. According to the Telegraaf (June 13th) Germany is to receive 70,000 hectolitres, or about 60 pier cent, of the Dutch new potato crop.Mines. The Netherlands Ministry for Foreign Affairs published on June 15th an official communique stating that the Netherlands Minister in London had reported that the British Government had recognised that the mine which caused the loss of a. pilot boat on February .15th was laid&apos;three miles outside the minefield notified in
1910 due a mistake in navigation in minelaying ; and that the British Government had expressed sincere regret and readiness to pay compensation.Cargoes of Requisitioned Vessels.   With reference to the enquiry of the United States Government -regarding the policy of His Majesty&quot; s Government as to cargoes ex requisitioned Dutch ships, the Foreign Office instructs Lord Reading to express general assent to the views of the United States Government (see also Reports Nos. 03 and 70) subject to the special policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in. the following-particulars : (1) Requisition, with just compensation, of pyrites and coal, pitch phosphates, owing to military exigencies ; (2) reservation, on political grounds, of cocoa beans, oil cakes, cinchona bark, pepper, vegetable seeds and orange peel.Export of Coins and Postage Values.-Sir W. Townley transmits an enquiry by the Trust as to whether the Associated Governments would grant some general permission for transport to the East and West Indies of Dutch and Colonial coins and Colonial postage values.NORWAY.Lulled Stales and, Nomcegicin Shipping : Herman Propaganda. A. German. Wireless message (June .9th) states: &quot;The Chairman of the Norwegian Shipping Federation writes in. Aftenposten, No. 276 : t-&apos; After the method in which the American authorities have hitherto dealt with our interests, one could not cherish any exaggerated expectations regarding the question of Norwegian shipbuilding. During ineffectual.&apos; negotiations which lasted for ten months, the Washington officials put forward to the Norwegian, negotiators such views as would formerly, have been regarded as impossible from citizens of the United States. The ships of Norwegian Shipping Companies requisitioned by the Shipping Board represent a capital of about Kr. 150,000,000. The Shipping Board has not yet granted a single cent as compensation for the ships requisitioned or for their use. The greater part of the ships have already been sailing for a long time on behalf of America. The Shipping-Board continually refused as unacceptable the Norwegian authorities&apos; conditions for a friendly settlement, though they represented a considerable sacrifice on the Norwegian side.&apos; &quot;Germany and, Norwegian Shipbuilding. A reliable report states that since the Norwegian yards refused to accept the conditions of the German Steel. Bureau, supplies of material from Germany have practically Ceased, and the Norwegian ship-building industry is threatened with a complete stoppage. .

It is provided that (1) the Associated Governments will allow Sweden to import fixed quantities of certain commodities, particularly foodstuffs, ddie Swedish Government undertake to prohibit- the export (direct or indirect) to enemy or occupied territory of all rationed articles as well as their products and similar commodities, which might be released by the arrival of the rationed goods. (2) ddie British Government will grant licences for the export to Sweden of 150,000 tons of coal per month. (3) ddie exports of Swedish iron ore to all destinations are to be restricted as from. 1st duly to 0,000,000 tons per annum, of which not more than 3,500,000. tons per annum are to go either directly or indirectly to enemy countries. The Allied Governments are to purchase 2,000,000 tons (luring the year ending . I uly 1st, 19.19, and shall have-the. option of purchasing a further 500,000 tons per annum of iron ores of any class. (4) ddie Swedish Government undertake to export to the Allied countries and to permit the transit to and from Russia and Finland of all articles not specified in the Swedish Ordinances of January 9th, 1915, and May 25th, .19.17, provided, such articles are not required in Sweden, owing to a shortage resulting from the action of the Allied Governments. (5) 400,000 tons deadweight of Swedish shipping shall be handed over to the Allies, half of which shall be free for service in the war zone, ddie whole is to be delivered within two months. Special provision is made for the Anglo-French-Swedish trade and for the regular Swedish oversea services provided the cargoes carried are approved by the Allied Governments. The vessels ceded to the Allies will not be armed; they will sad under the Swedish flag with Swedish crews. (6) The Swedish Government undertake to provide credits for Allied use in Sweden, ddie Agreement came into force on dime 1st, 1918,. and. is to remain in. force for the duration of the war, subject to the right of determination by special notice.Franchise. Sir E. Howard reports that a Bill for the Reform of the Communal Franchise was passed on June Sth by the Second Chamber of the Riksdag hy. 122 votes to 50 and rejected in the First Chamber Ivy 70 votes to 48 in favour of a motion for enquiry in connection with the position of the First Chamber. Amongst other points Mr. Trygger, Leader of the Conservative Party in the First Chamber, urged that equal communal suffrage would mean that the difference between the First and Second Chambers of the Riksdag would be obliterated to the great detriment of the Constitution. Removal of the graduated franchise would leave the farmers in a minority in the Communes. He suggested that the present system should be modified in connection with fiscal reform. Mr. Ifranting said that abolition of the graduated scale of communal voting could not be deferred, as some Liberals seemed to think, until the reform of the First Chamber could be undertaken. It was essential, that the whole of the Left should unite for immediate action. The Swedish Right was much, more conservative than the German Right, for the German Chancellor admitted thai- equal franchise must be granted after the efforts and sufferings of the masses in this war, whereas Mr. Trygger had said in debate that clay that it was, in all circumstances, an error to compensate the masses for their sufferings by democratization. Against such an attitude any action within the extreme limits of the law was justifiable, and it was essential that the entire Left should bold together in this.in a speech to an audience of 4,000 at Erikoepiug on dune 10th, Mr. Branting declared that one means of breaking down the opposition.of the Right was to use the majority of the Left in common- voting of the two ,Chambers on financial questions, and that if necessary resort must be had to a dissolution.
Scandinavian Transport Workers&apos; Protest against Submarine Warfare.-The Norwegian Dock and Transport Workers&apos; League have long been considering what action can be taken to force the belligerents to treat neutral.seamen in a,humane manner. It was proposed that tlie members of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation should boycott ships sailing under the German flag. Upon the matter being referred to the Scandinavian Committee, the Swedish and Danish members -expressed the fear that such, action would create further difficulties fqr neutral, countries, idle Conference, however, unanimously protested, against the methods employed by the belligerents, more especially by tlie Germans. According to a Press report, Captain Tapper and Mr. Chambers, of the Seamehs Un ion, after a successful Conference in Copenhagen, have been refused permission to confer in Sweden regarding a newly-formed federation which the Swedish SeameiOs Union have joined, With regard to the attitude of Danish seamen see Report No. 62, and for that of the French see under &quot; France.&quot;Shortage of Cargoes at (Jerman Ports.  Aftonblad of June Lt-tli states that Swedish vessels have lately had difficulty in obtaining cargoes at German ports, especially at Lubeek, where general cargoes are usually loaded. One vessel returned empty to Stockholm on June 13th having been unable to obtain cargo at La beck. The paper attributes this partly to general shortage of commodities in Germany and partly to uaprecedentedly low water ill the canal system. -Import of coal and coke to Stockholm from the Baltic and North Sea German ports has been remarkably small. Politiken of Julie 15th states that on June 9th nine large German steamers entered the Channel to Stockholm with so little cargo that a half Or a third of the propeller was in each case out of the water. This paper complains that these ships bring nothing to Sweden and return, heavily loaded.SWITZERLAND.Transport of Foodstuffs. At the request of the Swiss Government the Wheat Executive has authorised the Wheat Export Company to furnish a further 40,000 tons of breadstuffs, as tonnage has not been available to transport supplies from the Argentine. rcSupply of&quot;Milk to. Allies. The Foreign Ollice learns that under the Wood and Agricultural Products Agreement signed at Berne on May 1st, the Allies will secure only 50 per cent, of the Swiss surplus of milk products, and not 60 rjev cent., as was originally arranged. (See Report No. 66.) The Allied percentage will consist wholly of condensed milk, while the German share will consist mostly of cheese. The Swiss milk surplus can hardly&apos; be very considerable during the coming year. The Nestle Company have already been obliged to close two of their factories and to suspend altogether the production of unsweetened condensed, milk, as they have been required to reserve large quantities of fresh milk and butter for the Federal Milk Office.Allied Money.---According to a report received by the Foreign Office, the recent depreciation of British banknotes has been caused by extensive purchases by Swiss banks in London. A. steady fall, in the rate of sterling cheques is reported. The Geneva banks have upwards of 10,000,000 francs at the disposal of the Bulgarian National Bank, and. Bulgarian agents are&apos;expected to return to. Switzerland in the near future (and see. Reports Nos. GO, 02-65, 67, and 70 under &quot;Netherlands,&quot; &quot; Norway &quot; or &quot; Switzerland &quot;).Suspicions Demands for Swiss Banknotes. A report received, indicates that the German and Austrian Governments as well as private persons are accumulating Swiss banknotes. In view of the danger of notes returning for large gold purchases after the war, the Federal Government has prohibited their further exportation.URUGUAY.Uruguay and the United Slates.-The Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is prospective candidate for the Presidency of the Republic, has accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to the United States.   The authorities at Washington
1Ghave put a man-of-war at his disposal for the journey. The matter has given satis-factiou at Montevideo and is thought to imply a step forward in the Pan-American movement. The possibility of a permanent commercial understanding between South. American countries which have broken relations with Germany is discussed.Tiff. YAH AW.Protest by the Pope. The Osservatore Romano (June 12th) publishes an autograph letter from the Pope sent in answer to an address received by the Pontiff from the episcopacy of Lombardy. The Pope complains of the sad period through which the world is passing, and also of the attacks from &quot; enemies of religion against the supreme authority of Jesus Christ entrusted to him whom God created Master and Defender of Justice.&quot; The Pope adds that he is greatly afflicted, not only by &quot; the indescribable horrors of this war, which is without parallel in the history of the world, and which threatens to drag poor Europe to the bottom of an abyss,&quot; but also by the insidious and. skilful campaign of calumnies and hatred which had been directed against the person of the Pontiff and against his work while he could conscientiously address to mankind, bathed in its own blood, the words of the prophet Isaiah: &quot; What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done it? &quot; The Pope recapitulates all lie has done since the beginning of the war, saying that all his efforts to bring-about peace have been misjudged and misinterpreted. Even his silence about this or that crime has been calumniously interpreted, his critics refusing to recognise that in the present uncertainty of things and amidst the blazing of passions it is-impossible to mete out condemnation for each crime while all are included in the condemnation pronounced according to general principles. The Pontiff regrets that the campaign has also been levelled against the Catholic clergy, thus spreading the seeds of discord among various classes. The letter ends by protesting against and denouncing these machinations, not only to the faithful, but to&apos; all honest people wherever they may be found. The Pope reaffirms that it is his duty to defend the sanctity and honour of the Church, which has been entrusted to him by Providence.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. The Germans evidently dominate the Kieff peace negotiations between the Russians and the Ukrainians, and the most interesting point is the hasty con-elusion of aii agreement to exchange prisoners of war, followed immediately by a demand, from Vienna for A ustro-llungarians to be repatriated via the Ukraine. This lends colour to reports that the Germans are now withdrawing troops from the Ukraine for the Western Front, replacing them by Austrians.German determination to secure immediate control of all the Russian black Sea war vessels at Novorossisk is again clearly indicated.Russia. German Wireless of June 12th. announced that the Russian Commission-for conduct of the Germa.no-Russian, supplementary negotiations arrived ill Berlin on June St.li. Mr. Wardrop on June 5th (received 13th) gave an explanation, appearing in the Moscow official journal,, of the Berlin negotiations, which &quot; are of an economic-political character.&quot; The article adds that the Soviet have never concealed their opinion, that the Brest peace is aggressive and. antagonistic to the interests of the popxdar masses of Russia. Additional information is given about the German numerous violations of the Brest Treat)&quot;. (See also under Germany for the brow-beating attitude adopted&apos;towards Russia in these negotiations.)Russian-Wireless of June 1.4th reported a decision come to with the Ukrainians-at Kieff to cease hostilities on both sides of the Don and Voronezh fronts, to establish a line of demarkatiou, and to appoint delegates for this purpose. Delegates from the Black Sea Fleet are also mentioned in the message. German Wireless of June 15th. reported that the &quot;Preliminary&quot; Ukrainian-Russian Treaty was signed on the afternoon of June 13th. Its contents referred to the discontinuance of hostilities, the facilities for military&apos; repatriation, the exchange of prisoners of war, the preparations for an exchange of railway materials, the introduction of facilities for commercial relations, and  the readiness  to   enter  into final, peace  negotiations...
(Mr. Warclrop&apos;s reports of June 1st (received 12th), June 4-th (received loth), and June 5th, and Russian Wireless of June 14th, showed that, under the influence of Marshal Eichhorn, the Ukrainians had made crushing demands for the expansion of the Ukrainian frontiers to include certain specified districts lying within Russian territory, and &quot; exchange of railway materials &quot; seems to imply seizure of Russian rolling stock in German interests. Russian Wireless of June 14th also reported that the Commission for defining the boundary line was composed entirely of military representatives, who arrived quickly at a complete agreement.0 The Ukrainian proposal was rejected, aud the new line is iu accordance with the actual situation at the front.t The Armistice Commission was to sit on dune 12th, and a supplementary Session of the peace delegates would afterwards be convened.) Austrian Wireless of dune 16th published a message from the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Vienna to the Foreign Affairs Commissariat at Moscow, requesting the immediate despatch of Austrian prisoners of war in certain districts of Russia to return to Austria &quot; over the Russian lines to the Ukraine.&quot; (N.B. Other reports have been received to the effect that Austrians are to he employed to relieve German troops withdrawn from the Ukraine for employment on the AYestem front.)Arising out of peace discussions, Russian Wireless on June 13th contains a very important message from M. Trotsky to the Chief Commissary of the Fleet at Novorossisk, about the Black Sea rear vessels. This message contains the following passages :-&quot; The German Government categorically demands the return of all our ships from Novorossisk to Sebastopol.....Germany recognises the right ofproperty of the Russian Republic in these ships, and she declares that after the conclusion of a general peace they will be returned to Russia. In his message of June 6th to Count Mirbach, Baron Kuhlmann delivered an ultimatum to us demanding that our reply shall be at Berlin before June 14-th at 7 p.m. Having regard to the constant difficulties in our communications with Berlin we have given Count Mirbach an early reply. In his message, Baron Kuhlmann agreed to guarantee that, before a general peace is concluded, Germany will not rise these ships which will return -from Novorossisk to Sevastopol. As the return of our ships from Novorossisk to Sebastopol is a fundamental condition of all further agreements between Germany and ourselves, for the cessation of hostile action, and for negotiations, the Peopled Commissary for Foreign Affairs begs (sic) the Supreme Naval Collegium to order our ships at Novorossisk to return to Sebastopol.
