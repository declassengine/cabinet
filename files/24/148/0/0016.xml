SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No.  65.PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.Peace Discussions (page 1.4).Russia. The controversy with the Germans about the Ukraine boundaries is of special interest, especially in so far as it affects the Crimea and. the security of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which, as the Russians have informed the Germans, is at Sebastopol. (The powers of this fleet, if efficiently manned, to affect the war situation are sufficiently obvious. The Russians1 accuse the Germans of blockading it by submarines from the sea and by troops on the land side.)The message from M. Joffe, the new Russian (Bolshevist) Ambassador at Berlin, raising questions about the interpretation of the &quot;peace&quot; treaty, is mysterious.Lithuania and Esthonia. The German policy is clearly to detach these Provinces from Russia, by force if necessary.Germany. Attention is drawn to Sir 1.4. Rumbold&apos;s report, corroborated from other sources, of a new German &quot; peace offensive.&quot; In this connection it may be important to consider the possibility of the acute distress in Belgium being increased and exploited by the Germans in the hope of obtaining concessions elsewhere from their opponents, who are unable, for the time being, to effect a rescue by military force.Rumania. There have been delays in resumption of the peace negotiations. Von Kuhlmann is stated by German Wireless to have been ill. Both he and the new Austro-Hungarian Minister (Baron Burian) are said to be going to Bucharest at the end of the week. Meanwhile the Russians, the Ukraine Rada, and Bulgaria protest about the transfer of. Bessarabia to Rumania.The object of the German insistence on demobilisation of the Rumanian Army as a preliminary to discussion is now fully apparent.Turkey and Bulgaria. The attitude of these countries towards peace discussions is worth watching.Italy (page 5).It is significant that the policy of sending Italian troops to the battle in France has received strong support in the Chamber of Deputies.Germany (page 6).The domination of the military party over policy still continues, but their future seems to hang upon the issue of their great Kaiser-Battle, a title which seems recently to have been quietly dropped.   (The divergence in war-aims between Germany and1 See Russian Wireless of April 24th, received after compilation of this Report.

For greater facility in reference, a slight rearrangement has been made this week of the headings under which the information about different countries is grouped in the report. General notes, affecting several countries, are put first, then countries Aostile to Germany, then. Enemy countries, then Neutrals, and then Peace Discussions.   It is hoped that this arrangement will be found more convenient.

FART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.GENERAL.Allied Labour. Lord Reading reports that the mission of. Mr. Appleton and his colleagues to the United States has been very successful in regard both to the repre-sentatives and the emploj^ers of labour. It assisted considerably towards the solution of labour problems, and was much appreciated hy the United States Government.Far Fast.- The Foreign Office Teams that metals, machinery, railway material, foodstuffs and sanitary goods continue to go forward from Vladivostock to Moscow at the rate of some 10 waggons a day, apparently at the order of Lenin (see Report No. 64). The Japanese Government closely associates the question of disposal of Avar material at Vladivostock with that of intervention, and is therefore inclined to await a decision on the latter point before taking action regarding the former. Mr. Lockhart suggests that the withdrawal of the landing parties would have a reassuring effect upon the Bolshevist attitude towards the Allies. A panic was caused among the local Bolshevists by a rumour that Semenov was advancing on vladivostock-vladivostock via Nikolsk ; about 1,000 sailors and. Red Guards proceeded to Nikolsk, but have since returned. Meanwhile the Soviets appear to be strongly established in Siberia and to be subjecting capitalists to drastic&apos; treatment. Nevertheless local British subjects and Americans deprecate the abandonment of Allied economic interests.Anglo-Turkish Agreement. The Foreign Office learns that the Anglo-Turkish Agreement regarding exchange of prisoners, inspection of camps, &amp;c. (see Reports Nos. 48, 59 and 04) has now been ratified by the Sultan.Poison Gas. With regard to the protest of the Central Committee of the Red Cross against die use of poison gas (see Report No. 55), His Majesty&apos;s Government has given general approval to the terms of a joint Allied reply, and has instructed Sir H. Rumbold to concert with the Allied Ministers in presenting it at Berne.Feeding of British Prisoners of War interned in Holland. Sir W. Townley transmits the views of the Netherlands Foreign Minister regarding the provision of food for British prisoners interned in Holland. The interpretation given by His Majesty&apos;s Government (see Report No. 62) to its obligations under the declaration attached to the Convention of July 2nd is not altogether satisfactory to the Nether-lands Government, which, admitting that payment should not be made twice over for goods consumed, feels nevertheless that His majesty&apos;s Government should provide or assure- the provision of supplies by sale direct to the Netherlands Government, if so desired. In reply to an interpellation on April 16th, in the Second Chamber respecting the feeding of foreigners in. Holland, the Netherlands Prime Minister stated there were at present 100,000 refugees in Holland, of which 14,800 were in camps ; there were 3,835 British prisoners of war, 218 British civilians, 1,607 German prisoners and ],378 German civilians, 679 military fugitives and 1,543 civilians. There were 30,533 Belgian, 1,428 British and 162 German interned. He added that interned persons and prisoners of Avar as well as refugees received the same ration as the Dutch civilian population?Allied Finance and Neutral Purchases. The Foreign Office instructs His - Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in France and the United States to invite the French and United States Governments to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government by discouraging Banks from assisting neutrals in the acquisition, of essential commodities (liable to embargo) whether for immediate shipment or future delivery.
Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total, tonnage of. 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period April 12-lSth, inclusive, was 78,982 tons gross, of which 62,533 were British, as compared with 44,088 tons gross, of which 26,223 were British, reported last week.The Bress of April 25th publishes the following statement issued by! the Admiralty :  &quot;Losses of Merchant Tonnage.The losses of British, Allied, and neutral merchant tonnage due to enemy action and marine risk during the month of March .1918, compared with preceding periods, are set out below : gross tonnage.january february;MarchAprilMayJuneJ ulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberJanuary -FebruaryMarchPeriod.

This statement embraces all United Kingdom seaborne traffic other than coastwise and cross-Channel.ALLIED GROUP.BELGIUM.Food Shortage&apos;in Occupied Districts . The Eoreign Office learns that the food situation in the occupied districts of Belgium is critical. The reserve of bread stuffs will scarcely suffice to maintain the present reduced ration until the end of April; while, if the minimum, ration were kept up, bread supplies from overseas grain, would.
he interrupted for 20 clays. In these circumstances measures are being taken for the immediate diversion to Belgian relief of 10,000 tons of wheat cargoes destined for France and England.BRAZIL.Coal. Sir A. Peel transmits an urgent request by the Brazilian Government for coal, and enquires whether arrangements can be made to supply this from Buenos Ay res, or from British stocks in Brazil.CHINA.Wireless Installations. The Foreign Office, learning that the American Federal Company has applied for a wireless concession in China from a Chinese Wireless Commission, stated to have arrived in San Francisco, instructs Sir J. Jordan to renew his representations to the Chinese Government for the conclusion of an agreement with the Marconi Company for the erection of new stations, as it would now seem that the field is still open and that British interests would not conflict with those of the Japanese concessionnaires (see Reports Eos. 55 and 56).China and Thibet. Sir J. Jordan reports that the position on the Thibetan fronter is unsatisfactory. The Peking Government is preoccupied by the internal situation and by the question of co-operation with Japan regarding the Siberian frontier; consequently the problem of Thibet is left to Szechuen, which has severed relations with Peking and isitself in a very unsettled condition. As the Thibetan question is also of interest to His Majesty&apos;s Government, Sir J. Jordan is prepared to offer friendly and informal intervention.Enemy Aliens. Sir C. Greene reports that there is a probability of tonnage being supplied by the Japanese Government for transport of enemy aliens deported from China (see Report Eo. 64).Trade Maries. -Sir J. Jordan reports proposals put forward by himself for the protection of British interests in regard to trade marks in China.FRANCE.Resignation of Lord Bertie. Lord Bertie has resigned from the British Embassy at Paris, and the War Cabinet has expressed its recognition of his services there during the past 13 years.   He is succeeded by Lord Derby.- Socialist Pa.rtifs Resolution. According to Humanite (April 22nd). the executive committee of the Radical and. Radical-Socialist Republican Party adopted on April 21st the following Order of the Day: &quot;True to its predominating thought of union, the party is deeply moved by the heroism of the soldiers of the Republic and of the soldiers of the Allies. It declares its complete confidence in the victory of Right. It records with satisfaction the results of the Congress of Rome, and heartily shares in. the desire for the liberty and independence of nations oppressed, hy the Central Empires. It stigmatises the criminal attempts made in violation of all international laws, and wishes to see the war conducted by the employment, in ever closer community, of military and economic resources against German militarism and the enemy^s policy of conquest, until the attainment of a just peace, which alone is capable of protecting humanity against the recurrence of such catastrophes.&quot;Commercial Conventions. French newspapers of April 24th report that the French Cabinet decided yesterday to denounce all commercial conventions containing a most-favoured-nation clause or tariff agreements as well as arrangements relating to maritime commerce and any others likely to interfere with the conclusion of any new commercial maritime or customs system.
GUATEMALA.Declaration of War against Germany.  Mr. Young reports that the National Assembly lias voted unanimously a decree declaring that in the present international conflict Guatemala assumes the same belligerent attitude as the United States towards Germany and authorising the executive to take measures accordingly.ITALY.Italy and the Western Front. Italian Wireless of April 19th reports the enthusiastic reception by the Chamber of Deputies of a declaration by sign of Orlando that the Italian Army was the right wing of a united army, and that Italian regiments would shortly participate in the French battle. The Socialist Deputies joined in the premier&apos;s greetings to the French, English and American Armies.Food Supply. Sir P. Rodd reports that the Italian Government is anxious for a special allocation of grain during May and June to ensure the military and civilian requirements of Italy.Shipment of Sicilian Oranges. The Foreign Office learns that the inability of Sicilian orange growers to dispose of large quantities of oranges, owing to difficulties in connection with packing and. shipment, is causing them a certain amount of anxiety. Sir R. Rodd submits the desirability of inviting proposals from the Italian Government, with a view to affording relief.PANAMA.Enemy Aliens. Sir C. Mallet reports that all enemy subjects interned in Taboga Island were removed on Apr&apos;]&apos;]. 17th for internment in the United States.UNITED STATES.Enemy Property. -Lord Reading reports the initiation by the Custodian of Alien Property of a special inquiry, headed hy Mr. J. H. Choate, as to German interests in the principal chemical companies of the United States, with a view to the early and absolute elimination of such interests. His Majesty&apos;s Government is invited to furnish any information available for the purposes of the investigation. (See also Report No. 60.)ENEMY GROUP.AUST 111 A-IIUNG A R V.Internal Conditions. Sir G. Barclay learns on good authority that there is growing dissension between the various nationalities of the Dual Monarchy, particularly between the Austrians and Hungarians. Sir H. Rumbold learns that unless the food situation in -Austria is quickly relieved, there is a probability of considerable trouble at the beginning of May. Should the Germans sustain a set-back in the West, the effect upon Austria might be serious. The Emperor Karl is stated to be very unpopular.Austria and Germany. According to information received by the Foreign Office there is reason to believe that as the result of the disclosures in connection with the Emperor KaiTs letter to Prince Sixte (see Report No. 64) the German Military Authorities are insisting upon the subordination of Austria&apos;s future policy to German requirements, as a condition of the maintenance of existing relations between the Central Powers. The recent visits of Kuhlmann to German Headquarters, and Hohenlohe to Vienna, are believed to have had reference to a compromise, apparently accepted by Austria under the dictation of Tisza.   The resignation of Kuhlmann,
which is regarded as possible (see under &quot; Germany&quot;), would indicate the triumph of the military party and the adoption of an aunexationist policy less deferent to the wishes of Austria,Resignation of Hungarian Ministry. German. Wireless of April 1.8th announces the resignation of the Wekerle Ministry.GERMANY.Predominance of Military Party. It is reported to the Foreign Office that the Military Party is now supreme in Germany, of which Ludendorff has become virtually Dictator. In most classes of the community; from the highest clown, to the Socialists, there is a feeling that Ludendorff concluded peace at Brest-Litovsk when the diplomatists had almost brought about the continuation of the war, which everyone desired to avoid, at all costs. High finance and heavy industry (with which it is intimately connected) both give their support to the Militarists, and the Chancellor and the Civil Government are entirely subordinated to the Great General Staff. As for the Reichstag, the National liberals have already swallowed the complete programme of annexation, and the Centre (with the exception of Erzberger), the Progressives and the Official Socialists are gradually abandoning their inclination towards a conciliatory foreign policy : the Independent Socialists are. numerically weak, and. their leaders are intimidated. A. vast system of terrorism by personal espionage operates to prevent any organised popular jnovement against the Government. Revolution is therefore improbable, and even a failure of the Western offensive would have no decisive effect on the German people except to depress them more. The Government -would find new means to stimulate popular feeling, and with, their . innate patience they would probably believe it. There is a universal conviction that Germany can carry on long enough to wear down her enemies ; and it is considered, by many that the longer the war lasts the better it will end for Germany, because Pacifism and Bolshevism will increase in other countries, while Militarism and discipline will grow in Germany. Germany, they think, will grow more and more warlike, and Germany&apos;s enemies more and more subject to defaitisme. Confidence is felt, even in Government circles, in the submarine warfare ; not as being likely to bring England to her knees by a given date, but as inevitably reducing the Allies (by sinking faster than they can build) to a point where they will be ready to negotiate peace.- Position of the Chancellor. The Foreign Office learns that as the result of serious difficulties with Austria, Count Hertling&apos;s position is becoming very insecure. In the event of his resignation, he may possibly be succeeded either by General von Gallwite (representing Ludendorff and the Military Party), Solf, the Colonial Secretary (fepre-senting financial interests) or -Prince Max of Baden (whose appointment would gratify the Liberals).Offensive against Kuhlmann. The Rheinisehe Weslfalische Zeitung of April 19th (quoted by the Daily Review of April 22nd) publishes a letter from Berlin stating the possibility of Herr von Kiihlmanms retirement is much talked about, even in circles which might be considered as specially well informed. &quot; It is said that he will resign at the latest after the termination, of the Bucarest negotiations. He must first, how-ever, settle in conjunction with Herr Helfferieh current business relative to the Bucarest and Balkan questions.&quot; The letter suggests that Herr von Kuhlmambs optimism regarding the Bucarest negotiations has not been justified. Until a short time ago the official, circles in Berlin entertained the idea that a settlement in the Balkans would speedily and easily he reached, This, however, has not been the case. There is still so much to be settled regarding the differences between Bulgaria and Turkey, between Bulgaria and Rumania, between Rumania and the Ukraine, and finally with reference to the German demands in the Constanza question, that things must be done all over again in Bucarest.- It may, moreover, be stated &quot; that Herr von Kuhlmann feels he is no longer the right man for directing the settlement of the Western questions.&quot;Air Raids. The German Press of April 17th tentatively suggests the mutual abandonment by the belligerents of air attacks behind the respective fronts.   The
Foreign Office.is informed that the Allied air raids into Germany are causing increasing dread among the population, which is correspondingly furious with the German authorities.Employment of Prisoners of War. German Wireless reports : &quot; Up to March 1st, 19.1.8, the Central Powers have captured 3,450,000 prisoners. This figure exceeds the total number of the male industrial forces of Sweden, Norway and Denmark by more than half-a-million. It exceeds by one-fifth Germ any&apos;s male industrial forces in peace times. The Central Powers have already gained by these prisoners an army of workers which is able to render valuable services to industrial organisation, and to replace the greater number of their industrial forces which have been called up for war service. With the continuation of the war this army of workers is increasing, and is being adapted for the economic and technical needs of the Central Powers. The victorious battle in the West has yielded Germany in one month an in crease in prisoners of about 125,000 men.&quot;Russian Ambassador. -German AVireless of April 22nd reports the presentation by M. Joffe of his credentials as the representative of Russia at Berlin. (And. sec Reports Nos. 03 and 64.)Germany and, Russian Industries. The Foreign Office learns that the opinion has been expressed in leading Bolshevist circles that Russian industry will be regenerated by Germans and Scandinavians,- and that Germany already controls, or soon will control, all the producing areas in European Russia. By Wireless of April 24th the German High Command in the East offers flax seed from Pskov to the Russian Central Society for the Cultivation of Flax, in exchange for double the quantity of oilseed from Moscow.German and Austrian Prisoners in Russia. -ME Lockhart learns that the German Government has protested to the Bolshevist Government against the anti-German activities of Austrian prisoners of war in Russia (and see Reports Nos. 62 and 64).The Llchnoiosky Memorandum. -A Report (G.T. 4317) of April 18th by the Political Intelligence Department gives an account of the Lichnowsky Memorandum and its effect in Germany.German Propaganda. Sir II. Rumbold reports that German propaganda is at present busily spreading rumours to the effect:: (1) That the United States Govern-ment is anxious that United States citizens should not remain in Switzerland ; (2) that British Commanders on the Western Front dispute the authority of General Foch ; and (3) that American troops are wanting in tenacity.Eighth German War Loan. -German AVireless of April 2.1st reports the eighth German war loan as amounting to over .144- milliards of marks, and extols this as a magnificient economic war victory over tire Entente; and a testimony of the unshake-able resolve of the German people to hold out as long as necessary, and of the rocklike confidence iu full and final victory. The Vosslsche Zeitung points out that Germany has raised 70 per cent, of her whole war credits of 124 milliards by permanent loans, and contrasts this proportion with those of the various Allied loans ; it also lays stress on the indebtedness of the Allies to foreign States, while German successes have been achieved as the result of her own strength.New Taxation. German Wireless of April 19th outlines as follows the scheme of taxation proposed for the current year : &quot;The great success of her War Loans has removed from Germany the necessity of covering a portion of her war costs by war taxation as England is doing. Since the beginning of the war the method on which the Imperial financial policy has proceeded has been not to attempt to pay back principal, but only to cover the interest on the war loans out of receipts from war taxation. Iu the current financial year to meet this interest liability there are required 2,875 million marks of new taxation as against 1,250 million marks in the preceding year. The Imperial Treasury has resolved upon tapping quite a new source in the Budget which has just been sent to the Reichstag. There are five drafts of bills providing for additions to taxations. The duty ou spirits should bring in 643 million marks. The new beer tax should bring in 393 million marks, and the increase on sparkling wines and non-alcoholic drinks .174 million. New taxation ou Stock Exchange transactions under wdiich there will be an increase m respect to &quot;closing document&quot; stamps and on the opening of bankers&apos; current.
accounts and on the Imperial stamp required on the formation of companies is expected to bring in 214 millions. A bill has been drafted for increasing war taxations on companies, and this is calculated to bring in GOO million marks. Through the raising of the tax on the exchange of goods and the introduction of the tax on luxuries, it is contemplated that 20 per cent, of the value should be obtained. It is anticipated to obtain from diigher postage, telegraph and telephone charges an increase of 125 million marks. The new taxation proposals are meeting with general, approval of the Press of all parties, and even the Socialist Vonodrts admits that the new taxation placed before the Reichstag will bring in a total of 3,170 million marks.&quot;(And see under &quot;Peace Discussions.&quot;) .NEUTRAL GROUP.ARGENTINA.Railway Strikes. The Foreign Office learns that strikes have again broken out on the Argentine railways (and see Reports,Nos. 55 and 56). Sir R, Tower is instructed to impress upon the Argentine Government the necessity of supporting the companies.-&apos;    - DENMARK.^Danish-American Negotiations. Lord Reading reports that the Danish Govern-ment desires to continue negotiations with the United States War Trade Board for a general agreement.. The Foreign Office has expressed its approval. (And see Reports bios. 57-59.)German Prohibition of Danish Exports to United States. Air. Gurney learns that the Germans are refusing to allow Danish ships to carry to the United States a variety of commodities, including cheese and rennet. It is reported that such goods are also being refused by certain Norwegian shipping companies.Danish Elections. In a Memorandum (G.T. 4297) dated April .1.9th, the Political Intelligence Department outlines the development and present position of parties in Denmark. The present. Radical Administration under AI. Zahle has been in office since 191.8. It is greatly dependent upon Socialist support (sec Report No. 56), and is relying upon it in the elections, which are taking place on April 22n.d for the Folketing (Lower House) and May 10th for the Bandsting (Upper House) respectively. A Press telegram announces the return to the Folketing of 45 Liberals, 39 Social Democrats, 32 Radicals, and 23 Conservatives. This reduces the majority of the present Government to 3. Sir R. Paget learns that it is not proposed to forma coalition, but that a method of co-operation is likely to be arranged.Butter. Sir R. Paget reports that the present output of Danish butter is about 20,000 casks per week, which may possibly increase to 25,000 during June and July. The Danish home consumption is 18,000 casks ; of the remainder, Norway and Sweden take 30 per cent., and the United Kingdom and Germany 35 per cent. each. Should the British Government decline its share, the Germans would insist on receiving a large proportion of it. Sir R. Paget therefore recommends its continued acceptance on political grounds, unless this is thought undesirable on account of high prices, sufficiency of home supplies, or other cogent reasons. The Danish Government represents that the price would be more than covered by the new additional charges on British coal.   (And see Report No. 61.)FINLAND.Finnish, Bolshevism and Germany. Mr. Lockhart learns that the White troops have been inflicting drastic punishment on captured revolutionaries, whether military or civilian. The Finnish. Red Guards, finding it difficult to hold their own in Finland, are likely to go north into the Murman district. German Wireless of April 21 st declares to the Bolshevist Government that no regular troops of the Alannerheim Army have taken part in the. alleged advance on Kent. &quot;In any case, the Imperial Government must express its surprise that the Soviet Government should complain of the transference of Finnish battles to Russian territory, seeing&apos; that the principle of
/ : ,       rfff      0 - ,.   p. &apos; ; ijnoninterference in Finnish affairs is apparently not being observed by the Russian Government.&quot; Various concentrations of Russian troops near Finnish territory are then alleged, and reference is made to a report that 250 Russian sailors have arrived at Helsingfors to assist the Red Guards. &quot; So soon as these acts of interference cease and the Russian Government decides to enter into normal relations with the Government of M. Swinhufvud. the German Government will be ready to offer its services as an intermediary for the conclusion of such relations, and for the settlement of any liusso-Finnish disputes that may arise.&quot; These allegations are denied by Russian Wireless of April 23rd, which repeats that Mannerheinds troops have advanced against Kem. A delegation of the Finnish Socialist&apos; Republic has protested to the Allied Representatives in Russia -against the sale of Finland to Germany by the White Guard. &quot; Germany and the Finnish White Guards&apos; policy of violence purposes the destruction of the whole labour movement .... Before all civilisation and in the name of Finnish workers and their Government, we express a most emphatic protest against German oppression in Finland. Finnish labourers are prepared to continue the noble work begun with their blood, never, however, forgetting their hatred and contempt for the arch enemies of democracy and labour.&quot;Protection of Russian Fortresses and Stores at Helsingfors. Russian Wireless of April 18th protests (under Clause 0 of the Peace Treaty) against a claim by the German Military Command at Helsingfors that the defence of fortresses and the guarding of property in the stores of the Russian Republic there shall be given over to German troops.Allied Subjects in Finland. On April 17th His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Abo informed Sir E. Howard by telegram that the Finnish-Government was unable to guarantee the immunity of himself or other British subjects from arrest by the Germans on their arrival. Sir E. Howard thereupon instructed him to proceed, with other British subjects to the nearest point in sole occupation of the White Government and there claim, protection. Meanwhile the Finnish Representative in Stockholm was requested to bring the Consid&apos;s telegram to the notice pf his Government. Mr. Grove reports (April 23rd) that all British subjects in Helsingfors are safe and well.Recognition. Sir E. Howard has communicated to the Finnish Representative in Stockholm the conditional offer of Recognition mentioned in Report No. (54. Particular request was made for free passage of British subjects and goods through Finland to Russia, and for the security of Allied ships and the use by them of Finnish territorial waters. Sir E. Howard has been instructed that Finnish guarantees of neutrality should include a satisfactory reply to the Allied warning regarding aggression against the Murman Railway.Food Supply. The Foreign Office has approved, the terms of a Note proposed to be presented by the Allied Ministers in Stockholm regarding the conditional, supply of foodstuffs to Finland (and see Report No. 63).German Economic Penetration of Finland. According to a report received by the Foreign Office, the Germans are attempting to obtain a dominating interest in several Finnish and Swedish Banks.Finnish. Shipping in Danish Ports. Sir R. Paget learns that the Finnish Govern-ment is taking steps to obtain the use of some 5,000 tons of Finnish tonnage (mostly sailing vessels) now lying in Danish ports.MEXICO.Oilfields. Mr. Cummins reports that owing to the increase of brigandage and the ill-treatment of foreigners in the lower oilfields, mainly attributable to undisciplined Government troops, the employees of five companies have abandoned work and returned to Tampico. The three principal companies, under promise of protection by the Military Authorities, have induced their men to continue operations.British. Subject kidnapped. Lord Reading learns from Mazatlan that a British subject has recently been kidnapped by bandits.5iSl-4b c
soInsurrections. Mr. Cummins reports that Caballero has risen against the Government. Revolutionary preparations are also being made in the Laredo district by Generals Robles and Guellar.N ETHERLANDS.The Allied Offer of Food Supplies : probable resumption of Negotiations.-i!h.&amp; Netherlands Foreign Minister has informed the States General of tlie Allies&apos; offer to supply Holland with cereals and of their guarantees that no Dutch ship sent to fetch them will be requisitioned, and has declared that in his opinion the Allied guarantee is sufficient. In the debate which followed the Dutch Government was criticised for not making this statement before and for not closing with the Allied offer. It was pointed out that Germany could not reasonably, object to Dutch ships leaving Holland under a guarantee that they would be free to return. If these ships were molested by the Germans, Germany would, be clearly responsible for the privations suffered by the Dutch people. [Note. Report No. 64 at page 11, first paragraph, incorrectly reports a statement by the Netherlands Foreign Minister. The Minister in fact said that he had received a communication from&apos; the United States that vessels despatched after March. 20f/i would not be seized.] The Foreign Office learns that the Netherlands Government is now prepared -,to re-open negotiations for a general agreement. Sir W. Townley has pointed out to the Netherlands Foreign Minister that an arrangement for credits must form an integral part of any such agreement. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has instructed Lord Reading to impress upon the War Trade Board the inadvisability of any unconditional offer of supplies. With regard to Dutch A^essels now in neutral ports or at sea, His Majesty&apos;s Government has made an offer to the Netherlands Government guaranteeing that, with the exception of two Dutch vessels (one in, and the other en route to, an Allied port), it will requisition no more Dutch shipping, if tlie Netherlands Government will undertake that Dutch ships in the East Indies will continue to trade as hitherto. A. further, assurance has been given that if the Allied requisition results in a reduction of the amount left to Holland to a point below the the amount apportioned to her under the ration agreement, the deficiency will be made good.German]! and Holland. Sir W. Townley learns that the German Government has made   peremptory demands to the Netherlands Government for (I) relaxation of Customs restrictions regarding new clothes and boots ; (2) free transit of civilian goods by the Limburg railway to Belgium ; (3) acknowledgment of Germany&apos;s right under the-Rhine Convention to the transport of goods of all classes ; and (4) transit (without restriction or control) of sand and gravel, up to 200,000 tons per month, from Germany via Lobith to Belgium ; and export of 250,000 tons per month from Holland to Belgium.   It is stated that the German Minister has instructions to make a fifth, demand, which he has not ventured to communicate officially, for the passage of troops and ammunition over the Limbing railway.   The Austrian Minister has been instructed to support the four demands put forward, and has knowledge of the fifth. Sir W. Townley is informed that the first two conditions have been accepted, and it is reported that further concessions are being made.    The German Government appears to be insistent, and intimates its intention to force the question of sand and gravel.   The Netherlands GoA^ernment regards the situation as serious, but hopes for a satisfactory solution.   Sir W. Townley considers it possible that the existence of the fifth demand has been purposely made knoAvn in order to intimidate the Netherlands Government into acceptance of those officially communicated.   Recent articles in the German Press, discussing Dutch neutrality as affecting German interests, have been sharply criticised hy Vaderland and the Nieuioe Rotterdam sche Courant.Dutch-German Negotiations. Sir W. Townley learns that the negotiations betAveen Holland and Germany (see Report No. 63) are being continued on the following basis : (1) The price of coal supplied by Germany to Holland not to be less than 90 to 100 florins per ton ; (2) seiwices of Dutch ships to be at the disposal of Germamy as soon as the Avar is over ; (3) Germany to have a prior claim to raw materials in Dutch industries at cessation of Avar ; (4) Germany to be given facilities for shipbuilding in Holland; (5) a German N.O.T. to be instituted for identification of material for
shipbuilding aud chartering of tonnage ; (0) fresh regulations to be made in regard to Rhine shipping both during and after the war ; and (7) arrangements to be concluded for credits and the exportation of certain foodstuffs.Purchases of British Notes. With regard to the extensive purchases of British banknotes mentioned in Report No. 64, Sir W. Townley, while repeating that these are in considerable demand in Eastern Europe, suggests that they are also possibly being bought on speculation in Holland. It would appear that a certain quantity are being sold on German account, and it is therefore doubtful whether there is any organised purchase by Germany.   (And see under &quot;Norway.&quot;)Food Supply. Sir W. Townley reports that the Netherlands Government has withdrawn all licencesSgranted for export of foodstuffs and cancelled those outstanding. Instructions have even been given to refuse clearance to steamers already loaded with foodstuffs under licence, unless equivalent imports have arrived ; this measure is, however, still subject to reconsideration. (See also Reports Nos. Go and 64, and under &quot; General.&quot;)Margarine. The War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports: &quot; Eor the present no further supplies of raw materials for margarine will be sent to Holland from the United Kingdom, since the Dutch have begun to retain a percentage of these materials for their own. use. We have always disputed this claim; and we shall require the Dutch to make up the deficiency in their deliveries of margarine to the United Kingdom arising out of their retention of these supplies before we allow any further raw materials to go forward. We are now virtually independent of the Dutch margarine manufacturers. No intimation will bemade to the N.O.T. until they ask us to explain our action.&quot;NORWAY.Norwegian-American Negotiations.- Sir M. Findlay reports that the stock of grain and flour (suitable for human consumption and fodder) existing in Norway on January 1st amounted to 359,850 tons. It is improbable, however, that this total will be available for distribution, as more than half is in the hands of the farmers. The stock of potatoes was 385,818 tons ; upwards of 200,000 tons have to be reserved for seed. There will thus probably be a restriction on the consumption of potatoes till August, aud thereafter a reduction of the already low flour ration. In these circumstances there is a likelihood of serious disturbances in the. near future, unless an agreement, ensuring supplies, can be reached with the United States. In spite of a strong movement in Norway in favour of a cargo-for-cargo policy, the  Norwegian Government is still anxious to conclude a regular agreement. Sir M. Findlay has pointed out to the Norwegian Foreign Minister the necessity for guarantees respecting exports to neutrals and maintenance of exports to the Allies and of supplies to Norwegian factories engaged upon their orders (and sec; Reports Nos. 59 and 60). Meanwhile it is reported that two Norwegian vessels are held up in Dutch ports as a result of German representations, and a third is unable to leave Delfzyl owing to German threats of capture.Bolshevism. In a memorandum (G.T. 4316), dated April .18th, the Political Intelligence Department traces the progress of Bolshevism in Norway (see also Reports Nos. 57, 60, 62, and 63), and sets out the programme of the Workmen&apos;s Councils. Though the situation is serious, there is no reason to anticipate that Norway is on. the brink of revolution. The Moderates still remain leaders of the Trades Unions, and consequently retain considerable influence in the country. No party split has actually taken place. Most of the new men belong to the intellectual school of Syndicalism and are neither uneducated visionaries nor wild anarchists. The Government seems to be alive to the danger of possible disturbance. On the one hand, rations for the workmen have been increased, and large sums voted for relief of the necessitous. On the other, a new law has been drafted, permitting military intervention in the case of strikes, and to prevent rioting, and the general in command has forbidden conscripts or soldiers in uniform to attend meetings of associations with objects inimical to the defence of the country. Whereas hitherto the Norwegian Socialist Executive has stood for disarmament and peace at any price, it is possible that the Syndicalists may
see reason to encourage schemes of defence against the immediate German danger which, through Finland, threatens the Norwegian frontier.Reported destruction of German Petroleum. According to.a report from Tronvsoe, a lighter containing 2,500 barrels of German petroleum intended for sealing has recently been destroyed by fire. His Majesty&apos;s Consul points out that, if this is true,, sealing for German account will be rendered impossible for this season.Norwegian Fish. The Foreign Office learns that though the Norwegian Govern-ment has not denounced the Fish Agreement, it has been regarded by the Norwegian Delegate at Washington as having lapsed. Sir M. Findlay reports that the assent of His Majesty&apos;s Government is being ashed to the export of fish and salt from the north of Norway to Russia during the period June 15th to September 30th. The Russians, who are prepared to purchase from approved, firms, state that, they are receiving offers of salt and fish from German agents.Purchases of British, and American Notes. Sir M. Findlay suggests the desirability of arrangements permitting of the identification of Allied Bank Notes imported into, or sold in, Norway.   (See Report No. 61, and under &quot;Netherlands.&quot;)SPAIN.Spanish Agreements with United States and France. The War Trade Intolli-gence Bureau reports :-^-&quot; Under the Spanish-American Commercial Agreement, concluded on March 7th, the Spanish Government agree to supply the Allies with unlimited quantities of pyrites, minerals and manufactured wool. They also agree to supply the Allies with rice, raisins, onions, olive oil, cotton, hemp and jutes &apos; manufactures, raw manufactured leather and hides, rolling stock and conveyances for transport, subject to the home requirements of Spain and the general obligations of her foreign trade. The United States undertake, to supply Spain, with specific quantities of cotton, petroleum, locomotives and railway materials, metal manufactures, chemicals, machinery, electrical material, aluminium, tobacco, and sulphate of ammonia. A number of contracts for special supplies urgently required by the contracting parties will, be immediately carried out. Each of the contracting parties will find the tonnage necessary for transporting the supplies which it purchases. Goods obtained under the Agreement will, not be re-exported from the importing country without the sanction of the Government of the exporting country.The Franco-Spanish Commercial Agreement provides for an interchange of commodities-commodities between France and Spain roughly on the lines laid down in the Spanish-American Agreement. The French Government undertake to supply Spain, with, unlimited quantities of copra from Madagascar, with specified quantities of phosphate of lime from North Africa, and of tar, pitch and woollen rags. They also agree to admit into. France limited quantities of Spanish wine and fruits, corkwood and vegetable. The French Government undertake to facilitate the Spanish transit trade with Switzer-land through France, and the Spanish Government undertake to facilitate the transit of supplies passing through Spain to or from France and the French Colonies. The fulfilment both of this Agreement and of the Spanish-American Agreement is dependent on the Spanish Government carrying out; an agreed arrangement for financing FrencApurchases in Spain. A. group of Spanish bankers will be authorised to open credits in favour of a French group up to 35,000,000 pesetes a month for 10 months. The advances will be guaranteed by a deposit in Spain of French Treasury bonds or of Spanish securities, representing at least 40 per cent, of the value of the current drafts. The advances may be renewed until Afarch 20th, 1920, when the first reimbursements will be made. Interest will be paid at a rate not exceeding 74; per cent., including brokerage and commission. The Spanish Government will, if necessary, take steps to compel Spanish firms interested in the export trade with France to assist in creating these credits. The credits will be used exclusively to finance the French purchases in. Spain which are covered by the Franco-Spanish Agreement.&quot;German Submarine and other Abuses. The Admiralty reports : &quot; It is satisfactory to note that the crew of the submarine which last month put into Ferrof (see Report No. 61) have been interned in the interior of Spain. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Vigo states that a German submarine is reported to have surreptitiously entered that port on the
night of April 8th and communicated with the German S.S. Neidenfels. An enemy-submarine is also known to have landed a German subject in the vicinity of Alicante about the same date, who, however, was promptly arrested hy the Spanish authorities.&quot; Madrid papers of April 17th (quoted by the Daily Review) state : &quot; The Government has received a message from the owners of the Spanish vessel Louisa, stating that the ship has been torpedoed, and sunk, protesting against this fresh outrage, and expressing their confidence that the Cabinet will take such measures as they deem necessary to safeguard their dignity. The vessel carried a cargo of Spanish fruits, was to have returned to Spain with a cargo of coal, and. then was due to sail again for the United States with a cargo of Spanish produce. Three of the crew went down with the ship.&quot; The Publicidad of April 9th. (quoted by tire Daily Review, Neutral Press Supplement, of April. 19th), referring to the abuse of Spanish shores by German submarines, adverts to the general, attitude of Germany towards Spain as follows : &quot; Spain, is the country which suffers most from German interference. YYe have but to recall the connection between certain events which brought about a Ministerial crisis and certain demonstrations, which during several days affected public affairs, and the negotiations for and approval of the Conventions with France and the United States. In such cases a &apos; mot chord re &apos; is issued by the German Press, and passed on by the pro-Germans.^ This &apos; mot cPordre &apos; is always calculated to attract popular sympathy. In the case of the Conventions it referred to the clearness of food, in the case of sympathy with France, to the danger to neutrality, on the sinking of a Spanish ship the greed of the shipoAvuers became the cry. The workman, dissatisfied with his pay, the mother with a soldier son, the housewife who has to pay a high price for potatoes, a simple folk, not given to thinking, believing that potatoes are dear because France takes them all, or that England is seeking to drag us into war, unconsciously become German agents and seiwe German ends. And meanwhile Germany, Avhile destroying our merchant fleet, is acquiring in the interior positions from Avhich it will be difficult to dislodge her. And all this time Ave are keeping carefully in our ports the 70 ships which, after the war, will perhaps be used to compete with our trade.&quot;SWEDEN.Swedish Negotiations with the Allies and Germany. Sir E. Howard reports that the German Government has accepted the reduction of Swedish iron ore exports to 3,500,000 tons per annum, 750,000 tons of which is to be low grade phosphorus ore. It has also agreed to the chartering of -100,000 tons of Swedish shipping to the Associated Governments. The Swedish Foreign Minister declares his inability to limit the export of cellulose or spinning paper to Germany, but believes it will not exceed the figures mentioned, in the draft agreement; an undertaking can probably be given against the exportation of carbide, hut not against that of pyrites, molybdenum or ferro-silicon. Sir R. Paget reports a statement that the Germans have stopped in the Baltic and directed to German ports about 120 Swedish sailing ships and small steamers, and that they presumably intend to hold up Swedish Baltic shipping as hostages pending the conclusion of Swedish negotiations with the Allies. With regard to Swedish-Dutch trade, Sir E. Howard learns that the Germans have made it a condition for permitting vessels to leave Holland for Sweden that should they subsequently proceed to Entente ports the Swedish Government must obtain a guarantee from the Allies that they shall be free to return. Sir E. Howard &quot;reports the opinion of the Allied Ministers at Stockholm that should it be found impossible to reach a general agreement, it would be highly desirable on political grounds to make another modus vivendi securing tonnage to the Allies and. cereals or other necessaries to the SAvedes.Swedish-German Coed Agreement. The Swedish Press announces the conclusion of an agreement under Avhich Germany will supply coal, up to 150,000 tons per month, to Sweden from May to July inclusive. Sir E. Howard has been unable to obtain official information regarding this agreement.Bolshevism. Sir E. HoAvard reports that the possibility of Bolshevist disturbances in Sweden is seriously regarded by Swedish Conservatives and officers. It is stated, that an active propaganda is being carried on amongst Avorkmen and soldiers and that important regiments are largely affected. On the other hand, the defeat of the Red. Guard in Finland has perhaps relieved apprehensions in this regard, and extreme5481-4,1) D
Socialists themselves have been beard to declare that the time has not yet arrived for drastic action.Export Prohibitions.  Sir E. Howard reports the prohibition of a variety of goods for exportation as from April 19th. These inclu.de certain agricultural implements, combustion and explosion motors and machines for working metal and wood.Indian Nationalist Propaganda.   ddie Swedish Press of April 22nd. publishes a communication from the Indian National Committee in Stockholm detailing the story of Mahendra Pratap&apos;s Mission to Afghanistan (see Report No. (32).SWITZERLAND.Dutch Shipping. Sir Id. Rumbold reports that the Netherlands Legation has recently issued to the Swiss Press a reasoned protest (dated March 30th, and signed by the President of the Council and Foreign Minister), against the Allied requisition of Dutch shipping, ddie Foreign Office has acquainted Sir lb Rumbold with the Allied, case, for the purpose of a reply if thought necessary.Swiss Exports of Embroideries to Central Empires. Sir H. Rumbold reports that the exports of embroideries to the Central Empires during February and March last amounted, to 670 tons over the normal exports for the corresponding months of 1917. ddie Allied Delegates have therefore proposed to stipulate for a reduction of the export ration for the remaining nine mouths of the current year from 750 to 400 tons, ddie Foreign. Office points out, however, that in the circumstances it will be impossible to proceed in the matter until the total amounts of the actual exports for February and March are known.URUGUAY.Uruguay and Germany. Mr. Mitchell limes reports that in reply to the note of the Uruguayan Government regarding the detention of an Uruguayan Mission by a German submarine (see Report No. 63) the German Government now states that the Mission may proceed : the Urugua37an Minister has insisted on a definite answer as to whether the German Government regards Uruguay as being in a state of war with Germany.Entente obligation with Uruguay. Monte Video papers (April 18th) state that treaties making it absolutely obligatory to submit all disputes to arbitration have been signed by Uruguay, France, and Great Britain.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.General. Peace discussions are still in abeyance, and dependent upon the issue of the great, battle on. the Western Front, ddie tone of such discussions as have taken place has been influenced constantly by the fluctuations in the struggle. Sir H. Rumbokbs report of the new German &quot; peace offensive &quot; deserves special attention. Ominous reports: (Lord Bertie, April 23rd) are current of acute distress in Belgium, and there is a possibility that Germany may use the pitiful condition of her victim as a lever to extort concessions for the delivery of Belgium from her dominance.Russia. -Russian Wireless on April 18th stated, in reply to Berlin enquiries, that &quot; the ships of the Black Sea Navy are nearly all at Sebastopol, but Caucasian counter-revolutionaries have seized at Batum a few small ships, ddie Russian Government considers that, in accordance with Clause 5 of the Peace Treaty, Russian warships have the right not Only to stay in their own harbours, but also to go from oue Russian harbour to another, and to navigate near their own coast. A protest is made against the hostile acts committed by the warships of the Quadruple Alliance against the Russian transport ships at sea near the Russian coast, ddie Russian Government, on their own part, intends to take all measures in their power to carry out Clause 5 of the Peace Treaty as affecting the Black Sea Navy.Mr. Wardrop on April 20th reported&apos;that, in reply to Berlin Wireless of April 14th, M. Chicherin expresses surprise that the Germans addressed to Moscow; and not to Kieff a reminder about the non-conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Russia and the Ukraine, Russia not being responsible, for the delay.   M. Chicherin adds a protest.
again against the occupation by Germany of territory beyond the boundaries claimed by the Ukraine Rada. On the same date, M. Chicherin forwarded by wireless to the Russian representative at Berlin the decision come to by the Council of the People&apos;s Commissaries on April 17th about Ukraine boundaries. This decision was that the hostile activities which are taking place in the Ukraine must not be extended into the following territories :-&quot; The Provinces of Kursk, Oral; Tula, Voronezh, the region of the Don Cossacks, and the Crimea, which were considered parts of the Russian Federal Republic even in the one-sided declaration of the Kieff Rada,&quot; referred to in the German Wireless message of March 29th.On April 21st M. chicherin informed the German Foreign Minister in Berlin by wireless that the Russian Government is aware of the fact that the German Minister of Foreign Affairs has enquired of the local authorities of the Crimea about the nationalisation of the flag. M. Chicherin. draws attention to the fact that the &quot; Tauric Republic forms part of the Russian Federal Soviet Republic,&apos;&apos; and trusts that the German Government will not violate the Brest Treaty by putting pressure upon a part of the Soviet Rexmblic &quot;with the object of separating the same from Russia.&quot;Russian Wireless of April 22nd published a protest by M. Chicherin addressed to the German Minister for Foreign Affairs in Berlin against the passage by German or Ukrainian troops through Perskop in the direction of Simferopol.1 The protest con-clud.es with the following words: &quot;According to your communication, even the one-sided declaration of the Ukrainian Government does not include the Crimea within the frontiers of the Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic. This advance into&apos; the Crimea is essentially a violation of the Brest-Litovsk Beace Treaty, inasmuch as it is an invasion of a possession of the Councils Republic. This invasion is threatening our Black Sea Fleet, and may lead to armed encounters dictated in the interests of self-preservation of our Fleet. The Beople&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs hopes that any further advance into the Crimea will be stopped, and it begs the German Government to inform us of its attitude without delay.&quot;Russian Wireless of April 23rd publishes further strong protests at receiving no reply from the Ukraine Rada about opening peace negotiations at Smolensk. (There is interesting matter in the Wireless of the same day- affecting the Fleet.)[For further reports on the controversy about the boundaries of the Ukraine, see under Ukraine.   For Russian protest about Bessarabia, see under Rumania^]Russian Wireless of April 2l.st-22ud reported instructions by MM. Trotsky and Chicherin to the Soviets and all &quot;Government authorities to comply with the Brest Peace Treaty as affecting agitation and propaganda directed against Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey.On April 23rd M. Joffe, Russian (Bolshevist) Ambassador in Berlin, seat a message by wireless to M. Chicherin at Moscow requesting postponement of the publication of the Beace Treaty, on the plea that the Russian translation is considered incorrect, and &quot; nothing is known here of the final draft which is said to have been accexited by Germany.&quot;On the same date Russian Wireless published a very strong protest to the German Foreign Ministry at Berlin against invasion of Russian, territory at Kern via, Finland, and quoting orders issued to the trooxjs of the Russian Republic to offer resistance on the frontier &quot; like an army of a neutral State &quot; would do.Finland.   [See above under Russia.]Lithuania. On April 21st Lord Reading was informed of the policy of the Allies as affecting the Lithuanians. This policy is to give encouragement to opposition offered to the Germans, and also to emphasise the point that the right of the Lithuanians to determine their own fate is acknowledged by the Allies.On April 23rd German Wireless reported that Lithuanian and Esthonian delegates had been received by the Chancellor at Imperial Headquarters. He expressed willingness to take the Diets of these countries under military protection of the German Empire and &quot; after separation from Russia, military, currency, tariff, and customs conventions are to be concluded and .the released countries recognised as independent States.&quot; In another account of the same, date, Count Hertling is represented as having promised support &quot; in the execution of their separation from.! Seized by the Germans.   (See German Wireless of April 24th.)2 Also in Russian Wireless of April 17th, suggesting a Commission to settle details under Clause 3 of the Peace Treaty, as affecting the Navy, and Russian Wireless of April 24th, which assumes that the Germans are &quot;preparing for an actual, if not a formal, blockade of Sebastopol.&quot;.    5481-46 E
Russia,&quot; and declared that &quot;he was prepared, in the name of the Kaiser, to recognise the liberated territories as independent States.&quot; (Sir H. Rumbold reported on April 12th on good authority that the Lithuanian delegates to Berlin were anxious to form a close alliance with Poland and the Ukraine to resist Germany on one side and Bolshevism on the other.)Esllionia, On April 18th Sir E. Howard recommended the publication through Scandinavian countries of the provisional recognition by Germany and Great Britain of the independence of Esthonia.   [See also under Lithuania.]The visit of an Esthonian deputation to Norway was reported by Sir M. Fimliay on April J 7th, to obtain the recognition cf Esthonia&apos;s complete national independence as a neutral state under the guarantee of the Great Powers. The members of the deputation are credited with a statement that the body which telegraphed to the Kaiser was the Landesrat or National Council, which is a parody of national repre-sentation, consisting as it does of 34 Germans, 13 (?) Esthonians, and 11 Letts. The deputation had been well received in Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Christiauia.. Ukraine. German Wireless of April 20th published a message from Kiel? that the Ukrainian Central Rada had declared that the People&apos;.s Republic of Ukrainia does not recognise the incorporation of Bessarabia with Rumania, and is about to send a note of protest on the subject to Rumania and to the Quadruple Alliance.German Wireless of the same date published a further message1 that the proposal of the Russians relating to peace negotiations had been accepted, and they were to take place iu a provincial town in the Province of Kursk. According to another German Wireless report, this conclusion was come to on April 17th by the People&apos;s Ministerial Council of the Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic.   [See also under Russia.]Bessarabia. [See under Ukraine, Rumania, and Turkey.]Rumania. Russian Wireless of April 19th published a very strong protest signed by M. Chicherin. against the annexation of Bessarabia to Rumania, which is described as &quot; not only a challenge to the Russian Federal Councils&apos; Republic, but also a cynical disregard of the agreement concluded between, the Rumanian Government and Russia, to the effect that in the course of three months Bessarabia must be evacuated by Rumanian troops.&quot; The message concludes : &quot; The violent annexation of Bessarabia to Rumania does not break the unity and solidarity of the working-classes of Bessarabia and Russia.&quot;Lord Bertie, on April 20th, forwarded a message dated April 1.9th from the Allied Ministers at Jassy to the effect that they had received official notification from the Rumanian Foreign Minister of the union of Rumania and Bessarabia.German AVireless of April 23rd states that von Kiihlmann, &quot; whose health continues to improve,&quot; will, go to Bucharest at the end of the week to conclude the peace negotiations, and the new Austro-Uungarian Minister will go also -&quot;his visit to the German capital has had to be postponed, until a later date.&quot;[See also under Turkey.]Germany. On April 18th the Political Intelligence Department at the Foreign Office published a confidential paper on the Licbnowsky disclosures and their effect upon public opinion in Germany. These disclosures seem to have elicited but few-public acknowledgments of the fact that Great Britain was in no way responsible for the war, and &quot;these utterances are far outweighed by the chorus of condemnation and abuse of the Ambassador and those who approve of his views.&quot;Sir H. Rumbold on April 20th reported a sudden renewal of their &quot; peace offensive &quot; by the Germans in Switzerland. The line on which the propagandists are working is difficult to reconcile with the military party&apos;s promise of a &quot;strong German, peace.&quot;&apos; It is said by men like Dr. Solf (Colonial Minister) and M. Muller (Editor of Munich Post) now in Switzerland that Germany will propose peace about the middle of May, offering to reconsider the Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest treaties, and to restore Belgian independence. Fears are expressed&quot; of the strangulation of German trade even &quot;if a great victory can be gained in the West, provided that the economic blockade is mantained. Sir II. Rumbold expresses the opinion that the Germans are obliged for various economic reasons to try and obtain a decision of some sort before July.   This1 Corroborated by German Wireless of April 24th, on the authority of the Ukrainian Press Bureau.. The Ukrainian delegation to arrive at Kursk on April 21st.
report of a German peace offensive has received, strong confirmation from Norway in a Military Attached report forwarded hy Sir M. Find lay on April 22 nd.Italian.Wireless of April 23rd calls attention to a speech at Breslau by Prince Fredrick William of Prussia stating that without an indemnity Germany would be ruined economically and unable to compete with other nations.Austria-Hungary. [Sec under France for the Emperor Charles controversy; also under Germany for Baron BuriaiPs movements.]Turkey. Italian Wireless of April 20th stated that relations between Turkey and Bulgaria verge on conflict. Turkey is said to be demanding of Bulgaria the Adrianople-Dedeagatch line as far as the mouth of the Maritza, while Bulgaria claims the entire Dobrudja, and opposes Rumania&apos;s annexation of Bessarabia, at the same time rejecting in a hostile spirit the demands of Turkey.   [See also under Greece.,Bulgaria.   [See under Turkey.&apos;]France. Sir PL Rumbold on April 17th, forwarded information, founded on. good authority, that there were two communications from the Emperor Charles about the French claims to Alsace-Lorraine, one in a footnote to a letter sent by the Empress of Austria to Princess Sarsina early in 1917, the other in the letter to Prince Sixte, referred to by President Clemenceau. In the opinion of the Swiss Government Count Czernin did not know about the existence of either of these letters, ddie)7 also think it is possible that the Duchess of Parma conveyed a misleading impression to the Emperor Charles about the real feeling in France and Italy on the subject of peace.United States. A. suggestion, sent through Lord Bertie (April 18th) has reached the Foreign Office from the Allied Ministers at dassy that it would be desirable for the United States to issue a denial of certain rumours of negotiations between that country and Austria-Hungary, especially as affecting the Balkans.Greece. On April 17th Sir H. Rumbold reported on good authority that Germany had promised the ex-King of Greece that Epirus, Albania, and the islands of the Archipelago occupied by the Italians, would be presented to Greece in return for the surrender of Seres, Drama and Kavalla. It is further reported that the ex-King is endeavouring to obtain German support against a claim by the Turks for Chios and Mityiene.Italy.   [See under Greece.]Great Britain. The Ministry of Labour, in reporting for the week ending April 17th, stated that: &quot; Evidence accumulates that one effect of the success of the German offensive on the West has been to stimulate activity in all essential industries, and it is not anticipated that opposition to the man-power proposals will go the length of sacrificing the vital interests of the country. Labour has been quick to grasp the significance of the threats to Amiens and the coast ports, and as long, as the crucial position on the West continues it seems indubitable that the working classes of the nation will as a whole play their part.&quot;
