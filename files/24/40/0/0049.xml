T3t is The Pie Property ofiiP T &quot;v18th -  4th Jen.1918..KJC.   She United States are now demanding, as a eon&amp;itfonof their proposed agreement with Denmark, that the Danish Government shall &amp;rant a lorn to the Allies.The Danish Government have decided that, as from the com-mencement off 1918, the export      cattle to Germany shall fee limited to 6,000 head a week.   Of late the weekly exports to Germany have averaged between 8,000 and 9,000 head.SWgJQSB.   We have now been waiting for a month to hear whether the Swedish Government will make acceptable proposals regarding (a) the employment of their shipping   (b) the limitation of their iron Q e exports to Germany and   (c) a loan to the Allies, sir E. Howard thinks that the del ey is due, not so much to a de liber ate intention of gaining time, as to fear of German reprisals. The question of iron ore is the main difficulty. She Germans con tend that, as the quantities which they *are receiving do not exceed the pre-war average, it would be an unfriendly act on Bweden&apos;3 part to effect a reduction.   The Swedish Government apprehend that, if they restricted the exports of iron ore to any considerable extent, Sweden would receive no more German coal and Swedish shipping would not be allowed to pass through the Oat teg at.   Sir  . Howard thinks that the Swedish Government may offer to divide the exports of iron ore equally between the Central Powers and the Allies.   But he hopes that we shall not insist upon this settlement, if the Swedes oppose it strongly, oon-sidering that we still depend on Sweden for supplies of military %importance.   There is something to be said in favour of maintaining the status quo.&apos; as the food difficulties of Sweden increase, sae is likely to become more accommodating on the question of iron ore.
J87tittfeantihile the Allies have the use of 300.000 tons deadweight of Swedish shipping*H.M. Government have offered that, if the Swedish Government will accept the proposed provisional shipping agreement, facilities shall be given for the importation into Sweden of limited qusn-tities of fodder stuffs, mineral oil, phosphate rock, coffee, cork, dried fruit and cocoa.The Swedish public are beginning to realise that the excessive price of British coal in Sweden is mainly due to the high freights charged by Swedish shipowners,    he shipowners have accordingly begun to reduce their rates, with the result that the price of British coal in Stockholm has dropped 20$*   We are taking steps to inform the Swedish public that one result of an An^lo-Swedlsh ship] ing agreement would be to make British coal considerably cheaper.It is reported that supplies of lubricating oil, sufficient to meet all the immediate requirements of Swedish transport and industry, will shortly arrive in Sweden from Austria and Houmania.?WI&amp;m,   The foodstuffs which the United States War Board haslicenced for export to Finland ere being sent to Narvik in the charge of an American supercargo.   The American Minister at Stock-holm has been instructed to cooperate with Sir !. Howard in estab-lishing an import trust to control these consignments.   They will be forwarded to the American Consul at Helsingfore, who will srrang with the Finnish Authorities for their distribution.The Germans have offered to supply Finland with Kouaumlan grain in exchange for copper, of which it is said there are 20,000 tons in Finland available for export.   The Finns are however not at present disposed to accept the offer.   Hegular steamers are reported to be running between Germany and Finland, and German exporters are booking orders in Finland.iii OB WAY.   The United States War Board has now handed to Dr. flansen a list of the rations which it is proposed to allow JBlorway.   fh&amp; ,

The United States propose to publish tho list of rations, together with their note of Dec.20 to the Norwegian Government.Although we have ceased to purchase certain kinds of Fish and Fish Products under the Norwegian Fish.

Posthuma, the Minister of Agriculture has publicly promised that he will licence the export of 5,000 horses to Germany.   Some time ago we notified the Dutch Government that   , we should regard such exports as a breach of the Hides Agreement, and the conduct of M,- osthuma is the more provocative since this . question is being discussed in the negotiations for a general agreement with the Netherlands,The Dutch Government have accepted the proposal of the United States War Trade Board that Dutch ships now in American ports shall be chartered to the United States Shipping Board for 90 days.   It is hoped that 150,000 tons of Dutch shipping will,   V under this &quot;arrangement, become available for the service of the Belgian Belief Commission and for carrying grain to Switzerland.H.1.Government have offered to settle the question of Dutch exports of sand and gravel on the basis of   (a) an agreement as to the quantities which may be exported to Belgium from the Netherlands   (b) a satisfactory scheme for controlling the uses o$

sand and gravel which are allowed to pass in transit to Belgium (c) the appointment by the Dutch Government of a referee, who shall be acceptable to H.M. Government to define the military uses of sand and gravel.   If the Dutch Government give their informal assent to these proposals, the embargo on Dutch commercial cables will at once be raised.8PAIS.   The United States Government are on the point of concluding a commercial agreement with Spain.   They have asked whether H.M. Government wish that this agreement should include any stipula-tions ae to the exports y&amp;ich we require from Spain.SWIT^EEL..JD. The S-^isa Government have agreed to submit a scheme for granting to us a monthly credit up to ten million francs.

The Swiss Government are further requested to prohibit absolutely the export of goods containing rubber,   and to taite im-mediate measures for restricting and controlling the accumulation of stocks which are intended for export to the Central Empires after the war.The United States Government are unable to supply wheat for Switzerland, and have decided that all S^iss supplies must be drawn from the Argentine.Mia&amp;P STATUS.   The United States Government propose that British letters of assurance should no longer be required for goods ex-ported under licence from the U.S.A,   They also ask that vessels sailing from United States ports should no longer be required to call at Halifax.   The first proposal may be accepted by H.M,
Government if the United States Government will formally agree to ta^e our opinion on applications for export licences, and not to override any objection which we make in a particular case without consulting us further,    here are however serious objections to abolishing the examination at Halifax.gjj&amp;fog SUB&amp;lfilJSUB BLQUjl 1)K.
