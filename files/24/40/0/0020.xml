SECRET.

G.T. 3420.

WAR CABINET.

PROBABLE DECLINE IN POWER OF BOLSHEVIKS.

Copy of telegram No.180 from Mr. Lindley (Petrograd) to the Foreign Office, 20th January, 1918.

(Circulated as a War Cabinet Paper at the request of Lord Robert Cecil.)

Messrs. Shingaroff and Kokoshkin members of Provisional Government and of Constituent Assembly were murdered last night by Red Guards in a hospital to which they had removed from fortress. This is probably the beginning of reign of terror which will gradually be extended to the whole middle-class population. I am inclined to think the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly will be the high water mark of Bolshevik power and that decline may be expected to set in first in the provinces end finally in Petrograd. As the Bolsheviks see power slipping from them their violence will increase.
