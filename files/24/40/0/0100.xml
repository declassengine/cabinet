COMMITTEE ON LIQUOR TRADE (SCOTLAND).REPORT.To The Right Hon. Robert Munro, His Majesty&apos;s Secretary eor Scotland.Sir,-1. The terms of the remit made are as printed. - All those named in the remit accepted office.PRELIMINARY.2. It became almost immediately evident that it was impossible for the Committee to conduct the investigations necessary to enable it to obtain materials for a report merely by sittings in London. Sittings were also accordingly held in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Aberdeen. The representatives of the trade manufacturing and supplying intoxicating liquors asked further time to prepare the evidence to be laid before the Committee, and this request was granted. The sittings, which ended at Aberdeen on Thursday, 2nd August, were accordingly resumed at Edinburgh on Thursday, 23rd August, and continued in that city much evidence being obtained from the trade at these sittings. Finally, in London, in October, further evidence was taken, and thereafter meetings were held to consider the terms of this report.TERMS OF REMIT AND SCOPE OF COMMITTEES RESPONSIBILITY.The Committee now begs to transmit to you the report which it has framed. .    3. As arising out of the terms of the remit made, the Committee begs to note that: (1) It is in no way responsible for any question of policy in regard to the matter of State purchase. The opinion on that subject which is recorded in the remit is the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s.Government.. That opinion is stated in this form, &quot; That it may shortly be necessary as an urgent war measure to assume control of the manufacture and supply of intoxicating liquors during the war and the period of demobilisation, and that such control would involve the purchase after the war. of the interests con-cerned in such manufacture and supply.&quot;(2) With regard to the question of control, the Committee is charged only with reporting upon &quot;the financial arrangements which should be made for the period of control.&quot; The Committee would have accordingly considered it beyond its province to enter into any questions as to the form in which control should be assumed, or in regard to the practical details and shape in which such control should be carried out.(3) By the terms of the remit, however, the question of control cannot be dissociated from that of State purchase : for His Majesty&apos;s Governments opinion is expressed to this effect, namely : &quot; Such control would involve the purchase after the war of the interests concerned in such manufacture and supply.&quot; It is this kind of control a control which would involve purchase after the war that the Committee has been asked to have in its view in making its inquiry and report.&quot;CONTROL WHICH WOULD INVOLVE PURCHASE.&quot;  COMMITTEES OPINION.4. The Committee may first deal with the point just mentioned. It may be well at once to state the opinion upon it which, after full consideration, it has formed. A control which involves such a purchase would substantially be a control of other people&apos;s property by the Government, coupled with an intimation that they must part with that property after it had for a time been controlled. If the management of the Drink Trade were management of a trade which proceeded upon simple commercial lines that were not the subject of interference by legislative or departmental action, or by changes involved in local administration, it might be possible to figure a feasible case of control with purchase afterwards, as that case would simply be one of taking over the management on old lines, continuing those lines, and postponing the date of acquisition.5. But in regard to control of the Liquor Trade, the case and what is no doubt meant by the Government in this remit is entirely different. Control of the Liquor Trade, to be effective in the sense indicated, must be control which permits of complete freedom of action on the part of the Controller. And this freedom of action may result in the suppression of many places of business, the consolidation of many others, the complete change in schemes of management, and, stated generally, an alteration at the hand and according to the will of a Central Authority which views the Scottish drink problem as a whole as well as considers the wants of particular localities, and which has complete freedom to adjust local conditions, including businesses and their management, to those wants. Any control short of that would be devoid of either business or public advantage.6. But if such control be exercised, it is manifest that when purchase comes to be made after the
-war, purchase of the property then would require to proceed upon a largely imaginary footing, namely, on the footing that the period of disfranchisement of the licensees and owners, with all that had occurred during that period, was to stand out of the reckoning so as to arrive at the first element of the calculation, namely, a pre-war purchase datum. And the very things reckoned out would in many cases reappear in the process of getting the interests justly assessed as at the date of purchase ; while in many other cases it is easy to figure confusing claims of compensation owing to the alterations or loss produced on the subject of sale before the date of actual acquisition. The Committee sees no advantage in a proceeding of this character.7. Furthermore, it desires to observe that the position of licensees and others interested in the trade, both of manufacture and of supply, would be, from a business point of view, quite mishandled under such an arrangement. Nominally remaining proprietors of their concerns, they would not be allowed to manage them, either to their own advantage or with a view to prospective interests. They would have no elective control over the concern; they would merely stand by and observe what the prospective purchaser and interim possessor was making of the subject of the transaction. The Com-mittee cannot see how the interests of either the State or of society could be promoted by any arrange-ment of the kind. In short, if the State is to purchase these interests at all, the postponement of the transaction for a period of control seems not to be justified by any considerations of a social or a com-mercial character.   If purchase is to take effect, it should take effect as from the date of control.8. The Committee accordingly finds itself unable to recommend any financial terms upon which control should be assumed during the period intervening before the transaction of purchase is con-cluded. It is quite possible, of course, that the transaction of purchase might be settled, with the pay-ment of the price postponed till after the war and demobilisation, and with fair interest paid upon that price in the meantime by the State to the sellers. This would be unobjectionable from a business point of view, and it would leave the hands of all parties free on the one side, the State having corti-plete power of controlling what would then be its own; and on the other, those interested in the trade being free, knowing their financial position, to enter upon other spheres of industry.CONTROL: SUBJECT ILLUSTRATED BY ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALCONTROL BOARD.9. The Committee is confirmed in this view by the action of the Board of Control, which was recently appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In pursuance of the Defence of the Realm (No. 3) Act, 1915, and Regulations thereunder of His Majesty in Council, that Board has issued Orders applying to about nine-tenths of the area of Scotland. Over that wide area it has, inter alia, greatly limited the hours of trade, and has forbidden treating and credit. The Orders first issued were seven in number, and they are set forth at length in the second report of the Board (Cd. 8117). But apart from general regulation there were two areas where, active and effectual control in the full sense had to be taken in hand. These areas were Gretna and Invergordon. In both of those areas it was found that this Board, although appointed purely for emergency purposes, was unable to accomplish the control which would be effective except by the exercise of powers of acquisition of the premises controlled.10. It may be well to note how this stands. It is regulated by Section 1 (2) of the Defence Act already cited. That sub-section gave power to His Majesty in Council to.issue regulations, and (6) reads as follows : &quot;For giving the prescribed Government authority&quot; (the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) was appointed that authority) &quot; power to acquire compulsorily or by agreement, and either for the period during which the regulations take effect or permanently, any licensed or other premises or business in the area or any interest therein so far as it appears necessary or expedient to do so, for the purpose of giving proper effect to the control of the liquor supply in the area.&quot;11. The necessity for the Board being vested with such powers, and the advantage of their being put into operation, became immediately evident. What has been done thereunder appears from the reports issued by that Board. As illustrating, however, the dependence of control upon the actual right and power to buy up the businesses, it may be mentioned that in the Gretna district, after a survey, it was found that it was necessary to add to the area to be operated upon, and to exercise powers of purchase over the entire territory so increased. One instance may suffice to indicate the nature of what was done. In the town of Annan there existed, in addition to hotels and public-houses, no less than eight licensed grocers&apos; premises. What the Board of Control did was to buy up the whole of these businesses, to extinguish the licenses in every one of them, and to set up one place of business in the burgh for off-sale. The instance is only cited as showing that the exercise of the power of purchase permits of such a new situation being created as can enable control in a proper business sense to be effected.12. It is quite easily possible to figure the confusion which would have resulted had the Board of Control been placed in a position in which immediate purchase was forbidden, and control yet demanded, together with the necessity for an ultimate clearing up of the situation after such control was ended so as to effectuate purchase at that later date. Looking over the operations of the Board of Control in the two districts already mentioned, the Committee finds strong confirmation of the opinion which it has formed, that if purchase by the State is in view, an interregnum of control, apart from acquisition but with a view to subsequent purchase, is unwise, and would be confusing and impracticable.13. Before leaving this topic the Committee desires to observe that the control pointed to is something essentially different from the issue of Regulations or Orders of a general character for the conduct of the drink business in localities or throughout the country. Such Regulations or Orders are now familiar to the public. Affecting as they may do, say, the hours of trading, prescribing the materials to be sold, or forbidding treating or sales upon credit, they in one sense are of a constraining or controlling character. They may have their great value and uses; and they may alter and modify business done; but so far
as the work of the present Committee is concerned, they do not involve subsequent purchase, and do hot fall within the remit.14. The question before the Committee is thus confined to the important topic of what the terms and conditions of State purchase of the liquor trade in Scotland should be, should Parliament resolve upon such a transaction.THE STATE VIEWED AS PROSPECTIVE BUYER.15. Under the terms of inquiry and report, the position of the trade was substantially that of pro-spective sellers. This being so, the Committee made a communication to the Government to the effect that in its view it might be advantageous if the Government itself, acting through the Treasury, would come before the Committee and frankly adopt the position of prospective purchaser.16. It would then have been open to the Committee to consider the case of purchase and sale as presented from both sides, and to form and state an opinion on the business proposition thus presented. The Government, however, did not see its way to accede to this request. The idea ot the Committee, accordingly, that it might obtain some view, at least a general view, as to what the Government&apos;s opinion was as to the principles of adjustment as well as of the amount involved in the transaction which was contemplated, could not in this form be satisfied.17. But the Government placed at the command of the Committee the&apos;services of Mr D. N. Cotton, Chartered Accountant, Edinburgh, and the Committee desires to record its sense of the value of his-assistance in the analysis of statistics and accounts placed before it.18. It was also thought right to consider the question from a different point of view than that of ascertaining the terms of the purchase by a mere criticism of the demands made by the prospective sellers.19. Mr Blair, the chief valuer of licenses in Scotland for the Inland Revenue Department, laid before the Committee the results of careful and elaborate analysis of the amounts paid on the head of goodwill of licensed businesses, as such goodwill was fixed and assessed for the purpose of the payment of death-duties. Certain further information was also obtained from the Income Tax Authorities. Incidentally, facts were also elicited as to prices paid in private transactions; and the Secretary of the Board of Control, together with two valuers, one Mr Walks and the other Mr Fraser, both gentlemen of the highest skill, put the Committee in possession of the principles and results in regard to the not inconsiderable number of licensed businesses acquired by that Board. In this way the Committee is able to express the opinion that it has obtained much light on the subject of its report, and light derived not by a pre-sentation of the case from the two extremes, but from actual dealings as between the trade, on the one hand, and the State itself on the other. It may, indeed, be a queston whether results so obtained are not safer by the latter method than by that of arbitrament between two sides, already mentioned.RELATION OF STATE TO LIQUOR TRADE IN SCOTLAND: (1) GENERAL.20. The position of the liquor interest in Scotland in its relation to the State is in many essential particulars strikingly different from that in England. It is unnecessary in this Report to enter upon many of the details of such difference. But the situation of the licensee for the sale of intoxicating liquor in Scotland in respect to his rights and the nature of his property under the license, and also in respect to the numerous restrictions under which his trade is carried on, appears to the Committee to be relevant to this inquiry, and it accordingly begs to remind you, in general terms, of how the facts and history of these topics stand.21. A synopsis of these was made in the Report of the Peel Commission, issued in the year 1899. Following upon that Report, the English statutes of 1902 and 1904 and the Licensing (Scotland) Act, 1903 were passed. But the last-named statute did not satisfy the public demand throughout Scotland, which followed in particular upon various recommendations contained in the Report of the Minority of the Peel Commission. After a period of ten years&apos; agitation upon the subject of further temperance legislation, the Scotch Act of 1913, however, reached the statute-book.22. It had previously passed through the House of Commons in the year 1912, and it ultimately became law as the result of the pressure of the Parliament Act and of consequent negotiations and corn-promise arranged substantially between the two great-parties in the State, as well as between the two Houses of Parliament.23. Under the Act local option was introduced. The principal difference which had ultimately remained between the two Houses was the settling of the period of what is known as the time limit, under which the local option provisions could not be put into operation for a considerable term of years. These topics will be presently alluded to.RELATION OF STATE TO LIQUOR TRADE IN SCOTLAND: (2) HISTORICAL.24. About the middle of the eighteenth century the English licensing system is said, by the Peel Commission, to have been &quot; imposed upon Scotland.&quot; But no license was required for the sale of whisky in Scotland prior to the year 1793, and even then no certificate was required by the keepers of houses near military roads. Certain legislative changes occurred in the beginning of the nineteenth century, but in the year 1828 the foundation of the present system was laid by setting up and giving jurisdiction to licensing authorities. These authorities in the course of the ensuing ninety years have been subject to change from time to time, some of the most notable of these changes being consequent upon the altera-tions of qualifications of occupants of the licensing bench.25. The Committee proceeds at once to inquire what was the hold or grasp which the State retained, and from time to time increased upon the trade thus licensed. By the Home-Drummond Act of 1828 the first inroad was made upon the liberty of the licensee to sell liquor at any horn, day or night. A prohibition of sale was made during the hours of Divine Service on Sundays.  In 1853 the Forbes-
Mackenzie Act, which was one of great importance, was passed. The sale of liquor on Sunday was entirely prohibited, except to those lodging in an hotel or to a bonafide traveller. In additionto this one day a week being cut off, closing hours were introduced. Liquor could not be sold or consumed in licensed premises between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. In 1862, 1876, and 1877 various Acts were passed which did not affect the hours of business, but dealt with offences and with matters of procedure applicable to Licensing Courts. In 1887, however, an important Act was passed under which the Licensing Authority in Scotland was vested with a discretion to fix the hour of closing (11 p.m.) as early as 10 p.m. on week-days. It is a somewhat remarkable fact that within a very limited space of time the licensing authori-ties over the whole area of Scotland took advantage of this power, and 10 p.m. became the closing hour.26. An exception to this rule, however, had been introduced into the statute at the instance of the House of Lords, the exception of any towns of more than 50,000 inhabitants. After sixteen years, namely, with the Act of 1903, this exception was taken away, and it was made permissible, at thedis-cretion of the licensing authorities, to compel closing at 10 p.m. in the large towns. Again, within a very limited time, this discretion was universally exercised, and 10 p.m. became the evening closing hour throughout Scotland.27. In 1903 important further changes in respect of closing were introduced. Licensing Courts were authorised to make byelaws closing licensed premises wholly or partially on New Year&apos;s Day. and on not more than four other days in any year. Then in the Act of 1913 the closing horns were attacked from the other end, and the statutory hour of opening was made 10 a.m. instead of 8 a.m. Finally, and as part of the emergency war legislation, the hours of business in something like nine-tenths of the entire area of Scotland were drastically reduced, and closing was made compulsory except between the hours of 12 a.m. and 2.30 p.m., and of 6.30 p.m. and 9 p.m. on five days of the week, and on Saturday, except from 4 p.m. till 9 p.m.28. This statement as to restriction has been confined, as has been seen, in the first place to the hours of trade, and it will be observed that the community, acting by force of the discretion vested in licensing and other authorities by statute, has subjected the carrying on of this business to an ever-increasing restriction. It should be added that one necessary consequence of this has been thus to place the trade more and more under effective police supervision.29. It may next be mentioned that, in the course of the legislation alluded to, certain considerable changes were effected with regard to the granting or renewal of licenses. Reference in particular is made to the Act of 1896, which provided that the refusal of a new application should be final; there was no right of appeal. Before that date an appeal was possible against a refusal to grant a new certi-ficate. The finality attaching to a refusal of a new license by the first Court was an important change. Further, when a new license was not refused, but was granted, then in that case the grant required to be confirmed by what is called a Confirmation Court. The double effect of these provisions accordingly operated in the direction of considerably restricting the chances of new licenses being obtained, and local control was thus accentuated.30. The trade was thus increasingly under supervision and restriction ; and in most of the instances cited, as will be well known, there is no similarity between the laws of Scotland and of England. To take the broadest of all contrasts, that of Sunday closing, the difference between the two countries is strikingly manifest.RELATION OF STATE TO LIQUOR TRADE IN SCOTLAND:  (3) STRIKING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SCOTCH AND ENGLISH CASES.31. But a still further difference has now to be noted, namely, between the essential nature of the right of the licensee north and south of the Tweed. After the decision of Sharp v. Wakefield, the English statute of 1904 enacted provisions the subject of much controversj&apos; and discussion under which the principle of compensation, out of funds provided by the trade, was recognised. Some-what elaborate machinery was set up on this subject. The discretionary powers of the authorities to refuse the renewal of a license received a severe check. The power to refuse old on-licenses, except upon the grounds of misconduct, etc., was vested in the Compensation Authority and not in the Licensing Justices, and could not be exercised except upon payment of compensation under the Act. It is unneces-sary to enter into this subject further than to state that the position of the holder of a license as thus, fortified, the discretion of the licensing authorities as thus limited, and the entire scheme of compensation find no analogy in any Scottish legislation.32. The contrast between the two cases has been often publicly recognised, and in the House of Lords on 9th August 1904, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, the Secretary for Scotland from 1895 to 1903, stated, with, so far as the Committee is aware, the entire approval of all sections of the community in Scotland, the matter thus on the question of the provisions for the extinction of licenses by way of compensation for the trade: &quot; If anything in the nature of the English Bill were to apply to Scotland, we should be in an infinitely worse position than at the present time. I am apprehensive that an attempt may be made to extend the general principle of this Bill to Scotland, and I wish to take this opportunity of saying that there is such a difference in the circumstances of the two countries that it would be an act of gross injustice to apply the principle in this Bill to the country north of the Tweed.&quot;33. The Committee shares the views laid before it by the Under-Secretary for Scotland, that Scottish legislation substantially followed the lines of the Report of the Minority of the Peel Commission rather than that of the Majority. His Majesty&apos;s Government may further be reminded that in that Report the general position on this matter was thus stated: &quot;In Scotland there has never been the slightest doubt as to the state of the law ; the absolute discretion of the licensing authority over all kinds of certi-ficates, without any exception, has always been recognised. It is true that in some parts of Scotland certificates have been renewed from year to year without much question, but anyone investing in a public-house ought to have done so with the full knowledge of the law, which is stated on the face of the certi-ficate-&apos; This certificate to continue in force from to and no longer.&apos; &quot;   That
period is either a six months&apos; or a twelve months&apos; period; generally the latter. The Report further states: &quot; No Scottish Sharp v. Wakefield was ever possible, because the fact was clear. In Scotland, too, as we have seen, the certificate is more personal to the holder, and the owner of the premises is not recog-nised by the law. The landlord has no vested interest in any increase in value through the granting of a license.&quot;34. The majority of the Commissioners made a proposal, the general effect of which favoured a gradual reduction of licenses by compulsory selection, with compensation by contributions from the trade itself. They did not propose any distinct time limit, although they indicated that this reduction might take place in cycles of seven years. The Minority Report, on the other hand, while accepting the principle of com-pensation by the trade over a single period of seven years, made proposals by which that single period of seven years should be regarded as a time limit for compensation, after which the coast should be.more or less clear, and in Scotland and Wales they added &quot; clear for local option.&quot; This is the form in which Sir James Dodds expresses the general result of the treatment of the topic by the Peel Commission. The Act of 1913, however, has put an end to such discussions as to policy, and the Committee, and in its opinion the country, must recognise that the projected scheme of State purchase must be considered solely with reference to the rights and interests both of the trade and of the State as on the basis of &quot;the law of Scotland as it at present stands.THE TEMPERANCE (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1913.35. That is contained in the Act of Parliament of the year- 1913. The Act comes into effect on 1st June 1920. As its true object and its consequences are still the subject of extreme controversy, Section 2 of the statute had better be quoted just as it stands.   It is in the following terms : &quot; 2. (1) If, in the manner hereinafter provided, a requisition demanding a poll under this Act in any area is found by the Local Authority to have been duly signed, the Local Authority shall cause a poll of the electors in such area (hereinafter called &apos; a poll&apos;) to be taken in accordance with the provisions of this Act/&quot; (2) The questions to be submitted to the electors at a poll shall be the adoption in and for such area of (a) a no-change resolution, or (6) a limiting resolution, or (c) a no-license resolution.&quot; (3) On a poll in any area : &quot; (a) If 55 per cent, at least of the votes recorded are in favour of a no-license resolution, and not less than 35 per cent, of the electors for such area on the register have voted in favour thereof, such resolution shall be deemed to be carried ; or if&quot; (6) A majority of the votes recorded are in favour of a limiting resolution, and not less than 35 per cent, of the electors for such area on the register have voted in favour thereof, such resolution shall be deemed to be carried ; or if&quot; (c) A majority of the votes recorded are in favour of a no-change resolution, or if no other resolution is carried, a no-change resolution shall be deemed to be carried ; and any such resolution so carried shall come into force on the twenty-eighth day of May immediately following the taking of the poll.&quot; (4) Au elector shall not be entitled to vote for more than one of the resolutions submitted at the poll, but if a no-license resolution be not carried, the votes recorded in favour of such resolu-tion shall be added to those recorded in favour of the limiting resolution, and shall be deemed to have been recorded in favour thereof.&quot; (5) Any such resolution if carried shall remain in force until the resolution is repealed or superseded as hereinafter provided.&quot;36. Section 3 is executorial and deals with the effect of the resolution as carried, and the conse-quential action of the licensing authorities. Section 4 deals with the subject of resolutions at further polls. Stated generally, the effect is that the situation as fixed at one poll cannot be reviewed or altered except after an interval of three years.THE TIME LIMIT.37. The Act, as already stated, does not come into operation until 1st June 1920. This postpone-ment constituted the time limit. It was the subject of serious contest, and was undoubtedly dealt with in connection with the topic of compensation. The principle of the time limit, it was urged, was necessary in order to enable the trade to set its house in order, particularly by the method of insurance, so as to create such funds as appeared to be requisite to compensate the individual trader against the closing of his house by reason of the action of the community under the Act. This time limit was conceded, and a struggle ensued as to the period. The Peel Minority Report had recommended seven years&apos; time limit in England and five years in Scotland. The period first asked by the trade was fourteen years ; the period proposed by the House of Lords was ten years; the finarperiod inserted in the Act was eight years from 1st June 1912 (the measure although passed in 1913 having been before both Houses in the previous year, 1912). It is, therefore, correct to say that the reaching of the time limit was by way of a compromise as to period.38. The nature of the time limit itself appears to the Committee to be substantially this: no legal right or claim existed hi licenses which could be pleaded as enabling them to resist the non-renewal by the restrictive or prohibitive option of the community. Although, however, they could not say that they had any such right or claim at law, still, having put out certain expenses, and having, it may be, been in the regular enjoyment of a course of trade, there was, it was urged, a certain equitable claim for consideration which fell to be recognised by the State in the new enactment. On the ground of this equitable claim, immediate local option was resisted, and by the consent of the State the exercise of the
option was deferred. The time limit was set up postponing for a period of years the direct, and it might possibly be the sweeping action of the community at the poll. If that direct or sweeping action had been immediate it would have come upon the trade at a time when they were un prepared, and had not been allowed to prepare for what to them, or in individual cases, might have very serious financial results. Com-pensation as against that sudden action could have been pleaded for in a way that was rendered impossible after the granting of a time limit. This latter operation therefore put at rest all questions of compensation for cessation or dispossession of business consequent upon the exercise of the rights of suppression, total or partial, vested in localities by the Act.LIMITATIONS OF TEMPERANCE (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1913.39. The Act of 1913 does not apply to the manufacture of drink; nor does it affect the supply of drink under excise license. Indeed, it has been pointed out by a leading brewer that notwithstand-ing the statute it would be open to brewers to supply direct to consumers under their excise licenses. So far as the text of the Act is concerned it would, be legal to do so in quantities of not less than 4J gallons. And it is to be pointed out the effect of the Act is confined to the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors in the particular area. So far as accomplishing suppression of sale for consumption is concerned, such points have to be kept in view, but any change in regard thereto is not a matter for the Committee but solely for the Legislature.WIDE EFFECT OF ACT OF 1913:   IMPORTANCE ON VALUES.40. But while the Act only applies to those businesses which require a magisterial certificate or license, the effect is notwithstanding very wide. According to the Judicial Statistics for the year 1916, corrected by information received from public authorities, licenses in Scotland are granted to 1533 inns and hotels, 5024 public-houses, and 3301 grocers&apos; premises. One fact on this branch of the subject may be noted as of interest, viz. that, whereas in England at least 90 per cent, of the public-houses are tied houses, in Scotland tied houses are practically unknown. In England accordingly the public-house question is largely almost entirely a brewers&apos; question; in Scotland it is not so. A license in Scotland is a personal license; this is repeated again and again by magistrates in Licensing Courts, which take careful stock of the character and record of the individual applicant. It is the case that a species of tie does sometimes exist by reason of a brewer or distiller having made a loan to the publican or hotel-keeper, but this, if the circumstance is disclosed before the Licensing Court, is either ignored or certainly carries no weight in the applicants favour.41. It was upon this large class of cases numbering between nine and ten thousand, those, that is to say, that directly cater to the general public and intimately affect the habits and expenditure of the people, that the agitation of so many years and the legislation referred to was brought to bear. It will be observed accordingly how very deeply the Scottish legislation cuts into the question of values, and indeed into the whole subj ect of the inquiry. When the valuation of these businesses comes to be dealt with, the effect of the advent of local option will be adverted to. Whether, and in what directions and to what extent, local option will be exercised must in the opinion of the Committee have a substantial bearing upon existing values. On a forecast of this kind it is possible that temperance organisations operating through-out most of Scotland might have been able to put experience and opinion and possibly helpful facts before the Committee; but evidence from that quarter, notwithstanding full opportunity offered, not having been given, the Committee took care to elicit the views of important witnesses, such as the Lords Provost and Chief Constables of leading burghs, who were acquainted not only with local feeling, but with the practice and modes of action of the Licensing Courts. In the result the Committee has reached the conclusions after stated on the value question.TEMPERANCE (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1913 :  MARKS DEFINITE STAGE.42. But in the Committee&apos;s opinion it would be lacking in its duty if it failed to make clear to the Government the following : The power of communities in Scotland over the prohibition and restriction of licenses has in the Act of 1913 reached a clear and definite stage. What has been accomplished after a protracted struggle cannot be surrendered. The point, according to some witnesses, that suggested serious doubt abqut even the holding of an inquiry was that it seemed to give some countenance to the idea of purchase of the same thing as has already had the time limit applied to it, in the sense of admitting compensation in, it might be, a good man)&apos;- cases of licensed businesses with regard to which the proba-bilities were that suppression would have been secured under the statute without any compensation money. It cannot be denied that this is a forcible consideration. But what was agreed upon on all hands was that any measure which deprived the localities of the powers of local option won for them under the Act would be a public wrong. The Committee shares this opinion. If purchase by the Central Authority were to be projected with the object or were to have the result of setting up drink businesses in localities from which the direct vote of the people had excluded them, there would, to the sense of many already mentioned, be added a great cause of social irritation. Purchase to block prohibition would be widely and vehemently, and in the opinion of the Committee properly, resented. The Committee cannot assume that any Government would propose or Parliament would sanction such a course. It assumes the opposite, and makes its Report upon that footing.STATE PURCHASE WITH LOCAL OPTION UNIMPAIRED: POSSIBLEEFFECTS ON PROHIBITION.43. There remains accordingly this opposite view, viz. that the trade might be bought out by the State, but upon the footing that the powers of the localities and voters therein as they stand on the :statute-book are left unimpaired. This was the subject of anxious inquiry, and as bearing upon the problem of State acquisition the Committee may state the result.44. The &quot; trade &quot; in Scotland is highly organised, and its interests in Scotland, which appear to be
amply equipped with means, are defended with vigilance and vigour and with great ability. The work of these organisations becomes a not unimportant factor in political and municipal contests. It is practically certain that when the options under the Scottish Temperance Act come to be exercised, the influence of these organisations will be brought to bear upon the voter ad hoc, in strong reinforcement of those appeals on the ground of the individual hardships of dispossession which are the everyday experience of Licensing Courts. With purchase by the State, the whole of this class of organisation and influence and argument would disappear. The evidence shows that this being so, the chances of a free and unbiassed expression of opinion would be much fairer. The voter would no longer be beset by the appeals of private interest; what would remain would be his interest as a general taxpayer alongside of his experience and views of local and social welfare.45. The Committee thinks it right on this subject to put on record that the opinions placed before it to the effect that the pathway to local prohibition would be smoothed, and the rate both of restriction and prohibition would be accelerated by the elimination of private interest, were well informed and extremely weighty. It may refer, for instance, to that especially of the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, who, in addition to now being Chief Magistrate, has for many years sat as member of Council for the Canongate Ward (one of the poorer districts of Edinburgh), and has thus had special opportunities of becoming acquainted with the difficulties of the problem. Lord Provost Taggert of Aberdeen expressed himself thus : Being asked, &quot;You do attach considerable importance to the influence of the trade when that poll comes on ? &quot; he replies, &quot; No doubt about that. If the State make the purchase before that time, then that influence would be taken away, and I should say that that would make a considerable difference in the vote. There is a personal sympathetic feeling towards members of the trade. If that influence was taken away I do think that the vote would be more towards prohibition.&quot; While none of the witnesses committed themselves, or were asked to commit themselves to the policy of purchase, yet according to this important evidence, local opinion being left to operate, State purchase would hasten prohibition. The task of the Committee, however, must be to treat things on their existing footing, and as bearing upon the life and values of these businesses the trade is entitled in its statement of the chances of prohibition or restriction not to put to an underestimate the powers which under the present system it would undoubtedly wield upon the vote, and in the direction of no change. By &quot; prohibition &quot; the Committee, of course, must be taken to mean the passing of a no-license resolution under the Statute of 1913.ALLIED TRADES.46. The Committee would now be prepared to proceed with the main problem, and to take first in order the case of certificated houses, and in connection therewith the other trades such as wine merchants which directly supply the consuming public.   -47. But apart from that main problem there were two sets of claims which the Committee was asked to consider, and which it may be well at once to dispose of. These claims were; first, that on behalf of Allied Trades; and second, that on behalf of dependent interests. In regard to both of these cases the Committee was informed that assurances had been given by members of the Government that the cases would be considered. Had it not been for this fact, the Committee would have seriously considered whether the evidence was strictly relevant to the subject of the remit; but in the circumstances mentioned it was thought right not to shut out the representatives who offered themselves for examina-tion, and accordingly their statements were taken.48. The principal interest, and one which might be taken as representative of the Allied Trades, was that of the Maltsters&apos; Association. So far as the extent of that trade is concerned, this is in Scotland relatively small. The majority of the brewers in Scotland are their own malsters, and their make is 1,172,000 quarters. The proportion of malt made and sold by members of the Maltsters&apos; Association for the purpose of the trade in Scotland to brewers was only 50,000 quarters, so that it will be at once seen that the dimensions of the question are very limited.49. Upon the point of principle involved, the Committee has come to the conclusion that these Allied Trades have no just claim to be participants in, or to be provided for, under a scheme purchase of the liquor trade. They were dealers in ordinary course of business with that trade. It is admitted that the traders might have ceased their custom with them, and proceeded to supply themselves like other concerns, in which case no right, legal or otherwise, could have emerged from such a change in the market. Yet, seeing that the State may make a transaction on a large scale, and that, in short, it is the State, there is, it is said, room for the preferment of a claim. The Committee cannot recognise this posi-tion. It is involved in the ordinary purchase of a business for full value that the buyer has the ordinary rights to stop, it or to carry it on, and if the latter, then to place his orders for goods or service where he will.   Such a purchaser is neither hampered in this elementary liberty nor penalised for using it,50. But the Committee think it right, in the first place, to state its definite and clear opinion to the following effect. It views with apprehension the suggestion that the State in entering into a transaction of purchase should tie its hands, binding itself to carry on business in this, that, or the other channel, or for this, that, or the other price or period of time, the State on breach of this obligation to be faced with claims it might be very serious claims of compensation. To give one instance which will occur to anyone who knows the general history and law of the question in Scotland-the freedom of the State as purchaser, or of the localities affected, to limit or to stop the trade might be thereby gravely hampered and impaired; and any arrangement directly or indirectly of that character would be justly resented as an unwise entanglement, improperly made with outside interests.51. But the Committee further desires to observe that whether the trade is or is not continued by the State after purchase, and in what manner it might be continued, are questions of public policy, and. that these things form in its judgment no part of the conditions of purchase. What would happen to the trade after purchase will be for determination by the Parliament and Government of the day, and on the occasion of particular steps being adopted, or arrangements being made, the administration will no doubt proceed upon the fair and ordinary principles of commercial transactions.
ALLIED TRADES : RAMIFICATIONS OF CLAIMS.52. The case submitted by the Maltsters&apos; Association has been referred to. But if once the principle alleged to be covered by such expressions as &quot; interests &quot; and &quot; allied trades &quot; is admitted, there seems to be little limit to the demands which would be made upon the State-to the remotest corners of con-sequential damage. There may, of course, be special and most exceptional cases ; but it may, in general terms, be accepted that the law and practice of the country decline to sanction such a principle. Where a business of a composite character is broken up, say a hotel or a grocery business, in which the sale of liquors under a license forms part of the everyday management and working of the concern, then the possessor of the business may be well entitled to say that the unlicensed remainder of his business, and so the entirety of the concern, may be injuriously affected. That is an interest he is entitled to put forward and to protect. But where none of a claimants business is bought, and he stands at arm&apos;s length from the drink trade as the owner of a separate concern which has business relations with licensed dealers, he may no doubt have lost his merchant, and may or may not get another, but this circumstance seems in no way to confer upon him any right to be compensated for loss of custom. Where there are current contracts that is a different affair ; these must be fulfilled ; and it would not be just that the State as a purchaser should escape from this duty or its equivalent in compensation. But where there is no current contract, both parties were free to give or take supplies, and this freedom continues in the new circumstances and change of the market. It does not appear to the Committee legitimate to place a heavier or different responsibility upon the State than upon any other buyer of an independent concern. It seems fairly clear that in prdinary commercial dealings such a clog is unknown and would be reckoned intolerable.53. How far a departure from these views would lead is well illustrated by the cases in hand. And it is, in the opinion of the Committee, not unimportant to enumerate the species of claims which have been indicated as falling under the head of Allied Trades. Maltsters would present claims for the malt-ing trade which they were in the habit of doing with certain private brewers; coopers similarly would present claims, and have indicated such, because the)r might lose trade in making barrels for private customers; the iron trade are interested, because the cooperage of the barrels involves a considerable demand for iron hoops ; bottle-makers and cork-cutters, who supply the goods of their trade to distillers and brewers, would present claims; the printers who print labels and, in short, every concern which does business with the main trade which is the subject of the transaction of purchase can, if such an open-ing under the head of Allied Trades be permitted, make a claim equally well founded for consideration in money. This is neither conjecture nor exaggeration. And the Committee thinks it right to cite the following passage from a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Committee by the Chairman of the Allied Brewery Traders&apos; Association : &quot; The chief Trades represented in the Association are the Malting Trade, Hop Trade, Brewing Sugar Trade, Brewing Materials Trade, Brewers&apos; Grains, Engineering, Cooperage, and Building Trades ; distributing trades, comprising manufacturers of jars, bottles, crates, corks, stoppers, and like trades. In addition to these there are numerous trades, such as Architects, Bill-posters, Waggon Builders, Ironmongers, and many other trades closely allied to the Brewing Industry, who are all appreciably affected by any legislation which concerns the Brewing Trade.&quot; On their merits the Committee thinks that these claims are unjustifiable ; that they should not be recognised by the State; that the freedom of the State should not be impaired by any consideration that such re-cognition falls to be considered; and, finally, the Committee repeat that so far as purchase by the State of the liquor trade is concerned, it does not think that these items are involved in or properly bear upon that topic.SUBSIDIARY INTERESTS: EMPLOYES; DIRECTORS.54. The same principles apply substantially to what may be termed the subsidiary interests Speak-ing generally, the Committee has observed with a certain amount of surprise that the claim suggested-by the whole of these interests, from directors, managers, and secretaries down to the humblest employes, is based upon the idea that, when the State acquires the trade, those engaged in that trade become persons who, at the moment of acquisition upon their record of service prior to that event, should be dealt with on the same principles as would have applied to them had they been all along civil servants. It is admitted that no scheme of pensions or retiring allowances has ever been formed or even considered by the trade itself, or any branch of it. It is further admitted that the employes and others referred to never enjoyed their wages or salaries upon the footing or idea that they were less in amount on account of embracing deferred pay. On examination, the extreme views were subjected to considerable modification. It was practically agreed that employes of less than ten years&apos; standing could not be reckoned into the account, and it may be said that the instances given of allowances on retirement, or of pensions for life, were instances very honourable in themselves of compassionate regard by considerate employers for the cases of infirm and aged employes who had been long in their service. It is not exactly within the scope of the remit, but the Committee does not think it is going too far when it suggests that after acquisition by the Government, if acquisition should take place, and upon the occasion of such displacement, if any, of employes of the kind referred to, namely, those who would have had compassionate allowances had the trade remained in private hands-such cases are fair matter for consideration upon the view that the Government should act on the principles which would have moved fair-minded employers.55. The point was put in this form to each class of witnesses, and some, with hesitation, but ulti-mately all, agreed that this was correct, although they naturally made the reservation that if there was a large and wholesale stoppage of the trade extra consideration might be had to the cases of allowances in view of the fact that openings for men dispossessed of employment would not be available in the same line of business. There may be some force in this, and the Committee does not think it right to report adversely upon it.56. Upon the general question, its opinion, however, is as just expressed. The idea that employes should be settled with on the footing of being paid out, as indeed was in at least one instance claimed,.
upon the ratio of the same number of years&apos; purchase of their salaries as was given for the businesses themselves (or indeed upon any principle of a number of years&apos; purchase) is one to which the Committee can give no approval or sanction.DIRECTORS.57. A word may be added as to the position of directors. The Committee fortunately embraces within its membership several gentlemen who have held this position in concerns of great importance throughout the country. It is unanimously of opinion that such a claim is unfounded. It may be at once said that it appeared but little in the evidence given; and one explanation was tendered, to this effect, that in at least not a few of the cases of the constitution of limited concerns the former pro-prietors were represented on the directorate, and would not themselves think of preferring a claim of the kind indicated. In practice when concerns are taken over, the directors, if not employed in the converted venture, are set free for employing their energies and business talents in other concerns. But the Committee does not wish to leave this topic without observing that the entire principle of such a claim seems to them to be very dangerous ground. A director is paid by honoraria awarded to him by the shareholders in general meeting. Anything which comes to a director by reason of, and as a part of, a transaction in which the business of his company is concerned, belongs to that company. He is bound to secure no private advantage at the expense of the concern which he manages. The Committee thinks that this same principle has a bearing upon the case in hand, and it thinks it would be of the worst example that in transactions of transfer of limited concerns the directors might have an interest of their own to be recognised by the other party to the transaction. It is open to the company itself when it is in liquidation, as hereinafter suggested, to make such resolutions as it deems fitting in recognition of services rendered to it in the course of negotiations. But the moment such recognition becomes part of the consideration for the bargain itself, the danger zone is entered. It would then be part of the transaction not only to buy out the company but to buy off the directors. A resultant conflict of interests is not difficult to figure. The Committee is not moved from these considerations by the suggestion that transactions with this dangerous element are not unheard of. The Committee has also pleasure in adding that, so far as the evidence given before it was concerned, no countenence was given to such a claim by directors.58. The position of Managing Director is a composite one, that is to say, he is at once servant and director. There does not appear to the Committee to be any ground for failing to apply to him in each capacity the principles severally applicable thereto as above set forth. The Committee concludes by observing, however, that if such principles were to be disregarded, the serious responsibility of that would rest upon the Government of the day, not as any part of the transaction of purchase, but as part of the scheme of policy or administration under which and on the occasions on which the business of those companies, or some of them, might be stopped.DISINTERESTED MANAGEMENT.59. The case of public-houses under disinterested management was brought before the Committee, especially from Glasgow and the West of Fife districts. According to the evidence before the Committee, all the public-houses so carried on are conducted with care, with a complete compliance with the law, and with very considerable profits. The Committee had the advantage of having before it Mr Stewart of Kelty, a small colliery town of large recent development, now numbering 8000 souls. In this village there are two public-houses under disinterested management. The capital employed is subscribed for by working men, and no investor is allowed to buy stock in excess of  200. About 300 persons in Kelty are interested in the venture. The management is also under the direction of working men, the total capital being over  10,000, and this yielding an annual profit of from 20 to 25 per cent. Five per cent, is the maximum limit of drawings by shareholders on then investment. The Kelty Public-House Society devotes the surplus of their income (after making good all depreciation, and setting aside a certain sum to reserve) to objects of public utility, including the providing of a district nurse, the pur-chase, building, and upkeep of a public hall, the laying out, etc., of a bowling-green, and other objects of more or less importance; and other public-house societies act upon the same lines with regard to all surplus profit over 5 per cent. The position taken up by these societies is that they and their directors are entitled, should purchase of the licensed business be made by the State, to be left in possession of the assets unconnected therewith, and to obtain from the State an equal amount in the shape of good-will as would have been allowed in the case of private owners. They assented to the view put before them by the Comnnttee, that this would involve the continuance of a trust in the district so as to take over the current obligations of the existing directors, and to carry on, so far as may be possible, for the benefit of the district, the public objects wdiich were in view in the initiation of the trust. The Com-mittee accepts the assurance of Mr Stewart, and the two other Fife representatives who appeared with him, that such committees could be formed of trustworthy men, and the good objects hitherto achieved might continue to be favoured under the newly constituted bodies.60. The Committee does not doubt that practical arrangements could be made of this character in all cases where a disinterested management had been the licensees, and they recommend accordingly. The Committee must be understood not to treat cases of disinterested management as in the category of allied trades or dependent interests. These societies are traders, and the Committee agrees that the claims put forward for equal treatment in the matter of purchase should be given to them along with the other public-house licensees.PUBLIC-HOUSES: GOODWILL.61. The Committee will deal first with that part of the inquiry which relates to direct supply; the trades of manufacture, rectifying and blending, will be dealt with later on. On the matter of direct supply, it is to the trade conducted in public-houses that the most general social interest attaches. These, as mentioned, are 5024 in number, and the license therefor is personal to the licensee, who, in
almost all or at least in the vast majority of cases, himself conducts his own business. He is answerable as an offender for any breach of the licensing laws or certificates. He is in some cases proprietor of the premises, in others a tenant for years, and in others a tenant at will.62. In almost all instances a value is created by the State in the grant of a license, sometimes a large value, and in all cases (exclusive of the relatively trifling charge made upon the certificate and license) this grant is a free grant, resulting wholly from an administrative act. It is also in express terms a grant of a license for a year and no longer. This is the strong and staple argument against compen-sation for suppression. No hindrance exists in Scotland to giving effect to this argument by reason of the rise or creation at the hand of the State of any vested interest for a longer period. The Corn-mittee has accordingly given care to the consideration of these points, and of the view that goodwill beyond the period of license is a negation of the terms of that license. The State should, it is argued, not be involved in claims for compensation for loss of business beyond the licensed period. The State is not bound either to recognise or to pay for such goodwill.63. On the other hand, goodwill exists. This fact is notorious : it constitutes a material item in transactions for the disposal of public-houses and their businesses. Properties are let and bought and sold on the footing that they have an added value by reason of the premises being licensed, and of the expectancy of their continuance as such. So far as the State is concerned, it is committed to this fact. Taxation as well as rating of properties has proceeded upon that basis.64. As to businesses themselves, the matter stands thus : In ordinary commercial transactions of purchase, goodwill is one of the principal items in the value of the thing transferred. Nor in trans-actions with the State is such value omitted. On the contrary, the actual goodwill is treated as consti-tuting part of a deceased publican&apos;s estate, and as such it is taxed for death-duties. This is in accordance with ordinary and regular practice, and the valuing of such goodwill is indeed part of the routine duty of tbe Government Valuer. The Inland Revenue and other authorities not unnaturally accept the commercial facts just as they stand, viz. that goodwill exists and has a value, and upon these facts base their legal demands arid receive payment of the duties. The value may vary with the effect of legislation from time to time : legislation affecting the trade may enhance it, as it appears to have done in England, or may lower it, as it appears to have done in Scotland : but when the problem of purchase is being considered, it is purchase of the present thing just as it is in fact not as it ought to be if certain elements of actual value were excluded.65. The Committee adopts the view just stated. It does so with the less hesitation for this reason. It does not think it reasonable to suggest that in a transaction between the trade and the State, the latter should be permitted to deny the existence and value of goodwill as a legitimate element of price when it has steadily affirmed the same as a legitimate subject of taxation. In individual cases, of course, the goodwill may not have had the time or the field for becoming more than nominal; in other cases it may, from a variety of circumstances, have been reduced to a vanishing point. But wherever this is not so, wherever, in short, the goodwill of a business is such that it would have entered the estate for taxation purposes, then in all such cases it is reasonable that it be paid for. ISlo arbitration could or would pro-ceed on any other basis : the State as purchaser ought not to ask other terms.ASCERTAINMENT OF PROFITS: GOODWILL: IMPORTANCE OF INLANDREVENUE RETURNS.66. If, however, this principle be applied to the State, it is only just that the same measure be meted out to the trade. This applies especially in two directions, namely, with regard to the number of years&apos; purchase of net profits which may be taken to represent the value of goodwill, and also the ascertainment of what the net profits are. Upon the first of these subjects there was much diversity of evidence, and -a remarkable circumstance on the second there was practically none. These two points will now be dealt with.   They are vital to values.67. Twenty&apos; years ago there occurred a great inflation of prices for public-house concerns. This was associated with certain speculative enterprise, on the part of wholesale houses, and after the collapse of some well-known firms in the wholesale liquor trade, prices began to fall. They have continued pretty steadily to fall ever since. In the opinion of the Committee the agitation in favour of restrictive legis-lation assisted this decline, and the Act of 1913 accelerated it. People engaged in or inclined to such business could not be blind to the added risks attaching to it. They were not, and prices sagged accordingly. Further, the action of the licensing magistracy in Scotland for at least a generation past has been markedly consistent and has, backed by popular approval, favoured reduction. In the great centres of population it may be true that a new license here and there has been granted in the suburban districts, but investigation has shown that the applicants thus successful have been the owners of public-houses in well-supplied districts, and have offered to relinquish those businesses and thereupon have got a new license elsewhere. In a sense such suburban licenses were new, but as city licenses they were renewals with a change of location. Apart from this, the broad fact&apos;is that not only have the relative numbers of houses steadily declined, but that, for more than twenty years past the grant of a really new license is a-very rare event. The course of legislation, and the changes in regard&quot;to Courts and their procedure, have been referred to, and it seems plain that public sentiment has at least fully supported the policy described.PUBLIC-HOUSES: STATISTICS.68. In illustration of what has been said, the following figures may be given showing the number of public-houses and the relation which that number bears to the population : In Scotland as a whole, the number of public-houses has greatly fallen, the figures being :-In 1894............  5571 houses.&quot; 1904..-     -     -     -.......      .     .    &apos; .   55441914 .............5130

And a more helpful view takes account of the relation which the numbers bear to the population.In 1894 it was    .     .     .     ...     .     .     .     .     . 4,165,606In 1904 it was........... 4,563,985And in 1914 it was                        .     .     .     .     .     .     . 4,747,167The relation of number of licensed public-houses to population is accordingly : In 1894, 1 public-house to every 748 of population. ,, 1904, 1 ,,      ,,    ,,   8231914, 1 ,,      ,,    ,,   92569.

This has been particularly so in the case of Glasgow. The increase of population, accordingly, is not a mere natural growth, but a parliamentary growth. The important comparison, therefore, is in the ratios that is, in the number of houses relative to the actual population at the respective dates.70. The effect of the figures so viewed cannot be gainsaid. The numbers of public-houses in relation to the population served have, under the law in its various stages during the past twenty years, under-gone a reduction remarkably steady, although, it may be, remarkably slow. This fact bearing upon the general chance in the life of a license reflects itself no doubt in values. But there has to be added also the undoubtedly increasing rigour of supervision and control, and the greater restrictions under the law in recent years, with the risks attached to contraventions, and also the changing habits of the people.PUBLIC-HOUSES: EFFECT OF ACT OF 1913 ON VALUES.71. The view expressed on behalf of the trade was that the statute of 1913 can be ignored, as having no bearing upon the value of licensed businesses. The Committee cannot agree with this view. It thinks the number of years&apos; profit, taken to represent that value, is distinctly lower since that Act was seen to be a likely measure, and was passed. It would be curious if it were not so. But, fortunately, the evidence given before the Committee puts the point beyond reasonable doubt.72. Instances were cited of the worthlessness of some concerns, and of the eagerness to find a buyer for the mere price of the stock and fittings ; but such instances may be discarded. The general result appearing from series of transactions was that values were distinctly lower since- the Act. The experienced valuers for the Board of Control were of this opinion, and this view was without exception that of magistrates, heads of police, and others officially acquainted with the subject. Among these we mention, for instance, Sir John Lindsay, the Town Clerk of Glasgow, whose long and very intimate connection with the subject is unrivalled. One of our number, Sir Thomas Munro, put the question thus: &quot; Take public-house values the goodwill was reckoned at so many years&apos; purchase. Assume that prior to the passing of the Temperance Act it was five or six years&apos; purchase. We are now in 1917, with 1920 approaching. What do you think the five years or the six years will be reduced to now or in 1920 ? To this Sir John replies : &quot; I do not know that I could give you a definite figure, but I should certainly say at least half of that, and perhaps less.&quot; That he is not speaking from mere conjecture appears from a later portion of his evidence, in which he says : &quot;I should have added that in the Licensing Court when applications are made for transfers on the basis of purchase, the Court asks in each case what money is passing for the goodwill of the shop, and it is stated either publicly or privately by a note being handed
to the bench. We knowfrom the figures put before us in those cases that there is, and has been for some ,time, a decrease in the prices paid.   I think it is notorious.&quot;FACTS BEARING ON FUTURE OF TRADE AND ON VALUES. (1) Attitude of Authorities on Prohibition. 73. It may be well, however, to mention to the Government one or two facts bearing on the proba-: bilities attaching to this question which have come to the knowledge of the Committee in the course of the inquiry, and which to-some extent may bear upon the future of the trade and the question of values. The attitude of the public authorities on the question of out-and-out prohibition during the war and the period of demobilisation is remarkable.   As mentioned, official evidence was given before the Committee from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, and Aberdeen-these cities embracing a population of 1,797,600, that is to say, about one-third of the population of Scotland.   In every one of these a resolution had been passed by the Town Councils in favour of such total prohibition.   Similar resolutions were, the Com-mittees understands, passed by other thirty-four Town Councils and by four County Councils.(2) Women&apos;s Vote.74. As bearing upon this last point of the probabilities of the case, the recent experience of Dundee during a period when war allowances to women were regularly paid may be mentioned. In the year 1916 the male arrests for drunkenness were 940, and the female arrests were no less than 790. The Com-mittee inclines to the opinion that striking facts of this character would tend to consolidate the women&apos;s vote in favour of prohibition.(3) Conclusions as to Public Opinion.75. The facts just set forth, although in themselves noteworthy, would not if taken singly justify any general conclusion. Taken together, however, and viewed in the light of the past history already cited, they have an undoubted cumulative bearing on the problem put before the Committee. It has been stated to the Committee by public authorities and others, that the public opinion of the people of Scotland on the drink question in the direction of limitation, restriction, and prohibition has been steadily and considerably in advance of Government action. The Committee entirely agrees with the views put before it by magistrates and officials that the reduction of licenses would, apart from the local option under the Act of 1913, have been progressive, but that, further, the rate of reduction will receive considerable impetus by that statute.VALUES :  DATUM PERIOD.76. It is from this point of view that the question of values for purchase should, in the Committee&apos;s opinion, be viewed. Practically, the datum point should be the beginning of 1914, when the Temperance (Scotland) Act was on the statute-book, and when normal conditions were not disturbed by the war. A period of three years&apos; trade prior to that date that is to say, the average annual profits of trade for the years 1911, 1912, and 1913 would appear to give the datum required.PROFITS OF PUBLIC-HOUSES:  RETURNS TO INLAND REVENUE.77. What were these profits &apos;( Upon this point much evidence was led. Put generally. the business result seemed to be that of every hundred pounds of gross drawings,  40 might be reckoned as gross profits, and from  16 to  20 as net profits. Another estimate proceeded by simply reckoning the value of the business to be in a rough and read)&apos; fashion fixed by the amount of the gross annual overturn on spirits. These estimates are not condemned ; on the contrary, as estimates, they appear to be the best available.   But there is, it is evident, room for great looseness in results so arrived at.78. It appeared to the Committee that the trade, in the persons of the individual publicans, had already had dealings with the Government on this very question of the amount of annual profits. Just as, in the opinion of the Committee already expressed, the Government could not in fairness reckon as non-existent for the purposes of purchase what it reckoned as existent for the purpose of death-duty, so a similar principle should be applied to the traders, and the latter should not be permitted to claim to have earned a higher or different profit than that which they had returned to the Inland Revenue Authorities as in accordance with fact and upon which they had paid or escaped from taxation.79. Profits are the subject of annual returns, not only by the individual payer of income tax, but also by those engaged in trade who claim to be excused from paying the tax, or to have any statutory deductions made from the amount stated as income. Falsehood therein may have penal consequences. Accordingly, it is such returns not the income-tax assessments or receipts,-but such returns, that if available and all gathered together, would yield the results sought for, namely, the aggregate annual profits of the publican business in &quot;Scotland.The value of such returns being undoubted, a point of much interest arose, namely, that in Scotland as it turned out, the Inland Revenue is able to afford a larger mass of information upon the subject than in England. The point is thus stated in the important evidence given by Mr Stamp, assistant secretary to the Board of Inland Revenue, and the passage is quoted as a whole.&quot; So far as retailersare concerned, is the use of income-tax returns as hopeless in England as in Scotland ? In England it would be extremely difficult to use it to any degree of accuracy. In Scotland it is much more possible.&quot; Why is that ? In the first place, accounts are kept by the publican upon which he bases his returns in a much larger number of cases. Although we may not have the accounts, yet it would be possible if such a scheme were put forward for accounts to be called for, and they would be forthcoming to a
greater extent in Scotland than in England. In Scotland the publican is better educated in these matters and takes more pains. The number of persons in England who are not called upon for returns at all because they are exempt is a very large number. In Scotland it is not so large. So the area over which there is no information at all is smaller in Scotland relatively. Then again, in England one of the things that makes if extraordinarily difficult to get at a really exact profit, even-where you have got the accounts, is the fact that the publican and his wife and family live on the premises, and then household personal expenses are more or less mixed up with the business expenses. One has to analyse it by a rough and ready means two-thirds for the business and one-third for the house, say. Whereas in Scotland almost entirely licensed houses are locked-up premises and the licensee lives somewhere else, so that all the expense he incurs at the licensed house really belongs to the business, and it is not therefore necessary to make this adjustment. So the accounts do not require the same kind of adjustment in Scotland as they requiie in England.&quot;80. A further important point in connection with these returns is to secure that if possible businesses shall be treated as such and placed upon a common ground of equality in so far as charges against them are concerned.   This applies in three directions : (1) Where a licensee is or is not his own landlord, the equality is seemed by placing against the gross profit rent in all cases, the figure in the landlord-occupant case being derived from Schedule A.(2) Some businesses are conducted without and some largely with borrowed money. Interest upon borrowed money enters the account as an item to be deducted from profit. This item is personal to the particular licensee and does not attach to the profits of the business as such. Equality is produced by analysing the return made and eliminating this element of interest on borrowed capital.(3) In some cases licensees manage and in others do not manage the business. This disturbing element is rectified by an average allowance covering all cases in respect of management by licensees. This allowance, the Committee suggests, may be fairly estimated on an average as one-quarter of the profits. The Committee has thus, with the assistance of most highly skilled officials, done its best to procure a soundly based common denominator which may and, according to Mr Stamp, who speaks as a highly trained statistician, will result in a substantially trustworthy estimate being formed.81. A difficulty was mentioned which promised to be serious. As already stated, the Government has not appeared as a party to the inquiry qua prospective purchaser. If it had, the question would have been put whether it had availed itself of the information in its own archives which was relevant and perhaps vital to the issue of the value of the subject it proposed to buy. The Committee took up the position that it should be as fully supplied with the facts relevant to a true financial result as the Government itself is. The difficulty referred to was this. Such information, the view was, is confidential : it is the practice of the department so to treat it: this is the rule of the service. In the opinion of the Committee this rule of confidentiality as to which in general there may be much difference of opinion  is altogether misapplied in the instance in hand. If a trader sells to the Government and the Government buys from a trader, there is no breach of confidentiality in either or both founding upon documents which have actually passed between themselves and been the basis in the past of their financial relations. The Committee attaches no importance to the suggestion that these returns are the property of the Local Assessors or Authorities. They become possessed of them as instruments of the central taxing authority, and must use them as directed.  Any difficulty on this head would probably be quickly obviated.82. These views seem conclusive enough as regards the individual trader, and will no doubt be acted upon when the values of the particular businesses come to be fixed. But the objections indicated have even less substance when applied to the aggregate of the trade. The Committee, however, does not waste time over the point, or on the further suggestion that the trade would stand out against the disclosure as a breach of &quot;Government duty. For it is only just to the trade to state that it has adopted no such position. On the contrary, leading and representative members of various branches of the liquor trade have all concurred in the view that the basis of actual returns is a sure basis ; that persons or firms making such returns should be held bound by them, and that all estimates would and ought to be dispensed with if the sum of the actual returns can be obtained.83. The traders thus consenting, the Committee was further indebted to Mr Stamp for securing and placing in its possession the results of his labours on the large mass of material which he and his staff had to sift and tabulate. In some instances relatively few and applicable to very small businesses no returns were put in; and estimates have been made in such cases so as to have the figures on a national scale complete.84. The results arrived at, that is to say. the annual net profits of the entire public-house trade in Scotland, made up in terms of this Report, were: For the year 1911...... 1,131,3821912......1,212,860,..   1913      .....,      1,294,328In all    .        .        .        .     3,638,570The average net profit struck over those three pre-war years thus stands at the sum of  1,212,856 per annum.85. The next, and very important, question for the Committee was : What multiplier of this figure should be taken ? In other words, what number of years&apos; purchase of net profits represents the good-will of the public-houses in Scotland.86. As was to be expected, there was upon this subject great divergence of testimony. The trade went so far as to claim an overhead rate of ten years&apos; purchase. This figure, or anything approaching it, is in the opinion of the Committee-entirely out of accord with the great weight of the evidence. The Committee takes the crucial date to be the beginning of 1914, after a long and steady process of reduction of licensed houses, and with an Act passed under whose operation the reduction on an accelerated scale is not improbable ; it has considered the valuation for death-duty purposes, and the whole mass of facts
as to transactions placed before it. In its opinion tbe: average general value of tbe goodwill ,of public-bouse businesses in Scotland is three and a half years&apos; purchase of the annual net profits.87. This multiplier being applied to the number of licenses now existing, the resultant figure for goodwill is approximately  3,938,500.TRADERS&apos; FURTHER CLAIMS: CONTRACTS, UTENSILS, STOCKS.88. Traders have three further claims, all of which appear to be well founded. They are, in the opinion of the Committee, (1) entitled to be relieved of current business contracts, including contracts of lease of the licensed premises; (2) they must be paid for the value of moveable fittings, tenants&apos; fixtures, and utensils ; and (3) have their stocks taken over and paid for by the Government as purchasers.89. One method of reckoning the value of the businesses was to take such an overhead multiplier of profits as would include these items. The Committee sees the attractiveness of a rough and ready method of this kind, and certain advantages in thus avoiding the trouble of valuations. But the differences in fittings and stocks are so great that the chances are that an overhead average would rarely square with true values, and would, in the large majority of cases, be unjust either on one side or the other. The Committee rejects this idea, It would be no consolation to the trader who on the overhead system had received less than his due to know that his neighbour had on the same system received more. Tbe correct and just method of individual valuations should be adopted, failing an agreed on figure, which no doubt would in the large majority of cases be reached with the licensee. From the best data available it is, in the view of the Committee, unlikely that the [gross value of these two items would exceed  1,405,000. Of this sum,  683,000 represent stocks at present values, and in regard to this item the principle of the application of the Excess Profits Duty, or its alternative, will no doubt be the same as that adopted in reference to distillers&apos; and blenders&apos; stocks, as afterwards particularly dealt with.PURCHASE, MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PRICES.90. The distribution among the respective traders of the gross sum stated for goodwill should proceed also upon the principle of individual valuations. But the Committee, in view of the extravagant claims put forward by this branch of the trade, is satisfied that justice would be fully met by striking two years&apos; purchase and four years&apos; purchase as the minimum and maximum figures of such valuations. If a trader demanded two years&apos; purchase this should be conceded at once. If more, then the case.would be one for valuation, subject to the maximum of four years. The range of difference being thus reduced, agree-ment would be more likely.VALUATION PROCEDURE: VALUERS, OFFICIAL ARBITERS.91. The suggested procedure may be roughly sketched. The Government, acting through the Purchase and Management Board after-mentioned, should be obliged to make in each case an offer  within the limits stated, and the trader should be entitled to have exhibited to him free of charge all the statistical materials used by the valuers so as to enable him to judge of the adequacy of the offer. This being done, the negotiations or inquiry could proceed. Up to this stage each party&apos;s expenses would be a charge upon himself.92. It will be seen that this contemplates, if the scheme of purchase be proceeded with, the employ-ment of skilled valuers by the Board. But the Committee further recommends in that event the nomina-tion of official arbiters sufficient in number to permit of the entire work being concluded within a period of one year. From the list of official arbiters the.parties would choose one. If the)&apos;- were agreed, and he were available, the arbitration before him would proceed. If he were not available, and they could not agree upon another, then the sheriff of the county would select from the list the arbitrator to be employed. If there was a desire to save setting up fresh machinery, then the War Losses Commission^ powers might be extended to include the arbitral work here set out.93. After this stage, costs that is to say, the costs of the inquiry where agreement was not reached -would follow the event. If the offer proved inadequate, the trader would be entitled to his costs as an addition to the award : if the offer proved adequate, he would be charged with Iris opponents costs as a deduction therefrom. There would be no allowance for compulsory taking. The valuer, and failing agreement, the arbiter, could also be invoked to settle the rent payable by the State, after current leases expired or where there were no such leases.ARBITRATION COSTS : COMPULSORY TAKING.94. The Committee is clear and emphatic upon these two points. Speaking with some experience in such matters, it is of opinion that both of these items, namely, arbitration costs, and the allowances for compulsory taking, have proved in the past great and in principle-unwarrantable hindrances to public undertakings, and ultimately also additions to the burdens of the people. It is also evident that a temptation, sometimes yielded to, is offered by the practice under the Lands Clauses Acts as to costs, for screwing up prices by the leverage which the threat of a contested inquiry provides. As to com-pulsory taking, legislation for many years past has varied the Lands Clauses provisions, and the view that when private interest has to yield to public needs, all it can justly claim is that it be paid out at its full value has gained ground. An instructive instance of the legislation referred to is the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Lands) Act, 1916, 6 and 7 Geo. V., cap. 63.95. When the Purchase Board is formed, it, with the assistance of the arbiters, will no doubt regulate procedure and fix the scale of costs ; but the Committee has thought it right to point out to the Govern-ment that unless the two points just mentioned be provided for, the equity of the terms of any trans-action of purchase by the State will be greatly impaired.
- 90. In the Committees opinion, as will have been observed, it is no part of its task to proceed to assess actual individual values. It considers, however, its duty to be to furnish to the best of its ability a statement of values en masse and on a national scale, and of the general lines, cost, and terms of the projected transaction.PURCHASE AND MANAGEMENT BOARD.97. Details and individual values will, the Committee presumes, be entrusted for working out to a permanent Board, to be called possibly the Purchase Board or Purchase and Management Board. One expedient might be to take the existing Liquor Control Board in so far as the same is applicable, to Scotland and adapt it to the fuller purposes designed. But whether this be so or not, the Committee recommends, if purchase is to be proceeded with, that such a Purchase and Management Board be set up; that, as it will be the inheritors of the experience of the Liquor Control Board, it should be invested  subject to the exceptions about to be mentioned-with all their existing powers, and divested of the limitations arising from that Board bemg a war expedient; that further powers be granted to enable it to divide its forces or adopt suitable measures for overtaking the task set before it, but that (and this is the exception) it should be boimd in its management to conform to the results reached under statutory local option, as well as to the magisterial sanction required for the grant of licenses. While it is not for the Committee to go further ^ and in this Report to shape the full details of a scheme, should the policy of purchase be entered upon, it has appeared to it expedient to state the general conditions, without which, in its opinion, the measure would fail to fit the case of Scotland.AFTER PURCHASE: POSITION OF LICENSEE.98. The sum of the figures already given is  5,343,500. This sum is an inclusive sum, that is to say, the figure is set down in order to let the Government understand for how much goodwill, stocks, and moveable fittings of public-houses in Scotland could be purchased, doing full justice to all interests therein.99. The position of the licensee thus dispossessed would be this : he would be in the possession of the sum paid to him by the Government. He would be relieved of all current contracts in connection with the trade. None of his other assets or liabilities would be interfered with. The arrangement of these would be his own affair, and he would be free to enter into the service of the Government if ihe latter resolved to continue the business, or employ him in any other capacity, or himself to dispose of his labours otherwise. While the seller would thus be free, it is, in the opinion of the Committee, desirable and important that the buyer, the Government, be also free, and that no arrangement, whether for service or otherwise, should form part of the transaction of purchase. Unless such entanglements be avoided there is a possibility of public loss, injury, and dissatisfaction.AFTER PURCHASE: POSITION OF LANDLORD.100. The position of the landlord of the premises in which the business is conducted would, in the opinion of the Committee, stand thus. When he was owner of the license that is to say, carrying on a licensed trade in a house belonging to himself- no question would arise. He would be paid the sum settled for goodwill, etc., and would be bound to continue to let his premises to the Government as his tenant of the public-house, for the goodwill of which it had paid. In the case where the premises were let upon a lease contracted in bonafide before the date of the issue of this Report, the landlord should, in the opinion of the Committee, be entitled to hold, the Government to this bargain, and failing this, the latter should be entitled to compensation. The two cases figured are these. First, the Government would continue the business under the lease and pay the stipulated rent. Second, if the Government, however, discontinued the business, the occupancy of the premises would revert to the landlord and the Government would be liable to pay the capitalised sum of the stipulated rent for the unexpired period of the lease, or of the difference between that rent and the rents to be obtained for other purposes by the landlord in the ordinary property market. Where there is no lease the Government so long as it carries on the business will continue as tenants at the old rent, or at such rent as failing agreement may be fixed by the valuer or arbiter. It is evident, however, that such payments are conditional upon the policy to be adopted, after the event of purchase, by the Parliament and Government of the day. Should the business be/ carried on no sums will be due. In short, such payments form no part of the purchase price, but are dependent upon subsequent developments and administration in the hands of the Purchase and Management Board before mentioned. Such sums or any other allowances made (it might be, for instance, for reconstruction so as to convert the premises from licensed to an unlicensed trade) on the occasion of the stoppage of the licensed trade depend, as just explained, upon adminis-trative policy, and do not enter the Purchase Account. In that account the sums affecting the business purchase are the items of goodwill, stocks and moveable fittings.*GROCERS&apos; LICENSED TRADE.101. The considerations and principles above set forth as applicable to public-house businesses will largely also apply to the case of the grocers&apos; licensed trade.   They are accordingly not repeated.102. It may be mentioned, however, that the steady decrease in, the numbers of these grocers&apos; licenses for many years past is quite as noticeable, and the rate of decrease is greater. Further, the evidence shows that the effects of the trade restrictions, not only under regulations made on account of the war, but by the legislation of recent years, are more powerful, and in many cases so powerful as to cause at least the licensed portions and the-licenses to lapse. Sometimes the whole business is given up.  Such licenses would never, in the opinion of the Committee, be renewed.
105. In the four cities visited by the Committee the figures stand thus : 	1884.	1894.	1904.	1914.Edinburgh :				Population...... Grocers&apos; licenses..... Ratio, 1 in   .     .     .	242,802 460 528	272,683 380 717	331,977 421 788	321,900 347 927Glasgow :				Population...... Grocers&apos; licenses   .      .      .

The effect of those figures is even more striking than in the case of the estimates in the numbers .ic-houses taken both absolutely and in relation to the population served.GROCERS&apos; LICENSES: PURCHASE ACCOMPANIED BY ^EXTINCTION.103. Under legislation, for instance, the later opening that is to say, not until ten a.ni. may be mentioned, and under the Regulations made by the Liquor Control Board the abolition of credit may be specially noted. This Regulation has been very effective in stopping a system which has been hitherto difficult to eradicate. The glaring defects, to use no stronger an expression, of that system have, been long familiar to Scotland. The defects referred to affected the general system of supplying drink to customers in Scotland and were manifest in the national life long before the institution of grocers&apos; licenses ; but under these licenses the defects developed in insidious and highly detrimental dnections. The Tippling Act was passed so long ago as 1751, namely, the 24th of George II., Chapter 40, under which no one could sue successfully for the price of any spirituous liquor supplied &quot; unless the debt was bonajkh contracted to the amount of 20s. at one time.&quot; The Act was often evaded ; drink was entered under many devices in the merchants book. Officers of the law were deceived. In many cases the workmen were deceived by the pass-books kept with the merchants by their wives, and con-taining fictitious entries suggesting that goods had been purchased instead of liquor. These fictitious entries were meant, of course, also to deceive a Court in case of inquiry. Credit continued very common, and scandals were frequent. As showing how deeply rooted the credit system still is, the Committee was informed of one instance in Dundee of a recent prosecution of one grocer who had ignored the regulation against credit, and who was charged with no fewer than 300 contraventions. The Connnittee is of opinion that it may be taken to be in the highest degree unlikely that even after the war, and although no step of purchase be taken, will credit be allowed again to be introduced by the normal small trader. It has thought it right to accept this as one of the probabilities of the case and entering in that manner into the question of values.GROCERS&apos; LICENSES:  FIGURES.104. The number of grocers&apos; licenses in Scotland was in the beginning of 1914 (the datum period already referred to) 3467. The figures which follow are given on the same lines as those already stated in reference to public-houses.   The number of grocers&apos; licenses was : 1894       .        .        ...     38301904      .....     3950-   1914       .        . .        .      3467The fall in numbers in these twenty years is accordingly 363, but this, to use the language already employed, imperfectly discloses the subject, and a more helpful view takes account of the relation which the numbers bear to the population.   As already stated : 1894 the population was 4,165.606 1904      ,, 4,563,9851914       ,, ,,       4,747,167The relation of the number of grocers&apos; licenses to population is accordingly : 1894, 1 to every 1087 of population. 1904, 1 to every 1155 1914, 1 to every 1369
GROCERS&apos; LICENSED TRADE:  VALUES,107. To the general considerations and principles which are already mentioned there must, how-ever, be added as applicable to the case of grocers&apos; licenses two noticeable facts arising from within the liquor trade itself. A representative appointed to give evidence by the trade in Leith stated his opinion to the effect that there was very little value, in the goodwill of grocers&apos; businesses. As showing the violent variation of opinion, however, upon this subject, it may be added that Mr Marshall, who ably repre-sented the licensed retail traders of Scotland as a witness before the Committee, stated the value of the goodwill of licensed grocers&apos; liquor interest to be ten years&apos; purchase of net profits. The Committee, however, views both of these classes of evidence as extreme. After full consideration the Committee is of opinion that the goodwill of the liquor trade done by grocers maybe justly put at two years&apos; purchase of the net profits of their licensed trade.108. These net profits it is almost impossible to disentangle from the profits of the business as a whole, and, on this account, the Committee has felt itself compelled to include this item within the general head of miscellaneous and incidental payments.GROCERS&apos; FURTHER CLAIMS.109. Grocers would further, as in the public-house case, be entitled to be relieved of current contracts, including obligations under contract of lease, and would be entitled to be paid for moyeable fittings and tenants&apos; fixtures used exclusively in the liquor trade and existing stocks. For the individual cases a minimum of one year and a maximum of three years&apos; purchase would apply. Within these limits the same principles of arrangement, inquiry, and arbitration as has been already stated would also come into operation. It is possible that the abolition of licenses would induce in some cases the cessation of trade as a grocer. The Committee quite understands how in the past the possession of the license has enabled general business to&apos; be attracted, customers desiring the convenience of buying the whole of their stores from one shop. This loss of custom will not now occur on that head, however, owing to this cause : the unlicensed shop will have no licensed rival. The multiplier of two years&apos; net profits of the trade in liquor has been fixed to cover all contingencies of disturbance to the general trade ; other-wise, a lower-multiplier would have been stated. In the case of licensed grocers&apos; businesses the value of stock and fittings may be taken to be  99,000. Of this sum  38,000 represents stock, and this item will be dealt with on the same footing as in the public-house case.GROCERS&apos; TRADE:  LANDLORDS.110. When the question of the interest of the landlord emerges, however, the difference between the two cases of public-houses and grocers&apos; licenses must be faced. That difference is this. In the case of public-houses it is possible that the business may be continued at least in many cases and at least for a number of years, so that it is impossible to state beforehand how many and what particular licenses of this class would be abandoned. Such abandonment will be part of the subsequent policy of manage-ment of the trade as a whole.111. But the grocers&apos; licensed trade appears to the Committee to be differently situated. In its opinion it is clear that the nation would not carry on such a trade. The idea that the State would become owner of the whole business of the grocer that is to say, take over the sale of groceries as well as drink, and thereby put itself into competition with all the grocery trade of the country cannot be entertained. And further, the idea that the State as owner of a licensed portion of the business would join with the grocer as the owner of the rest of it, and that the business should be conducted on that footing, is equally out of the question. In short, the Committee does not hesitate to say that it must be con-sidered to be part and parcel of a transaction of purchase of grocers&apos; licenses that they are all suppressed. The State may choose other directions for conducting off sale. It might have to make inroads into the ordinary Licensing Laws in order to enable it to do so, but these things are questions of policy with which the Committee as such has no concern.112. The consequent position of the landlord of grocers&apos; licensed premises has to be considered. A part of the trade for which they were let is gone. It may be mentioned that the statute of 1913 in dealing with leases of all licensed premises whose certificate was not renewed by reason of the exercise of the powers of local option, simply declared that the leases of the premises should cease and determine. The Committee might have some unwillingness to suppression effected, not under, but separate from, and in anticipation of, the statute as regulated by the principle of its provisions.113. But the problem turns out not to be serious, and indeed, according to the evidence given, does not arise upon the facts. It is necessary to explain that the commercial change effected in the value of public-houses and of grocers&apos; premises by the delicensing thereof is greatly different. In the former case many instances occur of licenses in back or side streets where there is little commercial business, and where accordingly the values may be seriously lowered, and reconstruction possibly into dwelling-houses only would be costly. In the latter the case of grocers&apos; premises the situation is nearly always a business situation, the values of the premises are business values.114. And the point is that after the loss of the license the premises, according to the evidence men-tioned, do retain as lettable property their former value. This is vouched for by the best available evidence in Scotland, namely, that of Mr Blair and his entire staff of forty valuers throughout the fourteen districts into which the country is divided. Mr Blair&apos;s particular and prolonged attention was directed to the problem, and the result is as stated. The Committee, however, notwithstanding this evidence, still has the feeling that there may be individual cases where a real loss of rent may occur, and it is unwilling to rule such cases out of compensation. It accordingly -recommends that where a case is put forward as exceptional, it should be open to the valuer or arbiter to make an award, up to the sum of one half year&apos;s rent of the premises, or of such portions thereof, in the case of large businesses with separate
departments, as in the valuer&apos;s opinion would be treated as allocated to the licensed liquor trade. No separate entry is made of this hypothetical item : it will be covered by the amount hereafter stated for incidentals.HOTELS.115. In approaching the case of hotels, the Committee desire to explain that the dimensions of the subject from the point of view of social importance and convenience are not so great as is generally supposed. A very large number of these inn and hotel licenses, the number of which is in Scotland 1533, are granted to houses all over the country which do little else than a public-house trade. The true meaning of the separate license is that it is generally a seven-day license, and business can be conducted with residenters, or with bona fide travellers, on Sundays. As for the general accommodation of the public, on the other hand, it has appeared to be quite clear that licensed hotels do not form a great element in satisfying any real demand for liquor on the part of the people. One illustration may be given. The population of Glasgow, by the latest available statistics, is about 1 j millions. To supply the hotel needs of this large body of people, about one-fourth of the population of Scotland, together with the great travelling public who resort to that city, it might have been thought that licensed hotels possibly to the number of hundreds would have been required. In point of fact the number is only fifteen, by far the most important of which are the great station hotels.116. It thus appears to the Committee that this is a case in which, if purchase be carried through, very considerable readjustments would follow even although the trade in drink was carried on. Many of these licenses would disappear as such. Some would be merged in the public-house list, and others would be deprived of licenses and be conducted, in many cases as very profitable concerns, as temperance hotels, the number of which in Scotland is relatively large.117. The Committee cannot leave this subject without pointing out to the Government the com-plexity of the operation of entering upon possession of, businesses which are in the most valuable cases businesses connected with the accommodation of travellers and the carrying on of a trade not necessarily a licensed trade. The figures have been brought together by the Committee because in its opinion without furnishing these it would have failed to exhaust the remit made to it. But the Committee repeats that there are various questions for consideration, notably the shutting up of restaurants in hotels, the confinement of hotel business to liquor supplied to visitors accommodated thereat, and topics of that nature, to which subjects the Government would have to address itself if it faced a transaction of purchase of this particular class of trade. The Committee is not to be held as expressing any opinion upon these subjects. Indeed the Committee may at this stage state to the Government quite clearly that, while the figures which are hereafter summed up in this Report embrace the various items of the licensed trade in Scotland, it in no way follows that the action of the Government should extend to all or any of these items. The question of purchase of the whole or of any part is entirety a question for the Government of the day, and upon that the Committee, as already indicated, has scrupulously-avoided expressing any opinion.118. As stated, the number of houses certificated as inns and hotels in Scotland is 1533. So far as the hotel-keepers&apos; business is concerned, the net annual profits of their entire trade is  479,918. In this case a certain portion of that trade would be unfettered by licensing restrictions. Accordingly, if the business has, to the extent of 50 per cent., its drawings from its licensed trade, the Committee is of opinion that the same multiple of years should be taken as in the case of public-houses. The number of such cases is stated at. say, 1200-which is purely an estimate. The average profits proportionate to that number, upon the principle adopted in this Reports-Paragraph 80 is  265,118. In the case of the instances where the business done is really a public-house one, the figures and procedure applicable to public-houses would accordingly be adopted. In other important cases, numbering, on the same provisional estimate, 333, the purchase would be limited to the licensed part of the trade, the net profit from which is estimated at  47,410 per annum. While the average of three and a half years&apos; purchase of the profits thereof would apply, the Committee, in view of the possible dislocation of the remaining trade, suggest that the minimum value for this class of hotels should stand at two and a half years&apos; purchase of net profit, and the maximum at five years. So far as the purchase of the businesses is concerned, the trans-action could be worked out upon these lines. The two sums amount to  312,528 of annual profit. This, multiplied by 3J, reaches the capital figure of  1,093,848, which is brought out as the purchase price. The sums for fittings and stocks under this head amount together to  227,070.HOTELS: LANDLORDS&apos; POSITION: CLUBS.119. With regard to the property in which hotel businesses are carried on, the case is different from that of properties licensed as grocers&apos; premises. In the latter case suppression of the licensed trade is contemporaneous with and a practical necessity of the transaction, and the heritable property would thus be left with the owner, full compensation being made to him for the difference in value by the permanent disappearance of that trade. In the f ormer, the hotel case, such suppression is not a. necessarv consequence of purchase and would depend on the general policv to be adopted by Parliament, or the particular policy adopted by the Purchase and Management Board. For this reason, accordingly, all the calculations as to landlords&apos; interests in current leases which are stopped are inapplicable : they might not be stopped; the State might continue the tenancy, and allowances made on such heads do not arise. , The State must for itself face the situation of the composite trade of hotelkeeper being carried on for such a period, long or short, as it may determine. As in the case of public-houses, the stoppage of the carrying on of the liquor business in the premises is no necessary term of the sale and transfer of the license, and so does not enter the present purchase transaction :&apos; when the fate of the premises-is afterwards determined, it will be on such terms as will be afterwards settled. In the case of grocers&apos; licenses, that business ends, and the owner of the premises is entitled to be settled with now and the depreciation, if any, of his property at once paid.   In the case of hotels the business may be stopped
or continued according to the general or particular policy adopted after the business is required, but if continued two cases would arise : (1) Many, possibly two-thirds, might be declassed into public-houses and the business continued in that character. Settlement of landlords compensation &quot;for such declassing, if the value has truly been reduced, would take place when that event occurred. (2) The others would be continued as hotels, and if so, the Committee, as already indicated; thinks that the State must face the problems that arise in that connection. Until stoppage no landlord-loss or depreciation would arise. When it did arise it might be many years after purchase the occasion would then have arisen for settlement of a figure and for payment, or tor as might frequently be the case an arrangement for conversion and transfer of the business, or the introduction of other commercial elements.120. The Committee cannot keep out of view on this head the particular case of Railway Station Hotels. Immediate acquisition of all hotel premises in the country has occurred to many as a solution of the difficulties the idea being to produce a settlement with the owners as well as licensees, and a closing of the entire transaction once for all. There is not a little to be said for this view; but it is clear that such a solution would be a work of the greatest complexity, colliding, it might be, violentlv with other public or railway arrangements. Such cases are, in the Committee&apos;s opinion, more suited to subsequent individual and careful negotiation than to a broad and sudden dispropriation of railway companies of valuable land and property lying near the centres of their enterprise, It might be held that if the State *is to purchase the liquor trade, it must in the case of hotels purchase the whole trade done therein; that it must, so long as the trade is continued, be so continued by the State as tenants; and that when and not until discontinuance occurs will questions of landlords&apos; compensation arise. Such questions are no part of the purchase transaction with which the Committee has to deal.121. The question as to the amount of rent to be paid by the State would be settled, failing agreement, by the official arbitrator in all those cases where the owner or railway had carried on the business, or where current contracts came to an end. This principle the Committee further recommends as applicable not only to hotels but, as has been stated, to public-houses. In the hotel case the allowance for declassing would be similarly disposed of.122. The position of Clubs is that, although in fact the)&apos; purchase liquor for consumption by their members, they are not engaged in trade. It is illegal for anyone concerned in the management of Clubs to make any private profit from such dealings. Clubs, in short, are simply private buj^ers, so far as the liquor trade is concerned, in the same way as other citizens or bodies of citizens. They might, of course, as the result of State action in certain directions, be affected in their conveniences or possibilities of buying, and it may be found necessary to make regulations as to the hours of drinking so as to put an effective stop to a defeat of general regulations upon that head. But no question of purchase, such as is the subject of the present remit, arises for determination by the Committee.WINE MERCHANTS.123. There were certain other minor items to which brief allusion was made in the evidence before the Committee. They would not in the Committee&apos;s opinion seriously affect the total amount of purchase money. Chief among these is the case of the wine merchants, and the Committee recommends that this class be dealt with on the same footing and scale as that of hotel-keepers. It may be further added that many of the wine merchants are also blenders, and where this is so the Committee thinks that the scheme and rates applied to the case of the blenders should be applicable to the wine merchants&apos; businesses, including this element of trade. On the whole, this class, limited, that is to say, to the non-blending wine-merchant class, and also the smaller classes being supplied as under the certificates in regard to sweets, etc., need not be separately handled here, and their interests may be considered to be covered by an inclusive sum which will afterwards be stated, and which is meant to cover these cases as well as the incidental charges which will accompany the transaction. This completes the inquiry with regard to the distributive portion of the licensed trade in Scotland.BREWERIES,124. The Committee now proceeds to the manufacturing trade. These trades are five in number but fall practically into two classes. First, the brewing trade : and a small trade done by bottlers may be dealt with at that point; second, the trades of distillers, of blenders, and of rectifiers. These cases will be considered in their order.. 125. There are seventy breweries in Scotland. The annual net profits of these breweries is  394,080 per annum. Many of the breweries are limited concerns. Some are old businesses in old premises and privately conducted. Other businesses, whether limited or not, are in new and up-to-date premises. The Committee is of opinion with reference to the whole class of manufacturing trades, which are cases of businesses conducted as commercial concerns hy persons, firms, or companies which own the premises, that the entire transaction of purchase must be contemplated as one in. which the Govern-ment is to pay out the manufacturers in both capacities. The Committee resumes consideration of the brewers&apos; trade upon that footing.126. The net annual profits of the brewery trade in Scotland is, as already stated,  394,080. This is the average of the trade done by these breweries during the three pre-war years of 1911, 1912, and 1913. This profit is made not in an ordinary commercial trade, but in a trade subject to, it may be, very con-siderable vicissitudes, so far as Parliamentary action is concerned. It cannot be left out of view that the earlier closing and the advent of local option, both under statute, are not unimportant in that cate-gory. It should be mentioned in regard to this that about two-thirds of the brewing trade in Scotland is a home trade, and to that extent it is within the range of liquor-trade restrictions. It is only just to observe that so far as restriction under local option is concerned, the brewing trade&apos;s contention is correct
that restriction in particular districts, say, particular wards of burghs, would fall with lighter effect upon the sources of supply like breweries because of the increase of custom in the unrestricted areas, and this undoubtedly mitigates, so to speak, the blow of restrictive administration. Where, under Local Veto, prohibition ^particular areas was voted, the same consideration would apply, and it would not be until restriction and prohibition had proceeded to a considerable extent that the effect on the restric-tion of supply by brewers would be so greatly marked. The circumstance of past legislative and future administrative interference must to that extent be discounted.127. There are, however, other serious considerations. The Committee cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the experience of restrictions under the regulations issued by the Central Control Board, and the manner in which these restrictions have been accepted by the population of Scotland, may have an important bearing upon the future of this trade even when normal times are resumed. Nor is it to be left out of view that the straitened finances of the country are not likely to leave taxation of brewing interests in anything like the position that they were in up to the year 1914.128. By that time the general Budget of the country had swollen to over 200 millions per annum. New sources of taxation were being looked for, and after the outbreak of war the following changes, astonishing as regards amount, were made : On 23rd November 1914 the Beer Duty was increased from 7s. 9d. to 23s. per standard barrel, and by the following April to 25s. It is true that these were war duties, and it is also true that during the course of the datum years nothing of the kind could be antici-pated, and that therefore they ought not to enter into the valuation. That is to say, brewers are entitled to have their businesses bought upon a survey of normal conditions. All that can be said upon the sub-ject, however, is that even before the war it was increasingly evident that the trade was subject to con-siderable disturbances both on the lines of restriction and on the lines of taxation.129. As an illustration of the impropriety of introducing war conditions into the calculation so as to depress the volume or value of business, it may be mentioned that on 1st April 1916 production was restricted to 85 per cent, on the basis of the financial year 1915-16, or, alternatively, to 70 per cent, on the basis of the brewing year ending 30th September 1914; while on April 1st 1917 production was restricted to 33^ per cent, on the basis of 1915-16 financial year, or 28 per cent, on the basis of the year ending 30th September 1914. Some variations have been made with regard to these figures, but it is only necessary to look at them to see that it would be improper in a matter of valuation to permit the Government first to limit the supply, and it may be largely to limit the profit, and then to purchase the busi-ness on the scale thus limited by Parliament. This would be to permit the State first to create an abnormal situation, and then to take advantage of its own action by buying at an abnormally low figure during the abnormal period. The Committee, of course, cannot recommend any course of conduct of that description.BREWERS: VALUES.130. The settlement of a figure applicable for the purchase of the brewery trade the Committee has found to be accompanied with very considerable difficulty. It turns out that the cases of transfer which have fallen within the range of the Committee&apos;s experience have not proceeded upon an estimate divided into its elements of profits converted into goodwill and of buildings to which a multiplier as upon data given by the valuation roll could be placed. The difficulty is accentuated by the fact that, attaching all due weight to the testimony placed before it with regard to the accuracy of valuation rolls, the Committee feels. that these rolls, in the case of breweries, do not afford sufficient material for enabling the Committee to say that the annual values there brought forth are either in accord with the books of the concerns involved or with the facts of the case commercially viewed. Some of the buildings are new and excellently adapted to modem requirements; others are old and not so well adapted to these. This difference, however, although not exactly, still to a considerable extent, dees approach the ratio of profits earned on account of the notorious fact that good equipment in the majority of cases runs with good profits. i131. Instances in an opposite direction may occur to the mind, but the Committee inclines to the view that the brewery trade is singular in respect that it is conducted in the brewer&apos;s own buildings and provides, inter alia, large storage accommodation in all cases for the output; and after discussion it thinks that the line of safety in this case is to follow the commercial practice and to state an overhead figure which would cover the value of the brewing businesses and all required in connection therewith, namely, lands and heritages, water rights, moveable plant, tools and utensils, trade marks and good-will. The Committee accordingly fixes an overhead average in this case of eight years&apos; profits, the sums to cover all the items referred to. The minimum would be seven years and the maximum nine vears.   Within these extremes valuation should proceed upon the principles already laid down.132. Taking the eight -years&apos; period just mentioned, the figure reached is  3,152,640. In the opinion of the Committee the entire brewing trade of Scotland, together with all the properties in which the trade is carried on, could be purchased for that sum, in addition to a sum for stock, unascertainable as a precise figure, but which is included in the general covering figure appearing in the financial summary. Evidence was led, it may be mentioned, before the Committee with regard to one brewer, part of whose assets was the possession of several tied houses in England. Such assets are not included in the estimate now furnished, and they would, no doubt, be valued in accordance with the report and action of the Government applicable to the liquor trade in England.133. Other points in connection with this trade, namely, first, the position of firms or limited ccn-cerns which are left in the possession of other assets, say, in land which is not required for the purposes of the business; second, the position of limited concerns in regard to the variety of their holdings, debentures, or otherwise; third, what is the position of the Government with regard to the export business done by all these manufacturing-trades; and fourth, how are companies to be dealt with whose sole or main business is destroyed by the purchase. All these topics will be dealt with after the case of distillers, rectifiers, and blenders, in regard to whom the same questions arise, have been disposed of.
BOTTLERS.134. As the Committee was concluding its evidence testimony was tendered to it by Mr Sillar, who represented the trade of what is known as bottlers. This is a trade which is not of large dimensions, but it is not an allied trade in the sense dealt with in this Report, It must be recognised that the bottler, whose business is conducted on the principle of buying the beer in wholesale quantities from the brewer, of bottling the product and of selling the bottled article to publicans or grocers, is one of those trades which fall within the scope of the inquiry and must be dealt with. Owing to the circumstance of the late arrival of the witness and his inability to furnish statistics, it was impossible for the Committee to do more than to,take note of the position which he formulated. The Committee, however, is of opinion that this class of trade is entitled to the same treatment and recognition as the class of licensed grocers. The distinction between this class of trade and what are called &quot; allied trades &quot; is broadly enough indi-cated by the fact that the bottling trade proceeds only- upon a license; the allied trades require no license for their avocation. No separate sum is indicated in the Report on this head. The resultant figure will no doubt be more than embraced in the sum mentioned for incidentals, as after stated.DISTILLERIES.135.,Distilleries h) Scotland are of two classes, namely, those manufacturing pot-still and those manufacturing patent-still whisky. There have been considerable vicissitudes during the last quarter of a century in regard particularly to the pot-still trade. Reference has been already made to a period of great inflation about twenty years ago. At or about that time, particularly in the north and north-east of Scotland, great expenditure was incurred in the erection of distilleries. It was quite unwarranted by the then condition of the trade, and the future for which it was providing never arrived.136. The production of Scotch whisky far exceeded the consumption. Between the years 1906 and 1905 the excess of whisky stored in warehouse exceeded the removals from bond in Scotland by no less than 18,480,000 gallons. Prices reached a low level, and though in most of the years following 1905 a curtailment took place in production more near to the quantity required for consumption, still prices remained low: a large quantity of spirits still remained in bond. The depression in the trade extended to the whole of it, both to the pot-still and the patent-still whisky trade.137.. In May 1915 the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act came into operation. It provided that no British or foreign spirits should be delivered for home consumption &quot;unless they had been ware-housed for a period of at least three years.&quot; A concession was made, however, as regards rum. From the date of the Act coming into operation, rum was for a period allowed to be taken out of bond after nine months&apos; storage. This nine months was subsequently increased to twelve, and afterwards to fifteen months. The Immature Spirits Act had a marked effect on prices on account of the fact that it was soon realised that there was not a large enough stock of matured home-made spirits in the country to meet the demand for high-class blended whiskies. The figures on this subject are striking. Blended Scotch whiskies, which in 1914 were selling at 3s. 9d. per. gallon in bond, were in August 1917 being sold at 25s. per gallon in bond. Even higher prices have been quoted. On 1st April 1917 the clearances of wines and spirits from bond were restricted to 50 per cent, of the quantity cleared during the year 1916. In the distilling season 1916-1917 malt distilleries were restricted to 70 per cent, of their pro-duction based on an average of the distillation for the last five years.DISTILLERIES: WAR CONSIDERATIONS EXCLUDED.138. These facts have been cited in order to point two considerations. In the first place, it would be manifestly unfair to reckon the volume of business done upon the scale thus abnormally restricted during the period of the..war. Distillers are entitled to be dealt with upon a pre-war footing, and a dis-turbing calculation of this kind should be excluded. On the other hand, the same cause gives rise to a further consideration in the opposite direction. It would be, in the judgment of the Committee, equally out,of the question for distillers, rectifiers, or blenders to ask from the State a price which has been abnormally inflated by reason of special war legislation or regulations. If war considerations are to be excluded, they should be excluded whether resulting in inflation or in deflation. The inflation of price from 3s. 9d. to 25s. per gallon does not exhaust the peculiarities of the case, because under the regulations made as to the dilution of whisky, spirits must now be reduced to 30 under-proof before, sale, and may be reduced to 50 under-proof without &quot;any intimation of such dilution being given. It is quite clear that these extremely abnormal figures could not be made the basis of an assessment of profit, except possibly by stating that if stocks were valued at such figures, no multiple of net annual profits whatsoever should be applied, and that the entire business might justly disappear on a payment of existing value of accumulated stock.DISTILLERS: APPLICATION OF EXCESS PROFITS PRINCIPLE.139. But in the opinion of the Committee a more business-like basis can manifestly be obtained. This is done by simply taking the principle, of the existing law with regard to Excess Profits and applying it to the transaction of purchase of whisky stocks by the State. A valuable memorandum on this sub j ect was issued during the present year, namely, White Paper (Cd. 8623). On the passage of the Finance Bill of this year through the House of Commons, a certain amendment, powerfully supported, was placed upon the Paper with reference to bringing into account the stocks in hand. So important was the subject that the Government laid the position before a Committee of Accountants of the greatest eminence. That Committees opinion was in these terms: &quot; That all stocks of every sort or kind should be valued at the end of each accounting period on the basis of cost price or market value, whichever is the lower. This principle rests upon the theory (which is perfectly&quot; sound) that profits can only be realised by the sale
of commodities, and that no profits can arise by mere increase of value unaccompanied by a sale. To follow this out consistently, stocks&apos;therefore should be carried at their cost price until they are sold and&apos; the profit is ascertained. Where, however, the market price is lower than the cost, a precautionary reserve is permissible for the difference between the cost and the market value.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment adopted this principle.140. What it comes to is this, that inflation of value of stocks, as, for instance, stocks held in bond does not enter the account until these stocks are sold. When, however, the stocks are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, the profit upon the transaction becomes part of the trading profit for the year. It is bevond the province of the Committee to make any legal pronouncement as to whether the transaction of State purchase would fall within the law as it now stands. But the application of the principle of the Excess Profits tax to this transaction is one which it would be expedient to have made thoroughly clear by the Legislature. The sums at stake are too great to leave to the hazard of general expressions in the existing statutes.141. The Committee is not moved by the consideration that this is applying the principle of Excess Profits to what may be termed an excess upon capital. It is not in principle an excess upon capital. If it were, there might be a good deal to be said for the view that that ought to make no difference ; but the safer plan has been adopted by the Inland Revenue of waiting for realisation until the period of striking the excess. But in the case under consideration, namely, purchase by the State, the very period has arrived of removing the article, namely, the whisky in bond, from stocks in hand and including it under the heading of sales.142. Accordingly, all that has to be done in order to subtract from the abnormal inflation already referred to is to allow the operation of the Excess Profits law with regard to them to proceed. Under the operation of the Finance Act, a trader is allowed as a standard profit the average on the basis of the best two of the last three pre-war years.&apos; Further, in the preparation of accounts for excess profits duty, he is entitled in his return to charge to the account: (ft) His stock on hand at the opening of the account; (6) The cost of his purchases (in this case mainly single whiskies); and (c) The working expenses and other necessary charges. On the other side of the account he credits the sales during the accounting period, and any stock on hand at the close.   From the difference between the two sides of the account, being the profit, he is entitled, before striking the sum upon which excess profits duty is paid, to deduct the standard profit and to retain 20 per cent, of the balance.The amount of stocks in bond purchased for the normal figure, and still by virtue of the legislation confined in bond and unrealised, may be taken to be 96,000,000 gallons. As the Committee is of opinion that stocks not in bond but still in the hands both of distillers and blenders should also fall under the principle above mentioned, an addition of 1,000,000 gallons is made under this head. The total quantity is thus 97,000,000 gallons. This amount, put at an average of 25s., would reach the large total of  121,250,000. The correction, however, by the deduction of the 80 per cent, is one which, in order to give a correct view of the effect of purchase as a legislative Act, it is expedient to state now. The 3s. 9d. must be paid. The difference between that and the 25s. is 21s. 3d. Twenty per cent, of this is 4s. 3d. The net purchase figure, accordingly, for such stocks is 3s. 9d. plus 4s. 3d., namely, 8s. a gallon. This sum, multiplied by the number of gallons already mentioned, reaches the figure of  38,800,000.143. The figures just given, although taken at 3s. 9d., would, of course, when the individual transac-tions of purchase came to be carried through, be rectified according to the actual prices paid. The actual prices paid might greatly vary : Mr Ross gave instances of whisky purchased for as low as Is. 6d. per gallon, Lord Forteviot instances of a price of 3s. per gallon, and Mr Marshall 3s. 7d. But the figure upon which the Committee&apos;s calculations proceeds is stated in order to apprise the Government of what in its opinion is, stated roughly, the sum of price which would have to be contemplated. When the individual purchases take place, the estimate would yield to the actual facts of each particular case, and, in this connection, care would, no doubt, be taken by the Government to see that the prices set down represented actual and bonafide transactions.144. The Committee has given much care to the method to be adopted in arriving at the purchase price of the businesses of (1) distillers, as a class, and (2) rectifiers and blenders, as a class. It is true that numbers of traders are engaged in both branches, namely, as distillers and also as rectifiers or blenders. But, in the Committee&apos;s view, the case of the distillers is distinct in principle in this sense that they, bke brewers, are manufacturers, and that they are manufacturers in large and valuable buildings which form a&quot; not inconsiderable quota of their working capital. The buildings also, as in the brewers&apos; case, are often remote and produce the same difficulties with regard to annual or capital valuation. The Corn-mittee, accordingly, thinks that, in this case also, the overhead principle ought to be applied. In the case of distillers the amount of real estate is, when taken as relative to the profit earned, smaller than in that of the brewers ; and the Committee suggest an average multiplier of seven years of the annual profits, with a minimum of six years and a maximum of eight years. The annual profits made from the distillery business, as such, in Scotland were, on an average of the three years already dealt with,  782,040.   This, multiplied by seven, yields an average purchase price of  5,474,280.145. The case of rectifiers and blenders is largely different. They are not manufacturers in the ordinary sense of the term. The stocks they deal in are almost entirely in bond. The buildings neces-sary for the business are relatively smaller in value, and, furthermore, these buildings are more in com-mercio, as, for instance, in large towns and places where the materials open to an assessor in arriving at an annual value are fuller and more trustworthy. It is thus possible to adopt, with more security, the principle of a separate multiple of profits for goodwill, including trade marks, and to add thereto the ascertained value of the buildings, including fixed machinery, water rights, moveable plant, tools and utensils. .146. In the Committee&apos;s opinion the value of the blenders&apos; and rectifiers&apos; businesses is four years&apos; pur-chase. Their average annual profits are  957,880, which, multiplied by four, produces a slump capital sum of  3,831,520.  The annual value of buildings, according to the Valuation Rolls, is about  75,000.
As much of this property is urban and in good situations, an inclusive multiplier of thirteen years might be held to be safe. The resultant figure is  975,000. Of course the individual cases would be settled by individual valuations.REMAINING ASSETS OF FIRMS.147. The Committee now desires to deal with the points already stated as reserved. First: It has been, mentioned to the Committee that the position of firms, and especially limited concerns which are engaged in the manufacture of liquor, ought to be approached by the State from the point of view of the dispos-session of these firms and companies of their entire assets. The case has been figured, say, of a limited, concern, part of whose assets consist of land, houses, or other properties, which are not in point of fact connected with the carrying on of the business either at present or prospective!)7. These properties may have been bought as a means of laying aside surplus capital, or as part of a slump transaction in which assets really required for the business-had to be acquired. But in any case, it appears to the Committee that the problem of the purchase of the liquor trade need not be mixed up with either the use or ownership of assets which are unconnected therewith. There does not seem to be anything to justify the approach of the question of the purchase of the trade on the principle of substitution of the purchaser into the whole rights, property, and assets winch a trading concern may happen to possess. Accordingly, this suggestion is excluded from consideration. The transaction has been confined to its. own proper limits, viz. to the purchase of one particular asset, namely, the trade and the property required for it.   This topic is further referred to under head four.LIMITED COMPANIES.148. Second: The same fallacy as that already alluded to appears to underlie the suggestion as to limited companies. These companies hold ordinary and, it may be, preference stocks. They may also have borrowed some of the money upon debenture or mortgage, having debentures, mortgages, or debenture or mortgage stocks accordingly. The question has been put to the Committee how it is proposed to deal with that variety of stocks. To this question the same answer is given. What is being purchased, and the entire compass of the transaction of purchase, has reference to one particular asset, namely, the business and the property used or required for that business. With the distribution of the sum so acquired the Government has no concern. It may be that a Limited Company has traded largely on borrowed capital. This indeed may also be in the case of any firm or private trader, but it is no necessary consequence that the purchaser of a particular asset is concerned with the distribution of that asset. The Company from whom it has purchased has the duty to pay its debts and divide its capital according to its legal obligations.   This point is also further dealt with under head four.EXPORT TRADE OF BREWERS AND DISTILLERS.149. Third : Anxious inquiry was made on the subject of whether it was possible for the State to acquire the home manufacturing business of brewers, distillers, and blenders to the exclusion of their export trade. The Committee have little hesitation in accepting the verdict of such men as Sir George Younger, representing the brewers, and Lord Forteviot, representing the distillers, to the effect that it will be practically impossible to split up these trades by purchasing, so to speak, one fraction and leaving the existing owners in possession of the other to be handled along with stone and lime, business con-nection, and all the rest, but confined merely to export. There would be inevitable, and perhaps insuper-able, difficulties in attempting any allocation on a footing of this kind, and although the difficulties of the position are realised, no course seems open, except to advise the Government that if the policy of purchase be adopted it ought to be purchase of the entire trading concern as it stands.150. It has to be borne in mind that in each of the cases of distilling, rectifying and blending, and of brewing, one-third of the business is Colonial or export trade. And the Government is accordingly confronted with the proposition that if it is to acquire, for reasons which are social reasons, promoted by social demands arising at home, these businesses, it will have on its hands a very considerable export trade. The Government must, hi the opinion of the Committee, face this whole position. It is open to it afterwards, if so advised, to use the distilleries solely for national needs in the making of alcohol for manuf acturing or medicinal purposes. And it is possible to figure a case of prohibition which would thus limit the operations. Whether when such an event occurred it would be possible for the Government to maintain the supply to foreign peoples, or to our own Colonies, a supply which had been extinguished for social reasons at home, all these things are matters of policy for the Government to consider. But the situation with regard to purchase is, in the Committee&apos;s opinion, as stated.LIQUIDATION OF LIMITED COMPANIES.151. Fourth: The case remains of Limited Companies whoseraison cVelre was destroyed by reason of the purchase. Such companies might be in possession of considerable assets, but yet in effect and even by its Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association might be limited for trading purposes, to the manufacture of drink. Accordingly, when the principal, if not the sole, object of its existence was removed, the question arises, what would then have to be done 1 This is one of the arguments underlying the suggestion that the State should buy out the companies as a whole, but, in the opinion of the Committee, what ought to be done is much simpler.152. The Committee recommend that the Act of Purchase should operate if so jure as a ground for liquidation. The principle of this is perfectly familiar in Company Law. In 1867 it was authori-tatively decided that it was just and equitable that a Company should be wound up when &quot; the whole.
substratum of tbe partnership the whole business which the Company was incorporated to carry on  has become impossible &quot; per Lord Cairns in re Suburban Hotel Company, 2 Ch. Ap. 750. This decision has been frequently followed by the Courts. The Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908, by section 182, provides that a Company may be wound up voluntarily if, by Special Resolution, it so resolves. The Committee recommends that, should a Purchase Act be passed into law, it should contain a section declaring that such passage should operate as if Companies whose business was affected by it had passed Special Resolutions for voluntary winding-up. As to such company&quot;so placed in liquidation, the liquidation would be conducted under well-known rules, and the duty of the Liquidator would be to collect the assets, including the great and principal asset of the sum received from the State, and thereafter to distribute the assets in payment of the debts due, and according to the priority to which they were entitled by law, and thereafter to distribute the remaining assets, all in terms of the Memorandum and Articles of Association. It would be competent for the Court, in its discretion, to make, under section 199 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, on application to it, an order that the voluntary winding-up should continue, but subject to the supervision of the Court.TOTALS.153. The sum of purchase price thus due from the State would be to gather the figures above set forth as per : Condensed Summary.1.

This figure is based upon the data already mentioned. But the Committee, in view of the changing values of this class of stock, again calls attention to possible alterations in such data, and to the uncertainty of the operation of the rules regarding standard pre-war profit, which would, of course, affect the sum of this item.The figure in item 7, namely,  2,250,000, includes the items referred to in the Report as unascertain-able with the precision which would have justified separate entries, namely, the goodwill of the grocers&apos; licensed trade, the possible compensation to landlords of certain grocers&apos; premises, the amount to be paid to such wine merchants as are not already included in the entries applicable to rectifiers and blenders or grocers. The award to be made to bottlers and also brewers&apos; stocks. It is also given as including all the. expenses of law, arbitration, and valuation.154. In return for this, in addition to the major consideration of securing control, the Government would be invested in all the businesses named. It would also be invested in very large and valuable assets in the shape of land, buildings, and stocks.155. It will be for the consideration of the Government in what form the purchase prices should be made to the various vendors. This Committee, while of course leaving the matter in the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government, thinks it right to make this observation, that the accounts of the Nation should be so kept that the financing of this particular transaction should be in such a form as to facilitate a survey at all reasonable financial intervals of the question of the State&apos;s conduct of the liquor trade.156. It is unnecessary to make any Summary of Recommendations, as such recommendations appear at the end of each separate heading of this Report.157. The Committee cannot conclude its labours without expressing its high admiration of the unwearied labours and exceptional skill of its Secretary, Mr Norman Macpherson. He has had in the course of the inquiry to have communications not only with Government Departments, more particu-larly with Inland Revenue officials, but also with Public Authorities in various parts of the country and with traders, and in the course of these communications the Committee feels that his ability and unfailing courtesy have stood it well in securing for it masses of fact and avenues of information whick might otherwise have been lost to the public.
 &apos; 158. To Mr Cotton&apos;s services,whichthe Committee much appreciates, it has also referred; but the Committee desires again to mention in particular the conspicuously laborious work of Mr Blair of the Inland Revenue, Chief Government Valuer in Scotland. The Committee does not overestimate those labours by saying that it would have been impossible for it, without his assistance and that of his staff, and also, it may add, without the much appreciated and very highly skilled aid of Mr Stamp and the Inland Revenue and Custom Authorities in England to conclude its labours in anything like the time allotted.159. It may not be out of place, further, to record that the evidence furnished, and the documents laid before the Committee by the trade have been of great service, and have been supplemented &quot;in an especially clear and helpful manner by Mr Ross, Managing Director of the Distillers&apos; Company, Limited, and by Mr C. H. Marshall of Messrs. James Watson &amp; Co., Limited, Dundee.We have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servants,SHAW OF DUNFERMLINE, Chairman. WM. ADAMSON (subject to reservation below).

I, however, desire to state that I entirely disagree with the basis upon which the members of the Committee propose to compensate the various interests in the Trade, and, in particular, with the very large sums of money which would be involved in giving effect to their proposals, the amount of compensation being, in my opinion, out of all proportion to the interests at stake.WM. ADAMSON.(2) By Mr Meiklejohn and Sir Thomas Munro.While we have signed the Report of the Majority as we are in agreement with its main conclusions, we desire to associate ourselves with the signatories of the Minority Report in their statement at the beginning of their Report, viz : &quot; The Report of the Majority contains much material beyond the strictly limited terms of the remit made to us by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It embraces expressions of opinion on disputable points and speculations as to the future action of the Government, of Local Authorities, and of bodies of electors. On these matters we offer no opinion; we are content to observe that in our view they are irrelevant to the enquiry on which we have been engaged and therefore ought not to be included in the findings of the Committee.&quot;As regards the acquisition of whisky stocks, the procedure suggested in Paragraphs 39 and 40 of the Report of the Minority provides, in our opinion, a better principle upon which to work than can be obtained from the method proposed in the Report of the Majority. Under any scheme, however, there is risk that, in the acquisition of a commodity at the artificially inflated price now prevailing, the Exchequer may be involved in heavy financial loss when normal conditions for the sale and distribution of whisky recur.R.

minority report.To The Right Hon. Robert Munro, His Majesty&apos;s Secretary for Scotland.Sir,  .       4We regret that we are unable to sign the Report of the majority, and feel obliged to present a separate Report.From the latter, it will be observed that we do not differ materially from the conclusions of the majority in regard to the terms on which the businesses of retail dealers, brewers, and distillers should be acquired, and not at all as to the process of acquisition; and that, while we do not adopt the method on which the majority of the Committee propose to proceed in calculating the amount to be paid as com-pensation of blenders, our dissent from the majority, even on that point, is a matter of detail. Had there existed no further difference between us and the other members of the Committee, we should have considered it our duty to sign the Report and present a brief memorandum embodying our views on the points of difference. But we feel that the Report as finally adjusted contains matter which we cannot allow to be issued as the result of our considered judgment, and we are therefore to our regret precluded from adopting this course. The Report contains much material beyond the strictly limited terms of the remit made to us by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It embraces expressions of opinion on disputable points and speculations as to the future action of the Government, of local authorities, and of bodies of electors. On these matters we offer no opinion; we are content to observe that in our view they are irrelevant to the inquiry on which we have been engaged, and, therefore, ought not to be included in the findings of the Committee.We have endeavoured in the Report which follows to restrict ourselves to the matters referred to us, and to express the opinions we have arrived at thereon as briefly and succinctly as possible.1. The terms of the remit are as printed.2. We are of the opinion that control of the Liquor interests during an indefinite period with pur-chase in prospect at a later date is not expedient nor in accordance with sound business principles. Difficulties of many sorts would arise during the interregnum and lead to large claims on the State. If there is to be State purchase at all it should precede or accompany control, not follow it.3. The terms of purchase should, in our opinion, be based in each case upon profits arrived at by the application of the same rules to each branch of the trade acquired. The profit is what the seller parts with, and it should form the basis on which compensation is paid ; so that if a fair standard of com-putation of profit be fixed, all that remains to be done is to apply the appropriate number of years&apos; purchase looking to the nature of the assets acquired.4. A basis is found in the standard profit allowed under the provisions of the Finance Acts with regard to excess profits duty. The principle under which the taxpayer makes up his returns for excess profits duty is well known and in general use. From the profit brought out he is entitled to deduct his standard profit, which, speaking broadly, consists of the average of the best two of the last three pre-war years. We recommend the adoption of this standard in each of the cases after mentioned, subject to such adjustments as are necessary to ensure equality of treatment.This general rule may require qualification where, for example, an old business has been added to or a new business has been set up, or where the business has been closed in whole or in part during the standard period, or where there has been capital expenditure after the close of the standard period : these points will be dealt with later.PROCEDURE.5. Before going on to deal with trades individually, it may be convenient to suggest what the pro-cedure might be. There is in existence a Liquor Control Board which has done valuable work in certain areas in Scotland in regulating, after purchase, the liquor traffic in these areas. We suggest that a new Board of Purchase and Control be set up with wider powers than those of the existing Board, enabling it to adopt all necessary means for carrying through the task of purchase, including fulfpowers of exami-nation into books and statements, and the employment of valuers where negotiations fail to result in agreement.Each case, in our opinion, must form the subject of separate investigation by the Board, and the Board would have power to arrange the purchase price within the limits hereinafter indicated. Failing agree-ment, and in the event of the seller failing to justify before the valuer as arbiter his refusal of an offer by the Board, the expenses of the arbitration proceedings would be borne by him.6. We do not think it necessary to set out the licensing law in Scotland ; it may be sufficient to note the following points with regard to the retail trade : (1.) The licence is personal to the licensee ; (2) Each certificate is granted for one year ;(3) It is subject to increasingly drastic regulations enforced by the public authority ; and (4) The Temperance (Scotland) Act of 1913, which comes into operation in 1920, gives to the electors in prescribed areas control over the grant and renewal of certificates.In all these points we understand that Scottish law differs from English law.
7. The different interests concerned are dealt with under the following heads : (A) Public-houses and inns or hotels whose essential business is a public-house business.(B) Licensed grocers.(C) Hotels proper, with which may be classed restaurants, theatres, etc.(D) Wine merchants, bottlers, etc.(E) Brewers and distillers. (P) Blenders.(G) Allied trades.(H) Compensation:(a) Property owners; (6) Employees.Finally, an estimate of the total cost is given.A. PUBLIC-HOUSES.8. Licences are held by 5024 public-houses, and 1533 inns and hotels of which the greater number could not exist without their public-house trade. In Scotland tied houses are practically unknown. Cases do exist where a brewer or distiller, or both, have made loans to a publican or hotel-keeper in order to get his trade in beer and whisky, but there is no real tie. The borrower is free, on paying off the debt, to make his purchases where he desires.9. As mentioned, the licence is personal to the licensee. It is a grant for one year and no longer. This is used as an argument against compensation for loss of the licence. How, it is asked, can there be goodwill when the licence may not be renewed at next Licensing Court ?On the other hand, it is undoubted that these licences, limited as they are, have a market value. This value has been recognised, not only by the Law Courts in finding the amount payable for the goodwill of a licensed business, but also by the State in the assessment of death duty. Goodwill is the principal element in the price of the transfer of a licensed business, and forms a substantial part of a, deceased publican&apos;s estate, on which death duties are charged. Further, the licence has been an element in fixing the annual value of property for taxation.10. We are clearly of opinion that if the goodwill of a business is a subject for taxation by the State, it is reasonable that the State should pay for acquiring it.11. We are satisfied, from the evidence led, that although the number of public-houses, in relation to the population served, has been reduced, there has been a general decrease in the value of goodwill of licensed businesses for many years. Evidence was received that this decline has been going on for years past, and that the passing of the Temperance (Scotland) Act of 1913 has accelerated it. Those in the trade, though they made light of the risks involved, are widely insured against the risks, and the same feeling of uncertainty which led to insuring has naturally lowered prices.12. Evidence was received not only that the Licensing Courts favour the reduction of licences, but also that there is a change in the habits of the people which tends in the same direction.13. Having considered the evidence on the subject of the reduction in number of licensed houses and as to the values put on goodwill of licensed businesses for death duties, and also the circumstances attending the purchases by the Liquor Control Board, we are of opinion that the value of &quot;the goodwill of the public-house businesses in Scotland may be taken at three and one-half years&apos; purchase of the standard profit. In order to provide for exceptional cases the Board should be authorised to vary the number of years&apos; purchase between a maximum of four years&apos; and a minimum of two years&apos;.14. The State, in addition to the price, should pay for tenants&apos; fixtures and movable fittings and utensils and for stocks, all as valued, and should relieve the seller of current contracts, including his obligations under lease, entered into bona fide before the issue of this Report.B. LICENSED GROCERS.15. In this trade the steady decrease is quite as noticeable as in the case of the publican, and we suggest that the same principles be applied. It is impossible, however, from the return for excess profits duty, to separate the profit for the liquor branch of the grocer&apos;s business from the rest of his earnings. An overhead estimate must therefore be made ; and we think that the profit accruing from this part of the grocer&apos;s trade may be set down as two-thirds of the total. Fair compensation, in our view, for the loss of their liquor trade by grocers may be estimated at two years&apos; purchase of two-thirds of their standard profit, with a maximum of three years&apos; and a minimum of one year&apos;s purchase. Fixtures, fittings, etc., of the licensed business should be dealt with as in the case of publicans.C. HOTELS.16. As already mentioned, the number of inn and hotel licences is 1533, many of them held for houses all over the country which do little else than a public-house trade. AVhere the inn or hotel is essentially a pubbc-house, it falls into and should be dealt with in the category of public-houses, but in hotels proper the supply of liquor is only incidental to the business ; the main trade is to supply board and lodging to people who are from home. The profits from the two classes cf business, the one the lodging and feeding of guests, the other supplying them with liquor, cannot be separated, and any estimate of the cost of compensation is difficult to make. We have no reliable data, but the amount involved is not relatively large.   It is provided for in the total after mentioned.
,   RESTAURANTS, THEATRES, ETC.17. Here, again, the supply of liquor is only incidental, and it is &quot;difficult to separate the profit upon liquor from that derived from provisions.18. In these cases, as in the case of the licensed grocer, we have no reliable data to enable us to distinguish the profit from the trade done in liquor from the general profit, but this can doubtless be done by. the Purchase Board in individual cases. We estimate the compensation at three and one-half years&apos; purchase of two-thirds of the standard profit, with a maximum of five years&apos; and a minimum of two years&apos;.19. It is perhaps right to observe that we have dealt only Avith the acquisition of the liquor dealing part of the businesses of licensed grocers, hotels and restaurants, and the proper compensation therefor. We have no observation to make as to the procedure after purchase, which is a matter not for us but for His Majesty&apos;s Government.20. No evidence was adduced relative to clubs, and therefore we do not consider that any claim which they might have can be dealt with satisfactorily in this Report.d. WINE MERCHANTS, BOTTLERS, ETC.21. In so far as wine merchants are also blenders, we think that they should come under the.scheme and rates which are applied to the case of blenders as after mentioned.22. The interests of wine merchants who are not blenders, of bottlers who buy beer in bulk and bottle it on maturity, and of those who hold certificates in regard to sweets, etc, are not relatively large, and are included in the amount afterwards to be stated.MANUFACTURING TRADES.23. These trades fall practically into three classes first, the brewing trade; second, the trade of distillers and rectifiers ; third, the trade of blenders. It may be noted that the whisky blender is in effect a manufacturer. He buys single whiskies from the distiller, blends them according to the taste of his market, and advertises and sells the blend under distinctive trade marks and labels. These three trades will be considered in their order.24. A distinction falls to be noted between the brewing and distilling trades on the one hand, and the blending trade on the other. In the former case the traders own ground and buildings, machinery and plant, water rights, and other fixed assets which, have cost large sums. In the latter case, that of the blenders, the cost of the fixed assets is relatively small.25. As regards movables, the contrast is equally marked in the other direction. The amount of stock held by brewers and distillers is comparatively small, but in the blenders&apos; case, especially since the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1915, compelled the retention of spirits in bond for three years after distillation, the stock of whiskies, single and blended, is extremely large. It is proposed to deal first with brewers and distillers, and afterwards with blenders.It should perhaps be noted that distillers carry on as part of their manufacturing business a very considerable trade in the making and distribution of yeast, and to a less extent of malt extract and methylated spirit. Evidence was given to the Committee that about one-half of the distillers&apos; yeast used in the United Kingdom is produced by the Scottish patent-still distillers. The yeast business is so closely connected with that of the manufacture of spirits as to be inseparable from it.E. BREWERS AND DISTILLERS.26. Three schemes have been suggested for the valuation of the brewing and distilling trades-first, that the fixed assets be separately valued, that stock be taken, and that to the aggregate of these two sums a certain number of years&apos; purchase of the profits be added for goodwill; second, that a number of years&apos; purchase of the profits be fixed as fair compensation foT the whole asset acquired, namely, buildings, goodwill, and stocks ; and third, that a number of years&apos; profits be taken as the value of the fixed assets and goodwill, and that stocks be separately valued. It is this last method which we recommend.27. In our opinion the price to be paid for the brewing and distilling trades should be based on (a) For lands and heritages, movable plant, tools and utensils, water rights, trade marks and goodwill, eight years&apos; purchase of the standard profit, with a maximum of ten years&apos; and a minimum of six years&apos;, plus (b) The value of the stocks as valued for the Purchase Board, material, raw or in process, being valued at cost, &apos;and the finished product on the lines recommended below in the case of blenders.28. Two points in connection with these trades are first, the position of concerns which own other assets not directly required for the purpose of the business, say, surplus lands and houses ; and second, the position of the Government with regard to export business carried on by these manufacturers.29. On the first point it seems clear that no heritage should be considered as included in the price unless its use has entered into the profits of the manufacturing trade acquired, and that all the heritage which has helped to earn the profit on which the price is based should be included. Inquiry into each case would be necessary to show what was to be taken as covered and what was not. Certain brewers and distillers are the owners of property, such as workmens houses and warehouses, which are not necessary adjuncts to the process of manufacture. We think, in order to equalise matters between those who own such property and those who do not, that the owner should be paid a fair price for such property,-say seventeen and one-half years&apos; purchase of the assessed rental, which, in this case, should
be an economic rental. The number of years&apos; purchase of the profits of the manufacturing business is not to be held to cover this property, which does not belong to that business.30. On the second point, as to the export trade, it was made clear to us that it could not be carried on without the home trade, and it seems to us necessary, that being the case, that the Government should pay compensation. What is to be done with the export business after purchase is a question of policy.F. BLENDERS.31. Blenders are the owners of the greater part of the large stocks of whisky in bond estimated at about 97,000,000 gallons. That whisky has advanced from an average pre-war price of about 3s. 9d. per gallon to prices which are quite abnormal and still rising. It is clear that purchase at anything like the present market value would involve enormous figures.32. This one element in the problem of suggesting the financial terms on which the Liquor interests of the country may be purchased by the State presents the greatest difficulty of all those involved in the remit. If the advance in price was due purely to market conditions, and the operation of supply and demand in normal times, there might be considerable justification for an argument that the seller should receive the market value for his stock. Prior to the War, except as regards the export trade, the out-look for blenders was by no means bright. As has been stated above, there had been, for many years, steady and progressive decline in the number of licensed premises, which are the staple customers of the home trade. The stock of manufactured whisky represented three or four years&apos; supply, and in the event of any considerable adoption of the No-licence resolution under the Temperance (Scotland) Act, 1913, the holding of these stocks was not unattended by risks. The War has changed all that. Distilleries, except a few pot-still distilleries, are no longer employed in the manufacture of whisky. The Imma-ture Spirits Restriction Act of 1915 prevents the sale of whisk)&apos; under three years old. The excess profits duty provisions of the Finance Act tend towards the holding back of whisky from sale till the duty is taken off, and, lastly, the talk of State purchase has not been without effect in raising prices.33. If there is a clear case of enhanced value due to War conditions, it is this; and if the Government, under these conditions, feel constrained to fix maximum prices for many kinds of food, there can be no grievance if they apply the same rule to the Liquor trade. The present inflated values are largely due to Government action, and Government action might as easily deflate them.34. With all these circumstances in mind, we have carefully considered the basis of price to be paid for these stocks, and are clearly of opinion that values arrived at under present conditions do not give any fair basis of price for acquisition by the State.35. It has been suggested that the objections to acquiring the stocks at present values may be over-come by fixing on the market price but making the profit on sale subject to the provisions of the Finance Act with regard to excess profits duty. It may be as well to explain what these are. Under the opera-tion of the Finance Act, as already stated, a trader is allowed as a standard profit the average of the best two of the last three pre-war years. Further, in the preparation of accounts for excess profits duty he is entitled in his return to charge to the account (a) The stock on hand at the opening of the account at cost or market value, which ever is the lower;(6) The cost of his purchases ; and(c) The working expenses and other necessary charges.On the other side of the account he credits the sales and the value as above of any stock on hand at the close. From the difference between the two sides of the account, being the profit, he is entitled, before striking the sum upon which excess profits duty is paid, to deduct the standard profit and to retain 20 per cent, of the balance.36. There are here two elements of difficulty in estimating what the profits of the blenders on a sale of their stocks would be. First, no information is available as to the average cost of the single whiskies bought and used by the blenders. The cost may vary between very wide limits. Second, the market, value, or whatever the purchase price may be, is equally undetermined.37. Another method of arriving at a fair sum which has occurred to us is that the Purchase Board should endeavour to come to an arrangement with the Trade, and, failing agreement, that the question of price should be arranged on the basis of bonafide cost plus a sum (to be fixed by arbitration) based on the average profit per gallon obtained from stock sold during the standard period, out with a wide margin to ensure that in each case similar prices are paid for similar goods.This would not be practicable : the variations in first cost, to take one element alone, are too great.38. A third suggestion is that an overhead figure per gallon be fixed more or less arbitrarily as a maximum price. There are, of course, numerous precedents for this under War conditions, but the impossibility of arriving at a fair figure leads us to discard the suggestion.39. After the best thought that we can give to the question, our judgment is that the first named-the application of the principle of the excess profits duty-will work out more equitably than any other method, and in our opinion this principle should be adopted, the purchase price of each class of whisky being fixed at the average price realised for whisky of similar age, quality, and strength during the last six mor,ths of 1916.40. We are quite alive to the fact that under any method it is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the cost to the State of this, the largest individual item which State purchase would involve, and that any fair basis of price adopted may make State purchase financially prohibitive, having regard to the fact that large stocks would be held at artificial prices, with no certainty that they could subsequently be sold at anything approaching the same level.41. It ought to be noticed that in some instances distillers have also a considerable blending business, the separate profits of which cannot be ascertained from the Income-tax returns. It is onlv with the assistance of leading representatives of the trade that figures have been got which show the total profit
derived from each branch, so that the different rates of multiplier can be applied. Similarly, but on a much smaller scale, blenders carry on the business of distillers.&apos; It has been possible by elimination to arrive approximately at the profits of the blending business separately.42. As regards goodwill, on the footing that the stocks are acquired on a basis from which this element is entirely eliminated, we are of opinion that four years&apos; purchase of the profits would be fair.43. In this case also, as in the case of distillers, it seems right that those who own property not directly required in the business should receive payment for it beyond the value of their business. In our opinion they should be paid for their property on the basis of seventeen and one-half years&apos; purchase of the assessed rental, which in this case also should be an economic rent.44. In the case of retail traders the Act of 1913 may be considered as a warning of possible ex-propriation, and may reasonably be held to affect the value of their trade, but in the case of manufacturers this element does not apply to the same extent, and we are of opinion that when the State deprives a person of his business at a time which suits the State without reference to the convenience or pecuniary interests of the person dispossessed it is not unreasonable that a percentage over and above the bare market value should be allowed. In the present case, however, we consider that the provisions for compensation recommended in our Report are sufficient to provide for this.It is to be noted that under the scheme outlined above, each manufacturer will be left in possession of the remaining assets of his business, such as debtors, investments, and cash.EXPORT TRADE OF BREWERS, DISTILLERS, AND BLENDERS.45. As to the use that the Government might make of the foreign trade we offer no opinion, but we mention the suggestion made by a witness that the export business might be resold to a Company or Companies wbo will get their supplies from the Government and export them to their foreign customers.G. ALLIED TRADES.46. We are of opinion that no case has been made out at this stage for the purchase of trades which are subsidiary to, or allied with, those above mentioned. It is not certain that purchase by the Govern-ment means the closing down of these trades, nor that if and when they are closed down the Government will not deal with them equitably.H. COMPENSATION.47. Claims under this head may fall into two categories (a) by owners of heritable licensed property for compensation for loss of the licence, and (b) by employees for loss of their employment. We are of opinion that under neither head can claims arise at this stage. Such claims, if they arise at all, will arise under the administration of the Board which the Government ma)&apos; set up, and should be dealt with out of the profits of working.CASES OF HARDSHIP.48. It may be that under the scheme outlined above there are eases of genuine hardship which are not provided for. There may, for example, be cases where trades were closed during the three years prior to the War ; or again, the nature of the trade carried on may have materially changed; or a new trade may have sprung up; or again, the loss of the licensed part of a business may make the rest of the trade valueless. All these cases require separate consideration. It should be a direction to the Purchase Board to deal with such cases, but only on claims made by persons who allege hardship. Should any claim fail, we think that the Board should have the power to find the claimant liable in expenses.ESTIMATED COST.49. Taking the whole trade, manufacturing and distributing, wholesale and retail, we estimate, -on the basis above set forth, and on the figures supphed to us, that the total cost, exclusive of stocks and surplus heritage as above mentioned, may amount to  24,000,000.50. We think it proper to point out that, in the event of purchase by the State, the revenue drawn from excise and licence duties will cease. This consideration does not affect the price, which is arrived at on the basis of profits from which these duties have been deducted; but, as these sources of revenue will disappear, their loss will require to be provided for in the annual Budget estimate after purchase.51. We desire to express our deep obligation to Mr Blair, Chief Government Valuer for Scotland to the Board of Inland Revenue; to Mr Stamp, Assistant Secretary of the Board of Inland Revenue; and to Mr. D. N. Cotton, C.A., Edinburgh, for their help in the inquiry ; and we heartily concur with the other members of Committee in expressing our admiration of the zeal and talent of &quot;the Secretary to the Committee, Mr Norman Macpherson.  His services have been invaluable.We have the honour to be, Sir, *&apos;   Your obedient Servants,CHARLES KER. JOHN M. MACLEOD.Glasgow, 26$ December 1917.
