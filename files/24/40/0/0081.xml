-1 Dolose! toesfrti- ^fe^cument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]      A&quot;1!Printed for the War Cabinet^ January 1938.SECRET.MEMORANDUM ON A FURTHER CUT IN MUNITIONSTONNAGE.1. THE Ministry of Munitions has received intimation from the Ministry of Shipping that in order to import specially large quantities of food and cereals for ourselves and our Allies during February and March, a reduction of 160,000 tons must be made in the February allocation of tonnage from North America to other departments ; and it is proposed that 80 per cent, of this reduction should come off munitions. This cuts the munitions requirements from North Atlantic ports from 252,000 to 125,000 tons in February, and the memorandum implies that a similar cut may have to be made in March.2. If this drastic alteration is only an acceleration of the ship-ment of food and a postponement of munitions, the reduced munition programme for 1918 can be carried out by living during these two months to the utmost on stocks of material in this country. It is, however, essential that there should be a firm guarantee of a subse-quent allocation of the equivalent tonnage.3. It is understood that the Ministry is to be asked to postpone shipments from the United States during the coining three months in order to release shipping for the transport of American personnel. No precise figure of the tonnage involved has yet been put before us. But if it is at all appreciable, the munitions situation will not stand such a postponement in addition to this postponement for the sake of food.4. The memorandum of the Shipping Controller indicates that in spite of the drastic cuts made by the Mi!ner Committee in November and December, the departmental demands are still 2,500,000 tons in excess of the prospective import capacity for 191s. Far, therefore, from suggesting that tonnage now transferred to food will be returned to munitions, it is implied that further very considerable cuts will have to be made in shipping requirements on the North Atlantic or on other routes. If the Shipping Controller^ case is substantiated, and if the same proportion of these further cuts is to be taken off munitions as is now proposed in the Shipping Controllers memorandum, i.e., 80 per cent., the munitions budget will have to be cut by another 2,000,000 tons (viz., SO per cent, of 2,500,000 tons).5. It is therefore essential that a ruling should be given (a) as to the amount of tonnage covered by the priority given to food and (b) as to the proportion of the prospective deficit to be taken off items other than those of food and munitions.6. In this connection it is to be remembered that a cut of 1,500,000 tons of munitions has already been made, not on the amount which the Ministry of Munitions required to fulfil the programmes for 1918 put before them, but on the amount imported in 1917.   In round numbers, the figures are as follows : (a.) Tonnage needed in 1918 to cover full programmes put before the Ministry of Munitions ...(b.) Amount imported in 1917(c.) Amount to be imported in 1918 under the ruling of the Milner Committee ...(d.) Amount available for munitions if 80 per cent, of Shipping Controllers prospec-tive deficit is to come off munitions ... [193]Tons.15,000,000 12,500,00011,000,00012
Thus, in the worst event, we shall only get 60 per cent, of the tonnage needed for the full munitions programme.7. The cut of 1,500,000 tons for the Ministry of Munitions, as already budgeted, involves the following consequences : (a.) The gun ammunition programme has been cut by nearly 20 per cent., in spite of the fact that the artillery programme, to which the Ministry of Munitions and the War Office have been working for the last two years, both as regards personnel as well as materiel, does not reach its maximum until the spring of this year. The effect upon the French theatres of war will be reduced as far as possible by the cessation of all supplies to Prussia, by a cut in the allocation of ammunition to theatres of war other than France, and by using in the field a considerable proportion of stocks of ammunition accumulated in Great Britain (i.e., at the expense of a culminating effort which it would otherwise be possible to make in 1919). The actual ammunition in France will therefore be slightly larger than in 1917, but will be less in proportion to the guns which will be in the field.The programme so arranged will make the Allies on the Western fronts slightly, though definitely, inferior to the Central Powers in the total tonnage of ammunition, according to the best and latest estimates of enemy capacity available. It will make the British army inferior to the French army both in numbers of rounds and weight of shell.The programme definitely rules out the possibility of any further increase in 1919 over 1918. (6.) The budget allows the Admiralty an unreduced 2,000,000 tons of steel in&apos; 1919. I understand unofficially that the Admiralty do not yet see their way to meet their requirements on this allocation. Every ton given to the Admiralty must come directly off the ammunition for the Army.(c.) The steel available for public services and commerce will have to be still more drastically curtailed and railways and building construction starved.(d.) It is only possible to include in the budget half the quantity of phosphate rock authorised by the War Cabinet for the Food Production Department (i.e., 300,000 tons out of 600,000 tons).8. If a further cue is made on the Ministry it can practically only be met in bulk frpm finished steel and iron ore, and the Cabinet must say to what extent the Navy, the Army, and the public services respectively are to bear the reduction.  .9. In stating that such reduction must come directly off supplies available for various services it must be borne in mind that, in connection with the previous reduction, a careful scrutiny of stocks was made to see where economies could be effected, and there is nothing further to be gained by reducing accumulations, as full credit has been taken in estimating supplies available in 1918 for the lighting services for the reduction of stocks to a minimum by the end of 1918.10. There remains a possible source from which a small economy of tonnage could be made, viz., by the importation of finished muni-tions instead of raw material. For example, a very small economy might be obtained by importing pig-iron from the United States instead of a larger quantity of ore from Spain, though the saving is a very small percentage when account is taken of the longer distance of the journey to America.
A more important saving of tonnage could be effected if the Ministry could buy completed explosives and propellant from America instead of importing nitrate from Chile and pyrites from the Mediter-ranean. Tonnage could also be saved by importing finished shell or complete rounds from Canada and the United States, instead of steel, &amp;c. But though all these devices reduce tonnage, the fact that labour in other countries would be used to perform work hitherto done here means that a larger indebtedness would be incurred abroad.In view of the ruling of the Gabinet of the 16th January that the Ministry of Munitions is to consider, on account of the shortage of dollars, *&apos; the possibility of the cancellation or postponement of delivery of existing contracts,&quot; there seems little.prospect of tonnage being saved at the expense of dollars.11. But anyhow it is desirab e to have something settled, and when settled adhered to. We required to maintain the full activity of steel production an average of approximately 650,000 tons of iron ore from Spain per month. We reduced our demand to 500,000 tons a month to meet tonnage requirements at the Milner Committee. We actually got in January 280,000 tons. Nitrates are in a similar position. Our reserves have fallen from 300,000 tons six months&apos; ago to less than 100,000 tons now, and in two months&apos; time we shall be down to 40,000 tons or about one month&quot; s supplies. The French and Italians are already destitute.12. War is carried on primarily by steel and explosives. They constitute a fairly true measure of war effort. But they have been consistently side-tracked during the last six months for every other form of import. We are, in fact, following along the line of least reistance and&apos; allowing our war efforts to fall short of what is necessary to gain the victory.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.January 24, 1918.
