SECRET.(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government)MINISTRY OF FOOD,ColonelJonesJiTEB^getSrt&quot; for Week ending Wednesday, January 23, 1918.2?PART I. ACTION  TAKEN.At the Aldwych Club, on January 18, Lord Rhondda reviewed the food situation.: He stated that if people would realise the position, and act up to : the necessities of the case, there was no fear of famine. Whatever restrictions it might be necessary to impose would ensure the consumer 50 per cent, more than had for some time been given in Germany. He thought that the richer classes had responded more generally than the poorer classes to the appeal for economy in consumption.. In,view of the diversion of large quantities of grain to our Allies it was proposed to raise the percentage of extraction to 90. The anxiety of the farmers had; been -relieved by the discovery that they could make 75s. per live cwt. for fat cattle; but as cattle generally were lean a temporary shortage was inevitable. An, additional protection, to the interests of the consumer would be found in the Consumers&apos; Council which, at; Mr. dynes&apos; suggestion, he was setting up in the Ministry of Food. He expressed his willingness to increase the membership of Local Food Committees so as to admit increased representation of labour, women, and the co-operative movement. ;Orders under the Defence of the Realm : Regulations. The following Orders have been issued from the Ministry during the week : (1) The Deer (Restriction of Feeding) Order, 1918, dated. 14 January, 1918, prohibits after January 21st the feeding of: deer with cereals or other . provided food except with acorns, chestnuts, or salt,, or with hay grown within the deer forest, park, or other area in which the deer are preserved. .     .     .- (2) The Fish (Prices) Order, 1918, dated 16 January, 1.9.18, fixes the maximum-retail prices of fish after January 23. Food Committees are given powers to vary the prices in their areas, but may? not increase the maximum without the sanction of the Food Controller. The maximum price prescribed for a cut shall apply only to the sale of a portion of the fish not exceeding half of the whole fish and not including any part of the head. The&apos;prices of all classes of fish are given in the schedule attached to the Order.(3) The Margarine (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated January .17, 1918, provides that all margarine manufactured, held, or imported after January 26th, shall, be placed at the disposal of the Food Controller and delivered to him or to his order. The effect of this Order,,is to. give the Food Controller power to control in every particular the. distribution of. margarine, and a scheme to render this effective- is approaching com-pletion; the earlier processes in the manufacture of margarine are already fully controlled.   :&apos;, ... ::     ; (4) The Rum and Gi,n ^Restriction of Sales) Order, .1918, dated January 17, r-*     1918, prohibits sales by auction of rum and gin&apos;on the lines &quot;already ...&quot;      V    .adopted in the Whisky (Restriction on Sales) Ore]or with reference t6 that liquor.(5.) The Raw Coma (Returns)- Order ^ 191.8, dated 19 January, 1918, requires returns of all raw cocoa held in bond at the close of business on January 22nd in the United Kingdom whether on home or foreign account.   The returns have to be- made by February 2nd.(6) The Cattle Feeding Stuffs (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated 21 January, 1918, has the effect of requisitioning all cattle feeding cakes and meals, millers&apos; offals, barley and oat offals, malt culms, kiln dust, and brewers&apos;k   (33)4763-4   Pk 1   100   1/18   E&amp;s a
and distillers&apos; grains that were in the United Kingdom on January 22nd, or are imported, made or produced on and after that day, with exception of those in the possession of farmers or other consumers. The chief object of this Order is to obtain better control over,, the distribution of these feeding stuffs, to release held-up slocks, and to secure the forwarding of larger and more regular supplies, particularly to districts where supplies are required for dairy cattle.(7) The Public Meals Order, 1918, dated January 22,1918, restricts the amount&apos; of meat, sugar, bread, flour and fats that may be consumed in public hotels, boarding houses, restaurants,  and eating houses, including boarding houses and unlicensed hotels in which the number of bed-rooms available for letting exceeds five. Beginning with Friday next, two meatless days a week are instituted, on which no meat, poultry or game may be served or consumed in any public eating place. The meatless days for the City of London and the Metropolitan Police District are Tuesdays and Fridays, and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, Wednesdays and Fridays.   Between the hours of 5 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. no meat, poultry, or game may be served or consumed on any day.   No milk may be served or consumed as a beverage, or as part of a beverage, except with tea, coffee, cocoa, or chocolate as usually served, but it may be given to children under 10 years of age.As sugar is only permitted for cooking purposes, guests will have to provide their own means of sweetening beverages.The permitted quantities of meat, flour, bread and sugar, butter, margarine, and other fats must not exceed the gross quantities allowed for the meals served during the week, ascertained in accordance with the following scale of average quantities per meal: 	Meat.	Sugar.	Bread.	Flour.	Butter, Margarine, and other Fats.Breakfast -      -      -      -      -	Nil.&quot;	Nil.	3 oz.

Tea -      -             -      -      -	Nil.	Nil.	1tt oz.	Nil.	j oz.&apos; Powers are given to Food Committees to reduce the total quantities of any of the rationed articles in any public eating houses within their areas, or to limit the quantity of any foodstuffs which may be supplied or used.Public eating places which do not serve meals exceeding Is. 2d. in price, exclusive of beverages, are excluded from certain provisions of the Order, including those as to meatless days; and other public eating places which do not charge more than fid. (including beverages) in respect of meals begun between 3 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. not including meat, fish, or eggs, are also excluded from certain provisions. The Order comes into force on February 3rd, except as regards meatless days, which are. to be enforced from January 25th, onwards.The Public Meals&apos; Order, 1917, with its amendments, is revoked as on 3rd February, 1918.Control of Supplies and Prices.Allied Purchases. Negotiations to provide finance for the additional 35,000 tons of frozen meat and the 150,000,000 pounds of bacon, mentioned in last week&apos;s report, have resulted satisfactorily, and the Treasury have instructed Sir Hardman Lever to authorise these purchases.Mr. Owen Smith cables that contracts for 24,820,000 pounds of frozen beef have been closed in the United States, and for 443,184 pounds in Canada.Mr. Owen Smith cables that everything possible is being done to expedite shipments of bacon and beef, but that the situation is very difficult, as there is considerable delay in securing the necessary railway permits from the United States railway authorities.   He reports that the United States Government are. taking
drastic steps to end the railway congestion, and that future shipments will depend upon the outcome of these measures. Approximately 8,000 tons of ham and bacon loaded;or loading for the United Kingdom are delayed at Atlantic ports owing to shortage of bunker coal.Payments made for food purchases by the British Government Commercial Agency for week ending January 19th amounted to 3,691,487 dollars in the United States, and 1,035,362 dollars in Canada.Bacon, Earns, and Lard. Forms are still being received under the Scheme of Distribution for these commodities which was to come into operation on the 1st February. Owing to the shortage of supplies arriving it is probable that the inception of the scheme will have to be postponed. It is evident that retailers have in many cases made false applications, as the aggregate amount for which application has been made is greatly in excess of the amount obtained in 1916. It is intended to communicate with all Divisional Food Commissioners on the measures to be taken to deal with these mistakes and offences.Returns under the Bacon and Ham Curers (Returns) Order, 1917, have been received from over 700 curers. The returns so far collated show 96,000 tons cured in 1917, of which 78,000 tons were cured by the large and 18,000 tons by the small curers.A Conference with the bacon curers was held on the llth January, followed by Committee meetings with the English and Irish curers. Definite proposals for the control of the trade and the proper allocation of the pig supply were discussed, and resolutions on the subject were adopted.Further progress has been made with the proposed amendment of the Bacon, Ham, and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, and the Costings Department has been consulted on the amount of remuneration to be allowed for the primary and secondary, wholesalers and other matters.Butter and Margarine Distribution. Another issue of butter and margarine is being made this week under the Butter Distribution Scheme, to the amount of 1,200 tons of butter and 1,000 tons of margarine. This is the second distribution this month of one-eighth of the quantity applied for by the trade for January, so that supplies have only amounted to 25 per cent, of requirements.Cocoa. The Advisory Committee met for the first time last week, and were informed of the provisional prices which the Ministry propose for Raw Cocoa. These prices are to be reported on at this week&apos;s meeting of the Committee.The manufacturers have supplied statistics of their costings with a view to fixing the retail prices of cocoa powder and cocoa butter. It is doubtful whether the existing plant is sufficient to produce the amount of cocoa powder required. As the result of an Inter-Departmental Conference, the War Trade Department have decided to prohibit the export of cocoa and butter as from 15th February.Coffee. Returns under the Coffee (Returns) Order are now complete, and are being checked and tabulated. The Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee has been formed to investigate these returns, and to make recommendations on the subject of coffee held in bond for foreign account.Several complaints have been received from retailers of their inability to purchase coffee which can be retailed profitably at Is. Qd. per lb. Investigation of most of these cases has shown that the wholesalers are quite prepared to sell reasonable quantities of coffee which cau be profitably retailed at Is. 6d. per lb., but it is thought probable that in the near future it will be necessary to fix a maximum wholesale price for the cheaper grades of coffee.Dried Fruits.-Instructions have been sent to the Ministry&apos;s representatives in Greece informing them that their services will not be required after January 17th, and ordering their return to England. Mr. Burlumi remains in Greece at present, to supervise the transport of currants already purchased; he is inspecting the s.s. &quot;Rooke,&quot; now discharging cargo at Piraeus, with a view to determining her suitability for lifting currants. The Shipping Branch report that it is expected that the Taranto route will be available for the transport of currants in a short time.The s.s. &quot; Cornfield&quot; has arrived, with 1,500 tons of currants, and is being discharged in the London Docks. .Instructions have been sent to Government buyers in Spain, America and Portugal ordering their withdrawal.
Meat: The meat shortage is still&apos;acute, but all possible steps are being taken to control distribution, and to increase the available supplies in the markets of both home-killed and imported meat. The situation is gradually improving, and considerable alleviation is hoped for before long.Miscellaneous Foods. Estimates of the annual consumption of stocks of salt, pepper, mustard, nutmegs, &amp;c, at present in the United Kingdom, have been prepared, in order that a decision may be made as to the policy to be adopted in regard to exports of these commodities.Oils and Fats.-Arrivals of oils and fats during November 1917 were 70,661 tons, and in December 1917 67,946 tons, while the monthly requirement is 115,^67 tons. It is, therefore, very necessary to increase the imports of oils and oil seeds as far as possible. It is hoped that the necessary financial arrangements for obtaining the maximum supply of linseed from the Argentine will be completed in a few days, and freight room has been obtained for 3,000 tons of Premier Jus and Oleo oil from South America ; arrangements are now being made to ship this quantity, which, added to the shipments coming forward from North America, will considerably augment the supplies of margarine.Last week the amount of home-produced margarine reached the record output of 4,500 tons. This week machinery will be set up with a capacity for the output of 300 tons, and at the end of the month further plant will be ready for another 400 tons output. It is hoped that a record total of 5,000 tons output will be reached early in February.The United Kingdom Linseed Oil Consumers&apos; Association has been formed for the purpose of allocating supplies to consumers. The Association will be guided in allocating supplies in every case by considerations of war priority.In this action it should be noted that a process has been discovered for using linseed oil fatty acids, instead of the oil itself, in the production of linoleum.Sugar. There have been no further losses of sugar cargoes. The shortage of tonnage continues and is becoming a serious menace to the maintenance of regular supplies of raw sugar to the refineries, which before long will have to close down for some weeks.Tea. It has been decided that National Control tea shall be retailed at the flat rate of 2s. Sd. per lb. A certain amount of time will be allowed during which retailers may dispose of their higher priced tea bought under the 90 per cent, control scheme. The time allowed will probably be four weeks in England and six weeks in Scotland and Ireland.The proportion of tea available for distribution during January, 1918, to the amount in the datum period, has been fixed at 70 per cent., but it is anticipated that February ballots of National Control tea will show an improvement on this figure.A Deputation from the Netherland Indies Committee has been received to discuss the importation of Java tea, and this matter is now under consideration.Transport and Cold Storage. An executive officer has been appointed to supervise all the London Docks, with the duty of detecting and, where possible, preventing wastage of food stuffs, both during the process of discharging from vessels and whilst held in warehouse or craft. It is also the duty of this officer to provide for the salvage of any damaged goods or their utilisation, to the best advantage, in order to eliminate any avoidable loss.Local Authorities.Administration. Protests that labour is insufficiently represented on Food Control Committees have been received in increasing numbers lately. It is hoped that the announcement made by Lord Rhondda in respect of his policy as to increased representation will.allay a certain amount of the discontent which has arisen.This announcement of policy is being circulated to all Food Commissioners to guide them as to the attitude that they should adopt in dealing with the question of representation of labour in the future.Distribution.Reports show that during the last ten days local shortages have become more numerous and acute, and have been much more difficult to meet than formerly.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.The aggregate weight of imports of principal foods fell last week to the very low level of 70,000 tons (Table A). In 1916 and 1917 the weekly average imports for the same group cf foods were 236,000 tons and 208,000 tons respectively, and it is estimated that at least 210,000 tons weekly during the first eight months of 1918A  4763-1 &apos; ^It is reported that no bacon will be available for civilian consumption for at least a month, while cheese will amount to only 50 per cent, of the normal quantity. The position with regard to meat supply is more serious than in the previous week.In view of a complaint by Col. Percy Williams, M.P., to the effect that there was serious trouble pending at Middlesbrough, owing to food shortage, especially of margarine, arrangements were made to send additional supplies, and Colonel Williams has since expressed his satisfaction at the steps taken.A scheme of rationing has been drawn up in outline for adoption in London and the Home Counties, and it appears that practically the whole of that area is prepared to accept it. At present provision is made only for the rationing of butter and margarine, but there is a strong feeling in favour of including meat, and the arrange-ments that would be required for this purpose are now under consideration.In the Provinces further progress has been made in grouping areas for the purpose of adopting combined schemes, amongst which may be mentioned (1) The Scottish scheme which will cover the entire industrial area of Scotland with Glasgow and Edinburgh as centres.(2) The South Midland scheme comprising Oxfordshire, Southampton, Wilts and Bucks with Portsmouth, Southampton, and Reading as main centres.(3) A South Welsh scheme with Cardiff and Swansea as centres.At Bradford, Leeds, Manchester, Burnley, Huddersfield, Halifax, and other places, grouping schemes are being developed and it may now be said that schemes are either in operation or in rapid preparation for all the large Industrial Centres in Great Britain.Enforcement.Tho following cases are of interest: At Tower Bridge Police Court, Adam Gates, of Bermondsey, was fined 251. and 4L 4s. costs for making a false statement in an application for com-pensation under the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order.At Pontypool Petty Sessions the Abersychan and Talywain Co-operative Society was fined 301. and 151. 15s. costs for refusing to supply articles of food unless a sugar card has been deposited.Five summonses were served on Oscar Harner, at Coventry, on Saturday for hoarding the following articles of food :  400 lbs. of tea. 141 lbs. of sugar. 37 tins of sardines. 131 lbs. of butter. 14 hams.The defendant was convicted in each case and fined 5001. and 50Z. costs. He was also sentenced to one month&apos;s imprisonment. The goods found were ordered to be confiscated.For a similar offence Mrs. Jessie Klaber, of Shortlands, was fined 50L and 10L 10s. costs.Fredk. Coope, provision dealer, was fined 25L, including costs, at Cannock on January 17th for selling butter above the maximum price.At Porterdawe Police Court, on llth instant, Joseph Burton &amp; Co., Nottingham, were fined 20Z. and hi. costs for selling 1 lb. of margarine at a price above the maximum price.At Kidderminster, on January llth, Joseph Minett was fined 25L and costs for selling lard above the maximum price. His plea was that he had melted the lard and added rosemary to it, and thought he could chargeper lb. profit instead of 2d.
- r6should: be imported to -preserve the standard of: food of 1916 arid fi Dish the cereal year with an adequate stock&quot;. &quot; In the&apos;first three weeks of this year the average has been only 117,000 tons! \ &quot; [ &apos;  ;; \J ../      ... &apos;..;..Table A shows that the decrease since-last&apos; week is in. imports of wheat, beef, sugar, and rice,: The stock of: rice is good, and a temporary deficiency of imports is not serious&apos;;-as- compared with last year the stock of&apos;sugar is fair. The stock of wheat is rapidly being reduced to the level of last year, while the shortage&quot; of beef is well known.Of tea, 3,555 tons were received, and the position is slowly improving.Consumption.Meat. The supply of home-fed meat at four principal markets (Table B) in the week ended January 12th was 10 per cent, better than in the previous week, but only equalled two-thirds of the supply in the corresponding week last year.At the Central Market, London, the supply of home-fed meat has been as follows: 1917. 1918. Tons. Tons.Week ending January 5th - - - 2,883 .- 1,784 ,. 12th- - - 3,176 2.233 ,,   19th-     -     -  2,762        1,974At 59 markets in Great Britain there was in the week January 10th-16th an increase of 713 cattle and a decrease of 64,160 sheep as compared with the previous week (Table C). The supplies of cattle and sheep were only&apos; 32 per cent, and 65 per cent, respectively of the supplies in the corresponding week last year. It will be remembered that in the week January 3rd-9th this year an abnormal number of sheep were brought to market; in fact, the supply of sheep in the fortnight ending January 16th was 10 per cent, greater than last year. It remains to be seen whether the fall in the sheep supply is of a permanent character.As a result of recent regulations the supplies of cattle and sheep brought to market, tend to become a larger proportion of the total brought into consumption; consequently, the actual deficiency for the whole population is even greater than that shown in the table.The supply of foreign meat (Table B) was greater in the week ending January 12th than in recent weeks, hut only 59 per cent, of the supply last year. In London the supply fell again in the week January 14th-20th, and was only 41 per cent, of last year&apos;s.Bread and Flour. The use of potatoes in the manufacture of bread is shown by the bakers&apos; returns from December 9th to January 5th, summarized last week, to have commenced, but only on a trifling scale. 72,000 tons of cereal flour was made into bread, &amp;c, by the bakers making returns ; 92 per cent, of the bakers used no potatoes ; the remaining 8 per cent, used 172 tons.The usual returns &quot;were received from all the principal biscuit manufacturers. There is considerable diminution in the consumption of flour as compared with the previous month owing to the influence of Christmas, but an increase as compared with December, 1916.Consumption of Flour by the Principal Biscuit Manufacturers.^Four Weeks ended.

fProvisions. Returns from Multiple Shops and. Co-operative Societies, as to sales in the four weeks ending December 22nd are now complete, and the resulting index-numbers are.shown in Table E. As much butter and more margarine was sold than in the previous four weeks; probably, if we could include also sales by individual traders a different result would have been found. In the case of every commodity included, except lard, the sales by Co-operative Societies fell relatively to those by; Multiple Shops.   The following table summarises the returns.Sales in Four W 3eks ended	December 23rd, 1916.	November 24th, 1917.	December 22nd, 1917.Butter and margarine :	Tons.	Tons.
