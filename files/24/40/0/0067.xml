TUs Document Is theProperty ofColoud Jones&quot;is Britannic MajSECRET *Intelligence Bureau,267Weekly Report on Auetria*Hungary.   XXV* (26th January, 1918.)Department of Information. BAW/025.The troubles in Austria, of which the press has been full this week, are the natural and inevitable result of the political and economic decay and desorientation both in Austria and in Hungary, with whioh these reports have had to deal for many months past.    The situation is unquestionably grave, but it would be most unwise to draw too far-reaching deductions from it, or to suppose that we are necessarily on the eve of a revolution in Austria.    The most that can safely be said is that the situation has now reached a* stage of complication and acuteness at whichno human being can hope to gauge the future and at which starring and unexpected events may occur at any moment, or on the other hand may be postponed very much longer than would seem provable.The essential point to consider is that so far as the inV formation as yet available goes the movement comes from German working classes of Austria and centres in Vienna and the industrial and munition towns of Lower Austria (the province in which Vienna is situated).     It has nothing to do with the various national movements among the other races.    To describe it, or indeed any movement, in Austria as &quot;Austrianor indeed to speak of an &quot;Austrian nation&quot; (as a prominent English newspaper did recently) is a contradiction in terms.     In Austria there are nations, but no nation, and even Social Democracy is subject to the universal racial cleavage.    There has been a parallel sympathetic movement in Budapest, on no less definitely proletarian lines: but in the absence of detailed news it is safe to assume that this did nott
extend to the provinces in Hungary since, owing to the peculiar gooial and geographical conditions of Hungary, the capital is practically the only place where the working classes count at all, and this not by reason of their political influence (since they are unrepresented both in Parliament and in the Town Council), but by their persistent social organisation and skill in demonstrations, meetings, etc. in the teeth of a hostile system.There is an obvious parallel between the present political situation in Austria and that of 1906*7, when the power of the working classes revealed itself for the first time in the monster demonstrations for universal suffrage.    Then as now the spark which lit the flame came from Russia: the effect of the Russian revolution of 1905 upon political feeling among the masses in Austria was immediate and ve%y marked.     Indeed it is true to say - and this is a vital factor in the Rueopean situation - that political forces in Russia and Austria-Hungary flow into each other as some mysterious, uncontrollable, magnetic current.    But in all details the situation is radically different and far less favourable to the authorities in theDual Monarchy than it was ten years ago.     In those days it was the Crown which on its own initiative (of course for a definite political purpose) took up the democratic ideas which came from Russia and launohed the programme of franchise reform.    While the ruling class in Hungary has ever since oontrived to evade the pledges of reform given to the Crown, the ruling class in Austria was wiser and more conciliatory, with the result that universal suffrage waB carried into law without the opposition and with the positive help of the bureaucracy, and for the time the prestige of the Powers that Be was positively enhanced.    Events, it is true, have not ful* filled the promise of those days, and the nsw wave of democracy is breaking against a system which has become thoroughly dis-credited in the interval.     The present holder of the Crov-n is
popular as a man, &quot;but is entirely lacking in the vast experience and prestige which his predecessor had accumulated and utterly powerless to control the situation in a country where that task hah  hitherto lain with the Crown.    The suspension of the constitution during the earlier years of the war revealed the impotence of Parliament-ary institutions in Austria and incidentally forced the non-German races into adopting more and more uncompromising national programmes The war has made a gulf of blood and horror between the various races.    The bureaucracy has proved unequal to the strain of a very terrible economic situation.    The national feuds have steadily undermined the spirit of the army and spread disaffection everywhere.This contrast   helps to explain the present situation! in whioh the Government had little or no prestige or authority to fall back upon, and therefore suddenly capitulated to a movement from below.    The causes of the upheaval seem to have been almost equally political and economic.    Por months past, as previous reports have shown, there has been a gradual deterioration of the food supply.of distribution and of * communications: and the un-usually severe weather of the last month (tremendous snow-falls and consequent break-down of the traffic) seems to have brought matters almost to the breaking-point.    The lack of fuel, lighting, foodead clothing has produced acute and universal misery, and caused public opinion to cling desperately to the hope of peace presented by the Brest-Lit ovsk negotiations.    Not unnaturally the authorities, with the help of the Censor, did everything.to en-courage these feelings and to divert public feeling from present miseries to the &quot;bright light shining from the Sastrt.    There is indeed a grim humour in watching the comments of the official press on the Russian revolutionaries - those kindred spirits Trotski and Czerninl - and the discreet veil drawn over such uncomfortable incidents as the murder of General Duhonin by his mutinous soldiery.
4 .270When, then, almost at the same time, it was announced that the flour ration was to be reduced by half throughout Austria, and it became known that the hitherto fairly Bmooth course of the Brest negotiations was being threatened by general Hoffmann^ Babre-rattling speech, the cup of popular feeling seems suddenly to have overflowed.     The strike movement began at Wiener Neustadt, and swiftly spread to Vienna and various munition centres in Lower Austria.    We have the public admission of the official leader of the German-Austrian Socialists, Dr. Viktor Adler, that the movement was not initiated by the party leaders.     &quot;Without any warning or signal from the Social Democrats,&quot; he mid, &quot;the idea has suddenly sprung up among ths masses that if this hope (i.e. Brest) vanishes, and there is nothing to eat, we have nothing else to lose.&quot;    The reports which have hitherto reached this country are of course very inadequate and have, it must be remembered, for the most part passed through Germany a&amp;fr Amsterdam and therefore represent what Germany is content that tie Entente should know.    But it corresponds to the nature of things that the Socialist leaders Adler, Renner, Seitz, etc. should be genuinely endeavouring to exercise a moderating influenoe upon the masses. These men have done an immense deal for working class progress in Austria and&apos;enjoy the esteem and confidence of the Socialist masses. But they are too deeply imbued with the pure Marxian evolutionary doctrines to be the right men for riding the whirlwind: and it is already evident that their great influence is likely to be strained to the uttermost in order to keep the movement within bounds.The attitude of the Government reveals signs of much greater weakness than might have been expedted even from its previous record.    The Premier   and three of hie colleagues received the Socialist leaders in deputation, and after solemn   assurances of the Emperor&apos;s keen desire for peace at the earliest possible moment and of the Monarchy-s resolve to respect the independence of Poland, proceeded to commit the Government to extremely
- 5 *important concessions in four directions.I.    The Premier -expressed his readiness to keep the popular represent at it ,os informed regarding the course of the peace negotiations.    This is a marked change of attitude: for only a few weeks before, in answer to the insistent demand of the of the Slav deputies in the Riechsrat that a parliamentary con-eultative committee (Beirat) should be allowed to accompany Count Czernin to Brest, he had scouted the bare idea as oontrary to all constitutional practice in all countries, and had shown not the slightest inclination either to consult the party leaders or even to keep them informed as to the course of the negotiations.    His eudden readiness for concession is the more remarkable since there can be no question that on a strict legal interpretation of the Austrian constitution the Crown possesses the right to decide all questions of peace and war without regard for Parliament.2.    The Food Controller made various promises with regard to the distribution of food, which obviously must be more explicit than the short telegraphic summaries indicate, or they could not have produced even relative satisfaction.    Whether the working classes will try to exercise their obvious right to share in the control of food supplies, remains to be seen.     Their success in this direction would of course be a tremendous innovation, whose effect throughout Central Europe might be incalculabfe.-3.     The Minister of the Interior promised the extension of universal suffrage to the municipalities, combined with llP.R.11 and woman-suffrage.    The offer of these concessions is all the more significant, since there has been no serious movement for their attainment.    They therefore suggest something like panic on the part of the authorities.4.     The Minister of Defence in his turn promised the prompt ^-militarisation of industry - i.e, the removal of various ^litary restraints upon industrial and munition workers - and the restriction of the military tribunals, which have raged unchecked for the past three years with such disastrous effects.
inOn the strength of these pledges the socialist leaders recommended a return to work.     But it appears that their advice has only partially been adopted, and that 40 per cent of the workmen Btill remain out on strike.     The most interesting account as yet available, that of the Vossische Zeitung, maintains that the moving spirit in the whole strike has been the little group of Maximalists whose real leader, Eriedrich Adler (son of the veteran &apos;Tiktor), is at present in prison for the murder of the late Premier, Count Stflrgkh.    The most active member of this group is said to be Otto Bauer, who is one of the ablest Socialist theoretical writers in Europe, and a recognised authority on racial questions.    He had been taken   prisoner by the Russians, but was allowed to return home last autumn by permission of the Provisional Government.     Since then there are two quite   conflicting accounts of his activities.     He is alleged to have been definitely employed in the Ballplatz as a specialist on Russian affairs, while on the other hand he is said t be in actual touch with the Russian Bolsheviks.    while reserving our opinion upon Bauer, we may quite safely assume that new forces are seething among %*&amp; German-Austrian proletariat and that new leaders are coming to the front.     The official socialist organ, the Arbeiter Zedtung, has for weeks past been extraordinarily outspoken both on ex-ternal matters, but even it has hinted that it may soon be left far behind by events.The whole movement, it is nsecessary to repeat, is essentially a working-class movement, in w&amp;ich the national element is entirely subordinate.     It originated among the Germans of Austria and at once spread - almost certainly by previous arrangement ** to the Magyar industrial population of Budapest.     It has been followed promptly by a general strike among the Czechs in Prague and other towns: but this is equally certainly a distinct movement, though running on parallel lines and in general sympathy.    The
great difference between the political outlook of the Czechs and the Germans is that among the latter there is a profound and growing cleavage between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat .such as prevents uniform action in national political questions: whereas among the Czechs - as their German enemies are admitting more freely than ever - the middle and working classes, clericals, agrarians and socialists alike - stand absolutely united in their programme of national independence.     Hence it is certain that if the unrest assumes the same dimensions in Bohemia as elsewhere, we shall find national demands coupled with those which deal with food problems and the problem of international peace.So far the Austrian Premier&apos;s attitude towards the Czechs has been as little conciliatory as ever.     On 6th January, the Czech parliamentary Club (representing all Czech parties) held what was virtually a Convention at Prague, at w] ich Dr. Fra,^arz and all the other amnestied leaders   and most other persons of distinc-tion in Czech public life were present: and passed resolutions of a very stiff character, reaffirming the claim of self-determination and Czechoslovak independence-     So drastically did the Censor deal with the report of these proceedings, that even the Minister of the Interior appears to have been scandalised. On January 22nd, when the Reichsrat reopened, the Premier denounced the declarations of this Czech Convention, as signifying an appeal to Revolution  which must be indignantly rejected by every Austrian and resisted by the Government.     It is, he added, dis-approved of by the Crown.    the sitting appears to have been very stormy, various Czech deputies calling on the Premier to resign and describing him as &quot;General Hoffmann the Second&quot;.     Some of the German deputies made a counter-demon strati on by demanding the complete separation of the German distriote of Bohemia.The strike in Budapest was also on a very large scale.     Here too the Premier received a deputation of workmen, but instead of
mjaaicing concessions like his Austrian colleague, he contented him-self with receiving a memorandum containing their various demands. He gave, however, very explicit assurances that the Government would uphold the new Franchise Bill at all costs, and he expressed the Governments eagerness for peace and its complete agreement with Count Czernin*s programme.     Details are still   lacking as to the course of events in Hungary, hut of course the movement is far less dangerous in that stronghold of reaction than in the seething pot of Austria.There hatfe &quot;been suggestions of collusion between the authorities and the Sooialist leaders, inspired by the motive of evading the demands of Berlin that Austro-Hungarian troops should be sent to the Western front.    There is certainly nothing im-possible in this theory: the socialist leaders who ten years ago earned the nickname of &quot;Imperial-Royal SooialistQ* and broke with their?.party traditions to the extent of being present at the address from the Throne, might quite well entertain a pact with the Governmenti on terms.    Dr. Adler is too old a man and has been too hard hit by his son5 e action (Stttrgkh murder) to push for revolution: while his most active lieutenant Renner is really a Socialist more by accident than by nature, and finds his theories of political reform far too acceptable to Austria&apos;s bureauoratic rulers to plunge into unreasoning opposition to them.    But   &apos; collusion is a misleading phrase and can only be supposed to exist in the sense that the official Socialist leaders are willing to exercise a moderating influence on the masses.On the other hand there can be little doubt that the authorities will avoid repression so far as possible, partly out of alarm and partly because the movement provides them with arguments for urging on Berlin the need for prompt peace.     It would be premature to venture any assertion with regard to possible collusion between Cz em in and KHhlmann, but there can be no doubt
whatever that they are united in their opposition to the military party in Germany and its extreme demands.Speaking generally, tne situation of the Dual Monarchy is certainly one of extreme gravity, and we may be approaching the period predicted by more than one competent observer, when the certainty that a gap of some weeks will open up before the next harvest, can no longer be concealed from the population.     Czernin may talk bravely about strikes merely injuring the families of the strikers and the need of patience until a food   agreement can be reached with the Ukraine.    But his words are, even on the most favourable interpretation, only intended to conceal the fact that the Entente can afford to Wait, While Austria-Hungary cannot.Meanwhile, if there are signs of new and hitherto scarcely suspected movements among the working  masses in Austria-Hungary, disintegration is proceeding steadily in the Army.     One side of this process is represented by the national disaffection of the Slavs - above all, the Czechs: the other, by widespread exhaustion and declining discipline in the ranks.     Por a competent observer (just returned from Kiev), who has every incentive to find out the facts and special facilities for doing bo, we learn that cases of desertion both at and behind the Austro-Hungarian front are growing in frequency, that slackness has increased, that officers hesitate to impose punishments, that expkits of the Kfipenick variety are more and more common (soldiers masquerading as officers for months at.a time, etc.). Clearly Bolshevist doctrine is spreading and finds especially fertile soil in Galicia and Hungary, where the dominant factors are the land-hunger of the peasantry and the racial and political domination of the landlord class.To sum up, the movement is probably only reaching the first rapids, not the final cataract.     The most that can be said for the moment is that conditions are so grave that anything
26.1* 13 *may happen.     Happily the Entente is now in a position to await events, and must not make the mistake of the prentice who opened the furnace doors too soon.    The process is in operation in Austria, and any interference might do more harm than good.
