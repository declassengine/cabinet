Colonel Jones(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)iM   boms.Mr. JKellaway has asked me to circulate the following memorandum1 written in reply to the paper (G.T. 3454) from the Committee p\n Production.(SGD..) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.30.1.18.The Committee on Production hayo addressed to the War Cabinet a protest against a letter I recently sent to my constituency on the 12%/o bonus..    The Committee^ protest is based on the assumption that I justified the 12j$ bonus solely on the ground of the increased cost of living.    They endeavour to justify this contention by quotations from parts of two different sentences in a long letter.For the convenience of members of the War Cabinet, I give in parallel columns the quotations made by the Committee on Production and the actual sentences as they appeared in, my letter.
Sentence as. quoted by the Committee on Iroductifln.&apos;(l)   &quot;the wages of the majority of munition workers, oven with IZJfii added, have not done more than keep pace with the increase in the cost of living&quot;.Sentence as it a^eared in .ithej letter.fl)   &quot;the bread fact, I believe to be, that the wages      munition v/orkers, even with 12^ added, have not dene more than keep pace with the increase in the coat of living, and the extra enorffy which they have to throw into their wcrk&quot;.(l) in consequence of the bonus&quot;the reasonable demands of the munition workers for a remuneration adequate to their efforts and to the cost of living have been met by the Government&quot;.(2)   &quot;the reasonable demands of the munition workers for a remuneration adequate to their efforts and to the cost of living have been met by tho Government, not as a result of pressure, but in an honest- attempt to redress an undoubted&quot; grievance&quot;.It will be seen that the words v/hich the Committee omitted from the first paragraph show that I did not state that the 12-fe^ was given solely on the ground of tho increased cost of living.    V.rhat I said v/as that in addition to the cost of living the Government had to take into account the special efforts v/hich munition workers have been called upon to put forth during the war.-The Committee^ omission from tho second sentence is as bad.     To anyone reading the sentence as a v/hole it would be clear that I was referring to the skilled man&apos;s grievance.My letter attempted to pjpint out what in my view had been overlooked in the controversy, that the/
the real origin of the 12j$ bonus was to bo found in the peaceful industrial revolution which had boon accomplished by tho abolition of the Leaving Certifieato system.F. ZBLL4.WAY
