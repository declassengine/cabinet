SECRET. Copy No.j .....     -..........No.O.L/144/412.The Secretary,War Cabinet.I attach a report on the American Army received from French sources.     As the War Cabinet is aware, an American Division comprises 27,000 effectives, and is very strong in artillery and machine guns.      For1 purposes of calculation it may be taken that 2 American Divisions equal 3 British or French Divisions.(Sd.)   W. KIRKE.Col. G.S. for C.I.G.S.War Office,27th January 1918
VERY CONFIDENTIAL.2S3E.L.S. 2075.NOTE FOR COLONEL FAGALDETRANSLATION.NOTEby the French General Staff on American Military Assistance in 1918.1, -   SITUATION OF THE AMERICAN ARMY IN FRANCE ON JANUARY 1st.:x:On January 1st the combatant units of the American Expeditionary Force In Franoe comprised:a) - 4 Divisions (incompletely trained),b) - 1 Coast Artillery Brigade (personnel only).Total     ......     ...     100,000 combatants.The following is the situation of each of the 4 Divisions above referred to:1st DIVISION.     The units of this Division spent a few days inthe front line during December. The Divisional Instruction of the Division is now complete, and it took over a sector on January 15th.26th DIVISION.   The Infantry and Artillery of this Division arecompleting their Infantry and Artillery training respectively; the four Infantry regiments are toput.....:x: ..,Apart from combatant units the American Army in France comprises about 60,000 men of technical units (railway and air service) and of various non-combatant formations. Besides these, the 41st (Depot) Division may be considered as having completed disembarkation on January 20th.
put into line during the early part of February, one regiment to each Division of the 11th French Army Corps.   The 26th Division will then be reconcentrated for a short period for Divisional instruction, and will j then take its place by the side of the 1st Division. It will probably take over a sector about April 1st.42nd DIVISION.     The Infantry and Artillery of this Division arecarrying out Infantry and Artillery training.   When this training is completed (about the beginning of March) they will be put into line on the same principle as the 26th Division and subsequently carry out Divisional training in the same manner.   It will probably take over a sector about May 1st (?).2nd DIVISION.      The Infantry and Artillery of this Division are nowbeing concentrated, and will shortly begin Infantry and Artillery training; it will pass through the same stages as the 26th and 42nd Divisions and will probably take over a sector about June 1st (?).II.-       PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN MILITARY ASSISTANCE.The number of American Divisions which will be in a position to participate in offensive action by various dates in the year 1918 can only be estimated on the bases of hypotheses as regards the rapidity with which the American Army will be trained and transported to France during the coming Spring and Summer.The experience of the last 8 months, however, permits of these hypotheses being established on bases which are at leastprobable, if not absolutely certain.From what is known of the American effort, it can be anticipated :-1.- That during the year 1918 the number of American troops transported will hardly average more than 2 Divisions a month.2,-   That the American Divisions transported during the 1st 6 months of 1918 will arrive in France without having more than begun company etc. training.3,-   That these Divisions will require at least 6 months for Infantry etc. trainingj   Divisional training and holding quiet sectors before they are fit to take part in a general offensive operation.(These
(These hypotheses are rather favourable than not,     As a matter of faot:-1,-        In the last 5 months 150,000 men have been transported to Prance from America, or an average of 30,000 men per month (1 strong American Division)..     The transportation of 2 Divisions a month, taking into consideration the tonnage required to supply these over-increasing effectives, demands that the tonnage set aside for military transportation should be immediately doubled, and in 10 months from now triple the tonnage now employed for these purposes.2.-        Training in the United States is at present hardlyorganised.    The Infantry are still engaged on individual training, and the training of the Artillery has practically not begun,3,-        The experience of British Divisions proves that 6 months Divisional training and holding quiet sectors is only just enough to break in the officers and staffs      large units to cope with the difficulties of modern warfare; a fortiori^ the barely organised American Divisions which are expected in Prance during the first 3 months of 1918 will require 6 months war training,)A.- The number of American Divisions in France: On the 1st March will be     ...     *.,     8 On the 1st June     ,,. .* *     * *i   14On the 1st September ... 20On the 1st January, 1919     M(     ...   28On the other hand,: an American Army Corps consists of 6 Divisions, of which 4 are fighting Divisions, and 2 Depot Divisions,    From these data the number of American fighting Divisions in Prance on the various dates above mentioned may be estimated (See Ghart attached)B,- It must be assumed that the only Divisions capable of taking part In an offensive will be the fighting Divisions which have completed their training, i,e, which have spent at least 6 months under training in France and in quiet sectors (See Chart).CONCLUSION
(j o UThe American offensive force at the disposal of the Entente during the Summer of 1918 will only comprise a few Divisions, (4 in July and 8 in October).Apart from these completely trained Divisions it will, of course, be possible to utilise a certain number of Divisions (about 4 at any one time) which are only half trained and have had. no instruction in warfare, to hold quiet sectors.The French Commander-in-Chief bases his plan of operations en the decisive co-operation of the American Army in 1919.     On the 1st May, 1919, the Entente will only have available 16 fully-trained American Divisions, and 4 or 5 Divisions capable of holding a quiet sector; so that by that date the American Army will only constitute a comparatively weak asset - and consequently will not be in a position to undertake and carry out offensive action on a large scale.The American Army cannot be considered as constituting the newfactor capable of obtaining a final decision in the year 1919, unlessvery great efforts are made in the near future:(1) To increase transportation from America to France, and(2) To secure that training in the United States and in France shall produce the maximum possible effect.CONCLUSION.
