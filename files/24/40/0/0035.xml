Colonel JonesT.iIs document is the property of His Britannic majesty.&apos;s Government.Memorandum&apos; 1)7/ tho IvUnister of Reconstruction.I desire to express my approval of the memorandum by the President of the Hoard of Trade (G,T.3396) on the control of road transport provided that it is strictly limited to War Sewr-ws during the period of the war.  I desire to make it clear that in my view the post-bellum arrangements as regards transport should in no degree be prejudiced by any decision arrived at now for putting into force the proposals of the Eoard of Trade.    &quot;Li any case in view of the important transport questions arising in connection with reconstruction,   I think that this Ministry should be represented on the proposed Board both for the purposes of making its experience available for the work of this Ministry and for bringing possible post-war developments before the Eoard so far as may be required.SECRET.ft. T.3435.CONTROL OF ROAD TRANSPORT.C ADDISON.24.1.10.
