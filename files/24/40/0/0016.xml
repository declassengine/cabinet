No. O.A.D. 752. SECRET.General Headquarters.British. Army in the Field.ft20th January, 1918.The Chief of theImperial General Staff.iCopy With reference to Sir Herbert PlumerTs telegram Np, 0.191attached.of 19th instant, stating that he has arranged to take over more front &quot;now that any offensive on a large scale on the part of the enemy in the mountains appears improbable&quot; I trust that careful and immediate consideration may be given to the advisability of at once reinforcing this front from &apos;   Italy.&apos;  According to my information Germany has now not less than 168 divisions on the Franco-Belgian front and may have as many as 179 including 3 from Italy,   In my opinion conditions point to heavy attacks by the enemy on this front, probably as soon as the weather permits; and if it be true that he has withdrawn, or is withdrawing, troops from Italy, it is significant of his strategical views and intentions.I understand from General Petain that the French contemplate an early withdrawal of part of their force from Italy, to the extent.of two or possibly more divisions.As you are aware the disturbing influence of the reorganisation of my divisions, as recently ordered, is a factor of some Importance in the general situation.The great difficulty found in meeting railway require-ments in this theatre in addition to requirements in Italy is a further factor of high importance; and even that consideration alone renders it very necessary that the number of French and British troops in Italy should be kept as low as circumstances will admit of.(Signed)   D, HAIG.Field-Marshal, C ommanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France,
