Colonel Jones,       .  &quot; TIMBER JOMlSML 265The supply of timber to Dublin and the North of Ireland-g^s presenting great difficulty.In Dublin schemes for rebuilding part of the destroyedarea and for additional housing, are either in progress orsanctioned, although after negotiation with the Timber SupplyDepartment the programme has to a large extent been post-poned.   The reduced programme will require about 2,350standards (one standard - 155 cubic feet).    Strong repres-entations have been made to the Timber Supply Department bythe Dublin Chamber-of-Commarce, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, andthe Chief Secretary for Ireland. .A representative of the Timber Supply Department,wasspecially sent to Ireland to go into the matter, and theposition in Dublin now is as follows:-.Already supplied............... 400 standardsArranged for in nativetimber.................... 400 standardsAvailable in imported timbernow in stock and to arrive     500 standardsDeficit...................,... .1050 standards.In the North of Ireland there is a great shortage of timber for industrial purposes, and strong representations have been made by the Belfast Clismber-of-Commerce. Important housing schemes for additional labour in connection with shipbuilding will also require timber.&quot;-Although native timber is being used to a large extent wherever possible, the Controller of  Timber Supplies is satisfied that the quantltiy of suitable timber available whether imported or home- grovm is unlikely to be sufficient unless special action be taken.In the opinion of the Controller of Timber, in order to meet these demands it is necessary to allot tonnage
space, for the importation from St,John!s, Halifax, or the St-Lawrence, of a further 2,000 standards of timber, (1,000 standards to Dublin, and 1,000 to Belfast). The Belfast quantity would be shared with other centres, such as, Londonderry and Larne.   It is proposed that the ship or ships should be allotted to the Timber Supply Department at the usual rates, and that the timber should be imported by the Department and transferred to the merchants in proportions already agreed.In the case of Dublin, the transfer to the merchants, would be on the definite understanding that the timber was reserved for the rebuilding and housing schemes of the Corporation, who, on their part, would arrange to ta^e delivery promptly.Application has been made to the Ministry of Shipping for the necessary ship room, but that Department states that the sanction of the War Cabinet will be neces-sary.As already indicated, the Chief Secretary for Ireland is interested in this matter, and it is understood that a communication to the War Cabinet is being made by him on the subject.A.
