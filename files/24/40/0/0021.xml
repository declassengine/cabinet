SECRET.I CIRCULATE a memorandum drawn up by an Interdepartmental Committee which meets daily at this office on the subject of Russian affairs.It will be observed that it raises in a very specific form the question of * Japanese intervention in Russia. We have always hestitated to encourage this, on the ground that Japanese policy and the memories of the Russo-Japanese war would make any armed intervention by Japanese troops on Russian territory peculiarly offensive to Russian susceptibilities. There is also the suspicion prevalent in some quarters that, if Japan once entered Eastern Siberia, she would endeavour to hold it x permanently.. I think that the Americans hold this view rather strongly, and, while they are themselves most reluctant to embark on any Siberian enterprise, they would entertain the strongest objection to the Japanese acting without them.I will not, in this introductory note, offer any opinion upon the practicability of the scheme; but, as it has been devised by important members of the War Office and the Foreign Office, it deserves, I think, the careful consideration of my colleagues.A. J. B.Foreign Of/ice,January 19. 1918.
v[fhis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1918.SECRET.NOTE BY THE RUSSIA COMMITTEE ON THE QUESTION OF THETRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY.AMONG the questions of policy there is none that calls for an earlier settle-ment of principle, or that involves more important issues, than that or biberia. The economic potentialities of Siberia are enormous, its exploitation has only just begun, and its commercial interest alone warrants us and our Allies doing all we can to prevent its becoming a German preserve. There is also the less wide but more immediate consideration that at present Siberia constitutes our only possible link with Southern and South-Eastern Russia. It is therefore of - the first importance for us to consider the possibilities of acquiring and retaining control in Siberia.The country is curiously constituted, in that, except for a few months in the summer, it has in reality only one door, or rather a double door, at Vladivostock and Dalny. Further, control of the Trans-Siberian Railway at Tcheliabinsk and even more at Samara, cuts Siberia off from European Russia. In short, the Power that holds the Trans-Siberian Railway holds Siberia. Its length is enormous, from Vladivostock to Tcheliabinsk is about 4,000 miles, and perhaps another 400 on to Samara. This would normally require a very large force to hold it, but in actual fact the military operation would be small compared to the immense length of line to be held. Neither from the NoTth nor from&apos; the South are there large forces that could be brought to bear upon the line. The country through which it runs is sparsely populated, and the inhabitants on the whole, apa.rt from the present accidental population of German prisoners, are not likely to indulge in designs against the railway. Still the operation is in itself a big one, and one that could not prudently be undertaken without some assurance of the goodwill of the generality of the inhabitants. The line is very vulnerable, especially about Lake Baikal, and where it crosses the great rivers, such as the Yenesei, so that many guards would be needed, and bridges, tunnels, and stations would all require &apos; effective guards, especially as there are probably a good many Bolsheviks in the country both among the townsfolk and among the political prisoners and their descendants. None the less the operation should not be beyond the power oL the Allies, if they act at once, and they should be able to make themselves master of s Siberia. But if they delay, if they allow the forces of Bolshevism, which are at present not in the ascendancy in Siberia, to acquire definitely the upper hand, and they make no effort to check German penetration from the outset, they will be faced with a far more serious military problem, one indeed that may well be beyond their power. And it must be remembered that if our efforts in Southern Russia, supposing they are so far successful as to set the anti-Bolshevik elements on their feet, are to have any stability and to give any permanent result for our expenditure, we-must have the Trans-Siberian Railway in our hands, for by no other means can we keep the necessary supply of material and munitions going. In the opinion of the Committee it should be a fundamental point of our Russian policy to endeavour to secure the control of Siberia for the Allies.It may be of interest to quote here a passage from a semi-official letter, written by General Knox in Petrogracl on the 16th December, and received after this paper was drafted.  General Knox talking of General Kaledin and his Cossacks says: &apos;&quot; I think he can be made of use to us to oppose complete German exploita-tion of the country. I have said that I think the Germans will get very little supplies out of Russia for about six months after peace, and this is the opinion of nearly all the Russians I have been able to ask. But if the war is going? on till after the next harvest Germany will get everything she wants [186]
2from Russia, unless we support our friends in the country. -Such support will . have to be real. Our Embassies would have to be.recalled from Petrograd, and American and Japanese troops will have to be pushed along the Siberian Railway. If we took &quot;decisive steps like this there would really be very little opposition. Once it was known that we were helping the South-Eastern Alliance, the Rada would come to terms with them and the two together would very soon starve out Northern Russia by shutting off grain and coal and oil. In this way we would once more get a solid Russia anti-German. ^ I&apos; simply ,won&apos;t believe that the Japanese have not their price, and that they would not send three or four divisions for certain compensation in the Far East. American troops should come with them.&quot;On this assumption the practical question arises of how this is to be carried - out. There are two stages. We might content ourselves with holding Vladivostock and guarding our huge accumulation Of stores there, and with maintaining the Chinese control at Harbin, thereby definitely keeping the door into Siberia in our hands, and then wait for clearer indications as to the future of Russia. (Control at Vladivostock and Harbin would probably be sufficient for this purpose, as, although the accounts are conflicting, the balance of our information tends to show that we need not fear the removal of the stores by the Amur Railway, especially as Chita, just beyond where it joins the Trans-Siberian line, is reported to be a Cossack stronghold. See Sir J. Jordan&apos;s telegram No. 28.) The advantage of this policy is that it does not risk combining Russian opinion against us, and we have a good case against any Bolshevik attempt in Petrograd to accuse us of direct opposition to the Government of Russia. But it does not enable us to feed Southern Russia, it is merely a half measure, and though it avoids the dangers and disadvantages of yet another big military expedition, its results can only be negative.But it is clear that the only people who can really carry out the larger policy &apos; of securing the whole Trans-Siberian line as far as Tcheliabinsk or Samara are the Japanese, and although we may accompany them with a camouflage of Allied contingents, these will by force of circumstances be so scanty that there will be scarcely a man left to hold up an Allied flag in Western Siberia. The first question is what will be the effect in Siberia and in Russia generally of a Japanese advance along the railway? We have telegraphed to Kieff, Novo Tcherkask, Ekaterinodar, and Tiflis to find out the probable attitude of the various local Governments, and it is possible that they, realising the material advantages of having this source of supplv kept open, will acquiesce.The only reply we have so far received has been from Tiflis, and it is certainly encouraging : the gist of it is that the local authorities are so busy with their own affairs that they are unlikely to trouble themselves much about how we secure control of the Trans-Siberian Railway, while on the other hand the advantages which such control would bring&apos;to them would only be welcome.If Southern Russia accepts the situation, it is very doubtful whether Petrograd, even if hostile, can send sufficient forces to prevent our control of the railway. A definite rupture with the Bolsheviks may, of course, ensue, but that must be accepted as one of the possible consequences of this policy. We have, however, two other factors to consider and two possible obstacles to overcome before we can definitely embark upon this policy.The first is the attitude of the Japanese themselves.  Can we induce them to do more than take Vladivostock and the whole of the maritime provinces?   This they would be ready enough to do, but we must make certain that they will extend their * operations along the railway.   The best argument that we can use is that if they do not act as we propose, the Germans will substitute themselves for the Russians in Siberia.   We must also induce the Americans to exert all the pressure they can on the Japanese. Unfortunately, the other obstacle is the attitude of the United States. &apos;It is true that the United States Government are now sending the &quot; Brooklyn &quot; to Vladivostock, but they have shown the greatest reluctance to embark on any venture in Siberia, and they will certainly be averse to encouraging the Japanese to establish themselves there permanently.   We can only endeavour to make it plain to them that this move is imperative in the Allied interest, and point out that there is a certain advantage, more particularly for the United  States,   in engaging . JaDanese energies in Siberia, and thus limiting their activities in the south of China and on the Pacific Coast.
It is interesting to note, that M. Nabokoff has just stated that he and the Russian Ambassadors in Raris and Rome are agreed that Allied co-operation in Siberia is most desirable, subject to the following reservations:-(1.) That action should be taken with the knowledge and consent of the Administrative authority at Siberia, which is opposed to the Bolsheviks and Germans.(2.) That in no circumstances should Japan be given a mandate by the Allies to act independently.(3.) That, whatever measures may be considered necessary for the protection of foreigners and to prevent war material and railways falling into the hands of the Bolsheviks and Germans, they should not assume the character of military occupation to the exclusibn of the Russian&quot; Administration.(4c.) The above principle to be agreed upon between the Allies, thus showing the purely temporary character of the military measure taken on Russian territory to strengthen the Administration which is loyal to the Allies against the activities of the enemy and iiis confederates.If His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the general line of policy indicated in the above notes, the following action appears to be called for: &apos;(1.) To await the replies from Odessa, Tiflis, &amp;c, as to the effect of a Japaneseadvance on the Siberian Railway. (2.) If they are favourable, to sound the French, Italian, and AmericanGovernments at once as to approaching the Japanese. (3.) With our Allies, urge the Japanese Government to take action, framingthe scheme on the basis indicated by M. Nabokciff, (4.) Endeavour to get into touch with the various Siberian authorities andexplain the Allies&apos; intention to them.If the replies from Odessa, &amp;c, are unanimously unfavourable, we shall probably have to content ourselves with the control of Viadivostock and Harbin.Foreign Office,January 16, 1918.Note. The Treasury representative on the Committee does not feel empowered to express an opinion, as the question is purely political and military.
