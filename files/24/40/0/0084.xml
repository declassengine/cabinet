It would be very easy to turn away public attention from Africa and Asiatic Turkey in another direction if this seemed desirable.The account of the internal condition of GermanyWe have reoontly received full confirmation frome.g.28.1.18.
16 January, 1918.This report on the situation in Germany is basedupon information received from a writer who has just returned from a twelve days&apos; stay in Berlin.THE KAISER.Since the outbreak of the Russian revolution the Kaiser&apos;s r01e in the political life of Germany has been, if not an entirely passive one, that of a mediator between the s reactionary and progressive movements.     In regard to inter-national policy the Kaiser is said to hold the middle line between the Annexationists and the Reichstag Majority and to be a supporter of schemes whioh tend towards increasing economic influence rather than what the Military Party call an &quot;adjustment of frontiers&quot;.    He is a strong partisan of the &quot;Middle Europe&quot; scheme, and for this reason a supporter of a peace of semi-annexation with Russia.     In the Polish question he has strongly opposed the Austrian solution of the problem and would, in the oase of a separate peace with Russia, prefer Poland to join the Russian Federation.    Whilst Admiral Tirpitz is known to inspire Hindenburg and Ludenforff, the Kaiser^ most trusted adviser is Dr. Helfferich, who very often sucoeeds in impressing the Kaiser with a moderate version of the Military Party1s views.    During the recent events Count Hertling and Dr. v. Ktthlmann have, to a oertain extent, had the Kaiser&apos;s ear.    The political programme as laid down in Dr. v. Kttfalmann1s Look WELTPOLITIK UUP KEIff KRIEG (the book appeared anonymously shortly before the war) brs, since the entry of America into the war, occupied t$e Kaiser&apos;s mind,, who at frequent occasions has reoommended its perusal to the leaders of the politioal parties. ^*-(1)   This book deals chiefly with the African problem and suggests the attainment of a large African Empire by negotia-tions.   It is cuite probable that the Emperor is himself inter-ested in this project and we know that it is being strongly pressed in Germany by the more moderate parties; especially associated with it are Dr.Solf, the Colonial Secretary, a man who has a high reputation, and Professor Delbruck.
THE OBOYffl PRIflOE.The Crown Prince^ frefluent appearanoes in Berlin and his presence at important councils are not attributed to his importance as a determining factor.    It is known in poli-tical circles in Berlin that the Crown Prince is merely an echo of the Militarists, though there is said to be a good deal of jealousy inspiring him against Ludendorff.    But the Prince sincerely shares the views of Admiral Tirpita, and his r$le is rather to pervert influential politicians to his standpoint either toy flattery, or failing this, by brow--beating.    His influence with the Kaiser is said to be nil.In domestic matters the vicissitudes of the Prussian Franchise Bill are entirely due to the Kaiser1s hesitation.    His belief in the divine origin of the Prussian Monarchy is still unshaken.    The present draft-bill whioh enrages the Conservatives without satisfying the Progressives is about the maximum of concession the King of Prussia will grant his people.THE PEOPLE.Prior to the meeting of the Brest Litovsk Confer-ence, the situation in Berlin was an extremely critical one. The Independent Socialists hed made enormous headway.    The confidence in the Army had dwindled away and the much-praised U-boat activity had not yielded the promised result.    The rational portion of the German people realised that the end of the war could only be arrived at by the people getting hold of the Reioastag and thus influencing its decisions. The relations between majority and minority Socialists became less strained, and the possibility of co-operation had already been considered with a view to revolutionary organisation, in regard to which the Minority Socialists had already achieved a good deal of work in Saxony and in various army sections at the front, where the spirit of the Soviets was gaining
ground.Admiral Tirpitz was one of the first to realise the danger.    The intense aotivity of the Yaterlandspartei, espec-ially their strenuous propaganda at the front and among the workmen in the Hinterland, was inspired &quot;by the necessity of counteracting the dissemination of revolutionary ideas which were rapidly spreading all over Germany.    The main argument of the Socialist propaganda was the impossibility of peace in the present oireumstances.    The Tirpitz propagandists argued   the inopportunity of peace in these oircumstances.    They played upon the German workmen1s new experience as a big money-earning power and demonstrated to him, by cleverly constructed diagrams, how in case of an unfavourable peace the lack of raw materials and of opportunities for export would speedily reduoe the work-men to starvation wages and make it impossible for their demo-bilised comrades to find employment.     (The Socialists admit themselves that this propaganda had a certain retarding effect upon their own v/ork).    With the mi&amp;dle-olasses they employed the patriotic argument.    All over Germany posters appeared exhibiting in striking oolours the conditions of peace that might have been obtained at the end of 1916 as against far better ones obtainable in December 1917, and finally conquest with the German peace of 1918.Yet the people were not fully satisfied, because the propagandists -could not tell them bow such a peace was to come. The Army and the Navy had ceased to be a fetching argument and there was the prospect of the American intervention which, though most people were inclined to consider it as a mere bluff -or, at its best, as a highly exaggerated proposition, was yet liable to encourage the Western peoples to oontinue the war. The chances inclined to the side of the revolutionary movement. At the front (in the West and in the East) the signs of dis-affection increased.     So did the explosions in the munition
factories.    Even the highly protected Krupp works had to suffer the lose of a whole section when on December 19tb several departments of the section Pressbau III. containing, it is said, 300 electric motors, were burnt to ashes.    Another very impor-tant explosion took .;lace early in December at Magdeburg-Buckau, where a huge briok shed with its contents of over 60 railway engines ready for delivery, was reduced to dust.The meeting of the Conference of &apos;Breet Idtovsk gave the people8s moral a new lease of life.    Informant found the Berlin population oalm, self-confident and in a state of expeo-tation that was certain to be satisfied.    A separate peace with Russia meant so many eeonomlo possibilities,,and it meant, as the Tirpits party were not slow in assuring the people, a speedy German peace.    The Independent Socialists were despairing whilst the official ones confessed to the pleasant feeling of seeing their way out cf a thorny dilemma.The news of the firBt rupture of negotiations came(I)like a staggering blow.    At Sen KBlln    a revolution in minia-ture started.    The Town-Council assembled and passed a reso-lutloa in the sense of the Minority Socialists, the publication of whioh was speedily prohibited.    3!be population of Berlin became so restless that the shops in prominent thoroughfares closed and the workmen struck work.    Everybody seemed consumed with the desire to be in the street and to discuss events. Experienced observers of the Berlin population assured informant that they would not be able to bear the pressure of a disappoint-meat.    A failure of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations would, of necessity, lead to an enormous expansion of the revolutionary idea.    A Minority Sooialist completed this opinion by adding: &quot;The ifieldgreys1 at the front will not stand it;   there our preparations are nearly ready&quot;.    It is, perhaps, ae well to
take these words with the necessary grain of saltI    Undoubted-ly, there is at least the nucleus of an organised revolutionary movement at the front, but one would like to have some more oon-vincing evidence before believing in its efficiency.     German history end knowledge of the psychology of the German people do not encourage the belief in an efficient German revolution, and a failure would be the worst thing that could happen.EGOHQMIO OOflDITlONS.Informant found the food question in Berlin much more satisfactory than during his stay there a year ago.    On meat-days the ration of meat obtained in restaurants was sufficient though, owing to the laok of fat and butter, only boiled or grilled meat is being served even at such expensive places as the Adlon.    The quality of the bread has much im-proved;   fish, vegetables and potatoes are of good quality. He oould even obtain tea fresh from Russia, at the price of 8 marks a cup without sugar, milk or bread.    The traces of the trade with Russia are already noticeable.    What strikes the visitor most is the desperate state of the clothing.    Well-to-do people walk about in clothes whioh in normal times would be despised by street-hawkers.    Especially conspiouous is the absence of overcoats and the lack of reputable linen.    Most people, especially of the professional classes, wear frayed linen with soft collars and no cuffs.    People who can afford the prices wear silk shirts of the most impossible oolourg. But the saddest aspect is that of foot-wear.    Informant saw in the bitter cold of the December and January days prominent people wearing light yellow summer shoes.    The middle-classes affect a kind of sandal,&apos; consisting of felt uppers and wooden soles.    The poor wear sabots.    Some people who feel imcem-fortable hide their feet-wear in a sort of felt over-boot, possibly to conceal the lack of seoks which are only to be
obtained of the silken variety.    Hobody seems to know what kind of clothes they will wear in the spring;   the secondhand shops have already been emptied and even the unredeemed pledges of the pawn-broker have been requisitioned for distribution among the ppor.    There was some hope of obtaining the, huge supplies of cotton and wool said to have been captured in Italy, but whatever there may have been has been requisitioned for the clothing of the Army.An important fact was disclosed to Informant by several of his industrial friends, and this fact he has been able to verify by interviewing Socialist parliamentarians, the greatest apprehension in German industrial circles at present is the laok of machinery.    It is absolutely impossible to get the utterly used-up plant renewed and, what is still worse, any particle of machinery that is still in working order may at any. moment and without notice be requisitioned for the purposes of munition work.    Any sort of industry not connected with the produotion of ammunition is completely neglected. This precarious state of things is made still worse by labour troubles.    The worfemen are pliable enough;   they are being paid unheard of wages (by which they do not profit, spending the money as soon as they get it on jewellery and other luxuries) but they are either old hands or men invalided out of the army who are physically unable to do efficient work.Another grave matter is the transportation crisis, ^he usually perfectly reliable German railway service has utterly broken down.     Delays on short journeys of a couple of hours do not cause astonishment any more.    A journey to Berlin, in normal times a.matter of 12 hours, is now subject to four changes with waiting intervals of from lj to 4 hours, taking in all 26 hours.    In this case there may be an excuse for frontier formalities, but even in the interior the travel-ling accommodation is a4 that of 50 years ago, the carriages  * being worn out, the metals allowing only of slow progress and
the stores at the coaling-stations insufficiently supplied. Informant was told that this was an exceptional situation just now, a good deal of the railways&apos; rolling-stock having been sent to the occupied parts of Russia to carry back goods (or Boldiers?) But this surely does not seecunt for the lack of coal and for the dangerous condition ox the track.Nor are trade conditions more satisfactory, for the simple reason that there seems to be nothing to trade with.   Thefx&apos;only branch of mercantile enterprise that is doing well is finance as regards the illegitimate part of its business.    companies, which will Btart their work after the war, are being promoted in incredible numbers in spite of legal restrictions, which are only applied to Individual promoters.    Most of these companies are expeoted to undertake business the very nature of whioh is anything but certain at present, and nearly all these enterprises, floated by the big banking concerns, aim at usurping business in those countries whioh are supposed to be going to join the Middle Europe concern;    Thus the paper-currency, considered at least as doubtful by the Germans, goes to Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland^ Austria and Hungary, to buy real estate there and to pave the way for unscrupulous exploitation.    The favourite trick is to increase the share capital of limited companies abroad and thus to acquire a controlling interest.    The shipping companies, banks, insurance companies and big industrial concerns of the allied countries are thus being Germanised.    It is a real conquest, of which no peace-treaty will be able to deprive the Germans.BOLKCIOiX ABCS.Informant left Berlin on the 9th January. This was in the middle of the Brest-Idtovsk crisis. The information he collected from very reliable eourees as to the real German war-aims proves that in the East a more or less pronounced annexation
of the occupied territories was intended.     In this respect it is interesting to consider the r6le of ;Dr.v. tlhImann.   In spite of the attacks of the Conservative circles on the Secre-tary of State it is a mistake to think that his attitude was one of disinterestedness pur et simple.    Kiihlmann is known to as-pire to ultimate friendly relations with England and for this reason to repudiate all ambitious ideas of annexation in Belgium.    Yet he knows quite well ihat a policy of non-annexa-tion  as a matter of principle would force him to leave the Wilhelmstrasse and to make room for a successor more acceptable to the representatives of the annexationist theory.    On the other hand be has to be careful not unduly to exasperate his Austrian colleague, who desires peace before everything else because he must have it.    Hence that ingenuous formula, whioh was intended to- satisfy everybody, has estranged the Progres-sives from Ktthlmann because they realise its veiled purpose, which might compromise the chances of a separate peace, and has, at the same time, enraged the Conservatives, who find it too mild.    The fact, however, is that Kflhlmanu is as much for an economic dependence of Lithuania and for the annexation of Courland and parts of Livonia and Esthonla as the annexationists themselves.    It is only a difference of procedure.Ludendorff and the interests his name oovor want much more than this.    It has become a new theory with the German annexationists that Austria-Hungary must not be allowed to establish a close relationship with Poland and - what seems to be an Austrian ambition - with the Ukraine.    Now, if Ktlhl-mann were to show his cards in the usual brutal manner of German diplomacy, he would certainly drive Austria into a separate peace with Russia, a matter which has been under con-alderation in Vienna already.    Thus the difficulties of hie game increase, and it depends entirely on the diplomatic skill
of TrctSki whether he will suooeed or not.    But is Trotski an antagonist to he feared?    On the answer to this query depends a good deal.    Is Trotski sincere, or are the difficulties he is raising mere play pour epater le bourgeois^&quot;Informant brings the news (which is a matter of current gossip at the Austrian Embassy in Berlin) that Trotski was an ^acquisition&quot; o  Prince Emil Furstenberg, who since March 1917 has been attached to the Austrian legation at Stockholm as a kind of free-lance.    Prince Emil Fflrstenbarg has been known to the writer for a good many years and is believed to be the man to succeed in such work.    Prior to his departure to Stockholm be used to stay at Amsterdam where he had very intimate relations with the Dutch Socialist Party, whose Stockholm scheme he presently supported.    It was with an eye to the Stockholm Conference that be left for the Swedish capital.    But there is another important point which seems, to a certain extent, to corroborate the rflle of Ftlrstenberg. Informant was told in Berlin that Trotski1a first secretary and principal assistant at the Russian Foreign Office was a journalist of the name of Dr., Salkind, who for years past used to be a correspondent of Russian papers in Vienna and in this capacity had been closely attached to the Press Bureau there. It has, at any rate, been noticeable that Trotski has always more polite language at his disposal when dealing with Austria and that, in spite of his apparent doctrinarism, he has yielded at o&amp;ce to the Austrian claim to forbidding the discussion of her nationalities at Brest Litovsk.As regards the Allies, informant observed that the former hatred of England had as completely vanished as the former predilection for Franco.    At present the enemy is America.    This is not only an omotional hostility but an enkity based upon hard facts od ffeltpolitik.    The exploitation
cf Russia and of China are about the Only real aiias^irtriJjL -studied by German politicians, and both-ommtrles constitute the future field of American enterprise,    The German political circles sincerely disbelieve in an efficient American intervention, but the population is terribly afraid of air-raids on a large scale. Even as regards future competition in Russia and China there is not much apprehension;   the -Germans have an unshakable oon-fidenoe in the superiority of their- buslne^s-^^thoda - and in the propaganda-organisation whioh the Krupp Syndicate are building up at the price of enormous expenditure.    And, politically speaking, every German who takes an interest in Weltpolltik seems firmly oonvinoed that the future Ally of Germany will be -Japan.    The adepts of German Realpolitlk,,xefuse to forget and refuse to learn.
