DETAILED REPORT OIT BOMB RAID CARRIED OUT DURING THE DAY, 14TR&quot; J ACTUARY 1918 *Two formations, of 6 De Haviland 4:s each, left between 10.15 and 10.20 a.ivu, to attack the Railway Station and Munition Works in and around Karlsruhe.     The Raid lad by Captain BtJcSIlly left the vicinity of the Aerodrome at 10.30 a cm o     The formation crossed the lines at Raon-L!Etape, at a height of 10,000 feet, proceeded up the Vosges to Saverne, thence to Hagenau, and from there via Rastatt to Karlsruhe.     Patches of thick mist were encountered and banks of low clouds during the whole journey.     The latter resulted in the formation being continually broken up, but they were rallied again by Captain Silly.     The Aerodrome at Hagenau was visible and seven enemy.aircraft left as the formation passed over.Karlsruhe was reached at noon, and bombs were dropped by both formations almost simultaneously;   the first formation dropping at noon, the second formation 12.5 p.m.     The height was then 12,500/ feet.16 -* 112 lb.bombs, 4- 230 lb bombs and 1 - 40 lb (phosphorous) bomb were dropped, making a total of 2,752 lbs. The results, many of which are confirmed by photographs appear to be 300a.     Four bursts were observed in the Town and Railway Works, two on the Railway junction in the centre of the Town, two on the Workshops on or about the Main Junction of the Railway in the Town, and a fire was started in the neighbourhood of these places.     Various stages of this fire are very clearly seen in the &quot;photographs tThe hostile machines which had left Hagenau, as the formation passed over, now engaged the formation/    Apparently only three cut of the seven were able to reach the necessary height.     These attacked but were kept at a considerable distance by the fire of our Observers.     They followed the formation as it returned to within 10 miles of the line.
Fifty-two plates were exposed and the results are exceptionally good.     The fire reported bein/r very distinct.Karlsruhe was very well defended by A.A. and the fire was severe and accurate and three machines were damaged.It is worthy of note that contrary to the experience at Mannheim no barrage was put up before the machines arrived.   As soon as the machines arrived the A.A. opened fire and apparently aimed at the machines, whereas at Mannheim almost five minutes before the arrival of the formation the A.A. commenced to put up their barrage, without aiming at the formation at all.All our machines returned safely and commenced to land at 2*10 p.m.Although the temperature on the ground was not as low as it has been, the conditions experienced by pilots and observers in the air seemed to be more severe.     There are three cases of frost bite of which one is very bad, but this is confined to the face., and in every case the electrical clothing and gloves were entirely satisfactory.The E.A. were the Albetros scout type and from their esti-mated speed and ability to climb would appear to be D3s.The weather conditions on the whole were fairly good, the light being strong, out there were &quot;low banks of drifting mist and banks of clouds at 12,000 feet which considerably interfered with the formation&apos;s return.(signed)   J.^.A.Baldwin,Major,Commanding 41st Wing, R.F.C.In the Field. 14th January 1918.
SECRET.DETAILED REPORT OF BOMB RAIDS CARRIED OUT DURING NIGHT 14th/15th JANUARY, 1918.11 machines of xNo. 100 Squadron, R.F.C. left to bomb the teel Works at Diedenhofen at 5.5 p.m.   &apos;2 machines returned with engine failure,Bombs were dropped as under9 - 230 lb. 43 -   25 lb, 3-40 lb,(phos.)   TOTAL. 3.265 lbs.6 machines only were able to reach the -Objective, and thefollowing bombs were dropped on the Railway Station and Factory atDiedenhofen, from an average height of 1,500 feet.   6-230 lb. bombs,29-25 lb, bombs, and 2-40 lb. (phosphorous) bombs,   3-230 lb. &quot;bombswere observed to burst in the Factory with apparently good results.On the arrival of the first machine the Factory was seen tohe brilliantly lit up, but as soon as the first bomb was dropped, allthe lights were at once cut off .   The first bomb, however, caused afire, and this attracted the remaining machines,   2-230 lb, bombs wereobserved to burst on or near the Railway track South of DiedenhofenStation and one apparently very near to a train.   The majority of the25 lb. bombs were dropped on the Station and it is thought one O.K. ona train was obtained.2-230 lb. and 12-25 lb, bombs were dropped on the Railwayjunction and Dump near Port Von Goeben,   One enormous explosion followedand the bursts of the 25 lbs, lit up the rails but Insufficiently tostate definitely what damage was done.&apos;&apos;1-230 lb. and 2-25 lb, and 1-40 lb.- (phos.) bombs weredropped on Ebingen Railway Junction.   Bombs appeared to burst onRailway and among lights of a well lit area in the neighbourhood ofthe track.A total of 1,680 rounds was fired at searchlights, trains and Stat ions.Anti-aircraft fire was considerable, but very inaccurate, and no phosphorous shells were observed this time,, although on the whole the fire seemed heavier.At the commencement operations were hampered by ground mist which rapidly turned into heavy cloud banks preventing all, except
the earlier pilots, in reaching the objective.   Some of the later pilots actually reached the objective but were unable to see it owing to mist and cloud, and so were obliged to attack the nearest visible Railway Junction.Apparently Diedenhofen had received no warning.as it was a blaze of lights when the first pilots approached, but these were quickly cut off.Searchlights were considerable and there were several barrages from them; one extending from Ivfetz to Remilly Forest.Railway and road traffic was considerable.Puxieux Aerodrome was lit up by two landing searchlights, flares and two searchlights operating from the Aerodrome.One pilot nnd his observer noticed a fire burning in the direction of Betsd.orf.,2 machines of No. 16 Squadron R.1I.A.S. started about 6.0 p,m, but were unable to reach their objective owing to low clouds and returned without dropping their bombs.(Sgd)   G.E.A., Baldwin.
