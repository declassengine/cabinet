LIQUOR  TRADE  FINANCE  COMMITTEE   (IRELAND),   1917.REPORTTOTHE RT. HON. HENRY EDWARD DUKE, K.C., M.P., CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND.INTRODUCTION.1. The Liquor Trade Finance Committee (Ireland), 1917, was appointed by Warrant dated the 29th June, 1917, to inquire into and report upon the terms upon which the interests concerned in the manufacture and supply of intoxicating liquors in Ireland should be acquired and the financial arrangements which should be made during the period of control prior to the acquisition of such interests by the State, upon the assumption that the Government may be compelled as an urgent War measure to assume control of the manufacture and supply of intoxicating liquors during the War and the period of demobilisation, to be followed as a matter of necessity by purchase, after the War, of the interests involved.2. Having regard to the objects and nature of the control the assumption of which, as an urgent War measure, was anticipated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, we have been able to consider, what interests, if any, of the Liquor Trade might be excluded from any scheme of purchase, without interfering with the objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government has in view.3. We have not concerned ourselves with, either the general or financial policy involved in the purchase of the Liquor Trade as these questions were not referred to us.4. Certain documentary and statistical material has been furnished to us by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise and by the Board of Inland Revenue, the Commissioner of Valuation and the Statistical Section of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, and we have also obtained published matter bearing directly upon the Liquor Trade in Ireland.   -5. We gave every interest likely to be affected an opportunity of bringing before us its special circumstances, and point of view, and this opportunity was availed of by them all. The Committee sat on twenty-three days and examined sixty-four witnesses whose evidence was recorded, and, in addition, we received a considerable number of written memoranda.6. Most of the witnesses examined were delegated by Organised &quot;Associations representing different branches of the Liquor Trade, and, either, through these Associations or by individuals, evidence was given on behalf of every interest concerned.7. The witnesses representing the Publicans&apos; Trade Associations in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick and other places, who attended to give evidence, were unanimous in stating that the number of licensed public houses in Ireland was excessive, and that a large percentage of them might be abolished with advantage to the public. They stated the willingness of the Trade to. pay contributions to provide a fund for compensating the owners of such licences as might be abolished.
8. We found a reluctance on the part of the representatives of the Distillers&apos; and of some of the Brewers&apos; Associations to give us information as to their profits. Consequently we have experienced considerable difficulty in dealing with the question of the compensation to be paid for the acquisition of the interests in these branches of the Trade and in&apos; estimating the probable cost of their acquisition.&apos; Our difficulty was increased by the fact that there is not in Ireland any body of skilled Valuers, such as exists in England, having experience in the valuations of Breweries and Distilleries, from whom evidence could be obtained.GENERAL.9. There are certain matters in which the position in Ireland differs from that existing in England. In the first place, the Poor Law Valuation in Ireland is not kept up to date in the same way as it is in England. The valuation of all lauds tenements and hereditaments is made by or under the direction of one central authority, the Commissioner of Valuation. A general valuation of all the lands tenements and hereditaments in Ireland was made between the years 1852 and 1865, and since that was completed there has been no general re-valuation in Ireland, except in the cities of Belfast and Dublin. The re-valuation of the former was completed in the year 1906 and that of the latter in the year 1915. There is an annual revision of valuation, but in practice only cases of new buildings, or where there have been additions to or external structural alterations of old buildings, are dealt with on this revision and then only in such cases as are officially brought under the notice of. the Commissioner. In no case, except in Belfast and Dublin, has the additional value due to the premises being licensed been taken into account in the Poor Law Valuation. All local rates and public taxes and the Excise License Duties are assessed upon the basis of the Poor Law Valuation. But for the reasons mentioned, we consider that valuation would not be a, satisfactory basis of the present annual value of the premises dealt with in this Report,10. Valuations have been made in pursuance of and for the purposes of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910. But they have not been made to such an extent or upon such a basis as would, in our opinion, justify us in recommending them as a satisfactory or reasonably simple means of ascertaining the values to be applied to the interests dealt with.11. Another point of difference is that there are comparatively few tied houses in Ireland; only about 400 in all, and these are attached to two breweries in Cork. There may be a few others attached to another brewery, but our information on the point is not very clear.   The tie is less stringent than that existing in England.12. It is also to be borne in mind that the Licensing Laws so far as they affect the publicans in Ireland are not, in some material respects, the same as in England or in Scotland, as is explained later.13. It should also be noted, as marking the difference of the problem :  (1) That the average gravity of the beer manufactured in Ireland is much higher than the average gravity of the beer manufactured in Great Britain.(2) That one great brewery produces by far the largest output and outranks the other breweries as no brewery does in England.(3) That in the country districts, though not to the same extent in some of the towns, the publican almost invariably carries on a grocery or general supply business, as well as his liquor trade14. It is not easy to ascertain accurately the average consumption of drink in Ireland. But from the reports of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise and other information before us we think the average annual consumption for the four years prior to the war was about 3,175,000 gallons of proof spirits, British and Foreign, about .2,800,000 bulk barrels of all kinds of beer, ales, stout, porter, etc. (of which about 2,625,000 bulk barrels of 32 gallons each were Irish manufacture and about 175,000-bulk barrels of 36 gallons each were imported), and something under 1.100,000 gallons of wines of all kinds.    We have not included 1910 as
apparently, the quantity of spirits retained for consumption in that year, was considerably below the average for either the immediately preceding or for the succeeding years. There was also exported from Ireland a large quantity of spirits and beer manufactured in the country.15. Most of the witnesses examined were of opinion that the basis of purchase, so far as it might depend upon net profits, should be taken on a fixed, period prior to the War some suggested three years, some five years, and others a longer period. We are of opinion that in the case of Distillers, Brewers and Dealers, five years prior to the War would be a reasonable period, but, in the case of publicans and other interests, thr.ee years might be considered sufficient, owing to the difficulty of obtaining the necessary particulars and accounts of their trading.16. In dealing with quantities, prices and profits we do not say that our figures are absolutely accurate, but they are as nearly right as we could make them with the information at our disposal.DISTILLERS.17. According to the returns furnished to us, there were in Ireland on the 31st March, 1917, twenty-seven Distilleries paying a net Excise License Duty of  4,900 per annum. The majority of the concerns produce Pot Still spirits, only, but taking them all together the patent still production is the larger of the two, and is now reserved for Government purposes. The Distilleries are owned by twenty-one or twenty-two separate companies, firms or individuals. Some of these are limited companies, some are partnerships, and some are owned by indi-viduals. Of the limited companies, only two or three are in the ordinary sense public companies having their shares quoted on the Stock Exchange. The others are private limited companies, some having the transfer of their shares restricted by their Articles of Association. The shares of these companies were, therefore,, not quoted on the Stock Exchange; and their, balance sheets filed with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies afforded little or no information or assistance in our inquiry. Of course, we had no means of ascertaining the amount of capital em-ployed in their business by private owners, or the amount of profit they made, or how their business was conducted unless such information had been furnished voluntarily. Two of the witnesses representing the Distillers, themselves amongst the largest in the trade, told us they had endeavoured to ascertain the aggregate capital employed but had been unable to do soWe were able to ascertain fairly accurately that the average output of all-these distilleries was for the five years, 1910-1914, inclusive, about 10,000,000 proof gallons a year, and for the five years, 1905-1909, inclusive, about 11,800,000 proof gallons a year. The reduced output for the years 1910-1914 period was attributed by the witnesses to the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, the effect of which was, they alleged, disappearing before the war began. The official returns do not indicate that the recovery was a very rapid one.   &apos;18. We had no satisfactory evidence before us as to either Gross or Net Profits, of the Distillers. Their aggregate Assessment for Income Tax for the year 1911-12 amounted to  275,868.19. So far as we could ascertain, the Distillers do not own any lands or buildings outside the United Kingdom. In Ireland, in addition to their manu-facturing concerns, they own or rent stores, offices and malt houses in various places, the aggregate annual Poor Law Valuation of all lands and buildings held by them being  39,582.20. The stocks of home-made spirits remaining in Bond in Ireland are always very considerable, and a large proportion is allowed to mature to from five to seven years, and in some cases longer. On the 31st March, 1914, there were in Bond in Ireland nearly 27,000,000 gallons, and there is about the same quantity at present Of this, it was stated, that the Distillers owned one:half, perhaps more; and in addition to this, they had their stocks of raw material which vary from&apos; time toB
time but which on the average, must be of considerable value. Their machinery and manufacturing plant is also valuable. Some of the companies have reserve funds.21. The Distillers strongly objected to any compulsory purchase of their property, and their contention was that if purchase was to be carried out, it should be on a cash or its equivalent basis; that purchase and control should take place simultaneously, and that the proper and fair method of ascertaining the price would be by a valuation of their tangible assets, a certain number of years of their net profits to be added for goodwill, compulsory purchase, and the fact that they could no longer carry on their business in any part of the United Kingdom. They also asked that their employees should receive reasonable compensation. They con-si dered Stock Exchange prices would be a fallacious basis, and that giving a certain number of years&apos; purchase of net profits for everything would work out unfairly, as it might result in giving one too much and another a great deal too little. Some of them also stated that there wer,e expert valuers in England whose valuations they would be prepared to accept.22. Stock Exchange Quotations, Separate Detailed Valuations, and Income Tax Assessments have been suggested as bases for acquiring the interests in the Liquor Trade. We have carefully considered each of these methods and give our reasons for their rejection.We consider that prices based on Stock Exchange Quotations would be in-appropriate and unfair. In any case, Stock Exchange Quotations are not a very certain means of arriving at the true value of a concern. The affairs of a company may be so presented on a Balance Sheet as to make it more attractive to an investor than its true position really warrants. Premises may not be kept in repair. Insufficient allowances may be made for depreciation. The entire available profits may be distributed in dividends without creating a reserve fund to give stability to the concern Whereas another company, whose property and business is in reality of much greater value, may expend sufficient of its earnings on renewals and repairs, make due provision for depreciation, and, instead of dividing all its profits amongst its shareholders, create a reserve fund which would put the com-pany on a sounder and more secure foundation, but may not thereby enhance the price at which its shares are quoted, as what the purchaser in most cases looks to, is a large return for his money. But, even apart from this, in the case of the Irish Distillers, there is not a sufficiently large proportion of companies having shares freely bought and sold on the Stock Exchange to form a reliable basis upon which to ascertain anything like the real value of the property to be dealt with.23. The valuation in detail of all the tangible property in each case and then adding a certain number of years of the net profits for goodwill, compulsory pur-chase and the resultant inability to carry on the same trade in the United Kingdom, although, perhaps, the most accurate way of arriving at the price, would take too much time, involve too much expense, an,d require too many expert valuers on each side, to make it a method which we would recommend. Leaving the price to an expert, as was suggested, might lead to a deadlock, if the parties could not agree upon the expert to be appointed.24. The suggestion that Income Tax Assessments might be taken as showing the net profits would not, in our opinion, be satisfactory. The basis upon which the assessment is made and the methods by which it is arrived at would prevent its being safely used as showing net commercial profits, unless there was also an examination of the returns made by the parties assessed and a full consideration of the methods adopted. Besides, except by agreement or legislative enactment, these assessments and returns&apos;could not be made available. No doubt, if available, they might afford considerable assistance in arriving at the true net profits.25. We are of opinion that the purchase should be upon the basis of acquiring the fee-simple, free from incumbrance, of all lands and buildings used by the owners for the purposes of their business and all other property used in or directly connected with their business, also free from all charges.
20. We think the best course would be to adopt the principle of first ascer-taining. as accurately as possible, the average net annual profits of each concern for the five years prior to the war. In doing this due allowance should be made for Income fax and interest on mortgages, loans and debentures. Interest should be charged upon the amount of working capital necessary to carry on the business, and a proper amount for depreciation, &quot;etc., deducted. Of the net average income, when ascertained, a certain number of years&apos; purchase should be given for the acquisition of the fee-simple, free from incumbrance of all lands and buildings and for the machinery, plant, fittings and fixtures, goodwill, and every other property and interest used in or necessary for carrying on the business, exclusive of book debts, reserve funds (where separately invested), and the stock manufactured or unmanufactured. The book debts (save by agreement), and the invested reserve funds to remain the property of the owner, and the stock to be taken over by the purchasers at a price to be agreed upon, or failing agreement, to be fixed by the Tribunal hereinafter mentioned. In fixing the price of the stock, the question of Excess War Profits should be taken into account. The purchaser should take over all liabilities on existing contracts and indemnify the vendors in respect of these.27. We have excluded the book debts and separately invested reserve funds as the latter are really undivided profits not used in carrying on the business; and the former are not a necessary part of the business when purchased by the State and might not have an uniform relation either to the business or, its value. We have dealt with the stock-in-trade separately because the amount and value is so large and varies so much : some of the owners holding a very large stock of manufactured spirit for the purpose of maturing it and keeping up the standard and character of their production, while others hold much smaller quantities, at the same time showing perhaps as large net profits. If, therefore, the purchases w7ere carried out on the basis of including the stock in the assets purchased for a certain number of years of the net profits, serious injustice might be done to the owner of the large stock. The value of these stocks will form a very large portion of the entire property acquired. In 1914 they were probably worth from  2,000,000 to  3,000,000; and, at the joresent time, their market value wrould be very much in excess of this.28. All liabilities of the vendors, including debts due by them., mortgages, debentures, and other charges, and the claims of all parties having superior interests in the lands and premises as landlords or otherwise, should be transferred to and payable out of the purchase price. All these liabilities, except ordinary debts, should be ascertained on a pre-war basis.29. The question of debentures presents some difficulty and will require careful consideration by the Tribunal which we propose should be appointed. Debentures may be irredeemable, or redeemable upon a defined notice being given by the com-pany; they may be redeemable at par or at a premium, or they may be redeemed at a fixed date. Some may be secured by a Trust Deed and charged upon the whole or a definite portion of the company&apos;s property; and some may be merely a floating charge upon the assets of the company. All would become payable on the winding -up of the company, and would be entitled to payment in full so far as the assets; would admit. And, if this purchase by the State is to be taken as having the same effect as the winding-up of the company, the debenture holders would in many cases get mor,e, and in some cases less, than their debentures would have realized if sold in the market. This might be unfair to the other parties interested in the assets of- the company, and it might also be unfair to give only the pre-war market price to those who had an ample security on specific portions of the eompanVs property and who had no desire to sell. The difficulty might be got over by an enactment that, so far as debentures or debenture stock are concerned, the sale and purchase should not be treated as a winding-up of the company, but the amounts to which the debenture holders should be entitled should, in the event of all parties interested not agreeing, be determined by the Tribunal30. We have considered the question of naming a number of years&apos; purchase of the net profits ascertained as already described: and though we have considerable hesitation in doing this, we think that, in the case of a well-managed business, withB2
suitable and convenient premises kept in good order, and properly equipped with machinery, plant and fittings well maintained, and showing steady profits, the number of years&apos; purchase should not exceed twelve. But we do not consider it would be desirable to tie the Tribunal down to any hard and fast limit. In some exceptional cases of special advantages frpm situation or facilities for manufacture, or continuous and steady increase of profits, or exceptional value of buildings, machinery and plant, perhaps an extra allowance might be made; and in cases where the reverse of these conditions exists, or the profits are steadily diminishing, a con-siderably less number of years&apos; purchase might be quite sufficient. There may be cases where net profits are comparatively small and the value of the buildings, machinery and plant very large. Cases of this kind would have to be carefully considered by the Tribunal and the number of years&apos; purchase adjusted according!)&quot;.BREWERS.31. The breweries for sale in Ireland were, on the 31st March, 1017, twenty-six in number, paying  36,528 in Excise License Duty. Thei;e are no breweries other than those for sale. These breweries produced in the five years, 1910 to 1914, inclusive, an annual output of something over 3,900,000 standard barrels, which, as the specific gravity is considerably higher than the standard, would be equivalent to about 3,440,000 bulk, barrels of 36 gallons each, or nearly 3,870,000 bulk barrels of 32 gallons each, which is the capacity of the barrel used in Ireland. Of the amount produced, nearly 1,300,000 standard or about 1,230,000 bulk barrels of 32 gallons each were exported. The specific gravity of the export is higher, than the average.   A very large proportion of the entire business is owned by one company.Their aggregate assessment for Income Tax for the year 1911-12 amounted to  1,324,486.32. The Brewers do not, at all events to any substantial extent, own any lands or premises outside the United Kingdom. Some of them produce not only what Malt they require but also produce a quantity for sale; and some produce part of what they require and purchase or get the balance prepared by Malsters on commission. In addition to the beer, there are also bye products of yeast and grains; and some carry on the manufacture of mineral waters. The aggregate annual Poor Law Valuation of all lands and premises belonging to and used by&quot;the Brewers in connection with their business in Ireland is  44,787.33. We had before us a number of witnesses representing the Brewers&apos; Associ-ation and also some representing separate breweries. They all put forward views similar to those advanced on behalf of the Distillers.34. Although in the case of the Brewers, there is not the same system of holding manufactured goods for any lengthened period as exists in the case of the Distillers their products being disposed of practically as they are produced and the difference in price between that prior to the war and at the present time is not so great though very considerable, we do not see any ground for recommending a different basis of purchase in their case from that we have recommended in reference to the Distillers, except that we think thirteen years of the net profit should be substituted for the twelve years mentioned in r,espect of the Distillers, the Brewers&apos; business not being so much affected by legislative change as the Distillers.35. There are, as has already been mentioned, two breweries in Ireland which have tied houses to the number of about 400 in all. These houses are owned or rented by the Brewers, and are fully licensed premises. The Brewers let them to suitable persons on short terms, which are generally renewed at a rent agreed upon; the only restriction imposed upon the tenant being that he shall take from that Br,ewer all the beer he sells of the kind the Brewer makes. There is no restriction as to where he get his spirits or other drinks, and the Brewer does not interfere as to the prices he charges or the conduct of his business, save that if he conducts the house in any way which would endanger the licence, or that he otherwise proves unsuitable, the Brewer can get rid of him.
RECTIFIERS.38. There are no Rectifiers properly so-called in Ireland. Twelve licenses were issued to Rectifiers for the year ending 31st March, 1917, but we are informed by the Collector of Customs and Excise that these licenses were issued to Merchants who required them for their business of compounding spirits.DEALERS.39. These include Wholesale Merchants, Bottlers and Blenders. We could not ascertain the exact number, but, so far as we can see, there are about 800, paying an aggregate of  11,000 of Annual License Duty. In order to protect themselves against an infringement of the Law, the Wholesale Merchants take out a Retail as well as a Wholesale License. Something less than one-half of them deal in beer alone, and one firm in Dublin is one of the largest bottlers of beer and stout in the Trade. This particular firm is chiefly concerned in the bottling of beer and stout for export to foreign countries, and it also owns some lands and buildings abroad. So far as this firm is concerned there would be no necessity to purchase it, provided its trade was confined to export to foreign countries, and that the State gave reason-able facilities for carrying on such trade. Other companies and firms do a large business in blending and also in bottling spirits and in purchasing and selling foreign wine. Many of them keep in Bond, or in their own stores, large stocks of spirits and wines; and some of them keep these for a considerable time till they become matured. Several of them have large stores, some have only small premises and yet as Commission Agents and Bottlers make large incomes.In the case of the breweries that have tied houses, we think the houses them-selves should not be included in the property to be acquired for a definite number of years&apos; purchase of the net profits, as doing so would unduly increase the pro-portion of real property to profits of manufacture; and as presumably a higher number of years&apos; purchase should be applied to real estate than to business profits, this might unduly complicate matters. The fact that they have these houses as fixed customers may be an added element to the stability of the profits of the Brewers, and this could be taken into account in deciding the number of years&apos; purchase of the net profits to be allowed.Looking at the question of these &quot; tied houses &quot; with their limitation as de-scribed, it appears that they differ, little in their essentials from the ordinary &quot; on-licensed public houses &quot; in Ireland, with which, we deal hereafter.We are of the opinion that each of these &quot; tied houses &quot; should be treated as a separate entity, and that the Tribunal dealing with such cases will then be in a position to segregate the several interests therein of the owners of the lands and premises, the Brewers, the licensees, and others affected. The licensees would be entitled to the value of their stock, and any fittings and utensils which are theirs, and to a certain number of years&apos; purchase of their net profits to be determined by the Tribunal, having regard to the length of their unexpired terms, and their prospects of getting a renewal of their term.36. Malting, whether for the Brewers&apos; own use or for sale, should be treated as part of the business to be acquired, and the premises used for this purpose as part of the brewery premises.37. Where the Mineral Water manufacture is carried on as a separate business and upon premises separate from the brewery premises it is not necessary that it should be acquired; but the brewers may have some ground for. compensation on account of the additional cost of carrying it on as a separate concern over and above what it costs when managed and conducted along with the brewery business. Where it is carried on on the premises to be acquired by the State it&quot; should be treated as part of the entire business, but the Tribunal would take this into account when determining the number of years&apos; purchase.
40. They in point of fact act as Middlemen between the Manufacturers and the Retailers as well as supplying some private customers. If the manufacturing and retail interests are acquired by the State, we think the interests of the Dealers should in justice to them be acquired also. Their work of bottling and blending could be done at the place of production, and the profits of the State would be considerably enhanced by the disappearance of the intermediate profit.If, as is probable, the knowledge and experience of the Dealers are necessary to help the State, at all events in the early days of its monopoly, the businesses, or some of them, could be continued on Agency Terms. Arrangements for purchase should be made in all cases, and we recommend that the same basis and terms should be applied as in the case of the &quot;Off &quot; License Holders.FULLY LICENSED PUBLIC HOUSES-&quot; ON &quot; LICENSES.41. Of these, there were on the 31st March, 1917, 16,396 (including 334 hotels, 16 restaurants, 13 theatres and places of entertainment, and 14 railway refresh-ment rooms licensed on a different basis from ordinary public houses) paying a net License Duty of  153,043. There are also 283 houses licensed to sell beer, cider and perry&quot; for consumption on the premises, paying  589 Excise License Dutv. There are 506 licenced public houses in Dublin, 582 in Belfast, 480 in Cork, 244 &quot;in Limerick, 196 in Londonderry, and 173 in Waterford, the remainder being in the other towns and scattered over the country in villages and country places. In the cities and larger towns a considerable number of these houses are used only for the sale of drink; but, taking them as a whole, in the large majority of cases other businesses such as grocery, provision, hardware and drapery are carried on in the same premises and conducted by the same persons as the liquor trade, the entire premises being licensed for the sale of drink. Only a small proportion, and these only in the cities and larger towns, are used solely as business premises, the rule being that the houses are occupied as residences by the owners and their families and employees. Some of them have farms attached, and the business in a considerable proportion is conducted by the owners and their families without the assistance of paid employees.42. We have already dealt with the system of tied houses. Except in the case of these tied houses, all the public houses are free, and are either owned or held on leases or from year to year by the publicans. In the great majority of cases, even if their interest in the liquor trade is purchased, they would be most unwilling to part with their premises, as they are their residences and homes.43. There is also, as mentioned in para. 12, a very great difference between the position of the publican in Ireland and the position of the publican in England or in Scotland. There is no legislative provision for extinguishing public house licenses in Ireland such as exists in England under the Act of 1904, or for bringing into effect local option as is provided in Scotland by the Act of 1913. In Ireland a publican can only be refused a renewal or transfer of his license on the ground of unsuitability of the premises or unfitness of the applicant. Both of these objections can be and are got over either by putting the premises into proper condition or by transferring the license to a person who cannot be alleged to be unfit. Further, the Irish Act of 1902 prohibits the granting of new licenses, so that the publican in Ireland is in a much more secure position than the publican in either England or Scotland. Of course, if he does lose his license, there is no fund out. of which he can be compensated.44. In Dublin and Belfast, owing to their recent re-valuation, in which the additional value due to the license is included, the licensed duty is assessed on one-half the Poor Law Valuation. Outside these cities, for the purpose of assessing license duty, 20 per cent, is added to the Poor Law Valuation in cases where it does not exceed  50, and 5 per cent, in cases above that amount. In no case is the License Duty less than  5.45. The Poor Law Valuation of the large majority of the public houses in the smaller towns and villages and country places and even to some extent in the cities
is not very high. It has been -difficult to obtain figures; but making the best calcu-lation we could from the number of public houses (not including hotels, etc.) and the total amount of duty paid, the annual Poor Law Valuation would average about  18 a house, and this would, in nearly every case, include the entire premises, no matter, what additional business was carried on in them.46. A comparatively small number of publicans keep any accounts, and, in most cases, their receipts for purchases are destroyed after a year or two, so that there would be great difficulty in ascertaining their net profits from their books or accounts, and, in cases of mixed businesses, in segregating the liquor profits from the general profits of their trade. They are.all obliged to keep a Spirit Book which would show the amount of Spirits they have purchased; and it might be possible to ascertain from the receipts which&quot; they may have kept and. from the Brewers with whom they dealt the amount of beer, stout and porter which they purchased annually.47. We endeavoured to ascertain the gross and net profits on their sales of beer, porter, etc., and spirits. The evidence we got showed that the gross profits on draught porter and beer, after allowing for wastage, varied from 10s. to 16s. a 32-gallon barrel. On Extra Stout the profits were on an average higher, par-ticularly when sold in bottle, but Extra Stout was only a comparatively small part of the trade. We think a fair average for all might be taken at about 155-. a barrel. The gross profits on spirits when reduced were put at from 7.9. to 105. a gallon, equivalent probably to an average of 10s. per proof gallon. Various estimates were given as to how much of the gross would be net profits, and the result of the evidence led us to the conclusion that about one-third of the gross profits would represent net profits. Probably four-fifths of the beer, porter, etc., three-fourths of the spirits, and one-eighth of the wines consumed in Ireland, would be sold in public houses. So that on this basis, the aggregate net yearly profits of the publicans (excluding hotels, restaurants, etc.) on their average sales for the years 1911 to 1914, inclusive, would be, on beer, porter, etc., about  560,000. on spirits about  400,000, and on wines about  21,000, making in all about  981,000, and if the profits on mineral waters, cider, cordials, etc., be added, their annual net people would not exceed in all of  1,100,000 or, excluding as before, hotels, etc.. an average net profit of about  68 a house.48. The entire number of Income Tax Assessments in Ireland in respect of Retail Houses (hotels, inns, beer houses, etc.) was, for the year 1911-12, 2,6*74, and the aggregate amount assessed  625,500, or an average of about  240 an assess-ment. This, in hotels and public houses where other businesses were carried on, included profit on other things besides drink. The remaining 13,722 publicans were, therefore, presumably making less than  160 a year, from all sources, and some of them must have been making very little indeed.Our figures, where they are estimates deduced from evidence, may be erroneous; but we think the error cannot be very great and we have given them for the purpose of indicating, as nearly as we could, the amount of net profits to be dealt with.We had also some evidence as to sales of public houses in different parts of the country and the prices realized. This was of some assistance, but in the absence of particulars as to tenure, rent, condition of premises, etc., it did not, taken alone, enable us to arrive at any general basis of value.49. We recommend the following bases of purchase of public houses :-A. Where the premises are used solely as a Licensed public house. If the publican wishes to sell his interest in the premises or the State wishes to acquire it :-(a) The value of the fee-simple, free from incumbrances, should be ascer-tained by the Tribunal on the basis of a certain number of years&apos; purchase of the true net annual value, and out of this fund all superior interests should be redeemed and all incumbrances paid. The superior, interests to be valued by the Tribunal unless otherwise agreed upon.
. (b) The publican should be paid the value of his fixtures and fittings and also of his stock of liquor when taken over; as to the latter, subject to excess war profits, if applicable.(c) He should also be paid a number of years&apos; purchase of his net profits from the liquor business ascertained on an average of three to five years&apos; trading (at the option of the Tribunal) next prior to the war. We do not fix any number, but we suggest seven. In many cases it might be less, if, for, example, the profits were declining, accounts were not produced, or for any other reason which the Tribunal may think adequate.B. When the publican does not wish to sell his interest in the premises and the State does not wish to acquire it (b) and (c) will apply.C. Considerable difficulty may arise where the publican himself or the members of his family conduct the business, and this will be increased where they conduct another business or other businesses in conjunction with the liquor business. In order to ascertain the true net profits a deduction for these services should be made from the gross profits, and the persons ren-dering them could be compensated for loss of employment on such terms as the Tribunal may consider reasonable. But this would be a very difficult matter to work out, and we think the Tribunal should be left to deal with the matter either (1) by making no deductions from the gross profits on account of these services and giving a smaller number of years&apos; purchase of the profits without these deductions, which would in that, case include com-pensation for loss of employment; or (2) by ascertaining the net profits by applying the average net profits on the sale of drink in the district to the quantity of drink sold by the publican, and giving him such a number of years&apos; purchase of this net profit as will, in the opinion of the Tribunal include reasonable compensation for loss of employment b)^ the persons who conduct the business.THE  OFF-LICENSE  HOLDERS  AND  SPIRIT  GROCERS.50. These, on the 31st March, 1917, numbered in all 1,068, and paid an aggregate license duty of  17,301, subject to some rebate for curtailment of hours of sale. Few of them carry on the liquor business alone. In the large majority of cases it is carried on along with other businesses and in the same premises. We had no means of ascertaining the aggregate volume of their liquor trade. Their gross profit is less than the publicans, and the evidence leads us to the conclusion that their net profits would not exceed 25 per cent of their gross profits.51. We recommend that they should be dealt with on the same basis as recom-mended in the case of the publicans, but we would substitute five years instead of seven years of net profits subject to the same observations.HOTELS  AND  RESTAURANTS.52. We do not think it is necessary in carrying out a scheme of purchase and control of the liquor trade that the interests of hotels and restaurants in the sale of drink should be acquired. But in the case of hotels or restaurants which have bar,s mainly used for the sale of drink, these bars should be acquired upon the same basis as the publicans&apos; interests, or they should be wholly discontinued. In order to secure that in the future hotels and restaurants are not made a substitute for the public house, legislative provision should be made that their licenses should be withdrawn in the event of their, receipts from the sale of drink exceeding a specified percentage of their entire receipts as hotels, and that an inspector should be at liberty from time to time to examine their books and accounts to see that this percentage is not exceeded.
THEATRES, PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT, RAILWAY REFRESHMENTROOMS.53. We do not think it is necessary that the liquor interest of these should be purchased, but they should be subject to inspection in order to secure that they are not exceeding the reasonable use of their licenses. If they are habitually so exceeding, their licenses should be withdrawn.STEAMBOATS. 54. There is no necessity to interfere with these.CLUBS.55. We do not think there is any necessity to acquire the liquor interest of clubs, but we think they should be dealt with on lines somewhat similar to those we have suggested in reference to hotels and restaurants.ALLIED TRADES.56. We think the only allied trade that need be dealt with is that of the Malsters. There are about twenty-two or twenty-three malting companies or firms in Ireland carrying on their business at different places in Dublin and the country. Some of these also carry on the business of Malt Roasters. Their Association was represented by witnesses before us, and we also heard witnesses representing the Malt Roasters. Some of them malt on commission for the brewers, and these and the others also purchase grain and malt it on their own account and sell it either to the brewers in Ireland or in England, but chiefly in Ireland. Their business, though separately owned, is, for all practical purposes, a necessary part of the brewing trade. They, made the case that, if the brewers were purchased out, they should be bought out also, as the State, being then their&apos; sole customer, would be in a position to impose upon them what terms it pleaded, or do the malting for its own breweries if it so desired.57. We are of opinion that if the brewers are purchased and no arrangement can be made with the Malsters, their business should be acquired also. So far as we could ascertain the business is a profitable one. The buildings are considerable, but the machinery and plant, though valuable, are not large in proportion to the profits. The stock of raw material varies with the seasons. In the Autumn and Winter it is very considerable, but not so large at other seasons of the year. Their customers being the brewers, they make no bad debts, and their business is a stable one.58. If the State purchases the breweries and continues the business, we think it would be desirable and quite feasible to come to some arrangement writh the Malsters whereby they could continue their business for the State without being purchased. If this cannot be done, then they should be purchased upon the basis of the fee-simple value of their lands and buildings, free from incumbrances, and also the value of their trade, machinery, fixtures, plant, and stock-in-trade, and ;i certain number of years&apos; purchase of their net annual profits, based on an average of five years prior to the war, for goodwill, compulsory purchase, etc. We think about five years&apos; purchase of these net profits would be reasonable where everything was in good order, the business well managed and profits showed steady main-tenance, the Tribunal to have full power to take into account any exceptional circumstances.EMPLOYEES.59. The classes of persons employed and the terms of employment vary very much. No general scheme: of pensions exists in any sections of the trade, but wV are satisfied that in some of the large concerns Old or disabled employees are treated on a sympathetic arid considerate basis.: The largest breWery has a definite but- &apos; &apos;       &apos; : c &apos;
purely voluntary scheme of pension and allowances which extends to dependents of the employees, and we were furnished with a copy of this scheme which will be found appended to Mr. Sutton&apos;s evidence. We think this scheme, and provisions which are made by other employers, should be considered and, if possible, the em-ploy ees affected by them should not be placed in a worse position by reason of the State taking over the property and business.60. No compensation need be paid in any case where the State is able and willing to give employment analogous in character and equivalent in remuneration, and such offer is not accepted.Where employment is accepted at the same salary, or a higher salary, no com-pensation should be payable till retirement for age or disability not caused by mis-conduct. On retirement for either of these causes, compensation should be given for pre-State service, on the terms suggested herein, together with such pension, if any, as may have been earned in respect of State service.It will be for Parliament to determine whether the conditions of the State service are to be those of ordinary Civil Service, i.e., whether retirement on pension of such men as are taken into the service of the State will be allowed before the age of sixty. If that concession is made, the compensation in respect of pre-State service should reckon from the date of retirement.If a person is employed by the State at a rate of pay lower than that formerly enjoyed, he should be compensated in respect of the difference as if this difference had been the amount of his salary and he had not been employed by the State.No compensation by way of annual pension should be paid in any case unless a person has served for. ten years.61. Subject to these reservations we make the following recommendations : (a) The Technical Staff of Brewers and Malsters and, possibly, to some extent, of Distillers, comprising Operative Br.ewers, Operative Malsters, Chemists, Engi-neers, etc., is composed of men who have had to acquire specialized knowledge to fit them for their particular duties, and have also had to serve an apprenticeship of about thr.ee years, paying fees and not earning any salary, their whole training-costing a considerable amount of money. They then devote themselves to their particular branch of the work, and many of them ultimately receive large salaries. Their terms of employment are generally fixed by agreement, and are usually by the year or for a term of years. If the State purchases the businesses they would be quite willing to continue their services on the same terms. But, they sav, if their, services are dispensed with there will be no longer any other employer,&quot; and their training will not fit them for other employment in which they could&quot; hope to secure the same income, and the time and money spent in fitting them for their present employment will have been lost. They ask that treatment similar to that pro-vided in the Metropolis Water Act, 1902, and the Port of London Act of 1908, with certain modifications, should be secured.to them. We think that this puts&apos;their claim too high and that compensation on the following scale would probably be sufficient: If still an apprentice, any apprentice fee paid to be allowed, and further reasonable expenses incurred in learning the business, to be in the discretion of the Tribunal.For those who are fully qualified, who have served for less than ten years, a gratuity of one-twelfth of their salary for. each year&apos;s service.For those who have ten years&apos; service or more, an annuity or pension computed on one-eightieth of their average annual salary for the three years before their services are discontinued for every year&apos;s service, but not exceeding, in any case, one-half such annual salary.(b) Directors of Companies who have served three years or less should we think, receive one year of their remuneration in cash; for more than three, and less than seven years, two years; and for more than seven, three years. A Managing-Director to be compensated, in addition, under (c) in respectof that portion of his salary which is in excess of the remuneration of an ordinary-director.
(c) Managers and other officials, for whom a specialized training, such as required bv the technical staff, is not necessary, but whose terms of employment are somewhat similar and whose experience and knowledge could be more easily adapted to work in connection with other business, shculd. where they have served less than-ten years, receive a gratuity of one-fifteenth of their average salary for the three preceding years in respect of each year they have served. Where they have served ten years or&apos; over; we consider that they should be compensated by a pension equivalent to one-hundredth of their salary, averaged for the preceding there years, but in no case to exceed one-third of their average salary for the three years for every year&apos;s service, or, at their option, a cash payment of the value of this annuity.(d) Publicans&apos; Assistants and Shopmen. These are employed upon terms which enable their employers to terminate the employment, in many cases, without any previous notice being&quot; given; in other, cases on a week&apos;s notice, and in a limited number of cases on receiving a months notice. Where the employer carries on other businesses in conjunction with the liquor trade, their services usually extend to these other businesses as well as to the liquor business, and, therefore., they would probably be retained by their employers where they were only parting with the liquor end of their trade. Very exaggerated claims w7ere put forward oh their behalf, but we consider that they would be adequately dealt with by giving those of them who had served not more than twro years a sum equivalent to one month&apos;s salary, to be increased by a fortnights salary for every additional year of service.(e) Vanmen, Yardmen, Labourers, etc., can be dismissed on a wreek&apos;s notice, require no special skill or training, and can easily get other similar employment. They should get a cash payment equivalent to a week&apos;s wages for every year they have served.(/) Some manufacturers have agents for particular districts who are paid by commission on their sales. The services of these agents might be retained by the State to manage distribution in these areas on terms of remuneration similar to those at present existing. But, if that cannot be arranged, the Tribunal should deal with each such case upon its merits and award some reasonable compensation. We have not sufficient information to enable us to suggest the basis upon which this should be made beyond a consideration of their profits and expenses, the terms of their commission, the prospect of its continuance or termination, and the fact that the time and exertion given to it will no longer be required.TRIBUNAL.62. We recommend that a Tribunal should be constituted to deal with fixing the amount of compensation and all other questions arising in reference to the purchase and transfer of the property, and adjusting the claims of all persons having superior interests in the lands and premises acquired or having mortgages or charges (including debentures) upon them or upon any other property of the Vendors.63. The Tribunal should consist of five members and should include at least, one lawyer, one accountant, and one business man. All should be independent of the parties and of the interests to be dealt with, and should be men of standing and experience.The Tribunal should have full power to call for and examine all books and accounts relating to the businesses, and to inspect all premises, plant, machinery, stock, etc., and to procure such skilled assistance as they might require.They should also have power to ascertain the views of the owners of the various interests and to negotiate with them; and, if an agreement is arrived at, the owner should be paid all reasonable costs incurred by him up&apos;to that date. If an agreement is not arrived at, the Tribunal should hear the case of the owners and the answrer of the purchasers and decide the matter, the cost of such hearing to be in the discretion of the Tribunal. Their decision upon all questions of fact and amounts to be final. But, if required to do so by either, party, they should, upon any question of law, state a case for the King&apos;s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland, and the decision of that Court upon the question of law so stated should be final. The necessary costs of making Title should be borne by the State.Save as aforesaid, the costs and expenses of and incurred by the Tribunal should be borne and paid by the State.
MODE IN WHICH PAYMENT SHOULD BE MADE.64. We have not had evidence from any financial experts on this matter, and we therefore hesitate to express an opinion. We assume it will be dealt with fully bv the English Committee who have had important evidence on the subject. We may, however, make the following suggestions : In addition to cases in which persons entitled to annuities or pensions are given the option of having an equivalent payment in cash, we think that where the amount awarded does not exceed  500 it should be paid in cash.For the other payments we think Stock should be created on a 4 per cent, basis repayable at par in say, thirty years, charged upon the entire property of the Liquor Trade acquired in the United Kingdom and guaranteed by the State.The terms upon which the Stock should be issued should, we think, be carefully considered by financial experts. No doubt before the War it would have been more than equal to cash. It would not be so now and there may be still further changes in its value before the transaction is completed. If the transaction had been completed and the Stock issued before the War it would have depre-ciated ,in value, but it might have been, in whole or in part, disposed of by the owners and the proceeds invested in some business or security which might not have depreciated so much or which might in fact have become more or perhaps less valuable. That the owners have not had the opportunity of doing this should, we think, be taken into account, Apart from this general question there are two matters which we think require to be dealt with specially.(1) The owners must pay their ordinary trade debts in cash.(2) They could sell their, stock-in-trade for cash.To the extent of these two items, we consider the payment should be in an amount of Stock equivalent to cash.CONTROL.65. If the Government decides to purchase the Liquor Trade or any branches of it, and also decides upon the basis upon which the purchase is to be made and the methods of ascertaining the price, and has these matters fixed and determined by Statutory Provision, then, we think, if Control is to be put into operation, it could be effected, at all events so far as the Distillers, Brewers, Merchants, and Malsters are concerned, by arranging with the present owners to carry on their respectives businesses for the State and subject to its direction, guaranteeing to them their averag profits estimated on a definite period prior to the War, and paid half-yearly, with a percentage upon any additional profits made by them so as to ensure that their best efforts would be given to the business.We do not think that this would be a satisfactory arrangement in reference to all public houses and off-licenses. It might be applied to a certain selected number in each district. As to the others, it would be better that they should be closed or their business discontinued until the purchase is completed, even at the expense of making, in the meantime, half-yearly payments to the owners on the basis of an estimate of their, average net profits for a definite period prior to the War. These amounts to be adjusted when the true annual net profits are ascer-tained and the purchase is completed. In our view, in these cases, the best solution is immediate purchase.SUMMARY   OF   RECOMMENDATIONS.66. These recommendations are given in the order in which they are made.1. Distillers should be purchased upon the basis of acquiring the fee-simple, free from incumbrances, of all lands and buildings used by the owners for the purposes of their businesses and all other property used in or directly connected with their business, also free from all charges (Par. 25).2. The average annual net profits of each concern for the five years prior to the War should be ascertained as set out in Par. 26.3: A certain number, of years&apos; purchase (we suggest twelve years as a standard for a high class concern, Par. 30) should be given for the entire lands, buildings, machinery, plant, fittings, fixtur.es, good-will, and every other property and interest used in or necessary for carrying on the business, exclu-sive of book debts, reserve funds (where separately invested) and&apos; the Stock manufactured or unmanufactured.
4. The book debts and invested reserve funds to remain the property of the owner, and the Stock to be taken over by the purchaser at a price to be agreed upon, or, failing agreement, to be fixed by the Tribunal; the question of excess war profits to be taken into account (Par. 26).5. The purchasers to take over all existing contracts and to indemnify the Vendors in respect of these (Par. 26).6. All liabilities except ordinary debts to be ascertained on a pre-war basis (Par. 29). &apos;     ; .7. Legislative provision should be made that, so far as Debentures and Debenture Stock are concerned, the sale and purchase should not be treated as a winding-up of the company, but the amounts to which the Debenture Holders would be entitled should be determined by the Tribunal, unless agreed upon by the parties interested (Par. 29).8. P^ecommendations in the case of the Brewers similar to those recom-mended in the case of the Distillers, except that thirteen years of the net profits should be substituted for twelve years (Par. 34).9. Brewers&apos; tied houses should not be included in the property purchased for a definite number of years of the net profits. But should be acquired on the same basis as &quot;On &quot; licensed public houses. The amount of compensation to be divided amongst the parties interested in proportion to the value of their respective interests (Par. 35).10. Malting carried on by Brewers, whether for their own use or. for sale, should be treated as part of the business to be acquired, and the premises used for. this purpose as part of the brewery premises (Par. 36).11. Where mineral water manufacture is carried on by brewers as a separate business and upon premises separate from the brewery premises it is not necessary that it should be acquired, but brewers may be entitled to some compensation on account of the additional cost of carrying it on as a separate concern (Par. 37).12. When it is carried on on the premises to be acquired by the State, it . should be treated as part of the entire business, regard being bad to this by the Tribunal when fixing the number of years&apos; purchase (Par. 37).13. If the manufacturing and retail branches of the Trade are purchased the interests of wholesale merchants, bottlers (except perhaps one large firm whose trade is almost exclusively confined to export to foreign countries) and blenders should be acquired on the same terms as those recommended in case of the &quot; Off License &quot; Holder (Pars. 39 and 40).14. We recommend the following basis of purchase of public houses (Par.A. Where the publican wishes to sell his interest in the premises in which he carries on his business, or the State wishes to acquire it: (a) The value of the fee-simple, free from incumbrances, should be ascer-tained by the Tribunal, and out of this fund all superior interests should be redeemed and all incumbrances paid, the superior interests to be valued by the Tribunal.(b) The publican should be paid the value of his fixtures and fittings and also of his stock of liquor when taken over; as to the latter, subject to excess War profits if applicable. .    &apos;&apos;(c) A number of years&apos; purchase of his net profits from the liquor businessascertained on an average of three or five (at the option of the Tribunal) years&apos; trading next prior to the War. We do not fix the number of years&apos; purchase, but we suggest seven.
B. Where the publican does not wish to sell his interest in the premises and the State does not wish to acquire it (b) and (c) will apply.C. Where the publican himself or members of his famliy conduct the business, in ascertaining the true net profits, a deduction should be made for their services, and the person or persons rendering them could be com-pensated for loss of service on such terms as the Tribunal may think reason-able; or(1) The Tribunal might make no deduction from the profits in respect of these services and give a smaller number of years5 purchase of the net profits without such deduction, which would on that basis include the value of the services; or(2) they might ascertain the average net profits on sales of drink in the district, apply this to the average sales in the particular case, and give such number of years&apos; purchase of this profit as the Tribunal should consider sufficient to include compensation for such services (Par. 40).15. &quot;Off&quot; License Holders and Spirit Grocers should be dealt with on the same basis as the &quot; On &quot; License Publicans, but five years should be substi-tuted for seven years of the net profits (Par. 51).16. We do not think it necessary that the interests of hotels and restaurants in the sale of drink should be acquired; but where they have bars mainly used for the sale of drink these should be acquired upon the same basis as the &quot; On &quot; Licensed Publicans&apos; interest, or they should be wholly dis-continued (Par, 52).17. We do not think it necessary to acquire the liquor interest in Theatres, Places of Entertainment, Railway Refreshment Rooms, Steamboats or Clubs; but we make recommendations for their supervision (Pars. 53-55).18. We think the only allied trade that need be dealt with is that of the Malsters (Par. 56).19. If the Brewers are purchased, and no arrangement is made with the Malsters for continuing their business, their interests should be purchased also on the basis of the fee-simple value of their lands and premises, free from incumbrances, and the value of their machinery, fixtures, plant and stock-in-trade and a certain number of years&apos; purchase (we suggest five as a standard) of their net annual profit, based on an average of five years prior to the War, for goodwill, compulsory purchase, etc.; the Tribunal to have full power to take into account any exceptional circumstances (Pars. 57 and 58).20. Where Employers had Pension Schemes, the Employees, losing employ-ment, should not be placed in a worse position by reason of the State taking over the property (Par. 59). Apart from this and subject to reservations mentioned in Par, 60 we recommend that persons losing employment should be compensated according to the Scale set out (Par. 61 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (/)).21. A Tribunal should be constituted consisting of five independent mem-bers, of whom at least one should be a lawyer, one an accountant, and one a business man, to deal with fixing the amount of compensation, and all other questions arising in reference to the purchase and transfer, of the property and adjustment of the claims of all persons.,having superior interests in the lands and premises acquired, etc. Their decision upon all questions of fact and amounts to be final; but, if required to do so by either party, they should state a case upon any question of law for the King&apos;s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland, and the decision of that Court should be final (Pars. 62 and 63).22. In addition to cases in which persons entitled to annuities or pensions are given the option of having an equivalent payment in cash, we think, that where the amount awarded does not exceed  500 it should be paid in cash.
JOHN GORDON.H. D. M. BARTON.M. A. ENNIS:   (See Reservations.)STANLEY HARRINGTON.ROBERT THOMPSON.M. F. HEADLAM.MAURICE E. DOCKRELL.THOMAS 0&apos;DONNELL.   (See Reservations.)W. T. SHERIDAN,Secretary. lQth January, 1918.23. For the other payments we think Stock should be created on a 4 per cent, basis, repayable at par, in (say) thirty years charged upon the entire property of the Liquor Trade acquired in the United Kingdom and guaranteed by the State (Par. 64).To the extent of the owners&apos; trade debts and stock-in-trade, payment should be in an amount of Stock equivalent to cash.24. On the assumption that the basis on which the purchase is to be made and the method of ascertaining the price has been fixed and determined by an Act of Parliament, we think control could be effected, so far as the Dis-tillers, Brewers, Merchants and Malsters are concerned, by arranging with the present owners to carry on their respective businesses for the State with a guarantee of their average net profits based on five years next before the war, and a percentage upon any additional profits earned (Par. 65).25. This system might be applied to a certain number of public houses in each district. As to the others, it would be better that they should be closed or their business discontinued until the purchase is completed, even at the expense of paying them similar estimated net profits (Par. 65).We desire to express our high appreciation of the services which our Secretary has rendered throughout the enquiry.
SUGGESTIONSfor theReduction of the member of Licensed Public Houses in Ireland should the scheme of State Purchase of the whole of the Liquor Trade not be proceeded with.Although not coming within the scope of the Reference to them, the Com-mittee unanimously desire to suggest that if the contemplated State Purchase and Control should not for any reason be carried out, it would be most desirable from every point of view that some scheme should be provided by which the number of Licensed Public Houses in Ireland would be substantially diminished. They would suggest by at least one-half.There are in Ireland 16,396 houses licensed for the sale of Spirits to be con-surned on the premises, and 283 for the sale of Beer to be consumed on the premises, or one for every 263 of the inhabitants of the country. In England and Wales the total number is 86,722, or one for every 415 of the inhabitants, and in Scotland 6,841, or. one for every 695 of the inhabitants.To reduce the number, in Ireland would be. a great social advantage, and would greatly lessen the labour of supervision by the Police. Almost all the witnesses engaged in the Trade were strongly in favour of such reduction, and stated that, in their opinion, the owners of the remaining public houses would willingly contribute to the cost.The Committee suggest that a Tribunal should be appointed to determine the particular houses in each district the liquor business in which should be acquired for the purpose of extinction, and it should be given power to treat with the owners as to terms, and, failing agreement, to fix the terms upon which these interests should be acquired. Preferably the licenses attached to houses in which grocery, provision or drapery businesses are caried on should be selected for extinction.The Committee think that an amount equivalent to the whole or at all events to the greater part, of the amount required for the purchase could be raised, by a special charge, upon the amount of drink sold by each of the remaining publicans, of Is. per Barrel on Beer and Is. per Gallon on Spirits. This might be collected by a system of stamps to be paid for by them and affixed to their receipts for goods purchased. Or if thought more desirable, the Tribunal might fix an amount proportioned to his profits to be paid by each of the remaining publicans.The funds produced to be managed by the Tribunal, or the State, and applied towards the payment of interest and to create a sinking fund to pay off the whole, or a large portion of the amount advanced for purchase. The majority of the Com-mittee think that the balance (if any) would be well expended by the State in getting rid of such a large number of superfluous public houses. In view of the immediate nature of the problem the State should in the first instance provide the money and pay the cost of purchase, and should pay all expenses of the Tribunal and of working out the scheme. We do not enter into full details, but we earnestly desire that this suggestion should receive careful and favourable consideration.&apos;Mr. Headlam is of opinion that the State should not ultimately bear any part of the cost of purchase, but subject to this reservation, he joins with the other members of the Committee in signing this Suggestion.JOHN GORDON.

RESERVATIONS  BY  MR.   M.   A.   ENNIS,As the terms of Reference are in my opinion capable of divergent interpretations upon a point of considerable importance I desire to elucidate herein my conception of their true reading on this point, and to state the fact that my signature to the Report is based upon this conception.That portion of the Reference dealing with control of the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic liquors in Ireland during the war I regard as falling within the category of urgent war measures exemplified by State control of Railways and various other forms of centralised authority presumably terminating concurrently with the extinction of the cause from which they spring.My difficulty arises when I come to consider a present agreement for purchase of Liquor Trade interests involving capital liabilities of great magnitude in view of the facts.(a) That the date of fruition of the proposed purchase is necessarily indicated by a somewhat vague and nebulous formula.(b) That whether the interval between agreement and purchase be long or short the law provides for a vital change in the Government of Ireland during that par-ticular interval.(c) And therefore that the ultimate purchaser the Irish State cannot be a direct party to present negotiations. It may be urged that the intention underlying the Reference is an unified control and purchase of the Liquor Trade of the United Kingdom by the Imperial State, but the appointment of three separate Committees would seem to indicate recognition of the necessity for divergent treatment within separate areas.In my view I am clearly not entitled to forecast any possible or probable changes in the Irish Constitution I must study this problem from the point of view of the existing law.The existing law is embodied in the Government of Ireland Act, 1914, and the mandatory provisions of that Act contained in Section XXVI. which become ten-tatively operative on 31st March, 1918.I am not prepared to assume either desire or intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to emasculate the incoming Irish Parliament created by that Act by utilising the suspensory period to withdraw from it powers vital to efficient self-government.Such a Parliament deprived of effective control of Irish land, Irish Railways, Irish roads, Irish forests, and the Irish Medical Service would obviously be an im-potent body wielding only a negligible authority.In the absence of unfettered control hj the Irish Parliament of the manufacturing side of the Irish Liquor Trade 31 per cent, of Ireland&apos;s normal Revenue might at any moment be jeopardised by the arbitrary exercise by an outside authority of powers of control including extinction, transference, or dilution whilst on the dis-tributive side5 of the trade a Government charged with the maintenanc of lawr and order would be hampered by lack of authority to deal with a potent cause of disorder.I recognise that effective control by the Irish State involves purchase by the Irish State, and I therefore suggest as a variant of the terms proposed in Par. 64 of the Report that all payments should be made in Irish Excise Stock issued at par, carrying 4 per cent, interest free of Income Tax, forming a first charge on Irish Excise Revenue, redeemable in ten, and repayable at par in thirty years from date of issue.
I assume that the obligation to purchase contemplated by the terms of Reference would arise only in the event of manifest injury to the commercial interests of the Concerns controlled. My view of the situation as disclosed by the evidence taken by the Committee is that in the case of the large manufacturing firms diminution of output has not led to diminution of profit, and that the .dividend-paymg capacity of these firms has not been injuriously affected.In these circumstances and in view of the desirability of safeguarding the Irish Treasury from excessive commitments in the initial stages of its career I venture to express the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government may find it possible to avoid purchase of the manufacturing branch of the Irish. Liquor Trade, and to accept instead the alternative suggestions contained in the addendum to the Report the handling of which would present no difficulty to the Irish Exchequer.M. A. ENNIS.
RESERVATIONS AND MEMORANDUM BY MR, THOMAS 0&apos;DONNELL,- M.P..While agreeing with my colleagues in their principal findings, I regret to find myself in disagreement with them on two questions (a) The net profits of public houses; (b) The price to be paid for the Publican&apos;s Interest. These two questions are dealt with in paragraphs 47 and 49 of the principal report.Net Profits.The true net income from the sale of drink in public houses in Ireland is a matter impossible of accurate ascertainment by a Commission such as ours. The best that can be done is, with the figures at our disposal, to make a rough estimate. My colleagues fix the gross profit on the sale of all classes of beer. bottled and draught at 15s. per barrel. This I consider too low, and I estimate that 18s. per barrel would be nearer the actual figure. I cannot accept their figures as regards the gross profit on wine, which I estimate at 10s. per gallon, nor as regards minerals, on which I estimate publicans have a total annual gross profit of at least  100,000.I estimate that of the drink sold each year in the country the publicans sell seven.eighths of the beer and spirits, and at least one-half of the wine..On these figures the pross profits of publicans would be on spirits  1,378,125, on beer  2,205,000, on wine  275,000, on minerals  100,000, making a total gross profit per. annum of  3,958,125. Of this I estimate that 40 per cent, would be net profit, making a total annual net profit for Irish publicans of  1,583,000.The finding of the true net profits of each individual publican will have to be determined more accurately when the purchase is being carried through by Tribunal Officers.Purchase Price.The other question on which I find myself compelled to disagree with my colleagues is the price to be paid for. the publican&apos;s interest in the license. They suggest seven years&apos; purchase of the net income as the maximum price to be paid, or, roughly, about seven millions for the whole of the Irish publicans&apos; interest in their licenses. This I consider an inadequate and, when the special circumstances of Ireland are taken into account, an inequitable sum. There are, in Ireland 10,500 families making their living mainly by the sale of drink. That this number is too large nobody will deny when we consider, that Scotland, with a much larger population and with double the wealth, has only 6,400 publicans. To reduce the number of publicans is not only the right, but in this case seems, the urgent duty of the State. The peculiar condition of Ireland has, however, to be carefully con-si dered, and when we are effecting a great social reform we must be careful not unduly to inflict hardship or injustice on individuals, even though we dislike the trade they carry on and are satisfied it is injurious to the national well-being.In Ireland, as already explained, under the existing law there is fixity of tenure in licenses which does not apply in either England or Scotland. Acting on this public security men have invested their capital in the business, they have given their time and their energies to it, they regard it as well-secured property for their families. It is to three-fourths of them their principal means of livelihood. Another, factor has also to be taken into account. Ireland is far f rom being in a normal condition industrially. The very existence of 16,500 public houses, or one for every fifty families, is of itself the saddest and most convincing proof of this, as, if other fields were open in their own country to our, young men, very few of them would, from choice, adopt the career of publican. Regret and deplore it as we may. the fact has got to be admitted that in the stagnant industrial condition of our country very few opportunities are available for profitably using capital in other trades.Ireland, at least three-fourths of it, is mainly an agricultural country. Few of our smaller towns have industries of any importance, while, unfortunately, they all have far. too large a number of public houses. It may afford interesting pastime for the mere critic to apportion blame for this regrettable conditon of affairs. It is, however, the duty of the Statesman who wants to achieve reforms to recognise existing conditions, to face facts as they are in.a modern, practical and sympatheticE
spir.it. Dealing- with the Irish Drink Problem in this spirit we must, recognse that when men&apos;s licenses are taken from them very few., if any, other avenues of employment are open to themselves and their families. This, to my mind, is the great outstanding difficulty specially peculiar to Ireland. It makes the problem more difficult than in England or Scotland, but it also shows the great need for immediate and effective steps being taken towards carrying out the alternative scheme suggested on broad and generous lines.In arriving at a figure which would be reasonable we must be guided by the prices paid for the extinction of licenses in England under the Act of 1904. Under this Act a certain number of licenses has been extinguished annually, a compen-sation fund created, all licensees paying into it. In the year 1906, two licensees, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation awarded them on the extinction of their licenses, appealed to the High Court and were awarded, in the first case, ten years&apos; purchase of their profits and three years&apos; purchase of the rent of the premises, and in the second case, eleven years&apos; purchase of profits with ten years&apos; purchase of the rent. In addition to giving ten and eleven years&apos; purchase on profits it will be seen that a further sum was given as compensation for the reduced letting value of the house after, the license was taken away.Taking into account all these factors which I have mentioned and for a feasible or equitable solution of this problem, they cannot be ignored I am forced to the conclusion that when a man&apos;s license is taken from him the figures awarded in England would be a much fairer guide to be taken by the Tribunal than those given by my colleagues.Alternative Scheme.The: alternative scheme of purchase which we have unanimously adopted seems to offer a splendid opportunity of at least making a beginning in dealing with the drink evil in Ireland. This scheme proposes to buy up at least half the Irish public houses, the compensation, in the main, to be paid by those who remain. The amount of the compensation payable in each case is to be determined by the Tribunal which it is proposed to set up. It may cost four or five millions, but will be prac-tically self-supporting, involving the State in little or no financial liability, while doing the community incalculable service. The publicans themselves, as shown in the evidence which they gave, are whole-heartedly in favour of it. To carry out such a scheme would, to my mind, be a national blessing, and in order to achieve it I feel we should not deal in a paltry or niggardly spirit with those whose licenses are being taken from them. The &quot;drink traffic as it exists in Ireland to day is one of the most serious hindrances to national progress. To lessen its ravages, to confine and limit its evil influence in the manner suggested in the alternative scheme would be such a great national blessing that nothing should be done which could even remotely arouse fears of injustice or unfair treatment in the minds of the publicans. The human wrecks, physical and moral, wdiich one sees in our cities and towns, the ruined homes, the squalor poverty and decay, the neglected, underfed and diseased children, all present a spectacle calling for immediate and radical treatment by a drastic extinction of small, badly-kept, isolated and remote public houses, and by proper supervision and management of those that remainTo achieve any great reform we must carry the public conscience with us. There must not be the slightest trace of injustice. While we wish to mitigate a great evil for the benefit of the community we must not do so at the expense of those who have carried on the business for generations with the sanction and approval of the State. So anxious am I to see this alternative scheme carried through, that not only would I give the publican just compensation, but I would even go a little further in the hope of making this scheme a success. I would give a free hand to the Tribunal which is to be set up to deal with each case on its merits. A rigid uniform figure would be bound to operate unjustly in the variety of widely differing cases that: will nave to be dealt with.Subject to the foregoing reservations, I agree with my colleagues..
