General Federation of^Tradeoffipns^to^ the Prime aiinlsterATHE GENERAL FEDERATION Of TRADE UNIONS. Hamilton House,Bidborough Street, London, *v.C.18th January, 1918.Dear ilr. Lloyd George,The Joint Committee of the House of Lords, the House of Commons and the General Federation of Trade Unions which has been working in connection with Sailors1 end Soldiers1 pay, and which you met some little time since, is again in trouble over tho equalisation of separation allowances as between the Navy and the Army..You know from past experiences that their intention is not to embarrass the Government, but to remove injustices that are obvious and that create grave discontent^It is the unanimous feeling of the Committee that a conversation such as we held before leads to happier results than propaganda in the country or interrogation in Parliament, and for this reason they desire me to write and ask that you will see them at the earliest possible date in order to dis-cuss the points raised in the appended memorandum and letter.The Committee aro encouraged to hope that happy resultc will follow from such a conference because the money . cost of the reform is very slight as compared with that involved in the increase of pay., and because they feel that a portion of this at least may&quot;bo saved &quot;fry the simplification of administration that will follow the equalisation of separation allowances..Tho Committee are anxious to meat you as soon as possible and I add my own personal appeal to the request for an early meeting because, as you know, I have promised to go to jiiaerica and I am most anxious to koap in touch with this movement in order to assist in keeping it within the bounds of possibility.Yours faithfully, (Signed)     W. A. APPLETON.
The object of the interview which the Sailors&apos; and So-liLleTs&apos; Pay CommiJ&amp;l^e-e&apos; is requesting, is to call the attention of the Prime Minister to the urgent necessity for equalising the rate of separation, allowances issuable to the wives and dependents of sailors and marines to that at preeent payable under the War Office.The Committee has gone very closely into this question and they cannot find any justification for this differential treatment of th$ two Services.The inequality of payment falls very hardly on the wives and dependents of men on Uavy rates, causes much unnecessary trouble to T,Vsr Pensions Committees and Local Associstions end creates much dissatisfaction in the country from the fact that the wife or dependent of tho sailor or marine receives a far smaller emount than the man in the Army, whereas both men are equally risking their lives for their country.To demonstrate this inequality, it is only necessary to point to the lower rates of separation allowances issued to the wives and dependents of men in the flavy, where in spite of the fact that even with the recent concession, 1/6 is compul-sorily deducted from the pay, and also that in the case of flavy dependents the amount payable by the State, however much is assessed by the Pensions Officers and Committees, is always limited in the case of short service men by the fact that the Admiralty will not pay more than half the dependency, end in the case of long service men by that fact, and it is again limited by the regulations which refuse payment of more than half the,, amount of the -allotment.. .     .. ^To demonstrate tho position which arises in many cases which apply to the two Services, the case of the Royal Marine can be taken, who; whilst he is on shore is under Army Separa-tion allowances.     When on ships1 books he is under Navy scparc tion allowances and his w.ifo or &quot;dependants are thereby deprived ,of some very necessary shillings per week.r        In view of the &quot;ever increasing cost of living, it is considered that the rates of separation allowances for the Wavy should at least equal, and not be considerably less than thOBe of the Army.There is also considerable complaint amongst those in receipt of Navy separation allowances with regard to the arbitrary methods of jurisdiction adopted by the officials of the Admiralty.     The&quot; rules for the administration of separation allowances, while approved by the Board of the Admiralty, are actually drawn up by the Accountant General of the Ifavy, which department deal3 with all individual cases, interprets the intentions of the Acts and Orders in connection with these allowances, and in oases of appeal, again deals with the questions which arise.Many esses have come to the knowledge of the Committee, one of which is appended, in which it is felt that less than justice has been administered, and it is considered that some Court of Appeal, composed partly of Service Officers, who naturally are in closer touch with the men themselves than any civilian can be, should be ttat up;   to which Court of Appes cases of hardship or cases in which there is disagreement betwe Pensions Officers and Pensions Committees could be sent and decided.
- 3 -III..Coo,7 of Istter from the JSejsrejterj^^ndcn JTar mittce jjo&quot; the Secretary^ Gen era .1*&quot;jTedora^uOn^px - Trade43 Bloomsbury Square, W,C, 1.17th January, 1918.   -Dear Mr. Appleton,Sir Charles Nicholson tells me that stops are being taken by a Parliamentary Committee to make representations on the difference of. treatment to de-pendants of soldiers and sailors.     I can only say that I am thankful to hear it, for I think that Haval dependants are abominably treated in various ways.Sir Charles asks me to send you particulars of the case of a Mrs. Sandwell, and if you can have justice done to this wretched woman I. shall indeed be thankful,   iarse Sandwell is the wife of Beanie Sandwell, Engine Room Artificer. Fcyal liavy. The man deserted her in December 1213, ana she obtained a Maintenance Order of tZ a week for herself and two children; this Order was not paid In full, but the payments made averaged out at a  1. to  1.10,0 weekly,When the man joined the Usvy he could not avoid making the compulsory allotment of 5/- a week, but because he did not make the maximum allotment possible for him, the Admiralty refused any allowance to the woman.She was kept privately by various people who felt strongly about the ease for over a year; then, alas, it simply was not possible in view of the many claims upon one to con-tinue this, and poor Mrso Sandwell is actually in receipt of Poor Law relief/Sow my grievance is this4 if Sandwell had joined the Army instead of the Uavy, the compulsory, allotment of 3/6da coupled with the fact that he had contributed tc her support fairly regularly, would have enabled us to ohtoin for her the amount of that support within the limits of separation allowance, whilst in any case the three legitimate children would have been entitled to separation allowance.   In other words, at the present rates Mrs* Sandwell could have had the same as previously. In the flevy the position is different.I have contended all along that the Admiralty having deprived the woman of her only weapon, namely the power of susing tho man, should either force him to make the maximum allotment which would be 30/- a week, or if they will not do that should accept responsibility in the same way as the Army does, - - )Mrs. Sandwell has had a dreadful struggle and has been most plucky.     She has broken down in health now and cannot work, and I think it is a perfect scandal that she should be forced to accept Poor Lav/ relief.If you require further details either on this case or with regard to general procedure I will gladly give them to you.I am afraid I wax rather vehemently over the matter, but I do feel so av^fully strongly about it.     I have triedPensiqia Com-v Fii-.cnSo
tvery channel I can think of to secure help for Mrs, Sandwell, but on some technicality every door, is shut against her.-. Yours sincerely,(Signed)     2THSL M. WOOD.Secretary.. Apple ton,&apos; Esq.-, Hamilton House,Bidborough Street, Judd Street,
