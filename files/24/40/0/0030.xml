m&amp; *fixVVG R E T, 3430.(This Document is the Property ofHis Rrttanmo- Majesty&apos;s Gcvrrnment.)WAR CABINET.1COMMISSION INTERNATIONALE PB RAv1TAJLLEIj SNT position of British Executive jStaff(Memorandum by Mr. J. T.. Paries).[PRIME MINISTER,You will remember that Lord Robert Cecil wrote to you regarding the position of Sir Edmund Wyldbore Smith on the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement.   I have been making enquiries into the matter and beg to submit the following obser-vations:-The Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement was established in August 1914 to assist the Allied Governments in the purchase of material required for the prosecution of the Iwar, and to co-ordinate their purchases with those of His Majesty&apos;a Government,It was formed under the auspices of the then President of the Board of Trade, and the British Section of the Commiesion Internationale de Ravitaillement, which is in fact the executive organisation, was provided by the Board of Trade from a branch whose operations were automatically suspended upon the outbreak of war.It was essential that an organisation of this kind should have the support of some definite Department and the Board of Trade appeared to be at the time as convenient as any, since the functions of the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement were then principally confined to investigating sources of supply for certain commodities, arranging for trans-port facilities, carrying put the routine of export permits and the like, at the time when the military departments had not established their present control.It has, however, been felt for some time that the attachment of the Commissioh Internationale de Ravitaillement to the Board of Trade was neither appropriate nor convenient. In the first place practically all industries of any value to
the prosecution of the war have been taken under the control of the War Office, Ministry of Munitions or Admiralty, and supplies from these industries are considered from a purely military point of view.   Secondly the Foreign Delegates on the Commission have, it is believed, been inclined to resent the fact that the body responsible for controlling their war requirements was being in turn controlled by a purely commercial department, and they have undoubtedly formed the impression, however absurd it may seem,,  that such con-trol was being exercised with a view less to the effective provision of their war requirements than to the protection of British trade and its development after the war.In the third place the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement have not had the advantage, when faced with problems requiring a decision of higher authority than can be given by an individual Supply Department or involving the settlement of a point of dispute between two such Departments regarding Allied supplies, of having as Bponsor a Minister who could speak with authority on questions involving military and political and not commer-cial considerationsThe Director of the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement combines in practice the functions of (a) the agent or advocate of the Allies in regard to assistance required by them from His Majesty&apos;s Government in supply, tonnage and finance, (b) the mouthpiece of His Majesty^ Government in expressing their views and decisions to the Allies on questions of the suppljr of materials under their control,  (c) the repository of all Information and therefore necessarily to a certain extent the adviser of His Majesty1s Government regarding Allied GO ye rnment re qui rement s.On all Of these grounds it is essential that the Director of the Commission Internationale de Havitaillemont should have behind him the influence and authority of a Minister of recognised weight and.standing in councils dealing with questions of military and political, as dis-tinct from commercial,, importance.   At the same time it would be undesirable from the point of view of the Allies, and having regard to the diverse subjects dealt with by the.Commission,; that it should be attached to any single Department controlling the supply, finance or shipment of war materials&apos;.
Questions arise daily where the balance has to he struck between considerations of naval or military supply, supply o&amp; financial credit, financial credit or tonnage.   As a &quot;clearing house&quot; of   Allied requirements the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement should have strictly impartial associations;, were the supplies concerned and the policy of their distribution of an exclusively military character, it might be suggested that the control of the Commission should rest with the Secretary of State for War, but considerations of finance of tonnage, of supplies for the 2Javy or civil population of the Allies are also involved, and the War Department is at the same time concerned not only with strategy, but also with the production and distribution of certain classes of supplies, large quantxtitjs of which they themselves consume,  and therefore might find it difficult to view the demands of the Allies absolutely impartially.   The same principle applies to the Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions, and to the Treasury and Ministry of Shipping in their respective spheres.The question eventually narrows itself down to one of relations between His Majesty!s Government and the Allied Governments on questions of supply, and it would accordingly seem to be essential that the British Executive Staff of the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement should be responsible to the Foreign Office, which is the only absolutely impartial Department from the Allies1 point of view.(Intd)     J.T.D.January 23rd, 1918.
