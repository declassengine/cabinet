REPORT relating to the War Work of the Eoard of Agriculture for Scotland for the week ending 23rd January, 1918.SMoD PKQDUCTIOff. (This Document is the Property of .^1 Agricultural Work.      His Britannic Majesty^^Gov^miemDuring the week a severe snowstorm took place throughout tland and completely stopped outside work.   Intense frost was ^^erienced in many districts, 3&amp;   being registered at several  aces.   A welcome thaw set in on the 19th instant and the enow as now almost entirely disappeared.   Some days must elapse however before ploughing oan be re-started.r1. Increased Cropping, 1918-The Board have had before them returns submitted by District Agricultural Executive Committees of acreages of additional cropping arranged by them for this year.   ^hile the returns are on the whole encouraging the Board are convinced that further efforts must be made before the total increased cultivation can be secured. They  have accordingly impressed upon Committees the necessity of reconsidering the whole question and they have suggested that, by indicating to each Parish the proportional amount expected from it of the total area asked from the district, a spirit of emulation might be aroused which would be helpful in obtaining the desired results.2. Utilisation of Grass Parks.The Board have informed Committees that they are now prepared to issue oompul3ory orders under Defence of tha Pealm Regulation 2 M (l)(a) for   the occupation of grass parks for gracing purposes where the Committees are satisfied that this is a necessary condi-tion of the execution of the programme for increased production. They have suggested that the settlement of the rent payable to the owners should be based on last year&apos;s rent and not on the average for the past three seasons as previously proposed.3. Labour - Working of Overtime.In oonnection with the appeal made by the Prime Minister to agricultural workers and emphasised by the Seoretary for Scotland in his speech of 8th January to the representatives of the District Agricultural Executive Committees in Scotland, the Board have requested Committees to recommend farmers and farm workers to agres to make the following arrangements:- ,(l) Daylight and weather permitting, so long as the War lasts, a full day&apos;s work should be worked on all Saturdays and on other week days work should be done for   one hour longer than the present customary hours of work;(2) All work done in excess of the present customary hours should be paid for as overtime at the rate of time and half (calculated on the cash wage to all classes of farm workers).4. Supply of Fertilisers.(a) Distribution of Superphosphate-Arrangements have been made whereby the Board in co-cperation. with a Committee of the Scottish Fertiliser Manufacturers1 Associa-, tion will deal with applications for Superphosphate from merchants and farmers in Scotland.   Such applications ,have-^previously been dealt with by the Phosphates and Potash Distribution Committee in London.   The Board have had a   meeting with the Manufacturers&apos; Committee and the basis on which such aj-plications will be granted has been satisfactorily arranged.(b) /
(b) Blast Furnace Flue Dust.It has now been definitely ascertained that   no Blast Sumace Flue Dust of a potash content sufficiently high to warrant collection and grading is available from Scottish works.   A meeting has been held with the Supplies Division of the Food Production Department,   London, and tentative arrangements have been made to obtain limited quantities of flue dust from the Forth of England for distribution in Scotland.5. Seed Testing.The congestion at the Board&apos;u Seed Testing Station still continues;   but so far as the available staff and equipment permit every effort is being made to expedite completion of the tests of samples sent in for analysis and to issue the relative reports to the seed merchants.   The total number of samples reoeived to date is 3228 and during the past week about 600 reports (interim and final) have been sent out.On the 16th instant the Board met representatives of the Scottish Seed Trade Association and disoueaed certain questions arising out of the,administration of the Testing of Seeds Order. The disoussion proved useful in settling oertain doubtful points of interpretation;   and various suggestions, made by the represen-tatives of the Seed Trade, have been noted for consideration when the question of amending the existing Order falls to be dealt with at the olose of the present season.6. V,fart Disease of Potatoes.Reference has been made in previous reports to the serious position which has arisen through   the spread in 1917 of Wart Disease of Potatoes.   Systematic inspeotion of all gardens and farms by officials of the Board or of Looal Authorities even in the infected areas is in present circumstances out of the question;and to a great extent, therefore, the Board must rely on the oo-operation of the faming community and the general public in locating oases of the disease.   A oopy of a oircular issued to the Press appealing to all classes to assist in this work is enclosed. The Board are glad to be able to report that in response to this appeal a number of oases of Wart Disease have already been reported and several applications for leaflets describing and illustrating the disease in its various phases have been received.   It is pro-posed to issue periodically similar appeals through the Press so that the serious nature of the disease and the duty of reporting its presence whenever it appears may be kept prominently before the general public.The Board have also had under consideration the question of the supply of seed potatoes of &quot;immune^ varieties to oooupiers of gardens, allotments and farms which have been scheduled under the V/art Disease Order.   In view cf the fairly abundant stocks of suoh potatoes and the fact that prloes have been fixed by the Food Controller it has been decided that so far as Scotland is oonoerned direct supply by the Board is not called for.   There should not in ordinary oircumstances be any great difficulty in obtaining the requisite supplies through the usual trade ohannels;   but with a view to bringing the buyer and purchaser together the Board are compiling a list of retail merchants who have stocks of immune varieties to sell.   Merchants are being invited to send in their names for   inclusion in this list which when completed will be cir-oulated to oooupiers of &quot;infeoted premises&quot;.Arrangements /
Arrangements have also &quot;been made for the issue of licences to ocoupiere of infected ground under which they will be permitted to plant potatoes this year provided they use for the purpose one of the immune varieties selected by the Board.   Similar arrangements have been made in previous seasons but a   new condition has been inserted in the undertaking which the ocoupier must give before a licence is issued, viz:- that the resultant crop must be &quot;rogued1&apos; in the month of July.   Details of the arrangement are given in the attached printed circular.7 * Corn Production Act. 1917. Formation of ^ages Committees.The present position regarding the formation of Wagoe Committees in Scotland in terms of Part II of the above Act is as follows:-(a) Committees Certified - Lothiane and Peebles, Forfar and Perth.(b) Committees now being advertised in Press - Northern Counties (standing Sub-Committees for Orkney, Caithness and Sutherland) Moray Firth, North Eastern Counties, Fife and Kinross, Border Counties, Dumfries and Galloway, Clyde and Forth.(o) Committees in, course of formation - Ayr, South Eastern Highlands, and North Eastern Highlands, and Sub-Committee for Shetland.(b)Allotments.Cultivation of Lands (Scotland) Order 1918.The Board have revised their Cultivation of Lands 1917 Order which delegates to Town Counoils, subject to certain restrictions, the powers conferred on the Board by the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 L. as amended and a new Order for   1918 was issued on 4th January..   COLIDCTIOfl OF STATISTICS AMD RETURNS RELATING TO AGRICULTURE.The tabulation of the Returns for 4th January has now been completed, and a table is appended showing the estimated totals for this date ay compared with those returned on 4th June 1917 and with the estimates for 4th December 1917.    In the oase of cattle under one year a distinction is now made between oalveo under a month old and those over that age.*   RECRUITISO III iJGPICULTUREv.. MILITARY SERVICE ACTS 1916 .(a) The number of certificates issued by the Board in connection with the scheme for vouching agricultural workers in terms of A.C.I. 1175 (i.e. cases remitted by Recruiting Officers), is as follows:-Area:        Aberdeen........... 567Ayr................ 83-Berwick-on-Tweed... 1161Fort George........ 1601Glencorse... *.....* 951Hamilton........... 204Inverness.......... 418Perth.............. 690Stirling.......---- 427Total - 5900(b) The number of Certificates issued in terms of the Scottish Office Memorandum to Tribunals R.144 (i.e. oases remitted by Tribunals), is 784,
IV&apos;   TOCTS INSTITUTES.There are as yet few Institutes in Scotland working in co-operation with the Board.   These are well distributed however, being situated in the counties of Inverness, Perth, Fife and Banff, and the membership numbers are encouraging.   The Balbeggie Insti-tute has enrolled 84 members,  othiemay 42, FortV/illiani over 60.The work attempted so far has been on a very small soale, but it is hoped through the Institutes to reach the homes of the people in the remote parts of the country, and inculcate the special need for increasing and economising the food supply at the present time.   Vith this object in view, lectures, illustrated by maps, explaining the reason for the food scarcity are being given, and demonstrations on cookery have been encouraged in order that people   may be induced to make use of potatoes whenever possible.Poultry-keeping is a popular subject with the Institutes and arrangements have been made with the  forth and East of Scotland Colleges for the provision of expert lecturers.In order to stimulate local interest in such forms of work as the making of   comforts,   bandages, etc. the Board have put the Institutes into touch with the great voluntary organisations, who have assisted them by sending model specimens of work required, for exhibition at the Meetings.
IML DISEASE Off PQTATOl:The number.- of outbreaks of V7art Disease of Potatoes reported to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland during the past year discloses a serious, position regarding the spread cf this disease in certain districts of the country.It is the practice of the Board whenever an outbreak is reported to endeavour to discover the aause;    and, in a number of cases in 1917,  it has been proved that several areas previously clear of the disease have become infected through the distribution of diseased seed from one particular source.    If this process cf distribution is allowed to continue, the result may be disastrous to the Scottish potato trade.;    and it is of the utmost importance therefore that the Beard should be notified of every place where the disease exists in order that prompt steps may be taken to prevent it spreading to other areas.The Board rely on farmers and merchants, whose business it is to handle large quantities of potatoes, to notify outbreaks and to assist in every way possible in the location of diseased crops and affected land; but the general public, particularly at this season of the year, mayaSEader service in this direction in the f o11ow i ng ways* -1. Occupiers of gardens and allotments should carefully examine each tuber of their seed potatoes and report any suspected appearance of the disease to the Board *   This recommendation might also be adopted by farmers who, in their own interests, should examine a fairly large sample of their seed potatoes, tuber by tuber, to assure themselves that the seed is free from disease.2. Retailers of ware and seed potatoes should report any suspected occurrence on their stocks.3. Householders can also assist in the matter by reporting anyinstance of even the smallest trace of the disease on their household supplies of potatoes.The disease occurs as a warty mass, which may be small or large, at the eyes of the potato.    It is easily identified, but a descriptive and illustrated account of the disease in its various phases may be obtained by anyone on application to the Board. Reports sent to the Board should be accompanied by.a small specimen - a peeling containing the warty part will be sufficient - and all such reports will be regarded as strictly confidential.    The envelopes or packages containing specimens and reports should be addressed to the Secretary, Board of Agriculture for Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, and if sent by letter post, postage need not be pre-paid.
jBOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND.WART DISEASE OF POTATOES (SCOTLAND) ORDER OF 1913.Sir,The Board of Agriculture for Scotland desire to refer to the notice served upon you declaring certain land in your occupation to be &quot;infected premises&quot; within the meaning of the above Order, and to remind you that in terms of the notice &quot;No potatoes maybe planted on premises declared to be infected premises except potatoes authorised to be so planted by a licence granted by an inspector acting under the Order.&quot;Where no special part of a garden or other holding is mentioned in the notice, the whole garden or holding is &quot; infected premises,&quot; and no potatoes may be planted in any part of such premises without a licence.An application for a licence to plant potatoes must be made on the enclosed form, which, after the necessary particulars have been filled in, should be forwarded tonot later than the 30th day of April in the year in which it is proposed to plant the potatoes. Applications will only be considered when it is proposed to grow one or more of the following varieties Early Varieties. Al (Sutton), Eesistant Snowdrop (Dobbie), Edzell Blue.Second Early Varieties.-King George, Great Scot, The Duchess (Dobbie), The Ally, Entente Cordiale, Snowball.Maincrop Varieties. Burnhouse Beauty, Crofter, Favourite (Dobbie), Flourball, Golden Wonder, Irish Queen, Kerr&apos;s Pink, Langworthy, Majestic, Bob Roy, Schoolmaster, Sutton&apos;s Abundance, The Admiral, The Laird, The Lochar, The Provost, The Bector, The Templar, Twentieth Century, Whafs Wanted.The above varieties have been proved, after exhaustive experiments, to be resistant to the attacks of Wart Disease, and as the selection offered is fairly wide, the Board are not prepared to allow the planting in &quot;infected premises&quot; of any other varieties..Your attention is particularly directed to the undertaking which applicants for licences must give on the accompanying form in regard to the &quot; roguing &quot; of their crops. It sometimes happens that tubers from a previous crop are left in the ground, and shouldAg. 30.M &amp; G Ltd Wt 6207/184 1-18 7000 G. 2
2they not be of an immune variety the disease will, in all probability, be found on the resultant plants and tubers. The same thing may happen if the &quot; immune &quot; seed purchased by a grower contains one or more tubers of a susceptible variety. It is important, there-fore, that the plants produced by &quot;rogues&quot; in the seed or from &quot;self-sets&quot; or &quot;ground-keepers&quot; should be removed before the crop reaches maturity. Such plants are most easily detected in the month of July, as at that period of the season they should be distinguishable from the general crop by differences in the colour of their blooms, in the colour and shape of the leaves, and in the height and general appearance of the haulms or shaws. The Board attach great importance to the roguing of crops as a preventive against the spread of Wart Disease, and growers in view of the need for keeping their gardens clear of disease are strongly urged to destroy any plants which are obviously not of the variety for which a licence to plant has been granted.It will be noted also that before a licence can be granted, a declaration as to the purity of the seed must be furnished by the merchant from whom it is purchased. Occupiers of &quot; infected premises &quot; are strongly advised to buy their supplies from reliable and recognised potato merchants or growers; the practice of buying from general merchants or other persons who have no special knowledge of potatoes, and are not in a position to give a reliable guarantee as to the purity of their stocks, has been proved to be one of the chief causes of the continuance of Wart Disease in &quot; infected premises.&quot;The names of certain varieties of potatoes which are known to be very susceptible to the disease, are given below for the information of those who may have ground not scheduled under the Order, but suspected of being infected with the disease, or adjoining ground now declared to be &quot;infected premises&quot; : Arran Chief, Beauty of Hebron, British Queen, Dalhousie, Dalmeny Regent, Duke of York, Early Puritan, Eightyfold, Epicure, Evergood, Factor, Harbinger, Iron Duke, King Edward, Midlothian Early, Mighty Atom, Northern Star, President, Prolific, Scottish Farmer, Scottish Standard, Sharped Express, Sharpe&apos;s Yictor, Sir John Llewellyn, Skerry Blue, Table Talk, Triumph, Up to Date.While the planting in &quot;infected premises&quot; of any variety of potatoes except under licenoe constitutes a contravention of the Order, the Board must regard the unauthorised planting of any of the above susceptible varieties as a very serious offence.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Secretary.Board op Agriculture for Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square,Edinburgh, January 1918.
Y/ABT DISEASE OP POTATOES.The Board of Agriculture for Scotland hare had under consideration the question of the supply of seed potatoes of immune varieties to occupiers of gardens, allotments and farms which are infected with Wart Disease.   Although the stocks of these varieties in the country are fairly large, it would seem from enquiries received by the Board that intending growers are finding difficulty in purchasing the quantities they require. With a view to affording some guldahde :in the matter the Board propose to compile a list of retail Merchants who have stocks to sell and are prepared to supply the 6oeujtere pf land affected with Wart Disease on a reasonable guarantee that the potatoes so supplied are true to name and free from *roguesw.   The immune^ varieties for  which licences to plant will be granted are as follows 1*Early Varieties:   A 1 (Sutton), Resistant Snowdrop (Dobbie). Edsell Blue.Seopnd Early Varieties:   King George, Great Soot, The Duchess (Dobbie), The Ally, Entente Cordials, Snowball.Ma^norpp Varieties:   Burnhouse Beauty. Crofter, Eavourite (Dobbie), Elourball, Golden Wonder, Irish Queen, Kerrfs Pink, Langwortfcty, Majeatio, Hob Roy, Schoolmaster, Sufcton4s Abundance, The Admiral, The Laird, the Loohar, The Provost, The Rector, The Tomplar, Twentieth Century, Whafe Wanted.The guarantee whioh a merchant must give in supplying these potatoes is as follows:*&quot;I hereby undertake to supply the person named above with potatoes whioh are, to the beet of my knowledge, of the variety speoified, true to type, without the admixture of any &apos;ragues*.&quot;Meroh&amp;nta who wish to be included in the Board&apos;a list should make application ae eoon as possible to the Secretary, Board of Agrioulture for Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, stating the particular varieties which they have to sell.   The list, when completed, will be oirculated to all occupiers of infeoted land in Scotland.Board of Agriculture for Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square, EDINBURGH.     January., 1918.
