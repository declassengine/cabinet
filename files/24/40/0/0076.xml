December. (Var Cabjnet 298 (18), ;In the course of that discussion it was pointed out that these men h^d taken advantage of their statutory rights,  and were legally exempted from military service;    they were- retained in the Post Office a3 doing work of national importance only on the recommendation of the Tribunal concerned.    If their wages were reduced, the Trades Unions would claim that they were being sweated.    The difficulty of enforcing penalties now was aggravated by the lapse of time, as some of the men concerned had &quot;been receiving full pay for nearly 13 months. - - All. the men were skil-led,  and it would be very difficult to replace - them,I have recently discussed the matter with. ,phe Postmaster General, And I am informed by him that the decision referred to ha-3 given rise to unending complaints.    The amount of tension which ha? been caused   by the reduction in pay is altogether disproportionate to the importance of the matter, and. the num-bcr of men involved,  (which is less than one hundred).    The-Post-master himself is strongly of opinion that it would have been better to have let them remain as they were and that we might with advantage revert to the position \i it was prior to Dcc-e.uher 14th.The men concerned feel that they have a genuine grievance because they compare their position with that of ether conscion-tious objectors legally exempted by the Tribunal where no con-dition as to-their remaining in their previous occupation has been laid down.    In such cases the men concerned can make the best bargain open to them, and no one suggests that they should be penalised by reduction in their wa^cs;   bet in the case of Jlmen who have been previously employed in the Post Office,and who ha&quot;-, been, exempted conditionally upon their continuing their        \lm work of national importance, there is no alternative save to accept the reduction which has been ma.de following Y;-*r Cabinet&apos; &apos;:mdecision. &quot;-&apos; ,The/ I&apos; r- - III111 ! Hlf
Tho complaint is voiced at meetings where attempts are made to discredit the Government; and it has been pointed out to me that, although conscientious-objectors employed in Departments other than the Post Office may have bean penalised., there is no case in which a re-duction in their wages has been made some time after their exemption has been legally granted.I think the matter is o.ha which.!..should be rec considered by the Government, and&apos;I would suggest that the alternative course laid down in the hinute quoted above, (vis. that tho policy of the Postmaster General should be adopted), should ho. substituted for that which was actually taken, and that the Postmaster General should be authorised&apos;to reinstate the men concerned in the rate of wages which.they were drawing prior to the 31st. December 1917.&quot;..   &quot;[- *(SGD)G, H. DARhllS2,1/hitehall Gardens,s.w.iJanuary; 28th 1918.
