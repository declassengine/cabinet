I-,CSftJ,, ifIntelligence Bureau,ECRET.Department of Information, OSW/0O6.WEEKLY   REPORT   PIT   SWEDEN, vi. (Jan. S6th, 1918)Interest in Sweden has centred lately in the Finnish and Aaland Island Questions,     The recognition by Sweden of Finland as an in-dependent State took place in the first days of the current month and has done something to allay anxiety in Sweden and perhaps to render less difficult the solution of the Aaland Islands question with whioh Sweden is more intimately concerned.    The position is a simple one.These islands have to^s^y^been in the &quot;possession of Russia and are a perpetual menace to Sweden especially since they were, early in the war, garrisoned by Russian troops.     The islanders number about 25000 and are almost without exception of Swedish origin.    The question of the retrocession of the Islands to Sweden has been brought to c head by the action of the inhabitants who, on the ground of the right to decide their own destiny, assembled in their parishes and voted for union with Sweden.     They maintained that their commercial Interests wore connected with the Swedish coast along whioh they lie much mere than with the more distant one of Finland.     The Swedish point of view is that annexation to Sweden would be the most practi-oal solution as offering the surest guarantee that the Islands would not be fortified or used as a hostile base, thus constituting a perpetual menace and source of friction.     If the Islands became part of Sweden this would give satisfaction to a prosperous little commu-nity of Swedish speaking people whose ri^ht to self-determination neither Russia or Finland could deny, in the light of their reitera-ted declarations.The Swedish Press has shown a sincere desire,, in discussing thes question, not to offend national feeling in Finland or in Russia so
far as it may be said still to exist in the latter country.    In Russia it would not appear that any attention is being given at present to the ultimate ownership of the Islands.     In Finland parties are divided.     The large Swedish speaking population (338,961 in 1911) wou&amp;d deprecate the loss of numbers which the severance of the Islands would entail.     Some of the Finns on the contrary look more favourably on the projeot.    Among the Old Finns retention of the Islands is favoured.     In both oamps there are those who look upon the cession as an act of justice to the declared will of the inhabitants, besides being a judicious political move demanded by the necessities of the situation and by Sweden&apos;s not unjustified desire to safeguard her frontiers and get rid once for all of a constant menace.    A prominent Finnish Journalist, Herr Sundblom, argues that the cession of the Islands to Sweden is a natural corollary of Finland&apos;s independence equally based on the will of the people.     He suggests, and the idea seems to be a good one, that certain tracts of land above Tornea in Boroland where the inhabitants are Finns by language and race should be given In exchange.The Riksdag was opened,on Jan. 16th by King Gustaf.     H.M. referred to the united effort necessary tp counteract the effects of the war which bore more hardly than ever   upon Sweden.     He was resolved to maintain neutrality and with the aid of the other Scandinavian Kingdoms would continue the work of preparing for a permanent peace and a new international order.     His visit to Norway was&quot; e step tp-twafcds the unity of the HortH and he had re^ieed to see that- it was welcomed in Sweden.     The meeting-with his brother monarchy had extended and confirmed Scandinavian co-operation.     He hoped that Finland would soon join in the common work of peaoe and progress and that&quot; her independence would facilitate the solution of the Aaland Island question.     His i%jesty dealt at considerable length with the serious food problems now before the country and said that measures
,uld be laid before the Riksdag for increasing production.     Certain   i 1 itary-establishments were still necessary to secure the maintenance-neutrality but they have been reduced and if possible would be Iduced still further.     Cettain bills for the remeval of restrictionsparliamentary franchise, women&apos;s suffrage and equal communal bnchise would be introduced.    Also bills to increase the income and the tax on business entreprises.The   reduction of the Naval and Military estimates foreshadowed in [* King&apos;s speech are as follOwS:-Naval expenditure  2,418,750 this year against  3,937*500 in 1917. Army &quot;  5,681,250     ,f     &quot;        *         9,618,750   &quot;The successor to Mr. Bianting as Minister of Finance is Mr. Thorsscn,o is also a Socialist.     Htf has some experience in State finance andVice-President of his party.   He began life as a shoe-maker&apos;snrentioe and is stated to be the first member of the working-classeshas become a Cabinet Minister.    He is well-spoken of and is saidbe a man of groat ability and moderation.In a speech delivered on the last day of 1917 the prime Ministertcfessor Eden) characterised the economic situation as very serious, rationing policy of the &quot;Household Commission&quot; was based on the rvest statistics for July.     The hay harvest had been poor and only 1$ of the normal quantity ef fodder was available.     Wheat and rpe speotively shewed a deficiency of 300,000 and 400,000 tons.     The frn in hand would suffice for the holders of bread-cards till May ly.     The Government had sanctioned the export of 15,000 horses and was absolutely necessary for farmers to reduce their stocks   As garded unemployment there were a considerable number of stonemasons, Jxtile workers and builders 1 labourers out of work.     There was stiH sum of s*ven million Kronov (normally about  400,-000) available for eir relief, but further grants would be asked for if necessary.   The prernment were filly alive to the delicate position in which Sweden si
o -the- beliig4rents--and they were determined to pursue a policy of trict neutrality.    Their negotiations had been seriously prejudiced j the attitude of the Conservative Press.    1 contract for German oal for November and December had been concluded and that for anuary was under consideration.     Potatoes had also been obtained l&apos;rom Germany but no promise of any definite amount of corn.   Negotia-;ions with Washington led to no result and the delegation was sent to ondon.    He hoped that the Entente would not insist on impossible jonditions.The Peace Campaign continues spasmodically in the press.   Mr. rantingrs views as expressed by Social Democraten (Dec. 18) seem o be as follows ;-The Central Powers have accepted to a considerable extent the Jussian formula.     If the Entente Powers return a blunt refusal, the erman annexationists will use the rejection of this offer of peace s means of overcoming opposition to their plans.     The brutal efusal of passes to the Stockholm Conference which had as a conse-uence the collapse of Russia both from a military and oelitical point fview, was to be condemned
