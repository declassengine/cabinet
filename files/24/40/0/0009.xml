55-33 Empire House,175, Piccadilly, W.l. London-, 4th January, 1018,Dear Hr, Brandeis,The author of the enclosed Memorandum, Mr,James Einstein is a young American diplomats who has acquired, during his service in the Bast, an accurate and extensive insight into the affairs of Turkey, and its neighbouring.countries.   We made his acquaintance here in London some time ago and were pleased to find in him a friend of our cause, who is willing to offer his collaboration and good advice if he is consulted in the matter.   But this is not a question of personal introduction as the gentleman, in question is Independent and as far as his career is ooncerned, eng-oys the best reputation.   It is well, therefore,to call attention to the proper people who are sometimes overlooked,.Memorandum is of vital importance,.   It is most desirable that America should exercise a predominant influence in the solution of the questions of the Near East, and in this connection a declaration of war against Turkey by America would be very useful,. Mr, Einstein gives in a clear and convincing manner all his arguments in favour of such a declaration.   If you yourself should find, as I hope,&apos;this Memorandum worthy of consideration, may I suggest that you recommend it to the President?The matter with which Mr,Einstein deals in hisWith kindest regards,I remain, dear Mr,Brandeis,Yours sincerely,(Sgd,) N, Sokolow,per S,M,
PART.I,The arguments against declaring war on Turkey are &quot;believed to be based on the following grounds(l)   That it would strengthen the bond between Germany and her Eastern Ally.(2)   That it would render a separate peace more difficult.(3)   That it would be to the advantage of Germany at the time of the peace negotiations.(4)   That it would react unfavourably on Americans resident inTurkey and deprive these of the opportunity of extending relief to the Armenian survivors,(5)   That it Y/ould ramain a paper war.I. -To suppose that a declaration of war by America against Turkey would strengthen her bond with Germany is tc misapprehend the relations between the tv/o countries, v/hioh must go on un* changed whether or not we declare,war, .. Except for her jy^rruaJL-. -affairs where   she had been left  ree to murder^more than half of,a million of her Christian subjeots, Turkey offers only a label to a German name and the raw material to a German military command. With her Army and Navy under German direction, with the wreck of her finances under German control and subsidy, with her railroads and soanty industrial output under German management, and herself dependent on Germany for all her manufactured and military supplies, Turkey1s independence as a sovereign state is to-day-only a fiction,   A declaration of war by the United States oould not strengthen a bond which rests not on sentiment, often latently hostile to Germany, nor on a volition which has ceased to exist, but on necessity.   In its practical effect it could not add one soldier to the German forces.   Still less could it weaken the anti-German tarty for no such thing as party in our sense of the word exists In a country where public opinion is nil and where a submissive population is always ready to obey an effective executive force.   After three years of war. it is inconceivable that the union between Turkey and Germany oould be strengthened by our declaration of war,   But it might well be if any impression of allied dissension were to be given by our failure to do so,II,The assumption of a separate peace with Turkey is doubtless based on the idea that we, as the ally of the entente, by not declaring war might facii-itate such negotiations.   Apart from the desirability of a course which would leave unsettled some of the most important problems of this war and stultify the moral grounds guiding our previous action, two views can be taken both leading to one conclusion.The first is that already expressed of a German controlled Turkey.   Is it likely that such a state would be all-ami to make peace unless to the advantage of Germany?   While the latter is ready to use Turkey for this, and while the Turks may continue to send out emissaries for such purpose, whe will find unconscious or willing dupes among pacifists and financiers with Turkish investments&apos;, such negotiations can lead to no useful result and so far as they encourage the hopp that no further military effort may be necessary, they are injurious.   Turkey onthe -
the eve of complete exhaustion in man power, desires peace but Germany has sufficient instruments of pressure over her to curb such wish within the limits she herself designates and we are able to separate Turkey from her ally only to the extent the latter desires it.The second view implies that Turkey might be willing to abandon Germany in spite of the latter&apos;s opposition and in the face of her displeasure.   Apart from the fact that with German control exercised over her Arm$, her railroads and her banks, and with German troops in Turkey, this possibility is practically out of question;   peace could presumably only be negotiated by offering Turkey advantages superios? to those she thinks would be hers by continuing as Germany1s ally.     It is a mistake to suppose that in spite of their own reverses the Turks are ir? arty way convinced of German defeat, or do not look forward to Belgium.&apos;and North Eastern-Prance ransoming Palestine, the Armenian provinces and Mesopotamia. Some may believe in their readiness to desert the Germans before the latter&apos;s defeat becomes evident,   To suppose this is to ignore the character of the present Turkish rulers. Adventurers by origin and by disposition they know that they have everything to lose from a peace which is not victorious while so long as they remain at war, Germany is obliged to support them:   they are inured to menace through long experience and only impressed by visible power - its remote possibilities exercise no influence over them,   They showed no signs of weakening when the Dardenelles expedition threatened to overwhelm them and are little likely to do so because of fear at eventual allied success in the west,   Nothing will move them which is not immediately ahead and they have not yet been farced to realize that they are attached to a losing cause,III,To refrain from declaring war against Turkey is likely to strengthen the German position at the peace negotiations by enoouraging the belief in our aims as divergent from those of our allies,   It is no answer to say that so ;Long as Turkey does not declare war on us the disadvantage if any, weighs equally on both sides,   Turkey doeB precisely what Germany directs her to do as was proved by her rupture of relations.   If she did not go beyond, it was because Germany saw no advantage in her doing so.   But if wc now abstain from such declaration we handicap our allies by the exact value of our support and allow an erroneous interpretation to be given to this,   Germany at the peace negotiations can derive no additional aid from &apos;Our declaring war on an ally, whose strength is already inJaerJiands^ But our associates at such time may f^nd themselves &quot;seriously &quot;embarrassed&quot; by this&quot; omTssfon&quot;&quot;and we&quot; will &quot;he the first to suffer through not having aided these to realize one of the most important objects in a progress which is Americans as well.Tho few Americans still in Turkey would suffer little additional hardship by our declaration of war.   Those best acquainted with Turkish psychology know that the more Turks fear the more conciliatory they become,   Our people would in any event find themselves no worse off tnan - the subjects of the Entente who have remained and who for the most part have not been badly treated. The Americans still there are mainly missionaries in.the interior where owing to their disinterested lives they enjoy as a rule, friendly relations with the looal authorities.   The fact that relief work among the survivors of the Armenian massaores might be stopped has been adduced as a reason for not declaring war.   This v/ould mean, however, if it were to be the case, subordinating a permanent gain to a precarious temporary benefit.   To allow the Turks to massacre and then solicit permission to relieve the fewsurvivors
The arguments which should make ua declare war on Turkeyare z-(l)   Unity with our Allies in one cause.(2) Unless we declare war we oan hardly aspire to an effeotive voioe in the settlement of near Baetern affairs which is necessary tt our future security,(3) The moral grounds which have contributed to our entry into the war against Germany also require such declaration against Turkey for the following reasons &apos;(a) The defeat of despotism in the ease of the Committee ofUnion and Progress who are the masters of the, *. Turkish people, &apos; .(b) The Armenian massacres and the deportation andstarvation of Arabs, Greeks and Jews,....... .(c) The principle of nationality&apos;in &quot;the caar Arr/bs,Armenians and Jews deprived of the right of self-government in territories to which they possess historic claims.4.survivors of their extermination is a policy little calculated to strike at the root of the evil.   More likely, however, certain nominal changes in relief management at Constantinople from America to neutral auspices, would suffice to obviate the necessity of ending the splendid work now being performed by our missionaries, for its continuance represents an undoubted utility to the Turks. In addition to relief distributed to the needy irrespective of their creed, it means an iMTLUX of money into a bankrupt oountry where trade has virtually ceased, as well as other benefits through the purchase of supplies, exchange, etc.   The Turks must recognise that it would not be to their advantage to stop this and providing the oentral direction be ^iven a neutral colour they arc little likely to interfere with local American distributing agencies in the interior.Although our declaration might cause American educational institutions te be occupied by the Turks who have long coveted them, if their confidence still remains unshaken, this would only be anticipating what is certain to happen in oase of their victory. If Turkey emerges from this war even half victorious, she will take* measures to obtain effective control of these which must result in forcing every American missionary out of the country, and bring to an end their work of many years devoted effort which has rendered incalculable benefits,   The new educational law passed since the war with its requirements for instruction in Turkish and its occasions for official interference offers enough indication of what is intended,v.Except at sea and In eoonomic matters our hostilities against Germany during the first year of preparation can hardly be more than on paper.   If advantage exists in declaring war against Turkey, the faot of it being ineffective should not deter u9, although military exigencies permitting, as many sound reasons can be found for -oofoperating with our allies in the East as on the Western front.   That the converse is true is proved by the presence of German troops in Turkey and the participation of Turkish divisions in Galioia and on the Roumanian front.
(4)   The blow to- German supremacy can most easily be struck in Turkey.(5)   There can be no guarantee of future peace in the world until the Turkish question ceases to form a danger to other or an excuse for improper Interference,   This can only come about by the restriction of Turkey within the purely Turkish provinces of the Empire and the sotting up elsewhere of new foundations of order established wherever possible on the principle of nationality.ItThe desirability of a declaration of war because of unity with our allies is sufficiently obvious.   Any real or supposed divergence of view from these wou&amp;d be exploited by the Central Powers to the disadvantage of the Entente,WS :- - wiAs the aims which America has set out to aocompli&amp;H involve the future destinies of Turkey, it is apparent that out position in the Peace negotiations however disinterested will carry greater weight if during the conflict we were in all respects equal to our allies instead of having held aloof from them.     How important this idea has seemed to Erance and Italy is shown by both countries being represented by small units in the British operations in Palestine.111.The reasons which have made us enter the war being more moral than material, it is difficult to understand how, having been revolted by German savagery in Belgium and at sea, we could accept even by silent acquiescence the far greater crimes committed by Tur&amp;ey,   If we condone or fail to express our disapproval of these by the most emphatic means, we violate in the following respects the canons of which President Wilson has made himself the righteous advocate before history(a) The present system of government in Turkey is one which makes it impossible to resume friendly relations,   55jo Committee ef Union and Progress who are the masters of Turkey in its internal affairs, represent an invisible and occult force, corrupt, savage and criminal, resting their power not on popular approval but on the resigned and terrified submission of a cowed population.   If we wage war against autocracy nowhere has there been a more glaring example than in Turkey of what cruelty its abuses can lead to,(b) The Armenian massacres which have involved the loss of over half a million lives stand out as the worst criiei in this war.   As a diabolical plot planned and executed in cold blood without popular or religious hatred and perpetrated solely in fulfilment of an avowed political idea, it offers in case of Turkish victory only the initial chapter in a systematic policy which will aim to rid Turkey by murder and extermination of all the non-Turkish elements.   Second only to the Armenian massacres has been the violent uprooting and deportation of tens of thousands of peaceful Arabs, Greeks and Jews expelled without reason from their homes and left to die from starvation, hardship and exposure.
(o)   Having expressed our adherence to the principle ofnationalities and imbued with the ideal of government resting on the consent of the governed, we cannot but endorse this in the case of races advanced in civilisa-tion like the Arabs, Armenians and Jews in those non-Turkish parts of the Ottoman Empire which have long suffered from Turkish misrule and to which they t^ssass^. historic claim.   In cases where it maynot. be possible to. at once set up such government the initial step -coward&quot; the goal involves the riddance of the Turk and his substitution by some single or international form of Western control undertaken in the interest and not at the expense of the population,IV,President Wilson expressing the opinion that Germany after surrendering her conquests in the west would yet issue victorious from this war if she were able to realize her Berlin-Bagdad ambition, has penetrated the importance of Turkey in the German plan.   The Ottoman Empire presents, however, the weakest link in the German chain, and is now to the &quot;Central Powers what Serbia and Roumania have been to the Entente,   To strike there is to strike at Germany where she is least able to reply as has lately been proved in Palestine and Mesopotamia,   Only oy. hemming in the Turkish Power now and hereafter can we arrest the i&amp;arch of Germany1s predatory expansion toward the East,V,Solution cannot come from compromise with Turkish usurpers and assassins * already to save themselves these are prepared to promise reforms - reforms of a kind which had made Macedonia a iand of murder till the effects of its anarohy became an immediate cause for this war.   The landmarks of 1878, 1895 and 1909 prove the utter worthlessness of such promises.   As the Turks approach exhaustion their willingness to pledge anything short of relinquishing -sovereignty will become increasingly evident.   But a government whose only faith lies in savage Pan Turanian!sm, and red-handed wrth the blood of massaore, offers no hope for subjects of another race or creed.   If we seek to lay solid foundations for future peace and render real service to humanity Palestine and Armenia cry out for assistance in their liberation with Belgium and w4th Poland,The chief reason which makes so desirable our declaration of wewr against Turkey is that without the settlement of the near Eastern question to the extent, at least, of creating in the non-Turkish parts of the Empire now states resting where possible on the basis of their own nationality and which in their normal expansion offer the promise of future order, the restoration of peace can hardly procure more than a truce,   while on the West the restitution of Belgium and even the question of Alsace-Lorraine and the. Trentino, are simple in their directness,  the constructiveV . problems-of statemanship present and future, lie rather in the&apos; East,   Mthough these must eventually be settled by the workings of natural forces, yet if we wish to escape the recurrence of the present calamity the guiding lines for the future will even now have to be traced.   In so controversial a matter and where so much remains uncertain, two postulates can be laid down,(a). Thatvthe Turkish predatory power has always, proved itself a curse to its subjects and a threat to civilization,   If.it had been destroyed in Europe as intended by the Treaty of San Stefano in 1877, the present conflict which arose out of the disposal of former Turkish Territory might never have taken place.   Unless it is now so hemmed in and restricted in Anatolia that it ceases tobe
&quot;be a menace by its disorder and unless the subject races in Turkey are not again abandoned to the irony of paper reforms, any peace will at best be a truce.   If the future of the Ottoman Empire again becomes a matter of rival European ambition and a small gang of adventurers at Constantinople are able to plunge their country into war its oontagion will spread onee more to America,(b)   That the most equitable and statesmanlike way of removing such sources of future conflict is by creating in the non-Turkish parts of the Ottoman Empire, Arab. Armenian and Zionist states under the protection of the Western Powers until such time as they are able to enter the community of free nations.The question of the Arabs, in spite of their great historical memories and clearly defined racial and linguistic  * frontiers, is, perhaps still unripe for constructive discussion. With the Armenians and Jews, however, efficient organizations exist commanding vd.de popular support, ready and able, under proper auspices, to resume the heritage of their forebears.   Both races are advanced in the arts of civilization, possessed of ancient traditions, fired by a high ideal of national consciousness. The fulfilment of their hopes presents practical possibilities of interest to all free communities and which must make for the future peace of the world.At first glance it may seem an almost impossible task to reconstitute an Armenian nation after the tragedy of which they have been the victims.   In the bo., devastated regions of Asia Minor where they lately enjoyed peaceful&apos; homes, few Armenians are now left.   It is less realized that the Moslem population has also suffered terribly from war, pestilence and famine.   The misery of the oppressed has, as always, reacted on the oppressor.   Entire regions will have to be rtpopulated.   Shall this be done by the Turks in lands where they have always been a usurping minority, thereby setting a premium on massacre misrule and disorder which will menace future peace, or under the protection of Western Nations will the Armenians rebuild their ravaged homes and govern themselves in their ancient realm?Both before and since the war several hundred thousand Armenians escaping from the Turks have taken refuge in the Caucasus and to-day when the Russian Army has ceased to fight, Armenian volunteers are defending this front.   But already the arable land available in the Caucasus, no longer sufficed for their needs and many would later have had, to emigrate, from their numbers, as well as from the survivors of the massacres and those who still remain in the Russian occupied provinces of Turkey, it is believed that over a million people can be found desirous to return to the land of their ancestors.   But it is Che&apos;father hope of the Armenians to assimilate many of the autochtonous population of Asia Minor who imperfectly Islamised, without culture or more than rudimentary traditions of their own would normally be absorbed by the dominant race.The fact that to-day, after persecution and massaore, the Armenians no longer form the majority in their own land, is no proof against the justice of their claim.   The same objection      I was raised forty years ago when Bulgaria was set up as a state and cavillers prophesied that the Bulgars would be overrun by Turks and Tartars,   But apart from the higher degree of culture existing to-day among the Armenians than the Bulgars enjoyed prior to their independence, experience proves that a Turkish population under Christian rule tends either to emigrate or else settle down, as in Bulgaria, into a peaoeful element of order.   Over those landsof
of mixed population, south of the Taurus and east of the Anatolian plateau v/here Turkish ceases to he the native tongue, the Armenians, in justice and in history, possess the first right. On the plains of Cilicia., six centuries ago, the last Armenian Kingdom flickered out its life under a French Crusading dynasty and it would he fitting gor America to aid a new democratic Armenia to &quot;begin there &apos;once more its national existence as the Poland of the Neaft Bast,A good deal of what has been stated about the Armenians applies also with equal force to the Jews,The oreation of a Jewish national home in Palestine means the vindication of an even more ancient tragedy, for the sighs of Babylonian oaptivity are still a living reality, Histori-cal, equitable and practical reasons fortify Zionist Hopes,   A cry so enduring which has been heard for over two thousand years and now louden and stronger than ever echoes from every region of the&apos; world, can only find response in the generous feelings of America, Idealists and practical men are giving their aid to the movement. Where England, Prance and Italy are to-day contributing their bbood and their treasure, to bring about the redemption of Palestine, it is unseemly for us to hold aloof or to confine our support to the mere expression of words of sympathy - a practical reason further urges this.   In the devastated regions of Poland and Russia millions of Jews have suffered acutely, and it is well nigh certain that after the war many of these will have to emigrate. But with the likelihood of far more stringent legislation everywhere governing the admission of aliens, it is only fitting that we should seek to secure for these unfortunates a refuge in the cradle of their birth as a race and a religion.   The practical means exist to restore in Zion the home of a unique people.     Those agricultural colonies which prosper even under furkish misrule, prove that the Jews reverting to their ancient soil,&quot; can again make of Palestine a land flowing with milk and honey,. It would be a noble act if an v&quot; American President could help to end the long tragedy of Jewish national dispersion begun by Pagan Emperors of Imperial Rome - a wonderful chapter opened by Vespasian, concluded by President Wilson,
