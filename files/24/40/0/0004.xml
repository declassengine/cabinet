His Britari*nic Majesty&apos;8 Government)(This Document Is the Property ofIntelligence Bureau.Department of Information, GSW/006.Colonel hm22WEEKLY  REPORT   ON   SWEDEN.   V. (Jan 80th, 1918)Like all Neutral Nations whioh assess a Merchant Fleet Sweden has been a heavy loser through the war.     Her list wf vessels ef the Mercantile Marine l$st in 191? through the action of the German It-Boats includes 39 steamers, 5 motor vessels and 17 sailing ships. The number of sailors belonging to them who were drowned was eighty. This destruction does not seem to have adversely affected the pros-perity of the country.     The net profits of the State Bank were  533,900 as compared to  325,625 in 1916.    The expansion tf trade is illustrated by the fact that in 1917 over 1200 new companies were registered with a total share capital of  22-$- millions.     In normal years from 500 to 600 companies are registered.The outstanding event in Sweden Internal politics has been the resignation of the Finanoe Minister, Mr. Branting. who is stated to be seriously ill.    His resignation was not prompted by any differences of opinion with his colleagues, whilst anothir Socialist, I-Tr. Thorsen, a prominent Labour leader, has taken his place.     Although Mr-*Brcnting&apos;8 illness is probably genuine there .are aot a few oeocle who believe that he is not altogether sorry to leave the Eden Cabinet. This feeling of relief is in no sense to be interpreted as having been caused by a wish to desert his oolleagues, but because as a non-official personage, with great influence among his country-men and with a European reputation as a pacifist, he thinks he may be able more easily to make his weight felt in the cause pt a general peace. Meanwhile he has been replaoed by a Socialist and will uneffioially do all in his power to support the present Kinistry.   Thus his resi -nation has not affected the stability of the Eden Cabinet,
Several articles in prominent Swedish Commercial newspapers laystress on the dangers to Swedish trade and independence involved &quot;byGerman supremacy in the Baltic.    To those who have known Sweden formany years there is grim humour in the undoubted fact that the Germansuccession in Russia snd the Baltic are beginning to scare publicopinion.     It is clear that all thinking men in Sweden - not to speakof Denmark and Norway - are beginning to be more and more alarmed bythB threat to Swedenrs future political and economic independence 6fGermany should succeed in establishing a monopoly of power over thesouthern and eastern Baltic coasts.     The decision in the world-waris yet to come, and all points to that decision being taken on theWestern front.     But meanwhile no shadow of doubt remains that Germanyintends, unless prevented by foroe of arms, permanently to annex theBaltic provinces.    She has not yet recognised the independence ofFinland, and the rapid peaceful penetration of her traders inScandinavia shows that something in the nature of a Hanseatic Leagueis foreshadowed.   In a resenfc weekly Report on Norway (No.2. Nov.29. &apos;17)   attention was drawn to the doings in that country of theGerman &quot;Zeutral Einkauf Gesellschaft&quot;, which like all German tradinginstitutions combines commerce with espionage.     The Scandinavian,aespecially the Swede, is essentially/slow-minded, naive creature, not unlike the average Englishman in his unsuspicious nature.    He falls an easy prey to the cunning, quick and unscrupulous, o*sfcfee German agent.    No stress need be laid on the supreme danger of &quot;peaceful penetration&quot; in countries inhabited by such beings.     Unless forcibly prevented Germany will in a quarter of a century turn Scandinavia into a mere German province.     If there is a separate peace with Russia Riga, Libau, Windau and also Reval will be under German influence, which means her monopoly of the Russian Baltic trade.     The prospects of British trade in the same quarter are even
more gloomy, as Sweden could at least trade with Russia through Abo and Haparanda.     Prior to the war, it is stated, that the Russian ex-ports to Great Britain from Riga and Revel were double those to Germanjr, so the practical disappearance of British trade in their region would be a severe blow to our prosperity.Sweden has recognised Finland as an Independent State and steps are being taken at all events temporarily to supply that starring country with food.     The recognition is oi considerable political importance, as a section of the Swedish Activists would have been glad to see Sweden intervene in Finland and perhaps even occupy part of that country.     There is a considerable Swedish population, (about 340,000) the importance of which is shown by the fact that over a hundred newspapers are published in that country in Swedish.     As the whole population is Finland is under 3   millions, roughly every eighth man is a Swede.Owing to an attack on the la.VCSwarts-^Lindman Government for neg-lecting to make arrangements with England in time for the supply of coal, towards the end ofoBecember the Swedish Foreign Office issued a communique contradicting the statement in the Press that last June Great Britain offered to Sweden 20^,000 to 250,000 tons Of coal monthly at a fixed price and that the.offer was refused.     Ho British offer was declined, and England never refused licenses to Swedish vessels to carry ooal to Sweden, provided that such vessels reached England with approved cargoes.     The shortage of coal supplies from England arose from tonnage difficulties..    following this communique H.;.l.Legation issued another to the effect that the Swedish Government were verbally imformed that coal could be had up to 200,000 tons monthly or possibly more provided Swedish vessels arrived in British ports with cargoes of steel, pig-iron etc     Later a note to that effect was presented to the Swedish Government enquiring for
V- 1 25- 4 -particulars as to the amount of coal required.     Later the Swedish Government replied that although they would like 150,000 tons monthly, not more than 100,000 could be fetched.     There seems therefore some discrepancy between the two versions as to the offerImade;   but as a definite note was presented by H.M. Minister it would appear easy to decide which version is correct.
