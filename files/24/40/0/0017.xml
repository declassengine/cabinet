CONFIDENTIAL.PIECEWORKERS AND THE 12  PER CENT.THE Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions are of opinion that there is no urgent need for abandoning the principle laid down by the Trade Union Advisory Committee, viz. : That inequalities in the case of pieceworkers created by the 12^ per cent, bonus should be removed by adjusting the less remunerative prices, and not by a general advance.A general advance to pieceworkers would initiate a new cycle of increases. If the Committee on Production were instructed to apply a formula on the following lines to the facts as ascertained on the hearing of applications from pieceworkers, it is believed that equilibrium would be restored at the cost of some trouble, but with an immense saving of money : &quot; Piecework prices and premium bonus-time allowances, which do not enable the men concerned to earn amounts reasonably in excess of those earned by timeworkers in receipt of the 12-i per cent, bonus shall be revised.&quot;Note. It is suggested that piecework prices or premium-bonus time allowances which now yield a worker of average ability 33^ per cent, or more over his time rate will rot in general require revision.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Ministry of Munitions, Group &quot; L,&quot;6, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,January 22, 1918.
PIECEWORKERS AND THE 12j Memorandum to the Minister of Munitions by the Labour Group,Ministry of MunitionsWe understand that a proposal io being put forward by the Committee on Production to the War Cabinet that the case of the piece workers, so far as the 12fcC bonus is concerned, should be net by 7^&apos; flat advance to all piece workers in the trades covered by the original Orders.     Tho Committee on Production contemplate giving an award to the Belfast workers on this basis, and to use this award to Belfast as a precedent for an extension to piece workers in the trades covered by the original Orders.2.    We are not conversant with all the facts in regard to Belfast except that we do know that tho men claim that tho whole position there is materially affected by the submarine campaign, &quot;md what may be necessary at Belfast is not for that reason applic-able elsewhere.     The Department have no information showing that the demand for payment to pieceworkers is so active in shipyards throughout the country as to make this step imperative.    In the case of the Clyde, it appears that the strike was due to a Committee on Production award in regard to list prices rather than to theSo far as engineering works generally are concerned, they are not aware of any strong case for a general extension to piece-workers.     On the contrary, so far as their own negotiations are concerned, they have up to the present been able to make arrangements with pieceworkers in the other trades with which they have dealt which would in effect result in men on unremuncreative piecework prices being benefited without affecting the higher piece earnings. It would appear therefore from the facto before us, that there is not sufficient reason for departing from the Government *s pronounce-ment which followed on the Trade Union Advisory Committee&apos;s resolution &quot;that so far as the pieceworkers in the Shipbuilding and munitions
42trades are concerned no 12-jj$&quot; shall be given, but that low pieceprices shall be revised and that employers shall be given tounderstand that this is tho decision of the Government&quot;.3.     Obvious and practical objections to the proposal ofthe Committee on Production arise, as follows:-(a) We understand it is proposed that the       shall be limited to the trades to which the original Orders applied.    The oourse of the advance to timeworkers amply prevos that it will have to go to all other trades wh* have had the 12-j^, namely in addition to the Engineering and Shipbuilding trades, the Metal trades, the Electrical trades, the Steel and Iron trades, the Chemical trades, and possibly the Building trades;(b) It is by no means clear that the Vifi would be accepted ae an equivalent by the pieco workers, and might very well lead to a wrangle for a still higher per-centage;(e) As long as a distinction between time and piece workers is maintained, the position against the extension of the bonus to women is stronger.   Immediately that distinction is swept away, the case for the exclusion of women becomes weaker.     Women, by the terms of their employment, are ontitled to increases in piece rstes as of right, and would therefore be in a stronger position to enforce a claim.     This would inevitably react on the woman time worker;(d) By conceding the 7 ?.&apos; generally to piece workers, the oldvicious circle is re-opened.     It is not protended that the 7-^* to piece workers is less than   12 /0 to timeworkers.   On the contrary, it is intended as *an equivalent.     Consequently, the position returnc to where it wbs when the 12-JfT bonus was introducod;(e) Tho effect of Braking the change in this way is.to giveto the very highly psid worker st the top of tho scale who does not need it 9t all, and to give merely 7-4  to the worker at the bottom of the scale which will not be sufficient to prevent him changing over from piece to time work;(f) Prom the fin^nci^l point of view, it will shift thepayment over from the employer to the State, for a re-sdjustment of piece prices normally falls on the employor, *md may bo compensated by increased output. This general   advance would necessarily involve increased expenditure, which would fall directly on tho Stgte;(g) It is not.clear whether the Committee on Productionpropose thst there should be merged in the 7-j^,&apos; any pie^e rite advances oince tho date of tho Order, of which there h^vc been 9 considerable number.     If it is not proposed, then the pieceworker will get *i
largo advance over the time worker.   If it is proposed, then an administrative task of the greatest possible difficulty will be imposed on some authority - a task which it is fair to say the experience of the Ministry in dealing with previous Orders indicates cannot be carried out;(h) In view of the serious unrest throughout the country and the possibility of stoppages of work following on the Government&apos;s Man-Power proposals, we think the moment inopportune to give a concession that cannot be said to be seriously demanded, snd so to part with a point which may be of great value in negotiations.Signed by:-Thomae Hunro Humbert Wolfe Stepheneon Kent6 Whitehall Gardens, 8.1.1.&quot;22.1.18
9 m.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP MUNITIONS&quot;&quot;vjv; v.: .*. -mmPROPOSED GENERAL ADVANCE TO PIECE WORKERS1,     I must warn the Cabinet of the unwisdom of this course.     It io against the advice tendered by the Trades Union Advisory Committee compooed of all the leading Trades Union-ists in the country, and it is contrary to the terns of the agreement with the Steel snd Iron Trq.de workers, and endorsed and accepted by them.   There is no general or widespread demand at the present time.     The position in every reopect is easier than it was a month ago.     There is no justification for a general advance.    Where unduly low piece rates prevail the employers should be directed to revise them.   Where special circumstances exist, as for instance at Belfast, which have prevented piece workers from realising their opportunities, special awards should be made.     But it would be absurd to pay an increase to large classes of workers who at piece rates are earning upwards of  5 per week, and in some casec up to  25 a week, and to make ouch an advance in the form of a per-ccntage on wages is to leave the grievance of the low rate piece worker practically and relatively unredressed, and to pay unasked the percentage on the very high earnings of the highest paid pioce workers.   If the advance was extended generally to piece workers the women will bo dragged in and these again will react on the time workers&apos; position and lead to the inclusion of women timoworkors in the original 12^&apos;. There are many other administrative difficulties of a most serious character, the bulk of which will have to be dealt with by the Ministry of Munitions.     It must be remembered that more than five-sixths of the whole numbers affected are under the Liini3try of Munitions.
22.     There is no excuse for shirking the laborious and practical business of insisting on the revision of low piece rates and dealing with exceptional cases on their merits.   We have succeeded in the Ministry of Munitions in spite of being hampered by Committees and other authorities, in coping to a large extent with the difficulties arising out of the application of the &apos;12j$ to the time workers.   The position is vastly better than it was before Christmas.     Work is everywhere proceeding and there are numerous instances where the men and their leaders have shown themselves fair-minded and reasonable when their case has been dealt with on its merits.   In all the bargaining and adjusting which has gone on for the last three months, wo have only given away  1,000,000, and we have not yet completely applied tho  14,000,000 for which Cabinet authority was given.     Similar patient and careful treatment of the outstanding,  difficulties in the shipyards would, we believe, after several weeks of hard work and   dealing directly with the parties concerned, lead to a reasonable and satisfactory settlement,3,     If the Committee on Production finds its task too heavy, I am prepared, on behalf of the Ministry of Munitions, to accept the responsibility of winding up the difficulty of the 124$ advance and its consequential re-actions.     The policy has been clearly defined by the Trades Union Advisory Committee and puclicly adopted by the Ministry of Labour.    If now, without any new reason, or any serious emergency having arisen in the country, the Ministry of Labour and the Committee on Production feel themselves unable to carry out the policy which they have announced, it &quot;is only fair before it is abandoned that a Depart-ment like the Ministry of Munitions which has an adequate staff and machinery for dealing with these questions, should be given
p   (1.3a fair chance to wind up the affair.      I therefore offer to under-take the burden and responsibility of settling this matter if it is placed unreservedly in my hands, within the limits of tho Trades Union Advisory Committee^ resolution.4.     If, however, this offer is not accepted in the spirit in which it is made, it will be necessary for Parliament to receive a full account of the steps which ledup to the original IZ^fo award. Mr, Barnes, in his Glasgow speech, although followed by a frank explanation in the House of Commons, has left an entirely erroneous impression on tho public mind, and if the area of tho difficulty is now to be almost indefinitely extended, it will be necessary for the full and true facts in connection with this question to be made known.     I enclose a summary of the kind of statement which I should propose to make, and which has been prepared by Major Hills, M.P., and in which the Chairman of the Employers&apos; Advisory Committee is in full agreement,Winston S. Churchill.221:1,18.
CONFIDENTIAL.12i PER CENT. BONUS.1. June 12, 1917. The Commissions on Industrial Unrest were set up and the terms of reference drawn up by Mr. Barnes. They included an instruction to report upon the inequality of wages between skilled and semi-skilled as a cause of industrial unrest.2. July 17. The Reports were published and widely read and commented on. Of the eight reports, seven referred to &quot; the skilled man&apos;s grievance.&quot;, as a cause of industrial unrest, and advised that it should be remedied.3. Therefore, by this date, without any action by the Ministry of Munitions, the existence of the grievance was established, and a wide expectation raised that it would be redressed. The Government further were committed to the abolition of the Leaving Certificates.4. August 15. Section I of the Munitions of War (Amendment) Act, 1917, giving the Minister of Munitions power to regulate the wages of time-workers was introduced in Committee of the House of Commons. The Act also gave power to abolish Leaving Certificates.5. August 16. The Minister in his speech stated that. Leaving Certificates would be withdrawn at an early date. He referred to the skilled man&apos;s griev-ance, and stated his intention of improving the rates of certain time-workers. The reason for so doing was the wish first to remedy the grievance, and secondly to prevent dislocation on the abolition of Leaving Certificates. The danger of such dislocation was repeatedly and insistently urged on the Minister by the employers^ The Minister&apos;s statement was accepted by the Government and well received by the House of Commons.   No pledge as to method, time, or degree was given.6. August 21. Major Hills&apos; Committee was set up. It consisted of repre-sentatives of the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, the Ministry of Labour, the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, the National Employers&apos; Federation, the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Steam-Enginemakers Society, and the Amalgamated Society of Toolmakers.6 (a.). August 27. Mr. Barnes, on behalf of the Government, issued a state-ment in the &quot; Times &quot; in regard to steps taken by Government Departments to give effect to the recommendations of the Commissions on Industrial Unrest. He stated that Leaving Certificates were to be withdrawn as soon as certain questions relative to safeguards had been settled. The chief of these safeguards was that adjustment of time-rates should be made to prevent the migration of skilled labour to less skilled but more highly paid employment on* piece rates. It will be noted that this state-ment was issued some time before the Hills Committee had reported, and it is not unfair to say that it prejudged the issue, for it committed the Government to adjust time-rates, and adjustment could mean nothing except increase.7. September 21. The Committee presented two Reports. The ,Majority Report was signed by the Chairman, the workmen&apos;s representatives, and the repre-sentatives of the Ministry of Munitions, and the Admiralty. The Minority Report was signed by the representatives of the employers. The representative of the Ministry of Labour, Mr. Isaac Mitchell, signed neither report, and did not present one.of his own. He stated subsequently to the War Cabinet Committee (see para-graph 18) that he dissented entirely from the Chairman&apos;s action, but he never expressed such dissent in word or writing to the Committee.8, The Majority Report recommended the following advances to all skilled men on time-work in the engineering trades: In Piece-work Shops (a.) 15 per cent, on earnings to all such men except those included in (&amp;.); (&amp;.) 121 per cent, on earnings to all men engaged on the maintenance andrepair of plant and machinery and the production of light, heat,and power.
2In Time-work Shops-Advances of 12^ per cent, and 10 per cent, respectively to the above classes.9. The Minority Report (employers), subject to the condition precedent stated in para. 10 hereof gave the following advances to skilled time-workers: (i.) In Piece-work Shops 1(a.) Id. per hour plus 10 per cent, on earnings to gauge, jig, and toolmakers, inspectors, markers off, &amp;c. (p.) 5 per cent, on earnings to men engaged on maintenance and repair, and the production of light, heat, and power, (ii.) In Time-work Shops-Id. per hour to class (a) above,(iii.)-Men engaged on time on work usually done in district upon piece  5 per cent, on earnings to all skilled men engaged on production on time.10. The Minority (Employers) Report made it a condition that the above advances, except the Id. per hour, should not apply in cases where men were given and refused a suitable opportunity of going on to piece-work. This condition was referred to the Minister, who, on the advice of. the Labour Department Committee, ruled against it. .11. Both Reports agreed (a) in giving, an advance to certain time-workers, (&amp;) in limiting that advance to the engineering trades, (c) in basing that advance on earnings, and (d) as to the amount of the advance for the &quot; tool-room &quot; class, e.g., on earnings of 60s. the Majority Report gave 15 per cent. = 9s., and the Minority Id. per hour plus 10 per cent, on total earnings ^ about 10s. On the other hand, fthey differed (a) as to the condition precedent, (b) as to the.men included, the Majority Report including a much wider class, (c) as to the amount of the advance given to all below the &quot;tool-room&quot; class, the Majority Report giving a higher rate.12. In all Major Hills&apos; Committee held ten sittings aggregating between forty and fifty hours.September 22. Mr. Barnes expressed to Major Hills his general approval of the Majority Report.13. Labour Committee, after considering the Reports, submitted two alterna-tive schemes to the Minister; one,, known first as schedule (A), but afterwards as schedule (C), was a.narrower scheme confining the advance to the &quot; tool-room,&quot; &quot; supervising,&quot; and &quot; maintenance &quot; classes. The suggested amount was 15 per cent, on earnings. The other, known as schedule (B), included practically all covered by the Majority Report, the amount being 12^ per cent. Labour Committee (except Major, Hills) supported schedule (C).14. A further difference.between the two schedules was that schedule (C) excluded, while schedule (B) included, the-moulders. The moulders were not included in either Report of the Hills&apos; Committee. The reasons for their inclusion were; (1) that they worked in close conjunction with engineers; (2) that their wages usually rose and fell with engineers; and (3) that the pattern maker had to be included in the advance, and if he was included it was difficult not to bring all the moulders in. The reasons against were: (1) that the moulders had resisted dilution; (2) that they had recently been on strike; and (3) that they were not within the class whose grievance it was specially desired to redress.It should be noted that schedule (C) contains substantially the same classes as the Employers&apos; Minority Report under the Hills Committee, the only additions being the Millwrights and men employed in public utility undertakings. The rates iof advance, however, are different, schedule (C) giving a flat 12^ per cent., and the Minority Report a graded advance from something over 15 per cent, on earnings to 2s. Qd. a week. Schedule (C) also did not contain the condition precedent asked for by the Employers.   (See paragraph 10.)15. October 8. The Minister invited the opinions of Mr. Barnes, the Ministry of Labour, and the Admiralty whether (C) or (B) should be adopted. Accordingly (after several consultations) a meeting was held at which Mr. Barnes, Sir D. Shackleton, Sir Lynden Maeassey, and others were present. Mr. Barnes and Sir D. Bhaekleton supported (C). the narrower schedule, as did also the Ministry representatives, except Major Hills who supported (B).   Sir Lynden Macassev
dissented from both. The Minister decided to bring schedule (C) before the &quot;War Cabinet.16. October 11. The Minister brought sohedule (C) before the War Cabinet. After a discussion had revealed considerable differences of opinion the whole question was referred by the War Cabinet to Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes for their decision.17. October ll.---Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes called a meeting at which the Minister, Sir G. Askwith, Sir D. Shackleton, Mr. Mitchell, Sir Alan Anderson, Sir David Harrell (Chairman of the Committee on Production), Sir Lynden Macassey, Sir Charles Ellis, Sir Thomas Munro, Mr. Wolff, Major Hills, and others were present. Lord Milner was in the chair. The Minister, at Lord Milner&apos;s request, put the case for schedule (C) at 15 per cent, and (B) at 12^ per cent., respectively. After a long discussion, Lord Milner asked for opinions as to whether (B) or (C) should be accepted. After full consideration Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes decided in favour of (B) at 121 Per cent, so as to include (a) all men getting the fitter&apos;s oir turner&apos;s rate, and (&amp;) the moulders. In this decision the Minister concurred.18. October 13. Order issued. Total estimated cost, 7 millions per annum. 19. October 15. Leaving Certificates abolished.20. Considerable difficulty arose in carrying out the Order, partly owing to the large number of border-line cases and partly owing to the difficulty of co-ordinating the actions of the various Government Departments concerned.21. Not ember. There was considerable unrest among the lesser skilled unions for the extension of the grant to their members working with the skilled men who had received the advance.22. November 10, A representative deputation of the lesser skilled unions saw the Ministry, and put the case for inclusion of their members on time rates. They were told it would be submitted to the War Cabinet.23. November 15. The claim came before Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes, who called a Conference at which the Minister, Mr. G, Roberts, Sir Albert Stanley, Sir Auckland Geddes, Sir George Askwith, Sir David Shackleton, Sir Charles Ellis, Sir Thomas Munro, Major Hills, Sir Alan Anderson, Sir Lynden Macassey, and Mr. Allan Smith, representing the Employers&apos; Advisory Committee, were present. The Conference was in favour of extending the bonusi, but that no extension beyond time-workers should be permitted. As to piece-workers, it was considered that a re-adjustment of unfavourable piece-bargains would meet the case.24. On the same day Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes met a deputation of the lesser skilled unions and conceded the advance to the semi and unskilled time-workers in the engineering foundry and boiler-making trades, and to all time-workers, skilled and unskilled, in the shipbuilding trades. Additional cost approximately 7 millions.25. November 16. The Cabinet Labour Committee was set up under the chair-manship of Mr. Barnes, with Sir Auckland Geddes as vice-chairman, and Sir George Askwith, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Wolff, Sir Lynden Macassey, and Mr. G. Calthorp as members. To this Committee were referred (1) the interpretation of the existing 121 per cent. Order, (2) the drawing up of the Order for the semi-skilled and unskilled, (3) the question.of the piece-worker, The Committee was also a general co-ordinating Committee for all labour questions.-
