They embody the considered opinion of a practical expert of highest standing, and 30 years knowledge of conditions in the   various parts of RUSSIA.Where have the crops 1914/1915/1916 gone, seeing that all exports were absolutely insignificant?In Peace time RUSSIA exported about 18$ of her harvest viz. 6/700.000.000 of Pounds (lo/ll.500.000 tone) but for calculations sake we will suppose that the exportation was not 18$ but 20$.  -In 1915 the sown surface decreased by 30$ and to this deficient sowing has to be added a failed crop.The same fact repeated itself in 1916, but on the other hand the consumption in Russia during these years increased.The Army, composed of about 15.000.000 mobilised men, consumed double the rations used before the War by the men in their homes (3 lbs. of bread per day per man).. Owing to incompetence and the lack of foresight of the Russian Army Service Corps a great quantity of cereals was lost on account of negligence in the Army depots. As a result of the withdrawal of the Russian Armies on different points of the frontiers, a very important quantity of cereals fell into the hands of the Austro-Germans.   Besides this, the population, which fled before the invaders, increased in Russia the number of mouths to be fed.
1/6 tTuring the years 1915/l9l6 RUSSIA exported to the ENTENTE COUNTRIES about 450.000 tons of Cereals.All these facts show why the stocks of 1914/l915/l9XS 7/ere nearly exhausted notwithstanding the almost non-existing exportation.     The surplus of the 1914 harvest has made it possible to eke out the available quantities in 1915/1916.We will now deal with the Russian Harvest of 1917.The sown surface was slightly superior to that of 1916, but the general harvest of 1917 was under the average.   It was bad in the whole district of VOLGA, of a good average in the districts of K0UBAN and R0ST0FF s/D0N as well as in the N.CAUCASUS.   It was of an average harvest in CRIMEA and North of Crimea.   In SIBERIA it was good.The following notes are explanatory of the colour-ings shown on the attached map:-(a) The Black line drawn from Riga southwards through Pinsk and Proskurov to the River Dniestr shows the present approximate Russian western front.(b) The Red colour in the extreme south west denotes the district of Bessarabia.   In this district the 1917 harvest was good, but it has been used entirely for the benefit of the Roumanian and Russian troops, and nothing now remains for local consumption.(c) The white colour denotes a district in which at the present time there is hardly sufficient grain left for the use of the inhabitants.(d) in the district marked Blue, the 1917 harvest was average; in some localities rather above the average. As a result of the railway communication being betterand
3.and the distances shorter from this district than any more easterly corn-growing area the bulk of the grain was exported from this locality to the whole of the front the north was also supplied to some extent from this Source.(e) Ifhe district coloured Crimson with the except tion of a small district in the north round Voronej -denotes the Cossack country.    In this locality the 1917 harvest was fair.     Turing the tenure of office of the Provisional Government large supplies of grain were exported to the north, to the Caucasus army, via the Sea of Azov to the Roumanian front, and via the Black Sea to Trebizond.   At the present time, sufficient stocks remain for local consumption, but practically none for export.(f) The district coloured Green grows maize only, no wheat.   In peace time maize was exported from this district, but at the present time there is only suffic-ient for local consumption.(g) In the district coloured Purple there is only sufficient remaining for local consumption.(h) The Brown colour denotes the Volga District. The 1917 harvest in this area practically failed, and was the worst known for many years.   It is essential to import grain into this area until the 1918 harvest is gathered.(i) The Yellow area denotes that in which there is no grain at all.     This district is not yet famine-stricken, but the further north one goes the greater is the demand and the less the supply.   Along the southern limit a certain amount is obtainable locally by purchaseacross     i
1 5?4.across the border.(j)   The wheat-growing area in Siberia is Contained in a triangle of which the towns of Omsk, Tomsk, and Semipalatinsk form the points.   It is suggested that the question of Siberian wheat for the use of the enemy may be disregarded, since the railways over which it must be transported run through those districts which most of all require this commodity,Supposing Peace was arrived at between RUSSIA and GERMANY, would it be possible for the GERMANS to receive Cereals from RUSSIA?This seems to me improbable before a year or 18 months.   I arrive at this conclusion for the following reasons:-Stocks now existing in RUSSIA will hardly be sufficient to feed the population of this country, considering the available quantities and the population and provided that an equal distribution can be made in the different districts.As regards EXPORTATION, even supposing the goods were available, the means of TRANSPORT would prevent an exportation.   There is a lack of RAILWAY CARRIAGES, ENGINES and COAL.   The state of the rail-roads would not allow of an extensive traffic.   Much time will be needed to put things right and the internal situation of RUSSIA is such that we cannot look forward to a rapid improvement.It was  till under the provisional Russian Govern-ment that the Monopoly was decreed for all Cereals, Pulse and even fur the cakes.All these articles were therefore considered State. property
5.property and no private individual&apos;had the right to&apos;buythem.The late Minister of Agriculture, Tchernoff, a Zimmerwaldist, declared at the time that all land property would be expropriated.   As a consequence of this threat the land-owners immediately delivered to the Government all their stocks, so as to receive money in exchange, because they feared firstly to be robbed by the peasants and secondly to have their property con-fiscated by the Government.We must also not lose sight of the fact that the peasants, who are at present the holders of the Cereals, (the big land-owners and the intermediary&quot;trade--having entirely disappeared) will sell their wheat only if they are compelled to do so for need of money either to pay their taxes or to buy provisions for the winter or agrioul&apos;tuT^--machinery for the cultivation of their lands.   At present the peasants, viz. the holders of the cereals, have no need of money, because doubtless they do not pay their taxes and because they cannot buy any-thing in the nature of cloths, boots, articles of food -such as sugar and tea - and iron, coal, and so on; these articles cannot be found at any price and therefore why should the peasant exchange his cereals, which for him  -represent a real value, for money which has only a con-ventlonal value and with which he can buy nothing?It is therefore highly probable and it is logical and reasonable to suppose that until the next harvest, viz., AUGUST 1918, GERMANY will not be able to get important quantities of cereals from RUSSIA.   She will perhaps get small quantities but these will be theexceptions
1546.exceptions confirming the rule.Will it not be possible for GERMANY to IMPORT CEREALS from the &quot;RUSSIAN HARVEST of 1918?To reply to this question we will have to admit first that there will be a harvest in 1918. because for the moment it is difficult to say which will be the results of the harvest which is not growing yet, and which can only gathered in JULY/AUGUST of this year, but supposing that the harvest of 1918 will even be gathered in normal conditions, I am of opinion that the exporta-tion of cereals in 1918 does not seem probable,   The lands which belonged to the nobility, to the big land-owners, and to Religious communities have been devastated and expropriated on account of the revolution, and the State, which is now the owner, has not cultivated them,The peasants, viz. the small land-holders have-^s-own less than in normal years and this because of the lack of beasts of burden, agricultural machines and, what is far worse, because of the lack of seeds.I am speaking of the WINTER sowings which are done in SEPTEMBER/oGTOBIR, because as regards the SPRING sowings, which are done in MARCH/APRIL, even if Peace were concluded now, an active intervention of the Germans would be too late to give any results.I venture to say that owing to the above mentioned circumstances, and seeing that the sown surface for the harvest of 1918 is greatly inferior to that of the preceding year, it is to be feared that there will be a scarcity of cereals for consumption in RUSSIA -I may add that some people who are not pessimisti-cally inclined talk of a coming famine.Would
7. &apos;Would it be possible to EXPORT via VLADIVOSTOCK Cereals grown in SIBERIA?Certainly, provided the Trans-Siberian Railway remains not in the hands of the Russians, but for instance in the hands of the JAPANESE or of the AMERICANS.Can we envisage an exportation via ARCHANGEL and MURMANSK?I emphatically say no.   On the one hand the railways are disorganised,   on the other hand the cereals would have to cross starving districts and they would never arrive at their loading port.
