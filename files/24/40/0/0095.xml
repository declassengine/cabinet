M. Ships and other British Sorviccs at Murmansk, and for Russian requirements,   has for some time been pooled and carried from England in Russian vessels which, after taking the coal to Murmansk, return to England,   mainly with Iron arc as ballast,    for a further cargo of coal*Latterly the Russian authorities at Murmansk have been raising difficulties and refusing to allow Russian ships to sail for British ports to bring back coal until the British Roar-Admiral had given a written guarantee that the shpLps would be given a safe conduct back to Murmansk.     Such a guarantee has been given in respect of a specific voyago of specific ships *It now appears that the Russian authorities are refusing to allow the ships to sail unless the guarantee includes a safe conduct of the ships back to Murmansk even, in the event cf war breaking.out between England and Russia?     The Roar-Admiral states that the Russians appear to be suspicious that yjc have ulterior motives in getting their ships back to tho United Kingdom and desires instructions as to giving the guarantee now asked for.The following points appear to merit consideration:-
that wo should have coal, and if Russian ships sre not available, the coal to meet British requirements will have to be sent in British ships, for which purpose British tonnage can ill be spared.(2) The Russian vessels are not of great value andtheir loss would not be serious to us, even in the event of War between England and Russia^(5) The oro which has hitherto been brought back bythese vessels as ballast would presumably not be available if we ceased to supply coal to meet Russian requirements,   tut In any case this ore is not of prime importance, as our requirements in this respect are mot for some months ahead*It Is proposed to inform the Rear-Admiral at Murmansk that he may give a separate guarantee in the case of each Russian ship for each separate voyage that the vessel in question will be given a safe conduct, back to Murmansk, but that, if possible, the guarantee should not specifically refer to a safe conduct In the event of the outbreak of war.     Further that in order to induce the Russian authorities to accept a guarantee in general terms,   he may threaten the cutting off of coal supplies for Russia, but that if the Russian authorities persist in refusing to allow their ships to sail vfithout a guarantee of safe conduct which rofors specifically to the event of war,   then such a guarantee may, in the last resort, be given to secure the temporary use of these ships.The matter is referred, to the War Cabinet for their approval of the course proposed.(Signed). ERIC GEDDES.January, 1918*
