(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)Intelligence Bureau.department of Information.5*^  231secret.25. 1. 18.II E H 0 B A IT D U UonTHE SITUATION   II?   BEISIUM.a report emanating from a reliable source describes the spirit of the Belgian people in the occupied provinces as admirable.   There is stated to be no signs of wetness and no desire for peaoe except on satisfactory terms.    This is all the more remarkable on account of the tyrannical Government whteh the people of Belgium have had to endure since August 1914.    The proceedings of the German Government . Have, already been briefly described in a Memorandum recently issued by this Detsjrfcaeat.It is satisfactory to learn that the events in Russia have produced no disturbing effect and that the belief is entertained in Belgium that the principles of the Bolsheviks will permeate into Germany with results disastrous to the existing militarist regime.   The feelings of loyalty to King Albert appear to be unanimous and there is said to bo no workman&apos;s dwelling where a portrait of His Majesty is not to be found.    Physically there is much suffering.    Tuberculosis caused by privations is common.    The successor to von Biasing. General von .&amp;lkenh*uaen is represented by a oompetent observer to be without toy of the strong qualities which the former displayed,and as being an oH soldier of limited intelligence knowing little or nothing beyond Military questions.    His compl^te-signoranae of administrative business is augmented by the faot that he is weakened by age and over indulgence in the pleasures of the table.    Busy with more agreable occupations, he leaves all the work to his subordinates who fight with*aoh other for his favour.    He listens to everyone, understands no-6ody and oonours in every suggestion put forward in order to save
- 2 -himself trouble.    The oivil administration of the country of whioh von Biasing, with Borne ^stice claimed to be the central figure, has become anarchical.     The result of this state of affairs is naturally unpleasant for the Belgians who are the sufferers in the rivalry of the Governor-General&apos; s subordinates for the favour of their chief. There is no sign that the cruelty of the Germans has diminished, and quite lately there was a further mass-execution of Belgians one of the victims being a child of 14 - a girl.     It is fair to say that some of the Gorman officials who were employed in Belgijaa during the earlier months of the occupation have retired, disgusted at the ar-bltary arrests and deportations and by no means flattered at having to wofck with Belgians who, like some of the activists of the Flemish movement, are traitors to their country.     This fact, whioh is re-ported from a reliable souroe, is worth recording.     One of the worst officials in Belgium is a certain Count Harraofc .     This man, an &quot;embusoue&quot; and before the war an incompetent amateur sculptor, ob-tained the office of Censor in Belgium.     He has been a malign in-ftuencs on the incapable old Governor-General.   He has not limited his activities to watching that German interests are not injured by the Press but has sought to make of the latter a tool for his own projects.     Under his influenoe the German Authorities have created an animosity against and distrust for the Flemish language which, after the war, may compromise the advantages which the Flemings had secured for themselves before 1914.   , This press campaign has resulted to a flood of calumnies being published against anything or anybody that has   preserved a feeling of patriotism or a regard for national honour.     The result has been a series of law-suits which have put Count Harrach An a very difficult position as the articles, against toich exception has been taken had passed the Censorship.     Count tf&amp;rraoh to save himself has had recourse to one of the most monstrous snactments which even a German has ever imagined.     He persuaded the
Governor-General to sign a decree (dated No. 15.&apos;iy) whereby a press notice whioh has passed the Censor - that is Count Harrach - cannot form the subject of a civil or criminal suit at law without the au-thorisation of the Chief of the Civil administration.     The impunity of any campaign of calumny is henceforth guaranteed.With regard to the co-called flemish movement the following infor-nietion direct from M. Huysmans, one of the founders of it, is of interest.Before the war all the movement demanded was cultural independence and an administrative separation approximately equivalent to that existing between England and Scotland.     The party did not want a separate legislature or even separate Ministries.    As regards such branches of Government as Education and the Fine Arts they desired separate Flemish divisions in the Government offices but presided over by a common Minister,     They also asked that the officers of Flemish Regiments should be able to speak Flemish though they did not object to the word of command being given in French.    Nor did they object to French being a compulsory subject in Flemish schools so long as Flemish was the main language.     In short the movement was an internal one one- with no more separatist tendency than say &quot;Home Rule for Wales&quot; These were and are some extremists;   but they were never sufficiently numerous nor active to be represented in Parliament.When the Germans oocupied Belgium, with the genius for mischief ^ich is their leading characteristic , they endeavoured to exploit the ?lemish movement.    As is their wont the Flemings were represented as unredeemed German brethren languishing under the French yoke and ex-Posed to the grossly immoral influences of that degenerate people.   The Flemish provinces were really a portion of Germany which had fallen on evil days.     In fact, to use the words of Arnofs famous poem &quot;Das Vaterland muss grflssen sein&quot; and the Flemings must be gathered into toe fold.
Their efforts do not appear to have been attended with muoh success, but they have collected a little party of activists whose programme is as follows\-(1)   Those who desire the Walloon provinces to be annexed to France and the Flemish provinces to Germany or Holland.(8)   Those who wish to create two completely separate and independent States.It)   Those who wish to create two cantons on the Swiss model, within the 1 cadre&apos; of a single Belgian State.     It is said, that the supporters of (1$ and (2) r.re extremely few in number.AmThe two principal supporters of the movement are M. Joas and      ... prmio. the latter probably a German agent.     These persons some time ago submitted a statement of their aims to the Dutch Scandinavian Committee.   A highly competent Professor of Philology declares that t * there are undoubted signs that this statement, whioh is in Flemish.  . was translated from a German draft.There is information that there is a certain pro-Flemish ferment in the Belgian army at the front where the Flemings are in the majority and there have occasionally been slight racial disturbances behind the lines - but it seems that too much weight should not be attributed to such, untoward events.The aotivist movement in Belgium itself is. according to a most competent authority, not of great importance.     Its only strength is derived from the faot that it possesses at present the exclusive right of propagating its view3 by speech and in print.     But the &quot;Intel-leotuals&quot;, who originally were its chief supporters, are thoroughly opposed to it as a separatist movement while the masses are thoroughly indifferent.    The bulk of the Belgian inhabitants believe that Germany will sooner or later be compelled to withdraw from the country and this does fcot tend to strengthen the activist cause.
