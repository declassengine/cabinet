The following observations are based on some experience gained while conducting propaganda work in Denmark, and from conversations with people of all sorts during my short visit to England in December 1917.2.     A year1 s residence in a neutral country gives one a more ob-jeotlve view of the war than was passible in France or England.    Seen from this standpoint one get$ the impression that the Allies are waging the war with more force than cunning;   or, in other wordB, that ab-sorption in the business of fighting has blinded them to its psycho-logical issues.    While Germany, starting with a had cause, has lost no opportunity of improving her caBe in the eyes of neutrals and of her people, and has now succeeded so far as to unite most of her par-ties in the belief that she is fighting msnely for peace and in self defence, the Allies have allowed themselves to be manoeuvred into a position in whioh they have forfeited the good will of the new Buaaian democracy and are, I fear, losing sympathies abroad, (perhaps also at home) which were theirs at the outset of the struggle.
2,       This result is partly due to causes for which we are hot res-ponsible;   but, in its broader aspect, our failure to maintain themoral advantage with which we began the war appears to be due to threefundamental, but widely held fallacies, viz;-(1). That Germany is still the victor from a &quot;War Map&quot; point of view; and that it is indispensable for our success that we should drive her out of the occupied territories.(2). That autocratic &quot;Militarism&quot; can only be destroyed by the overthrow of the German armies on the battlefield.(3). That political offensive (known to the public as &quot;Propa-ganda&quot;) is of little value;   that everybody knows what we are fighting for;   and that, therefore, a re-statement of our war-aims is unnecessary.I.   TEE &quot;WAR MAP&quot; FAZIAOY4.       The first of these propositions appears to be very generally believed both by soldiers and civilians;   and one even hears it said that if we cannot drive the Germans out of Belgium we must admit do-feat and humiliation.     I suggest that this view rests on a misconcep-tion of the nature of modern War, more especially of this war.5.       In modern War the decisive weapon is not physical force but economic pressure.    This fact is often lost sight of by the civilian reader of history because the defeated State has usually sued for peace when its Armies have been beaten, without waiting for the economic pressure which would inevitably have followed if submission had been delayed.    The pressure in question is applied by the victor seizing the enemy1s communications and resources, thereby paralyzing the life of the country.    Now, in old days, when countries were self-contained and self-supporting, the only way of gaining such a control of the $enemy1 s resouroes was by invading his territory.    later, as the nations became more and more dependent on over-sea imports, the maritime block-ade became an important, though still an auxiliary, means of striking at the enemy1 s resources.    Finally the course of the present war has
developed a new method, that of acquiring the resources at theirsource by the enlistment of one resource-producing nation afteranother in a Coalition.    The Allies can continue to exist by tradingwith each other;   Germany cannot continue to exist cut off from(a)commercial intercourse with the world.      We have, in fact, gone on from the Maritime Blockade to the Armed Boycott   of the enemy State, a method of economic pressure more simple and more complete than any of its predecessors,6.       When, in old days, a atate was invaded and was being driven by economic pressure to submission, it could only obtain relief by a military viotory over the invaders.    Similarly, under the existing system of Combined Blockade and Armed Boycott,the only way by which the Central Powers can regain access to the resources which we hold out of their reach is by a decisive military victory.    It is there-fere for Germany, not for the Allies, that a military viotory is in** dispensable,7.       It should be insisted on that, even if it came to a bargaining deal on the basis of the wY/ar Map&quot; (as the Germans have often suggested) the Allies hold by far the best cards, a point of whioh the British public seem to be generally unaware.    Quite apart from the German colonies, our possession of the enemy1s oversea trade-routes, and of the world&apos;s chief sources of raw material are far more valuable assets than all the European territory whioh the Central Powers now occupy.It was formerly said of the English that they never knew when they were beaten;   it looks almost as if the same happy lack of imagi-nation prevents us from realising when we have won.la) I admit that this argument rests on two assumptions;- (1) that the submarine war cannot reduce us to submission within a finite time limit, and (2) that the Germans cannot within a reasonable time exploitRuEsia!s resources to such an extent as to become independent of inter-?course with the rest of the world;   but as far as I am aware both theseassumptions are Justified,/ (
1 - 4 -8,        It d.oed not, of course, follow from this argument that our armies should restrict themselves to the taotioal or even to the strategical defensive.    That is a military cuestion which must be left to the judgment of the higher staffs.    The Germans&apos; claim that they are waging a defensive war does not prevent them from undertaking offensives on the largest scale.     But It must be made clear to our publio that our ultimate military aim, is a defensive, not an offensive, one.    This is no mere question of dialectics, Phrases such as &quot;our aim is victory&quot; or that &quot;Germany1 s military power must be broken on the battlefield&quot;are morally dangerous as they convey to the civilian mind the idea of a successful offensive followed by a &quot;Break through&quot; on a grand scale,    How the British publio have learned a good deal about trenoh warfare during the last two years, and are beginning to feel sceptical about the possibility of a break through.    Yet they are allowed to believe that anything less than this is defeat.    Our people are too practical to commit themselves to a polioy of despair;   and yet too proud to accept failure.    The result is visible in a certain amount of uneasiness and depression in the British Press, whioh only brings grist to the mills of the &quot;defeatist&quot; agitators,9. The Germans, in spite of their advantageous position on in-terior lines with secure land communications, have jhong sinoe oeased, in official utterances to speak of the occupation of Paris, or the driving of the English out of Prance as Indispensable for their success Yet for them these things are really indispensable if the Allies still refuse peace; and they have made several determined efforts to achieve them.    Are we not, then, incurring unnecessary risks to-our unity and national moral by continually setting before our people an aim whioh is not indispensable, and. which may even be physioali^unattain-. able.
II. The Physical Force Fallacy10,    The second fallacy:- that militarism can only be destroyed by the overthrow of its exponents on the battlefield, appears to be neith^-logioal nor in accordance with the lessons of history.    Militarism -in the sense that we mean - is a belief in physical force as the ul-tima ratio.   To argue that this belief can be destroyed by arraying greater physical forces against it is illogical.     Under such conditions the belief in physical force would bo not destroyed but vindicated, and the obvious conclusion to be drawn from an Allied victory would be, not that physioal force was a false god, but that the Germans had not enough of it on their side.    The belief in militarism was not des-troyed by Waterloo or Sedan,    True, the French were forced to ebandon it, but their victors became its most convinced disciples.     \hat shall to gain by destroying militarism in Germany if it is only to reappecr in one or other of -ermany^ victors?   It seems to me that it is the failure of the governing classes in all countries to admit this point of view which is inspiring the labouring classes on both sides to seek an agreement independently of their Governments,Though a belief in force oannot be destroyed by force, yet it can be discredited by failure:   indeed this has partly taken place already, 5he recent victories of the Central Powers aroused little enthusiasm in Germany and evon censed depression in &apos;ustria.    If Germany, with only victories to her credit, has finally to accept terms of defeat(a)owing to her inability to break the Armed Boycott of the Coalition, ( then militarism will indeed be revealed as an exploded doctrine, and the belief in physioal force will die a natural death.[a) it is true that physioal force plays its part in this process, but it is a negative and secondary role, that of frustrating the at-tempts of the Central Powers to break up the Coalition.
/ i- 6 -11.    llor does there seem any reason to fear that this change will merely result (as is sometimes suggested) in the substitution of economic oppression for oppression by force, with no more security for the weak against the strong than hitherto under the reign of militarism.    3:teonomio pressure can scarcely produce the swift and decisive results, and the silencing of critioism by terror, on which militarism relied in the past;   and in a long struggle the moral judgment of the world will have time to assert itself, and may be trusted to range itself with effective means against the oppressor.Ill      The Moral Fallaoy.12.    The third fallacy:- that everybody knows what we are fightingfor, that there is no object in re-stating our war aims, and that apolitical offensive generally is of doubtful value, - is partlytypical of the individualist British tendency to ignore criticism,but it really based on a failure to appreciate the value of moralforces in war.    One sees this in the very subordinate role that isaccorded to publicity in our war-machinery;   in the looseness ofcontact between the l&quot;.ress and the Higher Naval and Military Staffs;and in our ignorance or disregard of opportunities which have been(a)offered to us by the enemy1s psychology.Moral forces are the motive power and are therefore primary, not secondary.    The defection of Russia and the disaster on the Isonao were due far more to skilful political offensive and oonse-quent propaganda than to superiority of material force.13.    Uor can we rely on the excellence of our cause and its general recognition at the outset of the war.    As a war progresses, moralIaLt. 1 refer Particularly t0 ihe small encouragement which we gavo to the German liberals in their campaign for the nJffo Annexations&quot; resolution of July 1917.
values axe constantly ohanging.    Heutrals grow callous to atrocities and breaches of international law;   as war-weariness grows, theIaccusation of needlessly prolonging the war excites more moral indig-nation than that of baring commenced it needlessly or having waged it barbarously.    Actions which have been forced on us by the action of the enemy may cause some of our original watoh-words to sound dan-gerously like platitudes, if the differenoe of circumstances is not carefully explained.     &amp;bove all, the enemy has changed (or appeared to change) his ground;   the pan-German dream of world dominion has lost favour, and there is a growing realisation that Germany is faced by eoonomio problems whioh cannot be solved by military power.    In all oountries the talk about a League of Nations (or *orld State) has brought a new Era within sight, to whioh even the most liberal British ideals of Empire need to be adjusted.    Meanwhile we ere ex-posed to the persistent and malicious representations of propagandists, skilled in every art of psychological suggestion and re-iteration0 In these circumstances it would be as unwise to rest content v/ith the original statement of our case as for an army to remain im-mobilo in its position while the enemy manoeuvred round its flank. On the contrary, the presentation of our case needs to be as continuous ly and progressively revised to meet changed circumstances;   as the programme of a profrressive politioal party in peaoe time.,   *.?e can only do this if we keep a hand on the pulse of our own people as &quot;/ell as on that of the enemy.14.    In all states at war there is:-(1)   An Imperialist or Chauvinist right wing, whose aim is conquest and aggrandisement,)(2)   A &quot;defeatist&quot; left wing, who wish only to stop fighting; and(3)  A large Middle Party, peace-loving but patriotic, who will remain staunch so long as they are convinced that their country^ aims are Just, moderate, and attainable, but who break up into nervous groups with a tendency to ^defeatism&quot;m.  7   -
when they feel any doubts on either of these points, so that their belief in the justice of a cause will depend somewhat on its success;  when success is deferred it is all the more important to allow no doubts about the jus-tloe and moderation of the objects aimed at.15.    Of the three above named groups tho Chauvinists can do us nothing but harm, and must be induced to keep silence;   this should not be difficult as they are more open to the argument of patriotism than the other groups.    The &quot;defeatist&quot; eaement is not very danger?-ous bo long as its numbers are small, and may even be used - like the Socialists in Germany - to appeal to &quot;defeatist&quot; elements In the opposite camp.    It becomes dangerousj however, when it begins to draw recruits from the Middle Group and it points to some failure in our propaganda-strategy when this begins to happen.That we have not succeeded better in these respects implies no criticism on our organs of publicity.    The &quot;grand strategy&quot; of Political Offensive is in the hands of the highest offioials of the State, who alone or.n Bpeek with authority and whose utterances ore the only oneB whioh find their way, without Serious distortion, to the masses on both sides916.    The working of these principles has been well illustrated in Germany during the lest two years.At the beginning of the war the oause of the Oentral Powers was as bad as it could well be.    fhe German Government knew this, but they v/ere prepared to disregard the world1b judgment, believing that &quot;hurrah patriotism&quot; was a sufficient motive force, and that success would bring its own justification.    The discussion of war aims was accordingly forbidden and little strategical information waB given to the Press,17.    After a while, as the war showed no sign of ending, theGovernment realised that enthusiasm was on the wane end that the
\ */ ; i- 9 -internal union of Germany could only be maintained by confidence in ultimate vioiory and war indemnities.    So the General Staff began to take journalists more frankly into their oonfidence, enabling them to make expert comments on the operations, and to concentrate public attention on the theatres of war where German victories were being gained.    So, with constantly renewed promises of an early peaoe, the burden cf war continued to be patiently borne *18.    This procedure worked successfully, but with diminishing re-sults, for a couple of years, but in the summer of 1917 a olimax came, owing to the extreme shortage of food, the intervention of   -America, and the failure of the extravagant hopes placed in the Sub-marine War.    Germany was disunited and seething with discontent.   The official explanation of the origin of the war was being openly ques-tioned.     In spite of the efforts of the bureaucracy the Reichstag majority had brought forward its &quot;No Annexations&quot; Resolution which marked a considerable advance from the standpoint of the previous yoar.    It seemed as if the Allies were not far from realising their aim:- the dethronement of the Prussian military autocracy by the rising forces of liberalism.19,    The military party (i. e. Ludendorff, Eindenburg, and the Crown Prince) appear to have boldly recognised the need for re-uniting the nation behind thorn if viotory was to be gained.    This oould only be tone by convinoing the German masses that the war was a purely defen-jsive one, and by making such oonoessions to Parliamentarism as to per-suade them that their Government really represented the people. The result was the passing of Erzberger^ Hesolution (with reserva-tions), and subsequent further concessions to Parliamentarism at the time of von Eertllngas appointment.80.    Unfortunately - as it appears - the Allies aided Ludendorff*s
policy by gree^ting-the-teLy Eesolution and the German reply to the Pope&apos;8 Hots with a chorus of threats and derision,,without, as far as I am aware, offering a word of encouragement to the Liberal forces which had then attained a first partial success against Militarism. As a result, Ton Kt&amp;lmann was able tc convince the Heichstag that nothing less than the destruction of Germany would satisfy the En-tent e , and the German people stood once more united behind the Govern-ment, convinced that thoy were fighting for their existence.    The revelations at the Sukhomlinoff trial had been skilfully used to solve the Question of responsibility for the war in a manner satis-factory to Germany;   and the German people were for the first time oonvinoed of the innocence of their Government. %Meanwhile, outfeide Germany, the propagandists of tho Central Powers had been actively sowing the seeds of defeat and disunion in Russia, Italy, and Prance, with the results that are visible to-day,21.    If wo contrast the procedure of the enemy with our own in those matters, it must be admitted that the Germans have been wiser in their generation than the Allies.    The contrast is all the more striking because the German task was harder than our own.    They had to rely on falsehood and misrepresentation where we could rely on truthc They had to create impressions whero wo roouired only to publish facts.    The most striking example of this is in the revelations already referred to, at the Sukhomlinoff trial.    The moral impor-tance of these revelations, or rather the construction placed on them by the German propaganda - can scarcely bo exaggerated, since they relieved the German conscience of all sonso of responsibility for the war.    It should not have boon difficult to prove, by an analysis of dates and events, that the German Government had already made war inevitable before the alleged deceptions by the Russian Generalr
(a)    Note by Department of Information.This was, as a natter of fact, done by the Department of la-formation, but such work lacked -nhe mrfchority which would have belonged te an official pronouncement by the Allied Governments *,Staff took ^place, In fact that the whole incident is placed, too (a)late.22,    For the rest, our mistake appears to lie in not exploiting the craving for peace;   whioh possesses a large. portion (perhaps the majority) of our enemies, by feeding them with hopes of ad-vantageoua conditions if only they can free themselves from their militarist masters.    Every statement of our war-aims, however vigorous its phraseology is required to be, should contain this suggestion of an alternative, that is of milder conditions which might be obtained by a non-militarist Germany.    President Wilson*s statements seem in this respect more skilfully conceived than our own, which have seemed sometimes more calculated to unite our enemies than to cause divisions among them.23,    lastly, we must have the courage of our ideals.     It is in-evitable that neutrals should feel some scepticism when we stand up as champions of democracy under leaders, some of whom have not, in the past, shown much enthusiasm for demooracy, and are supported hy newspapers whioh have been its determined opponents.     Indeed the northern neutrals have gone so far beyond us in the path of democracy that some of our institutions appear to them hardly less feudal than those of Germany,    The attitude of a part of our Press towards the Russian Revolution has been watched in Scandinavia with surprise and curiosity.    Our ability to regain the sympathy of Ireland and of the new Eastern democracies will be regarded by many as the touchstone of our sincerity.
1 1S* &apos;24.    It seems now , for the moment, that the militarists hare tho^upper hand in Germany, and high hopes are being built on a decisivenvictory in the r/est.    But an opportunity, similar to that of July 1917, for our political offensive is bound to recur when the pro-mised German military offensive fails once more to bring a decision; or perhaps sooner if a breakdown in the negotiations on the Eastern Front postpones the reopening Of tirade with Russia.     It is to be hoped in that case that we shall have an encouraging word to offer to the German Ireisinnige and Socialists, and that we shall let them feel that, if they fear exclusion from the friendship and markets of the world, the choice lies in their own hands.
