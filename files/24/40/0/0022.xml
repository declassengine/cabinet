cument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]At  :      Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1918r QV/7SECRET.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a letter from Lord Milner and my reply, together with the telegram from Sir C. Greene referred to by Lord Milner.A. J. B.January 21, 1918.(1-)Lord Milner to Mr. Balfour.(Confidential.)My dear Balfour, 17, Great College Street, S.W., January 20, 1918.SIR C. GREENE&apos;S telegram from Tokyo&apos;of the 17th January, No. 45, which I have just read, induces me to write to you.We ,had some talk at the Cabinet in your absence about our attitude to Japan over Vladivostock and the development of the Siberian situation generally.  / don&apos;t at all know what your views are.  I think the majority of the Cabinet were rather * inclined to look with suspicion on Japan, and to think that isolated action on her part should be discouraged.  But no decided conclusions emerged.Personally I am very strong of Greene&apos;s opinion. I know there is a very strong prejudice against Japan among the Entente Powers, a feeling that she is playing entirely for her own hand, &amp;c. I think myself that a good case could be made on the other side on general grounds, and that if Japan has not done much for the Alliance she has, on the other hand, not been very tactfully handled by it.But this is rather too wide a controversy for me to enter into.   I must try to keep to the specific point: what we ought to do about her possible intervention in &apos; Siberia.My own view is that the defence of the interests of the Alliance in that region of the globe is Japan&apos;s natural job. We have over and over again been disposed to complain of Japan for not helping more. When we came to examine in detail how and where she could help, we have always got ourselves bogged in. &quot; doubts and dismays.&quot; The only propositions we have put up to her have been of the most unattractive character from her point of view.; Now here is a case where she might be of the greatest use, where she is, in a far better position to act than any of the! rest of us, and where she quite evidently would like to act, if -action becomes necessary. Why should we not let her? Taking the war as a whole, it-is evident that we want all the help we can get. We have often regretted getting so little from Japan. Now here is a case where we certainly can get it, if we will. Why should we not encourage her at least to the extent of suggesting that, if Allied intervention is necessary, it is Japan who should take action on behalf of the Allies?^At the worst this is making a virtue of a necessity. If Bolshevism becomes too rampant in that quarter, Japan certainly will intervene, whether the other Allies like it or not. She alone can intervene with any considerable force. There seems to me no evidence that she desires to rush in prematurely or unnecessarily. What is quite evident, is that she desires, if action on a large scale has to be taken, that she should be the Power to take it. And certainly she&quot;has a priori the best right, both because she is most directly affected and far and away in the best position to take prompt and effective action. The objection to her doing so is twofold: (1) that Russia might resent it; (2) that Japan would seize the opportunity to take undue advantage of her Allies.As regards (1), is there any evidence that Japanese intervention would be more-resented than any ot,her foreign intervention? No doubt it would be resented by the Bolsheviks and the Germans.   But it would presumably be welcomed by the local autonomists, who here as elsewhere are trying to resist Bolshevik tyranny &quot;and whom [187]     , &apos;        &apos;
it is in our interest to. help. And (2) as for Japan wishing, to take undue advantage of the Allies, will she not be more rather than less likely to do that if we show distrust of her in the matter? i To my mind it is clear that, if there must be intervention, it will, from the * nature of the case, be mainly if not wholly Japanese. The only question is, whether it is to take the form of Japan intervening in the name of and on behalf of the Allies, and with their goodwill, or of Japan finally intervening &apos;&apos; on her own &apos;&apos; after a Greater or less degree of friction, due to the insistence of other Allies upon having a finger in the pie.My own view is that we should let the Japanese know now, that if interven-tion becomes necessary in the interest of the Allies, we regard Japan as the natural4 party to undertake it, on behalf of us all. I should rather welcome the opportunity of showing that amount of confidence in her. I believe it would pay us, and I think too there is a certain advantage in getting Japan more deeply committed than she actually is in the world-struggle against Germany and German influences. There is always a certain danger, as it seems to me, as long as she remains only half in, of her gradually slipping out and even ultimately of her being &apos;( got at&apos;&apos; by the Germans. They would not be slow to take advantage of any &quot; rift in the lute&quot; of our friendship with her. Moreover, I have a great dislike of mixed expeditions. The Palestine business is a case in point. The insistence of the French and Italians on being &quot; represented &quot; there is of no real use to them and a nuisance to us. It is only of comparative unimportance, because we are so much less touchy than any other people on earth about these fiddling self-assertions and interferences. But it does not make even us feel more friendlv to the; French and the Italians to realise that thev think it necessary to show themselves in1 Palestine, for fear of our making, a selfish, use of our preponderant strength in that country. And if we wanted to play them false over it their insignificant contribution would not prevent us.   If&apos; there is to be an Allied expedition into Eastern Siberia, it will in fact beviust as much a Japanese expedition as the Allied invasion of Palestine is a British invasion. And if we or the Americans make a point of being represented &quot; there, it will be quite as useless and probably the cause of much more trouble than the French and Italian flag-wagging in Palestine, which is only harmless, because we, being. British, have a happy indifference to such things. Forgive this long and rambling letter, which needs no reply.Yours ever.MILNER.(2.)Mr. Balfour and&apos;. Lord Milner.(Private.)My dear Milner, Foreign Office, January 19, 1918.There is much in.your letter (received on the 1.9th, though dated the 20th) with which I am in hearty sympathy, hut-there are some points which deserve comment.(1.). The Japanese-attitude, towards the Allies.I concur with you in thinking that, exaggerated statements have often been made about, the insufficiency of Japan&apos;s assistance. But though her collaboration has certainly been important, I cannot quite agree with you in thinking that it has been all that we had a right to expect. She has not been very nice over merchant tonnage, and her refusal to sell, us old battle-cruisers or to send new battle-cruisers to co-operate with our fleet is, in my opinion, quite unjustifiable. She is the only belligerent, country amongthe Great Powers which, whatever happens, seems likely to come out of the war possessing both more money and more territory than when she entered into the war..So far as Lhave experienced her diplomatic methods, I have nothing&apos;of which to complain, except, perhaps-, the absurd attempt to make a grievance out&apos; of&quot; an incident which happened while Lord R. Cecil was in charge, aiid which the Japanese totally; misrepresented; But L think you must-have seen a recent very confidential telegram from Sir C. Greene narrating&apos;a very private, conversation which took place between the American Ambassador in Tokyo and an important member of the Japanese Government: I: believe that this conversation took&apos; place without&quot; the knowledge of the Foreign Minister, and I have no reason to think that it represents his views; but it gives one furiously to think.
(2.) Japanese action in Russia.I agree with you in thinking that, if Allied action is required in Siberia, the Japanese are the proper people to be entrusted with the task. But the difficulties seem somewhat greater than you suppose.I can hardly believe that you are right, for instance, in thinking that the landing of a great Japanese force in Siberia will be no more resented by the Russians than the landing of a great American or British force, supposing that such an operation were possible. It is obvious that neither the United States of America nor Great Britain can1 have any territorial ambitions in that part of the world, while to many good observers it seems quite obvious that Japan has. If, to these considerations with regard to the future, you add the memories of the past-the Russo-Japanese war-it seems to me clear that thinking and patriotic Russians are much more likely to fear the results of an invasion by the Japanese than of an invasion of any other people except the Germans.As to the clearly expressed objection of the Japanese to what you call &quot; flag-wagging &quot; by a small American or British force in Siberia, after the manner of the French and Italians in Palestine; if it has any significance at all, which perhaps it has not, it might easily excite, in the minds of the suspicious, the suspicion that if Japan once occupied Eastern Siberia, in Eastern Siberia she would stay.In your letter you seem to assume that the main obstacle to giving Japan a free hand is British suspicion; but I think that you will find that the United States of America are much more suspicious than we are. When I was in America I found that the State Department took a profoundly gloomy view of Japanese policy. I did what I could to combat suspicions which seemed to me, on the evidence, some-what excessive, and the subsequent Japanese Mission may have done more. Never-theless, I think you will find that Washington (which must clearly be consulted before Japan is invited by the Allies to take solitary action) would be very hostile to the scheme; though, in the face of some new and overmastering necessity, this attitude might possibly be modified.I am circulating to-day a Memorandum prepared in this Office, and represent-ing the considered opinion of those War Office and Foreign Office officials who take part from day to day in the labours of the Russian Committee. Their suggestion is startling; they not only desire that Japan should land a large force in Siberia,&apos; but they desire her to occupy the whole length of the Siberian Railway from Vladivostock to the borders of European Russia. Their great fear is, not that Japan will go too far, but that, having comfortably settled down in Eastern Siberia, she will not go far enough. The&apos; object of their scheme is to enable us not merely to protect our stores, &amp;c, in Vladivostock, but to get into touch with -the Cossacks, and to furnish supplies to Southern Russia.If the military authorities are right in thinking that their scheme is a practic-able one, it is very well worth the consideration of the Cabinet, and it fits in sufficiently well with the general line on which your thoughts are travelling. I own I am doubtful. How can the Japanese or anyone else protect 3,000 miles of rail-way in a foreign and perhaps hostile country?(3.)     &apos; JAPAN.Sir C. Greene to Mr. Balfour. (Received January 18.)(No. 45.) Tokyo, January 17, 1918.As Parliament is due to meet in a week, and Cabinet may have to explain their foreign policy, I venture to sum up situation in regard to possible intervention in Siberia, as far as I can judge it from the end.There appear to be two courses open to Allies, either to press a claim on Japanese for participation or to let them do the job themselves. By adopting first alternative we stand to earn resentment of Minister for Foreign Affairs, who up to now has been our friend, to have blame laid on us if anything goes wrong, to have (? separate) small and unwelcome contingents which (3 groups undecypher-able) &quot; side-backed &quot; in favour of Japanese troops, to risk another Tsingtao fiasco, to be asked to pay the piper if we call the tune.  By adopting second alternative
4we might, while gratifying Minister for Foreign Affairs, and so re-establishing cordial relations with him, leave Japanese Government to run the risk of incurring whatever misunderstanding or opposition might be aroused in Russia. We might look to Japanese Government to silence pro-German agitation with which we have been threatened if we should decline to trust their Government. When according to latter&apos;s request for permission to act alone we might take official note of Cabinet&apos;s declared intention to consult us before taking any action, and of their disclaimer of any design to &quot;conquer Russia.&quot; In a word, as it appears likely enough that Japanese will not hesitate to take independent action if they consider it desirable, and that we can do nothing to; stop them, we might make a virtue of giving way gracefully, and so have one less military anxiety upon our minds in coming months.o
