u* 1.SE0RBgG*T. -3413 gDMS PROPAGAmi.,Minute by Sir Edward Parson,With regard to Mr,Roberts&apos; paper (0.1,3360) on the necessity for providing additional means for disseminating information and for making the best information possible available to the purely local press, I circulate a memorandum by my Secretary, Mr.Wicks, covering a letter and scheme received from the Editor-in-Chief- of the War Aims Committee. ^Whitehall   Gar dens, S.W./1 (Sgd. )EDWAED CARSOU21st January,1918.Memorandum to Sir Edward Parson..  I attach a letter from Mr.Piennes, Editor-in-Chief of   the War Aims Committee, with reference to the Paper by the Minister of labour (G.T.3360)   on the importance of guiding the local news-papers throughout the country.    As appears from the letter a very great deal has already been done in this direction and further stops are being taken.     I also attach a Memorandum by Mr.iliennes giving the outline of a scheme which I discussed with him last week for securing more effective publicity at home.    The main points are as follows(1) For&apos;the purpose of steadying public opinion and allaying labour Unrest, propaganda in the form of a direct appeal to patriotism is not nearly so effective as the publication in an attractive form of information and instruction about the War, its incidents, and its effects, together with an explanation of the causes which have necessarily produoed the various shortages and discomforts to whioh the flation is being subjected and the steps which are being taken to alleviate them.    Our greatest enemy is ignorance and the spread of information is more effactivs than appeals to $ triotism which fall on dsaf ears because they are not understood;(Z) The newspaper offices are flooded with material relating; to the.activities of Government Departments.    Various Government Departments have their own publicity organizations which are oom-peting with one another for spaoe in the newspapers without co-ordination-and without regard to the relative importance of their respective announcements.(3) In consequence, owing to the shortage of paper and this lack of co-ordination, the newspapers receive for more material than they can use and important matters of Government policy are not given the prominence they deserve;(4) The Scheme is shortly,to establish a Publicity Office under an Editor vho would have the assistance of a representative from each of the Departments which is at present carrying on a Publicity Campaign. &apos; All announcements would go from the Depart-ments to this Office, where they would be sub-edited and co-ordina-ted so as to make it possible for the newspapers to handle them properly;(5)Mr.Fiennes suggests that this Publicity Office should be a home.section of the Department of Information,     This would necessitate a separate Tote in the House of Commons and I suggest that as the Publicity Office will not be concerned with propaganda
*a such, but with the issue of War Dot/s and information from Government Dei*ejrtm0nt8tit could quite properly be set up as a Branch of the iress Bureau^and go on the Home Office Vote,(Sgd.) PEMBROKE f/ICKS81st January,1918,54, Victoria Street. 20th January,1918My dear Wicks,I send you herewith my Memorandum on a swreested schema for dealing with the Press. ^ scnenetii- Pnt?

But the work will be much mare thorough and effective if they will, and I am sure the Press will look upon us with a far more favourable eye,I agree entirely with what Mr,Hoberts sajzs as to the need for a   much fuller and franker disclosure of information on the part of the Government Pepartraents.    You have seen some of the difficulties with which I have been ft ced from the reluctance of the Authorities to permit publication,    I may say that I have been trying to get the very information which 5Mr JRoberts suggests concerning the proceedings of the Bolsheviks, but have been inf that it is not in the national interest that it should be made public.     Unless this reluctance is broken down, I fear we shall do little with the Press,I will send you on the other Memorandum as soon as it is typSuggestions for Assisting the Press in Dealin7&quot;ith (government Int&apos; ormation.It is unnecessary to dwell upon the difficulties under which the Press of the country is at present labouring.    They may be briefly summed up as follows:- Shortage of labour;   scarcity of paper;   over-abundance of undigested information from Government Departments;   stricture in the neve channels, and retardation in the machinery of communication.At the same time, there is an almost universal sense that a better diffusion of information among the people is necessary in the national interest.As the result of three month*s experience as Director of the Publicity Department of the National War Aims Committee, during which time the Department, has dealt ?:ith s.cme thing like seven hundred newspapers, daily and weekly, both in London and the Provinces, I beg to submit the foilovang proposals which J believe would be of advantage both to the Government and to the Press:-Sincerely yours,(Sgd,) GEPcAHD TOS,
(1) That the Publicity Department of the National War Aims Committee be expanded into the Home Section of the Department of Information.     It would continue to discharge jts function of supply-, ing the National oar Aims Committee with the leaflets, etc. required; but it would be rendered more acceptable to the Press by the change of name.(2) That the Publicity Departments of such Government Offics^ as maintain them be co-ordinated and brought under the said Home Section of the Department of Information, in order that the matter which it is desired to issue to the Press should be pro-digested and issued in the form likely to be most palatable,(3) That bhe Press be assisted to meet its difficulties in the matter of labour and scarcity of paper by the supply&apos;of material through the Department, either in the form of stereo, or of a ready-? printed Supplement, as desired.The Press may be roughly divided for this purpose into the following categories(1) The morning papers, London and Provincial, the London evening papers, and Sunday papers like the Observer and Sunday Times, which are in the category of daily papers, though printed only once a week.(Z) The provincial evening papers.(3) The Provincial weekly papers which print on rotary presses -roughly, those which have a circulation of 10,000 copies and above, and the Sunday papers w&amp;Lch are of a weekly rather than a daily character.(4) The smaller Provincial weeklies.(5) The religious, family, technical and trade papers, which form a section which need not be further considered here.Group (1) would &amp;: best be dealt with by the issue of a daily Budget in galley-proof, containing the matter it is desired to cir-culate, duly sub-edited and prepared for the Press, to be used at the discretion of the Editors.Groups (2) and (3) might be dealt with according to a scheme already being worked out by the issue of matter in stereo.Group (4) should be supplied with a ready-printed supplement for use as an inset. This form is not convenient to papers which print on rotary presses, ?.s the folding is there done by machinery.It is hoped that this plan would not only ensure good publicity for ttie Government and a wider diffusion of information and pro pagan-da throughout the country, but wouH also prove popular with the  . Press, which would be an advantagein the following waysThe first group would save labour in tho sub-editors1 room and be spared the moral and intellectual damage caused by the present bombardment from all quarters with matter, often of little news in-terest, but claiming insertion on national grounds;   the second group would also save labour in the composing room;   the lest group would share in the foregoing advantages, and psuld also obtain, in effect, an additional aiid gratuitous paper ration.    Many of these smaller papers, which are   an invaluable medium for reaching the people, have been cut to pieces by war conditions, and at present contain little, if anything,   beyond local news.    If the scheme is to prove really successful, the Department must concern itself with getting news and other interesting matter from the quarters which
arc able, to supply it, and there must be a greater disposition shorjn in those quarters to enlighten tho public.As regards cost, I an, naturally, not in a position to offc an estimate until I know how many papers are liekly to fall in wit tho scheme.      But I can state that the oo3t of supplying stereo ! matter and distributing it would be from 10/- to 12/6&amp; per column,1 As regards the printed Supplement, if the scheme now maturing goe through, it is hoped that practically the whole cost would bo pai for by advertisements.$he Departments, other than the National War Aims Committee which would be touched, by the scheme would be, I teke it, tho of Munitions. National Service Department, Board of Agriculture, Ministry of labour, Kinietry of Food (control and production), Ministry of Pensions, War Savings Committee, and MrJtfair^s Depart-ment of the Department of Information, so far as it touches Home affairs. Departments supplying information would be theAdmiralt War Office, and, perhaps also, the Department of Shipping, Ministi of PwOconstruction and Board of Education. The Press Bureau would also be relieved of a considerable part of tho work of distributic If these Departments would contribute pro rata to tho cost, the scheme might be financed without the nooessity of a fresh applioat to Parliament.The National Press Agency -is willing to take over the work of printing the special supplement, supplying the stereos and distributing the matter to the Proas.    If the Department was con-stituted, as proposed, as the Home Scotion of the Department of Information, the matter might be issued directly in its name. Otherwise, it mlffht be well to issue it as from the Press Bureau.As regards the method of working, I suggest that the Depart-meats included should transfer their Press representatives to 54,Victoria Street, if accommodation oan be found for them there. They would then&quot;prepare aaoh day the matter ifeich their department! desire to issue, in consultation with oaoh other and with the Hews Editor of the National War Aims Committee (Mr. J.Maynard Saundera), who shall be finally responsible for the make-up of the Oolumns, subject to reference to me on questions of general, as opposed to departmental, policy.    The supply of editorials and of natter of general interest wuld remain in my control.J^Maynard 3aunders. who had two years&apos; experience at thew.,3B Bureau b.*or. Joining ^ BteM. 8jg ae tae re^eAt ofthat bo(Jy&apos;anil be responsible for seeing thai; ail censure Die nat is Emitted to the proper authority.    The Department vould not of couSe* tSui lioial cwmmlwM or day-to-day mr ne^B eent out by the Press Agencies.I submit that such a scheme is infinitely preferable      *ha oft-suggested alternative of securing insertion of matter by Pgnrnt at advertisement rates, a proocding demoralising both to the Press and thTSblic!    Tf it develops successfully^tho^eat eiqpenditure ofmedium for reaching the public ear&apos; bo s^sibitutegTI beg to suggest that.r if the scheme BhoultJ. meet with the approval of the &apos;.far Cabinet, Conferences should at once be summoned first of the Departments concerned and then of the newspaper Proprietors1 Association, with Sir B.Carson or his representative and myself,in order that tho details may be satisfactorily worked out.(Sgd.)
