W$.th this object -.1 am anxious to publish in the Journal of the Board of Agriculture the facts contained in this Memorandum,    Before doing so, I wish to consult the Cabinet as to the advisability of publication,    The secondiI Memorandum (marked B,) contains fuller figures for the information of the Cabinet, which it is not proposed to publish.It is, in my opinion, imperatively necessary to bring&amp;. B, PROTHERO.January 24th, 1918.
lolA.LIVESTOCK   POLICY of theBOARD   OP   AGRICULTURE   AKP   FISHERIES.andTHE   MINISTRY   OF   POOD.1,   The Fundamental Facta of the Situation.     The total amount of feeding stuff &quot; &quot;available for livestock between 1st   January, 1918, and 1st September, 1918, in Great Britain is estimated as follows:-Tons.Oats, excluding seed ............... 720,000Tail and damaged wheat and barley...... 180,000Killers * offals.................. 730,000Oil cakes ....................... 300,000Other feeding stuffs, including brewers * offals, beans, peas, gluten feed, etc.. 160,000Total........2,090,000The normal consumption of feeding stuffs during the same period before the War was 6,000,COO tons.     It is estimated that the consumption during the same period of 1917 was 5,000,000 tons. The quantity available until harvest 1918 is, therefore, leas than  . one-third of the pre-war consumption, and much less than half last year!s consumption.2.     In view of these figures, it is obviously necessary that drastic changes should be made in methods of feeding livestook. The present rate of consumption oould, if continued, consume before the end of March the whole supply that will be available up to the end of August.3,    The general principles which have been decided upon by the Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food, after the most anxious consideration, are as follows:-(a) That tho first call upon the stock of concentrated food is due to the horses, so thnt farm work and transport may be maintained.(b) After the horses, it has been decided that cows actually in milk should have the next claim, because milk is absolutely&apos; indispensable for children and invalids.(c) The small quantity of concentrated food left over should be apportioned to the breeding stock.    With so short a food supply, some decrease in the total livestook of the country is necessary, but it is advisable that the decrease should be achieved by the slaughter of the older animals rather than by the cessation of breeding.(d) There is absolutely no concentrated food to spare forfattening^cattle and sheep.     Under these circumstances it will be impossible^duririg &quot;the winter to make beef and mutton which is fat in the commonly accepted meaning of the term. But on a liberal ration of roots and straw, with a little hay, cattle and sheep can be maintained, and will yield lean meat.    This is all we can hope for under the cdraimstenoea.4.     Summarising the quantities used for these various purposes,, the following figures are obtained:-
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS, January - August, 193.8.Horses.Tons.Farm Horses - 787,000 at 8 lb,* for 240 days 675,000Heavy Dray - 247,000 at 14 lb. for 240 days 370,000 Ponies and Cobs -   of 375,000 at 41b. for240 days............................... 40, 000Light Trade - 243,000 at 8 lb. for 240 days 208,000Thoroughbred Horses..............*........ 5,000Add 1 month&apos;s stock oats for September,say....................,............. 50,000Cattle.Milch Cows -2,000,000 at 4 lb. for 120 days 430,0002 lb. for   30 days 54,000484,000Calves - 1,000,000 at, say,   cwt. each ... 25,000Young Bulls - 30,000 at 3 lb. for 100 days 4,000Pi 8,Sows - 250,000 at 4 lb. for 70 days   ...... 31^0001 lb. for 170 days...... 19,0002^48,000513,00050,000Weaning Pigs - 2,000,000 1 cwt. each   .....        100,000Boars, say............................... 2,000Sheen.Breeding Ewes - 4,000,000 at 14 lbs. each 25,000Rams, say................................ 1,000152,00026,000Poultry, etc.Say..................................................        50,0002,089,0005. Horses.- It is estimated that the number of horses actually engaged in work on the farm in Great Brite,in is about 787,000, and that these horses can be maintained in work for the 240 days between 1st January and 1st September on an average ration of 8 lb. per head per day of concentrated food, or rather less than 1 ton for each horse.     This would allow a ration of 10 lb. per head per day until the grass comes again and at harvest, provided the ration is reduced to 5 or 6 lb. while the horses are turned out in the summer,* These quantities are not daily rations butaverage amounts for the whole period.
It will be noticed that the requirements of farm-horses are less than half the total requirements of all the horses in the country.     Every farmer should reckon how many tons of oats he requires to keep for his own horses at the rate of 19 cwt. per horse actually at work, and should add on to this quantity the amount he requires for seed.     The total so arrived at should be compared with the total oats he possesses, and the balance should be sold, so that it may find its way to the other classes of horses, which are indispensable for maintaining the work of the nation.     These other classes of horses include railway horses, pit ponies, and town delivery horses, which are just as indispensable as the horses on the farms.     A farmer who keeps back his surplus of oats, over and above the requirements for horses and milch cows indicated above, and feeds cattle or pigs with them will be not only wasting the resources of &quot;the country but will be elhlialigering its fighting power.6. Cattle.-   It is estimated that the number of cows actually in milk in Great Britain is almost exactly 2,000,000, and that the stock of food in the country will provide for each cow in milk an average ration of 4 lb, per day of cake and meal from 1st January until the grass comes.     During May, June, and July no concentrated food can be spared for milking cows, but they may got a ration of 2 lb. of cake per head per day when the grass begins to fail about the 1st August.To enable the farmers to fear ealves during the period before there is any grass for them, it will be possible to allow for each calf reared,   cwt. of concentrated food, which should with economy carry them on from weaning time until they can be turned out.It is also possible to spare a ration of 3 lb, a&quot;day of concentrated food for young bulls which are good enough to grow on.    No concentrated food can be spared for fattening cattle.7, Pigs,-   It is. estimated that the total number of breeding sows in Great Britain at the present time is about 250,000 and it is possible to spare for each of these about 4 cwt. of meal, which should be used to see them through the suckling period.It is also possible to allow 1 cwt. of meal for every young pig to carry it on from weaning time, and a small allowance can also be spared for boars.     After weaning, no meal can be spared for fattening.The production of fat pork for bacon is therefore impossible, but pig-keepers r.rc urged toraake every effort to grow pigs on roots and waste in the winter and on green stuff in the summer,8, Sheep,-   It is estimated that the number of breeding ewes in Great Britain of those breeds which are commonly weaned on arable land is about 4 millions, and it is possible to allow such ewes a ration of not more than   lb, per head per day of concentrated food for 4 weeks, which should see them through the bad weather after the lambing period.It is also possible to spare a very small quantity of concentrated food to ram lambs of these breeds,    No concentrated food can be spared for fattening either sheep or lambs.
9. Poultry.-   It is estimated that the consumption of corn by poultry before the War was not* far short of 500,000 tons. It is quite obvious that under the present circumstances no such amount can possibly be available, but a small allowance has been set aside for poultry, in order that good laying strains may be preserved.
