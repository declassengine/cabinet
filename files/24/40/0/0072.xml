(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic lv)ajesty&apos;s Government.)SECRET,Copy No.0.1/144/413.SUMMARY OF A REPORT ON THE SITUATION OF THE-ITALIAN ARMY M GEtiEiTAL FAYOLLE,56th   DECEMBER, lSJTTI.EFFECTIVES.Including the standing army under arms at the moment when war was declared, 4,350,000 officers and men have been enrolled since the beginning of the war.     Of this number 2,840,000 are still under arms, 2,010,000 being in the war zone.     After deducting the men in hospital and in reorgan-isation camps, and the troops in Macedonia and Albania, there remain about 1,600,000 of all ranks capable of being used at once on the Italian front.The Italian forces are grouped in 5 Armies (3 in the line, 1 in reserve and 1 composed of units in course of re-. Excluding the forces in Macedonia and Albania, there are 22 Army Corps, containing 50 Divisions,  (6 of which are reforming).The Staffs are energetic, but suffer from two defects  :-1.. Lack of organising capacity;-2.. Inability to adapt themselves to the circumstances of the present war.The resulting bad effects are as follows  :-1.     The necessity of keeping formations intact is not recog-nised.     Troops are frequently detached, without sufficient reason, from Divisions and even from brigades.-     The result is inefficiency in command, and Imperfect liaison between infantry and artillery.II.    ORGANISATION.organisation).III.    COMMAND AND STAFFS.
this2.      There is no proper system of reliefs.     Troops are left in dangerous sectors continuously until they are thoroughly worn out.3.      The defensive is not sufficiently distributed in depth. This is seen in two ways.      In the first place, there is a lack of defensive works in rear,, especially on those parts of the front where movement has recently taken place.       In the second, troops are massed in the front line in excessive numbers with insufficient reserves behind.4.      Artillery defence Is not properly understood.       There is imperfect liaison with the infantry, batteries are pushed too far forward, so that a slight enemy advance entails heavy loss in materiel, and not enough counter-battery work is done. 5.       The infantry do not understand the principles of the counter-attack.       Their local counter-attacks tend to be delivered too late (or not at all, owing to lack of reserves), their- methodical counter-attacks too hastily.IV.   MORALE oIn spite of the above defects in organisation, the spirit of the men is good, and they are capable of good results if better handled.The morale of the different armies varies considerably. The 3rd Army (from the sea to Nervesa) Y/as not badly shaken, by the Autumn retreat, and recovered itself quickly.       They live in comparative comfort behind a formidable obstacle.   The Command is energetically taking up the question of training.The 4th Army (from Monte Tomba to the Brenta) was greatly exhausted after the retreat, but recovered to a considerable extent after the taking over of part of its front by the British and French.       Recently it has fought well on the whole, though some units did badly.       Training is not possible for
this army.     All its energy is needed for maintaining its positions on the Grappa.The 1st Army (from the Brenta to Lake Garda) was hardly at all affected by the autumn retreat,     Nevertheless it has done very badly on certain occasions.     The troops massed on the Asiago plateau, with no regular system of reliefs, have suffered considerable hardships, which have no doubt impaired their resistance.    No measures have been taken to organise training.The 3rd Army Corps (West of Lake Garda) has enjoyed complete rest in strong positions, and is in good heartsTo sum up, the Armies in line are practically complete in effectives and equipment.    Their morale has risen consider ably since the retreat, aided by the arrival of allied troops, and is now good in the quiet sectors, though it can scarcely be relied upon to resist an attack.     Training has been neglected.Reserve Armies.The Second Army has two corps ready for the line, andxone which should be ready by 1st January. Here too, training has been almost entirely neglected.The Fifth Army is being reconstituted near Parma.     Its Commander is seriously engaged with the problems of training.V.   MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO COMPLETETHL- RE - ORGAN! SAT I ON OF THE ITALIAN ARMY .We can employ three methodsAdvi ce, Example Penetration.Advi ce must be given in the jnost tactful manner$ as the Italians take offence readily.    It has produced results, but only to a limited extent.Example,x Note.     Now ready - 26-1-18. &quot;   **
ar Office.27th January, 1918,Example.     The schools of the Xth French Army are in course of formation.   But even if Italian officers attend these schools regularly, the results will only reach the Italian Army at second hand,Penetration.   This is the best method of all,   A number of tactful and experienced French Officers should be attached to the Italian Army,     To make this measure more acceptable the French Army might receive Italian Officers in exchange.VI,    SUGARY OF CONCLUSIONS. The Italian Army possesses adequate resources**in personnel and materiel.    But it is imperfectly trained in the methods of present-day warfare, and its morale, though good, is unstable.   It is strong enough to hold its present front, but a collapse is not impossible. Such a collapse would have to be made good by the Franco-British forces, and in the most favourable circumstances it will probably not be possible, within a measurable period of time, to leave the Italian Army unsupported.
