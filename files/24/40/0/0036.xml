&apos;-^l   H!!l5nt is thefeel joup^^pperty ofREPORT ON OUTPUT OF MACHINES WITH A VIEW TO INCREASED OFFENSIVE AGAINST GERMAN TOWNS.2.Germany is at present being bombed from the Nancy area by one Handley*-Page Squadron (which is now short of three machines)   one F.S.2b Squadron (short distance nightflying only))   SI and one D.E.4 (R.R.) SquadronThe submarine bases at Bruges and Zeebrugge are being bombed by some Handley-Page machines from Dunkerque, and enemy aerodromes in the Ghent neighbourhood which aro used as the starting point for attacks on London arc also b&quot;ing bomb:d by F.E.2b*s.Ths increase of our offensive- against   Gorman touns d*p?nds upon:-(l)   tho output of completed machines.(2) The extent to which other claims upon the above output can be safely minimised or postponed.It must be remembered that at least two months are required after a new squadron is first formed in England before it can be regarded as sufficiently trained and equipped to work over the line.    At present,-none of tho machines which are being produced for bombing Germany are being utilised for training or for getting over &quot;teething&quot;-troubles, i,o,, for discovering tho imperfections which always 3hew themselves in new types and which have to be remedied especially with a now typa of engine, before they can be systematically put to work.     I am afraid that in view of the special difficulties of long journeys, often at nightj far iver enemy territory, this period of two months may prove too short in the case of long distance bombing machines.3. I took steps to ascertain specifically whatdeliveries of Handley-Pages and De Hav 9fs the D,G.ArP. could promise. *\so as to base my programme on them, and on January 11th I was furnished with tho following figures of prospective deliveries of machines:-Jan. Fob. k*ch. Apl. May. June.&quot; July. Aug. Septj HANDLSY-PAGS. -       5     21       TO     68       8 7       91       59&quot;&quot;DE HAV. 9 35     128 220   &apos;337     417   605     472     364     265in turn.I proceed to deal with these two rows of figures4.    Handley-PagesThe first 20 of these machines are fitted with engines (Sunbeams) which will not b; suitable for long distance bombing work, and deliveries of bombing machines will thoreforo begin with 6 Handloy-P ages in April, followed by 40 in Uay otc.     The first thing that must be done with these tb to fill up the depleted Squadron at Ochey and also the Units at Dunkerquo, which are bombing submarine basos.Subject to this and to the provision of machines every month for training and wastage (which of coUrs-e -absorb a larger number of machines as the total number of Bquadrons
grows] the whole of tho balance will bo us:-d for forming additional squadrons^ and two months lat3r I hope that thos squadrons Will be actually engaged in the work of bombing Germany as follows:^Han dl ey^Page b1 Squadron at full strength t! n2 Handley-Page squadrons 5By April		30 th?!	.May	61stFl	June	30thII	July	31stII	Aug.	31stII	Sep.

The refitting of existing D.H*4 Squadrons is urgently necessary, but in order to push forward the creation of new bombing squadrons as rapidly as possible, these replacements have been minimised and delayed long past the point which would otherwise have been proper^It would not, in my opinion, be possible to postpone yet further compliance with the requirements rf tho Navyj the Expeditionary Force, and ihe Middle East.Tho deliveries of D.H.9*s.to be furnished by the Munitions Department^, as set out in paragraph 3 above,, will bo utilised as follows.; *The 35 promised for January (up to January 21st, only 2 pf these have been delivered) are required - apart from training&quot;- to maintain&apos; $aval Squadrons at Dunkerque and submarine spotting Unitse as the manufacture of D.H.4 machines, hitherto supplied to these Units, ceases.In subsequent months the replacement of other Squadrons, both Naval&apos;and Military, now equipped with D.H.4 machines has also to be provided for. but this replacement has been-postponed beyond the due date wherever possible in order to accelerate the formation of&apos;bombing squadrons *     In the same way squadrons for long reconnaissance and bombing&apos; work, which have been promised to tho Middle East Brigade over since October last;, have to be-provided;   at present the Middle East   Briga&amp;o have none.     The result is. that having regard to these other necessities, the- deliveries of D.E.9,s which are promised will provide squadrons for bombing Germany, which should bo actually engaged in that work as follows;.-De Havr, 9?s0By April I50.th, 1 De Hav* 9 Squadron&quot;   May 31s b &apos; 3   &apos;f   &quot;     r&apos; Squadrons&quot;   Juno&quot; 30-th 8   w   &quot;     &quot;       i!&quot;   July 31st 12   &quot;   ,!     &quot;       &quot;&quot;   Aug. 31st 17   ,J   &quot;     &quot;       &quot;&quot;   Sept. 30th 19 - &quot;   M     &quot;      &quot;There is, moreover, one D.K.4 Squadron already operating.If deliveries of machines and engines can be
expedited beyond, the promises now made so that Handley^ages and D9H.9*s may54bo turned out, complete in all respects^ more promptly, then it may lae possible to accelerate tho growth of the bombing squadrons, but from the experience of aviation production in all countries i am rather afraid that the dates of deliveries will bo postponed rather than ex^cditedji though everything possible will be done. 1 am afraid it is impossible to ask squadrons to ^g* over the line that are nrft trained as squadrons *     To throw together a collection of machines &amp;nd mechanics at the la3t juCment end to expoo$ them tc work as a equadrcn in flights in proper f rmati-n is to attempt an impossibility.The relation between production, and fighting -Strength is now well established, hot only theoradically, but in the light of cur actual experience; wastage and the consequent necessity cf renewal are bound tc continue to be a serious drain on production, and these have to be pre-vided against befcre expansion is possible.Our experience of the rate of wastage of long** distance bcmbing machines is, of course, much more slight, but X have assumed,, for the purpose of these Sal cu tali ens, ^\re^t figures for vrastage than havs been taken for scouts or artillery machines *    2 feel confident that in rlew of the production premised, and the necessaijy claims muz that product ion4) the increase of our bombing squadrons eo 23$$ be expected to be greater than what is set out aboVdo
