HIS Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. VBM/020.:J. TOEKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA. XX.21, 1918).As the Sabraniye was in session throughout the greater part of the month of December there has been considerable activity in Bulgarian. Internal politics since December 3, when the last Report was issued.   Still more Important, however, has been the participation of Bulgaria In the peace negotiations of the Central Powers with Russia, and the bearing of these on Bulgaria1 s attitude to the continuance of the war.    The debates in the Sabraniye may be-oonsldered first.Debates in the Sabraniye.Throughout the session the Opposition--has been very active in criticism of the Government4 s proposals,    The Minister of Finance, Tonehev, introduced the 1918 Budget on December 3 and endeavoured to represent the finanoial position of Bulgaria in a rosy light.     The estimated revenue amounted to 431,948,000 leva, estimated expenditure to 477,605,205;   and while revenue from Indirect taxation had decreased from 209 million leva to 116 million.it was hoped that the proposed nex tax on war profits would bring in120 million leva.   The Bulgarian National Debt on December 31, 1917,would amount to 1,$02,313,991.17 leva (consolidated), and floatingdebt to 2,865,563,087:   total debt on December 31, 1917, wouldamount to 4,667,877,078.17 leva1;   expenditure for war purposes2would come to at least a milliard leva .    Tonchev dwelt on the amount that had been saved by the population in the period 1914-171.   Roughly  187 million.2.   Roughly  40 million.
1.    29 million.2.which he put at 672 million leva,1 all lodged in State hanks; together with savings in private banks they might amount to a milliard leva.   Tonchev1s rosy picture of the prosperity of the population, particularly the agrarian classes, Is probably, though exaggerated, in the main correct, but it was not greeted with much satisfaction by Opposition speakers.TonchevTs two proposals for dealing with the serious1 financial position were (1) the export of vast quantities of tobacco abroad with a view to improving the rates of exchange, and (2) proposed taxation of war profits.    Opposition speakers, however, pointed out that the prospects for after the war were most disquieting. The Budget passed its first reading on December 15, but the financial measures proposed are unlikely to be carried without considerable further opposition during the discussion on the Budgets of the various Government departments.The Government proposal that the new commercial treaty with Germany should not come into force till the end of 1919 or some date before that  provided the war was&apos;over, also provoked con-siderable discussion.    Most of the Opposition1s criticism, however, apparently merely expressed the irritation ifolch was felt in Bulgaria at the country1s increasing dependence on German finance.The Food Question.Agrarian members attacked the Government for its mismanagement of the food question and declared that far less land had been put under cultivation than was possible and necessary.      The Government, of course, maintains that everything possible has been done;   for Instance, 7 million acres were sown with corn in 1917
and the total yield was approximately 2,700,000 tons.   In the old Bulgarian Kingdom 2i million acres were sown with wheat and li million with maize.   Meanwhile the shortage of food stuffs continues in the towns.   From December 1 on customers in restaurants must supply their own meat.    There are four meatless days in the week, while the allowance of meat per person on the remaining thBee days is fixed at 200 grams, whilst the daily bread allowance is 400 grams.    Meanwhile measures are once more being taken to evacuate the floating population from Sofia,War Aims.In previous Reports it has been shown that the Bulgarian Government, backed by politicians and press of practically all . parties, some time ago passed from vague clamours for the &quot;completion of Bulgarian union&quot; to the concrete demand that all the occupied territories, consisting not only of Serbian but of Greek Macedonia and, further, Old Serbia up to the Prizren-Prishtina-Nish line, North-East Serbia East of the Morava River, and the whole of Dobrogea, should be formally claimed by the Bulgarians. In the recent debates in the Sabraniye this demand was once again put forward and received the complete endorsement of the Opposition speakers.    The Geshovist Todorov, for instance, In his speech an December 8, demanded the whole of Dobrogea and Greek Eastern Macedonia in order that Bulgaria should secure a &quot;sufficient facade&quot; on the Aegean Sea.    The same demands were made by Democrat and Broad Socialist speakers.   Radoslavov summed it all up in his official declaration on December 1 by saying that the reason for Bulgaria1^ intervention in the war had been justified, viz. the unification of the Bulgarian nation in a single State embracing Macedonia, the Morava country and Dobrogea.
1 106-   4.To secure these gains permanently, however, Bulgaria has to look for support to European fewers.    It is true that with Germany she has a Treaty, signed in 1915 before her intervention in the war, assuring her of considerable territorial advantages.    The terms of this Treaty have not been published, but it seems clear from the assurances of the German Government to Bulgaria at the time of the Wendel controversy that Germany promised Bulgaria Macedonia, both the unocntested and the contested zone of the Treaty of 1912.    Since then there can be little doubt - and the conjecture is confirmed by our agents&apos; reports - that Germany has added to these concessions Greek Eastern Macedonia and Southern Dobrogea up to practically the Cemovoda-Conetanfca line. Presumably, Austria-Hungary, though not bound by any treaty* \would have no fundamental objection to Bulgaria securing these territorial gains.    But these promises do not in the least satisfy Bulgarian politicians.As has been pointed out in previous Reports, for a year or more past energetic efforts have been made to get rid of or Bulgariee the non-Bulgar populations of the Morava Valley and Dobrogea.     At the present time great attention is being devoted to the Morava Valley.    Visits have r ecently been paid it by the Minister of Education and the Bulgarian Metropolitan of Okhrida,    The Sabraniye recently voted a million leva as economic assistance to the district.   Great trouble is being taken to extend the wheat aid tobacco production of the district, and Bulgarian propagandists are active both in Bulgaria and abroad to show that the population has received the Bulgarian occupation with great satisfaction and that the risings of last spring were mere exploits of brigands who attacked and robbed the population loyal to the Bulgarian Government.
In the case of Dobrogea still more trouble is being taken.The Bulgarian press is every day full of articles insisting onBulgaria&apos;s historical and racial claims to the province.   Not eventhe most extreme Bulgarian propagandists can pretend that themajority of the population is Bulgar, but it is contended that downto 1878 there was a non-Ruman majority and that the fact that theRumanian Government imported Rumanian settlers and endeavoured toRumanise the province must not be allowed to tell in favour ofthe Rumanian demand.   The two principles of &quot;dis-annexations&quot; and&quot;self-determination of nationalities&quot; are invoked to justifyBulgarian claims in the eyes of Russian and other Socialists.To clinch the matter a sort of Constituent Assembly, called theCentral Council of Dobrogea, was brought together on December 18at Baba Dagh in Northern Dobrogea, which has always been theonly purely Bulgarian district of the province.   We are assuredby the Bulgarian press that all races, not only Bulgars, butTurks, Tatars, Jews and even Rumens, were represented in thistheyAssembly and that/unanimously demanded their liberation from Rumanian rule and union with the Bulgarian Kingdom.The object of all this propagandist work is two-fold. Firstly, to influence Russia and Entente opinion as to Bulgaria&apos;s right to the territories she has occupied by force.     It must not be forgotten that the Bulgarians generally are under the impression (1) that the Entente Powers are, as a whole, quite ignorant as to local conditions In remote parts of the Balkans and will believe in &quot;facts&quot; supplied to them if plausibly put;   (2) that the Entente Powers, though they make a great show of insistence on principle, are in fact as opportunist in policy as is the Bulgarian Government itself.     As the Bulgarians, further,&quot;
are under the impression that the Entente Powers now realise the impossibility of winning the war, - it may be noted in this connection that Lord Lansdowne!s letter in the Daily Telegraph was taken by the Bulgarian press merely as a cry of despair -the Bulgarian nation is optimistic as to securing its demands.Secondly, in putting forward their demands the Bulgarians are trying by every means to bring their Allies, Germany end Austria-Hungary, to their own point of view.    As to Germany the chief difficulty is Northern Dobrogea.     Intense uneasiness wasexpressed in Bulgaria as to the possibility of Rumania being pardoned for her crimes aid allowed to retain the greater part of Dobrogea.   This was a discreet form of allusion to ihe intrigues (discussed in the last Rumanian Report) which Germany is con-templating with Rumania.     &quot;It is hoped&quot;, writes Mr Dimchev in the Mir, &quot;that Bulgaria1s Allies will lend their energetic support to Bulgaria1 b interests rather than to those of Rumania&quot;.    As yet, however, no tangible satisfaction has been got from Germany as to this demand, and there seems no doubt that German diplomacy is still dangling before Rumania and Bulgaria alike the bait of Northern Dobrogea.As to Austria-Hungary, the reason for disagreement is still more well-founded.   Austria objects to the Bulgarian demands for two reasons.    In the first place, because they are held to be a bar to peace, which, according to Count Czernin, ought to be on the basis of &quot;no annexations&quot;;   and secondly, because Austrian statesmen wish the road to the Balkans to be in   their own hands, passing through Jugo-Slav territority, and have no wish to see Bulgaria controlling the territory 1inking^Bulgaria with Hungary. Further, both in Germany and in Austria-Hungary suspicions are entertained as to the dangers which might arise if territorial
contact wei*e established between Bulgaria and Russia through Bulgaria&apos;s annexation of the whole Dobrogea.An Interesting indication of the fundamental disagreement of the two points of view is supplied by the interview with TsarrFerdinand published by Professor Adolf Straus in the Neue Freje preBse of December 25, 1917, where the Tsar summed up Bulgaria1s demands in this form:   &quot;Bulgaria still to-day holds to the baBis of that Treaty (1912/13 Treaty) which was sealed and sworn by her then Allies, who are now her chief enemies&quot;.     (The Treaty of 1912 only assured Bulgaria of Macedonia (and, of course, Southern Dobrogea, then in her possession) and did not contemplate in the least what is now demanded:   Old Serbia, the Morava Valley and Northern Dobrogea).    Ferdinand&apos;s statement caused consternation in Bulgaria where it was promptly contradicted.   Radoslavov in the Sabraniye on December 30 deolared in answer to a question of one of the Opposition members that the words attributed to the Tsar by Professor Straus were not accurate and did not truly reflect the Monarch&apos;s views.     On December 29 Straus hastened to correct what he had written to &quot;Bulgaria to-day no longer holds to....&quot;    This interview may be variously interpreted. If Ferdinand said Tftiat he did he was either (1) attempting to conciliate Austrian support for the minimum of Bulgarian demands, passing over for the moment any extra claims she might subsequently make;   or (2) he was anxious to &quot;draw&quot; the Bulgarian Government and Opposition and so show his Allies that it was not he but the whole Bulgarian nation that was making annexationist demands. It is possible, however, that it is professor Straus or.the Neue Freie Presse which is responsible for the original version. Neither the reporter nor the paper is likely to have been careless on such a matter, and if they Intentionally distorted the Tsar&apos;s
words it may have been as a significant hint to the Bulgarians that Austrian support of their demands would not go beyond the terms of the 1912 Treaty,   In any case, Bulgarian intrigues with and against her Allies continue to be as interesting as are Bulgarian attempts to represent their cause in such a way as to secure support in America and Western Europe,Peace Negotiations.Radoslavov announced In the Sabraniye on December 1: &quot;Bulgariahas always wished, in agreement with her Allies, to initiate peacenegotiations as soon as the proposal should arrive from herenemies. &apos; She showed this by her Note on December 1916 and by herreply to the Notes of Wilson and the Pope,     Such a proposal hasnow been addressed to us by the head of the Government of theCRussian Republic, Lenin, and by the People!s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, Trotski,   Faithful to our attitude we immediately replied that we were willing to enter into negotiations&quot; (loud applause). He then went on to state what has been quoted above as Bulgaria1 s minimum demands in the matter of territory.   The announcement was greeted with great satisfaction by the Sabraniye, but the same satisfaction was not shown with the fact that the negotiations and the appointment of plenipotentaries were to be left entirely in the hands of the Bulgarian Government.    Unfortunately there is little sign that the initiation of peaoe negotiations with Russia is being accompanied in Bulgaria by a more conciliatory frame of mind.     The Bulgarian press of all parties merely considers that peace with Russia would be valuable to them because it would be a good weapon against the Entente and might ultimately lead &amp;o the overthrow of their two great bugbears,
Mr Lloyd George and M. Clemenceau, for whom they have a peculiar dislike.   The only people in Bulgaria who show any real enthusiasm for the principles enunciated by Mr Trotski are the Narrow Socialists and sections of the Agrarian party, both of whom are fundamentally pacifist by temperament and policy and, further, have a strong interest in the overthrow ot the existing regime in Bulgaria and the establishment of a Balkan Republican Confederation.   According to a report emanating from the jro-German Swiss paper Per Bund a separate peaoe was concluded on January 8 between Russian and Bulgarian representatives, but of this there is as yet no official confirmation and it seems on the face of it that it is most unlikely.   The breakdown of negotiations between Trotski and the central Powers would have the most valuable effect in Bulgaria (1) because it would convince the Bulgarian nation as a whole *that the Central Powers are not in a position to secure acknowledgment of the victory they claim to have won;   (2) because it would reinforce the growing opposition in the country, led by the Narrow Socialist and Agrarian parties, to the chauvinistic policy of the Bulgarian Government which, it would then become clear, is standing in the way of the peace which Is longed for by the people of the country as a whole. Such a situation, if, as is most probable, it shortly arises, will offer the Entente Powers an opportunity of for the first time conducting an energetic moral offensive in Bulgaria;   but only the clear victory of democratic principles over militarism would provide such an opportunity.22.1.18.
