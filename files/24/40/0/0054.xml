Protest by Committee on Production regarding recent statement to the Press by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Munitions*The attention of the Committee on Production has been drawn to a report of a letter addressed to hiss constituents by the Parliamentary Secretary to tho Ministry of Munitions in which the 12-J- per cent bonus scheme is dealt with.    The letter states that &quot;the wages of the majority of munition workers, even with 12-g- per cent addedj have not done more than keep pace with the increase in the cost of living&quot; and that in consequence of the new bonus &quot;the reasonable demands of the munition workers for a remuneration adequate to their efforts and to the cost of living have been met by the Government&quot;.Statements like these by responsible members   of the Government oannot fail to compromise gravely the position and authority of the Committee on Production and other Arbitration Tribunals appointed under the Munitions Acts.It is well known thai under agreements in the Engineering and the Shipbuilding Trades arrangements had been made for the periodical review of wages in these trades at intervals&apos; of four months by the Committee on production. Awards had been given on that basis bringing up the general advance to 20/- per week.    That figure was arrived at after very careful consideration and in the great munitions&apos; trades (engineering/ shipbuilding, ironfounding, explosives, chemicals etc.) there is every ground for saying that the advance of 20/-per week has been accepted as a fair and reasonable settlement of the olaiijs in respect of the increased cost of living, andthere /
there is no reason to suppose that any further claim on those grounds would have been made at any rate before the proper time fixed under the agreement for the next review.Mr. ICellawayfs letter pays no regard whatever to these agreements and the inference drawn from his letter is almost bound to bo that the Government considered that there was a case for granting concessions to the workpeople on the grounds of cost of living in excess of the grants made by the Committee on Production.   Suoh a statement is bound to undermrtno the position of the arbitration Tribunals and to make It very much more difficult for the Departments concerned with the administration of the Tribunals&apos; awards to see that these awards are accepted];(SIGHED)   H.
