QtMd $am[TMs Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governinent.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1918.3I CIRCULATE a memorandum prepared by Sir Laming Worthington-Evans.January 28, 1918.A serious position is arising as the result of the refusal, of the New Issues Committee of the Treasury to allow the issue of fresh capital by certain companies, whose production is particularly important to the Ministry of Munitions. In several oases, particulars of which have been placed before the Treasury, the action of the New Issues Committee has held up important supplies, and is preventing necessary ertensions of works and development of resources. The cases referred to concern the production of aircraft, iron-ore mines, lead, tungsten ore, potash, fuel oil, and acetone.While I agree that the New Issues Committee have the duty of. protecting war loans from competitive issues, I think there is money available for speculative issues which, is not attracted by war loans ; if the New Issues Committee would allow issues of shares by aircraft companies and by companies requiring capital for extension of raining and certain industrial, chemical, and alloy steel processes, the speculators&apos; money would be brought to the service of the State and relieve the Ministry of the necessity of making advances to such companies, advances which have to come out, of proceeds of war loans.I would ask for an instruction from the War Cabinet that in cases where, for reasons of supply, the Ministry desire that a company should be allowed to make certain developments involving a fresh issue of capital or rearrangement of capital, and where, for reasons of finance, the New Issues Committee are unable to give consent to such fresh issue or rearrangement, an appeal should lie to a member of the War Cabinet, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister of Munitions.January 28, 1918.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.o
