Colonel JonegSECRET.19i^^-^^^^QL9W ----- -^^HAT^^R   C A B O 1 T*(fProHslon Uf7over s ea Gar ri sons after the War.263Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.The Army Council are giving attention to the question of the composition and size of the Military tforsea whioh it will &quot;be necessary to maintain after the war for the security of the British Umpire,   The question depends on others involving matters of policy, such as the Terms of Peace, the national xrill in regard to compulsory and other forms of service and tHe like,1 the decisions In regard to -which it is impossible now to forecast.   In due oauffse proposals will be made by the Council to meet the probable requirements, or the actual roquirsKuwrta if they are known,   %% is, however, not likely that conditions in wjiiah it will be profitable to make these proposals will be reached for tome time after the w*r. In the meantime peace will impose upon the Council a difficulty which it is imperative that they should he prepared beforehand to meet.   The Oversea Garrisons are supplied       almost entirely Iqt non-regular troops.   It will not be safe to withdraw these troops until thoir reliefs are available, and it is inetaabent on the Council to be iready when peace comes to supply t&amp;e latter at cnae in order to avoid delay in the repatriation of the Territorials etc., now manning the garrisons.   At the moment there are less than ICO,OOO men with a liability to serve beyond the duration of the war.   As the war goes on this is a constantly diminishing number, e.g. by Oetobor next it will be about 85,000.   Also it contains a large proportion of Warrant and H*C4Q8 of whom a large ntmber arc engaged in administrative work outside Regimental Sstablish-ments.   The Oversea Garrisons before the war numbered about 110,000 and it is clear to the ^ouneil that even after making allowance for those who will be forthcoming out of nunbers at present available for the purpose, it will take very nearly 100,000 if not more, to make up the units required for the release of the Territorials etc.The Council propose to call for Volunteers from the present armies to engage for short terms of servioe after the war. They intend to accept unmarried men only, unless a sufficient number of that class cannot be procured, to distribute them amongst the various ranks ap by investigation of the state of tho units may be shown to be required, and if necessary to vary the terms of servioe for whioh they are asked tc volunteer so as to avoid a wholesale depletion of the units at any time, but to require every man volunteering to de so for &quot;general service.*The Council anticipate that the first question that will be asked is. What rate of pay can bo promised?  Will the reoently inoreased rates se continued?   Seme inducement to volunteer will be necessary, and while the Council are proposing to bring home first for furlough after peace those who are to serve en afterwards which will be a strong inducement to many, they feel that this will not suffioe to procure the requisite maabcrs.   3Tor indeed does it supply ar. answer to the dominant question as to pay.   They feel that nothing short of continuance of the present rates of pay win secure, or indeed will be more than a just recompense for, continued servise and they submit tc^ the Cabinet that they be authorized to offer these^t^frmTT^^ make it clearthat the arrangement is purely temporary and that the present rates are not to be held to be those of the Army whioh, in due course, the Government of the day may decide to organize for futurepermanent
p-ermanent needs.   Before the reoent decision was taken to increase the pay, the Council were considering the necessity of recourse to the payment of &quot;bounties whioh has heen the normal form of pecuniary inducement to extensions of servioe.   But they are not proceeding with this investigation of the possibility of achieving their object by this method pending decision on the proposals they now make,(Sgd,)   Derby,26th January, 1918,
