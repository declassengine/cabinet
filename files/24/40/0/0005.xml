BARBER, St. Michael1s Avenue, YBOVIL.Bear Sir and Brother,I have been asked by our Branch Committee to enquire what steps you propose taking with regard to the &quot;Comb out&quot; of skilled engineers as suggested by Sir A. Qeddes.   This branch is taking steps to resist any such action, and resolutions have been forwarded to BiCto this effecti and we should be glad if other branches would do the same, as this comb-out is in our opinion an attempt i?o smash skilled trade-inionism besides involving a further loss of life without furthering the ends of Democracy, It will also seriously hinder any future labour movements by thinning our ranks so that later on action will be impossible.   Anything that is done if this comb-out is insisted upon should be organized and take place at the same time everywhere to be effective.   We consider this should be kept to a Committee to avoid leakage outside the trade by the younger members of our Society.   Our best&quot; ywishes for the success of your Branch and awaiting an early reply.Yours fraternally,(SgdJ &apos;    J. BARBER.I Secretary,Please pass this on to the nearest Branch*
The -^SocJuertjr^was- jrepreeented at the conference convened by the Ministry cf National -Service to consider the question of man-power by the Executive Council, who attended the first session on Thursday, 3rd. January, but did not attend the two subsequent sessions.The statements made by Sir Auckland G-eddes in regard to additional m&amp;h being required for . general military service, many of whom must necessarily be drawn from munition works, railways, and collieries, involve a departure from the agreement entered into between the Government and the Society,   Under these circumstances, the Executive Council refused to be a party to any decisions of the conference that would affect pledges given, and have communicated with the Ministry of National Service to that effect, and request that further negotiations must take place between the Society and the Government if a satisfactory conclusion ie to be reached in regard to this question.I am,Yours faithfully,(Sgd.)     tkl -. B301VN1IE.Chairman, Executive CouncilJanuary, 1918.
CONFIDENTIAL.LEICESTER. 12.1.18..1 have received reliable and definite information which leads me to believe that the A;S.Ei have already started to play the same game over the proposed new Schedule as they played over the old one last April and May.   The procedure appears to be as follows:-     The delegate&amp;in London, While appearing to agree with the Government in a new Schedule, are instigating their iocal Secretaries to give the tip to the shop stewards to stir up the men - especially the younger ones -&quot;against the arrangements made,&apos;in the hope that they will later on be able to obtain special concessions because the men will not agree.It has already happened in this district that young men with *AT cards intelligently anticipating events have proposed to join the Army forthwith and have gone so far as to get medically examined but have then been prevented by the shop stewards and secretaries from volunteering lest the case of the men as a body might be prejudices!.&apos; You may bossibly know that this is going on but I felt it important to send you this warning at ohce so that any steps pbssible may be taken to consider such underhanded proceedings,
Of course I do not know exactly what negotiations preceded Instruction 12. last year but I understand the argument was that the sh*p stewards and men did not agree with the aotion taken by their delegates.   If this were the case it is significant that in this part&apos; of the world the delegates all managed to keep their positions and are again representing the men at the conferences.
