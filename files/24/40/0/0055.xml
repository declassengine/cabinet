VThfs Document is the Property ofHis Britannic (Vlajesty&apos;s Government.)tot a &quot; &quot;Jjesty&apos;s Government * &apos;T0NNAQ5   FOR   FOOD.ORANDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLER.At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 24th January when the Ministry of Shipping Memorandum (G.T.3388-of 18th January) was under, discussion, I pointed out that while the Ministry of Shipping had gone a*long way to give practical effect to the priority for food stuffs laid down by the Cabinet, their proposals, in the Memorandum referred to, did not fully meet the requirements of the Ministry of -Food. -In the present note I set out three points in which thesey &quot; &quot;requirements are not met.1. \ Tho February requirements of the MinistfiK stated tto be 93,500 shipping tons, . r  ;In fact the normal February programme excluding, cargo to bem \4carried in refrigerated space and the requirements of the Army Canteen and lfavy amounts to .U.S.A. 71,840   nett tons- Canada 16,100   nett tons87,940   nett tons or 102,500 ^_ &apos; shipping tons.2.     The above figures make no provision for an additional quantity of 67,000 tons of Bacon which Mr. Hoover has offered and for which the necessary finance has been specially arranged,3.     No provision is made for making up in February the serious deficiencies in quantities loaded in January,In the case of bacon,, for instance, it appears probable that the total January shipment from North America will not exceed 15,000 tons, barely more than is needed to cover the monthly Army requirements,   I have been compelled as a consequence to postpone the introduction of the Bacon distribution Scheme from February 1st to march l3t as there will be very little bacon to distribute i&apos;o the civilian population before the latter date.
I recognise that the present short shipments are largely due to the internal conditions prevailing in the United States, and it is particularly Important that some form of priority for all food stuffs and not merely fer cereals should be given ever to the American-Railways,The triie February requirements of the Ministry are (excluding Cereals)Gross Shipping tonsNormal programme as above 102/500Proportion of extra Bacon     -    1   45,500 * -say40,000 net tons-    - .   .     149,000    -Against provided by&apos; theMinistry of   Shipping   \. * J?5;.5C0-55j500Now that the Restriction of Imports Committee have been asked to re-assemblep I prrn^pse ,to: bring the points mentioned above before them at the first opportunity, and I assume that it is within their competence to deal with these&quot;points.RH0NDD A.&apos;MINISTRY OF FOOD, 25th January 1918.
