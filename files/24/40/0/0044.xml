N. V35orTh?s Doccument Is the Proper^ofThe Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office,,London, S ,W *NAVAL Id TINY AND COUNTER-REVOLUTION. 7th January,, 1918*^ffifyr In continuation of my telegram No. 728 of 9th instant, I beg to forward the following notes1,     The personnel cf the Navy with the exception of theofficers had shewed great discontent since the Revolution of December 6th, 1917.against the forces of Sidonio Paes, now the Government, because they were told they were Monarchists *Lisbon without rifles when the present temporary Government had succeeded in taking charge of the State *They heard that they were to be sent to East Africa and their ships distributed at various ports.2,     The real cause of discontent is that they failed in their fight against Sidonio Paes en December 7th and were very sore on trie point especially as they were being jeered at and were ready to get up a fight against the Military forces who had defeated them previously.,   The counter-revolution evidently made use of them.   The Government of Sidonio Paes were aware of this and ordered the disarmament of the sailors.Those on shore resisted but surrendered at 6 a.m. on 8th instantcTheir grounds for discontent were:-That they were misled by their leaders and foughtThey were also insulted by being made to march through

Tile cruiser &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; v/as taken over by some rriutineers and fired 6 or 8 shells about 11 a.m. on the 8th and was replied to by field guns from Port St. George, some of which hit the ship and about 12 noon she surrendered.4*     There was also some sympathy shewn with the mutineers by the 2nd Regiment and civilians.     Some of the officers of the Regiment were arrested.5*     Reports state that members of the former Government had incited this rebellion and were waiting the result in Spain near the frontier (not verified).The Carbinario, or secret police were paid by the former Government and are unpopular with the troops ,   Some of those carbinarios have now been disarmed and captured as they were actively assisting the counter-revolution?.o0     The country appears to be supporting the, Government of Sidonio Paos; even the Monarchists appear to be favourably disposed towards it.   Bankers ar$ said to be satisfied with the financial measures taken by Sidonio Paes Government*(Sgd.) N.W. Barnardiston* Major General.The British Military Mission.,Lisbon. 11th January, 1918.
