SECRET.Extract &quot;from a letter from General Ltilne ] tr,IKtj,, Salonika^ dated 30th December, 1917, addressed to theC.I.G.S.x x x x x x x&quot; I think you can rest assured that the arrival of General Guillaumat will, to a great extent, tend to ease the situation so far as this theatre of war is concerned. He has been here already only a few days, but appears to have got a very fair grip of the situation.   He has brought an up-to-date Chief of Staff with him who seems to know his work as a soldier; a new French General has arrived to take command of the French Army and I believe a new French Corps Commander is already en route.   During the past few days we have been exchanging official visits and the usual international courtesies.   But this afternoon we got down to business.   He very frankly read me out his instructions from the Allied War Council and then discussed the various means of putting these instructions into effect. Generally speaking, I am in agreement with his views.   Y&amp;iether or not I shall always be so I cannot say, but 1 do at least feel that there is a strong hand at the helm and that all orders given will form part of a general scheme, and will not toe merely the whim of a moment.   At present it is impossible for me to say definitely what his plans for defence generally are, as his ideas must be considered from many points of view before definite action can be taken, but, at any rate, for the future the action of the various armies will be co-ordinated? future events will be considered and preparations made to meet them.     This, as you know, is what I have always been striving for.Generally speaking, our front lines, being the strongest, will be our main line of defence and the necessary measures will be arranged to prepare for any change inthat
that line due to a hostile attack having broken through it in any one point.   Lines of retirement on Northern Greece and on Salonika will be worked out, intermediate positions considered, more especially on those allied fronts which have not yet considered them, and a rear line of defence decided on.   The value of the entrenched camp at Salonika as part of this rear line Trill receive due consideration.-   In this respect I have asked Plunkett to find out if there is any possibility of any old heavy guns, such as up to date have been used in coast defence, being made available for sending out here to strengthen the artillery defences of the entrenched camp. Possibly there are some of these guns available in England or even in Malta or Egypt.I hope that once General Gulllaumat has communicated his plans and intentions you will be more at ease as regards military arrangements in this theatre, but I am much afraid that Greece Is only going to be another mill-stone round the allied necks, and that while British and French Divisions have got to remain here defending it, you are not going to get much value out of the country, if any, for the allied cause.   Possibly we may detain the Bulgarian Army on this front, but I doubt whether the Bulgarian Army would ever go and fight on another fronts What is already mobilised of the Greek Army may be of some use, but the advent of the new army seems very doubtful, and in fact, I have a message from the Greek authorities to the effect that no concentration of new troops can be expected before the end of March,   So much for the future,     After two years of uncertainty it is a change to have someone with a definite plan, even if that plan is purely a defensive one.&quot;xxx x x x x

SECRET, OPERATIONS.From:-   G.O.C-in-C., G.H.Q., Salonika. To:-      C.I.G.S., War Office,Handed in 4 p.m. 17-1-18, Received 4,20 a,m. 18-1-18.0-.C.239.Your 50173 cipher January 15th,General Guillaumat owing to his evident desire to get the best value out of the various armies has&apos; created a favourable Impression,   *He appears to be essentially a soldier and to regard the situation from a military point cf view.    At present he is visiting all the fronts consulting with the Commanders and endeavouring to appreciate the situation as regards both its strategical and its tactical aspects.     He appears to be a firm believer in thorough organization and is willing to listen to the opinion of others, though at the same time he has very clear views of his own.    As regards defence he intends to hold our front line as being both by nature and by fortification the strongest, in case of necessity refusing his flanks so that in the event of being forced back by superior forces he may continue to hold both Salonika and Northern Greece,    His plans tp this end are I believe now under consideration.He has expressed to me in strict confidence that as-regards offensive action he considers that he has not the means for achieving any success and that at present the general military situation is not suitable; but that all plans should be prepared for ac advance when the opportune moment arrives, but that this moment must depend On the result of military action in other theatres.     In due course he proposes to select the place or places where he considers such action feasible^
SECRET.E.L.S. 1844, . PARIS.16th January, 1918cNOTE FROM COL. SPIERS FOR COLONEL FAGAIDE.* SALONIKA.Weekly report from General Guillaumat, January 15th:TRANSLATION.&quot; I am expecting M, Venizelos with General Bordeaux this week; I hope to dispel the confusion which exists in the mind of the latter as it did in that of his predecessor Braquet be-tween the three processes of the formation, the mobilization, and the concentration of an army.     I do not Yfant mobs of Greeks here but Greek troops.        Method can supply them.The principle to be observed appears to me simple: one Greek army being organised by Bordeaux at Athens, and one Greek army being used by me on the front; in relations to each other similar to those between Paris and myself, or London and General Milne, or Rome and Mombelli.     Otherwise there is anarchy and waste and perpetual misunderstanding.The only military event of importance which has taken place is the raid carried out on the night of January 7th near Lake Prespa-see by German elements which had already been identified on this front.A few clear days have allowed aircraft to carry out recon-naissanceg in the Vardar and Bossana valleys; these reconnais-sances confirm the increase of enemy organisations, especially in the Bossana valley.The arrival of a number of new German elements appears probable though their strength is not known; the enemy air forces have received up to date materiel.     Rumours are current that the enemy is using the Greek elements he has under his control witha
a via/ to creating trouble in the country; there is no^conf irmtion of this, but it is not improbable dn a country as little homogeneous^! as Macedonia. II have this week inspected the British front on the Struma,andIthe front.of the two Serbian armies; my excellent impression with regard to the British is confirmed; the Serbian troops also inspire me with confidence.     They have done a great deal of work in the mountainous part of their front; the sector of the grenadier corps of the Serbian army at Treslna is however very precariously held.The relief of the Russians continues; it was fully time it was carried out,General Berthelot informs me that a Russian soldiersf mission of a suspicious character is being sent to my front across Bulgaria from Reumania.One Russian Brigade and a few batteries still remain on the front; the troops withdrawn have given up their arms without trouble.     The relief has not involved any serious incidents, but the troops are disorganised, and many of their officers have left them; the presence of a number of these Russian officers at Corfu, and of a large number of them at Salonika has been reported to me.I have little more confidence in the officers than I have in the rank and file, and have asked for instructions on this point.They cannot be kept here since they are no longer doing their duty; no further delusions must be cherished with regard to the possibility of making use of these misguided people responsible or no.     Russian officers and soldiers keep arriving at Corfu from Prance.     It is m0B-t, desirable that the despatch of Russians from Prance to Macedonia should be stopped altogether.     The relief of the Russians has cost me four regiments.     In the circumstances, the movement to my left of Ivlombell^s Division is for the moment a military impossibility short of risking a catastrophe; it is desir-able that an attempt should be made to get the Italian Government, which in this theatre is giving far more attention to after-war conditions than to the war, to reslise this; and in any case an effort should be made to gain time&quot;,;
