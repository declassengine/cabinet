SUMMARY OF TWELFTH REPORT BY THE BOARD OF TRADE73*0f I!TORTSvAND- INDUSTRY IN RELATION&quot; TO SHIPPING.January 16th 1918.The Report is divided into five parts dealing-respectivelywith (l) events that have taken place in December (2) the position of stocks at the end of 1917 (3) the proposed reductions of im-ports in 1918 in relation to possible unemployment (4) exports in 1917 and (5) a summary of shipping losses and gains in 1917. The salient points appear to be:PART I.Ths Position in December 1917^.(l) In December total imports into the UnitecLJCingdom amounted to 2,304,000 tons - a decrease of 27$ on December 1916 and of 46$ on December 1913.   This is the lowest figure of-impovtri in any month of 1917 by a clear half million tons, and 300^000 tons below the last estimate made by Sir A* Watson and Mr. Elderton.      The percentage reductions on 1916 and 1913 are also the worst for the year with one exception in each case*     For the whole year, imports are 20$ down on 1916 and 32$ on 1913.(2) British entrances with cargo - (other than requisitioned vessels) amounted to 1,359,000 tons - 9$ less than in December 1916, which despite the low total, is a smaller decline than in the two preceding months.       British clearances (other than requisitioned vessels) were 1,068,000 tons - 22jo less than in December 1916; this is a normal decline.Foreign entrances amounted to 293,000 tons, or 59$ less than in Deoember 1916, and foreign clearances to 595,000 tons,04S% less than in December 1916.   Though these figures aro the worst in the year with one exception, the percentage reduction on 1916 is normal,(3) In December, the aggregate British losses of vessels over 500 tons gross burden amounted to 299,000 tons of which
238,000 tons were due to war risk.    This is worse than the figures for September and November, but not quite so bad as October, when total losses amounted to 309,000 tons.    Over the same period the gains from New British ships built and brought into service were 109,000 tons and from all sources 148,000 tons.   Of the gains from sources other than new building some 21,000 tons were obtained from Norway and other neutrals on^condltion of being replaced by other ships, and are therefore not additional tonnage available for service. The effective gains in November thus amount to 127,000 iions against losses of 299,000 tons.   The net reduction of avail-able tonnage was therefore 172,000 tons as against a net re-duction in October of 154,000 tons and in November of 53,000 tons.    The tonnage of Allies other than Great Britain lost through enemy action in December was 86,000 tons, and that of neutrals was 49,000, both of v&amp;ieh areiiigher than the November figures.Between October 31st and November 30th, British tonnage in the service of the Allies as a whole was reduced by 134,000 tons and that in the service of Russia by 173,000 tons. Chiefly as a result of this, in spite of the loss of shipping that occurred in November the shipping available for British trade at the end of the month was 76,000 ton3 greater than it had been at the beginning.   This increase ia tonnage available for British trade, following upon the increase of 216,000 tons recorded for October, brings the total tonnage engaged in this service on November 30th up to 6,645,000 tons, which is great-er than in any month since July.The total tonnage under construction in British yards in the week ending January 10th was 1,712,000 tons.    This is some 16,000 tons in eie^ss of that reported for the week ending December 6th 1917,
PART  II.The position of stocks at the end of 1917.Timber (a) Softwood other than pitwood.    The stock of imported and home grown timber in hand on December 1st 1917 was enough to last for 5,7 months at the estimated rate of consumption.    But to this must be added the home grown supplies which pass directly into consumption..   . Stocks and home grown supplies together should provide timber enough to last until the end of June 1918.    The provisions of the necessary three months reserve at this date depends on (i) Imports during the period Dee*-June (ii) The further progress in home production..    December imports were good, but the essential reserve for the end of June is not yet secure.(bj Pitwood.    Stocks in Scotland, England and ft. tfales are good and very little less than a year ago*    They are enough for from 20 to 3u weeks consumption.    In S. Wales they are small, as they always have been;   and there is some doubt as to whether that district can get through 1918 with the small imports at present contemplated, (c) Furniture Wood.    The import of mahogany is now almost entirely in Government hands.    Civilian stocks of imported woods are very low.Cotton,    The stock at Liverpool on Jan. 4* 1918 was not much more than half what it was a year ago.    It was sufficient for about 8 weeks at the rate of consumption during the second half of 1917.     ill stocks are also considerably reduced.    It is hoped that with the imports sanctioned by the Cabinet production may be just maintained at the present 60/* level in the American section and at the existing satisfactory level in the Egyptian section.
Wool.    Stocks are good, enough for 5-6 months.    Imports are to be reduced by about one-sixth. Military demands areso heavy that the prospect is one of rigid &amp; continuous cur--       export ctailmont of supplies for civilian consumption &amp; civilian/F)LfiX. Kemp and Jute.&apos;   Flax stocks are adequate for. the first half of 1918.    Our great dependence on Russia makes the prospect for the second half of the year uncertain and dangerous,Hemp stocks are also adequate;   but if flax runs short hemp will more and more have to take its place.    In this case, stocks and the extra supplies which may be imported are not expected to be nearly sufficient for our needs.    Jute furnishes.an extreme case of living on stocks in 1917.    For1918 it seems certain that the industry will not have moreZ .than 3 of its 1917 supply of raw material and it may have considerably less.mineral Oils,    Stocks though not large.are better than they have been and 1918 opens much more favourably than seemed likely some  months ago. :Non-mineral oils and fats.    Stocks of oil seeds are about 25$ less than they were a year ago;   stocks of vegetable oils (including the oil content of the seeds) about 30$  less; stocks of animal and fish oils more than 50$ less.    The various stocks are sufficient to last for periods varying from rather less than 4 to about 54.months, according.to the article and the method of calculation adopted.   (Changes in the use of ihe various oils make all such Calculations uncertain)iRubber,    Stocks are large, considerably larger than a year ago, and enough for about 32 weeks&apos; British consumption. But as the re ezport is about twice the British consumption this means only about 10 weeks stock for the two purposes unless re-exports are reduced.
Paper and Paper Materials.    Stocks are not exactly known, but in general are believed to be small.   Home supplies of waste are being freely used.    There is some prospect of the utilisation of straw for the production of straw-board in the course of the year.   (Straw-board is now mainly imported).   It is anticipated that the proposed reduction of imports will mainly affect newspaper and general print-ing paper, reducing the imported raw materials in these cases by about one-third.heather.    The imported and home-produced supplies of the heavier leathers and of hides in 1917 were almost what they were in 1916.    British hides provide nearly 30$ of the leather output.    Exact figures of stocks are not available but there is no reason to think that the stocks of essen-tial types of leather are dangerously low.PART III.Proposed reductions of imports in 1918 in relation to possible unemployment, (l) The estimated imports for 1918 have been put at some six million tons less than in 1917 and it is, therefore, nec-essary to enquire whether any serious unemployment is likely to result in important British industries from difficulty in obtaining raw material.
(2)   The proposed reductions of imports areloss.-Import of Ministry of Munitions 1,550,000Import of Ministry of Food. 2,500,000Paper and Pulp 150,000Timber (including pit-props) 1,000,000Wool                                      &apos; 50,000Oil and cake 200,000Iron ore (through rpdnxftim of 200,000iron &quot;&quot;ana steel imports)Miscellaneous                     ^ 100.000&quot; 5,750,000Deduct: Increase in )Import of cotton50,000IT     II     ofphosphates      200,000250,000 250,000Net Seduction: 5,500,000(3)   These cuts may involve a reduction in the demand for labour in the paper industry of perhaps Joth. In the wool using trades there will probably be some contraction in the demand.    The linoleum industry,.it is understood will get no fresh supplies of linseed oil; and the shortage of this oil will seriously affect the paint industry.    Furthermore, in the industries which use raw cotton and jute, though no cut in imported materials is proposed, it must be remembered,that in 1917 imports were largely supplemented by the using up of stocks, so that oven an increased importation in 1918 is likely to be associated with a diminution in tho total quantity of material available for use and therefore in the demand for labour.
(4)   The degree in which reduction in the demand for labour in certain industries (consequent uson a shortage of materials) will result in lengthy unemployment seems to depend mainly at present on the extent to which dis-plaoed workpeople can move rapidly to other occupations, and on the extent to which a  reshuffling of labour is practically possible.    After a point when most of the loosely attached workpeople have gone, and the most obvious substitutions have been made to release men for the army and heavy skilled war work, any further change has to overcome increasingly serious impediments.    In the cotton industry in recent months a large volume of displaced labcur has become &quot;unemployed&quot;.I?Exports in 1917.In tons the position of exports in 1917 is roughly shown in the following Table:1913	1916	1917000 tons	000 tons	000 tonsTotal Exports        93,412	51,461	46,110lixoorts other than Coal           14,809	9,225	7.387Coal Export           76,6C3	42,236	38,723He-cxports [partly estimated;    2,000	1,500	750The principal points of interest as		regards part-icular exports are (l) in 1917 58^ of the total ccal export went to France and Italy whereas before the war only 29,* went to those countries:   (2) The exports of pig-iron in 1917 wore 734,000 tons - 35/a less than in 1913 - of which all but 50,000 tens went to Allies:   (3) The oiports of cotton in 1917 were in weight 32,* below those of 1913 and lip below the 1916 level.
Y.Summary of the Shipping Losses and gains in 1917.Losses from all causes of British tonnage during the year amounted to just less than 4,000.000-gross tons, of which rather over 3.600,000 gross tons ?/ere due to enemy action.On tho credit side 1,000,000 gross tons were completed in British yards.    The total gains of tonnage from all sources amounted to about 1,650,000 tons, which gives a net loss over the year of about 2,350,000 gross tons.   This figure does not however adequately represent the true loss because (1) it takes no account of tho large incroase that has taken place in the number of vessels repairing or awaiting repair, and (2) because it includes among gains a considerable tonnage of vessels requisitioned for use in distant waters, under special agreement from Norway and other neutrals, which have to be replaced in near waters by a corresponding amount of British tonnage.When the above two factors are taken into account, it will bo found that our available   tonrags has been reduced during the year by between 2  to 3 millions gross tens,   or say from about 17,600,000 to about 14,700,000 gross tons.  This raoans a reduc-tion of about 16.5 per cent. .A full consideration of our position must also take into account the losses of Allies and Neutrals.   During 1917, the former lost about 1,250,000 end the 1sttor nearly 1,200,000 gross tons of vessels of all sizes.   Replacements are not exactly known but are unlikely to have amounted to more than a third of total losses..    This would mean a net loss of about 1,650,000 gross tons, which should be raked to, say 1,650,000 to allow for increases in tonnage dacaged and repairing.Thus the effective net loss of British and Allied and Neutral mere ant iie marines during 1917 may be put at somswhore about 4,750,000 gross Ions out of a total tonnage of perhaps 30 millions.
