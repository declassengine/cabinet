SECRET. (xnis Document is the Property ofHis Britannic fviajestyfs Government.)despatch f. 3.From Brigadier-General A. Knox, C.B., Military Attache.Subject: BOLSHEVIK REVOLT AND COMMENCEMENT OF NEGOTIATIONSFOR AN ARMISTICE.British Embassy,* Petrograd,4th December, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to send some notes on events at Petrograd in the month of November.Kerenski&apos;s failure to take decisive measures against the Bolsheviks after the fiasco of their rising on the 16th and 17th July, and his deliberate encouragement of their party by shrieking &quot; counter-revolution&quot; at Kornilovs attempt to restore order, were bound to have their disastrous result. The Bolsheviks withdrew from the Interim Parliament and called a second Council of the Sovyets to meet at Petrograd. This Council was boycotted by all the moderate elements in the country and, therefore, when it met consisted almost entirely of Bolsheviks and Left Social Revolutionaries.An armed demonstration of the garrison in favour of the Bolsheviks was openly talked of for the 7th November. The Provisional Government called up two cyclist battalions from the front and expressed its confidence in its ability to quell any rising. In fact, Kerenski and Tereschenko only feared that the rising might not come off and that they might, therefore, be deprived of the opportunity of squashing the movement once and for all.Tereschenko stated on the 18th October that he was convinced that the German operations on the islands in the Gulf of Riga were merely the commencement of a great advance on the capital. Such an advance seemed so unlikely on military grounds that many of the public were convinced that the Government exaggerated the danger in. order to have an excuse for moving to the quieter political atmosphere of Moscow.The Petrograd Sovyet, of which Trotski was President, proclaimed that it had no trust in the Government and would take upon itself the defence of the capital. It formed, on the 2nd November, a &quot; Military Revolutionary Committee,&quot; headed by the Bolshevik, Antonov, to control the District Staff. This Committee appointed its commissaries to all units and to arms factories. It interfered in all orders issued by the District Staff and rendered the position of the latter impossible.I was to have started on a tour of the Northern Front on the night of the 5th, but visited the Staff of the District at 8 p.m. to ascertain the situation. Colonel Podryelov, the Q.M.G., usually an optimist, told me that the position was very serious and that there was no one that the Staff could trust.On the following day, Tuesday, the 6th, Bagratuni, the Chief of the Staff of the^ District, told me that the Government had decided to arrest Trotski and the Military Revolutionary Committee. All automobiles were stopped in the streets and collected in the Palace Square. About 6 p.m. the District Staff opened the bridges, posting guards of cyclist and volunteer battalions. Later in the evening a meeting of representatives of the three Cossack regiments at Petrograd-the 1st, 4th and 14th Don Cossack Cavalry Regiments was held to decide on a course of action. From the first they expressed their unwillingness to support Kerenski, who had called them &quot; counter-revolutionaries &quot; and their chosen leader Kornilov a &quot; traitor.&quot; Further, they pointed out that an attempt to&apos;put down a Bolshevik rising, unsupported as they were by infantry, would result in bloodshed, and would probably fail. Later a deputation visited Kerenski, and his refusal to declare the Bolshevik organization outside the law confirmed the Cossacks in their resolution to remain neutral.On. the morning of the 7th November, Savinkov was visited by two officers.   One, * a colonel, told him that, no officers would move a finger to support Kerenski; another, a lieutenant of the District Staff, came at mid-day and told him that a group of oflicers had actually decided to arrest Kerenski.
v Kerenski had, however, decided that all was lost for the present in Petrograd, and escaped early in the morning on a car that his aide-de-camp had borrowed from some Americans,-&apos;to join the relieving.,troops that were expected from the front. ^ The Bolsheviks had removed all the magnetos from the cars in the square during the night.It was indeed evident on the morning of the 7th that the Provisional Government had little support. The cyclists had gone over in the night. There were everywhere strong guards of Bolsheviks ; trams were running, and there was perfect order.I walked down the Millionnaya in the afternoon to visit the District Staff. Near the Hermitage there was a crowd of the Preobrajenski Regiment, ready when the time came to sweep away the few poor Junkers who guarded the approaches to the Palace Square.Pofkovnikov, the Commander-in-Chief, said he was certain he would be able to &quot; turn the whole situation round in favour of the Provisional Government. ^ There were already certain indications of reaction.&quot; He was a brave, but pathetic, optimist. Poor Bagratuni made less pretence. He had not slept for three nights, neither had he shaved. He said he had never been in such a position, for he could not depend on any order being carried out. All the town, except the Palace Square, was - in the hands of the rebels. The Provisional Government was sitting, and had decided to hold out to the end. Troops were on their way from the front, but had been delayed. He thanked me for coming to see him. He was arrested 4 hours later, and is still in the Fortress. Altogether I got the same impression as I had got at the Prefecture on the first day of the big Revolution forced optimism with nothing to go on.I met a young officer friend, Ragosin, and walked with him across the Square to the&apos;Winter Palace to try to see Levitski, the Chief of Kerenski&apos;s Military - &quot;Chancery. He had gone. Several workmen were taking down the tapestries and folding them up hurriedly. As I walked back to the General Staff a fusilade broke out and the crowd bolted. . Nearly all the officers had left the Staff, as the Pavlovski Kegiment had announced that it was about to occupy the building. We sealed up the doors of our rooms and took our ciphers to the Embassy.The Minister Kishkin had been appointed Dictator by the Provisional Government with Engineer Palchinski as his assistant. When I parted from Ragosin in the afternoon he went to see Palchinski, who forced him much against his will to remain with him and appointed him Commander of the Palace Defences. Ragosin objected that he had only come to Petrograd from the Caucasus for three days on purely private affairs, but Palchinski said that he must remain as he was the A.D.C. of Polovtsev, Palchinski&apos;s friend. The Garrison consisted of about 2,000 rifles from the 1st and 2nd. Peterhof and the 1st and 2nd Oranienbaum Schools of Praporshchiks, a few volunteers and a company of the Women&apos;s Battalion, which Kerenski had criminally invited in after inspecting it on the previous day. They had no provisions and had little to eat. No arrangements had been made for the defence and no one, except perhaps the women, wanted to fight.The attack commenced shortly before 8 p.m., and a furious bombardment continued till after midnight. The cruiser Aurora, which had steamed up the river to take part in the &quot;glorious work,&quot; and the guns of the Fortress, took part.General Manikovski was acting as Minister of War at&apos; the time and he describes the position of the Ministers as terrible. They moved from one room to another till * they were finally arrested about 2.30 a.m. and were convoyed to the Fortress by a crowd of rabble shrieking for their blood. Ragosin went to report and found Verderevski, the Minister of Marine, sitting in a window smoking a pipe and spitting. Other ministers sat round a table. Tereschenko walked up and down like a caged tiger. Konovalov sat on a sofa nervously pulling up his trousers till they were finally above his knees.Only the main entrances to the Palace had been guarded, and soldiers and sailors crowded in through the numerous side doors. Some of the ensigns escaped in soldiers&apos; coats which they borrowed from the Women&apos;s Battalion ; in fact the ensigns put up no fight. The women, apparently fought better. When the Palace was finally.taken it is said that one or two of them were stripped and thrown into the river. One hundred and thirty-seven were taken to the barracks of the Pavlovski Regiment where they were searched for bombs in an unnecessary manner. The regiment retained three who were violated. The remainder were passed on to the Grenadier Regiment, where on the whole, in.spite,of terrible reports, they do not seem to have been badly treated. They were released at 9 pan. on the following day at the; direct intervention of the British Embassy. These women come from,, all classes, but mostly from the Intelligentsia.    Their real  patriotism forms the one bright spot in the general
cowardice and apathy of the people of all classes since the-Revolution. They were formed with the idea of shaming the men into fighting. As&apos;it has become evident that nothing would shame the men ; the women have been induced to. disband and have been got away to their homes in womens clothes to escape the insults of the crowd. A deputation came to the Embassy to ask that they might be taken into the British service. I explained to them that British women were not allowed to fight and that they would be jealous if their Russian sisters were, and when the women had gone out, I told the officers who accompanied them that no nation in history had ever sunk so low as to allow women to fight for it and certainly England never would.With proper preparations and some heart in the command the Palace might have held out for three days. The losses, according to most accounts, were very slight, considering the expenditure of ammunition. Of the garrison only three were wounded and some six of the attackers were killed. Several of the ensigns are said to have been murdered afterwards by the notorious Pavlovski Regiment. The Palace was thoroughly looted.On Thursday the 8th the moderate socialists formed a Committee of Public safety with headquarters in the Town Hall. We asked them for a guard for the Embassy to relieve the Junkers of the Nikolas Cavalry School who had become a danger. After a few days we were given a guard of Poles who still remain.On the night of the 7th, poor Prince Tumanov, the Assistant Minister of War, and the most honest of the soldiers who had come to the front since the revolution, was wantonly murdered by sailors. He had been arrested and taken to the Kexholmski Regiment whence sailors claimed him to take to the Main Guard. He had no sooner reached the street when one of them felled him with a blow from a rifle butt from behind and the others finished him when on the ground and threw his body into the River Moika. The Russian sailors have killed many more of Russian officers in the 8 months since the Revolution than they killed German officers in the 31- years of war.The Bolshevik Military Revolutionary Committee proceeded with its policy of-disorganizing the army by sending a telegram to all fronts ordering the &quot; revolutionary soldier to observe attentively the conduct of all senior officers of the army &quot; and calling on them to arrest at once as enemies all those who did not openly and without reserva-tion, acknowledge the new revolution.On the 9th November, the Council of Sovyets published its &quot; Decree of Peace.&quot;We had-been told by the Committee of Public Safety to expect the relieving cavalry, estimated at 5,000 on this Saturday morning. The Bolsheviks were much depressed. It was necessary to re-establish communication with the fronts and the Russian General Staff was mostly in hiding, so we had ourselves to apply to the rebels. I visited the District Staff building, which gets dirtier with each revolution, and found two unknown ensigns drinking tea and munching black bread. I asked the suisse, who is a stout supporter of law and order, how long he thought this would last, and he said he did not know, but long it could not be. That was certainly the impression one got on the Saturday morning, but when night came without the relieving force, one gave up hope. :Savinkov who escaped from Petrograd on the&apos; 9th and joined the relieving, force at Gatchina on the 10th, found that its commander, General Krasnov, had not a cavaky corps as was reported at Petrograd, but only some squadrons of the 9th and 10th Don. Cossack Cavalry Regiments, and three squadrons of Ussuri Cossacks, a composite Cossack squadron of the Guard-in all about 600 sabres with 12 guns. The 15th Ussuri Cossack Cavalry Regiment had refused to join the column.Krasnov had taken Gatchina on the 9th and on the 10th at 2 p.m. approached Tsarskoe Seio, which has a garrison of 20,000. The garrison sent delegates to ask for terms and Krasnov told them to lay down their arms. Unfortuately, however, Kerenski appeared in his motor and gave vent to his usual speech about saving the revolution, &amp;c. This resulted in the usual &quot; meeting.&quot; Some of the Bolsheviks gave up their arms and others did not. -Krasnov fired four rounds of shrapnel and all opposition disappeared. The Cossacks occupied Tsaxskoe by nightfall. &quot;        -.,The 20,000 Bolsheviks tried with some success to convince the 600 Cossacks that they had really nothing to fight about. Both parties found a common ground in their dislike and distrust of Kerenski.Sunday, the llth, the day the unfortunate Junkers made their attempt in Petrograd, Krasnov&apos;s force rested. Savinkov had an interview with Kerenski and mrplored him to refrain, if possible, from further speeches. .: . s&apos;!On the morning of the 12th, Krasnov advanced on Pulkova,but his handful of men; though they fought gravely all day, were quite unable to drive back the Bolsheviks&apos;
who outnumbered them by over 10 to 1, and were .in an entrenched position. The soldiers of the Petrograd garrison had no stomach for fighting, but the &quot; Bed Guard &quot; (armed workmen), and especially the sailors, were evidently directed by men who knew their business. Captured sailors stated that there were seven German officers in the rebel staff, and from another source it is affirmed that during the operations all - conversation on the Bolshevik telephone was in the German language.No infantry came up in support, and towards evening the Cossacks, who were running short of ammunition, and were in danger of being surrounded, retired on Gatchina.That night the Cossack officers elected Savinkov as their Commissary with a chief duty of preventing Kerenski from interfering in the work of the staff. The appointment had to be confirmed by Kerenski, and was opposed by the Commissary of the Stavka, Stankevich, on the ground that Savinkov was a &quot; counter-revolutionary.&quot;Savinkov on his part considered it to be his duty to inform Kerenski that he did not and had never agreed with his policy. He says : &quot; I told him that I had long ago made up my mind that his continuance in power meant ruin for Pthssia, that I had fought him with every lawful means, and I was ready to fight him with every unlawful means, as I considered him one of the causes of the complete destruction of Russia, and precisely of the Bolshevik rising, to meet which he had totally failed to take timely measures. I did not like to say any more as he was so depressed that I pitied him!&quot; Kerenski listened to him to the end and then confirmed his appointment as commissary.At midday on the 13th a council of war was held, and the opinion of Stankevich that negotiations should be opened with the Bolsheviks prevailed. Savinkov denounced this decision as a crime against the country, and left Gatchina that evening to try to get help from the XVIIth Corps then at Nevel. He soon found that the reason of the XVIIth&apos;s Corps failure to come up was the treachery of Cherimissov, the Commander of the Northern Front, who had issued six contradictory orders in two daj^s.Finally on the 17th orders were received from General Dukhonin that no troops were to be sent to Petrograd.. Krasnov&apos;s handful of Cossacks had before this come to terms with the Bolsheviks. Krasnov was arrested, but soon released. Kerenski escaped x dressed as a sailor and wearing spectacles. It is hoped that he has finally disappeared from public life.On Sunday, the 11th, the day that K.rasnov&apos;s relieving force rested at Tsarskoe Selo, the Committee of Public Safety organized in Petrograd the so-called revolt of the Junkers. On Saturday night they had seized the Garage, and early on Sunday morning they occupied without much opposition the Central Telephone Station and the Engineer Castle. At about 8 a.m., the Junkers of the Vladimir Military School overpowered their Bolshevik Guard. The school was retaken at 3 p.m., after bombardment by artillery, and many of the Junkers were murdered. A few officers joined in the defence of the Telephone Station, but very few. While the firing was going on I met an officer I knew walking quietly in the next street arm in arm with a lady friend. He said the fighting had nothing to do with him. By nightfall on Sunday the whole town was once more in the hands of the Bolsheviks.On Monday the 12th we had two separate warnings that the Embassy was going to be attacked and we called in four extra British officers.   The night passed quietly.There were few casualties in the open righting in Petrograd, but many murders of unarmed men. On the 12th, the manager of the National City Bank, looking out of his window at 11 a.m., saw an unarmed yunker pass a group of sailors. After he had passed one of the latter raised his rifle and shot the Junker dead. This was within 100 yards of the British Embassy. Next morning a soldier was murdered under the Embassy windows as he tried to escape on a tram from the Red Guard.Meanwhile every town in Russia was going through its small revolution. In . Moscow, on the night of the 8th, the Military Revolutionary Committee issued orders to all units to obey DtJy instructions issued or countersigned by its representatives. On Friday the men of the 56th Reserve Regiment in the Kremlin seized the Post and Telegraph Office and the Governors house. On Saturday the Junkers struck back, rushing the Kremlin. The 56th Regiment retired across the river, and it was imagined that all fighting was over. The Bolsheviks, however, finally succeeded in surrounding the Junkers in the Kremlin and the boys were forced to surrender at 5 p.m. on Thursday the 15th, because they realized that their position was hopeless and there was none in all Russia with the courage to come to rescue them. The Junkers were helped by a few volunteers and a few officers. Out of a garrison of over 100,000 men only some 15,000 Bolsheviks took part in the fighting, and these were driven by about 400 lanatics.   Many of the remainder of the garrison deserted by every train to their
villages. The civilian population of over 2 millions looked on apathetically, hoping^ many of them, that the Junkers would win but fearing to help them.Peace Negotiations.-ThQ peace proposals of Lenin&apos;s Government have not yet come to anything and they may never reach a separate peace, but they have finally disorganized the Russian army, consciously completing the work that Guchkov, Kerenski and Verkhovski were unable to stop. This is now the central fact of the situation there is no Russian army, and there will never be a Russian army till1 some outside force with machine guns makes an example of a few undisciplined units.The Bolsheviks came in because of their active peace programme. They realized the impatience of the army with winter approaching and bread in the trenches growing scarce, so they lost no time. Their Decree of Peace was published 24 hours after the fall of the Winter Palace. Eleven days later when their authority had been acknovv-ledged in all the principal towns of Prussia on the night of the 20th November they despatched a radio message to Dukhonin, the Commander-in-Chief, notifying him that all the Allied representatives in Petrograd had been warned and ordering him to propose an immediate cessation of hostilities to the commaiid of the enemies&apos; armies with the object of commencing negotiations for peace. This message was received at the Stavka at 5.5 a.m. on the 21st November. The notification to the Ambassadors was received first at the French Embassy at 5.30 p.m. on the 21st, at the British Embassy at midnight on the 21st, at the Japanese Embassy some days later. It has not yet been received at all by the Roumanian and Portuguese Legations.On the evening of the &quot;list, the Jew Bronstein (Trotski) said at a meeting of the Sovyet: &quot;We confront the Allied as well as the enemy Governments with the fact that the Russian people and the Russian army wish to bring the war to an end, that we have no Imperialistic ideas of conquest, that we throw into the waste paper basket of history all the old treaties which assigned us alien territory, that we are advocates of a real peace, and for this reason we make a formal offer to commence peace negotiations, and to conclude an armistice.All Governments feel the pressure of their peoples, and our policy will be the force which will increase this pressure. This is the sole guarantee that we will attain peace,&apos; that the peace will be an honourable one, not a peace that will ruin Russia, but one in harmony with the peoples of Western Europe.&quot;&apos;As no reply was received from the Commander-in-Chief, Ensign Krilenko, who had taken charge of the Ministry of War, with his master, Lenin, at his elbow, called him up on the telephone at 2.30 a.m. on the 22nd. Dukhonin asked whether the Govern-ment had had any reply from other Governments to its peace proposals, (2) what was to be done with the Roumanian army which formed a part of the Russian front, and (3) whether Krilenko wanted negotiations to be opened with the Germans only, or with the Turks as well. When pressed for a definite reply. Dukhonin finally said that only a Government recognized; by all Russia could: negotiate for peace. Lenin dismissed him from his post as Commander-in-Chief, and appointed Ensign Krilenko in his place.At the same time Lenin and Krilenko issued a proclamation to all regimental, divisional, corps, and army committees, calling on them to elect their own representa-tives, and to commence at once on their own negotiations for an armistice,Lenin was attacked on account of this proclamation at the next meeting of the Sovyet. It was pointed out that such instructions would lead to separate agreements on every verst of front. Lenin explained that it was necessary to work&apos; for peace from below, and Krilenko, not being present, said that he had issued the proclamation relying on the military experience of his henchman. This expression passed without remark at Smolni, where humour is completely absent. Krilenko was, before the war, what is called in Russia an &quot;everlasting student,&quot; i.e., an individual who occasionally attends lectures at the university, but never takes a degree. During the war he deserted, but, after the revolution, came to the front in the llth Army as a specialist in disorganization.On the^ afternoon of the 22nd, Colonel Muraviev, Commacder-in-Chief of the Petrograd Military District, received an application for a train to convey a unit to the front. He wrote on the application : &quot; The war is ended. An armistice is being declared on all fronts.&quot;The same day Krilenko left Petrograd for the northern front, which, being the nearest to Petrograd, had since the revolution been in every sense the worst. He left to act for him in charge of the Ministry of War, Podvoiski, a solicitor- and, as things go now, a decent fellow. Krilenko&apos;s .&quot; Order 1&quot; ends :-&quot; Soldiers and comrades of the Russian Army ! The fight for peace is now in your hands. Misery,&apos; sickness, famine, deprivation and death confront you.&quot; Comrades in the fight for peace, we must-conquer.&quot; Long live immediate peace !(5490)
&quot; Supreme Commander-in-Chief and Peopled Commissary for Military Affairs, N. Kiilenko.&quot;Dukhonin was supported by the Army Committee at Mogilev and appealed to the fronts to await a peace in complete concert with the allies. The response of the Front Committees from Roumania and the south-west were favourable, but these were the responses of the Committees and none who knew the army could imagine that they for a moment represented the ideas of the soldiery. His fight was from the first hopeless for the Russian soldier has been taught that he is master in his own house&apos; and he has for months wanted nothing but peace.Cheremissov, the Comrhander-in-Chief of the northern front had trimmed so far, but the order to go to the station to report himself to Ensign Krilenko was more than even he could stomach. He refused and was arrested. Similarly, Boldirev, the honest and capable commander of the 5th Army was arrested as soon as the Napoleon of iPeace arrived at Dvinsk. He was replaced in command of the Army by Antipov, the commander of the XlXth Corps, the same Antipov who stood out for his remarkable incompetence as Chief of Staff of the Guard Corps in the retreat of 1915. Krilenko phose the XlXth Corps, one of the best originally in the Russian Army for the disgrace of despatching delegates through its lines.   The party crossed the German trenches atv 4.10 p.m. on the 27th November. It consisted of Lieutenant Schniirr of the 9th Kiev Hussars, an adventurer of doubtful reputation, and two members of the Committee of the 5th Army, the military doctor Sagalovich and the volunteer Meren. It returned next morning with the consent in principle of the German command and the next meeting was arranged for the 2nd December.At 3 p.m. on the same day (27th) a note from M. Trotski was handed to the military representatives of the allies at Petrograd. It begins with a lie and ends with an impertinence.j 1. &quot; As all our action proves, we are endeavouring to bring about a generaland not a separate armistice.We may be driven to a separate armistice .by the allies, if they continue to close their eyes to realities.2.- We are always ready to commence negotiations with any representative of the allies to reach an armistice as soon as possible.We do not ask to be recognized first; we have been recognized by the people.We want business-like negotiations; we reserve the right to publish the minutes for general information.3. The attitude of unconditional hostility with which our efforts in the cause of peace have been met by certain allied Governments will not in the least influence our policy.The allies must reply whether or not they are willing to commence negoti-ations for an immediate armistice with the object of concluding peace on democratic lines. Are they willing to follow our initiative in this direction ? Do they wish for other measures ?   If so, for what measure ?4. In so far as the allied Governments reply with a bald refusal to recognize us or our initiative, we will continue to follow our path appealing to the people against their Governments.Should thisx policy result in the separate peace which we do not desire, the responsibility will rest with the allied Governments. &quot;No reply was made.On the 28th, Lenin and Trotski issued a proclamation &quot; to the peoples of all countries of war &quot; asking if they were content to allow their diplomats to permit such a great opportunity for attaining peace to slip. &quot; The reply to the question must be given at once and not in words but by action. The Russian Army and the Russian people cannot and will not wait any longer, &amp;c.&quot;The party for negotiating the armistice was to leave Petrograd at 2 p.m. on the 1st December. It was delayed till 8. p.m. The Government had suddenly realised that they required technical advisers, but no officers of the General Staff were willing to go, and Marushevski, the Chief of the.General Staff, sent in his resignation rather than take part in negotiations for an armistice apart from the allies. The resignation he afterwards withdrew, but the officers of the General Staff published a declaration in v the press to the effect that they were entirely out of sympathy with the project for a separate armistice.The deputation finally consisted of the Jew Yoffe, as President, with eight members, of whom the only ones known are the Bolshevik Jew Kamenev (Rosenfeldt) and the
Librarian of the Library of the Military Academy, Mstislavski. Yoffe is a man of con-ventions; Kainenev is more doubtful, but he has the best head of the party. Before an audience he is merely a demagogue. He was Lenin s chief supporter in the first months of the revolution, before the return of Trotski. Mstislavski is a Social Revolutionary of conviction. Four of the other members were respectively a workman, a peasant, a soldier and a sailor. These were chosen haphazard to give a democratic complexion to the deputation. For instance, the sailor happened, on the afternoon the deputation left Petrograd, to have taken his clothes to the wash in the neighbourhood of Smolni, the Bolshevik headquarters. While waiting he went to Smolni to see a friend. In the passage he ran into Kamenev, whom he had never seen before, and he was told that he was to join the delegation which was to start in three hours.The professional advisers consisted of two naval officers and seven colonels and lieutenant-colonels of the General Staff, and were most of them picked up en route. The chief was Admiral Altfater an admiral of 35, son-in-law of General Desino. The deputation had a great send off from the Army Committee at Dvinsk, where Kamenev enlarged on the democratic character of its composition, while the workman, the peasant, the sailor and the soldier blushed apathetically.General Dukhonin at the Stavka tried to do his duty by the allies. He received some support from the South-West and Caucasian Fronts Committees. He hesitated to move south and was finally surrounded and surrendered to a detachment of sailors who accompanied Krilenko from Petrograd. He was dragged from his carriage and murdered j 18 bayonet wounds in front and 21 behind besides 3 bullet wounds. The savages then stripped the body and mutilated it. Before the war Dukhonin, then a colonel, was in charge of the Intelligence Section in the Kiev Military District, and in that capacity travelled frequently in Austria. In one of these journeys, in which he was accompanied by his wife, he was arrested for 48 hours, and then made the acquaintance of a German officer who was then employed by the Austrian counter-espoinage. It is related that this officer, disguised as a sailor, accompanied Krilenko to the Stavka, and seeing that Dukhonin had recognised him determined to get rid of him and so excited the rabble. It is even said that a search was made for Madame Dukhonin, but she got away to Kiev.The attitude of the Russian officers was very curious during the November revolution. They considered the quarrel between Kerenski and the Bolsheviks to be no affair of theirs. On the morning after the taking of the Winter Palace, I asked Colonel Golyevski how many casualties there had been. He told me he had spent the night with General Marushevski, the Chief of the General Staff, whose flat lies opposite the palace, and they were sure that there had been very few casualties. They had sent, out men repeatedly to see how things were going, they had &quot;even gone out&quot; themselves, but none had seen even a wounded man. They had apparently sat with the same detachment as our C.I.G.S. might sit at Whitehall during a debate at Westminster on female suffrage. &quot; Since the Revolt, the majority of the officers now in Petrograd have become quite unnerved. Only three or four do any work in the General Staff; the remainder hang about the passages and gossip. The British officers have everywhere carried on as usual.General Manikovski had been appointed Minister of War on Verkhovskis resigna-tion three days before the revolt. He was taken to the Fortress with the other Ministers. The Bolsheviks then came to him and asked him to resume the direction of the supply services which had fallen into a parlous state. As he says, he had been Minister three days and for each day of office sat one day in the Fortress. He resumed control on condition that he should be given a free hand in his office and should not be worried with politics. He has a dog and a cat in his flat and the dog he calls &quot;Menskevik&quot; and the cat &quot; Bolshevik.&quot; It was solely owing to Manikovski that the officers and men in the Ministry of War were prevented from striking as in the other Ministries. General Marushevski has worked honestly to the same end. They are now both under arrest, Manikovski because he sent round a circular telegram asking officers to work quietly as none could be arrested or removed from his post without his permission, and Marushevski on the ridiculous charge that he is responsible for Dukhonins murder because he addressed him on the telephone as &quot; Commander-in-Chief&quot; after his supersession by the Bolshevik Government, and so encouraged him to persist in opposition to the &quot; will of the people.&quot;Nothing more can be expected from the officer body.   It is broken in spirit and -quite powerless^ It is cruel as well as useless to put pressure on it to support the allied point of view.A word as to my military colleagues.   General Niessel, the head of the French
Military Mission is clever, and very energetic and he has got the hang of things in a very short time. He is assisted by a. large number of officers who are well housed and well paid by their Government.. We disagree on some points. Niessel is very severe in his judgment of the Russian officer and he does not care what happens to1 Russia after the war as long as we can extract the maximum use from her during the war. He thinks, for instance, that if Russia, makes a separate peace we should set all her warring elements against one another to complete her anarchy, so as to &quot; leave nothing for the Boche.&quot; This is simply vindictive nonsense, for an anarchical Russia is far more likely to fall a victim to the Germans than one that preserves a semblance of a solid front. General Niessel works as far as I know in complete accord with his Ambassador.. .,-. General Judson, the head of the American Military Mission, has a smaller staff and fewer sources of information. The policy he proposes differs materially from that of the French, and is, I think, less wild. I agree with him that the first essential for the solution of the Russian problem is now, as it has been for the last six months, the public statement by the allies of their objects in the war. He&apos; is alarmed at the growth of anti-allied feeling which must be disastrous to our policy in the long run, for a strong pro-ally Russia is essential after the war.. . ;. Judson represented the American Army in the Russo-Japanese war and he showed me a report he wrote 12 years ago in which he stated the Russian Army would be worthless if autocracy fell. He came to Russia with Mr. Roofs Mission last june and did his best to urge the necessity of sending American troops to Russia, but he was opposed by Mr. Root and General Scott. He has telegraphed for permission should the peace negotiations break down, to go to M. Trotski with an offer of 10-12 American divisions, a strong railway mission to control all main lines, and a triumvirate of three American officials with power to order on their own what they think right from abroad. Judson is quieter and has more common sense than Niessel. He does not get on with his Ambassador, but he is the better man of the two.New declaration of the rights of the soldier. Krilenko, the so-called Commander-in-Chief, has brought forward a new Declaration on the Rights of the Soldier. This is the third one we have had since the March revolution, each one giving the pampered savages a little more rope. Krilenko&apos;s effort will be difficult for the next Minister of War to beat unless he orders the officers to black the mens boots.The present Declaration provides for the levelling up of the rights and privileges of all officers and soldiers, the abolition of rank and of all badges and titles denoting rank. In addressing an officer, the terms &quot; Citizen &quot; and &quot; Comrade &quot; only will be used.Soldiers will be subject to ordinary civil law only.Officers are to be elected, &quot; as individuals are always to be found among the soldiers who may be trusted by the masses to take command.&quot; All military schools are abolished, and officers will be prepared by short courses.All higher rates of pay and all allowances are abolished.The sphere of action of the committees is extended. The regimental committee will direct the whole life of the regiment. -j General situation. Russia is now governed by a military dictatorship of two men  Lenin and Trotski. The other members of the so called Governmeyt of the Peopled Commissaries are more or less cipher. Lenin is thought to be the figure head and Trotski the brain. Russians think that Lenin is a fanatic and Trotski a German agent. It is more probable that both are fanatics who welcome German money to further their ends.Their strength in Russia is based on the utter war weariness of the unthinking uneducated masses which made itself felt long before the revolution, and was the cause of the revolution. The peasants have never had an idea as to why they were fighting. This did not matter before, but it means everything now that they are the controlling factor. They are, however, easily led, and I am still strongly of opinion that we might have saved Russia for the war, if the allies had been able to carry into effect the policy you so repeatedly advocated. It was essential for us to win over the thinking elements in the country to our side.. If we had done this, these elements would have carried the * masses,, war weary as they are.The Russia that our statesmen and soldiers have written volumes about the unscrupulous landgrabbing power-was never really Russia, it was merely a clique that -gambled with the future of the sleeping masses. The masses are intensely pacific with no idea of nationality.The thinking elements that have publicly renounced everything that they call &quot; Imperialistic aims &quot; such as -the possession of &quot;the Dardanelles, cannot understand why
we the Allies refuse to make a; similar sacrifice. Our enemies say that our aims in the war are pure landgrabbing, and challenge us to prove that they are not. Our friends are muzzled because our Governments have refused to publish an authoritative and detailed declaration to show that we are really fighting for the permanent reduction of armaments, and to give small peoples the right to choose their own governments, and that we are fighting for nothing else. The generalities which our statesmen utter from time to time are regarded as hypocrisies.It does not matter what Government will rule Russia now, the Russian army will y do no more fighting unless foreign force can be applied. A comparatively small force would be sufficient once it was in Petrograd, but the co-operation of the Government in power would be necessary to bring a small force in. Such permission could have been obtained two months ago, and it is not impossible that events may so shape theni-selves that it might be obtained again.Russians of the upper classes continually ask for foreign intervention. Their idea 1 is that we should come in and save their estates for them. They do nothing themselves; An officer lately spoke for some time on the theme of what the allies should do. I asked him what he was doing himself. He said : &quot; I am so disgusted with it all that I never look at a paper and I play baccarat all night.&quot; Another said : &quot; I like the Bolshevik regime, for I never go to the office and never do any work.&quot; These men often say that if we do not make their men fight the Germans, the Germans will make them fight us. I doubt this. The Russians will scatter very quickly to their homes&apos;; The Germans have not been able to make the Poles fight.I have the honour to be, &amp;c,A. KNOX, Brigadier-General,Military Attache.
