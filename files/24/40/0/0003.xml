&apos;HJS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPEFTY OF HIS EF.ITA.ENir! MAJESTY&apos;S GOT^R^NX Jg..t. - 3403TAR CAB]&apos;NET.1.I accept General Wey,gand&apos;8 figures on the questionof the fatigue of the troops, but I have not been able, with the best will in the world, to get to a commom denominator,     General Weygand&apos;s calculation is based cn the total ration strength of the British and French Armies in France. 2. Every Englishman in France is naturally and quiterightly classed au. a Soldier because he draws rations and wears uniform, but every Frenchman in France is not so classed, nor every French woman, and the result is that hundreds of thousands of French men and women on the rail-ways, on the roads, in the Telegraph Offices, Post Offices, in repairing shops, and in countless occupations are doing work as civilians which the English, in France, are doing as soldiers.3&quot; If M. Clemenceau can produce even some of the200,000 workmen asked for by General Petain;    if he can produce the thousands of Algerians and Senegalese of which he told mo yesterday, if General Foch can persuade the Italians to send up ^0,000 - 100,000 of the finest workmen in the world, the original figures of 4 to 11 would still be accurate bub would be more misleading than ever. Noj I cannot find a common denominator.4* The bulk of the line held by the British runs throughbogs and morasses where the winter conditions are
indescribable, so that the co-efficient of misery in the North ismuch higher than in the South.   No one can prefer Flandersto the Champagne or the Vosges country.   Nor can a linealong the whole length of which the shelling is constantand often violent be compared to parts of the line wherethe shelling is practically nil and where nightly bombingon the menfs crowded billets is almost unknown (Switzerlandto St. Mihiel is over 220 ES.)One last comparison strikes me as worth making.If the British Army were today om the right of the lineit would stretch from Switzerland to the Argonne and fromSwitzerland to St.Mihiel it would be on a comparativelyquiet front which it would be proud and happy to occupy.\To sum up:   There are 4 main arguments along whichwe must travel in order to reach an agreement.   They are(i)    The &quot;rar Game argument of a distribution of our forces based on the supposition that our forces are all of one nationality worked out by General Wilson.(ii)   The mathematical calculation as worked out in great detail by General Cadorna.(iii)   The calculation of the total number ofBritish and French troops in Prance as worked out by General Weygahd and the differente in fatigue on the troops which such a comparison shows.(iv)   The actual distribution of the enemy forces.As regards these four arguments in para. 6 1 have the following observations to make j-(a) The results obtained by arguments (i) and (11) are practically the same and amount to an extension of the British front to the region of the River Ailette.-(b) In the first paragraphs of this paper I have given my views about the. argument based on (iii).   I am afraid I cannot arrive at... a common denominator, and although I admit the tremendous labour and the colossal sacri--fices of the French Army I am as proud of the present magnificent moral of that Army as though I was myself a Frenchman.
(*) As regards the argument at (iv):   The distribu-tion of the German Army - which is all of one nationality - is approximately the same aa ours (French and British) and therefore exactly the same argument holds good in this case also, viz; that the crown Prince of Bavaria&apos;e Army should be asked by the Grown Prince and by Duke Albrecht of Wirtemburg; to take over more line to the South,, and yet after 3 years of Siege War the German Great General Staff appear to think that their present distribution is the best they can devise.(Initialled)General, Military RepresentativeBritish Section, Supreme War Council.
