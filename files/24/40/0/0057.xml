To -The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, WAR OFFICE.Now that over two months have elapsed since the British troops arrived in this country and became associated with the Italian Army it will probably be useful for me to give a general appreciation of my views as to the standard of fighting efficiency which the Italian troops may reasonably be expected to attain under present conditions in about three months time.Since the retreat at the end of October only three of the five Italian Armies have been in the front line and of these the 1st and 4th have been and still are in the northern (mountain) sectors and the 3rd in the Eastern (Piave) one. Only the two former have been seriously engaged) the losses of the 3rd Army amounting to little more than the ordinary casualties of trench warfare.stjjs 4th        The Infantry of the 1st and 4th Armies have been j^mies.   engaged more or less continuously and their losses have been heavy,Corps, Divisions, and Brigades have been frequently changed and it may be counted that on the front occupied by the two Armies 11 Brigades have suffered very heavy casualties and been withdrawn, il others have had considerable casualties but have returned to the line, while of the Bersaglieri Regiments and Alpini Battalions a large proportionhave
have been engaged and suffered heavy losses.The severity of the.climate in the mountains has caused and will continue to cause considerable wastage, and altogether a large proportion of the Infantry of these two Armies require a period of rest, reorganization, and training before being called upon to take part in any extended opera-tions *The 3rd Army, which has suffered least, has improved generally lately and has the possibilities of making still more rapid improvement during the next two or three months.The 2nd Army is the one responsible for the retreat in October and has not been engaged since.   One or two of the Divisions have been reorganized and have returned to the front sectors and are believed to have regained confidence and morale, but experience alone can show their standard of fighting efficiency.The 5th Army is newly organized, composed for the most of new formations, and must be considered for the present an unknown quantity.If then, as seems possible, the fighting on the front for the next two or three months should be limited to minor local actions, the material and opportunity would be such that the 1st and 4th Armies should be able to recuperate and become efficient, the 3rd Army make really good progress, and the 2nd and 5th be sufficiently advanced to be gradually available as supports and reinforcements *This, however, could only be accomplished if the Higher Commanders realised the backwardness of their troops in almost every particular, and the vital importance of devoting the next two or three months to really strenuous practical training, and I am afraid that at present they do not.Dealing
Dealing first with their Staff work, the Italian Staff Officers are exceedingly easy to work with, and. try in every way to help, but their knowledge of Staff work is so theoretical that they do not understand the practical difficulties of their orders.     Paper is the ruling factor; and they agree to things and issue orders which cannot be carried out, and this has. been their chief defect in their operations.     All staffs are inclined to think that once an order is Issued it is as good as done, which is far from being the case, and Staff Officers do not go out to see that the orders are being carried out.     They are generally speaking not active and do not visit the front line enough. I think In this respect they have been much impressed by the frequent visits of British Commanders and Staffs, and that this will have a good effect.There is a lack of co-operation   between the General Staff and other branches.     The General Staff, R.A., R.E. and R.F.C. are separate branches, and so is their Intelligence;There has certainly been some noticeable improve-ment in their Staff work lately, but they are generally speaking much below the stand-&apos;rd necessary for the conduct of operations on any large scale, and they do not at present inspire subordinate commanders and troops with confidence.As regards the different arms of their combatant troops I think their Artillery is their weakest branch, and this is due principally to a lack of knowledge and energy on the part of the Artillery Higher Commanders.Individual batteries can shoot, and with proper organization and training they could be made into an effective force.     As it is their organization is defective and theirapplication
application of fire poor, while counter battery work is hardly carried out at all-.Most of their recent failures have been due to defective Artillery co-operation with their Infantry, and the latter have but little confidence in their own Artillery.It is difficult to see how any very great improve -ment can be effected rapidly and yet without this improvement no material success can be anticipated.There is no doubt but that the Austrian Artillery has made considerable improvement lately, due probably to the instruction they have received from German Artillery officers, and the Italians will find in any forthcoming operations that fr$m the Artillery point of view their task will be much more difficult than heretofore, even if no German batteries are opposed to them.The Italian Engineers are probably the finest in Europe as such, and all the actual details of the work done by Engineer units are excellent, but as a military organiza-tion they are very backward and generally speaking they illustrate of what little value good work is in war unless directed and applied by officers possessing military knowledgeWhat is lacking is the higher training of the Engineer officers.    They seem almost entirely ignorant of war conditions and consequently fail tp apply the technical knowledge which they doubtless have to any practical military value.The efficiency of the Infantry varies very much in different units.   By far the greater proportion of the rank and file is excellent material, and the spirit and morale of the majority of the battalions is good, notwith-standing
5 . &amp; 3standing the very trying and strenuous time many have experienced.     But they lack training and have not much confidence in their officers.     Few of the latter have been trained to look after their men or to befit themselves by study for the responsibilities of leadership, but many are gallant fighters and staunch under fire.     The material is there for a good fighting machine If time, opportunity, and a determination to train strenuously and continuously were forthcoming.But as in the other branches of the Army the Brigades and Battalions are very much behindhand in higher tactical training.ry, I have had no opportunity of seeing any of theCavalry.     They have not been engaged recently but they did extremely well In the operations of three months ago and I believe that they are a fairly efficient body of&apos;troops.aalons. As I have said in a former communication both theFrench and ourselves are doing our best to aid all branches of the Italian Army to raise their standard of efficiency and the Italians are gradually and increasingly availing themselves of the assistance we can offer.     But progress is naturally slow and all I think that can be expected at the end of three months under present conditions is a force of fairly good, If somewhat uneven, Infantry, capable of making a brilliant attack or a stubborn defence for a time, but incapable of anything but the simplest manoeuvres and uncertain if called upon for any sustained or prolonged effort either in attack or defence; that the Infantry will have for its support Artillery which will almost certainly be inferior in tactics and fire effect to what is opposed to it, and that the conduct of operations will be by Commanders and Staff with too little practical experience and training to be able to make up forany
any deficiencies or shortcomings on the part   of the troops.I am sending in a separate communication a statement shewing the present organization of the different Armies by Corps and Divisions and a table giving the approximate strengths of the force and number of guns.(Sd.)
