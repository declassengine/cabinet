$pfeHLY   REPORT   ON   RUSSIA.   XXXVII. (25 January, 1918)His R;1i?nmc IV!ajestyfs Government)(This Document Is the Property ofIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information.CRT?/057./hin7The Bolsheviks and the Constituent Assembly.The suppression of the Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks was quite consistent with the policy they have pursued since they came into power.    There is no longer any pretence at democracy in the sense of the rule of the majority;   the present Government is openly and unavowedly a dictatorship of the proletariat.    Those who followed closely the course of events during the later stages of Ksren8ki!s regime were almost unanimous in the opinion that some form of dictatorship was inevitable.   When Komllov!s attempt   failed all eyes wsre fixed on Kaledin as the military dictator who would restore order.   Kerenskifs regime fell in November, but with its fall there arose a new form of dictatorship which was determined to govern in the same drastic fashion as a military dictator would have governed.    Had a military dictator triumphed it is extremely doubtful whether any Constituent Assembly would have been summoned during the war, but had it been summoned and had it voted for immediate peace, the probability is that it would have been dissolved - by Cossacks instead of by Red Guards.    Whether better order could have been maintained by a military dictator in Russia1 s present state of misery is a moot point, for there would have been constant trouble both from the Sovyets in the big towns and from the peasants all over the country who would have demanded an immediate solution of the land question, a solution which a military dictator backed by the bourgeoisie could never have made,TTiat has made the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly
2.possible is the apathy of the population.   It is this same apathy that has made some form of dictatorship inevitable, and It is difficult to see how any other Government is possible until peace has been concluded and more or less normal conditions again become possible.   The Constituent Assembly fell, not because the policy of the Social Revolutionary majority differed in any vital point from that cf the Bolsheviks, but because In the struggle for power between the two parties the Bolsheviks had the force and the determination which the others lacked.The Bolsheviks, and Foreign Policy.So far it is only the internal policy of the Bolsheviks that has been referred to;   what is of still greater Interest is their foreign policy and Its effects on the different belligerent countries.    There are only three foreign politics which Russia could adopt.   The first was that of the late Provisional Government, which in the minds of the Russians is the policy of the Cadets, viz. to fight on with the Allies until final military victory. That policy was attempted last year and proved impossible, and there is no likelihood of its being revived.   The second policy is that of the Social Revolutionaries as laid down by Chernov on the opening day of the Constituent Assembly.   This Is a policy.of sheer weakness.   It really differs in no respect from that of the Bolsheviks save that it calls upon the Allies to bring about a general peace rather than setting about peace negotiations of Its own accord whether the Allies Join in or not.   The third policy is that which has been adopted by the Bolsheviks.   It is purely political and does not rely upon military force.   It owes Its strength to the fact that it comes at the end of a long war and appeals directly to the war-weary and starving masses both of
Russia and of other countries.   It defies the German Government to attack Russia because it appeals directly to the German people. It cannot compromise with Germany becaust its aims are fundamentally different from those of the German Government.   The fear of revolution in Germany and Austria-Hungary which makes the Governments of the Central Powers anxious for a speedy peace is the greatest inducement to the Bolsheviks to delay it.    So long as they remain in power in Petrograd the Germans will have to look elsewhere for those with whom they can negotiate on what they would consider reasonable terms.The Bolsheviks and the Ukrainians.The most important anti-Bolshevik element in Russia at present is the Ukrainian Rada.    The latter is now in an extraordinarily difficult position.   The Rada Government is moderate Socialist, much the same as that of Kerenski.   It relies for its support chiefly on the peasant proprietors whose one desire is to keep what they have got and to keop out the peasants of the land-hungry north.    The Ukrainian troops whom the Rada can rely upon are chiefly drawn from this class and have so far managed to keep the Bolshevik elements under.   But it is uncertain whether they can continue to do so for long, aid this uncertainty makes the Government anxious to come to terms with the Central Powers.   If this reading of the Ukrainian situation be correct the Rada now finds itself forced to choose between compromise with the Central Powers snd the progress of Bolshevism in the Ukraine, and the more menacing the latter appears the more quickly will they come to terms with the former.Bolshevism In the Ukraine is strongest in the Eastern part of the territory claimed by the Rada, viz. Kharkov, Yekaterinoslav and the Donets Basin.   These territories are as far as we know
under the control of the Bolsheviks, who are trying to extend their influence towards Poltava and Kiev.     In Kiev itself the Bolsheviks are fairly strong, being drawn from the working classes in the factories.   They have not got a majority in the Kiev Sovyot, but the same was true of the Petrograd Sovyet in the early stages of the Revolution, and the character of the Ukrainian Sovyets may easily change according to circumstances.   Economic conditions in the Ukraine are far from good, and unless the Rada can effect improvements Bolshevism is likely to spread still further.Thus from the point of view of the European situation we find that the strongest anti-German elements are the Bolsheviks, who have nothing to lose and will not hurry through a peace with Germany for the sake of safeguarding property.    The Ukrainians, on the other hand, much as they may dislike the Germans, protebly feel themselves much more directly threatened by the Bolsheviks.     It may, therefore, be argued that the spread of Bolshevism to the Ukraine would be a blow to the Central Powers and sn advantage to the West.    The course of events in Eastern Europe is&quot; making social revolution a far more important factor than national antagonisms.According to the latest reports we have received the advance of the Bolsheviks continues and the position of the Rada is becoming daily more precarious.   The Ukrainians are so much alarmed that the question of calling in the Germans was openly discussed in the Rada on January 19.     If our information be correct Vinnichenko, the President of the Ukrainian Government, admitted that this was an extreme measure made necessary by the advance of the Bolsheviks.25.1.18
