(This Document is the Property of / His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)aSECRET.Intelligence Bureau, Department of Information. PIW/025.WEEKLY   REPORT   OH   ITALY, XXV. (Jan. 85th, 1918)Italian&quot; Opinion in regard to the formulation of War-Aims.The question of War-aims raised by the speeches of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson (supplemented by those of M. Pichon and Kr. Balfour) has been the subject of much discussion in the Italian press during thai past fortnight.     The first reception of the earlier declarations was most favourable and such comments and criticisms as were made were marked hy great reserve and courtesy.   Practically the whole press welcomed the speeches - from one point of view as re-presenting a successful diplomatic counter-offensive, likely to have a useful effect in enemy countries, from another as being more ex-plicitly democratic in tone than any earlier pronouncement, from yet another as providing grounds for negotiation and bringing the hone of peace nearer.     It was perhaps the emphasis laid on this latter inter-pretation and the eager cordiality with which it was urged by the &quot;Neutralist1 organs (President Wilson&apos;s speech was blessed even by the Socialist leader, Signor Tursti, while Clerical papers found that it sea almost identical with the Papal Note) that, reacting on the Inter-vontionists, moved the latter to give freer (though still raodercte Vnd courteous) expression to what they consider the inadequate eonsidera-tion shown in the speeches for Italy&apos;s vital interestsOn the subject of Austria-Hungary Italian opinion is unanimous in holding that the formulae employed bv the Prime Minister and the President of the United States in reference to Italian aspirations are too vague and restricted, that Italy&apos;s essential, claims require clear restatement by the Italian Government with a view to their embodiment
in a sore satisfactory form in the ooilective pronouncement which it is hoped may result from the next Conference in Peris.    \7hen however it comes to defining these essential claims, a division of opinion appears.The position taken up by the journals which stand in closest touch with the foreign Office (and which we know in this case re-present faithfully the standpoint of Baron Sonnino) ia that there is no oocasion for re-opening the question of Italy&apos;s War-aims. They have onoe for all been recognised and aooepted by the Allies and the Allies do not treat their promises as &quot;Scraps of Paper&quot;. If Italy&apos;s pretensions had been of an imperialistic stamp, inoom-patible with the demooratio principles of the Alliance aooentuated by the recent oourse of events, there might have been so$e oase for modification.    But everyone knows that this is not so.    No in-fringement of democratic principle is involved in- the satisfaction.Wof the essential interests to which Italy1s claims are limited. These interests fall under three heads (i)    he completion of her National Unity;   (2)   Military Security - defensible land frontiers and command of the Adriatic;   (3)   Maintenance of the ualanoe ef power in the Eastern Mediterranean.     If other powers are to gain Italy must gain also.     If other powers renounce^ all gains, Italy is prepared to do the same.    The first two claims do not involve &quot;dismemberment&apos; of Austria-Hungary, which has never been demanded by the Italian Government.     These demands represent Italy18 vital necessities.    At the same time she has been throughout in full sympathy with ana has co-operated  cordially in the larger and more ideal aims of the Entente - indeed it was these ideal aims which most of all appealed to the Italian people.The view of the Liberal and Badical press distinguishes itself from that of the more official organs by a gfeater readiness to
to accept the idea of revision of War-aims with a view to an Ententecordiale with the Jugo-Slavs and by a more uncompromising attitudetowards Austria-Hungary.     The influential Corriere della Sera ,for instance, devotes a whole series of articles to the questionof Austria-Hungary, the gist of which is as follows;-   GreatBritain, Prance and the United States naturally hate Gernuny rctherthen Austria in the foreground of their picture.     Their material,as contrasted with their ideal interests are more closely involves.in the defeat of Germany.     The material interests of Italy and ofthe Balkan peoples on the other hand are hound up with what prac-tically amounts to the 1dismemberment1 of Austria-Hungary.     Thereflection of this distinction on the recent declaration of War-aimsthreatens to produce division among the Allies, and a revised col-lective formulation is needed, which shall make it clear that it isno mere settling of accounts between opposed powers but a new andbetter order in Europe at which the Entente aims.     flfo one who is a all familiar with the character and record of the Magyar and Germanminorities in the Dual Monarchy can believe that there is any hopeof a tolerable future for its subject nationalities so long as theyremain incorporated in tt.     Italy&apos;s true policy, dictated alike byaltruistic principle and self-interest, is to identify herself withthethe cause of all/oppressed peoples of Austria-Hungary, to put herself at the head of the whole movement.     In the case of the Poles, the Rumanians and the Czecho-Slovaks there is no difficulty in the way. But between Italy and the Jugo-Slavs there have been so far differences and antipathies which stand in the way of this union which have served all too well the interests of the Central Empires.     Of these differences there must now be an end.    A complete and cordial under-standing is essential.    An anti-Austrian pronouncement made by the subject nationalities alone might not be wholly convincing, there
Of.- 4 -ight be doubt of their capacity to use wisely the independencethey claim and to effect a durable and pacific settlement of the Balkanproblem.     The case would be quite different if Italy associated her-self with .their projected settlement.     Her guarantee would make itacceptable to the Western Allies and secure for it their powerfulbacking.     By making the sacrifices required to secure this unionItaly stands to gain morally and materially infinitely more than sheno   ^culloses.    Such a policy involres/renu*e*ation of national aspirations nor of steategic security and would be worthy of Italyfs Hazzinian traditions.The Radical Seoolo is more urgent on the subject of &quot;sacrifices1, it accuses the Government of reluctance to accept the idea of revision and represents Baron Sonnino as standing in the way of a democratic modification of ****** War-aims on the part of the Allies.     He is re-minded that &quot;it is a grave error to believe that secret treaties still have the absolute value they had in the days of the old diplomacy&quot;. The Nationalist organ on the other hand blames the Italian Government for the apparent neglect of Italian interests by the Allied Governments.The Neutralist&apos; journals, while agreeing with the rest in demanding clearer recognition of Italyrs claims, lay special stress on the value of the speeches as obviously - witness the divergences between Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson&apos;s formulations - providing ground for discussion and paving the way for a negotiated peace.     The Clerical press points out with great satisfaction that the declarations-President Wilson&apos;s especially - are in complete harmony with the Papal Note.    But it must not be supposed that this agreement Implies any intention on the part of the Vatican to depart from its striot neutrality or to put pressure on either side (Osservatore Romano) The Giolittian Stampsisays that Italy and Prance have every reason to agree with the Presidents thesis concerning Freedom of the Seas, and *
hints at internationalisation of Gibraltar. Aden and the Sues Canal.The friendly language used by President Wilson ins sneaking of the Russian Revolutionaries is little to the taste of the Italian I interventionists..    They have too much to fear from the Bolsheviks I of Italy to be able to do impartial justioe to the Bolsheviks of Russia, towards whom their attitude has been one of exaggerated hostility.In connection with the.policy of solidarity with the oppressed peoples of AustriarHungary, advocated by the Liberals, must be placed the demand -raised in the same quarter for the oreation in Italy of a Czeoho-Slovak Legion such as Has already been formed in Pranoe. In the same conneotion a league has recently .been formed in Milan oalled the&apos; Demoorazia Socials Irredenta&apos;, pile of the professed ob-Jeots of which is &quot;to establish the most cordial and intimate re-la t ions between the various nationalities oppressed by the Central Empires&quot;.* *.The general effect on the public of the various Allied declarationsand of their discussion in the rtalian press is a painful statf ! uncertainty and suspioion.    rt is vaguely felt that Italy is beingmade a scape-goat, that the Allies would limit her claims to some-\ thing hardly distinguishable from the &apos;pareoohio&apos; proposed by von j Billow  to Giolitti.    The internal situation in Italy is already so &apos; precarious that it would be well  0 eliainateas soon as possible I this new source of uneasiness which so easily lends itself to ex-; ploiting by mischief-makers.Internal Affairs.The Pood Control, Department has been re-organised and its ma-chinery simplified.    Rationing is to be in working order in all ! Communes by the end of February.Speaking in the Senate Signor Crespi, the Pood Controller, addedSomething to the assurances he had given in the Chamber - Vis. that
- 6 -Italy&apos;s grain-supply was now assured up to the end of February and that there was no ground for anxiety concerning the months which would intervene before next harvest - although certain unforseen difficulties - the coal crisis in the United States and freezing up of lu American ports - made it more imperative than ever that production should be increased and consumption reduced in Italy.Signor Nitti in a recent speech explained the ingenious scheme by which the national Insurance Institute lend3 succort to the new Loan. The Institute offers a policy of insurance which guarantees, in the event of the death of a subscriber before all the instalments have been paid, the -iayment in full of Government securities purohased on the instalment system.     itei&amp;er applications of the *&amp;asie^principle are also1 arranged for.A Committee of Enquiry has been entrusted by Royal Decree with the task of investigating and reporting on the causes of and eventual responsibility for the Military events which brought about the recent retreat of the Italian armies to the Piave oaft as to the manner in whioh the retreat wis carried out.The Commission is regarded as d strong one and is constituted as followsGeneral Oanevev (Chairman)(ocmnPanded the Army in Libyan war)Admiral Canevaro (once Foreign Minister.   Commanded the Europeanfleets during Cretan insurrection)General Ragni   (distinguished service in Libya)Sisnor Raimondo   (Deputy for San Remo.   Advocate and publicist ofrepute.
