INTELLIGENCE BTIRi.AU.WHBKLY    REPORT    OH    GERMANY. S3 January, 1918.1.      All accounts from Germany seem to point to the existence of some really serious difference in the highest quarters;   the Government is obviously embarrassed.    The delay in Hertlin^s speech is, apart from other statements, quite sufficient evidence of this,    This embarrassment is the inevitable result of the beginning of any serious peace discussions;   the German Government cannot enter into nego-tiations without facing definite problems, the solution of wbioh at once brings up the acute opposition between the two currents of opinion which have divided the nation for more than a year.    The Governmont has always tried to hedge;   this resource fails as soon as a definite answer has to be given to a definite question, propoundecT by the representative of a foreign Power in the serious disoussion of terms of peace.The difference of opinion of course has always been on the question of annexation or no annexation.    The Govern-ment cannot afford completely to alienate either party.   Last July the anti-ahnexationists soemed to be getting the upper hand, and they maintained this position during the early autumn.    Then came the&apos;Italian advance and the Russian ool-lapse;   this again swelled the sails of the vaterlandspartoi, and the Government deliberately encouraged the feeling of optimism and the belief in the possibility of complete mili-tary victory.    As soon as they did this, the desire for annexations inevitably became stronger.    The optimism was necessary in order to enablo them to carry on through the winter;   an ossential part of it was a belief in the possi-
bility of victories in the West.     The conclusion of the war was to be carried through on the triumphant note.It was probably, from the point of view of the mili-tary people, a part of this programme that they should keep the Russians in their place, as General Hoffmann, the German mili-tary delogate at Brest-Iitovsk, in fact did, remind them that thoy had been beaten in the war, and that it was not for them to diotate terms to the Germans, but to accept the terms which Germany might offer.    These terms included the idea, disguised though it might be, that the fate of the Baltic Provinces and Poland was to be determined by the Central Powers;   all Russia had to do was to reoognise that these territories and their populations had ceased to be Russian.     But Trotski was too pertinacious;   the negotiations hung firo;   they threatoned to break off;   he obviously was not inclinod td accept the terms offered him, and so we get a confused situation with arguments and counter-arguments.     In this there is nothing in the least surprising;   any peace negotiations produce something of the same kind.    But the discussions have had to be public, and thoy at once create corresponding discussion between the two Parties in the German press and in the Main Committee of the Reichstag.Now comes the news&quot;of the internal difficulties in Austria;   no one can foresee how far thoy will go, but they will certainly create a widespread uneasiness and make people ask themselves whether the final victory will be so easy to obtain.2.      The most satisfactory thing for the Germans is the progress of the discussion with the Ukraine.    Here there seems to be something definitely achieved or on the point of aohieve-ment, but even here there are rocks ahead;   the nuestion of nationality affects the Ukraine as well as Lithuania;   where is
the border of the new State to be drawn?  Will the Ukrainians not claim part of Galicia, the Lithuanians part of Poland? Under the pressure of the Austrian internal situation Czernin evidently must bring home some peace settlement at an early date from Brest-Litovsk.    The negotiations with the Ukraine offer the most favourable prospects of such a settlement, and he seems to be in a conciliatory mood as regards territorial terms.    But the governing classes in Germany and the Pan-Germans, perhaps even mere than the Army leaders, are obdurate in their demands for a victorious peace, and any marked concessions by Austria would spoil the facade of victory and would at the same time encourage the Bolsheviks and the party of &quot;peace by under-standing&quot; in Germany.    Czernin has therefore gone to Berlin to discuss the situation.3.      Although nothing like the stand made by Labour in Vienna has taken piece in Germany there are plenty of symptoms of growing unrest there too.    The authorities continue to per-mit meetings of the Fatherland Party, the annexationist organ-isation headed by Tirpitz, and to suppress tho meetings of itsadversaries.    The masses have consequently taken affairs into their own hands and have invaded the meetings oi that Party and broken them up.     In Berlin it is the organisation of War Invalids (Kriegsbeseh&amp;digten), mainly Social Democratic, thatReport, when mutilated soldiers were beaten and ejected from a meeting of the Fatherland Party, these invalids attempted to hold a meeting of their own.     It was closed by the police, but not until the participants had resolved to appeal to the MainCommittee of the Reichstag end to send their iron crosses to the-Committee as a protest against the way in which theyare being treated.     It is noteworthy that the demands of the protesters include, besides an early &quot;peace by understanding&apos;-, the speedyhas taken the lead.After the scene described in last week*s
passing of the Prussian Franchise Bill, enacting equal suffrage instead Of the present throe^olass system.    Everywhere this demand is1 being associated with the demand for a &quot;peace by under-standing&quot; and attention is being called to the fact that, under cover of exuberant patriotism, Tirpitz and the fatherland Party are really agitating for the maintenance of Prussianism.The yranchise Bill is now before the special Committee of tho Prussian Chamber, whose proceedings are semi-private. Pairly full but carefully edited reports which are supplied to the Press show that, as might have been expeotod, the majority of the speakers are opposed to the principle of an equal fran-chise.    Tho Yiee-President of tho Prussian Ministry, Dr.Fried-berg, has had to encounter the opposition of the party he formerly led, the National Liberals, and has had to tell them that:&quot;If the Bill is not passed, there will be great disappoint-mont among those classes which most eagerly desiro reform, and this disappointment may help to weaken in those classes the will-to-victory.&quot;Incidentally, the discussion of the Bill furnished instructiveevidence as to the feeling among the Polish subjects of thoPrussian Crown.     A National Liberal speaker said that thedangers of. equal suffrage for the Eastern provinces of thoKingdom were very great, especially if an independent Polandwere to be set up on their frontiers.     In that case equalsuffrage for the Prussian Chamber would have the result that inPosen, West Prussia.and Upper Silesia the German element wouldbe swamped.     Indeed this result is probable enough, and thefoar of it orplains the effect which Trotsky1s proposals produceupon the German Government.4.      The handful of &quot;intellectuals&quot; in Germany who see great dangers ahead in the continuance of the war for the object of the annexationists may not yet exercise much influence, but their arguments are beginning to be reported at groater length
in the press.    A meeting attended by some 400 of them, in-eluding Professor Fflrster and Profossor Jaffe, was held atMunich last week, when Profossor von Aster in the course ofa long address said:&quot;Our policy must now deoide whether its aim is a peace to be imposed by our strength, whioh would be accompanied by autocracy at home, or a peaoe by understanding, the comple-ment of which is democracy at home.&quot;He added:&quot;The great mass of the politically uneduaated, who,, when the news of another victory comes, dream of a peace imposed by our strength, and, when the bread ration is reduced and there is no coal, cry for a fpeace by understanding1 ..... these people must be taught that it is a oase of definitely choosing the one thing or the other.&quot;Trotsky1b tactics at Brest-litovsk and the events at Vienna mayperhaps influence and hasten tho choice6.      It is worth while drawing attention to the attitude adopted by the press, obviously under Geyernment inspiration, towards America.    An article in the Horddeutsche refers with much contempt to the prospect of American help;   &quot;we know there are American soldiers in Prance;   what are they doing?  Making roads and railways.    The Americans may talk about their greet army, but how are they going to get it to France?    They will not be able to do anything till 1919 and then it will be too late.&quot;    This seems unwise and shows the urgent necessity for preventing the Germans facing the facts of the situation.     If a great offonsive is made and if it appears that in fact even a moderate number of American soldiers are able to take effective part in holding the French lines during the spring and early summer of this year, then once again the German Government will have been convinced of deceiving its own people as it did about England, and as it did about the submarines.23. 1. 18.
