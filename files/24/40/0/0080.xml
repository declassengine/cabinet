MINISTRY OF SHIPPING.iiiil ON TONNAGE ASPECT. OF AMERICAN PURCHASES IN THIS COUNTRY.The Shipping Controller understands that tho American   *  vernment contemplate the purchase in this&apos; country of considerable aantities of stores for the American Army in Franco,  He can well derstand that there are urgent financial and other arguments in avour of this course.    The tonnage aspect of the matter seems to dm, however, to require furthor consideration.So far as tho stores in question are produced from mported materials which will have to he replaced by further jporta the Controller desires to point out that the arrangement Is uneconomical from tho point of view of tonnage in as much as ;ho raw materials take up in almost every case more shipping space ;han would be required if the articles were imported in a tanufactured state.From the particulars he has seen of orders already Uaced Sir Joseph Maclay attaches considerable importance to the point which he now raisos,and, as he understands that the American Government contemplate the placing of further orders on an extensive scale, ^he would urge that the matter should be thoroughly exploted without delay.   A reference to the Committee on ^Restriction of Imports which is now in session would perhaps afford the most convenient method of coordinating the views and interest of the various Departments concerned and of securing a general decision as to future policy.28th January 1918.
