In the meanwhile the erection of the housing sheds for the rigid airships would hamper and impair the execution Qf the far more urgent Aeroplane Programme required for the Spring

There are two alternative designs under Consideration;-
030 ei- 20 months- 23- 25      &quot;S.  IrelandTime to make sheds usable       N. IrelandDorchesterIn the case of the alternative design &quot;B&quot; in Ferro-concrete and steel, in addition to the above-quoted materials there will be required 720 standards of timber, and it will be necessary to employ 480 carpenters and 750 labourers.     In computing the dates of completion given above the contractors have assumed-that they would obtain the highest priority as regards material, labour and railway transport.Having regard to the comparatively small saving in steel, to the fact that the erection would take 4^ months longer and to the additional skilled labour required, the Admiralty were of opinion that the question of erecting the sheds in ferro-concrete should be discarded.The question of the supply of steel for the construe-tion of rigid airship sheds under this programme was considered by the Works Construction Sub-Committee who referred the case for re-consideration by the War Priorities Committee on the ground that the steel required was not available and that on the Admiralty showing the work would take two years to complete.This reference was considered by the War Priorities Committee at their 10th meeting and Mr. Churchill pressed for a re-consideration of the sanction given to the reduced Airship Programme on the ground(a) That the Admiralty had changed the arguments by which they originally obtained approval for this programme which were that airships were required for scouting purposes in connection with fighting operations with the Battle Fleet.   &apos; He claimed that the Admiralty now supported the Programme on the ground that these sheds were required for anti-sub-marine scouting purposes.(b) That steel production had, since the approval given to the programme, been heavily cut down, and
ard if this steel were-allocated for the construction of rigid airship sheds, it would he at the expense of shell and aeroplanes which had already been heavily affected by the cut in steel.(c)     That the lately appointed General Staff of the Air Ministry should givo their opinion on this question in view of the probable existence of moro powerful      j long ranging aeroplanes before the airshipisheds can   1 possibly mature.Lord Derby supported Mr. Winston Churchill and stated that if the allocation of steel involved would be at the expense of shell, ho must insist on the question being referred , again tothe War Cabinet.The admiralty Controller pointed out that Mr. Churchill was in complete error in his statement at (a) above that the Admiralty had shifted the argument on which the airship programme was approved.     In addition to emphasising tho necessity of air-ships for ocoanic reconnaissance, appendix (1) of the paper sub-mitted to the Cabinet on which the programme was approved includestho following;-&quot;The requirements that may arise in connection with &quot;oceanic reconnaissance and the escort of convoy3 should &quot;be taken into account;     Enemy submarines are being built &quot;with increasing range, gun power and sea-worthiness and &quot;undoubtedly the intention of operating fiurthor from our &quot;Western shores.     If convoys are to bo escorted lay air-&quot;craft more than 150 miles from the coast,, it will have to &quot;be by rigid airships, or non-rigids of long endurance, &quot;such as the Uorth Sea type.    A rigid airship might bo &quot;Invaluable for discovering the presence of a*&quot;raider in &quot;the Korth Atlantic, should ono of these vessels oscapo &quot;to the high seas.&quot;This argument was also adduoed by the Controller and the Fifth Sea lord in reply to the Minister of Munitions 1 recordod protest against the adoption of the Reduced Airship Programme,Sir John Hunter stated that so far as labour ard material wore concerned there was no steel available ezcopt at the expense of Shell, Aircraft Factories, Tanks and all other constructional work including very large demands for other Admiralty forks.It was finally agreed that the Works Construction Sub-Committee should draw up for submission to the War Cabinet this
statement of the case which should represent concisely theviews of all the Departments concerned and show clearly whatwas involved in the programme and that a definite statementshould &quot;be made as to the time whioh it would, in point cf fact,take to complete the sheds.As requested by the War Priorities Committee a con-sultation has taken place between Sir John Hunter and theAdmiralty, and while Sir John Hunter does not dispute theweights of steel stated ho challenges the accuracy of theforecast as to the length of time required to construct thesheds, pointing out that the time quoted assumes conditions asto priority of materials, labour and railway transport whicharo not in fact obtainable under present conditions *It appears, therefore, that there is a conflict ofopinion between Sir John Hunter and the Admiralty as to theactual time which would be taken to erect the shods, but it iato be noted that the shortest possible times are as qmoted above.South of Ireland - 15-J- months North of Ireland - 18j    n Dorchester - 20-1    11Sir John Hunter further points out that the present position Is that the demands for steel for Government Departments are 150,000 to 170^000 tons per month in excess of the available supplies, exclusive of all the requirements for the upkeep and maintenance of the ordinary trade of the country, public services etcetera.3 0- I A?
