Copy of letter from Engineering Employers Federation to the Prime Minister.

The Engineering Employers Federation,

24, Abingdon Street,

Westminster.

29th January, 1918.

Dear Sir,

From reports which have appeared in the newspapers, and from information which we are otherwise receiving, we are impressed with the fact that within the next few days the nation may be faced with a stoppage of work by the members of the A.S.E.

The gravity of such a development and the extraordinary difficulty of arriving at a satisfactory settlement of strikes at a time like the present when the minds of men are rather disturbed by so many considerations compel us to venture the liberty of expressing the hope that the Government in taking the stand they have on the question at issue between them and the A.S.E. are thoroughly satisfied that the grounds upon which they are proceeding are unanswerable and that it is not a case of putting too much value on form and too little value on substance.

Yours faithfully,

(Sgd.) ALLAN W. SMITH.

Chairman of the Management Committee.
