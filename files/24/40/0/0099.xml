DEPARTMENT Of INFORMATION^TSLLIGENCE BUBMU. //WEEKLY    REPORT    ON    GERMANYCOUNT   HERTLING1S   SPEECH.1.      It iB always difficult to know what real interpre-tation to put on speeches such as those of Count Eertling and Count Ozernin.    In dealing with these matters we want to get hack to the mind of the Government, that is. the real oonsi&amp;era tions which weigh in the Council of the Emperor with his res-ponBible military and civil advisers.    These may he quite different from the views put forward directly or indirectly in public    All the discussion in the press may be conacious-ly or unconsciously quite misleading;   the real decision may be unknown even to the inferior officials of the army and the Foreign Office, who quite possibly are conducting a surrep-titious campaign against what has already been determined on-We may be quite sure that the real grounds of any deoision would not be avowed or defended publicly;   they depend on matters whioh cannot be discussed, such as man power, food, news from Amerioa, the fear of revolution at home.    A publio Bpeeoh may be deliberately put into a form which will mislead.2.      Of one thing we may be absolutely certain, that Count Hertling, the Emperor and really every sensible person in Germany wants peace, and wants peace urgently, and the great majority would accept peace on any terms that would in any way secure what they consider essential.     They want peace primarily for the reasons that everybody else does;   they want to stop the destruction of life and property; ,they are, just as we should be in their position, profoundly affected by the great sufferings of the German people, and they want to get on
as quickly as possible to building up again and repairing the destruction made in the war.     It would be a profound error to suppose that they are not influenced by the ordinary motives which would affect any man of even ordinary intelligence and good feeling under their circumstances.     vie have every reason to suppose that Count Hertling himself is a man of great ability and genuinely actuated by high motives and real feelings of humanity.    He is a man of real culture;   his oatholicism is probably not merely political.S.      He has of course first of all to think, of the effect anything that he says will have in his own country. The position in Germany seems to be this.    The opening of negotiations with Russia had a great effect;   it aroused the long deferred hope that now at last some relief from the external pressure which was becoming almost intolerable might be looked for.     If peace could be secured with Russia, then the isolation of Germany in the world, which affects the nerves and feelings of the Germans very seriously, would be removed; there is a general belief that somehow or other peace with Russia would at no long time open the way to a general peace. It v/ould be the beginning of the dissolution of the hostile allianoe.     If peace could not be secured in any other way, the way would be open for a great military success, perhaps in Italy, more probably upon the Western front.    But we may sus-peot that even the army would be glad to be spared the awful ordeal of a new attempt to break through;   they can be certain $hat it would imply enormous losses, rnd the result must be doubtful.     .,e have evidence that the nation would scarcely stand it unless it could be carried through on a wave of con-fidence and optimism.Now, during the last fortnight, there have arisen increasing difficulties in the negotiations with Russia.
German statesmen could not shut their eyes to the possibility that the negotiations might break down.     If they did so, there would be a great reaction in Germany;   moreover there would be a strong disposition to throw the blame for the rupture upon the Government;   the discontent which seemed as if it was being pacified for the moment would break out again;   attention be concentrated on the internal struggle against the reactionary forces;   the JSolitioal opposition in the Reichstag would gain in strength;   demands for the immediate granting of the Prussian Reforms would beoome overwhelming, and the personal and political demoralisation of which we hear so much - inoipient riots and strikes * would increase.4*      They want peace because they are becoming anxious that the continuance of the war will bring about the overthrow and break down of the existing polltioal and social order. During the week before the speech was made the internal situation in Germany was very disturbed.    The animosity between the Fatherland Party and their opponents has been increasing;   it has taken the form of violent disturbances;   meetings of the Fatherland Party have been broken up amid cries of &quot;Down with Hindenburg&quot;.     In this condition of affairs came the news of the great strike in Austria;   apparently attempts were made to prevent the full knowledge spreading to Germany, but these could not be successful;   there were suppressions both of the Vorwarts and of the Berliner Tageblatt, and there must have been serious apprehension about the whole internal position.    V/hat has happened in Russia must have an effect in the neighbouring countries;   this would first be felt in Austria, but from Austria it would possibly spread to Germany.    Hobody in this country can possibly estimate, we may say with good confidence that the German Government themselves do not know and are oon-scious that they do not know, precisely what the nature and extent of the danger is.     Of one thing we may be perfectly
qp2eertain, and that is that it is one which cannot he ignored. The situation in Austria was certainly last week extremely precarious.    However strong the press censorship may be, ideas and hopes are spreading among the extreme revolutionary sections of the Social Democrats end among those who are really so extreme that they are outside the Social Democratic Party, of whioh there was little apparent proepeot six months ago. Hitherto there have been sporadio strikes and riots, isolated acts of sabotage, explosions and incendiary fires.    The direct infiuerioe of Lenin and Trotski in Germany is probably very email\   many who are entitled to speak with authority will tell us, as the Vorwftrte does, that there is no Bolshevism in in Germany.    Let us agree that this is true, but none the less the indirect influenoe must undoubtedly be great.    The aims of the German Extreme Social Democrats are no doubt different from those of Lenin, but the success of the Maximalists in Bussia will be an encouragement to the more extreme parties in Germany to attempt to gain their objects in the same way. The leaders, unknown, obscure, isolated, who are responsible for bringing about the strikes which have taken place - and though nobody knows who they are, there must have been leaders -will communicate with one another from town to town and will begin to say;   &quot;Why should we not do in our own way what Lenin has done in Russia?11    This would be the ease especially in the districts bordering on Russia and Austria, such as for Instance Silesia, where there is a large non-German element in the population, and Saxony where there is a very large and discontented industrial population.    We can only guess at what is happening, but we can be sure that something is happening. Perhaps the German Government know little more than we do, but they must be conscious that they are living on a volcano. It is possible that nothing will come of it all, but they cannot be sure of this, and they can be quite sure that if
379   1tbings went further in Austria and it became necessary to put down strikes or riots by military force, this would lead to protests in Germany which could not be ignored.5.   . The strike in Austria was caused partly by thereduction in the bread ration, but also by the bitch in thenegotiations at Brest Litovsk.    &quot;we have the following accountfrom a German source:-&quot;This strike was certainly not begun by the Socialist Democratic Party, and from the second day it became evident that they were doing their best by warnings to people and endeavours to get them quiet, to save the situation by peaceful negotiations with the Government.    But behind them was yet another party which governed the Socialists themselves.    This was a small party of Maximalists who, although at first numerically insignificant - have lately acquired powerful means of propaganda.     Ti&apos;eir leaderf Otto Bauer, was at the bottom of the strikes in Wiener USueste.    In him the Government found its chief opponent and therefore was forced into negotiation with more moder-ate socialistic elements.    Two causes contributed to the increased anger and discontent of the mob.     One was delay in the negotiations at Brest-Mtovsk and the prevailing impression which extended far beyond the working classes, that the speech of General Hoffmann had jeopardised the conclusion of peace..,.The real fight is now between the opposing elements and the Social Democratic Party.   Offi-cial leaders of that party who stand between the &amp;ovem-ment and the extreme Socialists have achieved a complete victory against the former, though only a partial one against the latter.     The Extremists gnash their teeth at what they consider defeat due to concessions made by tho Majority Socialists.&quot;Scheidemann also tells us that the name of theGerman Emperor is greeted with insult in the streets ofVienna, but there is no word against the Emperor Charles.In order to appease the discontent Count Czernin has had topledge himself in the strongest way against any imperialistor annexationist proposals.     It was under the influence ofthis movement that his speech was made.     But all this hap-pening in Vienna has had its effect in Germany.   The GermanMinotiry Socialists have had an illustration of the manner inwhich they can exercise direct influence on the peace nego-tiations.    The example will not be forgotten and the Govern-ment knows that it will not be forgotten.     They no longer
dare, even if they would wish to do so, to use any language whioh clearly indicates annexationist aims.    They are being forced against their will to the terms of the Peace Resolution of July.6.      Under these circumstances they must not only desire peace, but they must attach the greatest importance*?he German people knowing that they desire it and believing that they do everything which oan reasonably be expected of them to bring it about.It is essential therefore that they should not leave anything which seems to be a general offer for approxi-mation unanswered, and that they should not put forward difficulties in such a way that they might seem to be trying to avoid reasonable terms and identifying themselves with the extremists.    They must therefore avoid associating themselves in any way with the Annexationists.7.      But Count Hertling has not a free band;   he may be alarmed by the possibilities of disturbances;   he is much embarrassed by criticism from the other side.     In the long run the interests of the ruling classes, whether Bavarian Catholics or Prussian Junker, are closely connected.     They feel the necessity of standing together, and they believe that in a crisis such as now exists weakness is the worst crime in a Government.    They must show no sign of alarm;   they must keep up a bold face both at home and abroad;   any defeat in the war or any recognition of defeat will be fatal to them. Much as they want peace, they cannot afford even in appearance to surrender the position that Germany is victorious, and the army chiefs who believe immensely in prestige no doubt press this point of view strongly upon the Emperor.
8*     Germans desire peace, but side by side with this, is the will to victory.    The German nation believes that on the result of this war depends the whole future position of Germany, and that if they hold out even a little longer they can Becure a good German peace.    This, is the importance of Eindenburg. It matters little really what his view is about the individual points at Issue;   we do not know what it is;   quite possibly he has no definite policy;   he and KChlmann may argue about the advantages of an Eastern and a Western policy, the relative im-portance of Mesopotamia and East Africa, Biga,.and Antwerp, Briey and Loda.    Of one thing we can be quite sure, that Hindcnburg&apos; will insist that whatever the terms of peaoe are they may be such that Germany can accept them with honour, that they show no vestige of recognition of defeat, no tampering with the. in-tegrity of the Patherland, and we can be pretty sure that in this he has the support of Hertling, JCBhlroaam-and the Emperor.    The great position of fiindenburg in Germany is due to the feeling that he stands for the honour of Germany;   what gives him the position is not belief in his cleverness and diplomatic-insight, but confidenoe in his will and determination.It 1b this national patriotic? determination, which is the greai; force we have to meet;   anything which will break this down is of the greatest value to us.    This is why at this-moment Lenin and Trotski are our best friends.    Internationalism as they preach is&apos; is, from the point of view of a patriotic German, a virulent disease;   if Germany becomes infected by it, the strength of the country will be broken.    There can be no doubt that the infection has begun;   it is spreading to Austria and from Austria to Germany.    When we hear that pensioned soldiers return their iron crosses, when meetings are broken up by men who cry &quot;Down with Hindenburgi&quot;, we realise how far we have got from 1914.    In a Germany where such things happen something is
going wrong.    The plague may still be stayed, but also it may spread.    But how is It to be stopped?    By ooncessien or by resistance?   This is the great dilemma of the Government.    One thing we can be sure of - every social, political, religious belief makes them regard theasdootrines with intense repugnance. It would be not unnatural that they should use every effort to gain a speedy peace as the best means of meeting the internal danger, especially when they learn from Austria how great the danger ,/ill there be if the war continues.9.      And so we get two speeches made no doubt by arrange-ment.    Count Czernin is compelled by the situation in Austria uungary to go very far in taking advantage oi any opening which is presented to him;   Count Hertling will be much more stiH in manner;   he will wrap up all that he has to say v/ith phrases, clauses and conditions which will make it agreeable to the national parties, but there will be nothing in it which is in reality inconsistent with what Count Czernin says.10.     The Allied Press have naturally seized the point that the two speeches are a definite refusal of the terms put forward by the Allies.    The more vociferous of the papers make this a text for saying that the voioe of the German Government is that of the Pan Germans, Imperialists, Annexationists.     It may be suggested that this view rests on a radical misconception of the position as It must appear to any German, even thOBe who are most moderate and peaceful.     The peace terms as put forward now and throughout the war by the Allies are of such a kind that they could not possibly be accepted by any German Government unless the German nation was prepared to recognise that it had been defeated. This of course is the very point of our peace terms;   as the war is one against the preponderant power of Germany, no peace will secure the objects of the alliance unless it is one which clearly implies the defeat of Germany.     But Germany has not yet been
defeated, and to a Germany which is not yet defeated we propose terms, terms whioh we affect to regard as very moderate, but terms of Such a nature that they can only be secured after a definite Viotory.    For the terms stated, whether by President wilson or by Kir. Lloyd George, or even by the Labour Party, all imply a diminution of the territory of Germany, of Austria and of Turkeyj and no sorrespending diminution of territory of England or France or the United States,    We ask for at least part of Alsace-Lorraine, for Italian Austria;   we throw out vague and undefined demands about portions of Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina;  we refuse to give back Mesopotamia and Palestine under any conditions;   we refuse to make any pledge to restore the German Colonies.    $his would be all right if Germany had been defeated in Europe, but she has not been. To the German nation all this appears as a complete justification of their position that they are fighting for the integrity and defence of the Fatherland, to the German Government it appears to be based on a complete ignorance of the military situation. No German, not even a Minority Socialist, if he found himself in office, could possibly at this moment accept negotiations onsi- - -    . . 4*the only conditions on which we offer them.    In refusing these conditions he would not appear to himself to be warlike or in-pranBigeant, or imperialist, or pan^erman, or annexationist; he would appear to be speaking merely the language of normal patriotism and oommoneense.      And there is a real and genuine apprehension even about Belgium:   Xf the military organisation of the world were to continue and Belgium were to be restored entirely without&apos; guarantees, it might be genuinely felt that the strategical position of Germany in the future would be most dangerously compromised, for Belgium would almost oertainly become ah active Ally of England and France and the basis for active operations against Germany be transferred to the Eeuse. A patriotic German, however peacefully inclined himself, might ouite honestly regard this with apprehension.
-io- 38411.    Under the circumstances of course the answer both of Rertling and Gzernin must be a refusal.    The refusal might have been put in such language, and a year ago it would have been put in such language, as to mean a complete rupture of all &apos; further discussion;   the point to notice is that Czernin&apos;B answer ends up with a definite offer to oontinue negotiations, ai least with America, and Hertling&apos;s speeoh, though it is much less conciliatory in tone, contains in fact nothing inconsistent with this.And both answers in effect, contain the offer to continue the discussion on terms which are more or less clearly indicated.    The important thing to notice Is that there is no positive word in either which implfes a claim to annexation; there is nothing about the &quot;development&quot; of Germany.    Here again this Is more clearly stated by Caerain;   Rertling*s speeob still in fact does leave it open to make claims for annexations both in the East and in the West, but in no way commits him to it.12.    The criticisms of the speeoh in Germany from the Socialist and Liberal press are instructive.    They are die-satisfied;   they suggest that Hertling is too much under the influence of the Fatherland Party, but it is important to record that their oriticism does not arise from the fact that there is a refusal of the Allied off r;   no one suggests that it should be accepted.    The criticism is merely on the ground that the German position is not made sufficiently clear; there is still left an opening for the possibility of an anuexation-ist policy.The clearest statement is perhaps that in the Frankfurter Zeitung:
&quot;The inviolability of German territory is the most elemen-tary demand, and so long as this is not acoepted by the other side negotiations are hopeless.    ue .visb however that the Chancellor in his remarks about Belgium and France had still more categorically expressed his exclusion of every possibility of annexation.&quot;The Vorwarts goes perhaps rather further than the Frankfurter, in that it seems to attach no importance to Turkey and the german Colonies and Includes specifically the right of self-determination for the peoples of ilestern Europe including the right to reunite with Russia, but they too insist on France abandoning all claim to German territory.    What they want is honest peace without annexations.13.    The situation seems to be this.    In the proposals of the two sides things have now been brought to a clear issue. The Allied proposal is that;(1)   An essential first condition before which no real dis-cussion as to peace can begin, is the unconditional acceptance of the principle of the evaouation, restoration and indemnity of Belgium.(2)   In any peace negotiations the future of Alsace-Lorraineand the question of the future frontier of Italy and Aus-tria must be included in the subjects for consideration.(3)   The AllioB refuse the restoration of Mesopotamia andPalestine to Turkey and reserve the fate of the German Colonies for the Peace Conference.As against this, the Germans and Austrians put first:(l)   The principle of the complete territorial integrity of the Central Powers and their Allies, including Turkey.(2)   Included in this the restoration of the Colonies.(3)   If they are satisfied as to this they will evaouate Belgium.The reference to Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, Hongkong, the Falkland Islands, need not be taken too seriously.   It is
-ie-probably meant as a reduptio ad absurdum of tbe Allies1 claims that Germany and Austria should be asked to give up territory in deference to general principles,    They want to show that they can do the same thing.    If you ask us to give up Alsace Lorraine for the sake of the future of Europe, we are equally justified in asking you to give up parts of other countries which you hold foi the sake of the future of the world.    They have spoiled their point by exaggerating it.    Had they limited themselves to Gibraltar and Malta, they would have been on much stronger ground.14,    And now let us turn to the diplomatic jform;   there is much in it which is interesting and curiously German, Always we see the constant vice of German diplomacy, the re-fusal to meet the situation clearly, the readiness to have   \ receurse to tricks and subterfuges.    They use the obvious diplomatic trick of trying to separate the Allies and so produce the belief (which is probably quite we&amp;l founded) that they hope to get in some underhand way what they cannot get openly.    This is just what they did at Brest*litovsk,    They agreed to tbe principle of self-determination for Courland, etc., and then tried to establish the fact that the population had already expressed their wishes, when everyone knew that they had not done so.      This it is -/hioh disgusts so many Germans with their own Government, and this it is vrhich makes it necessary to be absolutely firm in dealing with them.Their obvious plan is, instead of having massed negotiations im which the Central Powers as a whole will meet the Allies as a whole, negotiations should be split up between the different nations.    As regards Russia of course they have full justification for doing this.    As Russia has violated the pact of Paris and entered on separate negotiations, and as the Allies have not taken the offer which - though in a very
informal way - was made to thorn, of talcing part in the negotia-tions within a specified limit of time, the Germane and Auetrians are niite within their rights in saying that they will now oon-tlnue them as a separate discussion, and that America and Great Britain have no claim to intervene.    It is very different when we get to the other subjects of discussion.    We first have the extraordinary suggestion put in that the conditions of the evacuation of France have to be settled with the French Govcrn-ment alone.    The object of this is clear.    &apos;.e may assume that they would follow it up by Baying that tho German troops will not withdraw from Frence until the British and American troops have been withdrawn;   by this they hope in some sort of blundering way to oreate friction between France and her Allies and be able to work thing3 round to the state of things that France and Germany would together bring pressure upon Great Britain and America to withdraw their troops, and then they hope, having isolated France, still to get a rectification of the frontier whioh will give them more iron mines.    It is clearly intended also that the conditions of peace with Italy (and also presumably with Serbia) should be left to Austria end these Btates.    Finally we get the very crude attempt to separate the United States from Great Britain.    This is ob-vious throughout both speeches.    Mr, Lloyd George1e speech is praotisfally ignored;   President Wilson^ is treated as of great importance and discussed in detail.    It is hoped that as there are no immediate points at issue between America and Austria-Hungary, negotiations may be begun between these two States and spread from them.    Then we have Count Hertling on the freedom of the seas and the future of the Colonies on lines which are quite avowedly chosen with the view of separating American and British interests.
Tbe answer to the speech seems to be that they claim to separate different questions and hope to bring it about that settlement may be reached by independent negotia-tions, for instance with Russia, of Austria with America and Italy, of Germany with Francei    This is on the approved lines of old fashioned diplomacy.    The answer must be that no single question aan be isolated, that they are all different parts of a common problem, and that every question really concerns all the different States.    The real question is the big one of Europe and of the world, and to this all these separate problems are entirely subsidiary.    It is from this point of view that we put forward our contentions about Belgium, our claims as to )Alsace-Lorraine, the Trentine, etc., and from this point of view that we leave to the Peace Conference to determine the fate of Mesopotamia and the German Colonies,     They think of Germany alone - the power and interests of Germany;   they must learn that we honestly mean something quite different, and we cannot get on till we get a nation and a government which is thinking in the same plane.30.1.18.
