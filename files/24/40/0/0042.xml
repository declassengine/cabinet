There are a number of cases in which the men are for various reasons refusing to work overtime.16I. general remarks. Labour and the Man-Power Proposals.In this report for last week the hope was expressed that the question of man-power would prove possible of treatment as an isolated issue, unaffected by compli-cations created by the 12^ per cent, advance and the food shortage. It is satis-factory to report that circumstances tend towards the realisation of that hope; The trouble on the Clyde, due largely to questions connected with wages, housing, and food, has unquestionably become less acute, and there now appears a possibility that the man-power question will be considered by the working classes as a problem apart from the economic problems of wages and food.It is desirable that the present position should be stated, and the trend of probability indicated, as far as the latter course is possible.The attitude of the A.S.E. in refusing to meet the Minister of National Service except at a special and exclusive conference has not improved their position in the estimation of other unions, and their claim that their members should be spared until all dilutees have been taken is castigated by the &quot;Labour&apos; Leader.&quot;   Mr.
2Snowden writes: &quot; I have no sympathy at all with men who are not unwilling that others should be taken into the Army, but are anxious that they themselves should be spared. If any trade union adopts the line of demanding that certain other classes of workmen shall be first taken they are making a profound mistake, and they will alienate all public sympathy from themselves by such a course/&apos; The &quot; Herald &quot; uses a similar argument, and it cannot be doubted that the action of the A.S.E. has been, from their point of view, a very serious tactical error, and has greatly strengthened the position of the Government on the man-power proposals among members of other unions, many of whom would be glad to see the A.S.E. take a fall in the struggle.A good deal has been made in the Labour press of the widespread opposition to the proposals. A careful analysis of reported resolutions, however, indicates that the opposition, though geographically widespread, is probably only acute in those centres where the A.S.E. is powerful.&apos; A report from the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Associa-tion at Barnsley has been received which is perhaps typical of the miners&apos; attitude. At a meeting of that Association strong complaints were expressed, not against the amendment of the Bill, but on the ground that the &quot;1914 comb-out &quot; was nothing like complete, and the Government was urged to take all the men who are liable under that agreement before proceeding with the new scheme in the mines.At a meeting of the Monmouth Eastern Valley District, the urgency of the measure was explained by Mr. Winstone, and it is notable that, though his speech was largely of a pacifist nature, no effort appears to have been made to condemn the Bill.Among the railwaymen there have been one or two meetings of protest, but the resolutions accepted have been directed rather to the maintenance of the existing staff as the minimum consistent with safety than to the provisions of the Bill.Resolutions hostile to the Bill have been passed at many branch meetings of the A.S.E., and notably by the Clyde District Committee of the Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades. This body commands material support on the Clyde, and its opposition cannot be looked upon as other than serious. The resolution was to the effect that the meeting intimate to the Federation and the Government that if the latter did not withdraw the new Man-Power Bill before the end of January the delegates would advise their members on the Clyde to down tools, and further that they ask the Government to call an International Conference to discuss terms of peace.On the other hand, a ballot taken by the convenors of the shop stewards has shown that opinion is very evenly divided. Many of the older men are in favour of the comb-out, and there is now talk of a fresh ballot in which only men of military age will be allowed to vote.Barrow is definitely hostile to the Man-Power Bill, and a meeting of the Joint Engineering Committee has passed a resolution demanding its withdrawal, but the chairman said, amid cheers, that if the Government could prove that the German Government was pursuing a militarist policy they would support the Bill. The meeting also called upon the Government to summon an International Peace Conference. In Sheffield the Moulders&apos; Union con-siclers that the Bill should be withdrawn until action has been taken to conscript wealth, while the A.S.E. in that centre demands that Government should postpone it until they are prepared to open negotiations for peace. On the other hand, there is said to be a general feeling against a strike in Yorkshire, in order not to hamper the Government in its efforts to obtain a just peace. A similar resolution was passed by the A.S.E. at Liverpool, but a meeting at the Cunard Works in that city refused to accept a resolution hostile to the Bill, defeating it by a considerable majority, and reports from Liverpool indicate that drastic hostile action is not expected. Manchester. has been strangely silent, no meetings on the subject being reported. It is, however, a strong A.S.E. centre, and it cannot be concluded that there will be no opposition.On the North-East Coast demonstrations have been few, and it is said that the workers have been deeply impressed by the speeches of the Prime Minister, and the shop stewards have littie following.An exception to the rule occurred at Messrs. Parsons&apos;, where the turbine makers resolved to resist the Bill unless the Government adopt the Labour Partv&apos;s war aims, permit an International Workers&apos; Conference,&apos; and agree to the con-scription of wealth.
From Bradford a report&apos; comes that the Man-Power Bill would be generally accepted without serious opposition if the men who have escaped conscription through the munitions door were also taken, and bad time-keepers in munition works were automatically taken for the army.From the above summary, sketchy though it is, it is evident that serious opposi-tion may be expected on the Clyde and in some other centres where the A.S.E. is strong, but that generally there is more reasonable atmosphere. In most parts of the country little difficulty is likely to be experienced, and even on the Clyde the loyal section is likely to rally to the Government, while everywhere the A.S.E. has weakened its power by its attitude of superiority to and aloofness from workers belonging to other unions. The best feature of the situation is that the opposition\is not based on a desire for peace at any price, but on a misunderstanding of Germany&apos;s true aims and lingering doubts as to the imperialistic aims of the Allies, though the Prime Minister&apos;s speeches have undoubtedly had a profound effect.There can be no doubt that a correct appreciation of the real intentions of Germany would combine the whole country in support of the Bill and of every measure necessary to successful prosecution of the war. Even the &quot;Herald &quot; would not dissent. German intentions are clearly understood in Austria, and it would be very much to the advantage of this country if some definite official state-ment could be extracted from the German Government, or an opportunity for such a statement afforded, which met with refusal or with silence. The need for con-tinuous propaganda on war aims and on! the policy of Germany as revealed by General von Freytag-Loringhoven and others is greater than ever. More light is also necessary on the military situation, much of the reluctance displayed being based on the argument so persistently used by the pacifists that, even with, another 450,000 men, we should be as far as ever from winning the war.II. Press Opinions.One of the principal topics of discussion in the Labour and Socialist press of the past week has been that of man-power, which is dealt with in Section I.War Aims.In regard to that subject, and also in regard to other aspects of war and peace, there is a perceptible stiffening of opinion, due partly to the recent declarations of the Prime Minister and President Wilson, and partly to the apparent triumph of the military party in Germany.The most prominent exception is the &quot; Call,&quot; the last number of which was of so violent a description as to lead to the raiding of the British Socialist Party&apos;s offices. This paper talks of &quot;soft words &quot; from &quot;the Welsh Wizard,&quot; and its obvious object is to prevent the excellent impression made by these declarations from extending further.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; recognises the great &quot;psychological effectn of thetwo speeches, and while not prepared to accept them in toto, thinks that their effect has been good.The moderate &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; and the middle-page writer in &quot; Forward,&quot; give warm support, particularly to the more detailed statement of President Wilson, which is regarded as a &quot; historic document&apos;&apos; and a &quot; turning point.&quot;Some of the more &quot;patriotic &quot; papers, such as the &quot;New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; New Age,&quot; think that the Prime Minister was not sufficiently clear, and the latter welcomes President Wilson&apos;s complementary statement.The Labour Party&apos;s Manifesto.The recent manifesto of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, the Labour Party Executive, and the Co-operators to the Russians has met with a fair reception.The &quot; Nation &quot; goes so far as to say &quot; Labour is still making policy for the country and for the world.&quot;   But the &quot; Herald,&quot; while admitting that it is skilful,
4thinks that it does not go far enough. It is obvious that the extreme wing are attempting to pull Mr. Henderson and those who are working with him over on to their side, while the opposite section would, apparently, not be loth to see him go. The &quot;British Citizen,&quot; for example, has a &quot; J&apos; accuse&quot; article, in whicjh. Mr. Henderson is accused of adopting a definitely unpatriotic, if not treasonable, attitude.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; finds that the document is very significant; &quot; it marks a great advance in the Foreign Affairs Department of Labour,&quot; and further, &quot; it is the first political manifesto in which all three branches of the organised working class have participated.&quot; The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; however, is doubtful about the authority under which it was issued.Mr. Churchill and V2\ per cent. .The unfortunate situation which arose out of the 12^ per cent, advance to time-workers has led to numerous attacks on the Ministry of Munitions in the daily and weekly press. In some cases these take the form of personal abuse of Mr. Churchill. The &quot;New Witness&quot; makes a great point of the want of co-ordination displayed in this and other matters between the Ministry of Munitions and the Shipyard Labour Department, and thinks that steps should be taken to prevent further occurrences of this kind.Profiteering.Declarations of dividends and profits which appear at this time of the year have led to a renewal of complaints of profiteering.The &quot; Herald &quot; and &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; give details of firms which have made increased profits, and suggest that the various official declarations which have been given are only intended to gull the public.Labour Candidates.The Labour press continues to be enthusiastic about the new party&apos;s prospects at the next General Election. The Independent Labour Party are making great efforts to push themselves forward, and are expected to nominate as many as fifty candidates. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; defends their action in obtaining the rejection of candidates who have supported the war. The &quot;Herald/;&apos; curiously enough, condemns this attitude, instancing particularly the case of Mr. Thome at West Ham.Food.All the papers deal with the food question, and many of them in several places and from several different points of view. There are numerous warnings that the tempers of the people in the food queues, said to be again very prevalent, are wear-ing thin. The establishment of a Consumers&apos; Council is welcomed, but it is insisted that its functions should not be restricted to proffering advice.The &quot; Herald &quot; advocates a new policy as an alternative to compulsory ration-ing, namely, the equalisation of all incomes.The &quot;New Statesman,&quot; in an excellent article entitled &quot;Short Commons,&quot; thinks that the real grievance is the fact that there is not sufficient food to enable workers to spend the larger wages which they are earning.III. District Reports.London and South-Western.Industrially the situation is quiet, though unrest among the aircraft workers at Hen don continues. In the Woolwich area it is reported that the food situation is even worse, and if the present shortage is not relieved soon a serious stoppage of work may be expected.
At the recent meeting at Plumstead Baths the following resolution was passed: &quot; That the workers in Woolwich demand that food supplies of the country be handed over at once to be distributed by the Co-operative Societies and multiple shops at cost price, thus removing the element of profit.&quot;It is believed that an agreement has been reached between all societies through the Vigilance Committees on this point, including the A.S.E., N.U.R., Transport Workers, E.T.U., the Licensed Vehicles Workers, and the Labourers&apos; Union, and it is feared that, unless there is an early alteration for the better, there will be a general stoppage.Among the many resolutions passed at this meeting was one urging the Government to approach the belligerent nations with a view to obtaining a peace on the basis of no annexations and no indemnities an indication of the important part the food question is playing in pacifist agitation.On Saturday morning the whole of the engineers employed by Messrs. Vickers at Erith (5,000 in number) stayed away from work in order to do the family shopping.Park Royal are advocating a &quot; down tools &quot; policy, and the agitation is receiv-ing very strong support from the majority of men, and there is much feeling over the food question.South-Western.On the morning of the 19th instant the whole of the engineers (about 5,000) at Messrs. Vickers left work. They stated that they were not striking, but were taking a half day off to stand in the queues and obtain food.The recent Southampton Labour Demonstration passed off more quietly than was anticipated. Indignant resolutions on the food question were passed, but the speeches were, on the whole, moderate, and no unusual incidents took place.West Midlands.Apart from the serious strike at the Austin Motor Factory (see Section IV) the situation in Birmingham is better.Coventry is again a centre of unrest. Workers are demanding the release of Mr. R. Wallhead, the prospective candidate ffor the City,, who was recently imprisoned for a speech delivered in South Wales.The majority of workers are thought not to be in favour of taking drastic action.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The food situation in this area is the chief cause of dissatisfaction among workers. A long discussion on the queue question took place at a meeting of the Leeds Labour Party, and a resolution was carried protesting against the alleged weak and vacillating policy of the Government as regards the national food supply. It is worthy of note that the men in this district declare that they are quite willing to endure hardships and manage with less food, but they will not tolerate unfair distribution.The whole of the miners in the Doncaster district are reported to have given notice that they will cease work on the 28th unless the local Food Committee inaugurate a satisfactory rationing scheme.Meetings of the Nottingham branch of the N.U.R. have passed resolutions demanding a fair distribution of food. The Communal kitchen opened recently is reported to be popular.At Peterborough also the food problem is reported to be acute.North-Western.The industrial situation in this district is much improved.The Mersey District Shjipbuilding Trades Joint Reconstruction Committee held a mass meeting on the 20th instant. The policy of the Reconstruction Committees throughout the district and the progress already made in this direction were explained to the meeting. Councillor &apos;C. Wilson, representing the Joint [1100-13] C
Standing Committee of the Workshop Committee movement, emphasised the necessity for the engineering employees of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board to organise a workshop committee. He alleged that it was for want of such an organisation that the Board was prepared to refuse to pay them the 12f per cent.The lack of travelling facilities at Liverpool was referred to in last week&apos;s report. &quot;At Birkenhead a similar situation is said to exist, more particularly as regards the tram service. It is thought that if more ample provision were made for workers an important local cause of unrest would be removed.The food situation is peculiarly acute throughout the whole of this district. There is growing discontent amongst women of the working classes owing to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient food. The question was discussed at a meeting of Liverpool shop stewards, and it was decided to stop work and hold a demonstra-tion, probably on Saturday the 26th instant, unless a very great improvement was evident.At Manchester the District Committee of the A.S.E. are said to have decided to call out their members on the 26th as a protest against the unfair distribution of food, and it is thought probable that the whole of the allied engineering trades will support this movement.The labour situation at Barrow is reported to be passing into a critical stage, the food question being the primary cause of the trouble. Workers are said to be experiencing a real difficulty in obtaining sufficient food to enable them to do their work. Landladies are on the point of giving notice to their lodgers because they cannot get the necessary commodities. A one-day strike as a protest is by no means improbable.North-Eastern.In this district the chief ground for anxiety is the attitude of the Durhamminers&apos;.For some time past there has been a shortage of work in certain parts, and this, combined with food troubles, has produced a somewhat serious situation.The Durham Miners&apos; Association recently held a meeting at which it was decided to call upon the Government to put into operation at once some scheme for the more equal distribution of foodstuffs.The minimum wage question has for some months past been giving rise to disputes, but the matter is being dealt with by the Coal Controller, who has made an offer to the men.South Wales.Industrially, the only serious trouble in South Wales is due to the strike of bricklayers.   (See Section IV.)The food situation is no better.The position throughout this area is somewhat easier, and Mr. Barnes&apos; speech at Glasgow had a distinctly good effect. Most of the men on strike have returned or are returning to work, and the industrial situation being much clearer, a better position for the political struggle is created. There is no diminution, however, in the activity displayed by the pacifists in the Clyde dstrict. The C.W.C. are reported to be disappointed at the lukewarm attitude of Labour as regards the Russian revolution. Addressing a recent meeting at Glasgow, Gallacher warned the members of the I.L.P. to be more critical of their official leaders, who had failed to come out boldly in support of the Bolsheviks. The importance of immediate counter-measures cannot be too strongly emphasised, as it is to the Clyde that the extremists in all districts look for leadership.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a stoppage of work.It is satisfactory to report this week that the serious industrial unrest on the Clyde, which was due to the 12i.per cent, and to dissatisfaction with three awards of the Committee on Production, has to a large extent subsided. As was stated in last week&apos;s report, drillers, caulkers, riveters, and other operatives at many
of the most important shipyards had ceased work, demanding the extension of the 12% per cent, advance to all pieceworkers.The Shipyard Labour Department reports that last week nearly 12,000 men were on strike. It was now stated that, after many meetings between the repre-sentatives of the men and the Ministry of Labour, work has in most cases been resumed pending a decision on the 12\ per cent, within twenty-one days from the receipt of the application.Tlie riveters have not yet returned to work, and it is understood that in their case the trouble arises out of the recent award by the Committee on Production with regard to their price list. There is, however, every indication that this trouble is about to come to an end, as the men at Harland and &quot;Wolffs are said to have decided to return to work. No new strikes are reported from the Glasgow area during the week ending the 19th January.Three hundred and fifty drillers were involved in a strike at Armstrong^ Naval Yard in the Newcastle area. The shop stewards had approached the firm for permission to attendj a mass meeting, but owing to pressure of work this had been refused. The dispute was a question of dilution of the shipwrights&apos; drillers with fitters&apos; drillers. An early resumption of work is anticipated.The Ministry of Munitions reports that much of the present unrest amongst munition workers is due to the food question. The Man-Power Bill and, to a lesser extent, the 12^ per cent, bonus are also important contributing causes.The dispute at the Austin Motor Works, Birmingham, referred to in last week&apos;s report led, on the 16th, to a strike which involved 10,000 men. For some time the men have been agitating for the conversion of a production bonus into&apos; a flat rate plus 50 per cent. One of the most prominent agitators was a man named Peacock, a war munitions volunteer, who had been transferred from Lincoln, and a notice to Peacock intimating that he would be transferred back to Lincoln on. the 16th instant led to the strike. The workers alleged that Peacock was being victimised for the part he took in the wages dispute, and that the firm refused to recognise a deputation from an unofficial shop committee. The men returned to work on the 21st instant, Peacock having been reinstated. The original subject of dispute has not yet, however, been settled.A serious dispute resulting in the stoppage of work of 1,000 operatives at Messrs. Hotchkiss, Coventry, arose over the question of the recognition of shop stewards. Work was resumed after a day and a halfs strike on the firm undertaking to recognise the shop stewards.: About 1,600 male and 240 female workers struck work at Messrs. Hookers, Ltd., Walthamstow, owing to alleged unjust dismissal of a workman and general dissatisfaction. On the promise of immediate inquiry the men decided to return to work.The strike of bricklayers in South Wales referred to in last week&apos;s report continues. It arose from dissatisfaction with an award by the Committee on Production, and it has unfortunately already resulted in the idleness of furnaces at Llanelly, Port Talbot, and Swansea.   It is feared that the trouble may spread to other districts.Four new strikes are mentioned this week by the Coal Controller.Three cases involving a stoppage of work are reported from South Wales. Serious trouble in this district is not considered probable.Only one stoppage of work is reported this week by the War Office Contracts Department.A strike has occurred among a section of metal workers at Messrs. Richard Green and Co., Ltd., Cradley Heath, owing to the non-receipt of the August and December awards of the Committee on Production to engineers, and of the 12J per cent, bonus.Strikes are in progress among the metal workers at no less than seven aircraft factories in the London district, though in no case is the, number of men affected considerable.At Aintree about 2,000 Irish labourers employed at an aircraft factory ceased work on Monday last to enforce a demand for increased wages.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.The serious dispute among the Barrow and Furness railwaymen over the district rate, which it was at one time feared would lead to a stoppage, has temporarily at any rate been settled.The Ministry of Munitions state that the Joint Engineering Trades Committee of Coventry have alleged that while skilled men are being dismissed, dilutees are left in the factories, and have informed the Employers&apos; Federation that after the 12th January no overtime would be worked.Refusals to work overtime are being used more and more as a method of protest_particularly in cases of dilution. The general situation at Coventry continues to be so strained that petty vexations are likely to be magnified into important grievances.The dispute over the demand by wood-workers engaged in aircraft factories at Hendon for an increase in wages up to 1/3J continues. The situation appears to be the most critical at the Hendon Aircraft Manufacturing Co. and Grahame White&apos;s, where the men
ohave held combined meetings. Threats of stoppages are made continuously, but it is not, clear how far the men are in earnest.The Shipyard Labour Department report 21 new cases of dispute.At the Caledon Shipbuilding and Engineering Company&apos;s yard, the iron-turners employed on urgent Government work refuse to work overtime unless paid time and half for the late work. The men&apos;s society and the firm have an arrangement whereby a full week&apos;s work of fifty-three hours must be performed before overtime begins to count. In view of the urgency of the matter the firm has agreed to pay time and half under protest, pending a decision.The Coal Controller reports two new cases of dispute this week.Settlement has not yet been arrived at in the inter-union dispute, referred to last week, at New Sharlston. Endeavours are now being made to have the matter referred by the unions concerned to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and steps are being taken to refer to this same authority the unions involved in an acute inter-union dispute in Cumberland which had threatened the stoppage of the entire coalfield im this area during the week.Two fresh cases of dispute are reported from the War Office Contracts &quot;Department.A dispute has arisen in the Hebden Bridge district owing to the contention of the United Garment Workers&apos; Union that the employers have merged a portion of the increases, payable under an award issued by the Committee on Production, in the increases in minimum rates fixed by the Clothiaig Trade Board on the 12th November. The matter was recently referred to the Committee on Production by the Department for a ruling, and a decision was given in favour of the employers. The union, however, have refused to accept the ruling, and the matter is to be reopened.The Chief Industrial Commissioners Department reports that the number of cases referred to arbitration or settled by formal conciliation conference during the week amounts to sixty-four.Among the cases referred may be mentioned the appointment of an independent chairman to preside at a meeting between the Electrical Contractors&apos; Association and the Electrical Trades Union to deal with the question of out-working allowances in England, Wales, and Ireland.The Committee on Production during the past week heard thirty-nine cases, thirty-six in London and three in Scotland. In addition, the members of the Committee sat as a special arbitration tribunal under Section 1 (e) of the Munitions of War Act, 1917, and heard two cases that had been referred to them arising out of the 12^ per cent.
