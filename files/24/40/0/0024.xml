PA G I PIS M.&apos;I circulate a further report by Mr. Basil Thomson on Pacifism. - &apos; , G. GAVE.22nd January, 1913.Pacifism has taken on a new complexion during the last fortnight, owing to the proposal to comb out young men from the protected industries.There has been a rather sudden growth of Pacifism among the aotual workers which is, so far as can be ascertained, due entirely to their desire to save their own skins.     This is espeoially evident in Glasgow where the strikers are trying to hide their real motive under an elaborate camouflage of diss;,tis-faction about the lBjjrjJ, food difficulties, victimisation, etc     Side by side with the agitation against the comb-out there is a strong bias towards a revolutionary movement, and the Russian Revolution is being quoted by speakers as a model for imitation.     The real, feeling of the agitators is well shown in the following sentence contained in a letter, addressed by George W, Tillman to a friend, which has come into my hands:-   &quot;Needless to say, I am not in love with the littleness of the oause - to save our own skins,   I should much prefer the straight ticket of a strike for a People&apos;s Peace, and intend on every oocasion to put this forward&quot;.If it were possible to apply such a test, an announcement that the comb-eut had been abandoned, would prove immediately that the strikers v;ere not really paoifists at all.     At the same time, my correspondents do not think that a strike on the question of the comb-out will beoome general, beoause its promoters are well aware of the storm of execration it would provoke, and of the very slender disguise which they are providing to cover their real motive.The Women1s Peace Crusade is very active in Glasgow,   Mrs, Helen Crawford, an able speaker, is acquiring a large following and her speeches are said to be very mischievous.     But the most active agitator for the moment is William Gallaoher, one of the men convicted in 191f&apos; and now employed at Beardmore!s. He acts as a mouthpiece for McManus, the Clyde deportee, who seems anxious net to appear too prominently in public just now.GROWTH OF THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY.The growth of the Independent Labour Party, and the increase in the circu-lation of the &quot;HERALD&quot; and &quot;LABOUR LEADER&quot; are significant.     It is to be remembered that members of the Independent Labour Party, for the most part, are genuine Pacifists, and many persons of revolutionary bias have joined them in the belief that an early peace will make it possible to carry out their revolutionary sohemes.     The more moderate hope to bring this about in a constitutional manner, by returning a Labour majority to Parliament and putting
a Labour Government into office, but with them are associated a small body of revolutionaries, who would go all lengths.     Tom Mann, for instance, recently said at Barrow that he was out for revolution, and was going to do his best to bring it about.     These men are giving a Russian Bolshevik tinge to the unrest in Glasgow.It is difficult to estimate the aotual growth of the Independent Labour Party, but   the circulation of the &quot;LABOUR LEADER&quot; is believed to be increased at the rate of 1,100 to 2,000 a week, whioh is due to the increase of member-ship, principally in Sootland.George Lansbury is pleased with the results of his advertisements in the &quot;DAILT NEWS&quot;, but he is afraid that the Controller of paper may restrict his supplies.   Tho whole of the front page of the &quot;HERALD&quot; of January 12th was oocupied by the words, &quot;A Peoplo&apos;s Peace Now or Never&quot;, in largo print, and it was displayed as a poster in the London streets; nevertheless, the ciroula-tion does not appear to be increasing in London, though it has grown very largely on the Clyde.     The leading article in the &quot;Herald&quot; of the 19th January, sails very near the wind.     It is headed, &quot;PEACE OR THE COMB-OUT?&quot;, and the writer argues that the strikers are not against the oomb-out, but against the oontinuance of the War, adding, &quot;Those who are willing for the War to go on must be willing to fight for the War&quot;.   It is fair to say, however, that the article conoludes by saying, &quot;if the Government will re-state War aims in accordance with what is thought worth fighting for by the people who have to do the fighting;   cease the persecution of the sick, and above all, abolish   the death penalty and field punishment - then if Germany still clingsto Militarism............we do not believe British Labour will put anyobstaole in the way of providing all the men that can possibly be provided&quot;.I am informed that Mr. Roden Buxton, the Hon. Bertrand Russell, Captain Bennett, and a number of members of the Women&apos;s International Peace League have joined tho Independent Labour Party.I am told that there is a decided increase in the number of private letters, which show that the writers are War-weary, and desirous of an immediate Peace.PROPAGANDA AGAINST THE WAR LOAN.There appears to be a large number of persons who are advising investors not to buy War Bonds.   This is not exclusively from Paoifist motives, but also because there is a good deal of loose tall: about the repudiation of the Nation-al Debt, on the ground that this generation has no right to burden future generations with a heavy annual interest.There is a similar movement in France, where, I am informed, posters advertising the Frenoh War Loan have been torn down.     The recent closing of the Franoo-Spanish frontier is said to be due to the dissemination of German propaganda by Spanish labourers.in France, who now number nearly 301,000, and whe are said to be agitating against subscriptions to the Frenoh War Loan.
-   .J    -CENSORSHIP OF PAMPHLETS AND LEAFLETS.The effect of the new Regulation, requiring pamphlets and leaflets to be submitted to the Press Bureau, has undoubtedly been good.   It has caused much resentment amongst the Pacifists, and the Quakers  have determined not to submit their pamphlets to the Authorities.   They appear already to have made good their challenge, by publishing several without any imprint.There is a division of opinion in the Women&apos;s International League on this subject.   As a matter of policy, Mrs. Swanwiok and her followers desire to keep within the law;   Miss Outhwaite and Hiss Ford, on the other hand, are defiant.   The latter stated that she was sending out all sorts of &quot;suitable&quot; reading to the Front.INTER-ALLIED CONFERENCE OF LABOUR.At the last Conference held in London to demand passports for Stockholm, it was decided to form an Inter-Allied Committee to prepare an agreement between the various Socialist parties.   Following on the passing of the War Aims Memorandum at the Labour Party Conference on the 20th September, letters were sent to France, Italy, and Belgium, to arrange a date for a meeting of a Committee of two delegates of each belligerent Allied country, and American and Russian groups have also been asked to join.   After the meeting of this Committee, a simultaneous demand for passports will be made, and it is thought that this would coinoide with so strong a desire for Peace, that no -great pressure would be required to obtain them.LOWER DECK SOCIETIES.I referred in a former report to alleged unrest in the Lowor Deck ratings 1   of the Fleet.   Now that Master-at-Arms Serivens and Gunnery Instruotar Vale, of H.M.S. &quot;Resolution&quot; have boon dealt with by Court Martial, the matter appears to be at an end.   I am informed that there is practically no unrest among the seamen.STRIKE ON THE CLYDE.Most of the strikers wont back this morning, and I have just received information that the only men on strike now are the Riveters.
