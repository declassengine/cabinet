The landings have not &quot;been so large as to justify the Committee in supplying the Poor Law Institutions.Boxes.    Sullies are still being sent to Cornish Pishermenfs Societles&quot;&quot;to be paid for as they receive payment far their catches. Samples have also been sent to them of baskets used at Grimsby for wet fish, which it is thought the local men can copy and make from the same material as they use for crabpots.Turnings.

Responsible officers of the Ministry of National Service have expressed approval of the suggestion of the institution of fisheries labour units within the Army, and Major Goldie of that Department accompanied by the Head of the Registration Section called to see Major Magillicuddy of the War Offioe on the subject.    This officer was by no means unfriendly to the proposal, and the matter must now be decided by official action.    The chief- difficulty in making official application for its institution lies in estimating the numbers of men at the various local centres which are to be considered necessary.The Ministry of National Service is now printing a combined form for applications for release for fishermen and fish trade which will enable all the relevant   particulars of the case to-be considered by that Department and the Board.The Ministry haa npt so far consented to consider at all any cases of release for men in Category &quot;A&quot;, and express great unwilling-ness to consider any but most exceptional cases of men in B.l.Motor Loan Committee.A great deal of repair work during the slack season in ^reparation for the spring fishing and a large number of new installations are in progress.Here and there it is learnt that some new applicant has seen the performance of a boat equipped by the Committee and desires a similar installation for himself.
