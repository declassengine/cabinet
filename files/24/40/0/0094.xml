iment is the p^ E5HL2.l- Colonel Iom . .363/0 PERA! 10 ft S.Prom:- Genera^ De Candolle, Hostoff.C.I.G.S.Repeated :Barclay, Jassy.Despatched 11.10 pm, 27.1.18, Received 7.30 am. 28.1.18.P,0, 22 January 22nd,iI have returned from Novochercask where the leaders appeared more confident though they have not yet quite abandoned their practice of concealing their quarters and movements; apparently j the precise reason for this is obscure.Recruiting is it is true at las$ well started but up to Friday night only 2,000 men had enlisted; moreover munitions are as scarce as ever, while the recent meeting of the Constitution-al Assembly may detract from the force of the League!s political argument s,Owing to (group emitted) that the Caucasus Tchechen Corps has not paid for some time past lack of cash is still the predominant obstacle.Desertion is rife and the Corps is at the point of falling to pieces.It is not clear to vfoat extent these desertions may have contributed towards the virulence of the present troubles in Daghestan.   Originally they arose out of a dispute between Tchechen tribes and Grozny Bolshevicks.   The Torek Cossacks were drawn in merely in a vain endeavour to restore order.   I understand they are no longer taking any part, and at no stage did the Kuban Cossacks interfere.   These Dagestan troubles are not so serious from all aocounts as those around  lizabetpol. People abroad cannot be expected to form any (group-omitted) of the universal chaos prevailing in Russia.   Nothing but an early re-action which is by no means in sight or an armed intervention can now prevent its soon becoming something quite unparalleled in history.   Only the inertness of the people coupled with their present aversion from fighting of all kinds still maintains a little order.   All operations of civil life would have ceased already in any other country.As far as my otfn mission is concerned Hucher has now handed me a copy of his instructions from General Berthelot purporting to be based on a France-British convention of as long a&amp;o as December 23rd,From these it should follow that I must (?) get far more assistance and I am again wiring Petrograd,    *t is a great pity we have no Consul (2 groups undecipherable) here and there is no- news of Vice-Consul Waite.   The idea has I learn been mooted of employing the Czech Corrm now in Ukrain either by moving it into this territory or by distributing it so as to occupy the railway between here and Ukrain for which latter object the Fastoff-EkaterinoSlav line ought to be selected.   It is not likely that this Czech Corps is self-contained enough for either job and if not would it not be more beneficial to move it into lioldavia?Also
Also the Poles (?) are not very popular in Ukrain and would be heartily welcomed on the other hand by Poumania,Any transfer such as indicated at the end of preceding paragraph would render it all the more necessary to try to supply Roumania with food and fuel which should as quickly as possible be moved into that country.   Everything except food from the Ukrain will have to go by sea,   We have Roumanian and French Missions here dealing with problem but there is lack of liaison between than and neither is yet in a position to take advantage of the prevailing anarchy or to pay for large shipments by cash.The old plan can succeed no longer of purchasing under credits for subsequent settlement.   Henceforth results will become increasingly uncertain even with readily available cash.Apart from the probable difficulty of getting a holding possession of food and fuel the 2 ports of shipment Novorossisk and Mariopul are Bolshevist and on account of temper of the Russian crews the chipping Jo getting more disorganised than ever.   But there ars Houmanian and other foreign vessels still run under the old agreement by the Russians.These   vessels ought to be retransferred to their original flag and manned by RoumaniansaI am telegraphing to Jassy but it must not be forgotten that the attitude of the Black Sea Fleet is very doubtful. Kornilof   on this last subject htowever is at the moment somewhat more hopeful.
