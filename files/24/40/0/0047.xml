On March 1st there will be 8 Divisions in France.(b) June 1st 14 Divisions in Prance.(c) Sept 1st 20 Divisions in France.(d) Jan 1st 1919 ** 28 Divisions in Prance.As these divisions will require at least 6 months training in France the Entente can only rely upon having the following number efficient American Divisions in 1918: 4 in July and 8 in October. There will be besides this about 4 half trained Divisions capable of holding a quiet sector.The French C, in C, bases his plan of operation on the decisive co-operation of Americans in 1919.   On Ma:/ 1st 1919 Entente will have only 16 fully trained American Divisions and 4 or 5 capable of holding quiet sectors; so that American Army cannot&apos;then under-take offensive action on a large scale.The conclusion is that American army cannot constitute factor capable of obtaining final decision in 1919 unless great efforts are made in near future:(a) to increase ? transport.(b) to make sure that training in United States and in France shall produce maximum possible effort.
