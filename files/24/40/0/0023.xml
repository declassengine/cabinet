(1)22nd January, 1918,sir,&apos;  it beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 21st January:-The leather.Throughout the country the weather last week was bad for farm work, and very little ploughing was done.    In many parts snow fell to a depth of 6 to 9 inches, a rapid thaw with heavy rain following.     It is feared that the frosts which alternated with the snow and rain in the North, may have injured some of the wheat, which had been looking particularly well.    In the South and ffest, however, many farmers believe that the rain, which was fairly warm, may have helped the wheat,LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees, Cambridgeshire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 273 acres of land near Caxton capable of producing a good wheat crop, which is now in three separate occupations, and which was formerly part of a single farm.    The buildings are dilapidated, and it is proposed to cultivate the land by means of prisoners of war, who will be accommodated in a neighbouring building.    The Jockey Club have agreed to plough up 82 acres of grass land known as the Tan Gallop, near Newmarket, Lancashire -   The Committee are arranging for the breaking up of between 100 and 120 acres of land at Trafford Park, formerly used as accommodation land for Irish cattle arriving at the
Manchester Docks, &quot;but now unused in consequence of this trade having ceased.Sussex Vifest - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of two neglected farms of about? 130 acres on the Lane Estate, near Midhurst, which they propose to cultivate themselves. Worcestershire - Reference was made in the report dated 2nd January, 1918, to an inspection made by the Technical Division of three Commons in this county.   As a result of that inspection, the Committee have now been authorised to take possession of 150 to 200 acres of Defford Common.     They have also been authorised to take possession of such portion of Kempsey Common as they find themselves from time to time able to reclaim by means of unskilled soldiers who may be awaiting employment at the neighbouring barracks.Drainage of Lar.ds - The Buckinghamshire Executive Committee have issued notices under Paragraph (h) of Regulation 2M to secure the cleansing of the River Misbourre.Determination of Tenancies - During the week 5 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 715 acres and 3 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 8 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Fruit and Vegetable Preserving.     The Section has&apos;held exhibitions at Romford and given 55 lectures and demonstrations in different parts of the country.Canning demonstrations have been given at Newmarket and in other parts of Cambridgeshire.Allotments Section.        During the past week 258 acres of land have been taken up for new allotments and will provide 10 rod
plots for nearly 4,000 allotment holders.   At Portsmouth over 1,000 new allotments have &quot;been provided,, at Newcastle-on-Tyne 420, at the mining village of Ashington 364, and at the Port of Blythe, Northumberland, 260.At the suggestion of one of the Department^ staff of Inspectors, Messrs. Ransome and Marks, of Newark-on-Trent, are providing 112 plots (8 acres) for the use of their employees. At Tenby, of a total of 900 householders, some 450 are now provided with allotments.Fruit Section.     Negotiations with the Employers&apos; Federation of Basket Makers and with the Men&apos;s Union have reached a favourable conclusion, as the result of which it is hoped that the trade will undertake on a large scale the manufacture of baskets for agriculture *Negotiations for establishing a basket making work-shop at Evesham operated by prisoners of war are approaching completion.The scheme for the training of disabled soldiers in basket making under the Ministry of Pensions, Ministry of Labour and the Food Production Department has been completed. Particulars of the scheme will be circulated by the Ministry of Pensions to local committees in London, and to fruit growing districts.     The financial arrangements for the cost of training and the capital expenditure involved in workshopsj etc., will be borne by the Ministry of Pensions.   The Food Production Department will place an organiser at the disposal of local War Pensions Committees for the purpose .of carrying out arrangements.Special Crops.   In view of the cessation of imports of Onions the Department has made all arrangements for encouraging the increased cultivation of this crop and to this end has suggested to the Ministry of Food the necessity of issuing a statement
on this yearls prices.     A provisional agreement was come to between representatives of the Departments-, but no final and official statement has yet been received from the Ministry of Food, and in the absence of such a statement it is not possible for the Department to take action.Potato  praying Section.     The responsibility for carrying out the Spraying of Potatoes Scheme 1918 has been transferred to the Supplies Division, in order that all business connected with the Departments efforts to Increase the potato crop should be placed Under one directing head.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Wintering of Hill Sheep.    The difficulty of securing wintering for hill sheep on lowland farms has been increased by the extension of tillage, and in carrying out the tillage programme for 1919 it may be necessary to consider the breaking up of a part of the grass on upland or semi^upland farms with the object ef providing a better supply of winter keep.    Arrangements are being made for an inspection of hill farms and sheep stocks in the &quot;North and Fest of England and in Wales by an experienced Scotch sheep farmer, and a member of the Department!s staffs   The inspection will take place in April, vdien lambing is in progress and the wintering sheep have returned.    A report will be prepared on the condition of the stock, and on the possibility of improvements in management. Acetylene Residues.   Experiments have been arranged at the Rothamsted Experimental Station and at Leeds to test certain points which require settling with regard to the use of spent calcium carbide on land, in connection with an offer made to the Department by a London firm, of free supplies of the material for the use of allotment holders and others.Advice to Dairy Farmers as to the Cropping of newly broken Grass land.     A memorandum on this subject has been prepared and discussed In detail by the Technical Committee, and will be issued as a leaflet.
LABOUR DIVISION. SoJ^er^abour.   The number of ploughmen who have arrived from overseas on two months&apos; agricultural furlough is 1,403, only 10 additional men having arrived during the week.     Of these ploughmen 179 are out with Government horses, and the remainder with&apos;farmers who have ploughing work to be done.     The Department have been informed by the War Office that all these men who are in Category ,!A&quot; will be required to return to Prance on the expiration of their two months&apos; furlough.     It is understood that only about 200 of the men are belOw Category &quot;A&quot; so that 1,200 of these ploughmen will be due to return within the next two or three weeks.     The difficulty cf replacing them will be very great and the position with regard to ploughmen is in no sense satisfactory.Exclusive of these men 32,404 soldiers (22,620 &quot;skilled&quot; and 9,784 unskilled) have been attached to Depots to date out of the 43,000 soldiers to be made available for the 1918 programme.     The men actually out on farms are 20,951 &quot;skilled&quot; and 6,666 unskilled.An additional 255 men have been sent out for training as tractor drivers during the week, making a total to date of 2,543 men.The services of 55 New Zealand soldiers who are skilled ploughmen were made available for agricultural work in this country during the week, and these men were immediately placed for work under the Departments Horse Scheme.Demands for additional soldier ploughmen are being made by many of the counties, and as the Department have now drawn from the Military Authorities the whole of the skilled men allotted to them by the War Cabinet decision of the 27th June last these demands cannot be met.     It is hoped to obtain a certain number of men from the Colonial Forces during the next 14 days, but the number will be totally inadequate to meet the immediate demand.   A full statement of the whole position will be included in next week&apos;s report.
Horses.   Orders for the issue of 200 additional horses have been sent out making a total of 5,230 horses to date. Prisoners of War.   The first batch of prisoner ploughmen have arrived at one of the Depots from which they are to work, and will be at work on the land in the course of a few days.The total number of prisoners engaged on agricultural work is the same as last week, namely 6,108.     In all 90 schemes for the employment of batches of prisoner ploughmen have been sent to the War Office to date, and information has been received as regards 20 of the schemes that the premises have been approved and are being got ready to receive the men. In the case of three of the-schemes the depots are expected to open during the next three or four days.Women&apos;s Branch.A meeting of the outside officers was held during the week in order to explain fully the new conditions under which the Land Army will be recruited in future.     The great urgency and importance of the 1918 programme was impressed upon the meeting, and the need for a further 12,000 whole time women land workers during the coming season was emphasised,Arrangements have now been, definitely made to hold Efficiency Tests for women all over the country which it i^ anticipated will raise the standard of work generally, and maintain the standard of instruction at Training Centres.This week a series of Women&apos;s Institute propaganda meetings are being held in Lincoln, Warwickshire, Kent and Hampshire.     It has been found that many women who are unable to move away from their own villages are able, through the Women&apos;s Institutes, to increase the production and preservation of food.
An Interesting example of the good work done in this connection cames from Criccieth where about 18 months ago the Institute undertook to supply 1,000 eggs per week for an Army contract. The output is now 5,000 a week) and the quality and size are much superior to thbse formerly sold.MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION, The following statement shows the position as regards the provision of tractors owned by the DepartmentConsigned to County Committees and TractorSchools up to and including 21st January...........1,989Consigning instructions given duringthe week............................................ * *31On offer to counties(Titans and Overtimes, about)......,.................160Consigned to Scatland................................... 127&quot;        11 Ireland.................... ,0----,..,,.,.,82 7389&quot;&quot; SUPPLIES DIVISION. Supplies Sub-Committees.   Twelve counties were visited last week and representatives of the Supplies Sub-Committees inter-viewed by officers of the Division.   The Supplies Sub-Committees appear to be working well and on the whole are not dissatisfied with the present position as regards supply. Railway Transport.   In response to representations from the Department, the Railway Executive Committeo has issued a circular to all railway companies, drawing their attention to the paramount Importance of affording speedy transit for basic slag, sulphate ef ammonia and all other fertilisers, farm seed, seed potatoes, and agricultural machinery.   The Executive Committee instructed the railway companies to regard all these require-ments as second in importance only to Government and Munitions traffic and asks that they should be given transit facilities accordingly.
So far as can be judged from complaints which are received by the Department, the position as regards railway transport is not unsatisfactory; delays are experienced from time to time, but on the whole they appear to be exceptional rather than general.Superphosphate.   frhe superphosphate makers are now being visited by the Inspectors with a view te affording them assistance in delivering stocks In hand, which were only 5% higher on January 1st than on December 1st.   Cases exist in which appreciable quantities are on order awaiting delivery, but an effort will be made to get them supplied from stock with as little delay as Dossible;   a number of the works are, however, short of labour, and loading and dispatching take very much longer than was formerly the case.Lime.     The quantity of lime delivered for agricultural purposes still continues to be relatively large, the output in December being half as much again as in the same month last year. Efforts are being made to assist makers in regard to labour, both by the supply of German prisoners, and the transfer of skilled men (such as lime burners) who are now in the Army to Agricultural Companies, where they could again be employed in the manufacture of lime.Binder Twine.     Conferences have taken place at the Ministry of Munitions with the binder twine makers in regard to the present price which the distributors say Is unremunerative.   It Is proposed to increase the figure of 115/- to 120/- per cwt. delivered t* iarmers&apos; nearest railway station, or taken from distributors&apos; store.   A difficulty has arisen owing to the Hemp Controller having given notice of an increase in the price of hemp amounting to  15 per ton, as from the 1st of February.   If this took effect, the price of binder twine would be correspondingly raised, at any rate in respect of the quantity made from hemp received after next month.      The Ministry of Munitions is in communication with the Hemp Controller on this
point with a view to an arrangement whereby hemp imported for the manufacture of twine should escape the proposed increase.   The proposed Increase in the price of binder twine from 115/- to 120/-appears unavoidable, but the Department is pressing upon the Ministry the need for such control as will ensure that the farmer is not burdened with an addition which would bring the price up to 135/-. Seed Wheat, Arrangements are being made wiereby intending purchasers of spring seed wheats included in the recent Order issued by the Ministry of Food, will be advised as to sources from which supplies may be obtained.The Wheat Commission has approached the Department with a request that they will make arrangements for the distribution of N*.l Northern Manitoba wheat required for sowing.   The Department are endeavouring to ascertain the probable extent of the demand, and will be prepared to make arrangements for distribution to farmers If it appears practicable, and necessary.Seed Oats, (1) Manx Oats. It has been found necessary to reject a large number of the consignments arriving from the Isle of Man as they are unsuitable for seed purposes and some of them are not In good condition.   Samples from the selected parcels have been distributed to Approved Agents and Storage Agents and a number of orders have been received.   One County has provisionally ordered from 3,500 to 5,000 quarters.(2)   Irish Oats. The first cargo of Irish Black Tartarian Oats was due to arrive at the beginning of this week.   Similar arrangements are being made for the handling o? these oats to those made in regard to Manx Oats.   It is hoped that samples of the Irish Oats will be distributed to Storage Agents during the coming week.   The latest advices from Ireland indicate that the Inspectors of the Department of, Agriculture and Technical Instruction have found it necessary to reject a large number of the oats, and there may be difficulty in obtaining more than 10,000 tons.
(3) Scottish Oats,, The Board are negotiating for adequate supplies to be retained in the hands of Approved Storage Agents in England.Seed Potatoesv Out of the 17,000 tons of seed potatoes ordered up to the present by local authorities and farmers, forwarding instructions have been issued for 6,793 tons and advices as to the delivery of 362 tons have been received.    The weather during the past week has, however, prevented the loading of potatoes. Wart Disease, The influence of Wart Disease on the yield of potatoes is so greats that it has been decided to transfer to the Food Production Department the duty of controlling this disease under the Destructive Insects and Pests Act, which work has hitherto formed part of the functions of the Horticultural Branch of the Board6A new Order of the Board relating to the disease is under consideration,Potato Spraying. Great interest was displayed In the question of potato spraying at a conference held on the 17th at tho County Hallj Lewes, under the auspices of the East Sussex Executive Committee. In one instance, it was stated that of 5 acres of allotments, the average loss from disease on sprayed plots was 2^%, while on a plot worked by a man who refused to spray the loss was 75%,I am,Sir, .Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hen. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agriculture.and Fisheries.
