At present in that sector six battalions have been moved, up as reinforcement.The Allies&apos; artillery has shown considerably more activity than last week,.   The enemy1s camps have been frequently bombed by Allied aviators, especially Kustendil (Bulgarian General Head* quarters).     The enemy has shown considerable activity, particularly in the form of shelling in the Cerna Loop and frequent, patrols: the latter j/ere repulsed.The 4th Russian Brigade has been relieved by the 176th Regiment.     The general commanding 156th Division whose Head-quarters are at Duster has taken over entire command of that sector.     The relieved units are making for Sorovitch and Oatrovo, The process of weeding out was to start on 2oth instant.     The Officers are taking every day less interest in their men, many of them abandoning their units and going to Salonika, the officers of higher rank seemingly are unable to prevent them from doing so,, . .      The Serbian Staff has drawn General Guillaumat&apos;s attention to the fact that it is most unadvisable that Serbian Officers be .allowed to associate with Russian Officers,     General Guillaumat observes that the evacuating of air these undesirables, via Persia or Vladivostock, is a matter for immediate study.      General Guillaumat states that he is in urgent need of the personnel he has on several occasions already asked for, adding that both his medical and administrative-services are much understaffed,
2.As regards supplies, General Guillaumat says that it should bo distinctly understood in Paris that the Near Eastern Army is suffering from hunger, and that such a condition cannot endure: he adds that the army will undoubtedly complain to the public before long, which would bo a very undesirable condition of things.General Guillaumat is at a loss to understand the reason for the above mentioned shortage of rations, and he points out that it Is a condition unknown to either the British or Italian troops, which he says are always well provided for.He further remarks that unless something is done at once to provide not only food but also means of transport, things point to a certain and unavoidable calamity: and also that it is essential that sufficient stores of all kinds be sent out without delay to enable him to have a reserve supply to fall back on in case of necessity.The Serbian Government has arrived at Salonika.     M.Venizelos reached Salonika on the morning of the 19th together with General Bordeaux.     General Guillaumat says he has had several long interviews with M, Venizelos, and that he thinks he has been able to convince him of the advisability of employing the Greek Divisions separately, and sandwiched between French or British Divisions as he thinks it tho only way by which they can be brought Into useful accountJ he does not think that there will be any sorictus d if floury %A settling the other questions at present in abeyance,     On the other hand, General Guillaumat says that General Bordeaux appears to have a highly optimistic opinion of the Greek army, and remarks that this opinion does not in any way seem to coincide, with the reliable information he has had from other, quarters.(Sd. )     E.
