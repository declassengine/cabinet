f /sfpocnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1918.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 35. Week ended 19th January, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight and off the Belgian Coast. North Sea.On January 14th, enemy destroyers bombarded Great Yarmouth about midnight. Fifty to sixty 4.1-inch shells were fired, causing damage to house property, and six persons were killed and about 20 injured.On January 13th, R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk carried out a raid on Engel dump Flanders when 684 lb. of bombs were dropped and burst amongst sheds.    One direct hit was observed area. ,   . and a large cloud of smoke seen to rise.A number of patrols and reconnaissances have been carried out by Dunkirk machines, and several indecisive engagements took place in which one enemy machine was driven down completely out of control.On January 19th, enemy positions on the Belgian Coast were bombarded at long range by Dover Force.On January 17th, the Galata and Wrama Aerodromes were bombed, and on the Mediter-18th, the bridge over the Arda River on the main Constantinople Railway was bombed ranean and is believed to have been damaged; a direct hit on Adrianople Station was also observed.On January 19th a reconnaissance of the Constantinople-Sofia Railway was carried out by two machines. Four heavy bombs were dropped on Seidler Bridge and damage was observed.Submarine &quot; H.10 &quot; has failed to return from patrol in the North Sea. Casualties.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week from 14 to 17 large enemy submarines have been located, of.which Submarines about 6 have been operating in Home Waters and the Bay of Biscay. Four vessels of the operating, converted Deutschland type have been at sea, 2 in the vicinity of the Canary Islands, and 2 on the voyage out. There has been comparatively little activity during the week, except in the Channel between the Isle of Wight and Cherbourg, though several small submarines have been at work in the North Sea. Only two actions with submarines have been reported during the period under review.

The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of losses of losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant Steam- ^nfa?\-ships of over 500 tons gross register ;  and the table in Appendix II shows by trades as n trades regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks. vThe percentage of losses to sailings this week, as regards British tonnage employed in Overseas trades is .39 as compared with .40; last week. The losses during the week in Coasting and Cross-Channel traffic are the lowest &quot;on record, only one ship having been sunk, and the percentage of losses to sailings, as regards all United Kingdom traffic, is also the lowest yet recorded, namely, .19 as against .29 last week and .32 in the week ended November 10th.During the week, however, three British vessels, representing 11,633 tons, have been lost in non-United Kingdom trades. ; These losses are necessarily excluded from the percentage calculations owing to the absence of information as regards the total tonnage erigaged in those trades which runs any risk of enemy attack.vessels lost.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels Areas in sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the w5$. last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas.It will be seen that for the first time for many weeks the Channel and Irish Sea have not been the areas of greatest submarine activity, and that one-half of the losses this week have occurred in the Mediterranean.ENEMY MINES.Considerable minelaying activity on the part of the enemy has been experienced Minelaying. during the week, minefields having been laid in the vicinity of the Eoyal Sovereign Light Vessel, off the Dutch Coast, and in the Lowestoft and Harwich areas, the two last men-tioned areas having been heavily mined. The mining 6i the approaches to Harwich coincided with the bombardment of Yarmouth, and it is not improbable that the bombard-ment was for the purpose of inducing the Harwich Force to move northwards with the hope that it would run into the new minefield. A minefield of considerable extent has been laid off the Dutch Coast about 15 miles from Scheveningen and a special force has been made available to clear a wide passage through this mined area ; the. remaining portions of the field will then afford considerable protection from submarine attack to the flanks of convoys proceeding through it.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British Vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks :-Week Ended.

Warships now fitted with Paravane Equipment is 352.Investigations have now been made into the results of the dazzle painting of ships so as to ascertain as far as possible the value of this method of protection.Up to the 31st of December last, 583 merchant ships and 74 British warships had been dazzle painted and 31 attacks on these merchant ships have been recorded, 29 of which were attacks by torpedo. The percentage of attacks upon dazzle painted ships was higher than upon ships not so painted as also was the percentage of effective hits by torpedo so far as the hours of daylight are concerned, but on the other hand, taking the whole of the 24 hours, only 57.5 per cent, of torpedo attacks on dazzle painted ships were effective as compared with 73.8 which is the percentage of effective attacks on non-dazzle painted ships.In considering the number of attacks it must be borne in mind that dazzle painted ships have been employed to a much greater extent in Cross-Channel trade than in any other trades, and it is in the Channel where the greatest number of targets for enemy tor-pedoes are concentrated and where enemy submarine activity has been greatest during the last few months.It will be necessary to have further experience of dazzle painting before any final conclusions as to its value can be drawn, but the results so far appear to justify the development of the policy until further data are available.MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.Seven enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at, and five have sailed from, Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.   None have entered or left Rotterdam.Further information has been received which doubtless relates to the raider referred to in previous Appreciations as the S.S.&quot; Wolf.&quot; The Commander-in-Chief, China,.reports that a bottle was found by natives off Celebes on the 9th of December, containing papers pur-porting to have been thrown.into the sea by the crews of various vessels which had been captured, who were prisoners on board the raider.   The papers asked the finder to notify
the British Authorities thafthe raider had passed Celebes on the 29th of August, that she was formerly the &quot; Wachenfels&quot; of the German Merchant Service, that she had on board 110 mines, and that she carried seven 6-inch guns and had four 18-inch torpedo tubes.These statements are consistent with reports already received and may be taken as authentic. The raider is probably the &quot; Wachtfels,&quot; 5,809 tons gross, of the Hansa Line, built in 1913,; and the information which has now been; received from various sources, points to the fact that she was laying mines in the neighbourhood of Singapore early in September, that she captured the steamer &quot; Hitachi Mara &quot; of? the Maldive Islands on September 26th with which ship she entered Suvadiva Atoll, to the south of those Islands, on October 1st, and that she laid mines off Bombay at some date prior to November 23rd, and a little later captured the Spanish steamer &quot; Igotz Mendi,&quot; in the Indian Ocean.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.There is no recent information from the Baltic Fleet except that sailors from Helsingfors took part on the side of the Bolsheviks in the disturbances at the opening of the Constituent Assembly.The Black Sea Fleet is reported to be entirely demoralised, and it is stated that a further mutiny has taken place resulting in the arrest of 260 officers and the murder of 20. The Commander-in-Chief is reported to have been negotiating with the Ukrainian authorities for the transfer of the Fleet to that Government, but it is believed that this could only be effected by the use of force. ;There are at Vladivostok 1 British Cruiser and 2 Japanese Battleships. The latter gave no notice of their impending arrival, and protests from local and central Russian bodies are proceeding.   Japan&apos;s excuse is the protection of Japanese subjects.NAVAL STAFF,2tth January, 1918.[Appendices.
