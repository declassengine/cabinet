His Britannic Majesty&apos;$ Government)i This Document is the Property ofIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information, GNW/008Oolonel hmit368SECRET.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   NORWAY,    VIII. (Jan. 30th, 1918)Until the Autumn of 1915, no one suspeoted that there was a $ernan spy system of any importance in Narway.     The a*ts of Baron von Rautenfels and the revelations in connection with the spy trial at Bergen have changed this opinitn, and although the accused received light sentences in the Appeal Court, a very far reaching spy system has &quot;been uncovered and, what is of more value perhaps, a document published in translation by one of the Norwegian papers (Iforgenblad, 16. 12. 17)   entitled ?&apos;Aima and Methods of the German Intelligence Service in Scandinavia&quot;,    A few quotations will be of interest:-1)    To make use of ships trading with Enemy and Neutral countries.&quot;By this intelligence service our (i.e. German) U. Boats canbe shown, not only safe routes, but also objects of attaok&quot;........ &quot;We learn where hostile cruisers are stationed, etc.&quot;2)     &quot;Mates of ships, as they have small pay are better Agents thanCaptains.     Their fees should vary from 100 - 150 kronov ( 5.18)a month, and for Captains up to  30 a month.&quot; 3)    Travellers returning from an enemy country are worth cultivating.It is possible to obtain much information in a circumspect mannerby means of o harmless conversation&quot;.(4)     &quot;Personal connection with the Representatives of the Neutral &quot;Pressgive valuable results&quot;. (5)     Commercial travellers are most useful. &quot;It is not necessary ordesirable that a Neutral firm should know the traveller&apos;i* re 1object.     All the Agents should curry on u genuine business. For this purnose waiters, barbers, workers in metal for shin-
building yards and munition factories, and nurses, as well as ar-tists can be well employed.......We hax-e turned our attention toenlisting intelligent females for mir purposes, for experience shows that where men arouse suspicion a woman&apos;s story as a rule excitesnone......The danger of sending reports have been reduced to aminimum by our chemical experts in Germany who have prepared means which the enemy&apos;s chemical knowledge, on account of its inferiority, is not able to discover&quot;.     There is a ceference here to handker-chiefs which by dissolving give an invisible ink.&apos;     Such handker-chiefs were given by Dr. Fie-itner. to Paasche, who was arrested and in whose room the original of the above document was found. Further detailed directions follow for payment of travelling ex-penses, bribes, fees, etc     There is also a list of questions (87) on which information was desired and details of a telegraph code in which the ships equivalent is rendered in fish terms:   for instance :-&quot;Light Cruisers 2 funnels ^ Haddock.&quot; &quot;       4    &quot; Sardines.Submarines -s Tinned Herrings.The following &quot;send 3 barrels Madeira best market 443B t*Persson by steamer&quot; would read &quot;16 Aoril 9 am. 3 large Battleshipssteaming S.W. by S. to point 443 medium speed,   information relij;-ble&quot; &apos;Such r comptete&quot;show up&quot; of the uses to which their counthas been put as a spy centre has created a profound impression ^motio; Norwegians, and a strengthening of the law in this regard has bee&quot; submitted to the Storting.The war has had a remarkable effect on the development tit cer-tain industries in Norway, such as ship-building , where aJreMv a 500 Ton &quot;Concrete&quot; vessel the &quot;Nansenfiord&quot; has been built *t I&quot;oss in the Christiania Fiord, naf^has navigated the North sec.
doing a journey of 2000 miles, and is reported to have proved satis-factory so that the construction of such vessels has got beyond theexperimental stage.     The walls of the hull were only from Z% to 4inches thick, and by this so-called &quot;Fbugener&quot;system, the high pricedlabour of the steel worker and riveter is totally dispensed with.     Inthe mining industry there has been a Very great increase in the pro-duction of Molybdenum.     Before the war the total output of the worldwas about 200 tons a year, of which Norway produced a quarter.     InL916 however her output was 140 tons, and is increasing.     Germany,until now, alamst had a monopoly of the production of zinc-white, butowing to a new invention of methods for producing pigments, andfromespecially zino*white/titanIf erous iron ores, of whioh Norway has veryextensive deposit&amp;it is said that she may become the world supplierS 1of this commodity.     Another new invention is that whereby a moder-ately sized electro chemical factory may very cheaply produceelectrodes for its own use, which it is said will very materiallyaid in turning the water-power of the country to good account, \notherinvention important in the present food-crisis is said to be that ofa Committee of the &quot;Norwegian Provision Department&quot; which has succeededin making a margarine from fish oils, equal to any yet placed on themarket.An arrangement seems to have been come to between the War Trade Board of Washington and the Norwegian Commissioner, Dr. Nansen, where-by America   will release supplies for Norway, aggragating 500,000 tons, the conditions being that no food-stuffs be exported from Norway except 48,000 tons of fish-produce a year.The &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Government of Russia has been recognised by all the 3 Scandinavian countries, and Finland having been recognised as an Independent State, has been officially invited by them to take part in the next Scandinavian Conference, meeting probably in February in
jCopenhagen.    This means that Finland will share in the exchange of produots whioh has been agreed upon between the Scandinavian countries, and will thus possibly ease her food diffioultiee to some extent.
