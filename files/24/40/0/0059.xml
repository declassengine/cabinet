Intelligence Bureau,Colonel Jones235Department of Information.C 16.MEMORANDUM ON FINNISH POLITICAL OUTLOOK.The following are notes of a conversation with a member of the Finnish Delegation now in England, who himself belongs to theYoung Finn party aid who is likely to receive the appointment of-Finnish representative here when the British Government recognises the independence of Finland.     They put the Finnish view very clearly.&quot;We are pressing for complete independence because we do not see who can give guarantees that the future Russian Federated Republic may not again gradually or suddenly become autocratic, or representative of Prussianism in some new form, which will, in effect, say to us:    &apos;You are blocking our way to the Atlantic;   one small nation must not be allowed to hinder the development of the Russian nation&apos;.    We cannot forget that Kuropatkin in a secret report stated that 1 in order to, pursue our policy of aggrandisement we must go on and gradually reach the Atlantic1.    We regard the present situation in Russia as only temporary, and have to form our policy in view of the possibility that 20 years hence a great leader might again arise in Russia Imbued with the old ideas.   If we are left in any kind of a connection with Russia, that would mean a re-crudescence of the policy of Russificatlon for the possibility of obtaining a harbour on the Norwegian coast.   We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that recent railways have been constructed in Finland with Finnish money, which could be used to throw troops against Sweden and Norway.      Finland might easily be reconquered by Russia, so we wish complete independence guaranteed by the Great Powers, believe that Russia will again be Imperialistic.     The Russians
- 2 - ,jare not constructive in oharacter;   they have never developed the central parts of their own country;   they have simply followed a policy of conquest and aggrandisement, and have lived on the conquered peoples.    Their policy contrasts at every point with that of Great Britain, who, while she increased her Empire in the past, did not forget internal development at home as also in her colonies.&quot;We believe that Germany and Russia will enter into an alliance as a result of the war;   that Germany will take South Eastern Europe (the Balkans) an her sphere of influence, and leave to Russia the Northern countries.    This idea was developed in a series of articles by Colonel Bouveng, head of the Swedish Military College, in the Swedish pro-German newspaper Aftonbladet, in December 1914. Colonel Bouveng was on the Western front at the beginning of the war, and said that the German officers had told him that Sweden must enter the war in order to secure her ultimate independence, bacause after the war Germany and Russia wCuld go into alliance. His idea was that if Sweden came into the war at that tine Germany would always be grateful.     (The Swedes consider themselves to be of purer German blood than even the Germans)      If the Germans received help from Sweden in their titfe of danger they would never forget it, but if the Swedes stood baok they could not expect the help of Germany later as against Russia,    We are oonvinoed that if Germany and Russia form an alliance Germany will follow a policy of compen-sation in the Balkans, and we shall lose our independence.     In Beoember 1916 German agents were everywhere spreading (lying) rumours in Finland that the Finns were going to be conscripted because Great Britain and France were putting pressure on Russia in this connection. The opposite, of course, was BritainTs interest;    not to recommend the arming of 300,000 Finns to fight for Nicholas, which would have
been the final blow to Finnish independence, for these 30u,000 Finnish conscripts would not have fought for Russia;   they would either have been shot by the Russians or have deserted to the Germans.     I recollect a conversation with the Russian Senator Korevo at the time of this proposal to conscript Finnish troops. I asked him if it was true that he supported the demand that Finnish &quot;troops should be conscripted to be sent to the war;   would this not be following -the Prussian system to compel/Finnish con-scripts to fight for their oppressors?   . nYesf, he replied, *and I find it to be the right method.     Germany does not Bek-what the political aims of the people of Schleswig-Hoistein and Poland etc. are,when she conscripts them&apos;.     &quot;Well,&quot; I answered &quot;look at Great Britain: she has not compelled her colonies to fight.     They have done it of their own accord:   that is the result of granting auton-omy.    But you propose to apply Prussian methods and yet say you are fighting against German militarism&quot;.     In the end the Government was too afraid to arm the Finns and the matter dropped.&quot;Who are the pro-Germans in Finland?  Merely a small clique of Swedes and some of the Old Finns - conservatives and clergymen. We Radicals, on the contrary, fear, as I have already insisted, this future Russo-German alliance.     We, of course, hope that there will he a revolution in Germany which will prevent this danger, because a Bemocracy In Germany would not wish to re-establish an Autocracy in Russia.     In Finland the Social   Bemocrats are largely influenced theoretically by German Social Democrats but of the Minority group. Also, our commercial ciroles in Finland are hostile to Germany, fear-ing that she will get hold of our commerce.     Therefore we look to the Western countries of Europe and the United States in the hope that they, through a wise policy in regard to Finland, will provide them-selyes with a point d&apos;appui in Finland, in order to prevent the-
Baltic from becoming a German Sea;   that is to say, Finland, in order to maintain her independence, must rely particularly on Great Britain, France end the United States, and we do this with the more confidence because the democratic section of the peoples in Sweden and Norway are also pro-Ally.   The Swedish Democrats are pro-Ally and hostile to Germany, and therefore a-wise policy for Britain and France would place reliance in the democratic sections of the Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian peoples to counterbalance the influence of the pro-German elements in Russia.     If there are no large British and French political and economic interests in the Baltic, then the Germans will have no difficulty in completely controlling the fate of Russia;   but if there are four small countries near Russia dependent directly on Great Britain, France and the West, that will have some effect in preventing Germany from getting absolute control of Russia.&quot;In considering how we might work together to prevent the German control of Russia, we may suggest that from the economic point of view it might be possible to try snd follow a policy of penetration of Russia^ through,Finland;   that is to say, let Finland have e.g. flour/from the United States, and raw materials from the Western countries, and we would give as compensation licences to send goods through Finland.    Finns who know the Russian methods might be employed for Western business relations with Russia, just as the Germans make use of Swedes to a very great extent in Russia, and all through the war have been exporting many ^German articles as Swedish through Sweden end Finland.   The Germans fear that Great Britain will support the Finnish demand for independence as also the demand of the Esthonians - I would refer you in particular to the article by
iC ii tjC. Asche (jr) in the issue cf Dee.  3, 1917 of the Aftonposten, (Christiania) and that is one of the reasons why the Germans have occupied Oesel and Daghce.&quot;We Finns believe that our country will ultimately decide the policy of all the Scandinavian nations.    There was published &amp;n Sweden in August 1915 a book entitled &quot;Sveriges Utrikes Politik&quot; (&quot;&quot;Swedish Foreign Bolicy&quot;), which has been referred to ever since by the newspapers as the &quot;Bible of Swedish Foreign Policy&quot;.     The writers of the book were ammymous, but they are supposed to have been the leaders of the Swedish Conservative party, all of whom are pro-German.     In this book they emphasise that Sweden will have to re-conquer her place as the leading nation in Northern Europe, and that in order to do this she must once again conquer Finland, because Finland and Sweden united would give a population of 9 millions compared with the      millions in Norway and Denmark; that is to say, Finland united to Sweden would give the Swedes the pre-iominanoe.     That id the aspiration of the Swedish Conservative Imperialist party, whereas we in Finland - the majority of the Finnish people * object to all this, and it is only the small pro-German majority who to a certain ertent adhere to these views.     As an indication of this I may state that a little clique In Finland wished us to elect a Swedish or German Prince as our King, as soon as we declared our independence, and in the end of last Novwmber the Finnish Diet secretly discussed this question very seriously.   Not a single member of the Diet however dared to defend the establishment of a Monarchy.     On the contrary, the Diet unanimously passed a resolution in the beginning of December to the effect that Finland should become an independent republic.     This shows, rs far as I can see, in a most emphatic way, that all the pro-German and Conservative
I !Swedish aspirations with regard to the establishment of Swedish military supremacy in Northern Europe have failed so far as we are concerned, and, therefore, after this I anr convinced that the Governments of Norway and Sweden will have to follow the line indi-cated by Finland, because if we are hostile to Germany, together with the Norwegians and the Danes, then Sweden must see that she is surrounded by three peoples who do not agree with her pro-German policy.     During the war while the Firnc were supposed to be pro-German, Sweden could say that Denmark and Norway were pro-Ally and Sweden and Finland wo-German.     But now that Finland does not wish to agree to the Swedish pro-German imperialistic policy it will de-pend on the Finnish nation as. to what will be the relations between Russia and the Scandinavian countries:   If we are anti-Russian, that will safeguard the interests of the Scandinavian countries;   if we are the Allies of Russia it will facilitate the Russian aims with regard to conquering Scandinavian territory;   if we are pro-German it wiihl strengthen the influence of Germany in the Baltic Sea and diminish the influence of Sweden;   and, again, if we are anti-German it will strengthen the position of Sweden also.     Therefore, instead of the conservative Swedish belief that Sweden will become the leader of the four Northern nations, we Finns are fully convinced that it is we who hold the key to the situation, and that a purely democratic policy on out part will win the.consent of the democratic peoples in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.     (Population of Finland is 3,350,000: that of Sweden 5,500,000).     With regard to the Baltic provinces, an independent Finland will do everything to support the aspirations of independence in the part of the Esthonians.     On this point we think we will be in co-operation with the ideas of Great Britain, whereas the Germans will only pay attention to the wishes of the German nobility in the Baltic provinces.     There a Finno-Esthonian policy can succed only on anti-German lines, as the Esthonians could never co-operate with their former oppressors, the Baltic Barons.
&quot;With regard to the relations of Finland and Germany during the war I should like to say that the Finns were not so mush pro-German as afffei-Russian.     During the Russo-Japanese war the Finns were etrongr-ly pro-British and hostile to Germany because they thought that Germany was supporting Russia against Japan.     In order to escape Russifica-tion Finland wished to see Russia defeated.    Again in 1914 with the outbreak of war the Finns were really anti-Russian and regrefcted that Germany attacked England.     In order to save their position they wished to see Russia defeated and it had to be done through Germany, so that the assistance given by Finnish volunteers to Germany was not given with the idea od helping Germany per se, but in order to he$p her to defeat Russia so that the latter should be compelled to with, draw her tropps from Finland.    How we are asking for recognition from all the Powers.   Germany cannot defeat the whole world, and we I are relytmg on the moral supnort of Great Britain, the United States and France.      personally I was against any movement to help the Germans, but th,ere were very mnay who thought that they would fight against the Russians.   Possibly three thousand Finns in all fought for the Germans, and I would remind you on the other hand that several thousand Finnish sailors are employed in the British mercantile marine, and there have been many Finnn who wished to join the British Army. I Also there have been several hundred Finnish officers in the Russian Army.&quot;Finland will ke?$ the Aaland Islands. The Political Situation.&quot;In Duly the Diet passed a Bill according to which full autonomy would be established in all internal questions.     Only military and foreign questions were to be common to the Russian and Finnish Govern-l&amp;ents.   This was supported by the Social Democrats, the Agrarians, some Young Finns and some members of the Swedish party.   The result was that the Russian Government refused to accent the Bill and
. 9 4 9&amp; Ll Ldismissed the Diet.     Every candidate at the new election stood fpr the complete independence of Finland.   The new- Diet made a fresh draft of the Fundamental Law aiming at complete independence.   The Social Democrats; however, wanted our new constitution to he framed in acoor -dance with their law of July 18,   In that c?.:seN he supreme power would not he vested in the Government (* the Senate) and the president, as the Bourgeois Bloc desired.     Both parties compromised.   In the be-ginning of December when a Bourgeois Government was formed, the bourgeois parties refused to accept the ^uly 18 Bill, but they did accept its main provisions.     We proclaimed Finland an Independent Republic, and the supreme power was vested in the Diet until a further position could be taken up with regard to the new Fundamental taw. This is a matter that would be decided by the Diet alone;   so the situation at the moment is that the Government formed at the beginning of December, whioh was bourgeois, is still, so far as we know, in power, pursuing internal reforms and trying externally to obtain re-cognition of independence.     On the other hand the Socialists are very restless owing to the food scarcity and the disturbances in Russia, I think it is only right to add that the Swedish party, although the most educated, only compose one-tenth of the Diet, and exert little influence in Finnish political life.     Their social influence, is, however, very great, and most foreigners get their impressions of Finland from members of that party.     The Social Democrat party is particularly strong to-day however, simply because the Swedish party nave neglected to give political power to the people/  1 The aim of the Swedish party is to maintain the Swedish language and culture in Finland.     In order to do this they have had to keep down Finnish education in the Finnish language, and were also hostile to universal suffrage, and it is owing to their neglect   of social and political reform that all the bourgeois parties, Finnish and Swedish alike, are now suffering.
24. 1. 18.The speaker added that while gladly acknowledgeing the cordiality of the reception of the Delegates here, he feared that the with-holding of full recognition for reasons which he perfectly under-stood would he used to the disadvantage of Great Britain, the supposed champion of small nations, hy the pro-Germans in Finland and Russia.
