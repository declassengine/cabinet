DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT).38SECRET. G,T.-3407.WAR     0 A B I 8 E !,THIS SITUATION IK IRELAND. Memorandum by the Chief Secretary.In view of the critical condition of affairs in the Convention and the virtual certainty of a disagreement there as to the proper future relations of Great Britain and Ireland in respect of control of taxation and basis of commercial relations, I think it worth while to inform the War Cabinet of the information I have as tc the general state of popular feeling in the country.     The stiller tendencies which became apparent in ^ovenber and tha early part of December are distinctly sJaowia in swo later set3 of reports - those of the mail censor and those of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and both shew improvjnunt.The censor says with regard to outward mails,-nThere is an enormous increase of loyal letters &quot;from every class and district,   a point of &quot;interest is that the same arguments are used &quot;against the rebels by both educated and illiterate &quot;classes.      a careful examination shows that &quot;out of every 100 letters, 22 only were violently &quot;Sinn Fein, 18 were of a guarded and moderate &quot;Sinn Fein type and the remaining 60 were loyalist, &quot;denouncing the rebels and their activities.   Such &quot;writers claim that the Sinn Fein movement is &quot;already on the wane,    The large minority of &quot;writers (about 40$) who in October expressed no &quot;political opinion at all, now think it proper to &quot;disown and condemn the rebels, pronouncements by &quot;the priesthood in general and by the Cardinal &quot;Primate in particular, being frequently quoted &quot;in support of this attitude.&quot;With regard to the area of Western and SouthernIreland where most disturbance has existed, Galway,Limerick, Kerry, Clare. Cork and Tipperary, I havereports which give the information set out in thesubjoined extracts.
1 m 9 wEAST gal7/ay Sinn Fein is rampant throughout the Riding,but it appears to me that it is not of the viruleal type to be found in Cork and some other parts of Ireland, with the exception of a few dangerous adherents hera and there I have formed tho concluei that Sinn Fein is largely a pious opinion here, would become dangerous if allied to some popular land campaign.W2ST GALWAY Seriously disturbed in the police districts of IGort and Galway by Sinn Fein intrigues and par-tioularly raids for arms, firing on the persons., and firing into dwelling houses.KERRY Not much open hostility to the police asof late, though this may be with an object, and though an increase in the numbers of Sinn Fein Olubs, the enthusiasm is dying out, and there is not the real activity there was a short time ago.LIMERICK Sinn Fein Clubs are not so active as theywere and judging by external appearances the Sinn Fein feeling ia v.&apos;A- 30 snt-n^ Urib i.j .as for marly.?A change has ta^an place in their domoanour to theJpolice and their conduct in the streets is very much improved.CLAR3 The Sinn Fein movement more moderate, and lessdrilling: tho cessation of arreato for drilling has oausod many persons to give it up, und in many cases the drilling was only bravado.     A march of troops through tho county   had a good effect0     The relation between the police end tho people are not quite so strained an they have been,still, the old friendly feeling in lacking. EAST CORK , Sinn Fein continues active but does not seemto be making progress.     There is a decrease in the
T COBK -I)UTHIPFILRiKY.-number of cases of drilling reported and enthusiasm for Sim Fein is on the wane.    The, attitude of-Sinn Feiners towards the police is less aggressive.Illegal drilling- showed a narked decline during the month, not so much in the number of ceses as in the number of persons involved end the extent of the enthusiasm aroused.   This has been especially noticeable since de Valera&apos;s visit, there was no enthusiasm at his meetings end little interest in his speeches.   I believe if the Convention were successful in coming to a working agreement Sinn Fein would be thrown over.Drilling has been maintained and there have been raids for arms, but the presence of troops in Nsfiy-gh   ]ms had an excellent effect.in attempt to start trouble with the fclpperery Hunt came to nothing. , There were cases of drilling but the interest seems to be waning.To set off against these reports of improved coiio.it-ions I have police reports of a good deal of &quot;moonlidit-ingf in the troublesome mountainous area which extends from Llid-Galway southward and south-east, especially on the pert of armed gangs who cause terror by systematic raiding isolated farmhouses for arms, and reports from various quarters,-in Dublin and the Provinces which in-dicate a certain amount of desperate filing among the loss prominent leaders of Sinn Fein.   The more prominent men seem more and more inclined to transform themselves from street fighters into political extremists.   As to the conditions in the *7ostf Sir Bryan Lahon and the po-lioe he,ve arranged for systematic patrolling of the areas affected, which I hope may keep the mischief within bounds.   It has some seriousness, however, in &quot;conjunct-, ion with the steady gatherin^ in of &quot;mis by - rfislovrj.V ---- V-V O t,persons, from drunken soldiers, ill-guarded billets, and
isolated dwellings, and the avowal of a minority among the expo; of Sinn Fein that they will fight if they get a chance.The two sets of considerations which I have indicated a&quot;bc as to &quot;majority&quot; and &quot;minority&quot; feeling in Ireland appear to me to shov that if the Convention succeeds only in formulating the views of different sets of Irishmen, the publication of its ma; and minority reports ?ill probably tai:e place under cireumstane not altogether unfavo\irable for new action on the part of the Government.flntld)   H.E.D.81st January, 1918.
