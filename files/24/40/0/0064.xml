Military Attache! SECRET.Washington.2621.37233rd January, IP18.(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)A struggle is now in progress over 2 (?) hills which -.ave &quot;been introduced by The Senatorial Military Committee for a creation of a *7ar Cabinet and Director of Munitions respectively, sfter an acrimonious debate in senate on 21st January the President issued a statement declining to accept these measures.   The most significant feature of the present situation would appear to he ihat although parliamentary opinion has. been in conflict with the Resident before, this is the first time it has dared to expressitself vigorously in public-     The   situation is rendered more piquant by the fact that many democrats are torn between their iesire to stand well with the administration and fear of their constituents who are pressing them on alleged shortages in camp equipment.    It is highly probable that the President will get his way for the present but success now will probably not prevent any future shortcomings being ascribed to his refusal of these bills, and will hasten process of educating people out of their habit of regarding him as infallible.
