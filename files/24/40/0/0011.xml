ocument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1918.SECRET.G.T.-3411.WAR   CABINET.ANGLO-RUSSIAN MILITARY SERVICE AGREEMENT.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum which has been prepared in the Foreign Office together with a minute of my own on the subject of (the Anglo-Russian Military Service Agreement.A. J. B.Minute by Mr. Balf our.Mr. Howard Smithes excellent memorandum gives a very clear account of the present position as regards the recruiting of Russian subjects for the British army.This question may be looked at from three separate points of view: the point of view of the War Office, who want recruits; the point of view of the Home Office, who have to deal with the difficult question of the East End Russian Jews; and the point of view of the Foreign Office.  I confine myself to the latter.The most important, or at least the most fundamental, difficulty relates to the equity of the case. So long as Russia and Great Britain were fighting side by side, it seemed perfectly just that qualified Englishmen who wished to stay in Russia should fight in the Russian army, and qualified Russians who wished to stay in Britain should fight in the British army. Both countries had conscription; both were compelling their young men to join the ranks. Whether they should join the ranks on the Eastern front or the Western front was evidently a matter of secondary interest.But all this is changed now that the Russians have abandoned conscription. No Englishman is now compelled to join the Russian army. How then can we in justice now compel Russians to join the British army?It is no answer to this to say that Russia is still bound by the treaty of 1917,, and that this treaty is operative during the period of the war. This is perfectly true, and it would doubtless be a sound argument in a court of law. But it is not very easy to defend anywhere else. The whole basis of the treaty of 1917 was that both parties were exercising military compulsion. That basis has been removed, and, though in law the treaty may stand, the assumption on which the treaty proceeded no longer holds good. This will be obvious to anyone who reflects that, if we had not adopted compulsory service, We should never even have contemplated allowing Russia compulsorily to enlist British subjects residing in that country.A difficulty not so fundamental perhaps, but possibly even more embarrassing in practice, is due to the fact that the machinery for providing exemptions has broken down. Under the Act, the British Ambassador in Petrograd and the Russian Ambassador in London could give to their countrymen, in fitting cases, exemption from military service. There is now no Ambassador in London representing a Russian Government, and the nearest approach to such a representative is M. Litvinoff, who represents the unacknowledged Government which now holds power in northern Russia. If M. Litvinoffi is to be treated in this connection as having Ambassadorial powers, he will grant an exemption to every Jew in Whitechapel. If he is not to be so regarded, then we are in the anomalous position [192]
Memorandum. Anglo-Russian Military Service Agreement.The agreement, of which a copy is annexed, was concluded at Petrograd on the 16th July, 1917. It provides that each Government shall call its subjects in the territory of the other, who belong to the categories called to colours in their own country, to return to their respective countries for military service. Those persons who fail after due notice given to return to their own countries will be compelled to serve in the army of the country of their residence. The respective Ambassadors in Petrograd and London have power to exempt from military service any British or Russian subject without giving reasons. The agreement ceases to have force from the date of the conclusion of the war.His Majesty&apos;s Government enforce the terms of the agreement against Russians in this country by virtue of the Military Service (Conventions with Allied States) Act, 1917, and it may be convenient briefly to recapitulate here the terms of this Act.The Act empowers His Majesty by Order in Council to apply the terms of the Military Service Acts to the subjects or citizens of an Allied country with which a convention or agreement has been made, provided that-(1.) The convention provides that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in the contract-ing country has power to exempt subjects from military service.(2.) The convention provides that British subjects in the contracting country and subjects or citizens of the contracting country in Great Britain shall before becoming liable to military service in the. country of their residence have an opportunity, if they apply, of returning to their own country.-    (3.) The convention shall lie on the table of the House for thirty days before an Order in Council is made.The Act further provides that the subjects or citizens of the contracting country in Great Britain must apply to return to their own country within twenty-one days after the convention is laid before Parliament, and if they apply they must avail themselves of an opportunity offered to them to return to their own country, other-wise they will become liable for military service exactly as British subjects, and will have the same rghts as to tribunals, &amp;e, except in the case of a man who has applied to return and has failed to avail himself of an opportunity offered, when he will be immediately called for service, and will lose his tribunal rights.( His Majesty&apos;s Government decided in 1916 that some arrangement with regard to Russian Jews in Great Britain would be necessary, as great feeling had been caused, especially in the East of London, since British subjects were being called to the colours, and the Russian Jews of military age, who had mostly lived here all their lives, were exempt from service, and merely stepped into the businesses which British subjects were forced by military exigency to give up. It was, there-fore, natural that the convention raised considerable opposition among Russians in this country; but during the rule of Messieurs Miliukoff and Terestchenko it can, I think, be said to have worked satisfactorily.   Some 7,000 Russians electedof being ourselves in possession of a court of equity whioh if the case arose could deal with the hard cases of British subjects in Russia, while Russia has no such court of equity to deal with the hard cases of Russians in Great Britain.From the Foreign Office point of view, therefore, it would probably be equitable, and certainly convenient, that the compulsory enlistment of Russians in this country should cease. But this raises very important points connected with man-power and military service, on which the Foreign Office cannot offer an opinion; and I think that the Cabinet will itself have to deal with the question, which is of immediate and pressing importance.A. J. B.Foreign Office,January, 21 1918.
to return to Russia. All these were given an opportunity to do so (though only-some 4,000 availed themselves of it) and the remainder, some 25,000, have become liable for military service in this country.With the advent of the Bolsheviki to power in Russia, however, the position at once becomes complicated.     Russians who desire to escape military service &apos; -allege (1.) That as there is.an armistice between Russia and the Central Powersthey should not be forced to fight. (2.) That the Bolsheviki Government have definitely repudiated the convention. (3.) That, as Russians in Russia are not conscripted for the army, there isno justification for conscripting them in Great Britain. (4.) That there is no Russian Ambassador in London by whom certificates cannow be granted, and therefore the provisions of the convention and theAct are inoperative.The Ministry of National Service have proposed to call up all Russians who have become liable for service here, by general notice, and enquired the views of the Foreign Office on the proposal. Legally, His Majesty&apos;s right to do this appeared unassailable. By the Military Service (Conventions with Allied States) Act His Majesty&apos;s Government have full power to enforce the services of Russians in Great Britain (if not exempted by the Russian Embassy), who have had an opportunity to return to Russia but have not availed themselves of it. Such men are now deemed to have been enlisted and transferred to the Reserve, and can be summoned for service at any time. An armistice is not peace, and does not terminate the agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government have not received any notice from the Bolsheviki that they repudiate the agreement, and even if they do it is doubtful whether His Majesty&apos;s Government need pay attention to such repudiation of an agreement concluded with a Government which they formally recognised, if it comes from a Government which they have not recognised.The question was, however, discussed with the Director of Military Intelligence, since it was considered that to issue the general notice might lead to reprisals, and it was decided that the Ministry of National Service should coiitinue to call up for service individual Russians who are liable, but that the general notice should be postponed.   The question is to be considered at fortnightly intervals.This is the position at the present moment, but it is unlikely that the Russians will allow this state of things to continue if they can by any means prevent it, and present conditions make it possible for them to take various lines of action in the matter, which raise questions of considerable political importance: 1. Suppose that the Russians here succeed by their agitation in inducing His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide to call up no more Russians for military service, the object of the convention will not have been attained, and we shall be faced by the same social trouble in the East End of London and elsewhere which originally induced the Government to conclude the convention and pass the Act to enforce it. British subjects will rightly complain that these Russians enjoy practically all the privileges of British citizenship without bearing their fair share of its corresponding obligations. It is anticipated that this may lead to trouble, and the Ministry of National Service fear that it may very likely react upon Trade Unions who are now being asked to surrender more men from industry for the army.2. If it is decided not to call up any more Russians, it will be argued that there is no reason why we should keep with the colours those who have already been called up, some 3,100. The Russians will allege the armistice and negotiations for peace in support of this. The question has been exercising the War Office, and it must be remembered that there are numerous Russians in the Canadian forces who may seize on any decision taken here as an excuse to escape further service.3. The position of Monsieur Litvinoff further complicates the situation. In his present capacity he might claim to grant certificates of exemption, which we should, of. course, be unable to recognise. If, on the other hand, Monsieur Litvinoff&apos;s certificates are definitely refused, the Bolsheviks might reply by refusing to recog-nise those issued by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Petrograd, and call up all those British subjects in Russia who are now exempted for commercial and other reasons.4. An unfortunate state of affairs has been produced by the fact that the Russian Government made no provision for the wives and families of Russians who elected to return to Russia.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have had to provide
funds for the relief of these people, who complain that the relief given is insufficient, and urge that they should be sent back to Russia.5. Resolutions have been received from various Labour and Socialist organisa-tions, urging that the Government should discontinue calling up Russians, alleging that this amounts to persecution, and is contrary to the Prime Minister&apos;s declara-tion that Russia must be left to settle her own affairs.6. The Russian Jews are very highly organised, and are taking every technical point in the Courts, both here and in Scotland, which is possible, to resist being called up and handed over to an escort.   So far they have been unsuccessful.7. In present circumstances it would be impossible to provide tonnage sufficient to deport all Russians here with their dependents to Russia.I should like to add that I have consulted the competent officials at the Home Office and the Ministry of National Service with regard to this memorandum, and they agree in thinking that the question whether Monsieur Litvinoff is entitled by law, or is to be regarded as entitled by courtesy, to issue certificates of exemption to Russians here must depend on the general policy which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment intend to pursue towards the Bolsheviki. For this reason it may be considered desirable to submit the whole question to the Cabinet, and I should observe that any general decision on the subject, particularly if it were in the direction of allowing the convention to lapse, would concern not only the Foreign Office, but the Home Office, War Office, and Ministry of National Service as well, which Departments are really more nearly concerned in the matter.o
