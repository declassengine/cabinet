PROPAGANDA AT HOME.

MEMORANDUM BY SIR? EDWARD CARSON.

I am strongly of opinion that the mest valuable form of propaganda in this country would be lectures by wounded officers and by escaped prisoners of war. Such speakers have more effect than any others on popular audiences. I have been pressing upon the War Office the necessity for establishing a small group of officers to undertake this duty, but I have not been successful. The matter was first brought to my attention in connection with the case of Major C.B. Fox, D.S.O., of the Scots Guards, who was taken prisoner at the first Battle of Ypres, and escaped after three years of captivity in Germany. His experiences are so remarkable,and his knowledge of  Germany so vast,that Mr. Fisher, the Minister of Education, asked him to give addresses throughout the country. This he did, ? at the request of the Minister of Munitions he also spoke in Munition areas. He had an enormous success, holding ?tings of 5,000 and 6,000 men in Glasgow and in other places. A short time age he was summoned to the War Office and forbidden to speak at any further meetings - although, as he explained, he has been asked by two Ministers to do so. He has now returned to a Depot Battalion. On 31 December I wrote to General Macdonogh, Director of Military Intelligence, drawing his attention to the case, and in the course of the letter I said:-

&apos;I write to ask you whether some means cannot be devised to secure the services both of this officer and of any others who have had similar experiences.  Would it be possible to second them to the organisation of the National War Aims Committee or one of the Government Departments in order that they may address meetings in the country. If no other way can be found, could not they be put into mufti for the purpose?&apos;

I wrote a further letter on the 11 January, of which the following is an extract:-

It has been repeatedly urged upon me that, owing to the infinitely greater effect on public opinion produced in this country by speakers who have had actual experience as prisoners in Germany, this is the most valuable opportunity for propaganda we have at home. I understand that exception is taken that it would be a breach of the regulations, and I suggest for consideration that if a group of suitable officers were selected and directed by order of the War Office to address meetings, explaining the incidents of the war to the public, there could be no breach of the regulations. They should, of course, be ordered to confine themselves to the war.&apos;

I received the following reply from General Macdonogh on the 18th January:-

&apos;Your letter of tho 21st December, asking that Major Fox night be allowed to address meetings in mufti, has gone long unanswered because I have been in comnunication with the Adjutant General&apos;s Department on the subject. I have ascertained that there really are cogent reasons for not permitting officers, either in uniform or in mufti, to address meetings in this country. If you wish to press the matter, I would suggest that you should see General Childs, Director of Personal Services, in the first instance, and discuss the question later with Lord Derby, if you so desire.&apos;

I understand the objection to be that if officers are allowed to address public meetings, it would be impossible to prevent pacifists from using private soldiers as speakers at their meetings. I should appreciate this objection were it proposed to allow officers to address public meetings indiscriminately, but in my opinion, the analogy fails in the case of a proposal to establish a small group of officers, with the necessary experience for the express purpose
i -15- mit giving public lectureB on the war and the incidents arising out of it.    The public do nof require propaganda in the ordinary sense eojmioh as to be infomed.    Our greatest enemy is ignorance, and I do not see how any exoeption can be taken to the use of public money for the purpose of putting facts and facts only before the people. I m ooirriocad that political speakers of the ordinary type who are at present employed by the War Aims Committee,are of little, if ran/, use - and in many oases do more harm than good.I attach letters I have received from General Swinton and from lord Denbigh, which confirm the view I have expressed. I understand that the military authorities are necessarily bound by tho Army Regulations and oannot go outside them whatever their inclination, unless they have the direct instructions of the War Cabinet.     I think the matter is one which should be brought before the War Cabinet for early deoision.(Sgd) EDWARD CARSON.2,Whitehall Gardens, 8.W., 21 January, 1918.ENCLOSURE I. Copy of letter dated 9th January 1918 fromMajor-General E.D.Swinton to Sir E. Carson.My dear Sir Edward,Utilisation of Escaped British Officer Prisonersfpr PropagandaI have been thinking for a long time that we are missing a great opportunity in any endeavour we may be making to educate public opinion as to the true nature of the Germans by not employing as lecturers our escaped British prisoners.There are quite a useful number of officers who have been prisoners in Germany and have esoaped, or who have been exchanged, to form a useful focus for the infection of the ignorant portion of our nation.    The seriousness of the whole matter has been impressed upon me recently by the growth of pacifism and anti-patriotism of various types, a subject about which you know far more than I do. The matter has recently been brought to my mind more pointedly by the fact that I have met Major Pox of the Scots Guards.   Major Pox, who is an esoaped prisoner, actually gave a course of lectures in this country and for some reason or other his activities, which were, I believe, productive of astonishingly good results, have been ohecked by the War Office.My opinion is, and I think you will agree, that every possible endeavour should be made to use such officers and for an organised scheme for the purpose of educating our nation as to the truth. I therefore venture to address you on the subject.Yours sincerely,(Sgd) B.D.swnrion.ENCLOSURE II. Copy of letter from Lord Denbigh to Sir E. Carson.7,Queen Elm Square, 20 January,1918.My dear Carson,During the fortnight since I saw you I have given another 10 lectures with my maps, most of them to large military audiences with a considerable sprinkling of civilians (especially at Norwich last Thursday) and two to civilians - Mansion House and Leicester - the latter a remarkable audience of 2,000 last Sunday afternoon.What I have heard and seen at all the places visited and the great correspondence that has rained on me in consequence of my
3.48letters in the Times, has convinced me more than ever of the trying noc^s&amp;ity for7 some such propaganda as I am carrying on. ^The ;naps are a huge success and are in demand from all over the country.    There is no doubt whatever that a great deal of our ,n*epagan.la work at home in the paso has been utterly futile or there, ^rould not las&apos;-the extraordinary jlgaorance prevailing as to tho position whi^^ermany has now obtained, especially in the last, affid the intense dar^ar^j^Jcralicing of negotiations while she is in that positioh and unbeaten in the field0If we get beaten in this war through our- people jstting us down at home and being unwilling to stick it out, we shall desorve all we get through want of proper education in those matters..The ignorance has surprised we  -   I g oI- a letter yesterday from a good firm of foreign produce Agents in London and   Bordeaux - the head of tho firm writes   &quot;I am a plain business-man&quot;   and he goes on to sey that up to a fewhnonths ago ho took no interest in European politics and ho conceives his case is typical of at least 80$ of business people.   Ho says that during recent weeks he- has aaaually studied the question which he finds full of linterost and of danger.He advocates the placing of  rge scale maps, showing tho present situation and Gorman designs, in such places as the Royal Exchange, Stock Exchangej Baltio, Commercial Sale rooms, Hop Exchange, Com ditto, wool ditto and in all tho different   Exohanges in tho Provinces, news rooms at Liverpool &amp;c0, and vestibules of principal hotels.   I think this is a splendid idea and should be acted on without delay and some short pithy sentences explaining the position and the dangers would make the whole plain.    I think my Eastern map showing the Hamburg-Persian Gulf ; Bat lway s&amp;uld be easily and quickly reproduced, but for goodness1 sake let us get a move on. Week succeeds week aid nothing happens except that dangor at home increases,   itfy correspondent finishes his letter  rt0noe let the business men (   Biglond grasp what wo ar-e fighting for  - vix: our Empire1s existence - and all fads and faddists would require an epitaph11   -Ifve been rubbing this in all I know and peopUe grasp it qAekly from a map  -   but i?ra only one  - I most earnestly hope tho War Cabinet will ro-oonsider their veto on military speakers in uniform.. I c^ito see tho objection to giving general leave to officers to speak, but I repeat, surely the   Government is strong enough to sanction and defend the existence of a certain number of selected and approved officers as speakers - all working according to an approved text - and with these maps, for the purpose of enlightening the public as to the situation,     I tell people I am no-o going to talk any politics, for which  % have no, use these dayss but that 1 am simply there to put facts.before them in the liglro of a couplete story and let them form their own opinions;    People doivt want, to hear the ordinary civilian paid apoutors sent out by the War A ims Gpmmlttee - I*ve been told that again and again.      I have a letter before me from a local J,P. and Chairman of 4 local bodies in Bedfordshire, complaining scathingly of two of these spe akers who had been sent down to his district.Why cannot a staff of military speakers be f ormed ( there y.must be many good platform men in Khaki these days) and lent to the War Aims Committee who vould arrange meetings-.    I would liko to see the whole run from an office which vould keep in touch ?i th M.I, and the   W.A. Committee, and run by somebody with sufficient knowledge and discretion to call attention of speakers out on tour to eny new developments, extracts from German pross &amp;c&amp;c &amp;c9I am being pressed to go and address the London Chamber of Commerc where Paithfull Begg assures me Hhere is a darkness that can be felt I wold like to have a big meeting at the C)ueenfs Eallat an early date and I am sure we could fill it and many useful people vould come to t the maps * I think a big meeting at the Peoples Palace 32, might&apos;&apos; be useful and the War Office want me to go to Edinburgh and   Glasgow. Bui-no use going there end not getting at the civilians too and that I!m prepared to do.Yours very sincerely,CSd) DENBIGH.
